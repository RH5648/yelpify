The last straw was after taking my car in twice for brake problems they finally actually looked somewhere besides the wheels on the third time and much to their surprise my master cyclider was cracked and leaking badly. I could have crashed as these lazy bums were to clueless to even check the entire braking system.

3 for food 
4 for ambiance

Wow, this place has come a long way since it was a HoJos and we used to sneak in from the ASU dorms circuit 1983 to use the pool. Shhhh, did I say that out loud? 

I was lucky enough to visit this place twice last week. Once to eat before the show at Gammage. They give a same day discount which I did not even know about. A few days later I visited the hotel for a cocktail reception on the rooftop which got rained out. The reception was rescheduled to the conference room. We did end up on the rooftop later that night after the rain stopped. ( lovely view) 


The Normal diner is pretty funky and retro. I love what they did with it. The food is average but an upgraded, funky kind of diner food. Nothing to write home about but not bad either. I had a Cajun chicken sandwich which was okay. The fries however, were cold and not great. At the reception I did have their red velvet waffles and fried chicken and they were actually very good. These are also on the Normal's menu thus why I mention it. 

The gals working here are the best. Young and students of course. Go Sundevils. 


I might add on show nights you might want to get there very early. I was busy reading and eating and did not notice about an hour before curtain time people were eyeing my table, and me, like hungry Zombies. By the time I had arrived to find an empty restaurant to the time I looked up from my meal and great book the restaurant was packed.  

Speaking of books. They attach the bill to a book. LOl and yeah! I adore that idea. 

I want to go back to try all their drinks, treaties and other food items. Not bad. Check it out.",2016-04-16 21:34:44
Xbz1M9zmHYh6_G5L-E5q_w,JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,ii8sAGBexBOJoYRFafF9XQ,3,4,0,0,"This is close to a 2 star review.  I stayed 3 nights at Paris in late September/early October of 2016.  We arrived well before check in time (which is 4 pm).  My room was ready, which was great, but I was told there would be a $25 or so fee for early check in.  I didn't want to deal with the bell desk holding my luggage, so I just paid it.  But, it's frustrating when the room is sitting there cleaned and ready to go and they still charge you.  I get that Caesars is a corporation and needs to make money, but I feel like more and more places in Vegas (not limited to Caesars properties, see the parking charges at MGM joints now) are nickel and diming you at every opportunity.  Very annoying.

The room is below average for comparably priced hotels on the Strip.  The center of the room has a sort of wardrobe cabinet with 2 areas for hanging clothes on either side and a small fridge in the middle.  The room safe is in there as well.  It was serviceable and got the job done, but it had clearly seen better days.  Many scuffs, scratches, dings, etc.  2 of the magnetic doors didn't work, so you had to kind of rest of the door instead of actually getting it closed.  And, it is located in the center, which means they put the TV on the wall off to the side.  Not a great location and difficult to see from certain areas of the room.

The bathroom had a lot of counter space, which was nice.  There is a small square shower and a soaking tub.  It's similar to the basic bathroom at Bellagio, but not nearly as nice, smaller, and clearly more worn.  While we were staying at Paris they were doing quite a bit of construction (which was loud at times).  I don't know if they are renovating all of the rooms, but the renovation is a good idea.  Given other options on the strip, an upgrade to the accommodations is sorely needed at Paris.

The casino is decent size with several areas for table games, including the massive forest of slots and video poker machines that populate all casino floors.  The sportsbook is on the smaller side, but we were able to get a table to ourselves to watch college football on Saturday.  At a lot of the larger books this is difficult during football season.  But, we only had a cocktail waitress for the first half, during the second half of our game we had to go to the bar to get drinks.

There are some solid restaurants at Paris, including Gordon Ramsay Steak and Mon Ami Gabi.  Additionally, you've got several quick places to get a bite, including JJ's Boulangerie and the Creperie.  The line for crepes can get long depending on the time of day.  I haven't eaten at the Paris buffet in years, but when I went I recall it being better than average.  Also, during my stay, I never saw lines that were close to the massive lines you'll see at the more popular buffets (like Bellagio or Caesars).  

I would stay at Paris again if i were offered a good deal for the room, and if I had a newly upgraded room.  For the price you pay at Paris, you can get a much nicer room at other locations on the Strip.  But, if they renovate well, I'd come back.",2016-10-03 15:16:52

We waited a little at the bar and got seated within 10 minutes. Everyone ordered the all you can eat tacos and every round, you get a shot lol! Pretty sweet deal for I think $30? It's the house tequila they serve I believe. The shrimp tacos were the hit for them. I ordered chicken wings and nachos. The chicken wings were crispy and tasted like crispy pork skin chips. Decent size wings and juicy. The nachos were ok. I wouldn't order it again. It wasn't what I expected it to be. The cheese was just baked on and not stringy or gooey. The waitress could have told us that the kitchen closed at 10pm when we started ordering. They only had their first round of tacos then she came out with the ""10 minute"" notice that it's closing so put in the orders now. She came back with more tacos and shots but wish we didn't feel so rushed. I guess the bar is the only thing that remains open all night long. We want to come back during the weekend one day.

The world may never know, but luckily after reading this review, you'll know that it's a good place to go if you're looking for any of those things!

FOOD!
They've got a really solid kitchen, pumping out tasty goods to eat there or take away with you, and they're often bustling about getting ready to cater some fancy-pants party. (Fancy-pants party throwers take note.)

GROCERY!
If you're looking for a really great selections of all things adult (excluding ""beverages"" and ""entertainment"") ...I'm talking adult food here, like, stanky cheeses, olives, charcuterie, forcefully fattened duck/duck/goose liver, (fois gras,) and fungi that can be found only by trained pigs, (Truffles!), you're in a in a great place. Sorry for making all these things sound less sexy than they really are, they're all by far my favourite things to put in my face, ever.

They've got a decent, little selection of organic and local produce and meats as well making it a possible to do a fully high-end product refrigerator restock.

COFFEE!
They've got a full on Caf√© section complete with Barristers. Objection! I mean Baristas - that will making you a smoking cup of joe so tasty it should be illegal. Is it? I don't know - time to let the other guys step in.

It's a great place to meet for a quick lunch, take a meeting and pick up some Mans Eggs. It's a local supplier. Settle down. http://www.galimaxtrading.com/manseggs.php",2015-07-10 05:57:42

My table of four were early so we avoided the rush of people that seemed to swarm in at 6:30 sharp. Before we knew it the place was full, and with that comes slightly slower service. 

I had the veggie poutine app, and it was massive. A veggie burger second with a ""side salad"" that would rival most meal sized greens. Another in our party had a side of fries with his burger and it was equally as massive as my salad. My boyfriend had a burrito with a side of black bean rice and sesame slaw. The burrito and rice were great, but next time we'll opt for a salad in place of the slaw. It was just a bit too sesame-y for us.

I had a great time in Vegas, even though I am not a big fan.  I don't gamble and can't stand cigarette smoke. I was so happy I only had to share my room with one person and I was lucky my roomy was pretty cool.  The hotel seems a little lack luster.  The lobby and casino feel dirty and Samantha C. is right, the fake cobblestone is slippery.  Our room was very nice and we had a great view of the Strip and the pool at the Aria.  I didn't care too much for the pool at our hotel, the towels were so dingy and kind of raggedy.  The service at the pool was non existent.  I would have had a drink by the pool, however the server I called told me ""this is not my section"".  I asked her to send someone, two hours later we went back to our rooms.  Good thing I always carry water in my purse.  The dealers at the casino were pretty nice.  One of the moms wanted to play Pai Gow poker.

Great soups - be it dill pickle or white borsch or any soup of the day. Schnitzels are very tasty too (choice of pork or chicken) and why not?! Afterall the food fried and is dripping in grease. Their 'bouquet' of salads is actually a bouquet- I was never able to finish that much sauerkraut / cole slaw / beets / carrots / something else (you get three of those selections) salad.

A friend brought me here and i couldn't believe my eyes. I can eat as much salmon sashimi as I want!??!? I don't feel like I really need to go into much detail on how this restaurant works since it's been repeated with almost every review.  But here are some of my tips..

If you're a roll fan, you might want to look elsewhere before you decide to fork up $26 for the night. The roll menu isn't very big, well the menu just isn't very big altogether. But if you're like me, and have no interest other than for some good raw pieces of fish, then you'll enjoy your dinner just fine (more than fine really...). The pieces aren't the freshest you'll get in town but I don't usually set my expectations too high for AYCE sashimi option. On the bright side, they have AYCE OYSTERS too! They add this Japanese chili sauce to the shells which makes it even more delish! And if you're a risk taker, try the oyster shot. No questions, just do it. It's definitely an experience ;] Don't forget that if you order a handroll, you have the option of having no rice added .. save some room in your belly!

One thing I'm just not too keen of is the fact that dessert is an additional charge, $2 per mochi ice cream order..BOO! Usually skipping dessert wouldn't be such an issue for me, however, they have the option of red bean mochi, which makes it much more difficult to skip out on since I haven't been able to find it elsewhere. 

Hope all you sashimi lovers enjoy this little AYCE haven as much as I did. Happy eating!",2013-01-08 20:24:11

We had 2 amazing bartenders - forgot their names but the feisty curly haired brunette made our sizzlin' hot serrano sippers and gave us house made potato chips with French onion dip for free!  The male bartender (J name I think) kept refilling our waters and checking on us- wow!
I LOVED the drink - it was a blend of muddled basil and serrano with a floating slice of HOT PEPPER.  I bit into it and got watery eyes - YES!  We had a nice time here but opted to have food somewhere else (we were just gettin' started!)

It doesn't matter how organic it is if it's badly cooked or kept out in warming trays for too long. I might return for noodles some day, but nothing else.

The chicken sandwich I had was cooked to perfection, the cheese was excellent (I'm a dairy fanatic) and the veggies were warm enough to go along for the palate ride but still tasted fresh.  The right amount of chips were included, enough to provide a salty compliment to the mixture of tastes in the sandwich.

They do have a large selection of drinks ... lamely I opted for a Diet Coke ... but mostly because I knew I'd be hitting the sweets later in the lunch hour.  I'm all about caloric planning, haha.  Rachel C loves loves loves their Chai, so I'll be trying that for breakfast in the near future.  Rachel's veggie wrap looked absolutely fantastic while Amy's ham sandwich looked quite scrumptious.

I also like that we get to pick our actual seats (which is great for people like us who are often coming in right when the previews start). 

I will say that there are some things I don't like about SMG. First of all, you used to be able to ride the escalator from the box office to the movie theater. You now have to go outside and go up the stairs. Not a big deal but not fun in rain and kind of irritating. The other thing is that the last time we went, we noticed the seats were different. The armrests didn't lift up and the chairs were much more firm. We both agreed that we like the old seats better. Not sure if it was just the particular movie theater room we were in or if this was a change throughout. Finally, the bathroom is often out of toilet paper, soap, etc. Luckily I keep Kleenex and hand sanitizer on hand at all times. We get the Groupons and I hate that they've put restrictions on when you can use them (and even what movies you can use them on - i.e. does not apply for batman vs. superman) because it used to be that there were no restrictions and that, my friends, was awesome.",2016-04-01 19:43:25

Their poke bowls!! Feeling like a salad is boring and want something more fresh? Consider a poke bowl. I love the chopped raw salmon salad bowl and you get to mix it with toppings of your choice. I like my bowl to have fish roe, edamame beans, seaweed, corn and some veggies. Mmmmm so delicious. I thought the ingredients were very fresh and they were efficient with their service. 

LAST TIP??

Be adventurous and try different toppings or toppings you haven't tried before!! No matter what topping you put in your bowl, it generally is very good. :)",2017-05-06 20:27:36

Maybe it was a fluke, I don't know, but if every Chipotle's food tasted as good as this did, I believe the chain would become even more successful.

The flavors seemed more amped up than usual. Take the lime-cilantro rice for example. This is the FIRST time I have ever really tasted the lime! It wasn't overpowering, but gave the burrito a wonderfully tangy kick. That alone was probably the main reason it tasted so much better to me (and my roommate). The chicken also seemed like it might've had a tad bit more seasoning. I don't know but it was really awesome!

I almost did that here because I don't want whoever reads this to think my opinion of The Duce was clouded by my affinity for the team that won the World Series. Then I thought ""screw it!"" I can more than justify the five stars without referencing baseball.

My co-workers are full of good recommendations. The same guy who picked the last bar we visited in Scottsdale, chose The Duce for viewing game seven. I had heard of The Duce on Guy Fieri's (Triple D) show. So naturally, I wasn't going to resist this suggestion.

I love old buildings, especially old warehouses. Take a dash of quirkiness (the food is served from a trailer inside the building) add some variety (there is a DJ, outdoor games and vendors) and you'll have The Duce. The atmosphere here is better than most places you could visit in the downtown area. And the food and drinks are amazing!

To make you feel like you never left the mid-west, you can enjoy ice cold cans of Old Style, Schlitz, Old Milwaukee and Hamm's. If that doesn't float your boat, there are other fine choices available in a bottle or draft, plus a tempting, long list of drinks.

And the sliders are to die for! My friend and I split the Family Slider Sampler which consists of seven sliders of your choosing. Most of the sliders (the egg, the cheese and the chicken sausage) were really good and some (the brisket and the short rib) were beyond good! Seriously, the short rib was heaven on a bun!

There wasn't very much of a crowd on this Wednesday night, plus the Suns were playing a few blocks to the north. It didn't matter. The staff and bartenders were great and they enjoyed watching the game with the patrons. And the DJ played the Cubs victory song. It would be a stretch to say I felt like I was at Wrigley Field.

Our service was awesome. The Irish bartender was attentive, and our waitress was friendly, helpful with questions, and chatty but not too chatty. I loved the outdoor patio, which had apparently just gotten a fresh paint job and was still waiting on TVs, but did have a bar along with tables and stringy white lights. Love.

The fella got the Shepherd's Pie because we WERE at an Irish bar, and he loved it. He said it was warm and filling, and the lamb addition gave it just the needed kick. I got the open-faced turkey sandwich, which was sweet and tasty. I also swapped out the chips that came with it for the roasted Brussels sprouts. I had read some iffy reviews of the sprouts, but mine were great. They were actual, full Brussels sprouts (well, halved, but still) instead of the chips some people referenced, and they weren't too salty at all. I was in the clean plate club!

This is your typical TJ branch, they carry almost everything I was looking for. Theyre pretty good with stock and store was relatively clean. Location is pretty odd. I like that it is located in Henderson, perhaps its probably why TJ is here in the 'safer' and 'better' side of Las Vegas. Its located in a big plaza with other businesses and next to Dollar Tree.

Workers here were pretty nice. I was waiting in line to pay and other cashier who was done with his customer offered to ring me up and that was nice of him. I really like that the cashiers here always greet you first. I know it is not a hard thing to do but a lot of them dont really appreciate in doing that. Like I never hear them saying a simple 'thank you'.

This TJ also has a juice bar like other locations, always offering samples and fresh blended juices for sale. I actually never purchased one so I wouldnt know anything about the drinks. But when I tried the samples, they tasted...healthy & fresh :)

That said, my appreciation for the valley's vegan and vegetarian community over the last few years in particular has grown by leaps and bounds.  The lengths to which many of these restaurants have gone to make carnivores like myself feel right at home is pretty awe-inspiring.  I'm not sure if they're all hoping to transform me into a meat-free man (not gonna happen), but if their goal is gaining acceptance as a viable and desirable option for dining out, count me as an advocate.  Such is the case with Vegan House.  An Asian restaurant serving a mostly Thai menu, but not a single animal was harmed in the making of your meal.  I was in the neighborhood for a late lunch on Friday so I decided to stop by.

Vegan House is located on Adams Street halfway between Central and 1st Avenues right in Downtown.  The interior has a pleasant mixture of wooden furniture and wooden accents inside with both table and booth seating available.  The place can seat upwards of 50, but as it was a late lunch, I was one of only a handful of customers so plenty of seating to choose from this time around.  I was greeted very warmly by the owners upon my arrival and they were over the top friendly all the way to the end.  

I first received a small cup of warm vegetable soup in a miso broth.  A nice gesture and it was a nice clean soup, though honestly the broth was a little flat to me.  For my main course, I went with one of the chef specials on the menu.  The Fish Of Three Flavor had me curious from the first reading.  Tempura vegan fish and steamed veggies topped with a sweet chili sauce and served with rice.  The presentation of this dish was colorful, albeit slightly weird looking.  Came with two rather large pieces of this faux fish, and the way they were formed almost looked like someone stacked two giant pancakes on top of each other and then sliced them in half.  Fortunately, the taste wasn't nearly as peculiar as the appearance.  The tempura batter was excellent and this faux fish really did have the texture of a light flaky white fish.  I asked my chili sauce to be low on the spice scale (I'm a wimp with spice, sorry), and I really liked the mix of sweet and heat.  I poured on some of that rice a little at a time to soak up every last bit of that sauce.  For dessert, I turned to the FBI.  ""Say what?"" you ask?  That's the moniker they use for what the owner described as their most popular dessert item.  Fried banana with a side of coconut ice cream.  Four battered and fried banana slices, a big scoop of the ice cream and a few dollops of mixed berry sauce.  It wasn't too sweet, but a delicious combo and probably one of the healthier desserts I've had in awhile.

Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to about $27.  The price point was pretty fair given the portions I was served.  Not everything I had was a home run, but everything was certainly served to me with utmost earnestness.  And every dish was a good honest effort to make every meat-free item as flavorful as possible.  Nice people, nice restaurant, good food, fair prices.  That's something carnivores and vegetarians alike all want out of their dining experience.  Props to Vegan House for continuing to expand my horizons on meat-free pleasures.",2017-04-01 01:31:45

Or maybe mainly because the food is out of this world. It's a close call. 

Seriously, this isn't your typical bar food by any means. Pretty much everything we've tried on the menu is phenomenal, but chef Steve's wings are hands down the best. Of the maybe dozen or so things we've had off the menu, the only thing we weren't so crazy about was the pizza - which was still pretty damn good, just not our style (thin crust). Everything else is top notch and their house raspberry vinaigrette is to die for. 

The atmosphere is just the right mix of cozy and classy, it's very laid back but you definitely don't feel like you're at a small locally owned bar. Always really clean as well.

It's a casual, dive-y sort of place, which I like. There were a lot of different types of people there- firemen, loners, business men and women... It's got a huge interior, some cool copper topped tables, and some seizure inducing lights (far too blinky for an exhausted grumpy me). 

You order your food at a small window once you have mooed your way through an amusement park-like railing system (albeit a short one) and you specify a burger (or from a short list of other menu items), and your options are bun type and cheese type. At no point did I get asked to what charness I want my ground cow. Hence, I ate puck on a bun. Next time, I'll ask for medium. A third pound burger was plenty (they have half pounders, too), and the bacon comes in circles (which is cool- bacon in every bite is never a bad thing!).  We also had the 1/2 mushrooms 1/2 zucchini side, which was ok. We've had better and worse of both.

I just can't say enough good things about this place.  

Sure there are a few haters who claim they have eaten better sushi in Japan.  Yeah so what, I have too.  I bet not many (any?) here have eaten at as many Michelin starred sushiya's in Tokyo or other sushiyas all over Japan as I have and I still love Kabuto.  And the cardinal rule of evaluating Japanese food in the US with naive audiences?  Don't compare with what you can get in Japan--you aren't there and it's irrelevant.

Having said that, Kabuto comes VERY close to eating at a PROPER sushiya in Japan.  In some respect, it might be better than a LOT of proper places in Ginza as Kabuto has a good, I mean GOOD selection of white fish from Kyushu which a lot of edomae places in Tokyo who get fish from Tsukiji don't, but that's another story.  As some of us know, edomae really doesn't exist if you know what that really means besides from the style. 

I wonder how many authentic sushiyas are in the U.S. that didn't sell out and start making weird rolls.  I say 2 or 3 at most.  Vegas is lucky to have one.  If you can't appreciate it, don't go.  Leave those precious 10 seats for the rest of us, although I only sit at one of 4 counter seats.

Get the sha-bang sauce. It'll be the best choice you'll ever make in your life. I usually order it with their fresh shrimp. Add on some sausage that highly complement the sauce which in turn brings out the flavor in them. 

And the finishing touch - corn! I know it sounds strange and my dining companion didn't believe me either (he became a devout believer after one bite), but when the buttery sweet corn on the cob is covered with the sauce, there are simply no words to explain the explosion of flavors that makes you think ""wow, I've never had corn like this before!""

They make all of their eggs ongoing in anticipation of people ordering them and then they assemble the sandwiches as they are ordered. This would be fine, except the sandwiches are never heated through again, leaving the premade eggs/bacon/ etc to be cold with the cheese not even being melted on the sandwich. What a bummer.

While the food is standard across most locations, with some small exceptions, the service is not.  I have been to locations where the service was horrendous and the quality of the food was subpar.  Thankfully, this location is not one of them.

First off, the setting calls for more of a group outing than an intimate date. Long tables where you are seated directly next to your neighbour. The space between each patron is adequate but there is no 'official separation' between each seating. 

Very nice touch to overall atmosphere as there is an open concept kitchen where you get to see the head chef at work as she finalizes each dish and ensures the platting is up to her standards. 

Diversified menu with many interesting choices. Now here is where I think the discrepancy lies. All items are priced between 10-15$ or so, some are really worth it (especially the ones listed lower on the menu aka heavier on the meat side) whereas the more veggie and fish oriented dishes really fall short of their price tag.

We started off with the zucchini flowers stuffed with feta. It was a delight to try as it's not something you often see in the Montr√©al restaurant scene, but two small fried flowers for 12 dollars is a bit of a stretch. 
We followed by the Tuna lakerda, which was basically three pieces of tuna sashimi in a middle eastern flavoured marinade. Very disappointing ... 11$ for 3 pieces of thin tuna? It doesn't matter how flagrant the sauce was (which was on the weaker side)... but unless it's blue fin tuna, that's way overpriced!
Then came the grilled eggplant topped with cheese. Very tasty but yet again, small and hard to justify the price for a purely veggie based dish.

Things did get much better from there on as we moved onto the meat dishes. We had the lamb tartar (less gamey than I would have expected, needed a bit more seasoning though), the lamb koftes (lamb meatballs - my favourite dish of the night - this was so good that if I ever went back, I'd order 10!) and finally the fried chicken (perfectly done, crispy and well seasoned batter). 

Were we still hungry after this? No, but we found that it should have cost as much as it did. 

Otherwise, the service was excellent as the waiter was very attentionate and knew his menu and wine list to every detail. 

All in all, it's a decent restaurant with a good atmosphere and rather innovative menu for Montr√©al standards. If you go stick to the bottom half of the menu and you won't be disappointed!",2015-08-11 21:33:01

Now, one major weakness.  I saw that they have beef bulgogi on their menu.  I got excited that they had this.  Usually, bulgogi is a korean dish, but I was hungry and decided to order it as well.  Word of advice:  Don't.  It was really really chewy and rubbery for me.

I was soooooooooooo excited to try this place after seeing all of these noodle pulls on Instagram. I showed my husband and he knows that my love for noodles is ridiculous. So we decided to order to go...they have an online system but it's hard to customize such as no onions and such so we decided to just call. We were able to order with our specifications and the outcome was delish. There's a lot of protein and plenty of noodles when we got it. I would def recommend dining in though just because the seafood does get over cooked when you get it to go unless you live 2 min away. I was excited that I found a noodle place that wasn't the same. 

We came back another time and I had ordered to go on our way there. They told me 30 minutes so by the time we got there we still had 10 minutes left. My husband went inside and he texted me saying that a to go order was ready! That was fast thinking that was ours. Well it turns out that the lady working there said it was NOT our order. He texted me 10 min later saying that he was still waiting. I asked him if we could cancel and he said he already paid since that was the 30 minutes that they had told us. He waited another 10min and that order that was ready when he got there? Yea that was ours! The lady didn't even apologize for making us wait another 20 minutes for food that was all ready ready. Not cool! This experience has left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and I think I'll be skipping this place from now on.

We went during the middle of the week and it was pretty dead inside.  Thankfully, I didn't make a reservation for our first visit.  I would have looked like a dork.

Fiamma doesn't look like much from the outside, but I had heard and read good things about it, so I wanted to give it a shot.  Once inside, it's very nicely decorated and, for lack of a better word, ""quaint.""

We were greeted promptly at the door by the manager (I'm assuming) and then again at our table by our server.  Everyone was super-friendly.  Our server ran down the list of specials.  It took him about five minutes, there were so many.  My mouth watered more and more as he went on and on.  

We ordered our wines and two appetizers.  One was a Buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes and the other was a platter of fried calamari, shrimp, and zucchini.  I liked that they had this option of a combo appetizer platter.  It allowed us to try a variety of fried goodies (covered in a light tempura batter).  The marinara sauce that accompanied it was delicious, too.  It was very thick and flavorful.  No Ragu here!

The bread they brought out was fantastic, too.  It was thick, moist, and hearty, and tasted even better dipped in their homemade pesto dip.  Mmm...we couldn't stop eating the slices...and then they brought more!  

After two apps and two helpings of bread, we were already full.  Then, of course, the entrees came (after a little lime/lemon sorbet to cleanse the palate!).   It was tough to choose an entree from the menu, though, because nothing was average-sounding.  Everything sounded exquisite and was a gourmet take on traditional Italian entrees.  I wanted to try them all.  I love not finding traditional spaghetti or ravioli on an Italian menu!  

I finally went with the black linguine with shrimp, covered in a spicy red tomato sauce.  It was definitely spicy and definitely delicious.  My partner went with my other option, which was a linguine with a cream sauce and a variety of items sprinkled throughout it.  It, too, was very delicious; it was very creamy and flavorful.   We didn't have one disappointing food item.  Everything tasted so fresh and authentic.  

And, again, the service was fantastic.  At the end, because the restaurant was so slow I think, our server even brought us a complimentary glass of their homemade limoncello drink.  I was excited since I've never had limoncello before.  It made for a tasty, sweet ending to our delicious meal and excellent experience.  We were SO full the rest of the evening, but it was SO worth it.  Fiamma was fantastic.  We can't wait to go back...but will probably eat less!  Well...maybe not.",2009-01-08 16:50:04

For real though, you can go camping inside the city when you step foot into Camp Social. The moment you walk in, you feel like you've just teleported to a cozy camp-sight, full of fun. You are greeted by happy campers (hehe, see what I did there?) and beautiful decor, complete with amazing carved wooden bear statues. It's easy to get lost at this camp-sight though, it comes complete with drinks, a game room, tire swings, and s'mores. 

We celebrated a birthday last night, and had fun being touristy -- my girl and I were immediately asked ""first time here, huh?"" Wonder what gave it away, lol (ok, not really). We roamed the grounds, taking pictures and taking everything in while we waited for the birthday girl to arrive. We finally made our way to the bar, where we squealed with joy acted like 5-year-olds because of the tire-swings. (Yes, we totally did.) When we remembered how old we were, we adulted and ordered some drinks from the bar. I ordered the Arizona Summer, delicious and refreshing, not too sweet, which was perfect. My friend ordered the Babe Bubbles -- rose all day; can't go wrong. 

Once our entire party arrived, we were sat at a cozy table and ordered some appetizers. They presentation of the food was absolutely superb! The food though... it was okay. We ordered the Campground Vegetables (assorted grilled veggies), Yogi Bear's Picnic (meat & cheese board), and The Twist (soft pretzel & cheese dip). For our main meal, my friend and I split an order of The Chickpea (hummus, served with bread and veggies),  Phoenix Rising, and House Fries. Here is my reason for the 3-stars. The Chickpea, I was not a fan of -- the hummus was a bit too smokey for my liking. I felt like I was eating hummus next to a camp fire and took a big gulp of smoke with each bite; not my thing. The Phoenix Rising was too crispy and fairly dry, even for chicken. My favorite thing that we had ordered was the House Fries -- they were delish! 

For desert, the birthday girl got s'mores and of course she shared! Absolutely fabulous s'mores presentation and taste. They definitely put a spin on s'mores as I bit into it and instantly got a yummy mouthful of ooey gooey marshmallow, melted chocolate, on a graham cracker that had a hint of gingerbread -- which I love!

Overall it was a great experience, good fun in a laid back atmosphere.

The restaurant is quite quaint, with odd decorations here and there, with TVs, and a 10 person patio. The service was pretty slow, and they did get some of our order wrong. (We asked for a coke, we got a corona. We asked for steak, and they gave us beef). Go to this restaurant if you're not in a rush, and have some time to sit and chat. What makes up for ALL of that is the chef. He is the sole person that puts everything together before and after it hits the kitchen. You can tell he REALLY cares, and his dedication to everything being assembled correctly is quite respectable. 

FOOD:
Quesadilla (chicken) |$10.50| - The first few bites were delicious, but then it started getting to be too much, as there WAY too much cheese in it. As the cheese cools, the more rubbery the cooled cheese is. I stopped after one piece. 
Chimichanga (beef) |$13.5|- Fried quite lightly, which was nice. It was good, but again, the same cheese problem. The beef is better than the chicken.
Tortilla chips: we got some with our meal, and it was really good. It is freshly fried, as we watched the chef cut pita wraps, and deliver them to the kitchen for frying. 

Spicy level warning: mild was not spicy at all. With each bite, I dipped my food in the delicious hot sauce that is available on the table. 

To try next time: 
Sangria: Although I did not try it, it looks really good, with lots of fruit inside. 
Nachos: HUGE. Definitely shareable with 4 people if you are also getting a meal. 
Guacamole: a lot of people ordered it, and like I said, the chips are delicious. 

They also have taco burrito platters for 2 person (4 tacos + one burrito | $23) or 4 person (8 tacos + 2 burritos | $40). I may or may not have just ordered wrong, so I would definitely go back for another try. If you haven't been, it is definitely worth trying!",2015-06-25 16:48:49

The food is decent (we had omelets, one with home potatoes and one with hash browns); nothing super exciting. The omelets are pretty big, so you get a decent amount for the money.

The place isn't that big, and was about 2/3 full when we went, and there were 6-7 servers/runners. You might think that would speed up operations, but it seemed to slow things down. We sat near the kitchen pass-through and were privy to all of the confusion. Although unorganized, everyone was nice.

My Cali Mix omelet was supposed to come with avocado, jack cheese, and sausage. I was staring at it weird because I didn't see any avocado. An attentive server noticed my look and came to ask if everything was ok. When I said I thought it was supposed to come with avocado, she said no. I said I was pretty sure the menu said it did (also, it has ""Cali"" in the title, which nearly guarantees it). She went to check and brought me back a side of avocado and apologized. We didn't notice until the end of our meal that my partner never received the rye toast that was to come on the side of his, but we didn't really care as he wasn't necessarily looking forward to a side of toast, and he barely finished half of his omelet as it was (and he can usually finish most meals easily, so that shows you how big those omelets actually are).

The soup that came with the lunch special had unusually sweet broth. Unfortunately, this carried over to my entree as well. I love pad thai, but I could barely eat my dish because the sauce was cloyingly sweet. I ordered medium heat which was very mild so adding some extra chili sauce helped combat some of the sweetness.

My husband got the green curry which he liked, but not nearly as much as our neighborhood place. The portion was pretty small, and he left hungry.

I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. After hiking the Deer Creek Trail, there was sufficient time to make it to New Grand China to try their lunch special. 

   New Grand China is a full-service Chinese restaurant. When I walked inside, the woman working here told me to sit anywhere. Then she set the menu on the table. I went right to the lunch special page. I noticed that the majority of the dishes were either $6.25 or $6.95. I decided on the shrimp chow mein with wonton soup and hot tea. 

  Their default soup is egg drop, however, an additional $1 upgrades it to wonton soup. I have never tasted bad wonton soup. Wonton soup is up there as one of my favorite foods. This wonton soup included a couple of wontons plus a shrimp. I enjoyed it as much as the entr√©e. 

  The shrimp chow mein combo included fried rice and an egg roll. The shrimp chow mein was soft noodles interspersed with some shrimp. 

  As far as service, I've seen far better. It doesn't look good when the majority of the staff stops running the restaurant to eat lunch. There were more employees at the table than there were in the restaurant. With the majority of the staffs attention focused on their lunch, it caused a delay in my Waitress checking up on me and bringing the check. The check came out to $10 and change. 

  The reality is that New Grand China is neither new or grand. In my eyes they are an ordinary Chinese restaurant that I would pass over going out of my way to visit.",2016-08-29 04:36:24

WOW! Walking in I felt the heaven's had opened and the choir was a-singin'! This space should be my home. Beautiful, modern decor with the right lighting casting a soothing blanket of warmth. Nice. Greeted immediately we sat at a high top table near the window. I was so consumed with the fabulous company I was with I hadn't realized something. We. Were. The. Only. Diners. A few bar flies scattered around the bar in the middle of the room. 9:15 on a Thursday. My heart sank. Or was I actually slipping off the bar stool from those two $9 beers from the Mercury game? 

The good:
Well, service was swift and friendly. Though he seemed a tad nervous. Perhaps because we smelled of lesbians. Not sure. 

Ambience. Duh! Covered that. Including the restrooms and the glassed in elevator shaft. I still get dizzy just thinking of that!

PIZZA. Yep. I never would order pizza in a non pizza place. Rickie did. Rickie won. Rickie ate. Carne pizza. Order it!

The bad:
TINY martinis. Who makes these? Barbie? Tattoo from Fantasy Island? The Lucky Charm leprachaun?

Empty room. Bummer. I like a good, energetic, lively vibe. But we did entertain ourselves with lively banter about nothing important and most certainly became shallow and caddy. Realllllly, makes you want to hang out with me, eh?

The ugly:
My sandwich. The prime rib, with thick slabs o bacon, fried egg on ciabatta. Steak Umms. Was all I could compare it to. So disappointed. One thin, thin, thin, strip of, er, um, prime rib *cough* *cough* Steak Umms. Dry. Bland. Overcooked. Like my Aunt Helen after too much Chardonnay at a backyard BBQ.

Either way you look at it, this location sucks.  I went to the other Boardwalk Billy's and enjoyed myself they were a lot nicer and their point of sale was able to accept my credit card payment unlike yours.  Also with regards to your comment about me being Elite that's so childish.. me being Elite has nothing to do with the way you treated me so nice attempt to sway the attention away from your blatant disrespect and highly egregious lack of customer service.  Job well done.

If you love being belittled and talked to like you are a child then this is the place for you!   

Also just a heads up the most recent food inspection score I could see they were cited for personal cleanliness before.  The complete detail is available.

After already being seated for about 20 minutes and the other person in my party having a few beers, Aaron the server decided to come to my table to tell me that and I quote ""since we are getting busy and people are coming in, turn down your music or turn it off""  All the while the music on the patio is blaring something talking about demons and I don't stand for that.  I asked for the manager and Aaron got an attitude and told me ""for what because I told you to turn the music off"" I said yes you are absolutely right.  Aaron came back outside and told me that the manager was busy and he'd be outside to speak with me in a little while.  I waited for over 15 minutes for the manager ""Dustin"" to come outside.  In the meantime I spoke with the only other customer outside on the patio with us, they said they had no issue with my music and couldn't even hear it.  Dustin then finally came outside.  He came outside seemingly cocky and said what can I do for you.  I explained the situation as described.  I also told him that the only person outside with us said they didn't have any issue with my music nor could they hear it.  I explained that the music playing from the restaurant was too loud and we didn't want to hear it since there was objective material not fit for the whole family playing.  Dustin told me that he wasn't changing or turning the music off or down and that this was private property and that's the music they play and if I had a problem I could leave.  At the time I had food from across the boardwalk because Boardwalk Billy's point of sale system was unable to read my payment method.  Since I couldn't order food from here I went there.  Dustin proceeded to tell me that since I wanted to complain that I needed to get rid of my food from the table that it was a healthcode violation, I told him that was fine since I was done anyway.  He stood there and asked me again to throw it away as if he was going to wait there the whole time until I performed the task for him as if I was his slave.  There were still paying customers in our party.  All the while no other customers were sitting outside on this patio.  As I finish this complaint submission we are the only customers sitting out here.  I'm appalled that you allow your employees and managers to act in such an unprofessional matter.  They literally told me that if I didn't like the way they ran their business to leave that it was private property.  I can promise you this, I will never set foot into a Boardwalk Billy's ever again and this experience is a shining star example of why I don't patronize this establishment.  Since you all want to talk about violations I'll also go ahead and file complaint with the Mecklenburg County Health Department and Code Enforcement because I watched some of your employees go and touch ready to eat food without properly washing and sanitizing their hands.  I'm not going to be disrespected and belittled in front of public so your managers can feel better about themselves.  I asked for Dustin's supervisor and he brought me out a comment card and told me to go on there to write a review.  I did not ask for a review/comment card.  He obviously did not want me to reach any higher than him since he thinks it's okay to treat customers in a disrespectful manner.

As usual, I did some recon, and checked out the Yelp! reviews to get a sense of what to expect.  

After doing so, it sounded like meeting here for lunch during the work week might prove overly optimistic.  There were many comments about limited seating and long table wait times.   That's not what I'm looking for when trying to avoid my co-workers eye-rolling when returning from lunch ""sometime"" in the afternoon.

Well, I'm happy to report, I was pleasantly surprised.

We got there around 12:15--not a confidence inspiring time to begin with- and indeed the place was fully occupied.  One more group was waiting ahead of us.

Our first thought was ""Good luck - everyone just got here, so the whole hour will be shot.""

Not so.  The turnover was decent, with some people already finishing lunch.  The wait was roughly 10 minutes.  We were then seated by a very pleasant waitress, who continued to impress the whole meal.

I'm not a vegetarian... I'm not ""anything"" per say when it comes to food, other than I generally try to eat food that is:  a) delicious, and b) will not kill me prematurely. 

That being said, just because a meal lacks animal muscle does not mean it's ""good for you.""  There are plenty of fat-laden, heart-stopping vegetarian dishes served in restaurants.  

Here?  Maybe one or two (see the brie / caramelized onion Panini), but overall, pretty decent choices for a healthy lunch.

I opted for the frittata and a salad.  

The overall portion size was perfect for lunch, and flavor-wise quite satisfying.  I appreciated the frittata being complemented by chunks of sweet yam to mix it up a bit, while adding some contrast.  Where other restaurants may have loaded it up with sodium to make it taste good, here they opted for more diverse and healthy flavors.  Some may call that bland, I call it intelligent.

The service was great, from the moment I walked in the door.  It was attentive, without being annoying (after all, this was a ""business lunch,"" and there were things we needed to discuss).   The smaller size of the restaurant also made it more conducive to conversation.

Will I go back?  For sure.  It's now on my list for places to return.",2011-03-31 16:01:08

*Other than their brick and mortar store, Pancho's bakery also have food trucks and I remember seeing them at most of the festivals in the GTA. Hence if you are unable to make it to the stores, look out for their food trucks!

-Churros (filled with chocolate) - $1.50: 
The deep fried churros was crispy outside yet soft and warm on the inside. I have tried both the chocolate and the dulce de leche fillings previously and I preferred the chocolate than the other. The dulce de leche was essentially sweetened milk and had a similar texture to caramel, however it was a bit too sweet for my liking. With that said, you can taste a slight bitterness in the chocolate, which made the churros not overly sweetened.

My only complain (hence the -0.5 in rating :p) was that they aren't very generous with the fillings, as it didn't go all the way in and was just enough on the surface.",2015-10-19 19:53:21

It's a traditional Irish pub with dimly lit corners that kind of feels like your living room (OK, depending on where you sit). It's laid out onto two floors, with terrasses in front and out back. Upstairs, you will find a cozy corner, equipped with a fireplace (See? Just like your living room). Despite it's size, on weekends, they really pack it in and you will often find yourself standing. On occasion, you will feel like a sardine but hey - that's the price you pay when frequenting one of Montreal's best pubs. That said, the vibe is awesome and you easily forget that you don't have a seat. 

In terms of food - love it. Their fish and chips are amazing (the batter is super crispy), and the Hurleys Club is equally good. They are very generous with their portions and if you've got fries coming your way, you HAVE to ask for their curry mayo. It is SO good. 

There's live music from some pretty awesome bands (like Salty Dog and Solstice) from Thursday to Saturday night, if I'm not mistaken, so it's a great place to hang out with friends and/or meet new people.",2013-02-27 23:45:38

You enter the dinky liquor store and it couldn't be more anonymous, but if you just stay true (Navy term I believe) there is a staircase that leads down. Normally this is a bad sign, never go downstairs in a dinky liquor store - this one is the exception. I find the experience to be a little Narnia-like.

I've been here twice now. I've had the wings, the pizza (double-dough, sausage), and the chicken parm. My wife got the linguine with clam sauce both times and loved it.

The wings are totally awesome, no kidding. I lived in Buffalo for two years, so I know good wings. These were cooked perfectly -- crispy and tender. Sauce was good (not great, not Buffalo, but good and hot). I'll get these again.

The pizza is some of the best in the valley.  I'm partial to NY style pizza but this double-dough style is really good. Sauce is a bit sweet, but the sausage is awesome and the cheese is great.

The chicken parm was okay, not great. I'm guessing it's not a Chicago specialty. I wouldn't get it again. And it doesn't come with chips or any side, which surprised me.

The beer selection is subpar. You have to get a bottle to get anything good. Nothing good on tap.

The ambiance is great with a couple of exceptions. The music is psychotic -- 70s depressing music. And the benches are all worn out, so if you sit in a booth or along the wall, you'll sink so low your knees are practically up to your chin. Aside from that, it's a great feeling.

This location is close to Mississauga Chinatown, in a strip mall, WITH parking.  Restaurant itself is also larger.  Parking definitely makes it waaay more accessible and convenient!

Feeling like Korean Fried Chicken (KFC), I had a choice of Sikgaek and another, newer restaurant nearby.  However, after comparing menus, the other restaurant appears to just offer KFC and other snacky type foods.  Whereas Sikgaek's menu has more variation, including the traditional stews.

We ordered the:  Kalgooksoo (noodles in soup dish) and half an order of Padak (KFC with thin green onions on top).  Kalgooksoo was the usual, good, broth is subtle tasting and gets thicker, noodles get less chewy as time goes on.  The half order of Padak was absolutely HUGE, good enough for 3-4ppl, but I don't think they offer anything smaller than half a chicken.

My friend and I agreed that the Padak was well fried, not too greasy, very crispy, with the meat still juicy.  However, the batter itself lacked taste.  No S&P at all.  So, although it was decent, I'd order the Sweet & Sour one, with sauce, instead as I think that there'd be more flavour!

I made a reservation and we showed up 10 mins early. So we had to wait. Off to the bar we go, where I ordered a cocktail and watched some football. We waited about 15 more mins, then we were 'accepted' to sit on the waiting seats behind the hostess stand. Great.

Sat down and went to the salad bar, which was pretty good, but not as extensive as I've seen at other churrascarias/ all you can eat meat buffets.  The seafood pasta in the cream sauce was my favorite.  The only sauces available here were 2 kinds of Chimmichurri, no horseradish creme sauce or regular horseradish which I typically enjoy with my steak. Only green I saw was Kale and that was actually pretty tasty. 

The guys cutting the meat did not smile. In fact, I don't think one of them cracked a smile the whole time, they definitely need to be more friendly.  They looked like they were in pain each time they came over and would rather be hanging themselves than working.

I also never saw Lamb. I looked and looked for it, but it never showed up. bah bah lamb.  I think they only have 1/2 of the options they tell you they do.  The most memorable items were:  the bacon wrapped scallops, grilled shrimp, and the roasted crispy chicken.  The steak for me was Outback at best and again I did not see as many options as I thought there should be.  The trout and other mystery white fish should be avoided.

No dessert options either or at least a little something sweet to eat would've been nice.

Taking up the old Coronado house that formerly housed the Lisa G Winebar, The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe offers high quality salads, sandwiches, and other assorted snack goodies at an incredibly reasonable (see: one of the best deals in town) prices.

According to New Times food critic Michelle Laudig's previous post on Chow Bella, new owner Michael Diamond wanted to open up a neighborhood wine bar and ale house that would cater to the craft/microbrew crowds of today's foodie culture. Did he succeed?

Boyfriend and I were eager to find out, as the aforementioned post boasted over a handful of draught beers and carefully selected wines from all over the world. Diamond previously worked with Phoenix Winebar power-house Postino, so that alone made me feel all giddy inside. After all, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?

After driving over rivers and streams that flooded downtown, we were welcomed into a dark and intimate space that felt almost nothing like its former ghost. I was impressed with the atmosphere and general vibe of the house even before taking my seat at the high bar table and was anxious to see what the menu had in store.

First off, the drink list. While Diamond explained trying to shift the bar towards the craft brew crowd, I was a little disappointed in the eight beers on tap. Now don't get me wrong here, Four Peaks is a top notch brewing company, but doesn't every hipster bar and restaurant boast their very own Four Peaks brew? (See: Delux, the Roosevelt, Stax, and so on.)  While the beers on tap were nothing offensive, I was just a little surprised that there were more Four Peaks brews than anything else. It seemed like too safe of a list.  They did however carry the Sonoran Desert Ale, as well as the IRA by craft beer heavy-hitters Stone. (Personally, I think they should have gone with the IPA). The wine list? GREAT. Upon looking at the wine list, I felt as though I had just run around an open meadow in the Swiss Alps. Finally, another non-Postino run wine bar that didn't have the usual Russian Jack Pinot Noir or Sterling whatever mediocre red is popular this year-all at shockingly affordable prices, only two or three glasses at $10 and all else under that.

Food-wise, Main Ingredient hit the spot for me on such a cold and rainy Phoenix night. I opted for their Griddled Cheese; a grilled cheese sandwich made with muenster, cheddar, Havarti, and local tomatoes on sourdough. Ryan was a little more adventurous and tried their Jive Turkey which was oven-roasted turkey, jalape√±o cream cheese, organic field greens, and local tomatoes on a freshly-baked baguette. Both were under $9, and came with your choice of a field greens salad or kettle chips.

Other fare: Mac n' Cheese ($7) and an assortment of desserts including cheesecakes by the Arizona Cheesecake Company.
Highly recommended.",2010-01-23 20:55:09

Casey was our server and did a superb job. She asked if this was our first time here (yes), if we were  really hungry (yes), and if we liked milkshakes (yes!)

We each ordered from the build your own burger side menu. We also each got fries. The burgers come with a 'sauce' but for $.75 you can have three, which I used for my fries as well. 

As my photo relates, I got a 1/3 pound Bleu Cheese and bacon burger on a brioche bun. Definitely good choices. I asked for medium-rare and that's how it arrived!  It was juicy, with a perfect amount of tang from the cheese, the salty bacon and spicy sauces (I applied garlic aioli and hot sauce). The bread was soft, toasted and warm. 

The shoestring fries were crisped just right and fluffy inside. The peanut butter, chocolate and marshmallow shake was killer.

HtAroYIFudmz0SxooGUJ2g,QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,2,8,5,5,"For their second location, Off The Strip decided to open...on the strip. Located in/on The Linq Promenade, Off The Strip can be accessed either through the casino or from outside on the promenade walk. If you're looking to get seated for a meal, you'll probably want to make your way over to the entrance closer to the promenade side. The hostess table is setup there and it looks like they use the casino side as more of an exit. Inside the restaurant is much smaller than I expected, and it was really dark, but there seems to be enough seating throughout to accommodate steady traffic. 

We ended up coming here for my wife's birthday and having never been to their other location, I wasn't super familiar with what they offered, but I had them bookmarked for some time and have looked at the menu before. But when we arrived, we were given a menu completely different then what I'd seen online with the other side of it being the old menu that had been crossed out. For her birthday, she wanted a steak and there was none to be found. After asking our server, he said there were ""specials"" available not on the menu, 3 of which were steak dinners and the other a pork chop dinner. All the special menu items were priced at $39.99 and served with one side.

For an appetizer, we started off with some Marinated Olives and the Three Wise Hummus tray. There were 3 types of hummus alongside vegetables, feta cheese and pita bread. Out of the 3, I enjoyed the roasted garlic and kalamata olive hummus best. Both were smooth, creamy and added a different flavor to one of our favorite snacks. But the whole tray overall was pretty small and we had to ask for more pita, making the apps $15 price tag feel a bit heavy. The olives were priced much better at just $8, but about the only thing they seemed marinated in was vinegar and salt. After just a couple olives, I was eating them just to finish the bowl since no one else at the table liked them. 

My dinner choice was the Grilled Mahi Filet priced at $24. It was served over a bed of red quinoa, beans and drizzled with balsamic dressing. For the most part, the dish was okay up until I got about half way through the fish. I realized they hadn't fully deboned the fish after I got stabbed in the cheek. When I find things in my food, I usually stop eating it, but I realize with fish it can be easy to miss bones. But after picking through the other half I had, there were 6+ bones still in there. I can't say I've ever found bones in a mahi mahi at any other restaurant, but if you know the fish, they have big long bones. After finding that many, I was done and pretty surprised the kitchen could overlook something like that. 

The service we had was decent, mostly attentive, but we had to ask for refills and simple things a few different times. And when we informed them of the bones in the fish, no one bothered to even offer an apology.  

Luckily, the wife had much better luck with her steak and enjoyed her meal. But even with them being on the strip, I can't see the prices being worth it for the quality of food. Being that the other location has gotten such great reviews for quite a while, I might check that one out, but I'll be staying away from the Linq location.",2015-03-11 03:58:17

My daughter ordered the spring rolls and I ordered the summer rolls to start, which provides me with my only criticisms from my visit.  It took more than 10 minutes to bring out our rolls -- and in fact, my daughter's fried spring rolls came out BEFORE my raw summer rolls!  I'm not sure if they had to drive to the nearest body of water to catch the shrimp in my rolls or what, but it took waaaaaay too long to bring out some simple rolls.  The summer rolls themselves were just okay, not as good as Maxim or Sekong by Night.

Considering the location in a high-end area and surrounding competition I kinda expected better. The menu is your typical T-Mac stuff. Lots of bar-food including wings of course. There are several taco choices and since it's in the name you'd expect them to be pretty good. I wouldn't tout them though. For the same price I'd rather do Cabo Fish Taco or Krazy Fish here in Charlotte.

They have a crap-load of beer options but beware of the attempts by the big beer companies to win your patronage through their far less worthy ""crafty"" options. The bar here is also, likewise, huge. It spans the length of one entire side of the restaurant. Prices are what you'd expect from similar restaurants like Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chili's, etc.

My last visit here was on a weekday night when there was no game going on. Naturally they were dead. Similarly, the staff was pretty useless for lack of a better word. Slow to check on us or come back after a wait to take our order. And slow on refills.

The shrimp was delicious. Spicy and flavorful. A great dish. 4 stars. The side of hummus was actually a full appetizer version, and at full appetizer cost. It was quite meh. And the bread wasn't particularly good either. 2 stars.

The service was kinda meh too. I appreciated their willingness to work with our large group. However, it was a rather long wait to get seated - even though the restaurant was almost entirely empty. And our assigned server seemed particularly unable to handle a large group. Each time he took an order, he took it from just one side of the table, went away, and then returned about 10 minutes later to take the other sides. We were a group of 12, not 25 - so that seemed entirely unnecessary. And, of course, it resulted in our food arriving at drastically different times.

The building itself is relatively new and the space is kept clean, so kudos for that. There is also an outdoor seating  area which is nice when the sun isn't melting the asphalt.

There is good, bad and ugly about this place, so it that order:

Good:
The cheese steaks are really well done. I had the onions and peppers (substituted green for red which I prefer) and the sandwich was really, really good. 

They have an awesome Bloody Mary Bar on Sunday, with a combination of mixes, fruits and veggies. The smartly keep the bacon behind the bar, but it is available. Additionally, the had three different Mimosa mixes out, in case you want to go that route, including a Mango option.

Their pizzas are good, but tend to be on the under cooked side. Their dough is nice, but the sauce could use some pep.

Their fried Mozzarella app is delicious and unique in that it is a slab and not sticks or nuggets. The marinara is a tad on the bland side though.

Bad:
No sides come with any of their sandwiches. The only side on the menu that one would normally consider with a sandwich are battered fries. I dislike battered fries...fries are best au natural. No onion rings, chips etc...

Their meatball hoagie is another hit and miss. The meatballs are good, but the sauce trends bland and they don't put enough on it, so the sandwich is dry feeling.

The tomato cream sauce on their tortellini dish has a fishy undertone (maybe anchovy?) which I did not care for at all. If there is no anchovy in it, then I don't know where that note comes from.

No giardineira. These sandwiches just scream for that.

Because they serve breakfast until 1 PM on the weekends and the eggs are cooked on the same grill as the cheese steaks, no cheese steaks or pastrami sandwiches until after 1. So, for most people, no cheese steak for lunch on the weekends here.

Ugly:

An open kitchen is nice, until you see the cook swiping his cell phone with his gloved hands. Defeats the purpose of the gloves and I don't want to know what could be lurking on his screen. I just hope our food was already cooked.",2017-07-10 15:06:19

The salad was a salad, nothing special.  The baked potato was fine and they gave me enough sour cream when I asked for extra.  For the main dish, the fish was nice, the bay scallops were quite good, and the shrimp were also quite good.  I didn't care much for the clam strips, they were overcooked, dry, and tough.  Our server was efficient and we never felt we needed to ask for anything before he was there to take care of us.

All in all, I would go back as I love seafood and it is hard to find decent seafood here.  I grew up on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico so I miss having good, fresh seafood readily available.",2016-01-21 01:34:26

Vietnam Grille has become, probably, the most frequent place I eat.  Probably the same for my daughter, as well.  She even took my ex there, and I have to admit I felt a little betrayed by that.

I've started exploring more of the menu, and have loved everything.  The service is great; the family who run the place are friendly and warm, and seem to have remembered us from our first visit.

Even the iced tea is great.  I drink mine unsweetened with lemon (or in this case, lime), so the flavor is very important.  Theirs is excellent... I believe oolong black tea.

They have a ""signature sauce"" they serve with many dishes.  When you taste it on the tip of your finger, it seems to have no flavor, but when added to your dish, it seems to somehow magically enhance the flavor.  I understand it is some sort of mirin / fish sauce concoction, but it doesn't taste, to me, like fish sauce (thankfully).

Especially this hot summer, the cool and flavorful bun dishes have been wonderful.  I'll probably try the pho again when autumn rolls back around.",2010-09-01 21:57:13

The decor is unique and cute. I like the upside down tea cup lighting and the Eifel Tower in the background. The place is clean and well kept.

Service can be slow depending on time of the day. Definitely something that can be improved. Especially when we asked for recommendation or special of the day, they seem so clueless. 

Food variety is a plus. They have snacks, entrees and plenty of desert items. We tried Takoyaki this time and we liked it. It was not oily and loved the sauce. We finished it in no time. We also ordered rose milk tea and sea salt grape oolong tea with boba. We customized our drink and asked for half sweet; both drinks were delicious and refreshing. The boba were also soft and not too sweet. The pork belly rice were a 5 stars! Must try! Tasty, juicy and well marinated. 

Price is moderate. Drinks are on the expensive side but food are reasonable. At the end of the day, we spent $39 for an appetizer, 2 rice entrees and 2 drinks. 

It's awesome that they have lunch and daily specials, will have to come back again and agaim for that! On top of my list is to try out their Green Tea Crepe Cake! Yummm",2017-09-25 05:04:04

Entering at first, I thought this particular location was very small. But it was deceptive. The place turned out to be bigger. There is alot of walls separating the various sections of the place.
I'm glad to say the food and service was good. Eating with my family, there's usually a few quirks in our ordering. Everything went smoothly. Checked upon often and drinks refilled.
It is worth noting they brought back their unlimited wings & fries weekday lunch special for $12.99 for a limited time(Was $11.99 when they last had it year). Their Wing Tuesdays & Boneless Thursdays are now both $0.60/wing. Boneless used to be $0.60 and on Tuesday traditional bone-in $0.45 but they raised the bone-in to match the boneless price. Inflation must be hitting this place pretty hard. Wing Tuesday has gone up from $0.25 to $0.60 since I've lived here in 2006.

A few friends hyped it up and said it tasted pretty good. Other than Pho and ramen joints, I've never tried ""Chinese style"" noodle soup dishes. We came by (party of 11) around 1130 on Sunday afternoon and it wasn't that busy yet as it opened at 11. We had a big party so we took the biggest circle table at the back end and there was still enough room for probably 2 more people. 

What we ordered:
1102 - hand pulled ramen w/ braised beef in soup $8.5
1107 - hand pulled ramen w/ hot & sour sauce + pork $8.50
1702 - beef skewer with special seasoning $5.99

Not your typical ""ramen"" the noodles are made in house and they tasted fresh. Other than fresh noodles, the dish was alright. There are two types of noodles. Ramen which is a little thicker than your typical Japanese ramen and sliced noodles which is like ho fun noodles. 

1102 and 1107 were indicated as spicy but there was 0 spice at all. There were sauces on the table and we put chill oil in it to add some flavour to it.. helped a bit. 
1107 soup tasted pretty good but there was way too much vegetables in it (carrots, potatoes, and tomato) and eating that itself got me pretty full. The portions of noodles they gave was a lot so that's a good thing. There was very little pork pieces in the dish.. majority of them were fatty pieces. 
1102 tasted bland. The dishes look like something I could make at home. 
1702 was good. Tasted very Malaysian. I probably liked this the most out of them all.

gin, cointreau, elderflower liquor, fresh squeezed lemon & absinthe, but I was worried about the absinthe. I have had it before and I am not too keen on the flavor. My server assured me that it was very mild and he was right. It was tasty, but I must say it was ridiculously small. My husband even made a comment about the glasses being kiddie cups. My husband ordered the NEW YORK SOUR-
bourbon, sugar, egg white, freshly squeezed lemons, red wine float. He enjoyed it and again tiny and 15.00! I don't mind paying for a good drink, but if it's gone after 3 sips, it's not worth it. That was the only real disappointing part of my meal.

I was excited and had been for a while after seeing the menu on line, not to mention the pictures on Yelp, about having that roasted bone marrow with oxtail jam! It did not disappoint. So sinfully delicious! I suggest you share and eat the bone marrow part of the dish while its hot. As it cools, reality sets in. The fat hardens and you are reminded with each spoonful of what your eating and you can almost feel your arteries clogging.

My husband ordered the Handmade Charcuterie and he absolutely loved it! He was going uncontrollably back and forth between my oxtail jam and his meat and pate feast! The only negative for him was that he does not like star anise, and it seems they must use it to braise their oxtail. Still, he found it all incredible. 

For my entree, I ordered the mussels. I had always thought that I didn't like mussels, but recently had a dish that contained mussels and I loved it. Sadly, at Comme Ca, it was not for me. I really can't point out why. It wasn't bad and my husband really enjoyed it. Something was not right for me. Who knows, maybe it was the bone marrow settling on my tongue, I really can't say. My husband thought the mussels were perfectly cooked and very fresh tasting.

My husband ordered the short rib and it was perfection. I made him trade plates with me. I was really surprised with the decent portion sizes as well. We were able to share and it was more than enough food.

 I like the fact that they have daily specials on the menu, it sort of gives it a down to earth feel with an upscale venue and upscale food. I did enjoy their presentation of their dishes as well. I recommend giving them a try, just don't expect to get any kind of buzz from the miniature cocktails they serve.( The only pretentious part of this place)  Get a beer or a good scotch on the rocks.",2013-03-04 04:49:03
gshfZjyNZJnE0ZaZCHGy1A,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,bG-JFEQjr0pAcgdz7eHkZw,5,2,0,0,"I love a good cup of frozen yogurt.  So far Yogurtland is my favorite chain to visit!  This one is pretty close to my house too, so it makes it even more tempting.  

What draws me into a place like Yogurtland is it's layout and decor.  I love the modern style of most of the Yogurtland interiors, it's kinda like an IKEA!  I love the straight lines, the use of dark wood, the colors.  Yes, to some folks this kind of design in BLAH and BLEH and boring but I love clean.  I am a clean and near-clutter free FREAK.  So I like the minimalism and the organization.  Planning is good!

We go here at least once a month.  Myself, I'm more into the yogurt flavors themselves and checking out what Yogurtland has to offer on a monthly basis.  My kids however?  More into the toppings.  Little itty bitty amounts of yogurt, and lots of toppings!  This is what can make your damn cup of frozen yogurt so expensive!  And at the current 35 cents an ounce it can be quite the price for that cup.  Last time, my little one got like 3 tiny hills of yogurt and topped it mochi balls, almonds, gummy worms, cheesecake, and God knows what else...and it ended up costing me $7!  Yeah, watch your kids!

I actually like the yogurt and want to try most flavors on every occasion.  But I always stick to my faves:  Taro, Plain Tart, and Coconut.  Yep, you guessed it, I'm Asian!  The only gripe I have sometimes is that Taro is not always in stock with the yogurt machines.  It should be a C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T and never, ever rotated out!  It's kinda what defines Yogurtland as being an Asian-founded frozen yogurt shop!  As for toppings I kinda go light, but I do love the fresh fruit:  strawberries, mango, lychee, pineapple, and blueberries often end up at the party.  Yogurtland froyo makes a yum-yum in my tum-tum.

This newer place seems to always be busy - it is after all located in the same area as a Rubio's, Five Guys, and Firehouse Subs.  It's like a one-stop-shop for eats!  Yogurtland is situated right in the middle so it definitely capitalizes in some after meal dessert.  I can only suspect that Yogurtland will get busier as the good ol' Las Vegas summer heat rolls around.

I've heard of Brookwood prior to coming to CLT for my short layover. Somehow I expected this typical food court style restaurant to taste and feel like a university dining hall. While they were able to definitely quell my BBQ cravings, I left feeling like I wanted more.

More sauce? More meat? Perhaps a bit of both.

I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich which comes with a decent amount of meat tucked in between two buns, which weren't toasted. You have a choice of two sides so I opted for the cole slaw and mac n' cheese. They also throw in a fried pickle which was an added bonus.

For $10, I would rate this airport BBQ better than expected, but still lacking some of that genuine BBQ punch I was hoping for. The bread used for my buns was very stale so I ignored that entirely.

The service was not up to what you would consider 5 star as it was incredibly slow (our server was pleasant) in spite of few customers. 

I requested fries instead of home fries to go with my breakfast order. The response... fries cannot be ordered before lunchtime. Really? Wow, unbelievable. Also, three of our party had coffee which was not good at all. My iced tea tasted stale even though our server stated she'd brewed it herself before opening for business. 

Other than the slimy friut medley, the food our party ordered (omelet, eggs over easy, home fries, bacon, sausage & toast) was all right. The pancakes were actually very good and were the highlight of our breakfast experience. 

 Based on this visit, we will not  repeat a visit to this establishment for breakfast. Many other superior establishments for breakfast available here in Mesa and the rest of the valley. Totally disappointed with this breakfast experience. Maybe the service for lunch & dinner is better. I see others have had more positive experiences.

This definitely isn't my preferred pizza style, but it had sooo much flavor to it.  The dough was light and airy and the red sauce was very flavorful.  I talked to the owner a little bit and she was very nice, as were her employees.  

The place is very small, basically just a kitchen and some tables inside 7th Street Public Market (the old Reid's).  I hope they do okay here because local food is good.

I have to admit I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews I saw, but I definitely walked away fairly impressed. 

When the first few of us to arrive walked in, we asked for a table for 10 and then proceeded to head up to the restrooms. This was the best decision we could have made for the following reasons:
a) We discovered the mirrored hallway and pink walls. 
b) We also discovered the sexiest bathrooms alive.
3) I would've never known about the swanky reclining booth seating upstairs that was set away from everything else. 

Upon heading downstairs I inquired about the upstairs. I was told it was usually saved for when the downstairs was full, but upon stating it was my birthday party, we were kindly allowed upstairs. We ended up having enough people for 2-3 booths so this was great.

The waiter started out great at first. Refilling water and being patient on the rest of our crowd to arrive. When we all got the point where it was time to order, things started getting confusing and the service started becoming very slow. I received the wrong pizza. I was able to finally get the right one after a little discussion and time, but by the time that happened I had been munching on other things and it was also close to when we were leaving so I had to box it all. Good part? It still tasted delicious for dinner tonight. When the time to get our checks came it got insanely confusing and several people had the wrong items on their checks and had to get a new check printed several times. 

The food menu is limited and the service is slow, so I'm not sure I'd return here for dinner again, but I won't say I will never go back. Their drink menu is AMAZING. I was so excited to see such a great list of champagne cocktails and other items. The place is also insanely sexy. I love the lighting, the music, the seating, and the history of the building.

On my epic quest in search of Pittsburgh's best pizza, much like The Legend of Kung-Fu before me, my path has brought me to Spak Brothers.

In the midst of construction alley in Garfield, you'll find Spak in all its pinball glory. I've tried the pizza twice at this location, and it is undoubtedly better with a topping. The plain cheese seemed a little dry, but not a bad pie. Overall, the pizza gives a good deal amount of cheese and a crisp crust that would satisfy most's pizza cravings.

But what's really great about Spak is their sandwich and vegetarian (specifically seitan) creations! My boyfriend is a strict carnivore and buffalo wing connoisseur, but for him to enjoy seitan wings and then ask for seconds definitely means that Spak is on to something.

The environment of this ""cantina"" is distinctive; tucked in the corner of a peruvian arts store, and co-owned by the people who own Pamela's, this place has ""hit"" once, and ""missed"" once.  They do have a very basic menu which doesn't change, but the items on there are those that you can pretty easily make at home.  The daily specials that they have are the ones that are a bit more elaborate, and come with a few sides, such as rice and french bread.

I previously thought that peruvian food was simply chicken and rice.  Although this is still the main two ingredients they use, this restaurant has definitely changed my perspective on how many different ways they can prepare chicken.  The first time I went I got a ""ropa vieja"", which was a very simple meat-only sandwich.  The second time I went I got a chicken dish that was mixed with dried fruits: that was delicious.  However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat.  Unfortunately that didn't make for a great first impression.

what drew me to little nicky's were rumours of a tiny tim's-like mini donut machine. walking through the shop's doors, the donut machine is hard to miss, it's front and centre at the bar and the smell of warm deep-fried dough & sugar hits you right away. couldn't pass up the chance to relive our childhoods of gorging on mini donuts at the CNE, we ordered a half dozen ($2.75) but probably should have ordered a dozen ($4.00).

they tasted like little clouds of doughy heaven and melted in your mouth. also ordered double espressos ($2.62) and i must say it was probably one of the best i've had in the city (other than lit's stumptown hair bender). the creme on top was delicious and the espresso had a very smooth, not-bitter taste.

upon repeat visits, i've grown to love the ambience of the shop and their espresso. little nicky's is open monday to friday 730 to 600 & saturdays 930 to 600.",2011-08-08 12:11:30

I was lucky enough to be invited to my first UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) at Paymons.  Lots of good eats, great conversation, service and atmosphere.  The perfect mix of Greek, Indian, some Italian and I loved that there were a ton of Vegetarian options!

Appetizers:
I had the infamous Athens Fries, which lived up to their reputation.  The spice really added to the fries and the sauce was delish.   I kept trying to figure out what was in the sauce as if I were at a wine tasting.. lol..  never did figure it out, but well worth it!  
The hummus with pesto sauce was bomb.  Adding the pesto sauce probably took away from the healthy factor, but, when in Rome...

Entrees:
I ordered the Chicken Curry (mild) and my other half had the Chicken Tandoori.  The flavors were perfect and not overly spicy.  We were both part of the clean plate club.

Unfortunately, I didn't leave room for dessert.  I highly regretted this when I got home.  Next time, I must indulge.  Mama's Baklava is calling my name.  

As far as drinks, they had a great wine list, a killer margarita and their unsweetened tea was so good, it was almost as if it were sweetened.  As a southerner, I'm not a fan of iced unsweetened tea, but they make it work!  There were also a variety of warm tea to choose from.. Lots of green tea, Mango, Earl Grey, Spiced Chai, etc..etc..  A perfect way to end a meal!

The service was perfect!  We were a large party (around 20 peeps) and I don't think there was a single hiccup.  I was also impressed with how the server was able to effortlessly split about fifteen different tabs.  If only I could remember his name!  Shame on me.

The restaurant also had servers with little carts on wheels that slowly maneuvered through the small paths between tables.

They don't have much chicken inside, more of a type of clear noodle but still tasted great when dipped in the sweet sauce. I would order that again.

First thing walking into the restaurant, what's up with flickering lights? Are we in October hollowing hunted house already?
Don't like hunted restaurant!!

Services still poor, there are NO soup spoons on the table we were sitting at! I asked for it, of course, non came. I had to seek spoons from adjacent table! 

Then as we wait for waiter to get our orders, he expressed they had RUN out of basil for pho noodle soup!!! It is unheard of! Sounds like breakfast restaurant telling me they run of eggs and bacons at 06:00 AM as I just sit down in their restaurant.

Then we were out of cold water, I asked for more water. It only took 10 minutes for the water made it to our table after 8 other tables got their fresh water refilled!?!? WTF!?!?

And If you gave me a choice of whether to come Good Catch or Captain's Boil, I would definitely lean towards Good Catch. The overall experience is more robust and pleasant here with more options to choose from. The fact that it's located in such a great location doesn't hurt either!

First impressions is the gigantic space here with big screen TVs all around. The interior is clean and spacious. There's cutlery, plates, glass cups, and this awesome custom tissue box that looks like shipping container. 

Coming with a larger group we were able to sample many things such as the good catch slaw, oyster sliders, etc. The good catch slaw was enjoyable and complimented the meal well but I'm not sure if it was worth the $20 it was. The oyster sliders were also very enjoyable and I liked how they had mini fried onion rings in there. Portion size could have been upped a bit for not only the slaw but also the fries. I really liked how they had a lot of other items besides seafood boils and I'll definitely be back to try things like their soft shell crab and lobster items!

There's not much to say about the seafood itself. The quality was great and we stuck to the mussels, clams, and shrimp. My favourite sauces here were the curry and Szechuan sauces. They were unique and flavourful. The Louisiana spice blend is too plain and too repetitive for me, though that's the same experience I had at other boils.

This is a casual family friendly restaurant that offers Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. They have indoor seating with a bar and also offer patio seating that is dog friendly.

My review is only based on one visit were it happened to be restaurant week.

The parking lot was full but we were able to find a spot on the street not too far away.

We entered the restaurant and one person was in front of us. He said he is with a group of EIGHTY PEOPLE. When the hostess gets to us she says the restaurant is full so we have to sit on the patio. It happened to be very hot today so I said that would be ok but only if I could be sat in the shade. She found a shaded table and it wasn't too bad.

We were greeted by a perky friendly server. She took our order and things got going.

We started with the Greek Salad off the Restaurant Week Menu. It wasn't what I was expecting but it really was good. Chunks of fresh cool watermelon with a little cucumber, onion and olives in a tasty dressing. What's not to like?

Then we get our Sandwich Platters.

I got the Fish Po Boy. I received a Tempura Battered Piece of mild white fish. The sandwich was filled with tomatoes, crisp citrus slaw and topped with a remoulade dressing. All the components of the sandwich were GOOD especially the Delicious Tasty Hoagie Roll....(I'm now sorry I didn't ask if they made it or where they purchased it from).......The problem was that the roll was so big it was impossible to eat this sandwich as a sandwich. It's also way too much bread to eat a battered protein. I think someone in management should try to eat this sandwich so they can know first hand what I mean. I had to eat the fish with a knife and fork. I think this sandwich would be far more successful as in some sort of open wrap or soft taco. The Fries were also very good. They seemed like they were hand cut and were a generous portion. The fries also stayed piping hot.

My husband had the Cobb Burger. It looked beautiful..But my husband said the meat patty was dry and lacked juice. We don't know if the juice got squished out from cooking or if the meat was just packed too tight. 

Both desserts were very good. We both had Ice Cream Sandwiches. They also were very generous in size. They were both made with detailed fresh baked cookies that contained chips and drizzle and both had a THICK Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Center. 

Service was friendly and efficient. Our server even offered refills without us asking for them.

I did have to struggle with the rating here. With just a small amount of tweaking this certainly would be FOUR Stars to me. 

I think the Yelp Average is accurate here......3.5 Stars.",2018-05-22 12:23:32

Got Top Notch to go for the Super Bowl at home.  It now occupies the space formerly held by Monstah Lobstah, which is the restaurant portion of the Doc Holliday's bar on the corner of Serene and Eastern.  Top Notch's sit doesn't make that clear, but the entrance is at Doc Holliday's.

My wife had chicken with green beans and baked beans.  I got the sampler platter, which I did not realize when ordering, but it's ENORMOUS.  4 meats:  ribs, chicken, hot links, and pulled pork.  Comes with 2 sides and 4 half slices (so 2 large slices) of texas toast.  This meal is easily enough for 2 people, and probably 3.  So, don't balk at the price (it's about $23 as I recall).  Well worth it, and you'll have leftovers for sure...

First thing, the texas toast has excellent garlic butter on it.  Not your typical toast.  I usually don't care for texas toast, as I find it too think and bready, but this had excellent flavor.  The ribs were the star meat-wise.  They had a nice smoke ring, good amount of rub, and were tender but not so tender they couldn't stay on the bone.  This is not as easy to achieve as many think.  The hot links were standard, I could have used more heat and I also like them crispier.  I'll ask that they stay on the grill longer next time I come.  The chicken was the worst of the 4 meats for me, but it was fine.  The mac n cheese was a great side, great crust on the top.  The sweet potato casserole is solid, but it's a dessert to me.  I'll definitely get it again.  The baked beans were my favorite of the 2 bean sides.  They have large pieces of meat in them and great classic BBQ flavor.  

I found the sauce to be fine, but I asked for hot and was given 4 deals of mild.  So, next time I'll make sure I get the hot sauce.

We'll be back for sure, it was a lot of food.  We will get several meals out of it.  Also, the meat stood up well to reheating in a toaster oven.

I was disappointed to find several items on the menu that were not listed on the website.  These items included mac n cheese, pulled pork, seasoned fries, plus many others.  So, realize this if you are ordering to go and going solely off of the website.  I grabbed a couple of to go menus, so we won't have the issue again.  I was told they will update the website, so I'm hopeful that occurs soon.",2013-02-04 06:29:37

Even on a Tuesday the restaurant was packed so be sure to make reservations if you come.  It has a fun vibe to it and I love the quirky, Mexican-inspired decor.  

It's a tapas place so you order a bunch of dishes for tasting.  We were a group of 7 so our waiter made up a special tasting menu for us.  It consisted of a shrimp ceviche, mango salad, corn bread, quesadillas and chicken and cod tacos.  Everything was really delicious but the standout for me was the cornbread which was so moist and hot.  They also had put jalapenos in it which added a spicy touch to it.  I love spicy food so this was appreciated.  The quesadilla which had oaxaca and mushrooms were also a hit.

The cocktails were a little bit expensive.  The cheapest ones start at $11.  They were a bit weak considering the price but I did enjoy their takes on classics like the mojito.  

The service was great here.  It was speedy and the waiter was very friendly.  He also knew the menu very well so he was able to make some excellent recommendations for us.

       Chef Enzo Febbraro creates classic Italian-American dishes from Italy's freshest ingredients at Allegro at Wynn. Allegro's casual atmosphere is perfect for a pre-show meal or late night supper, open until 6 AM, yes you read it right. So perfect for post clubbing right.

     Well it was CES 2014 trip,so no late night out was allowed, but we managed to come here a few times for late night snacks. 

     Love the red decor, the pasta-like chandelier from the ceiling, such a beautiful space, warm and inviting, surprisingly gorgeous for a casual resto here at Wynn. 

- MEATBALL SLIDERS * Housemade Meatballs, Baked Brioche Bread, Served with French Fries - the bomb, love it.

- MARGHERITA * Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Basil,  it was so thin crust, the cheese was melting nicely, it was so good.

- CALAMARI * Fried Calamari, Italian Green Fried Peppers, Spicy Tomato Sauce - this  sauce is so addictive, this is  1 of the signature and we  LOVE IT.

- PARMESAN POLENTA * Creamy Corn Polenta, Italian Sausage, Parmesan Cheese - this was so creamy, buttery, melt in your mouth goodness, the sausage was delish and I can't describe how perfect this dish was at the late night hour, after CES 2014, after you lost a few hands + 10 at the tables, this just hits the spot.

- BAKED LASAGNA NAPOLETANA* * Sunday Meat Ragu Sauce, Meatballs, Smoked Mozzarella, Pine Nuts - chef Enzo Febbraro's signature dish... Now this is why I work out and run :-) it's totally worth it, PLEASE order this dish.

       Allegro also offers many dishes for vegan and vegetarian, it's such a great spot for quick bite, quality food, relatively cheaper than all the restaurants here at Wynn and Encore, open till 6 AM. Jackpot! 

       The wine list by the glass was surprisingly reasonable, old and new world.         We were at the bar and our bartender was KAOU, she's from Hawaii. She was so awesome and gracious with our louder than life group, OK, just me with my big lung :-) 

       Chef Enzo Febbraro was in and out of the kitchen greeting his diners. He's so personable, kind, and has the biggest smile and hug. He was lovely enough to explain to us about his food and ingredients, made our visits were much more enjoyable. My team loved every visit here.

The pancakes were awesome. They were drizzled with lemon sauce which I love because blueberry and lemon flavors go so well together! The portion was just enough. I felt satisfied but not overly full.

We stopped in at around 5:30, after I baked in the sun staying in line for Summer Pops at Symphony Park so that I could put our blanket down. It worked out perfectly (in my opinion), so for those who are planning to go to Summer Pops this month, consider putting down blanket and head to dinner. It's inhumane to make any one person to sit out there in the sun for 3 hours. I cannot imagine it to be any fun or at all enjoyable even with bottles of wine.

The only disadvantage is that bar area seatings are all backless high stools, not the most comfortable but it's not bad. The bartender was also our server, which they may need to reconsider that. The bar is long, and the opening is toward the back away from all the tables. That means the poor lady has to walk AROUND the bar every time she's trying to reach any of her tables.

Food was solid. I have always enjoyed the food at Rooster's. We ended up ordering an array of dishes to share. We had 2 things off the bar bites chalkboard: chicken pot pie ($8) & the pork rillettes served on toasts ($6). The pot pie which was super cute in presentation and tasted great. It looked like a treasure box which was made of a nice flaky crust. The pork rillettes was ok... the apple butter was a little overpowering. From the dinner menu I ordered sea scallops ($18), gnocchi ($12) and mussels ($9). 4 sea scallops came in an order, and while it was seared cripsy on top, it was a little over seasoned. I enjoyed it still, especially the pea puree they were served on. Gnocchi was light and fluffy, and cooked in a duck sugo sauce. So if you are not into liver, you probably need to skip this. Mussels were good, about 18 in an order, and came with a big piece of toast to soak up the sauce. We ended the meal with the bourbon cream pudding ($8). We were a little disappointed they're out of the coconut cake... but the pudding was a good alternative. 

Overall it was a great meal. My parents enjoyed it, the open kitchen kept them entertained. It's a nice quiant setting, which I prefer over all the crazy large restaurants in the area. Now if management can figure out the bar area service assignment, I can then relax for the bartender.",2014-06-16 20:02:25

The atmosphere was a-ok. I actually like the traditional formal-style Thai dining tables, although a lot of people complain about the awkwardness of it. Distrurbing kelly green wall with faux-finish really ruined the ambience.

Service was reasonable. Quick, not overbearing. I had multiple questions about things that were not on their menu (roti, other desserts) and the owner came over to the table to chat. 

Food was... alright. But not good enough. They market themself as Isaan-style food, which I personally know quite a bit about. They were heavy-handed on the fish sauce and light on spice. Anyone who knows Isaan will tell you that if you ask for it hot, expect to be nauseated by the spicyness. I asked for Thai-hot on my curry and tom yum goong; the curry was not even remotely spicy and the soup was slightly spicy. I am disappointed! 

Drinks were alright. PRICY beers... my god. I paid $4.50 for a Singha bottle :( Thai iced tea was great. 

Not worthy of the Isaan designation. Maybe if you're desperate like I was, you'll have a one-night-stand but eventually go back to a place that is more delicious, less expensive and generally more worthwhile.",2011-10-04 17:50:30

The third and final day of the 2015 Life is Beautiful was my first time here. I wasn't going to go at all and hadn't even thought about the possibility until my friend shared a relatively good offer that he had found for VIP wristbands. I decided that it would be a fun, unique experience at the least. However, I didn't expect that I'd end up considering it an incredible value.

Most of my highlights and memories from today will be the music. I mostly stayed near the Downtown Stage, which I would consider as the main stage. The Green started off with a decent reggae set. Saint Motel sounded great and delivered a great performance of their most well-known song ""My Type."" Walk The Moon had one of the day's best sets. They were energetic and definitely gave their ""older"" fans (note: they've only had two major albums) something to cheer about by closing with their first single ""Anna Sun.""

After night fell, Brandon Flowers took the stage and delivered strongly on his hits as well as his lesser-known solo songs. It was all going smoothly until he seemingly had a ""keyboard issue"" in the middle of his set and had to have it replaced. Strangely, his band and backup singers had filed off the stage. When the new keyboard was put in place and revealed, everyone saw the ""k"" on it and cheered because they knew what was coming: a series of a certain local band's famous songs starting with ""Mr. Brightside"" and ending with ""When You Were Young,"" although that mini-set was notably missing ""Somebody Told Me.""

Weezer was my last hurrah at the Downtown Stage. They played pretty much all of their hits as well as their new single ""Go Away,"" which features Bethany Cosentino. Coincidentally, she was there performing with her own group Best Coast earlier, so of course they brought her on stage for that duet-of-sorts. Their set even had an encore with their highest-charting single ""Beverly Hills"" and their classic ""Buddy Holly,"" both of which I had been eagerly awaiting the whole time. After Weezer concluded their performance, it seems that almost everybody, myself included, headed over to the Ambassador Stage on the opposite side of the venue for Death Cab For Cutie. I had to cut my viewing of that band short because my friends were leaving, but I heard several of their notable songs. They were pretty solid, but they didn't seem especially inspired in my opinion.

Food is a big thing here. However, it seems that all of the food for sale is pretty overpriced, and the menus of even the interesting names are limited to mass-appeal products, like the burger from Fleur (by Hubert Keller) and the lobster roll and hot dog at RM Seafood / Rx Boiler Room. If I want overpriced restaurants or food trucks, I'll go to the Strip or the Great American Foodie Fest, respectively. Also, it seems that they've attracted a lot fewer non-Vegas chefs this year, which lessens the feel of exclusivity even more.

Fortunately, VIP access meant that I could head over to the cooking demonstrations and score free samples, all of which were delicious. Adam Sobel, a chef with ties to Vegas and a current position leading Michael Mina's test kitchen in San Francisco, prepared a za'atar cured salmon flatbread despite his vegan heritage. Steve Samson, who had a brief stint as a Vegas sous chef before eventually opening Sotto in LA, demonstrated a sous vide lamb with arugula and a pecorino not-Romano. Finally, Carla Pellegrino showed us a boiled octopus that she eventually served with potatoes, fava beans, and pesto. I should note that there was one cocktail demo by Eric Hay of Wirtz Beverage where we didn't have the opportunity to sample anything. Fiddlesticks.

I did pay attention to some of the art in passing. There's a lot to find if you're really into that kind of thing, and I was most surprised to see Snoopy and Hello Kitty with parts of their skeletons revealed. As for the speaker events, I didn't attend any of those although it seems that I would had a huge scheduling conflict with the only speaker I would have cared about on Day 1, if I had been able to go.

We're down to the finer details now. I appreciated and often utilized the charging stations in the VIP area, although I should have brought my own chargers and/or battery packs because the provided cables were slow. The water stations were reasonably convenient, but because they didn't have any water stations directly inside the VIP areas, I did a lot of walking and RFID scanning today in spite of keeping close to one stage. Weather was hot, but that's not truly within the organizers' control. Finally, I'm sure parking isn't the easiest situation for this kind of huge event in this part of town, but we found a legit and inexpensive spot relatively nearby.

I'm hearing rumors that Life is Beautiful may have ended its run. If so, this was a great last day, and I have no regrets about going. Hopefully, they'll be back and better.",2015-09-28 09:52:36

Imagine you're Marty McFly and you just got zapped back to 1955; well that's the vibe this place has as soon as you walk in. Black and white checkerboard floors, red leather bound booths and chairs with multiple old school movie posters on the walls. ""This is getting heavy doc.""

This place is very tiny with only two booths and a few chairs, so you better not come here during the lunch rush or you're eating in your car. If you're on the run and need a bite, Coo Coo Cafe does offer phone-in orders that you can pick-up on the way to you're next appointment or if you wan to eat at home while you enjoy reruns on TV. ""What's a rerun?""

With plenty of parking outside, I pulled up, walked in and met the owner, who by the way also takes your food order. This dude has a salty demeanor, but I can tell he's the ""big soft teddy bear"" type. No messing around though, just order your food and sit down...cool with me I'm starving! I went with what he said was the, ""local favorite"" the Cali Sub w/ sprouts, avocado, turkey, bacon and swiss cheese. On paper this sounds pretty basic, but it was very fresh and piled high (see photo) with lots of goodies, plus the bread was super soft. Plush in the middle and toasted on top by a sandwich press. Let's be real, the bread can make or break a good sammie, right?!?! 
""That's right butt head""

To wash it all down I ordered the ""Kiwi Kooler"" smoothie. This had a great presentation, but was a little on the sweet side for my taste so I only drank about half. All-in-all this place was a hit for me and my tastebuds. 
""Great Scott!""

When you walk in you can smell the burning wood and the place is clean and spacious with lots of seating.  
The man at the counter was very helpful, he let us know the popular items, let us know that the arepa looked tiny but they are very filling. Each arepa on the menu is around 5-7 bucks depending on what's inside it. You can add extra toppings like cheese, fried egg, and avocado for .50 - $1.00. 

We ordered one shredded chicken one beef with plantains and beans. Came out to around $12. Sure enough when we picked them up they were really hefty. Check out the photos! The arepa itself was nice and crunchy on the outside but was really soft and kind of crumbly on the inside. Overall had a great mouthful and paired perfectly with the well seasoned meat. It almost reminded me of a gigantic tamale but 10,000 times better. They also serve them with a side of green hot sauce and garlic cilantro mayo, both of which I recommend. 
They also give you a bunch of napkins, and you're going to need all of them because things get REALLY messy really quickly. Next time I might use a fork and knife just to help me tackle all of the meat.

-Amazing karaoke. I had to turn around and second guess that a real person was singing Miranda Lambert, and it was not just a recording. We're talking talent that's almost an American Idol level. Wow. They didn't just do country...some guy was screaming into the mic on an emo track and patrons thought it was groovy. I like. I like a lot. 

-Hard liquor. Hard liquor everywhere. This is the kind of place where manly men can show off and shoot ""moonshine"" all night. It didn't even break the bank. 3 beers and a Jack & Coke was less than $20 before tip.

-Space. Lots and lots of space to sit or stand. Patio was tiny, but if you need fresh air, it's not like it's far out of your way. 

Not to say this place was perfect. This is the only bar in Westgate that does not carry beers on tap. Whichever beers that have in stock is also not made clear, and you won't really be able to ask over the blaring music, so just get a Budweiser or something. And finally, they were pretty gosh darn slow, as if the workers still didn't know where everything was. Is it that new? In any case, I had a good time and would love bringing back some friends.

Custard Tarts - Was not overly sweet and the crust was nice and flaky.  Custard was also perfectly cooked.  Perfect thing to have if you want something quick and light. 5/5

Curant Cheesecake - Nice and creamy. What I think I like most about the crust was that it was a little cakey. Also had a nice toasted flavour to it. If all their cheesecakes are like this, I would definitely try the rest. 5/5

Caramel Crunch Cake - You can get a personal sized one! Perfect for when you want some and don't want to share, lol.  A little on the sweet side, though.  4/5.

Veal Sandwich - I was expecting this to be a little on the ""tough"" size but it was perfection.  Simple yet so much flavour.  This was probably the highlight of my trip and could honestly see myself driving all the way from Scarborough for it. 5/5

Pepperoni Pizza - Was expecting to be blown away with their pizza but I was pretty disappointed.  On the plus side, they're generous with their pepperoni. 2/5.",2017-04-24 15:33:55

They have the d√©cor theme for sports/Corona etc. Our both we sat in was ok I felt I was sitting on the floor because the table hit me just at my chest area :) I think they need to be restuffed. The waiter brought us out 2 corn jalapenos muffins just out of the oven not bad and my husband was surprised he was able to eat it because he hates spicey/hot  food!! 
I ordered the cheese quesadilla with chicken. It came to me cut up in 5 slices with guacamole, sour cream and pico on the side. Great presentation and it tasted wonderful.
My husband ordered a plate that had chicken/rice burrito with chips he also got sides of pico and guacamole. He said it was fantastic. 
During our meal the waiter was interactive with us and even told us to save room for desert! But we were so full afterwards we had to skip desert.

I came here for industry night which offers 50% off the whole menu to business people in a variety of industries. It's a great way to give people in the industry who live near the strip a reason to venture out to the Red Rock area. 

When I walked up to Mercadito I was greeted by Jen the Marketing Manager. She was very personable and helpful. My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar outside because the inside of the restaurant was completely booked until hours later. I told the women working at the bar multiple times that when she had a chance I would like to get started with some appetizers. She took many drink orders from other people before taking my order. I ordered the mango guacamole with chile de arbol to start. It came out quickly and I appreciated seeing a different take on the traditional guacamole. The mango and chipotle went well together. For my main dish I ordered the carne asada plate. The epazote paired with the oregano gave the skirt steak a strong and salty flavor. Under the steak was a watercress-jicama slaw. The biter tang of the watercress and sweetness of the jicama slightly counterbalanced the saltiness of the steak but it was not enough.

I met the guy who runs the place at a networking event and he gave me a handful of free beverage cards.  Of course I used them to check the place out and was very impressed with the good service and good coffee.

I visited recently for the first time as a paying customer and I was twice as impressed.  I asked the barista if they had iced tea.  They only have Yerba Mate, which is not really my fave, but I was willing to try again.  They have a ton of flavors and can make it for you or they have it for sale in bottles.  I chose the freshly brewed chai flavor.  While I waited for my tea to steep for a minute the barista cashed me out and then said ""Do you want one of the bottles for free just so you can try it?""  I love you Dutch Bros.  And, they revived my faith in Yerba Mate.  The bottled stuff was sweetened but not too much and pretty tasty.  The brewed beverage was much tastier to my buds.

They have a very convenient and quick drive-thru at the corner of Lemon and Rural.  Or you can walk up to the window to order and sit at the outside tables.  They do not have indoor seating.

Spending the afternoon of New Year's Eve in and around Scottsdale as lunch came around I asked my family what they were craving and deciding against Lo Lo's after much debate we ended up at Brat Haus in hopes of finding the artisanal sausage house as good as previous visits to similar locales in Chicago...but unfortunately no such luck would be found.  Clearly a spot where the impressive beer list supersedes the quality of the food our meal started off on the wrong foot when we were denied seating in the main dining room and placed in a smaller back bar area and although the bartender was pleasant enough while a great soundtrack played overhead it became quite obvious early on that our lack of enthusiasm for suds was unappreciated with food arriving slowly, often far from hot while water refills required direct inquiry.

Focusing on the food, a first round of appetizers proved to be fine, if not wowing - the pretzel nothing to write home about and the ""do you want cheese with that"" commanding an unannounced $3 up charge while the dates and pecorino were a nice sweet and savory pairing with quality ingredients well prepared.  Last and perhaps least, a basket of fries was ordered by my aunt and although I'm far from an expert I found them to be a bit undercooked; more starchy and less fluffy than I'd prefer.  

 Moving on to the meat of the menu (pun intended) aside from being luke warm and served on a decent roll I do not understand the reviews for the brats at Brat Haus and, as a matter of fact, with all the ridiculously hefty spices I'd defy anyone to differentiate on blind tasting the difference between pig, duck, or turkey on any of our selections - a lack of subtlety that led to my mother giving up after a few bites and even challenged myself on the duck brat as I felt like I was eating the smell of Penzey's Spices more than anything protein.  Faring better - as a matter of fact quite a bit better - my aunt's burger with a supple and smoky patty, fried egg, and sharp Swiss was the highlight of the savories; a case of ""Keep it Simple, Stupid"" if there ever was one.

For desserts - generally not a beer fan I actually liked what the rich chocolate stout did to temper the sweetness of the dates and the waffle that so many have raved was indeed a light at the end of the tunnel; a light, airy, and golden crisp disc with a bit of spice balanced by the sweet honey showing that the kitchen can indeed achieve balanced boldness when they try - or perhaps when they DON'T try and end up overthinking and overshooting their mark as they did with the sausages.",2013-06-02 01:49:35

Slowest service I've ever encountered for such an event (and I've been to many). Salads arrived about 45 minutes after the program started, and it was almost two hours before the first dinner plate hit the table. When I contacted the manager this was explained away by saying that the presenter requested a 20-minute lag between ordering and preparation (there is a bit of a difference between 20 minutes and almost two hours). Went to another presentation about a week later at another place and we were done with everything (including dessert) in 15 minutes less than it took GB to just bring us our entrees.

T6PPKGtgqTAzALDRl_Gu4Q,IBiHQzvzP01UNuLbADSz4A,G9r4WJwmrNbt75kF3Fnxtw,5,4,4,5,"Located at the corner of Via Linda and Mountain View, The Egg I Am is an unassuming gem!

My daughter and I went for a late brunch today. The restaurant closes at 2:30, so, by the time we got there at 1:45, we pretty much had free reign of the place. We noticed a sign saying that the patio was open for seating, but surprisingly, it was too cold for us to sit there today, as it was completely shaded when we were seated. Instead, we opted to sit by one of the large windows that overlooked Via Linda.

The owner seated us, and gave us each a menu. Now, having a toddler, I'm accustomed to seeing kids menus with crayons to placate the children as they wait for their food. However, The Egg I Am does't use crayons, they use colored pencils. I know that probably doesn't sound very earth shattering, but it was different, and a nice touch. It's nice to see a place try and do things a little differently.

The food itself is fantastic! My daughter ordered off of the children's menu, as everything there is just under $5.00. She opted for the kids' cheeseburger with fresh fruit. I had to do a double take when her plate arrived, because the burger was huge! It was easily 1/4lb. Needless to say, my three-year-old could only finish about a quarter of the burger during our visit. It DID make for nice leftovers, though.

I, trying to maintain some semblance of a healthy diet, opted for the Vera Cruz Chicken and Avocado Omelette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9r4WJwmrNbt75kF3Fnxtw?select=ggmQxiCJgJM41S3nWZuijA#gXr_sj61JYixeVVAZkn_Vw. This is an egg white omelette with diced chicken, tomatoes, onions and green chiles, topped with cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses and fresh avocado, served with a side of fresh fruit and a small bowl of salsa. It is nothing short of spectacular, imho http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9r4WJwmrNbt75kF3Fnxtw?select=ggmQxiCJgJM41S3nWZuijA#FA7aEbJm-oAuPt2xptQ8ww. It's one of those meals, that no matter how large the portions may be, you'll always wish there was just one more bite!

Interesting side note: as we finished up our meals, two ladies sat behind us, and started asking questions about the menu. I happened to overhear that the restaurant makes their soups fresh each and every day.

This is a great place to come for breakfast, lunch, or brunch. One note of caution: be mindful of the hours of operation. The Egg I Am is never open past 2:30 in the afternoon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9r4WJwmrNbt75kF3Fnxtw?select=ggmQxiCJgJM41S3nWZuijA#3PIa9nVtZc5NOcTf2dWcZw.

Gold Spike is a comprehensive hang out. There is drinking, games, and food. The location includes an indoor area as well as a large outdoor area. Inside there is a large bar, the food area, Connect Four, Foosball, darts, and pool tables. Outside was where most of the games were located. There were several cornhole boards, beer pong, giant beer pong, Four Square, Twister, tetherball, and giant Jengas. They definitely carry a variety of games to appeal to a variety of people. 

Obviously, this is a popular spot so getting use of the games can be challenging, especially the outdoor games. We were able to play a variety of games over the course of the night and without too much of a wait. The only complaint I would have is that several of the games were broken or missing pieces which contributed to wait times on the functional games. Twister had broken glass pieces on it, cornhole boards were missing bags, the giant beer pong was missing a ball, Four Square's ball was missing, and pieces of the foosball table were broken. Nothing is perfect, but it's hard to justify coming for games when so many are broken or missing pieces. I think this place would be a five if they would do a quality check on pieces and functionality of the games each night.

There were two bars, one inside and one outside. The bar inside had little to no wait and was quick. The outside bar was more popular, but the wait times were still reasonable. Drink prices were okay when factoring in that entertainment is provided.",2016-11-14 04:03:08

They are RELENTLESSLY pushy on their up-sell, which is very uncomfortable, and as always talking loudly and rudely in a Vietnamese is always unpleasant.

This is not a relaxing place, We were never offered a drink from their drink case, the woman doing my pedi cut my toe (which hurt) and didn't even apologize, they allowed a client to bring in their toddler while she had services done, and the kid ran around screaming and bothering people the entire time. Unbelievable. 

I chose the regular pedicure, but it honestly felt like their ""Express"" pedicure. Very whatever, just another job, hurry hurry, never once friendly. My toes weren't even close to being dry and we were shooed out the door.

The downstairs level seems kind of drab. 

Our server ""S"" was the friendliest, kickass server one could ever hope for. My wife doesn't like heat in her Mex or meat in her tum. He was very patient and offered her ala carte options to suit her needs. Even informing us of stock in the rice. She ordered the tableside guac preparation(creamy and amazing), 2 cheese enchiladas, and an order of sopes(corn pockets with bean filing). I got the Favorito salad with grilled mahi mahi and a Fourth Street Siesta(Cuervo and peach brandy). The server  chided me about ordering a lame sounding drink. Apparently every place on East 4th has an ""east 4th"" drink. But i was all about the ingredients, not the name. It was decent.

He also saw our catalog of movies and talked film fest with us enthusiastically. Servers always like to chat up my wife. I ended up eating one of the enchiladas. It was very smokey and chewy. That's good, because i hate traditional sloppy and soggy enchiladas. My mahi mahi was tender and buttery. Again, that's good. Now the damage(close eyes as i open the bill)....THIRTY BUCKS? How can this be? I was expecting fifty at least. We left a huge tip, because i could not believe what a fantastic meal we had for that price downtown.

The TVs are individual to the cardio machines, which is great if you want to come in and watch a show or a game.

The juice bar has a lot of choice, albeit one should remember to watch calories because its so much easier to ingest calories than burn them.

I came here yesterday (Thursday) for dinner with my sister and mom.  This is a typical HK diner and I usually expect a quick turn-around for tables.  I waited maybe 10 minutes for a table and got directed to my table.  

In the mornings they have breakfast combos and lunch combos named: ABCDEFGHIJKL etc.  They have both English and Chinese; and honestly if you don't know how to say it to the lady or she doesn't understand you - please just point at the menu and they'll go get your food. Each entree usually comes with a hot drink and cold drinks are $0.50 more.

The food usually comes at lightning speed and they more or less toss it at you (hahaha, no really they slide it onto your table and don't describe it to you: this is your beef brisket with noodles and lettuce.  It's more like: BEEF BRISKET? WHO ORDERED BEEF BRISKET AT THIS TABLE? 
It's all about efficiency.

Okay, so back to my dinner.  They were severely understaffed that day - in the kitchen and in the dining area.  My meal took longer to come than usual ): but it was amazing.  The assorted grilled meat on a sizzling platter is the best to share.  It'll fill you right up for a good deal. 
They're also very accommodating.  My mom's fried chicken leg came out a little bloody and they re-fried it for her.

Waving down a waitress was a little harder to pay.  So my mom just called one of their names & they usually scream back at you from wherever they are and ask you what's going on.

Overall, I'll return here as usual.

I'll still choose Italia for many of my sitting in my community getting caffeinated needs, but Odessa wins on a couple of points - I prefer the eco takeout cups to the styrofoam at Italia (the squeak between my teeth is uber-cringe-y.)

The menu is hefty with choices (as is any hong kong food place), and the food is reasonably priced. 

The menu comes with pretty much anything that's standard with Hong Kong food and it's just super delicious here, with no complaints on the portion size. 

The first time I had came here, I jumped in really quick with the $18.99 Sirloin steak. It comes on a hot plate sitting on top of some delicious french fries, and you can also choose another side to go with it. It comes with a soup also and a drink. The sirloin was a hell of a lot bigger than I had imagined, and in all honesty it's worth the big price tag. Everything about the dish was delicious, down to the fries and the gravy poured upon it.

The second time around, the fiance and I were super hungry and decided to both get a steak and fries choice, but this time being $7.99 (i believe) off the tea menu. And a bowl of your choice of noodles with a bunch of meats. Spam, hot dog, bacon, ham, pork belly you name it! We opted for instant noodles to go with this one. It also comes topped with 2 fried eggs.

The steak and fries were great, but fairly so, the steak wasn't as good as the humongous sirloin steak, but it's nearly half the price so I'm not complaining. The bowl of ramen was good, the soup base I was really so so about and don't really think it's worth raving about. Bu the amount of friggin' meat they put into this bowl made it 100x worth it! The instant noodles did remind me a lot of Mr.Noodle though, which kinda sucked.

Food and drinks come out super fast, which I can only assume it's because there's usually a line out the door so they kinda want to do a fast rotation of customers to limit the queue time.

This place is usually packed with a 15-20 minute waiting time during the lunch hour on weekends. So prepare for a wait. Absolutely worth going here though! This will always be my go to place for delicious Hong Kong food on the go .... Well, until I find something better.",2015-09-28 05:05:29

I ended up purchasing two lip glosses, two lipliners, a lipstick, eyeliner and a shadow compact (Smoke and Mirrors) with 6 colors in it. Altogether it was $150 but I expected that and like another reviewer said...this stuff LASTS. 

What's even cooler is that Jessica (the clerk assisting me) showed me how to put on eyeliner!

-There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original. The Central Brass Company located in Reading, PA refurbished them.
-The Grand Lobby mirrors, marble and woodwork are all original.
-At the landing on each staircase in the Grand Lobby are 18-foot high original mirrors meant to be reminiscent of the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.
-The signature piece of the Benedum Center is the original main chandelier which weighs 4,700 pounds, is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. It was restored in honor of the late H.J. Heinz II. 
-Approximately 95% of the interior of the building is plaster. It took a fifteen person crew almost a full year to complete the plaster renovations.
-There are 1,500 feet of brass rail in the theater, most of which is original. 
-On St. Patrick's Day in 1936, the theater flooded within two feet of the balcony. Several men were trapped for three days until police arrived in a motorboat and rescued them.
-The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was named in honor of the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, which made the largest contribution toward the restoration of the theater.
-The Benedum Center opened on Friday, September 25, 1987, with a show called Purely Pittsburgh. It was written by Dan Langen and produced by Mandy Levine. The show featured composers from Pittsburgh and performers with a Pittsburgh connection.
-In 1928, the Stanley cost $3 million to build. In 1987, the Benedum Center cost $43 million to restore.",2015-05-19 03:39:20

Since we moved here in 2011, we look forward to Spring Training and the regular baseball season.  The Dbacks are usually competitive, but not this season.

The reason they get a bump up in stars since my last review is because the team is a class act and despite a bad year has the team going in the right direction.  They're also very fan friendly and put on some great game day promotions.  My favorite is bring your dog to the game day....it's fun to watch all of the dogs in the ballpark.

First, much of the center has the exact same exhibits (for years) if you have a membership or go there even once a year. The ones that change every so often cost extra $, and for an already-pricey place, you probably should have a membership or get a free pass from the library. Bad thing...with a membership, the emails you get reminding you that the latest exhibit's last weekend is here forgets to also remind you of the extra price involved. The kids do love the first place you come to...a water display with tons of balls. Only lacking seating for parents.

SfxqoKR4-0KE-qi8phh8RQ,sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw,4,1,0,0,"After reading all of the 4 and 5 star reviews, and perusing the photos of seafood mountains, I finally had a chance to dine here during the 4th of July Holiday weekend.  We even arrived at 4:30 PM with hopes to beat the rush, but still waited in line for an 1.5 hours just to get to the cashier, then another 20 minutes before we were seated- but I knew to expect that and my husband and I took turns playing the slots- so it's all good... (plus winning at the slots to pay for dinner was icing on the cake). 

I had been craving snow crabs and was very happy with the selection.   It was not salty at all and I actually prefer the non pre-sliced crab legs.  When I have to work for my food, it tastes even better- plus I am forced to take my time and not just shovel plates of food like a gluttonous pig.  4 out of the 5 snow crab segments that I cracked and peeled, were flawless and perfectly dipped in butter. Only 1 of them stuck to the shells. Not bad...

I also made sure to save enough room for a slice of medium rare prime rib and for a buffet, it was quite tasty.  Of course, I also had to stock up on some cocktail shrimp and something about the cocktail sauce had me wanting more and more.  Unfortunately, because I am pregnant I couldn't partake in the unlimited wine and beer, but who knows if I would take up precious stomach space anyways.  Regardless, our waitress was quite attentive and my class of iced tea was never empty, nor did a dirty plate sit at our table for more than a couple minutes.  

I did try the sushi and nigiri and I'll pass next time.  I did try a couple pieces of the tempura shrimp and veggies and those were delish.  But other than that, I had stuffed myself silly with crab legs and shrimp, that I didn't have a chance to sample much else.  However, the selection is quite vast.  The dessert station looked fabulous and I couldn't leave without a scoop of pistachio gelato.  Yummo!

All in all- a successful buffet trip and one that I look forward to making again, especially when I am not pregnant so that I can partake in the raw oysters!",2011-07-05 19:37:17

The portion sizes of the apps / sides may appear small at first, but are deceivingly filling. They have a variety of drinks (including wine in a can - what an innovation). I tried their spicy coffee - it was a bit heavy on the spice (actual chilli flakes in the drink) so I would opt for something more traditional next time.

Service and atmosphere: I love the bright, airy space and the modern decor - very instagram worthy.

Went in and its a small local pizza shop look. The place smelled good. We sat in front of the cooking area where we could see them cheffing it up.
The menu is simple and wasn't sure what to expect because the place looks less than unassuming.
We ordered a couple pizzas which were fantastic and the toppings looked hand cut. The pie and crust and sauce were cooked perfectly and tasted perfect and  tasted fantastic.
Garlic knots were huge, hot and you really could taste the garlic and light cheese topping with marinara. You gotta try them. We ended up taking some home as we ordered a bunch to try it out.
The calzone was gourmet style and they'll ale it anyway you want.
Salad was fresh topped as you'd get in a very nice restaurant and topped with a great balsamic dressing. Perfect.

They cook was more like a chef that bought a pizza place. The food quality and taste was  one of the best ever for a pizza experience. 

Price was very reasonable for what you get. The cook/chef turned out to be the owner and very personable and friendly.

Got the peppercorn + au gratin + crab cake + mushrooms & blue cheese topped. I was wondering how they'd handle this all and I must say I am quite impressed enough to stop and write an actual review. 

Yes, I've been more than 2x and usually Happy Hour - which is daily, in the bar and patio only. 

Y'all they packaged this Medium Well peppercorn 12oz cut in slices (which next time I'll request not to do) with the blue cheese and mushrooms separated in a ramekin. Crab cakes are like someone from home made them (insert googly eyes) as the crab is THICK and CHUNKY non of that cheap shredded stuff. Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Those boys DID THEIR THING. I debated on trying chicken as I've never had it here and I've had the salmon before and thought about it again but opted for the steak. 

No pictures, y'all. I thought about it but kept going as my greediness kicked in. Boom~ 

I must say, I'd rather have 2 sides because I can't resist the au gratin yet I'd love to try something else. I didn't see an option to add a side but they do allow you to add on soup or salad, lobster tail, crab cake, grilled shrimps..the usual add-on. 

Either way, I like AJ's management style here so yeah I mean to try other places but never get around to making myself go.

With so many items on the menu it was hard to decide on a few things and some items are bound to be underwhelming. The key is knowing just exactly what to get. Stick to the tried and true items. 

The highlight was the salmon tataki, and it seems the raw items are the safest picks here. But otherwise most items were fairly disappointing or just mediocre. I wouldn't exactly recommend the ebi mayo, or okonomiyaki (it's not exactly a pancake). The pressed sushi was okay but the rice was more mushy and vinegary than I expected, and the salmon just did not come through at all. 

The tofu salad was a big portion which was surprising, it was nice to have some greens for your meal.

Sunday October 30th review:
Upon trying to self park the garage had a sign stating please use valet or self park at Fremont Street Experience garage across from Valet entrance. I figure i would unload and let my family get checked in while i go park. So thats what i did. Once i was unloaded at Valet, I asked one of the staff working why the garage was closed and they stated that the garage is under repair for new elevators. Well thats good to know. After I parked over at the Fremont Street garage. Check in went smoothy till i found out that on top of the $20 resort fee that wanted $100 that will be refunded once checked out. Well I did just that and asked about the parking situation. The Lady that got us checked in stamped our pass and said if u leave and come back just bring the new pass back and we will stamp it again. After we got checked in and headed up to the 6th floor room 611. The room was brand new. Bathroom was updated. Beds were updated. Let me tell you this is no Golden Nugget room but it was worth the price of $45 before tax. I would be staying here more often if Golden Nugget has no rooms available or the prices are over $200 this weekend. 

I would had rated this a 5 star hotel but due to the parking situation i lowered the score. 

Pros:
Clean & remodel rooms
Breeze checkin

Cons:

The one thing that I'd have to take points off for is the sauce - too red and thick that it looks unappetizing. In general, all the baked rice dishes are quite heavy.

When I asked if he would be willing to comp me the next time I'm there as it had happened a few times the response was no but that next time I'm in he would make sure I got a fresh item.  Wrote to cobs head office, they emailed claiming they were going to send me a giftcard but nothing came.

I usually go to Pickle Barrel a few times a month to enjoy a nice meal with friends or family and then pick up a jar of the restaurant's famous sandwich pickles on my way out the door from the takeout counter.

Our server was extremely polite and professional and gave us ample time to digest the ever-expanding menu. I swear Pickle Barrel adds an addendum to their menu every week - that thing is getting to be quite a beast and it's sometimes overwhelming to make a decision. There's literally something for everyone - at our table alone we had someone order:
- fruit salad and yogourt
- french toast
- waffles
- szechuan-style steak
- chicken panini

If that's not variety under one roof, I don't know what is. I ordered the thick french toast (really - are you surprised??) with chocolate and bananas and for $8 it was quite a hefty portion. Probably about 4 or 5 full slices of bread, halved. Very, very tasty.

First of all I loved the way the restaurant looked, with the private rooms and authentic furniture.
The servers were all very friendly and always smiling.
The menu wasn't as huge as Song Cooks but they had all the Korean staples. I opted for the MaeMil MakGooksoo (cold buckwheat noodles with cabbage, spicy sauce, and a bit of a slushy broth) and my friend got the soft tofu chigae.
We then were immediately served the bachans, which were 3 dishes consisting of kimchi, beansprouts and pickled onions. When we asked for more we were given even larger portions of the bachans. 
After eating my noodles I determined that I have  found another favourite Korean dish! This meal was incredible and extremely filling. the broth took in all the flavours of the hot sauce and pickled vegetables.
My friend enjoyed the chigae too, which came piping hot with a side of rice.

It was a Monday night at 1:30am. The decor looked like Prince threw up all over the restaurant. Very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. We had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. The hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. After we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. Ummm probably shouldve told us that before. But good thing I had cash which I usually don't. 

Food: how can u mess up chicken fingers and a house salad? For the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. Besides taking forever to get our food. The lettuce in the salad was browning. And the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. I don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. The chicken fingers were so hArd they felt like biting into a brick. And their BBQ sauce tasted like hotsauce and ketchup.

Maybe I should get a pasta next time.  Came here with a group of friends as this was someone's recommendation of their favorite pizza place in summerlin.  Personally I like thin crust new York style pizzas and this place offers both NY and Sicilian style.

We were a pretty big group so had reservations on the beautiful patio outside.  The weather was perfect for dining al Fresca.  We started off with a bunch of appetizers....we might have ordered almost all the menu items.

Arranchini - 2 stars.  I'm not really a fan of this.  Comes with 3 big Arranchini balls in sauce but I thought it lacked flavor

Calamari - 5 stars.  Was really delicious but fried calamari is inherently delicious.

Mediterranean salad - 3. stars.  Wished it had more cucumbers and feta cheese.  Didn't really feel too Mediterranean for me...more like a standard salad.  I did like the dressing though

House salad - 2 stars.  Literally just spring mix with cherry tomatoes.  Nothing special.

Antipasti - 2 stars.  Not a big fan of the meat and cheese selection that came with the platter.  It came with prosciutto and salami but not sure what kind of cheese came with the platter.  I wouldn't order this again.

The special caprese salad with fried mozzarella 1 star.  The mozzarella was fried in a super thick slice so the cheese was still firm on the inside but a crispy fried outer crust.  Fresh mozzarella would have been so much more delicious.  Frying it made it seem like the cheese was hard and stale.  

Meatballs - 3 stars.  Standard

Chicken wings - 3 stars - a little dry and on the small side.  Not as juicy as I hoped it would be.  I did like the bbq and buffalo flavor though.

Special Pizza Sicilian style with pepperoni and basil - 3 stars.  The pizza was good but I didn't feel like it was super special or signature to DeMarco's.  

Mushroom White Truffle Pizza - 0 STARS.
This was actually inedible to me.  DO Not ORDER THIS!!  It sounds delicious but unless you can drink truffle oil straight up, you will not like this.  It looked so wonderful and delicious but I took one bite and felt nauseous.  The truffle oil sucker punches you in the face!  You can't taste anything else.  I only took a bite and took the rest of my slice home.  I tried to eat it the next day and after a bite I had to throw it away.  TOO MUCH truffle oil.  A drizzle is enough!  If you want to try it maybe request the truffle oil on the side and drizzle it yourself.

We were seated right away, the service was amazing, the bread was fresh and tasty, along with the food. There is plenty to be said about this place and I would suggest not coming in wearing shorts and a muay thai tee like me. The prices were fair for what you get as well as the ambiance. I ordered the lasagna, and my wife Fettucine Alfredo with Pancetta and Peas saying she really enjoyed it and it was authentic tasting. I enjoyed my dinner and would come back during their happy hour with reduced prices for sure. I'd give the service 5 stars, the food 3, and the atmosphere 4. I think the owner was there singing happy birthday songs in Italian which almost bumped it to 5 stars for the cool experience.

The rye toast was one thick slice, cut in two, and buttered very nicely.  I got the hash browns.  You have the option of getting a short stack instead.  Service was great!

I spoke with the owners son about the surf theme and he was quite a pleasant fellow.  He made everyone who came there feel most wanted.

The lox's saltiness overpowered the dish however, and I was genuinely disappointed. But it was still edible once my mouth adjusted to accommodate the high salt content.

Ordering to-go: Half the food you order in-house but the same price and they expect to be tipped. Tasty, sure. Predictable in a good way.

2 - The CVS Rewards program is great... but for some reason, I can never edit the phone # associated with my account or add an email address.  i've tried to do so online, and I always get error messages which is really annoying!
3 - Not all stores are consistent.  The newer stores are clean and easy to navigate, etc... while some of the older stores need facelifts!

All of those things aside, this particular CVS location has been a great go-to place for pharmacy, toiletries, snacks, magazines, etc... and I'm sure it will continue to be.

Okay, so I was on a super oyster craving that brought me to Big Al's.  They have reasonably priced oysters and wanted to give them a chance, even though they are considerably away from the strip.  

I saw the menu and ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  Good stuff, would totally get it again, not too fishy, clams not too chewy.  A stuff.  Now for the good stuff.

I ordered the russian roulette, which is any 5 oyster shooters and one extra chilled shot of stolichnaya vodka just for good measure.  These were my shooters:
-Big Al's Belvedere shooter(belvedere and an oyster, simple)- 4 out of 5- didn't need much, the belvedere was nice going down, smooth.  good one to start with. 

-Kamikaze(vodka, lime and triple sec)-4 out of 5-good but not amazing.

-Lemon drop(citrus vodka and lime juice)- 3 out of 50- similar to the Kamikaze but lacking somewhere.

-Cajun ole(tequila, cocktail sauce and hot sauce)- 5 out of 5-delicious cocktail sauce and hot sauce went together perfect with the oyster, topped off with black pepper but the tequila was a bit of a change after 3 shots of vodka in. Nonetheless the best shooter in the bunch.  

-Bayou Bloody Mary Shooter(Vodka, tomato juice and tabasco)- 4.5 out of 5- good stuff but would have put some more tabasco in next time.

They also have freezers with some great side items such as risottos, chicken salads, pastas, and different ravioli options AND delicious looking deserts! 

They also have, and what they're well known for, is their great extensive beer, cider, and wine selection. You can buy great local and hard to find 6 packs and individual beers. You can also find a great bottle of wine out of their really comprehensive selection and you won't be disappointed. On top of that they offer wine and beer tastings - which are great. 

They also serve King of Pops, which I love and and are great to grab on the go when walking around South End.

However, the bathroom was very small for the room of this size, but the wet/dry combination of the bathtub/shower is good example of how they utilize the space well.

The worst part of the room is the bedding.  The sheets were made of cotton but the quality is horrible.  Have been sleeping at other non gaming resorts, I felt like I was sleeping with sandpaper.  It was one of the bad bedding but their AC was quiet and strong, definitely needed for Las Vegas.

Squirrel Hill may not have a raging bar scene, but it has the Cage and what more do want, really? Some stupid themed lounge? Brightly colored cocktails? Overpriced bar food that is pretending to be some sort of cuisine? If so, you know where to find them. If not, try the Squirrel Cage.

It's the kind of place where, depending on the day of the week and the time of evening, you can show up with a pack of cards and a group of friends and chill.  Or you can come a little later and enjoy a slightly louder, more crowded atmosphere.

I've had my share of wonderful Greek food, my husband is Greek and happens to be very good at cooking his mom's Greek dishes. This place was a huge disappointment in every way.

1. Service - Awful. One Russian waiter who did EVERYTHING while an old guy stood around and watched him. I saw another table ask where there food was and he said ""I'm the only one here today and all these people came in at the same time"", no apology, nothing. We sat for 15 minutes before our spanikopita came out. Another 20 minutes until our lunch came. At first we thought - this is what we get for going to a Greek restaurant on Greek Easter BUT this place is run by Russians! So that's not even an excuse. We did notice three other tables with Russian patrons were served much more quickly than us.

2. Food - all lukewarm. Spanikopita was like none other I've had, and not in a good way. Hardly any filling and there was crunchy stuff on the top. It was ok, but it certainly wasn't spanikopita. I had the chicken soulvaki and my husband had the lamb. Both meats were lukewarm, probably bc our waiter was spending too much time socializing with one of the Russian tables and the old guy just stood and watched as our dish got cold. The chicken was completely average, my husbands lamb was ok. The dish came with rice, which was very ""wet"". We each had a side salad. The salad was probably the best part of our meal. It was yummy.

3. Atmosphere - it's in a strip mall with a Food 4 Less so let's just say you should not expect it to have a great atmosphere and it certainly lived up to that expectation.

Chicken tikka masala was delicious---especially for here in Phoenix. It's hard to find good Indian food around here. This is the best in the surrounding area. 

Vegetable pakora was pretty good. 

Garlic naan was a bit soggy. Could be better if you ordered it in house.  

Raita was flavorless---I'm from Chicago so I've had some really good ones. Wasn't bad. Just not worth the money. Maybe ok if you need to cool down the spice in your meal but not if you're adding flavor.

Tip: if you go and like sake, get the Crazy Milk and check out the bottle for a few lulz.

We've ordered food twice, I believe, one time being referenced above when it was a full meal and the order was just some sushi for tapas-style appetizers. Neither time has the food impressed me. In fact, it's probably the worst sushi I have ever had. My boyfriend ordered a spicy tuna roll and the tuna looked like baby food, as if someone had chewed it up and spit it back out - no lie.

Cons:  
The ground was absolutely filled with not just dirt and pebbles but huge rocks.  Pushing a stroller or even walking was horrible.  I can't even tell you how many people I saw trip or accidentally kick large rocks at people.  This area needs to be cleared and grated before hosting another event.  All of our feet actually hurt after walking on rocks all night.  I can't believe no one got really hurt.  Lawsuit waiting to happen.
Just like every carnival the rides are so overpriced.  I hate feeling like I'm getting ripped off.
The carnival vendors (food/beverage trailers) were expensive and the employees were rude.
The festival layout felt cramped and chaotic.  It was hard to get around in certain areas due to how close booths were with small pathways.

Pros:
The fireworks were beautiful and I'm glad we stayed to watch.  My kids and I really enjoyed them.
The Happy Nest booth had a lovely quiet spot for feeding and changing babies.
The fresh funnel cake booth by the stage was amazing and fairly priced.  The staff was great there too.
North Las Vegas Police did a great job keeping the peace and ensuring parking was smooth.  Our entrance and exit was the easiest we ever had at a San Gennaro Feast.

This is a fantastic spot for a special occasion.  I ate at the Capital Grille in Indianapolis (see that review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-capital-grille-indianapolis#hrid:z4sbFRVo63w9b03-VEvxOg) the night I got engaged and they did many special things for us.  At my recent experience at the Pittsburgh location, I watched the same personal treatment unfold at a nearby table for a young couple's anniversary.

I recommend the lobster mac n cheese as a side along with the wedge salad and Delmonico cut steak.  You can have any preparation on any steak, so just ask.  You will get plenty of food and be full, so order wisely to avoid wasting money (though this stuff makes for some delicious leftovers).

Maybe because I heard horror stories about the ridiculously long lines, maybe because so many places with similar reputations just don't live up to hype.....I don't know. But my best friends were in town and I decided to pick an ""off time"" to dine (we went at 3pm on a Sunday), if there is ever such a time at this establishment. And thankfully, the wait was less than 10 minutes and we grabbed a seat outside on this lovely day.

First thing we noticed was the HUGE and exhaustive menu. My Gawd....there's more choices on the menu than people named Chin in a Chinese telephone book! Not necessarily a bad thing, mind you. But sometimes you got to wonder if having TOO many choices can lead to execution errors? Maybe I've been watching too many Food Network/Kitchen Nightmare programs......

Back to the review. We started with their coconut battered onion rings with 2 types of dipping sauces: 1 was your traditional ranch style sauce (with Sriracha or horseradish I believe) and another was a Thai sweet chili sauce. Both were excellent, and the onion was surprisingly VERY good. Not soggy at all, crisp with excellent flavor. Great start.

On to the sushi rolls. Got the Mark's Roll which is not on their online menu. It had tuna and cream cheese in it. Tempura battered and flash fried. Need I say more? Was delicious. Not uber flavorful but the texture contrast was excellent. Also tried their Blackened Tuna roll, with lump crab meat, and sliced jalapenos. Almost tasted like a mini crab cake, with heat. Was good. Not the best sushi I've ever had but a solid roll. 

My buddy Dean got the Ultimate Bento Box, which had a very delicious sushi roll, an excellent blend of Thai Sweet/Heat cucumber salad, a double stacked mini burger, edamame and some sweet potato fries. Very good. His wife Lisa got the Greek Salad, which was HUGE! Tip for Ladies......this is one LARGE salad! It would have feed all of us big guys at the table.....just sayin.....And it WAS yummy with fried battered pepperoncinis! Never had them like that before. My buddy and I both got their burgers, as this after all IS supposedly a burger joint! I got the Black Truffle Cheeseburger (they had me at truffle) and my buddy Steve got Boursin Bacon Burger (they had him with Boursin/Bacon). Both met my burger criteria of SLOPPY (meaning uber juicy), flavorful, and cooked no more than MEDIUM (for flavor). The mushrooms were fresh and black truffle cheese excellent! Oh and they serve them on BRIOCHE! I mean, who doesn't love a buttery brioche! The French are probably cringing that we Americans put a BURGER on them! But WTF, who CARES! It was AWESOME to have those flavors stuck between buttery pieces of soft bread! Good call Cowfish!

Finally, like THAT wasn't enough food, my buddy Steve gets a Carmel Chocolate Espresso Milkshake! He really need those extra 1000 or so calories to wash down the 3000 we just consumed! But boy was it delicious!

Tip #2: If you're on ANY kind of diet whatsoever, Cowfish is NOT YOUR PLACE! ""Danger Will Robinson - the Calories are attacking!"" But if you want excellent and flavorful food, then Cowfish IS the place for you! I had to ""suspend"" my diet for this day.....now I've got to bicycle around the world twice and ingest 5 doses of Lipator to get back on track....Can't wait to go back to try their PRIME TIME FILET & LOBSTER ROLL. That sounds yummy!",2014-04-29 01:06:30

The pho is pretty tasty.  The noodles I was served was a little al-dente-ish.  The portions were appropriate with the price. I really liked the broth. It tasted healthier because it wasn't nearly as salty and oily as some places I've tried.

The utensils were clean. At first glance, I thought I was going to hate the metal soup spoons, but they actually worked better than the thicker ones most fancier pho joints use.

My whole life I've been plagued with bad allergies. I envied the people who had seasonal allergies because they only had to experience their allergies part of the year. After a few people, at my now old job, recommended I visit Dr Cohen and his office I thought why not. It never occurred to me in my entire life I could rid myself of this curse of the nose, but this is the story of how it happened. 

If you are not familiar with how an ENT (Ear, nose and throat) doctor works, they first test you for what airborne pollens, grass and dust you are allergic to, they also rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. They tested 60 different things on me, and I tested a 10 out of 10 on 40 of the 60. That's pretty bad. Prior to seeing Dr Cohen my allergies have gotten to the point where I needed to carry an inhaler. I couldn't drive with the windows down ever. I must keep the doors and windows shut to my house. I have to limit my time outdoors in the spring time or suffer the consequences. So my 40 out of 60 score didn't really alarm me. 

Next up they ordered a battery of tests on me including a CT SCAN. It reveled my sinuses were worse than I thought and apart from these tests, I wouldn't have any idea the seriousness of the situation. 

The last step is why I have oh so many checkins here, the shots. Starting in September 2011 to present day, I have been visiting the awesome staff here once a week for 3 shots.  Brenna is the friendly face that checks me in and Jade is the needle rockstar who takes me back for the shots. This spring was the first ever in my life I have been able to live normally and enjoy the beautiful weather Phoenix has to offer like I'm supposed to. 

So how different is life for me? I always have the windows open in the car. When the weather was nicer I would also keep doors open to the apartment to let the fresh air in. I hike Camelback a couple times a week, go bike riding, do crazy things like The Warrior Dash (in a bunch of dust mind you) or chill pool side all weekend. This would not have been remotely possible for me aside from the work Dr. Cohen and his staff have done to alleviate my allergies. I highly recommend this office, plus with my insurance the weekly shots cost me nothing, so you have nothing to lose but all those allergy pills in your medicine cabinet.",2012-05-05 01:11:19

Before you go into the tunnel of rainbow wax they take your payment, tell you to put your car in neutral, no foot on the brake and two men scrub your wheels and grill. You enter through the sudsy passage and get a wipe down on the other side. You'll be directed to a covered parking spot and you'll leave the keys with the gentleman assigned to clean your car.

I go inside the convenience store, grab a bottled water, sit in the massage chair and kick back. There's also some one-armed bandits in there as well if that's your thing.

They have solid soup bases and fresh food at a decent price point for a build-your-own hot pot place. It's more of a 4.5, but I am rounding it to a 5.

Food: 4.5

How It Works: You pick a soup base, which is priced per person, and then you order protein, veggies, and noodles to put in your broth. There's a bar for you to get condiments, including sauces and garnishes.

House Original Pot: This is a traditional broth with dried jujubes, Chinese herbs, corn, and a few other veggies. It might not be for everyone because it does smell and taste a little like those Chinese herbal medicines, but I thought it was nice on a super cold night. Tip: Add a little fried garlic and green onions to round off the flavors.

Assorted Mushroom Pot: As it name states, it is a broth made with an assortment of mushrooms. This is one of my favorites because I love mushrooms.

Dragon King Seafood Pot: If you love seafood, this is the broth that you should pick. Their online menu has 3 different choices as 3 different price points, but they only had 1 choice ($6.99) on the day that I visited.

We ordered Beef Tongue, Seafood Combo Platter, and Veggie Combo Platter. All of the food was really fresh. I definitely recommend ordering the platters to share because they are a better deal and they allow you to try a decent variety if it's your first time. We definitely did not spend a lot (~ $60), but we were stuffed.

ALSO, the owners gave us a free order of wagyu beef because they found out that we were visiting from a different state. Yay!

Service: 4.5

Our waiter was very patient with us and even made some recommendations to help us save money because it was our first time. However, I wished that he explained the restaurant concept to us in a little more detail. He did not explain the conveyor belt or the sauce table to us, so we had to figure that out on our own.

However, the owners do seem to care a lot about what their patrons think. A woman, who I assume is the manager, stopped by to ask us about our meal. She also promised that they would read any comments that we left on their comment sheet or on Yelp. Hopefully, they actually act upon the input that the customers give.

Ambiance: 3.5

The restaurant is located in a quiet plaza not far from the Strip. Even though we came fairly late (~9 pm), there was still a short wait of about 20-30 minutes. I believe that they have a couple of private rooms in addition to the common dining area. The restaurant is pretty cute and decently clean. However, the restaurant could benefit from better ventilation as the smell of all the broths can be slightly overwhelming when you first step into the restaurant. Furthermore, the bathroom is surprisingly dirty in contrast to the restaurant.",2017-01-08 08:04:08

Yep, there's a massive boxing ring surrounded by handmade cooking aprons overlooking the bar, with the venue taking space in a old spacious warehouse.

The energy at The Duce is interesting, with a decidedly retro vibe coming through both the vintage handmade cocktails and the fashionable finds throughout the store, including cruiser bicycles.

The cocktail menu is full of handcrafted drinks, ranging from dirty martinis to grapefruit mimosas.

You can enjoy your drinks on the patio, which also includes an organic produce stand, or in the bar, with simple long tables and some retro furniture filling it up.

Live music takes place on the makeshift stage, which doubles as the boxing ring. When I was there last night, lights were strung up to light up the platform, which was surrounded by old school punching bags and giant tires. When we first arrived to the mixer and sat down to drink, I noticed a trainer and his client doing shoulder presses. It was one of the quirkiest places I've experienced.

And that's why The Duce is so charming. You can wander around and check out the unique finds throughout the space, you can enjoy good food and drinks (I heard the noodle kugel, $4 off the small American menu, was amazing), you can work out, or you can listen to live music. There's also a Chicago soda fountain, and on top of everything else, The Duce hosts ice cream socials and birthday parties.

I'd definitely like to go back during the day some time for brunch, though their brunch menu is served all day long. I bet sitting on the patio in the sun would give a whole different feel to the place, and I can't wait to go back.",2012-07-07 21:17:14

My husband and I decided to go out for a late meal on a Friday night and we had called around to a few different restaurants in the area only to be turned away by all of them. I had read about Fiamma here on Yelp (thank's yelpers!) and we decided it was a good time to give it a try!

We made reservations on OpenTable. I love when restaurants have Open Table! We got to the restaurant which was mostly empty and were immediately seated. 

We were seated in the upper level which I really liked. It seemed a little more intimate. 

When we were seated a waiter came over and poured our waters and set down some homemade pesto, homemade foccacia and breadsticks. 
The foccacia was little bit over salted for me, but the bread was warm and crisp. The pesto is some of the best pesto I've ever tasted. 

The waiter was very kind and explained the specials in a lot of detail to us. We decided to do pasta dishes, as we were there to eat homemade pasta! 

I ordered a pappardelle with a mushroom sauce and truffles. It was creamy without having too much cream. I think that was due to the poached egg that sits on top of the pasta. It was pretty tasty. My husband ordered the pappardelle bolognese and really enjoyed it... so much so that he completely finished his plate!

Both pastas were about $17 each. For the amount of hand crafted love that went into each dish and the portions, we felt that was very reasonable.

It's a breakfast sandwich but different than most it has a spicy sauce and runny scrambled eggs rather than an egg that pops.  The eggs with the cheese worked very well and the addition of turkey sausage really worked.  The brioche bun of course is always a plus when doing breakfast.  For $11 the price is steep, especially considering the size.  Quality is there but it just needs to be bigger to more or less be a scrambled egg brunch meal, then worth the price point.

1st encounter : 3 months ago I spoke with Richard regarding a blower wheel replacement. He provided me with all the information I needed and had me set up an appointment with Alex. Alex sent Justine over to check the wheel. I wanted the wobbly wheel replaced since we had just replaced the unit and blower motor. Justin was extremely professional ( so was Alex ) and informative. He noted the size and model of the wheel, went and picked up a new one and had it installed shortly after. AC was up and running without a noise in no time 

2nd encounter: few weeks after I noticed a rattling noise and contacted Alex. She offered to have a tech come over and scheduled an appointment however the noise went away so I canceled the call. 

3rd encounter : it's January and the rattling noise is back so I messaged Richard. He called me the same day and offered to have someone come by. He assured me that the problem will be taken care off. Justin came by again and discovered the problem was not the blower wheel and it was just two AC duct rubbing against a stud. He pushed them apart and noise hasn't come back since ! Justin is a great guy and an asset to this company ! 

They offered a great price , great service and most importantly they are standing behind their work and warranty.

Day 1 - The salesmen are hovering around the customer parking, and the guy who I parked next to ended up being very nice, and we went on a test drive with no pressure to go inside afterwards. 

Day 2 - The Ford was the only car out of 5 worth returning to, so it was time for my wife to drive it and get some numbers. I'm nearly tackled when I get out of my car and I immediately ask for our salesman. I'm told he's ""on a pickup"" and ""might be a while"" but this guy is glad to help me. Knowing this means it affects my salesman's commission, I find my guy's cell number in my call history, and lo and behold, he's in the back room! The guy out front was trying to poach the sale completely!

Day 2 con't - After another test drive, my wife likes it, I'm still not sure, but we go in for numbers anyway so our salesman doesn't get in trouble. First off, they want me to fill out a credit app, which just isn't happening. They even tried to say they couldn't appraise my trade-in without one! This turned out to be a lie, by the way. 
The numbers on the sheet were pretty good, but I have to sleep on it because they aren't great, and I am not ready to make a deal. Right in front of us, the sales manager berates the salesman for not doing a good enough job and says ""What if I offer you $2000 more on your trade?"" I know that's above KBB but I still need to sleep on it.

Day 3 - That extra $2k is going to seal the deal so I call the salesman and it's his day off, but he'll meet us at the dealership. I return with USAA financing pre-approved and a blank check in hand, ready to leave with a new car. Unfortunately, the offer has COMPLETELY changed. They try three more times to get me to fill out a credit app, even after I told them I've arranged financing. Suddenly, the trade-in is back to the book value, and the quoted price on the sheet isn't ""with taxes tags license"" but rather ""PLUS taxes tags license"". That comes to $3000 more, and even after hard  negotiating he's $1800 more than I wanted to pay (almost the price of the trade, notice), so we walked.

Day 3 con't - I decided to draft this review but not submit it yet. I sleep on everything, even negative Yelp reviews!

Day 4 - Luckily for me, USAA works with San Tan Ford with fixed pricing, so I applied for the USAA car buying price program. Before my laser printer finished printing the documentation, my phone was ringing, and I am now offered invoice on the car, plus I get all eligible incentives. Also, San Tan Ford's $995 ""desert protection package"" of tint and nitrogen filled tires is $251 for USAA members. Net result -- almost exactly what I was trying to negotiate on my own, and zero hassle.

Day 4 con't - I call right before leaving to make sure things are ready, but suddenly my trade in, which was $16000 and then $18000 on day 2, then was back to $16000 on day 3, is now down to only $13500. This, despite a written offer for $16k from Carmax next door. And While could sell my car to Carmax, I'd lose $1250 in sales tax credit, so I'm back at the price from day 3 - just more to the state and not to the dealership. So I had to walk once again. This last one feels like spite for going behind the sales manager's back with USAA, because if a place like Carmax can offer me $16k for the car with no commitment to buy, how can Ford, with over 4000 dealerships nationwide, not figure it out?


So let's recap for the skimmers:

1) Salesmen are like vultures circling the parking lot, hoping you pull into a spot next to them. If my windows were down I wouldn't be surprised to hear them calling ""Dibs!""

2) USAA / TrueCar can get you awesome deals, otherwise the pressure is on and the hard sell begins.

3) San Tan Ford will make promises they have no intention to keep, just in an attempt to keep you from walking out the door - they hope to wear you down and get you to agree after taking away the carrot and giving you the stick.

4) Every car on the lot had a $995 ""desert protection package"" installed, which is tint, VIN etching the windows, and putting nitrogen in the tires. This is on top of the sticker price of the car, but can be negotiated as low as $251.

5) I didn't get this far, but their Doc fee is an atrocious $499.

Overall a good show, however, and would recommend it.   There really are no bad seats in the house and I would not recommend paying extra for seats closer to the stage.",2009-11-10 03:29:13

Tea-rrific! Nothing gets my nose more excited than a chance to sniff delightful aromas-and at Oolong, I get to do exactly that! Three bookcases full of tea, each with its own jar for you to open and take a whiff. Take your pick, then grab the cannister behind it and present it to one of the lovely employees behind the counter. Take note, the tea comes in different classes. The higher the class, the higher the price point. 

What's also nice is that you can refill your hot water to get the most out of your tea. No need to stop at one pot only to spend $4+ on a new brew.

My first impression of the restaurant was that it was very dark and dingy. The decor of the place itself was also very dated and there does not appear to have been any recent renovations . The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly though, however I suggest that you go early (1130-1145) because the place tends to get very busy at around noon. Towards the end of our lunch it did get a little noisy.

I ordered the breakfast poutine which consisted of home fries, cheese curds, bacon, off-the-bone baked ham, poached eggs & hollandaise sauce and it also came w/ toast. 

When our order arrived the first thing I noticed was the size of the poutine and how it was a rather small portion. I guess it is an ideal size for breakfast however I think it was a little overpriced at $11.99 for the little bowl that we got. The poutine itself was rather tasty. The hollaindaise sauce was well made - creamy with a hint of lemon. It complemented well with the homefries, bacon, ham, and egg and really ""bound"" them all together to make a decent breakfast poutine. 

One complaint other than the size was that I had ordered homefries but instead got regular fries in my poutine. I did let the waitress know and she was very apologetic and offered to have the kitchen make a new one but due to the time constraint I opted to eat what was given to me which ended up not being bad at all.

Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant was very casual. I think they need to change the colors and the lighting to brighten the place up a bit as it is fairly dark inside but it wasn't dirty...just dark. The service was great - food came quickly and we were in and out of there within an hour. The food was good. It wasn't the best in Toronto but it was tasty and the breakfast poutine was a very creative way to serve breakfast.",2013-02-03 11:58:34

There were employees all throughout the front and no one ever said hello or greeted us. Three cashiers were at the front and only one was helping out a customer. We were still looking over the menu so we didn't care that they didn't acknowledge us. We were finally ready and the one guy just stood there looking at us so we walked his way. 

Our orders:

One half of a turkey avocado sandwich and a cup of potato cream cheese soup 

One blt sandwich and a side of broccoli cheddar soup

One small soda and water

My total: $24


We got our number, our drinks, and headed to a booth. 

We didn't wait too long and a vey VERY friendly employee dropped off our food. He was so nice. We were fine at the moment and so we dug in.

I have been to Eez at least 10x so this is based on several visits!  First of all, when they are good, their sushi is hard to beat BUT sometimes they use way too much rice on it.  For the size of the rolls and the amount of fish, they prices (which are high) are not too too bad.  
The service is 50/50....really really bad or a little better than average are your two choices.  The greeters in the front are seldom warm and welcoming and sometimes they watch from the bar as you wait in front.  
They offer a creme brullee of the month each month....don't bother! Just get the regular bc they mess up the consistency horribly bad w the special ones.  

All in all, Eez is a cool plan, good surrounding, speciality rolls that are pretty awesome but Sushi at the Lake and Edomamae (sp?) are both as good!  Sushi at the lake w better special rolls than Edomamae while Ed has very good basic stuff.

Noodles: 5*, big round fresh noodles with perfect chew

Decor: can't eat it as a fellow Yelper said, so not important! 

I was hoping for a similar experience to my favourite noodle joint(msg me for that place) but it missed the ball on spice and beef softness.

Legume is a spot that I haven't been to since it was a tiny affair in Regent Square. Wild success bought them a much larger space in North Oakland, amid cheap college housing and Pittsburgh culinary staples like Lulu's Noodles, this might have seemed like a strange move to make. So strange to me, in fact, that I let Legume slip silently from my mind and never considered it again, until recently.

Searching and re-searching Yelp for some restaurant or unique feature that I may have missed on the last pass, as I often do, I happened to stumble across the fact that this new-and-improved Legume had a bar! Aptly named, the Full Service Bar is open from 4p-midnight, and offers not only a solid beer and wine selection, but a fair selection of small bar-bites from the kitchen, which is also open until midnight. Honestly, though, I can go anywhere in town to grab a beer and a bite - what drew me in was that they not only have a 4p-6p happy hour, but a 10p-midnight happy hour as well! That's right, stop in for skillfully crafted bar food and discount drinks, specifically $2 off drafts, $4 wines, and $5 well drinks - along with some weekly specials(ie, $5 punch on Monday) and live music/DJs(I think Zombo plays Tuesdays)

We arrived at about half-past 10 and Legume itself had already closed, but the bar has a separate entrance in the entryway. The bar is beautiful, lined with comfortable leather-backed barstools, a high-table with a wooden alcove, and dimly lit by candles and sconces on the wall. In the back are a few low 4-seat tables with leather chairs to have a group of people sit. The bartender greeted us quickly and handed us a cocktail and draft list, along with a bar menu. The menu has about 6-8 small plates, a few soup/salads, and 3-4 dessert options. The draft list was decent, however 2 slots of their 10 choices were wasted on Miller Lite and America's oldest brewery(Yuengling). The bartender was happy, though, to give us samples of Duck-Rabbit Doppelbock and Southern Tier's 2x Stout(She was also nice to our fellow patrons, giving them a whirlwind tour of the finer points of gin and a quick intro to Mezcal). 

My girlfriend stuck to her 2X($4), while I wound up with a standard Manhattan, which turned out to not be part of the $5 well drinks(it was $8), but the bartender let me slide since she wasn't aware until after it was made. We also settled on an order or Risotto Balls($4) - coming 8 to a set(think Lindt truffle-sized) with a small ramekin of something that seemed an awful lot like citrusy mayo, but it was dark enough in the bar that I could pretend to uphold my diet by not asking. The risotto balls were very crispy on the outside and the inside was creamy and delicious - definitely a nice alternative to french fries. 

Having finished our risotto balls but not our drinks, we also ordered the crostini with ch√®vre and pepper jelly($4) - a kitchen open as late as the bar is such an overlooked luxury! They arrived quickly, 4 slices of toasted bread completely overloaded with goat cheese, and a dollop of sweet and spicy heaven on top of each. The cool and creamy goat cheese really paired well with the flavor of the jelly, and the jelly itself was so good I grabbed every last bit I could from the plate.

I still have yet to try the restaurant portion of Legume, but the bar has certainly won me as a late-night regular, especially on a low-key but classy evening. Also, they have their own twitter @FullServiceBar, so be sure to keep up!",2012-04-11 00:54:17

Do not let this location fool you.  Just look for the big building on the corner, park in the lot and go to the first floor.

You know what I'm talking about: the place that seems slightly shady where there's like 10 different waiters who never make eye contact who seem to come and go at random times...Hell no, this place is relatively classy.  So if you're looking for the authentic experience, perhaps not what you should be looking for.  You'll notice a very modernized decor which is somewhat soothing, or at least I think.  

The service-tends to be good the times I have been here.

The menu-relatively extensive with bias towards North Indian cuisine.  Nevertheless, many classics are on the menu and you should find something that will appeal to you.  Tremendous vegetarian selection.

The actual taste-amazing.  Just make sure you spice it to what you can handle.  If you're new to Indian food and can't handle the heat, don't go above a 5.

The fresh baked rolls are delicious and for $3 the Bbq pork hoagie is such a great deal. I love the tender pork paired with the crunchy carrots and diakon with a hint of spice.

Check out their buy two drinks and get one free, so we got all three flavors: Jenny green Jelly, Thai iced tea and Bob milk tea.

My friend Susan and I were going to a work party that started at 7.30pm.  I'm not sure exactly what time we eventually tottered up to the door-maybe 8.30pm.  It had taken me way too long to do my hair and she had a wardrobe emergency.  I also still have a tendency to work on ""Irish time"" where 7.30pm means 9pm at the earliest.  Anyway, we entered and asked the maitre d where to go.  He beamed and started to lead us in the right direction-but also managed to tell us we were late in a semi-scolding manner.  I think he may have been joking?

The function room upstairs is medium-sized and airy.  Smiling staff came through offering hors d'oeuvres.  I wasn't that hungry but they were so friendly that it seemed rude to refuse.  They were very tasty!  I particularly liked the duck and pear.  Mmmm.  The bar staff were similarly lovely and incredibly patient with a crowd that rapidly became rather tipsy thanks to drinks vouchers.  They managed to keep beaming. I maintain that they were generous with their pours too.  I need to explain my dancing later in the night somehow! .

A nice plus was the huge TV on the wall which was set up for presentations-we got to see a movie that had been put together for the occasion.  The bathrooms were spotless and seemed to be only for the room.  There were no lines!

They are soaked in too much dressing, odd tasting chicken with a somewhat slimy texture and I don't like the set-up of their counter service.

My mom was in town and she likes PB, so we shared a southwest chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll and a southwest ceasar salad, maybe too much ""southwest"" in one meal, but it all tasted over dressed and the bread was tasteless.  She looked at me and said ""we should have gone to Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ for the same price.""  I would have to agree.

Usually their steak is cooked a tad more than requested, so I usually go with rare which is more like medium rare. For under $20, this is a decent cut of steak and it'll sure fill up your belly.

T5sYmLZcsm5Y4VBwfrll4A,0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw,4,1,0,0,"So close but so far is all I can say of this new restaurant.  I went with a friend on opening night and everything was perfect; the meat was cooked to order, the toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, the bun was great, and I walked out of there claiming that it might have unseated Burger Bar as one of my favorites (More on Burger Bar in a future article).  The bacon, cheese, and garlic aioli all had great flavor, and didn't compete with each other.  I went back a second time a week later with the always negative writer of our sister site, the Boston Burger Blog, and the meat was very overcooked.  Again the toppings and bun were excellent, but the overcooked meat greatly took away from our experience and flavor.  We both agreed that if the meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, it would have earned several more points.  Being a restaurant that has a burger and shake theme, this is something that really should be right every time.

But as you know, the burger isn't the only factor taken into consideration.  The fries need work.  The first time I ate there our waiter explained that we needed to get the shoestring fries because they were a clone of McDonalds' fries, and they were.  They were really good, and maybe lacked some of the greasiness that coincide with the big chain's version.  The second time they seemed to be a bit different, and almost seemed to stray towards the lackluster fries of Burger King after the Great Change.  The duck fat fries also seemed a bit better the first time than the second.  Another great item were the 'loaded' shakes; mostly classic flavors and mixes with a good amount of alcohol in each one.  While they are a bit expensive, the few that I've tried have all been quite tasty.

I managed to squeeze a third visit here in the midst of my busy schedule, and this time there were more problems.  First of all, we had a horrible wait for food; people sat after us, ate and left before any of our food arrived to our table.  The restaurant was severely understaffed for some convention that was in town that week.  While I understand that rushes do occur, some careful planning and a bit of coordination with the hotel management to see what kind of occupancies you'll have from week to week would be a good idea.  On top of our wait, I got steak fries instead of shoestring, which isn't a deal breaker, but when I'm supposed to be finding anything wrong with my meal this makes it easy.  Like my first visit, the meat was cooked perfectly so this gives me hope that they might be back to their original form, even with a packed house. My Asian themed burger had great flavor overall, and a little bit of a bite which was welcome.  It came topped with an over-easy egg that was cooked perfectly, and a glaze that had good flavor.

All things considered, this restaurant has already brought me in for three separate visits so there is some merit to that.  But the inconsistencies from meal to meal, combined with the not-so-great service prevent me from bumping this burger to the next level.  It's definitely worth a first time visit, if not just to experience the Cosmopolitan property and take in extreme Vegas opulence.",2011-08-13 17:56:35

The locations vary somewhat, but they all have busy parking lots, are somewhat grubby, and (especially here and the Maryland/Charleston location), you are quite likely to be hit up for change. I, personally, have mastered the art of the pre-emptive dirty look, and since my appearance is quite formidable, I have very little problem on that score. 

My favorite is the produce section. You can't really go in with a list expecting to find what you want, so you have to go with what they have. I have frequently found: large tubs of Earthbound Farms organic baby greens, bags of mixed sweet mini-peppers, pints of blackberries, blueberries & raspberries and quarts of strawberries, personal sized watermelons, 2 and 3 lb bags of grapes, portabello mushrooms, bunches of asparagus, grape tomatoes, bags of brussell sprouts, you get the drill. They almost always have bagged salads, potatoes, cucumbers, etc. I actually got a 3 lb pack of the best oranges I ever ate there. In the dairy case, I have scored logs of goat cheese, packages of Laughing Cows, ready-to-bake Pillsbury brownies, a huge carton of PollyO  (back east) ricotta, the deluxe lunchables that are 4 bucks at WallyWorld, and my best so far was a family-sized tub of Nestle chocolate chip cookie dough. On the shelves, my greatest hits were full-size packages of name brand cookies, large bags of Almond Roca, bags of pistachios, large bags of organic chips, beef jerky with bbq dip that appeared, again at WW, 2 weeks later for 5 bucks, 48 oz. Welch's grape juice, big jars of Hellman's (Best Foods to you) mayo, and jars of Planter's macadamia nuts. For $1? Hell, ya! I bought a case. 
Other stuff: My mom needed pills for congestion that were $14 at WW and $8 for the store band. Tried the 99 cent brand and they were just the same. Score! I even found these cool laundry folding devices they were selling on home shopping for $15. My best purchase that I almost regret: They had four giant rolls of foil metallic wrapping paper in different designs and colors. I wrap a lot of gifts, so I bought them all. That was about three years ago, and thank god we just had a shower for a baby girl so I could use up the last of the pink one. That was beautiful, thick, high quality stuff, but those rolls never ended and we all got sick of looking at presents wrapped in the same old thing. Damn!

My purchases that I do regret: Almost anything in the soap or toiletry line that isn't name brand. They tend to be very poor quality. You can't trust the canned goods or their packaged food with unrecognizable labels, and most of the cheese products are imitation. Batteries have a short life but are OK to attach to gifts that require batteries. Frozen meats are ghastly. Go with the pizza rolls. Happy hunting!

I had read the Yelp reviews and had wanted to go for weeks now.  So on the way back from sitting for 30 minutes in an MRI tube, I stopped at what I was sure was going to be a grand slam.  Kind of a rough part of Bethany Home Road but I figured it should be ok and it was, don't let it scare you off.  Walked in and the place was full of people but no one had any food in front of them and since it was nearly 1 PM, I figured everyone is already done with lunch (wrong).  Ordered the brisket sandwich and two sides for around $6.50, reasonable enough and even comes with a drink.  I was order #17.  I waited for my to-go order by the side counter.  After about 10 minutes they called #10 and that was my first red flag.  I thought this could be awhile.  Sure enough a few minutes later they called #11, then #13.  Twenty minutes in they called #8 and it was pretty obvious they lacked institutional restaurant control.  One of the patrons walked up to the counter and asked for his money back, that he couldn't wait anymore.  I asked how long he had been waiting and he said an hour and a half.  At 35 minutes and really late for work I asked for my money back and they said it was coming right out.  Oops, turns out #14 was coming out not #17.  At that point I just walked out with the nice lady behind the counter telling me she would give me my money back.  I just kept walking and will dispute the charge later with AmEx.  They seemed like really nice people, the place was clean, and (supposedly) the food is good.   The questions you have to ask yourself is, ""Do I feel lucky?"" and ""Do I have the disposable time to wait up to 90 minutes for BBQ"" -especially when Bobby-Q's is a mile up the road and I can get my meal in under 5 minutes.  Very disappointing.",2012-05-03 21:47:19

I was absolutely bowled over. When I came in and said I wanted to see the Restaurant Week menu, the waitress took the menu out of my hands. I said ""Wait, I wanted to choose something."" Then she said ""No, you get EVERYTHING."" What?? Can this be?! Everything was delicious but the cuteness of the tasting proportions was deceptive. I was almost stuffed after the first course! The first plate had a mini grilled cheese and turkey sandwich, a baked potato soup and a very tender short rib with brussel sprouts and grilled pear. You could tell real thought went into the menu. The second course included a quarter section of a pumpkin waffle with chicken. I had to save that for the take-out box. But I miraculously found room for the smoked pork belly steak. So fat but so good. 

The second time I went there was for the Bacon Board. What a great offer. Unfortunately it's the reason I can't go back there too often, hehe. I truly heart the Bacon Board. 

I also love the decor. This is another instance of a restaurant that is too good for its strip-mall location. It's a kind of rustic feel with a lot of wood and metal but they use empty bottles for the light fixture that add a cozy ambiance. This place is conveniently located right by the Shea exit on the 51.

I had the daily special which was the Swiss steak.  Three people in our party ordered the special and all of our steaks were tough and not edible.  We all sent it back and switched to the prime rib which was actually pretty good.  This experience tells me to stick to the menu items that are regular items and avoid the specials that are once a week items that limits the restaurant's prep experience.  

Service was fantastic and the dining room is big so waiting times were reasonable.  I think it's funny that they have two menus: a regular traditional caf√© menu and a separate Chinese/Asian menu.  From the outside you wouldn't know that there was a secret Chinese restaurant in this unassuming cafe.  There were several tables ordering from the Chinese menu and the dishes were served in distinct looking stainless steel platters.  From the looks of the food it seemed pretty good. 

Give this place a try. If you don't like your order send it back and they will cheerfully replace it with something else and hopefully better for you.  Also if you visit after 11:30 pm -  the late-night menu is great and I don't think you can go wrong with the steak and eggs.",2014-07-06 20:45:12

I adopted my buddy Jake from here 4 years ago. He is a great dog. I come here every year to get his shots. They have a walk in clinic on Fridays. It opens at 8am and get there early because the morning slots do fill up. You have to wait around but they get to everyone as quickly as they can. They close at 12 for lunch and reopen at 1pm. So if you miss the morning you can come back. They will give you the paper work to fill out so when you come back after 1 you can just turn it in and be all set.
They have a great staff in the clinic and the adoption center. They are all very helpful and love animals. Most are volunteers.
If I ever want to get a second dog I will definitely be back here. They really work with you to make sure the animal is right for you and that you have a good home for it. They also make sure you are ready for the responsibility of owning a pet. They really do want to find forever homes for all of their animals. They are always getting new animals in so if you don't see one that suits you go back and they will have all new ones. It is a little sad that there are that many homeless animals and that the problem is a big as it is but they are really working hard everyday to basically put themselves out of business. It would be great to not have any more homeless or unwanted pets anymore. 
You can make donations on their website or if you want to drop off blankets or toys or whatever you can. They really do need all the help they can get. They care for a lot of animals and provide a great level of care for all of them. But to maintain that they need help.
They have a very nice facility on Dobbins. I have never been to the other location. It might be a little bit of a drive but to find a best friend or take care of the one you have it is a great place and worth the trip.

Service was good. Not extremely fast, but the drinks seem to be made with care, so it was a worthy trade-off.

One, the lines will get pretty long at each booth....people love wine so there is a pretty good crowd out there.  I don't mind a line but I think people need to chat less and sample more.  Secondly, it's a lot of NC Wineries and so you are going to find more sweet, fruity wine than anything else.

This place seems like a lovely brunch place and we spent a good 15minutes trying to decide what we wanted from the menu because we were starved and everything sounded amazing. 
We got the Eggs Benedict, two breakfast sandwiches, and kaluha cappuccino. The drink was amazing, it was almost like a milkshake with lots of alcohol (totally worth the price) but we were so disappointed with the food. 
The eggs on the eggs Benedict was over cooked, when we told the staff this- he gave us the most condescending look before he went back and got other eggs which were again over cooked (no surprise there). After which he tried to tell me that 'this is how eggs Benedict's are' 

The house fries aren't good, the sandwiches weren't special at all and the whole experience felt like the 20minute line up to get into the restaurant was an utter waste.

The place is very technologically advanced (machine that smushed rice into seaweed) and also Eco-friendly (recycled/repurposed furniture). It made me feel good supporting this business.

Jaburritos does a fusion burrito with sushi concept. You choose a wrap like soy paper or seaweed and then you pick the insides a la Subway type ordering. I opted for one of their pre-decided burritos. 

It had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and an array of veggies. With soy paper I enjoyed the freshness of the burrito. Their veggies were great and the spicy tuna was good. My let down was the shrimp tempura. They give you 2 pieces and the shrimp have very little shrimp in it. The shrimp they use are super breaded. It literally shouldn't even have been on there it was THAT small.  
The price with a canned green tea came out to about $14. Which I think was worth the price. I think for $10.95 a burrito that they could use better shrimp for their shrimp tempura.

I also tried one of their burritos with steak in it and one of their salmon burritos. They were both very good.

Overall I did like Jaburritos, but in my honest opinion I wouldn't go here often. The concept is great and the food is good, flavorful, unique. I would just rather go to an AYCE sushi place is all. I can't be the only one out there. It's really just giant hand rolls. That's just me. To me this falls into the novelty category. I'm glad I tried it, I liked it, but there is an alternative I'd rather go to called all you can eat sushi.

My experience of Indian restaurants can very greatly. Most of which have been mediocre food, shabby decor, and buffets that are a borderline health violations. 

The saffron patch takes Indian dinning to another level. 

Tucked in the basement of a commercial office building, this restaurant is hard to find and you really have to know where to go to find it, but when you do you will be well rewarded. 

The entrance brings you to a small bar area and Host station, always clean and organized. When your greeted they escort you into the dinning room which has a small buffet area large ceilings and a private area in the back. The d√©cor is updated, and stylish decorated with a touch of business formal and a hint of ethnic theme. 

On the weekdays they offer a lunch buffet which opens at 11:30. The buffet consist of Indian staples such as, Tandoori Chicken, Mutter Paneer, Chicken Makhami, Chicken Kheema Masala, Masala, Alu Gobi, Maingan Bhartha, Dal, not forgetting the delicious Naan bread, and Rice. 

Items on the menu change daily. Some of my favorites are the Vegetable Pakoda, Somosa, Paneer Pakoda, Matka Gosht, and garlic Naan. The buffet is always well presented and offer a sufficient variety.  

I would have to say that one of my favorite things about a good Indian restaurant, is the vegetarian selection. Although I may not be a vegetarian, I do however love to eat well prepared veggie meals. If I could have such great veggie dishes prepared for me everyday of this caliber I would be a full blow vegg fanatic.  I have tried many vegetarian dishes from California to Kolkata, and there are no vegetarian dishes I love more than Indian cuisine, and the Saffron Patch has to be one of my favorites. 

They also offer a variety of Indian deserts, ""sigh"", not to many I'm a fan of.. I do however love Indian style rice pudding, or Kheer. They also offer, Badam Burfi, Gulab Jamum, Gajar Halva, and Sooji Halva and fresh fruit.

Out of all the Indian restaurants I have dined in the U.S., I would have to say my favorites are located in NE United States, 1 - Raj Mahal in Erie Pa., and The Saffron Patch in Beachwood  Ohio.

I rate the Saffron Patch 7/10

This has become one of our families favorite places to go.  It is a true culinary experience.  We have been here three times and each visit had it's own highlights to make the visit memorable.  The ambience is impeccable; it isn't so much created by the decor but by the people serving you.  From the moment you arrive you are called by your name and treated like you are part of the family.  Every employee is attentive to make sure that you are comfortable and receiving the Kai experience.

Once you are seated you are treated to an explanation of the restaurant and it's vision.  They explain how everything from the menus (printed and placed in mesquite wood that was crafted from a member of the local tribe) to the food has been locally sourced.  You won't run out of options in terms of what your tastebuds may be tingling for as the menu provides a myriad of different options to satisfy your cravings.

Service is impeccable.  Upon our first visit we were actually a little startled when each of us had an attendant.  When your food is prepared they come out in one synchronous ballet to deliver your entrees at precisely the same moment.

The golf course view from the restaurant and the Westin in general are beautiful, but this place is just blah.  From the menu and prices you'd think that the ambiance would be nice and food would be phenomenal resort fare, but this place misses the mark entirely.  What you get is a stark atmosphere that has very little to do with the supposed theme of the place and food that just isn't that good.  I'm normally a ribeye fan, but after one look at this place and knowing that this definitely isn't a steak house, I decided to get something that I didn't think they could screw up; a $21 burger.  You would think that, because of the location of this place and the prices, that they could master making the best burger and fries possible.  Wrong.  Instead, what you get is Applebee's.  Well, at Applebee's they might cook it properly so that is probably a bad comparison.

I guess what it comes down to is that the Westin really doesn't expect the people to come back.  They have a steady flow of suckers on expense accounts that might not know there are top-notch restaurants less than a quarter mile away.

Dinner at Mimi's Cafe is an experience -- a very dull disappointing experience, at least at this branch.  I hope other locations are better, but I am beginning to think that the brain trust at Mimi's corporate central has a disdain for salt, pepper, or any other spice.  For example, my pot roast dinner, including a mixture of carrots and broccoli and a scoop of mashed potatoes, all heaped on one half of the plate, contained not a jot of taste.  The gelatenous brown ""gravy"" that was slobbered wholesale on the mashed potatoes and pot roast was a miracle -- how could they have managed to take the salt OUT of canned gravy?  Or did they actually make it themselves ... on purpose???  My wife's meal (chicken crepes) was just as bad.  The corn chowder did, I admit, have a little seasoning, but it was the thickness of school paste and tasted much the same.  The pork sliders had a sweet BBQ sauce, but the pork itself was mush.

The restaurant was clean and comfortable, and the service proper but distant and not very attentive.  But the food is the big problem here.

I hope the cook staff at this Mimis is just ignorant, uncaring, or hungover, because otherwise there is no hope whatsoever for this chain.

Note:  I have also eaten at Mimi's for breakfast several times.  Although better than dinner, Mimi's breakfasts are pretty ordinary.  The bakery items are, in general, better than the egg dishes, pancakes and waffles -- all of which are bland.  The muffins that accompany most meals are a cut above average.",2012-02-06 15:32:24

My short list of faves include the Hamachi Crudo with tender bites of Hamachi in a sweet and spicy dressing, Duck Fat Potatoes are always great served with ailoi, Wagyu Beef was a surprise hit at the table as well while the Crispy Oysters which are a must try. Just when we all were sitting back and sipping a nice bottle of Cabernet, the pasta dishes started rolling out.  Ravioli stuffed with country ham, Tagliatelle, Bucatini with venison, and Squid Ink Conchiglie. Honestly at this point I was done. All of the pasta dishes were great but I would lean towards the Tagliatelle as my favorite.  

Following the pasta dishes we closed with Chocolate Birthday Cake, Ice Cream & Cookies and Milk Bread Cinnamon rolls.  Go with the Cinnamon roll here but all were great.

I was greeted by a cozy atmosphere that was sort of speakeasy-esque. Vintage meets modern here, where tattooed, blue haired bartenders craft specialty cocktails, and a nerdy guy sings Britney Spears and Journey along with his own piano accompaniment. Very entertaining and made me smile a number of times.

The hostess was on point. She told us there was no table at the moment but she would let us know. After about 20 minutes, we had settled in by a ledge, perching our drinks on what seemed like a faux wooden log, when she approached us and let us know that a table had become available. Nice! I kind of expected her to just forget about us, but she made a point of tending to the guests in addition to maintaining her post at the front.

The drinks were tasty, but not the best ever. However, they were pretty strong, and had a slow-burning effect, if that makes sense. They hit me gradually after awhile, instead of a knockout punch. I liked that.

We tried the charcuterie plate too, which had delicious bread and really standout cheeses. Marcona almonds are my favorite!

At no point during my visit did I think ""I'm too old for this."" Ages were mixed and so were personalities.

Duffs makes the perfect chicken wings. Huge wings with taste spicy vinegary sauce. The sauce gets all over your fingers and your face when you eat the wings and if thats not how wings are supposed to be then I don't know anything. I always get my wings medium hot but I tried one of my dads hot wings and there wasn't much of a difference between the flavours. 

Unlike that disgrace of a chicken winger the crown and dragon (flash back from the horrible meal) at Duffs you leave full and don't have to try and find a McDonalds afterwards. The fries are great and I love to dip them in the dill sauce that comes with the celery that I never eat. 

Still owned by the original owner and he's still around her was working while I was there this is probably why this place is still so great. Service is superb and although the place is super small it actually can seat quiet a few people. Anyone who complains knows nothing about chicken wings and should head over to pizza pizza and get some of those wings or whatever they try and pass off as wings. Duffs makes the best wings in the city, they just can't be beat and I think I should try to find a better place because I know I'll just leave disappointed.

My friend ordered a certain Zinfandel and they were out of that as well. I don't understand that because it was a Saturday night. You need to be prepared and stocked for your customers. I ordered the Philly roll of course and the Salmon Tempura. Both rolls were ok but nothing special.

The wife and I dipped in for lunch yesterday and had a great experience, on the whole.  Decor is fittingly ""fresh"" with the live fern wall, mason jar light fixtures, organically shaped silverware and artichoke-shaped salt and pepper shakers on each table.  The space is definitely small, with only one outside picnic table and then a couple rooms inside that feel a bit more like a retail storefront than a space designed for dining.  This is a trend, recently, but it was not a major distraction.

As we were seated and browsed the menu, we were served a very refreshing glass of cucumber water that ended up being my beverage of choice.  There is an entire juice menu, though, that is worth a look and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the finer honey iced tea- enough so that no sweetener was required!

The menu is divided into small bites, sandwiches and mains, but this was somewhat deciding as the ""small bite"" indian tacos I had were plenty for a full meal.  Unwise to this, though, we did start off with a side of the homemade root vegetable chips.  There were freshly fried discs of beets and sweet potato on this day.  Nicely salted and crisp, but a bit on the oily side- like they could have used another minute or two of draining and blotting before heading out in their little flower pot server.  

As for the main meal, I found the indian tacos to be tasty and filling, even if taco is a bit of a misnomer.  I had three rounds discus of puffy indian fry bread loaded on top with a nicely-spiced bean and squash chili.  Textures and tastes melded nicely, but there was no way these things fold up taco style.  I ate then more like a tostada.

The wife's panini was also substantial- with thick slices of a multigrain bread and plenty of veggies inside.  The sun dried tomato pesto added a nice flavor to counter the mozzarella cheese.  

Certainly the rest of the menu was tempting: the pot pie served with croissant, the om burger, even the buddah bowl all had high potential.  Not to be overlooked, though, was the new dessert menu.  Flourless chocolate cake, coconut cupcake, and an apple crisp all tempted.

Fern is the real deal with the kitchen and the cooks to make some amazing meals.   The menu evinces a dedication to local and seasonal sourcing and there is clearly some creative talent used in bringing these ingredients together to great a plate that is insanely fresh and tasty.

Walking up I was told to wait to be seated. It took another 10 minutes to have someone come over and give me water. The part that bothered me the most was the girls were behind the counter complaining how slow it was. They waited another 10 minutes before the waitress actually came over to me. At this time I ordered a $4 nitro cold brew coffee. I attempted to order my lunch at the same time but she walked away mid-sentence.

The coffee was 3 star taste, but I think it would have been better had it been colder. Perhaps I should have asked for ice, but it's odd to have nitro on ice. 

When she came back I ordered the $13 buffalo ""chicken"" wrap. It came out rather quickly. Their fake chicken is spot-on! I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately it didn't taste anything like buffalo but rather bbq. It was even the color of bbq - maybe I was given the wrong one. Had they had a vegan cayenne-based hot sauce it would have been a lot better. I make vegan wing sauce at home all of the time, It's very easy. 

I ended up eating it like a salad because the burrito fell apart. I dumped the contents out, drizzled the ranch, and embraced it as a salad. Their sunflower seed ranch is the bomb! I'm very impressed with how much it tastes like ranch despite being vegan.

In fact, aside from dessert, it's definitely my favorite meal of the day.  Unfortunately I just wasn't blown away with this restaurant.

The interior is kinda bad.  The furniture/booths all look like they came from a 70's diner and there is also a really bad tile job done on the walls.  It looks like it belongs in a cheap Italian restaurant, not a diner.  All the tables are extremely close too, but I don't mind that.  I say maximize your space when you can.  Just be warned if you freak out when people are close to your personal space.

The menu is relatively varied and the prices are all fair.  I was, however, a little surprised at 3.50 for a side of bacon.  For my breakfast, I got a Belgian Waffle (on the menu it says Belgium Waffle and I laughed) and a side of bacon.  The waffle was tasty and quite fluffy.  It was served with two types of syrups, regular maple and a blueberry.  Both were delicious.  The bacon was good, but the ends were strangely ""beef-jerky"" like.  Overall, my meal was good and filling.

Service was pretty much on par with any breakfast/diner place.  They took your order, brought your food and drinks, and then pretty much left you alone after that.  That's always a good thing at breakfast, because I don't really like to linger.  The Place isn't bad but it isn't my favorite either.",2009-08-24 16:23:49

Dishes are usually ordered family style, which is everyone sharing multiple dishes; the usual suspects include salt and pepper squid, shrimp w/ mayo, chinese watercress (kong xing cai) or baby pea sprouts (do miao), and crispy fried milk.  Sometimes I've ordered their Peking Duck, but its nothing spectacular, China Palace serves up better Peking Duck.  Also their Twice Cooked Pork is also lackluster.

OC has a decent liquor selection, and their drinks are relatively cheap at under 5 dollars each.

Prices for dishes are typically in the lower to mid teens; a typical check tends to run around 20ish for those with larger appetites, drinks not included.

OC is pretty good Canto food by Pittsburgh standards, but for people who are use to better options for Cantonese style Chinese food found in more Asian-populated cities, the food may leave more to be desired.",2009-01-01 16:18:39

It takes them REALLY long time to make the food even though it's just small portion of food and appetizer. I ordered their beef rice bowl and it took them almost half an hour to make it. I mean I wouldn't mind if they could give us some appetizer at least to make us feel their cooking time is shorter or anything. Or maybe it's just me that easily get annoyed when I'm hungry lol 

Also, their food portion was really small and even just for a girl. I don't eat lunch before I come here but it's happy hour set so of course the portion is gonna be smaller but I didn't expect that after that small bowl of rice I'll still have room for another bowl of rice...compare to other places like Hong Kong style restaurant I can get double of the portion while paying the same amount of the money.

However, good thing about this place is the environment and atmosphere of the restaurant were pretty satisfying and nicely decorated.

The Duce gets one star for numerous reasons: 

1. In an effort to be retro-cool, its beer list is comprised exclusively of crap you would drink at a dive bar in Chicago, in the 1970s. And I can appreciate that, and even favor it. But at least offer us a choice. This is the American West. Many of us will drink PBR once in our lifetimes for kicks, conclude that it tastes like carbonated piss (which it absolutely does), and promptly go back to our Kiltlifters and Fat Tires. 

2. I live in the neighborhood, just blocks away from Chase Field. I am 100% judgmental of baseball fans who live here but cheer for any visiting team, and rest assured that I'm in very good company as a downtowner. Anyone in tune with how our city works knows that this is a major pet peeve of its long-time residents. So, I can only conclude that the Duce is out of tune with us on this point, too: it advertises itself as a venue friendly to *another* team in the National League that I refuse to name here. Strike 2.

3. A friend texted me not too long ago to say that he and his girlfriend were in my neighborhood to check out the Duce on a Saturday morning, and would I care to join them for breakfast? Before I could answer, I got another text: ""wtf! It's closed!"" The Duce has horrendous, laughable hours. Right now it doesn't even bother opening on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays at all. On the 4 days of the week it's open, it still shuts down at 10 pm on two of them, and even earlier on Sunday. Therefore, I have no reason to go there to enjoy what should be the cool bar scene. (Setting aside its atrocious beer selection.) 

As much as I initially liked the concept of the Duce as described by its owners in the media, it has been poorly executed from what I've seen so far. Get rid of the anti-Dbacks status, create a better bar situation for people to enjoy in terms of drink selection and hours, and it might stand a chance in the long run.",2010-09-01 16:39:46

Price is tad bit more expensive compared to other places ($9 for M, $11 for L)
 
Reason why I gave a three star is because of their service. They seem to be nice people but I don't think they're attentive enough. They never came over to check up on us nor filled our water initiatively. Had to wave the waiter down multiple times to get our waters refilled.

Appetizer - We started off with a seafood platter, which included things like crab, lobster, ceviche, raw oysters, and prawn.  Everything on that plate was beyond fresh and delicious.  The crab was SWEET and I'm not usually an oyster fan but this oyster was delicious.  

Main - My main was the lobster pot pie, apparently a signature favourite.  And I can definitely see why!  The lobster pot pie is a pastry filled with a whole lobster, vegetables, and a creamy sauce to compliment it.  They bring out the pie in front of you and slice the top of the pie (shell) and use it as a base on your plate.  Then they delicately arrange the pieces of lobster and vegetables on your plate.  At the end, it is absolutely beautiful and I can see someone has already posted a photo of it on Yelp.  It tasted as beautiful as it looked.  

My friend had a the filet steak cooked to medium rare and that was also very juicy, tender, and delicious as well.  

I was way too full for dessert by the end but I did order a Blue Lagoon drink at the beginning.  They went out of their way to find the recipe for the drink.  It was a great drink but unfortunately, I wasn't feeling very well that night (recovering from a flu/cold) so I barely touched the drink.

The food took a little longer than I wanted for it to come - there were a table of 10-11 of us that night so I'm not sure if they just wanted everything to come together or what the story was.

There were issues making the reservation and I had to call multiple times to be sure everything was confirmed. I knew they had another group that night but was assured it wouldn't affect the service. When we arrived, the hostess said they were about to give our table away because they had it in their system incorrectly. 

We had some of the most laughably bad service I have ever experienced. I would hope that any restaurant would put one of their more competent servers on a table of almost 20 people. It wasn't a busy night - the restaurant was half empty.

It took forever for food/drinks to come out. When orders eventually came out, the server would wander aimlessly around the table asking ""did someone order the ___."" If an order was dropped off at the table, it was not in front of the person who ordered it. It was like musical chairs trying to pass drinks/meals to the right person. Also - they were out of clean water glasses. 

Our server kept assuming items she was carrying out were extra, giving it to someone else at the table saying ""Must be extra, I guess you can have it for free."" This happened with my drink, which ended up being passed down to me from the other end of the table after she 'gave it away' to someone else. My meal was also given to the wrong person. This happened to the majority of us. 

Although we all ordered at the same time, meals came out sporadically... some 30+ minutes after the majority of the table had their food. One person in our group didn't get his meal until 40 minutes after everyone else. Our server needed constant reminding that people that were still missing meals, even 15-20 minutes after the first meals started coming out. 

After 20 minutes of people having their food sit out and get cold, we started eating - sharing food with the people whose meals hadn't shown up. Items that weren't being delivered weren't complicated meals - they were basic salads and sandwiches. 

Even though the service was a total nightmare, the restaurant staff was completely unapologetic. We expected an explanation for why the service was so bad, but never got one. They also didn't offer to discount any of the food/drinks. 

I wanted to complain at the time, but didn't want to make a scene (and my boyfriend asked me not to). I was mortified to have planned the event and have the dinner be such a mess. 

Added bonus? The bathrooms were disgusting - there was blood on the toilet in one stall and tons of TP with blood on it overflowing out of the trash can. No TP in the stalls. Unreal.",2015-01-08 02:57:59

As a local, it's pretty cool getting excited about something touristy or new or in this case, unknown.  The Mermaid Lounge is found in the Silverton Casino, just a little south of the main strip, and lives up to its name in a surprising way.

There is a beautiful aquarium just outside the restaurant, with plenty of fish, manta rays, and... an actual swimming, smiling mermaid.

While it's not a modern discovery of science, the fully underwater girl dressed as a mermaid swims up to you, poses for pictures (between the tank glass), and admittedly, it's a very novel and cool effect.  The girl's a good sport, making sure that camera hungry folk get a good shot or two before popping her breathing apparatus back in.

The restaurant itself is quite pretty, with chairs named after famous fish folk (Ariel, Shamu, etc), and behind the bar is a tank of jellyfish that have neon lights flickering around them, making their translucent bodies change color.  Beautiful and creepy all at once.

The first server girl we ran into was a little stand-offish, but our main server was very friendly and attentive.  Food and drinks here are reasonably cheap (less than $10 for most meals, and the same for drinks).  I tried the ahi tuna wrap, and it was quite tasty (and a little spicy).

The Silverton is a little out of the way from the Strip, but this is a very cool bar, and worth the extra effort to get over there.  The aquarium is awesome, and there is a small alcove that when walking in, gives you a brief sensation that you are actually walking into the aquarium's water.  It's an interesting effect in itself.

Seriously, though.  How often can you claim that you're able to mermaid watch while sipping drinks with friends?",2009-03-16 01:35:36

My friend and I were in town visiting with family and just happened to be in the Metro Center area. We decided we felt like hitting a steakhouse and on the perimeter of the mall there were three in a row near I-17. Since this place was recommended by a co-worker of one of my family members, it won out. We checked Yelp! and noticed it had 3 1/2 stars, so my expectations were somewhat tempered, but we went ahead anyway.

What a pleasant surprise! We were immediately acknowledged by the host with a big smile and, even though the place was pretty busy, were immediately led to a booth. 

Now it is loud in there, but we very much enjoyed the atmosphere! It was lively and festive..very upbeat! Our waitress came out and asked if it was our first visit and answered a ton of questions regarding menu items and hooked up our drinks right away. She was very personable and engaging. We were already impressed with the service level at this point and now were anxious to check out the food!

I ordered the 11 oz. sirloin steak with a caesar salad and mashed potatoes(14.99). The steak was so thick and juicy, cooked perfectly to the medium rare I love! 

My friend ordered a large porterhouse T-Bone steak (24.99) which was huge! I was jealous! I'll have to grab that next time!

My other friend grabbed the ""Road Kill"" (14.99) (sounds appetizing, doesn't it? lol), which is a 10 oz. chop steak smothered with saut√©ed onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, and jack cheese. He was able to add a side of ribs and a bowl of chili to that as well. 

It was fantastic how they staggered the dishes! First we had the salads and the chili. Shortly after finishing those dishes, out came the main dishes! It was just perfectly timed! Everybody at the table was raving about how great the food tasted!

All the while, the staff would announce when a member of the military was in the restaurant or when someone had a birthday! They would than lead the whole place into a Yee-Haw!! to celebrate! lol We got a kick out of it! It was fun! Than near the end of our meal the staff came out and did a whole sing-dance-line dance routine. We were really enjoying the atmosphere! I've read other reviewers complain about these things, and I say....shut the hell up! Its called TEXAS ROADHOUSE! What did you expect?? Miserable pricks...

On top of all that, as we were getting ready to leave, the manager approached us and acknowledged it was our first visit, thanked us, and presented us with a complimentary bag of peanuts. I know it was just a bag of peanuts, but I was really impressed! It was a class move and it just sealed the 5 star deal for me!

So to re-cap: Great service, great food, fun and festive atmosphere...all at an insanely affordable price! How can you lose??? Get down here and check this place out! You won't regret it!

First off - love their side dishes. They give you a ton! They gave us kimchi, tofu, bean sprouts, peanuts, and pickled radish. All of the side dishes were good - we finished them all and got seconds of everything.

We were really hungry after climbing so we ordered more than we would typically eat. We shared everything and ordered the steamed dumplings (super good, solid starter), one of their combo meals of soon tofu and spicy bbq pork, and bulgolgi on rice. Everything came in a stone pot or sizzling plate and it was extremely flavourful and filling - and hot to the last bite! Our favourite was the spicy bbq pork. The soon tofu is definitely solid as well. 

The bulgolgi on rice was good but a little dry (wouldn't get it again).

Really solid meal for three people but it was a little expensive. We initially had wanted to order the bibimbap or the kimchi fried rice but both were $15 (which is kinda expensive) and it was much more economical to get their combo meal.

A few of us yelpers came here after an elite event for a late night snack. Being in a big group I did get to try a few of their desserts and I did enjoy most of them. For my self I ordered the glutinous rice balls, one of my favourite Chinese desserts. The rice balls were quite big and draped with a generous portion of peanuts, they were pretty delicious. The dish that surprised me most was the tofu dessert which was very silky, and had a great texture. The tofu was served with some syrup to make it sweet; I would definitely order this again. 

If you look in the far end of this restaurant you will see a giant gold contraption that looks like it could house a genie, this is used to make turtle essence jelly which I believe this place specializes in. I gave the turtle jelly a try, I've had the dish before and have never been a fan, it is way too bitter for my palate and the copious amount of fruit it is served with is still not enough to balance it out. However this version of turtle essence was less bitter than the previous ones I've had.  

The restaurant itself is quite modest, and would be a good place to come post dinner for a light dessert. The menu has a wide range of items that includes a selection of bubble teas. If you are a novice to the world of Chinese dessert than you will likely require an Asian friend to help you out. All in all I had a pleasant experience, I would not go out of my way to come here but if I were in the area I might pop in for some tofu dessert (I never thought in a million years that I would utter those words).",2013-02-05 16:22:30

The performances do a very good job of evoking emotion and whenever I listen to the CD, I think of the acts I saw. The stage is amazing, performing on a vertical platform at most times!! Talk about intense!! The performers are very good at what they do and there is no other cirque show like this one!! Don't sit too close to the stage as the vertical platform they perform on is HUGE and if you sit too close, your neck will probably ache by the end of the show from having to look up most of the time.

The heaven and hell pot is called yin yang and you can get that by itself also! The conveyer belt is CONSTANTLY packed with food and restocked so you don't have to wait forever which is a problem I've had in the past.

Moving on to the service, impeccable. One of the most considerate staff I've ever come across. They always came to refill all THREE of our broths and drinks.

Back on this location:

This drive-thru is INSANE in the mornings (7:30am-9:00am) and insane, I mean about a 15 minute wait. Although, you will get the random day that you can zip right through.  I blame the delays on people ordering the breakfast sandwiches. They are delicious; however, that is what makes it a 10-car backup (to McDonalds)!

But, I must admit I have NEVER been inside of this one!  I have always done the drive-thru and the time limit doesn't ALWAYS bother me, because I can check emails, etc. while waiting.  (haha!)

The Barista's are really nice and ALWAYS get my drink orders right.  Never had an issue with that and they have great recommendations on drinks.

Some of my favs:
- Grande, Non-Fat, No Whip, White Chocolate Mocha, or make it a Venti with an extra shot of Espresso.
- Venti, Iced, Non-Fat, No Whip, Unsweetened, Green Tea Latte (if its sweetened- its like crack!)
- Grande, Non-Fat, No Whip, Green Tea Frappuccino, add Protein Powder
- Venti Caramel Fraccuccino, No Whip
- Cocoa Cappuccino: I like this, except its not strong enough for me.

The Matcha Green Tea (which is used in the Latte and Frappuccino) is what really got me hooked.  You either love it or hate it and I became OBSESSED!

We got some seats at the bar and were greeted by the bartender right away. He was very nice and fast at crafting our beverages. We ordered 2 Moscow Mules, and they were ok. Nothing special. Well Vodka with some cheap ginger beer. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to Mules, so I can't hold this drink against them.

I would like to see what this place is about sometime. Based on the drink prices I am sure it will be a hefty bill, but that is ok as long as the food is good. 

The Ambiance: It has a very contemporary Japanese feel with almost a dance club kind of vibe. It was noisy at the bar and there was a lot of people.

To start off the server was pretty good and gave good service.  He seemed a bit busy but he handled it well.  He even put everything in carry out for me.  4/5 stars 

To start my meal I ordered a ceaser salad with dressing & meatball on the side. Salad was fresh,  lots of shaved cheese on top and meatball was awesome. 5/5 stars 

My pizza came out next and shortly after my bolognese came out also. OK the pizza that I ordered has extra smoked mozzarella on top of the already cheesy pizza.  Well the pizza was the most disappointing part of my meal,  I was actually really excited about getting this large pizza but I only ate ONE slice and was done.  It was NOT HOT.. Was NOT cheesy or melty.. Cheese did not pull apart when taken out. Everything on pizza seemed fresh but it just seems like the pizza was left out the oven for half an hour before serving me..  That's the best I can describe as far as how hot it was. Mediocre pizza...I've had better.  1/5 stars for the pizza.  

The next thing I ate was the bolognese.. Which I ate about 5 minutes after I ate my slice of pizza.  It was piping hot.. Steamed came out of it...  More than I can say about their pizza!!  It was fresh and looked good. As far as taste goes it was just alright.  Not bad ...not great either.  Just mediocre taste. Nothing amazing about it though.  3/5 stars. 

OK so I've told the waiter about the pizza and he offered to warm it up for me... But I was getting full off of the salad and one slice of pizza...and I still had the bolognese to go... So I declined. He said he would tell the kitchen about it. But nothing happened from it. No one came by to ask me about the pizza or what they can do....not even offer me a dessert or something..  Or to even take it off my bill.  So I pretty much paid for a pizza I didn't like.  My bill with tip and everything was almost $60! Will I ever come back to this place??  NO WAY.  there's plenty of Italian and pizza places to go to with better service and quality pizza. I give how they handled a mishap...  1/5 stars. 

The only reason I give this place a 2/5 stars at the end is the service from my waiter was good,  the salad & meatball was great and ambiance of the place looked good..sorry but I really wanted to like this place and come back more often cause it's so close to home...

This is a converted old department store named ""Hanny's"". Hey, what a good idea for the name! 

It's clean, hip, spacious and fun. I'm a sucker for a fresh flower and candle on my table, too. I once said if I lived in a giant warehouse-like house, this would be exactly how I would decorate. The seats are chic and even recline. It shocked me at first and I thought the booth was broken. There are two floors and a staircase up to a DJ stand on the upper wall. Cool. If you want the pants scared off of you go check out the old elevator shaft to the back with a glass bottom. It's a good time! The bathrooms might be the coolest part. Trust me here and hit them up.

I had the dragon roll and another roll with salmon (forgot the name) and they were both good but not amazing. And both were more than $10, so the value isn't really there. I appreciate that the rolls weren't loaded with rice like they are at AYCE sushi places. My mom and brother got things off the Chinese menu - a spicy lamb dish, a spicy tofu dish, and another rice noodle dish with beef. I ate some of their food as well and wasn't really blown away by it. Maybe because I'm used to eating Chinese food all the time at home? The spice level was extremely tolerable, surprisingly. Nowhere near as spicy as the food I had when visiting the actual Sichuan Province in China. Everything was really flavorful but it was a little too much.

On this occasion, I shared a half buffalo chicken and half sweet pig pizza. I enjoy the texture of the pan pizza, but they no longer serve them in the pan, which was a disappointment. Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry, but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better. Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasn't the same. I didn't really enjoy either pizza flavor either. I've had both before and they were ok, but this time I was completely underwhelmed. The pizza just didn't seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either. 

I did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea. I'm always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea. The service was ok as well. Our server was friendly, but she wasn't very quick with the refills, so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have liked.

I try not to eat barbecue too often...my doctor is on me about cholesterol, etc., so I try to be good, as much as can, but sometimes you just can't resist and this is that day.
I have been going to Kinfolk's for the past few years and I think it is one of the top 2 barbecue joints in the Phoenix area.
Today I had the standard...pulled pork sandwich, fries and quart mason jar full of coca dieta...wow did that taste great!
The pork is tender and juicy, very smokey (no parboiled fake barbecue here). The sauces are homemade and extremely flavorful. The hot is not so hot that drowns the flavor out, the sweet isn't so sweet that it drowns out he vinegar bite...just great stuff!
I have had the pork ribs, the chicken, the brisket and the beef ribs. I agree with another reviewer that beef ribs could use a little something...the only place I have ever found beef ribs done right is Kansas City...but I digress.
The sides are terrific, the beans, the slaw, the fries are all very tasty and the only problem is that there is just too much food (I ended up bringing home 1/2 my sandwich again today).
The prices are really very good...it seem like the price for sandwich or a rack of ribs is the same as some other places (Honey Bears, etc.), but the portions are so much larger, so I think it's a bargain.

Pork belly buns - great! Seasoned perfectly not bland and the pork belly was nice and tender. Moist not dry.

Duck Noodle Soup - very good! The duck was delicious and super plumped. They give you a good portion of duck with your noodles too. The noodles is not the typical thin egg noodle but the thicker egg noodles more like chow mein but still very good. Broth was seasoned nicely tho I'm a saltier eater so I did add a little more soy sauce and hot chili oil 

Wonton - Ok. Meat was a little bland. Not the typical small wontons I like that usually goes with wonton noodle soup

While I really do appreciate them taking up that challenge (it shows moxie!), I'm afraid they for me at least, they're off by a couple. 

Now I don't usually venture into the East End but we have some friends there who just welcomed a baby girl and the one condition they set for visiting baby was that we bring food! Hey, who can blame them? They certainly don't have time to cook for us! So lazy me, not wanting to cook, is on the look out for a convenient take out option that accommodates the vegetarian (me) and the gluten & dairy intolerant (my wife). No Bull seemed to fit the bill and the owner was even good enough to reply to my concerns over the vegetarian gravy containing mushrooms (it doesn't) and whether or not there are any weird fillers in their burgers that may not agree with my wife (nope, no fillers). So we're off to a good start before we even walk in the door!

We get there and the place is smaller than I expected. Seating for only about 15-20 people or so but that's no worries considering I'm getting it to go. My wife orders hers with a gluten free bun...which they are out of. Awesome. So she's stuck getting a 'naked' burger on a bed of lettuce, which unless you're on a low-carb diet, is pretty depressing. Oh well, maybe the patty will be out of this world! Well, it wasn't. Flavour-wise it was just okay but the biggest problem she had was that the thing looked quite sickly...very thin and pale in fact, something that was only highlighted by having the thing bunless. Certainly not worth $5.50 for something that didn't look much better than a McDonald's patty. As for her fries they were...oh wait, they charged us for the fries and forgot to give them to us. So she had basically an unhealthy looking burger patty and nothing else. I normally check but we had a large order and were running late to get to our friends' place so I didn't inspect the order this time. Awesome.

As for mine, I went with their quinoa burger made up ""No Bull style"" (I think). It was much better than a burger made out of quinoa has any right to be but decidedly middle of the pack when judged against other veggie burgers I've had (and I've had plenty). I did enjoy the fixin's (BBQ sauce, sauteed onions, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and cheese) but $7.00? No, just no. Not even close. Their poutine, thankfully, was quite good and even a small at $5.50 is pretty substantial and they didn't scrimp on the cheese curds which is nice. Good fries and gravy and if the curd isn't the best, I could forgive that based on the generous amount they heaped on. 

So I'm giving them a pass but it's not the five stars that they aspired to and really not close. I started off with pretty high expectation but they really didn't come close to meeting them, sadly. It's a shame because it really does seem as though they're trying hard to do everything right. The service was very friendly, they make checking in on Yelp worth your while (do so before you order!), they (ostensibly) have options for people with all sorts of dietary restrictions and it just seems like a cool place all around. But it was too expensive for what you're getting and the fact that we had to stop at McDonald's for fries later because my wife was still hungry doesn't help their cause.

If I'm ever visiting my few friends in that area I feel like I want to give them another shot but I'm really not there that often and there are plenty of other neat places in the area that I'd be inclined to try before I go back to No Bull Burgers. Certainly not bad by any stretch but really quite a bit of a disappointment.",2015-07-07 18:07:28

This cute and minimal shop offers crepes, shortbread cookies and selective array of little cakes. Don't be mistaken by their size, these babies pack in a lot of flavor and texture within the first bite. 

I bought the Turtle tart, Lemon tart and the Earl. All of them were presented neatly in the display and they were even taped to the bottom of my take-home box so they remained in tact and pretty as in store by the time I got home. 

The Earl was a dream. This was an earl grey chocolate mouse with cookie base. However, my favorite was the Lemon tart. This must be the best lemon tart I've had in the city. It was tangy and fresh with a buttery crust and marshmellow topping. I was actually a bit sad when I finished my last bite haha.

I didn't try the Turtle tart, but I imagined it was just as good as the others since my boyfriend finished the whole thing without breathing.

Many times the cabin personnel is very funny and creative when making announcements, which creates a great atmosphere in the cabin.  Here are some of the other things that make Southwest the best: two pieces of check-in luggage at NO charge, no cancelation fees (you can even neglect to show up and call them after you were supposed to fly and get full credit), full credit to use towards future travel (and I mean FULL credit, not a single dollar extra charge), a great app. and you can choose to receive text messages with flight information, no blackout dates for reward travel.

I am sure what I went  through isn't normal for the masses that stay here. I just stayed the wrong week apparently. 

The hotel itself is in a great location and very well maintained and professionally staffed. However during my 4 nights at this hotel I didn't sleep much. It seems some nights there was construction or banging going on and other nights hotel guests were fighting in the hallway. The night of the argument in the hallway the hotel responded fairly quick. I didn't call or complain I was tired. It seemed the arguing last a few minutes in the hallway before I heard the intervention. 

My biggest complaint - my thermostat didn't work properly. The bed was ok but I don't blame them directly. Out of all the hotels I have stayed in while visiting Toronto I have only found one hotel bed that doesn't hurt my back. The room itself was nice and roomy.

My co-workers and I walked up on the wrong side of the cafe and came through the patio area.  Normally, I don't think this would have been a problem, however this night they had the majority of the patio roped off for a private function and we looked like we were trying to crash it.  Oops.  No harm done, they still let us into the restaurant.

While waiting for everyone in the group to arrive, the two girls at the hostess stand were watching us with little to no expression on their face.  I felt a little uncomfortable, they were not friendly and welcoming by any means, but they eventually sat us none the less and our service was great from there out.  We decided to sit inside as it was a little warm outside.

The server was nice and even joked around with us a bit.  I ordered the Orange Beso margarita.  It was good, since it was made with vodka instead of tequila, it wasn't quite a margarita for me, but hey, it tasted good.  Since they drop off the shaker so you can refill your own, it was the margarita that seemed to never end.  That made me happy!

Plenty of other people have mentioned the cool assortment of chips and the great salsa so I won't get into details.  I just leave it that I loved both!

For my meal I ordered the Black & Blue quesadilla.  It sure was yummy!  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and as I've mentioned in many other reviews, the right amount of blue cheese is always a winner in my book.  This quesadilla was right on the money, not overpowering with the blue cheese.  I ended up taking half of it home.

As plenty of other reviewers have mentioned, the white chocolate tamale was great finish for the meal.  I'm not so big on desserts, but I usually crave a bite or two of sweet to finish lunch or dinner and this did the trick!

We went on a Monday morning, and it was pretty empty when we first got there (around 9:30am), which is what we basically expected. However, a half hour later, we were very surprised to see the place completely packed with some people waiting. CLEARLY, this place is THAT good if it's full on a weekday! 

I had a hard time ordering because the menu is HUGE and everything looks delicious! Interestingly enough, I ended up ordering one of the few items that does NOT come with pancakes. They don't sell them a la cart either, you have to get 3 of them, which kind of stinks, but is understandable. I had the huevos rancheros (beans, with eggs- i got them scrambled and white, their green chili, cheese and avocado). Oh my goodness, was this dish DELISH!! I didn't even touch the tortilla it came with because of how TASTY the dish was and how occupied I was with eating it. Usually, I pour a ton of hot sauce on whatever breakfast egg dish I am eating, but their green chili sauce was so flavorful and had a nice kick to it, that I didn't need to! The dish came with their home fries and I added cheese and, holy moly, were the potatoes AMAZING. At the beginning of the meal, I said to myself, ""I'll only have a bite or two of the potatoes"" to save calories. Yeah, that did not work out as well as I had hoped once I tasted the potatoes. They were basically all gone by the end of the meal.

To drink, I ordered the coffee, and the waitress was pretty good about refilling when it was close to being empty. The service was okay. We did have to flag ours waitress down a few times to get things since she wasn't coming by often, but overall she seemed friendly, just also seemed a bit inpatient. 

As far as pricing goes, it's decently priced, but every little change. coffee (don't think plain coffee should cost close to 3 dollars), etc starts tacking on the dollars really fast. And suddenly, your once 10 dollar bill is no longer that low.

Pan fried seafood noodles:  true to tradition, the edges of the egg noodles are delicate crispy and soft where the sauce meets the noodle.  Plenty of seafood toppings though I think there should be a few more shrimps.

Long clams (razor clams) - I really do not know any place that has this and it is a must have.  Cooked just right and not rubber and the right spices here.

Live lobster made your way!  Ginger and scallions or the salt and pepper method with a reasonable price based on size is also a must here.

Fresh steamed fish, also live from the tank!  Nothing beats fresh.

Our latest visit to Bier Markt for a weekday lunch turned out to be nothing else but an expensive disappointment. 
Although I have been to Bier Markt twice before, this last experience took me by surprise as to how things changed for the worse. 
Upon our arrival for a 1:30pm weekday lunch, we were seated upstairs to a very small, uncomfortable table, in a very dark sector. Quite depressing. I suppose the bright big TV and the blasting terrible music was the only thing that kept that sector lively. 

While looking around, I've noticed that there was another sector upstairs with windows and far more spacious and better ambience. Sadly, we paid the unexpected consequences of having a worse waiter service. 

Shortly after we sat down, our waiter arrived. So far things are going OK. Right away we ordered our meals. Mussels in a sauce and a chicken burger with fries. We were a table of two and both times our waiter was quite pushy in offering us sweet potato fries instead for $1.00 extra. Of course that an extra dollar for his tip. We said, no. 

Since we arrived for a late lunch at 1:30pm, we are quite hungry. So our 45 minute wait for mussels and a chicken burger was not sitting well for either one of us. Finally our meals have arrived. Not once did our waiter took the time to apologize till I very kindly mentioned the such long wait. His response and I quote ""Oh sorry, our kitchen staff had gone on break when I placed in your order, I'm sorry about that""  Somehow my appetite was being replaced by frustration. As soon as we took a bite of our meal, both of our fries were cold and soggy. The mussels were warm-ish. My sandwich, well the bread was rubbery, the chicken was cooked till dry as sand paper. Again, I politely called our waiter and mentioned the fries. He said, oh sorry about that. Let me get you another batch. Soon after our waiter returns to our table and informs us that the fries will take about 5 minutes since they didn't have a batch made. So we waited, yet again!
Finally,y we finished our meal. I clearly indicated to our waiter that we were not pleased with our meal and the long wait. He simply said ""I'm sorry for that."" The apology and the service both felt quite cold, short, and very unprofessional for a simple lunch of two people with one beer that costed $55.00",2017-05-05 20:28:43

VZyaerecviFRavkN-vWvvg,YIVBjffQUJdzF03H_H4zOA,xvcGZGoLwWpmDMMY1VN-OA,3,3,1,2,"I overheard the manager wondering aloud why the place wasn't busy for happy hour, while Styx's ""Mr. Roboto"" blasted throughout the restaurant and its campy video played on the TVs.  That might have something to do with it. Also the fact that ""happy hour"" consists of a special on coors light and one other beer, as well as ""special"" prices on food--meaning, much smaller portions of certain appetizers. Happy hour here is a bummer. 

Otherwise, the place is pretty good. It has above average food for its pub-type setting and a wide-ranging menu. Something for everybody. Service (other than the high school-age hostesses who will robotically ask you five steps into taking you to the WORST table in the place ""how are you today?"" which for some reason irritates the hell out of me) is usually efficient and friendly. Though the servers seem bummed the place isn't more busy.  They have a wide selection of craft beer on tap--expensive craft beer that is--and a solid wine list with options well beyond what you'd expect.  The prices are a bit high though comparable to others in the area like Kona, Yard House, Culinary Dropout, etc. 

So this is a middling, three star review. It's worth a try but has some drawbacks--music and specials being the biggest suspects. The location tucked away from other similar places doesn't help. It's been pretty empty in the times I've been (lunch, happy hour, dinner), and of their two bars the more comfortable one--the pub-style bar at the front--is regularly closed or reserved for private parties.  I know there's a wildly successful outlet at Tempe Marketplace and I bet that the company figured the same formula would pack 'em in here in Old Town. However, the competition here is pretty stiff. I have to wonder how long this place will last without some changes. However, despite six months of being open they have yet to remedy some of the bigger problems so maybe the needed changes won't happen. They cut the hours a bit probably due to massive overhead but that's not the problem. Make it a true pub (open the front bar) and offer some real specials (across-the-board discounts) and cut out the Styx, and they might be on to something that will work here in Scottsdale.",2015-09-02 18:11:19

We headed in on Friday afternoon and while the place wasn't full when we arrived, there wasn't a table open by the end of our visit! If you arrive before 3pm, the $5 fee to play games is waived.

We loved everything about this place! It is super welcoming to all levels of board game players--from the very obsessed to the person who was dragged along. We saw a group playing a classic American board game (think Monopoly), an older couple learning how to play Ticket to Ride for the first time, and others getting into more serious board games. If you have any interest at all in playing board games, there is something for you at Tabletop. They have an impressive selection of over 1,000 games all categorized and labeled, so they are very easy to find or select something new based on what you love. They have a shelf dedicated with games for the kiddos too. They also have a Staff Picks section, which included many of our favorites or games that were on my boyfriend's list of next games to play. 

They offer some food--small bites, sandwiches, and smoothies. They also have coffee and about five different beers on tap. We didn't try the food, but we found the beer selection to be adequate. The guy who was serving had two roles--serving drinks/food and also explaining and helping to the set up our board game selection. We went with Machi Koro for most of our visit, and we also tried Citadels. The guy was not overbearing at all, and it is really nice to have someone explain the rules to you the first time you play a game.

Another thing that Tabletop got right is the ambiance. Board games in the past have been labeled ""nerdy"" or other places really try to push the ""geek"" culture. Tabletop is anything but that. You feel like you are in a very trendy, vintagey cafe, perfect for a hipster. They do have some geek references, but overall they tastefully included board game culture references like the meeple restroom signs. They also have a maker space in the back area, where they seem to host monthly workshops.

They do have the huge weight lifting section separated from the cardio and minor work out machines, which was nice- helped a bit.

They were offering a special though $5 enrollment fee with a- I believe $10 or $20 a month no contract, which was nice, but It was August and a lot of gyms start deals like this in the late summer months as the gym memberships decline from the start of the new year.

I've been a customer since the days it was a tiny, dark hole-in-the-wall eatery (before the first renovation at the recently burned down historical building on Gould St.).  A good friend of mine knows the owner and it was one of our favourite Thai food places for a bite.  The reason they had one of the busiest and best reputation for years was they actually had cooks from Thailand and he used the most expensive flour for his spring rolls (ever wonder why they weren't greasy and dripping in oil like other places serving spring rolls?).  The flour was extremely light and didn't hold much oil when fried and it made them crispy.  I was eager to try the new place.  The first time I stopped by and the line up was out the door and down the stairs spilling onto the street (it was about 2 weeks after re-opening at the new location) so we decided to eat elsewhere and come back another day.  The second attempt a few weeks later was successful as there was no lineup at prime time.  That may have been a mixed blessing... perhaps others shared the same experience as I did?

The service: We were seated immediately but after 10 minutes, no wait staff or anyone to even take our order.  This was not good as the old staff were excellent, very attentive, fast, courteous and easy on the eyes (at least the females were for me).  We were seated right near the door and wait staff had to pass by us to get to the kitchen (several did but we didn't know who was our server).  I was ready to get up and leave when a server asked us if we needed something... I said with a hint of sarcasm ""water would be nice and someone to take our order.""  She was polite and said she wasn't our server and he should be here any moment.  She brings us a glass of water and he finally showed up a minute later.  He was not apologetic, quite blunt and looked like he was doing us a favour to take our order (ah, typical mainlander... being Chinese I can say that).  The food took forever to arrive... the old place was 5-10 minutes tops and this was closer to 15-20 minutes.  I was wondering if they forgotten our order? They could have at least brought the spring roll appetizers first.  Nothing.  We had finished our water and not even a refill.  In my head, the tip was dropping by the minute.

The food: After about 20 minutes, our food finally arrives.  My friend order phad thai and I ordered mango chicken on rice.  I'm not sure if they still employ the same Thai cooks but the first thing I noticed was the spring rolls were a bit more oily than I recall at the old location... perhaps it's my memory that is failing me since it took them a while to re-open.  My mango chicken tasted good, portions were as I remembered and medium spice done right just like the good old days :)  At least that part didn't disappoint.  While eating, my friend and I chatted about the operation noticing there was more seating and there were empty spots which was rare at the old place.  Our delay in getting our meals may have been the kitchen staff not being able to cook as fast to accommodate the larger seating capacity.  We also noticed some guy, who looked like he was in charge, standing around and the owner was absent which was rare (did he sell out or did he actually take time off??).  Not sure but I'll need to come back to test these theories.

The verdict: I would usually give them a 4-5 star rating but my return here was a tad disappointing so a 3 star outing this time.  They have made improvements in the size, seating and fancier decor but I feel they sacrificed service and quality resulting from their expansion.  The prices went up a bit too (about a dollar a dish) which didn't make a huge difference but it makes you think about value compared to the old place.  I'll definitely come back and we'll chat with the owner (if he's still here) and give him some feedback about our experience.  If there is no lineups, I would think something is missing from their previous success formula.  Will be back for a review update here.",2011-07-06 15:32:34

We started with the Ahi Tuna Trio of Tacos. They were yum and easy to eat with the light jicama shells. They had all the right flavors going on. This dish might have been a little pricy for what it was but was delicious anyway.

For dinner I had the Jade Pesto Halibut. It was interesting and different with the cilantro pesto and curry sauce. They gave me a generous portion of halibut that wasn't seared but was sweet, flaky and moist. All the vegetables and black rice were tasty too. I thought this was very much worth the $23.00 because nice halibut dinners at other places usually run $30-34 out so this evens out the appetizer we had.

My husband had the Cola Braised Pork. Overall he was very happy with his dinner. I didn't taste the potatoes but my husband said for him they were boarder line salty and he said for me they'd be much too salty.

The only thing slightly odd was the bread service. We saw all the other tables getting bread and we didn't get any so we inquired about that. We were told they don't serve it unless you ask for it.

My husband took me here for my birthday this year and not one dish we ordered disappointed us. The menu at Legume changes daily so anything I mention in this review may never be featured again, who knows. With a constantly changing menu, it really goes to show that their ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is nice - intimate and romantic, but it's also rather simple. No hip modern decor that you'd find at other fancy restaurants in Pittsburgh. In fact, it reminded me of an old banquet hall that they spruced up a tad and turned it into a restaurant. Onto the food. OH MY GOD, I was in heaven. I ordered a corn soup with corn fritters to start. This soup is the best soup I've had. The soup was sweet, but it had a drizzle of chili oil, giving it some spice. And the corn fritters gave it texture and crunch. The entrees we ordered were also out of this world. He ordered a roasted chicken dish and I ordered a steak dish. They were quite simple in the description of ingredients, but Legume perfected them. How? I don't know and I wish I did! Perhaps it's the simplicity in it all and its about the technique in the preparation, not the glitz and glam of fancy ingredients. The chicken and steak were so moist and buttery. The desserts were, again, out of this world. He ordered a chocolate dish and I ordered a cardamom creme br√ªl√©e. They were rich, but oh so simple. I really enjoy the simplistic approach Legume takes on its atmosphere, as well as its food. It goes to show that you don't need all the frills for a successful dining experience.",2016-01-09 16:10:41

There has been some discussion on Facebook about if their buns are vegan or not, but I stopped by for some emergency fries (I was starving) a week ago and someone who seemed like an owner or manager told me the buns are vegan. As a result, I went back to try the burger this week!

The restaurant offers a variety of toppings, but as a vegan I just started with the ""classic"" minus cheese and dressing. The server was great about making suggestions, so I added grilled onions, ketchup and mustard. I was also clear with her that I'm vegan, and she said she'd mark the ticket so they'd cook it on a clean grill. I also ordered fries.

The burger was delicious! I had it cooked well done, but it was still pink because, well, it's not meat! It was nice and warm inside, but perfectly grilled outside. I've had the Beyond Burger at home before and thought it was just okay, but having it professionally grilled made a big difference! All the toppings were good. The grilled onions were thin and flavorful, and a generous portion. I should have asked for extra pickles, as there were only a couple. The bun was warm and soft. I do have a bit of doubt on if it was vegan or not - it seemed a bit eggy. The fries are perfect. They're lightly coated in what I assume was corn starch, and fried to a crisp. 

The service was excellent! The server noticed that I was sharing with my husband, who arrived after me, and offered to have the kitchen split the burger. The food came out quickly, and the server brought an extra tray for us to divide the food.

The only thing stopping me from making this a five star review is that I'd like to see them add more vegan options i.e. vegan cheese and maybe some interesting sauces/aiolis? I was sad to have to stick to ketchup and mustard. If they did, I'd probably become a regular!",2018-02-25 21:10:58

We just wanted something hot and quick and were ready to chow down  

We had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant until we sat down...and then the confusion came in when we saw meat dishes on the menu.  Huh?!  Ohhh...mock meat dishes.  We ordered the shrimp dumplings (not particularly impressed...had a gummy like texture) the spring rolls which weren't bad, the vegetable fried rice (this was pretty interesting and unlike any other veggie fried rice I have had - more emphasis on the veggies and less on the fried!) and the crispy ""duck"" with the plum sauce.  I tried a few pieces and well....it's not duck.  I am not sure why a vegetarian place makes fake meat.  If people want vegetarian food, why make something that tastes like meat???

I only came by for drinks and dessert this time so I'll do another review of their food.  They've got really good drink specials for each day of the week. Tuesday was $4 Sapporo so we threw back a few too many on a work night. They have this really interesting concept of rotating taps, where they constantly switch out seasonal or special kegs of beer. It gets updated on a board in the back which is so cool! You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. 

I was initially set on giving them 4 stars but we managed to catch the end of the Jays game here, where the Jays won with a home run in the bottom of the 10th. The whole place erupted in cheer, and put us all in a really great mood so 5 stars it is!

They also have a very good cafe (more about the cafe, later in my review). Unlike many small casinos in Henderson, this casino looks new, modern, and inviting inside. They also seem to have installed a pretty good ventilation system, which does a good job in reducing a lot of the cigarette smoke. Now don't get me wrong, you can still smell the smoke occasionally (like all casinos), but it is not a lingering thick toxic cloud that suffocates you (like the Henderson Jokers Wild casino, and  the Skyline casino). I only have two complaints. First, the cafe is frequently crowded and there usually is a waiting list. But, I can't really fault them for that, because the waiting line is due to the fact the cafe serves very good food at really cheap prices (I recently had the prime rib dinner and it was great for cafe food, in which you can get the regular cut for $10 and the large cut for only $12...and shockingly, when you order the prime rib medium rare, they actually serve it that way...unlike most casino cafes, which serve everything medium to well done, no matter what you ask for). The second complaint I have is their rewards program. If you want to redeem your points for cash, or a store gift certificate, the redemption rate equates to about 1/100 of percent of total dollars wagered (most other casinos offer at least 1/10 of percent, or more). However, Rainbow does offer multiple points days (as most casinos do), so if you gamble on those days, you can get a competitive redemption rate. The other issue with their rewards program is, they only allow you to redeem your points for cash a few times a year, and only if your a higher level card member. Finally, unlike most casinos, Rainbow does not send you free play/cash in their monthly mailers (I am at their second highest card member  level, and I have never received any offers for free play or cash).

Then the delectable butternut squash soup - this was heavenly.  It was so smooth and had a subtle flavor to it that was complimented by the pears and I think blue cheese sorta of cream drizzled in.

As the entree I chose the salmon - it was cooked beyond perfection and not overly salted or flavored - it had all the right tastes throwing a party in my mouth.

Once our family and I got here, once inside the entrance, we were told we ""HAD TO"" take a photograph - all of us - by their photographer, and we could pick up the pictures later. None of us wanted to have our photos taken (not even the kids), nor had we any inclination to buy a photo of us (we looked horrid, just walking here from our hotel. We were so NOT in the mood). But we were forced to, so we did. That was our first cue that this place perhaps was not for us.

We walked around the dome to check out the various rides. They have a pretty good assortment of attractions. My kids chickened out of riding any of them, so we did not purchase wristbands. But man, was it packed there! Families and kids walking and running around. We nearly tripped on a few kids who got underfoot. Be forewarned.

Tip: we went online beforehand and found some discount coupons for the all-access wristbands (Google ""Las Vegas discounts"" and you will find). I think the coupons were for $4 or $5 dollars off each wristband. This is a moot point for us, as my kids didn't want to go on any rides, so I gave my coupons to a family waiting to get inside. 

Food-wise, they only sell amusement park fare (cotton candies and the like). Nothing looked or smelled even remotely appealing.

To say I was disappointed with this place is an understatement.  First off, the food was pretty good.  I don't have any complaints about the taste at all.  It's a play off of Malaysian street food, with an updated twist. The food was not the issue per say  

 First off, if you are hungry don't come here unless one of the following apply:
 - you have lots of money to spend because the portions are TINY
 - you already ate before hand and are just having some small bites with drinks
 - you plan on hitting up another place afterwards because you are still starving

We had to get something to eat afterwards because we were hungry.  I decided to go with the red chili wings, the laksa dumplings (the tiniest things I have ever seen) and a drink.  My bill came up to $40 incl tax and tip.  I'm a small person and I was still hungry! Sorry, but I don't know what Malaysian street this is supposed to be.the upper rich side?? 

I also tried the sliders and the chicken tacos that the table ordered...both good, but tiny once again.  Someone also ordered the roti/dhal dish.  It came in a bowl for the dhal and like 1 tiny roti that was cut up into 5 pieces...so basically a lot of left over dhal.  What a waste

Also, make sure you ask for a separate bill if you are in a larger group. I did so as soon as I sat down which was a good thing because the rest of the table got screwed when they asked for this later in the evening.  Everyone's bill was wrong....so it was a lot of handing over money to this person and that person to try and make things work. 

For a place to grab a drink and a small bite this is a great place, but since I don't live close by nor do I want to spend money here only to have to go somewhere else to get more food I think I will pass.n",2015-03-22 13:59:12

Despite being relatively simple, it was one of the best restaurant versions I've ever had.  The bread was wonderful (and stayed crisp the whole time!), the cheese was gooey and melty, and the oven-roasted tomatoes added a wonderful smokiness to the sandwich.

Coleslaw on the side to lighten things up, and I was a happy camper.  I ate the whole thing, and since I generally have only a moderate appetite, I think that shows wise portion sizes on the part of Park Bruges.  The sandwich was $9 with bacon, I believe $8 without.

I also got the ""side salad"" which was $7, and seemed expensive, but it was also enormous.  2 people could easily share this and each person's portion would still be larger than your usual ""side salad.""  I loved the sweet walnuts, and tangy cheese on top to keep the salad exciting.

Looked a bit cramped but I can handle that style of seating for good food.  The waiters brought out plates of flaming dishes and yelled ""OPAH!"" each time.  Not sure if anyone working there was actually Greek but it makes for a good show and adds some to the atmosphere of the place.

My roommate had the Rolled Baba sandwich, a veggie dish made with baba ghannouj.  She liked it a lot but I didn't try it so I'll take her word for it.

I had the lamb sheesh pita.  It was served with an ample portion of delicious meat and they were generous with the veggie toppings and yogurt sauce.  Fantastic sandwich.

The menu has a fine selection sides, salads, burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  They serve Greek beer and I think they have one from the Middle East as well.  One day, sooner than later, I'll venture back and dine in (even if it's a bit crowded) and take in the atmosphere and a great meal.

Saba's was very impressive all around.  It's on par with my two favorite locations in Tempe.  This place will be getting a lot of my eating out money.  If it wasn't for other favorite kebab locations in New York City, Philadelphia and Toronto that were a tad better I likely would have given Saba's a solid 5 stars.  It was that good.  Can't wait to go back.",2011-08-13 20:26:23

4j6x4m_ZThrz7NweekpNYw,AwyM03qzhwgyskBruurWQw,y0TTPR0K5iB4oMkgVUH1ig,3,0,0,0,"Pizza as a fast food concept, with a distinctive green and organic feel?  Sounds great, but consistency needs a bit more work at this newly opened business.

I've been in for lunch a number of times now and I can definitively say the service is quick and the wait is never long.  You order at the counter and then your meal is brought table side, while you help yourself to the beverage counter.  Parking is either street-side or in the Met Deck (both hazards worthy of their own review).   Assuming you get in the door, however,  the indoor and outdoor dining space is relatively clean and inviting.

Pizzas come with a choice or white of multi-grain crusts.  They are all generally made in a thin crust style, however.  There are a number of pre-defined combo pizzas and you can always make you own.  Prices are generally in line with other speciality pizza joints about town.  I have found, though, that the pizza is a bit inconsistent in its finish.  Sometimes it is a bit oblong, other times it is round.  Sometimes it is flat as a board, other times it has some nice air pockets in the crust.  Sometimes the crust is a bit more charred on the edges.  These all point to signs that more experience is needed in the kitchen, as you would expect at a brand new franchise.  

Aside from pizza, however, there are a number of salad options with dressings that I find very flavorful.  Dessert pie options are tempting, but just too much at the lunch hour.  I do, however, appreciate the Boylan's soda fountain.  It's fits well with the organic theme and the flavors are great.  Just know that there is no Coke and Pepsi coming from there, but the cola flavor is a nice alternative.

In all, this may not be a place to impress, but it is an acceptable casual eatery option that is a bit more health conscious than most other fast food neighbors.  With quick order to table times and a good number of options to pick from on the menu, it's a fine choice.  Hopefully with time comes a bit more consistency.",2012-10-17 21:21:47

I don't think I have ever had such Thai food. My friend Denise wouldn't shut up SEA for the rest of the trip. I actually had to convince her that we needed to explore the rest of Vegas, or we would have eaten every meal here.

We ordered a yummy cocktail, the pad thai and the panang curry. It was all perfect down to the white rice that came out sculpted into a little pyramid. Can I give SEA 6 stars?

Out of the 3 this might be my least favourite one. I'm a little in the middle with Tian Yuan, it's not exactly the worst but there's not the best. It's really just a so-so for me.

Like someone had said in their previous review, the first thing I realized as well upon entering was the smell. To me, it smelt like those old children's books that are made of what I would assume really hard cardboards? And surprise, that's what their menus are made of.

The menus were really great quality, wonderfully printed and easy to read. That I really appreciated. The place is a little small, but everything in this general shopping area is small. I was greeted with a friendly welcoming smile, so +1 there.

It's got everything you would find in a standard Asian dessert place, but here's the one thing I was hoping for when I walked in. There were no waffles! Either I didn't look hard enough or it really just wasn't there!! 

I ended up going for the house special brick toast w/mango ice cream. You do get your choice in ice cream. The fiance got a caramel cheesecake.

Naturally his came first because of course your just slicing up a big cake. It was nicely designed but the cheesecake itself was pretty ... Meh. I couldn't really tell if they made it their self. If you have gone to Cafe Princess, think of their cheesecake. It tastes pretty much on par.

My house special brick toast did take a while for it to come out, and though I don't think I really captured it's beauty with the picture I had taken, they really REALLYYYY put a lot of time and effort into it, which is why I gave this place an extra star. The insides were cut up into small little squares and stuffed back in, nice and toasted for that mango ice cream to absorb. Every single corner of the brick toast and the plate had fruits and a small squeeze of whipped cream. You can really tell they put it their all.

I've only had 1 brick toast in my past, and this one just really tasted like toast while the one I had from a while back was sweetened. To be honest I don't know the proper way of preparing a brick toast. Overall it was okay. I mean ... It was toast and ice cream.

I really like this place for the friendly people and very cutesy environment, but there's nothing really tugging at my heart strings to come back here. I ended up here because I was out at 1am looking for some sweets. And Tian closes at 2am on a Saturday.

I had paid with debit, so that's a good thing. A majority of Asian places don't offer that, and when they do, there's always some kind of limit. I was also offered to come back with a 10% discount card if I had paid cash. I may use it, I may not.",2015-09-28 04:15:31

Definitely coming back to this joint. I was told about their fried chicken and I'll have to try that another day. Maybe the next restaurant outing I'll go there instead of my usual Futo Buta. 

Not a fan of the ""private"" room. It's an area with no door right near the bathrooms. Aside from the onlookers, Someone popped their head in offering a slurry comment about a party while we were in the midst of discussing the book we read. Yea, next time I need a private room, I'll try a different spot.",2018-01-24 23:45:22

I got the California Eggs Benedict which is the usual Benedict but with cooked spinach, avocado and tomato. I replaced the tomato with Canadian bacon. It also came with a small side of home fries (cubed pan-fried potatoes).The Hollandaise sauce was thinner than I'm used to and had pepper instead of paprika but it was really good. The eggs were poached perfectly and the English muffin was toasted and very good. The fries were a little underdone for my tastes (not undercooked but not browned like I like) and were also seasoned with just salt and pepper - but they were pretty good. 
Overall, a very tasty breakfast. I think the plate with the added ham and a large glass of orange juice was under $15, so not bad for the quality and if you really love a great poached egg. They also have t-shirts with cool designs and the inside is very small but clean with super friendly, fast service. 
Only 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn't amazing. Thicken up the sauce, brown the potatoes and add a few more spices for that coveted 5th star.
Still, check it out when in the area!",2012-08-26 20:05:03

What I love about this place is that the burgers are super juicy and have a great flavor. Earlier today I had the Gold Standard burger and it was banging! Dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, aragula, and garlic-chive aioli. Oh Em Gee!! Flavor overload! The burger was so juicy, it was dripping (I get mine medium). The sweet potato fries is the best I've had. I love that it's perfectly crispy on the outside and comes sprinkled with salt. Yum!
Another favorite? The shakes! I don't always drink shakes, but when I do... I like them to have a double shot :) The drunken monkey, the campfire smores, and cookies n cream. All shakes are delicious. The cookies and cream has a huge ice-cream sandwich on top. 
I don't think there is anything you can order here and go wrong. You really don't need an appetizer, a burger, fries, AND shake will stuff you. I took half my burger and fries home.

you get a choice of a soup base, noodle type, 2 ""toppings"", and a free hot drink.
for a cold drink, it's an extra dollar and for a milk shake you add $2.
mango pudding is $1.75. it's like 2-3 spoonfuls. kinda small

for the $6 though, i left pretty full.

my order was japanese style thick pork soup, instant noodles, sliced lamb, dumpling, avocado milk shake and mango pudding.

the soup wasn't too bad, but i couldn't drink it all and usually i like to finish my soup after eating my noodles. just a tad salty.
instant noodles was instant noodles, always delicious. lol
sliced lamb. i think i only got 3 slices, but my friend got 4. otherwise the lamb was good.
the dumplings, were almost more like a meatball than a dumpling. only got 2 of those. would've preferred something more like boiled dumplings or fan friend dumplings.
i really like avocado shakes and make a pretty good one myself, so i'll be a bit picky with this one. i'm not sure what they used, whether it was like a milk or cream, or even vanilla ice cream maybe, but either way, it was a bit too creamy. the colour of the shake leaned more towards the white colour than a green avocado colour. this reflected in the flavour as well since the avocado was not the dominant flavour but the secondary flavour. so i tihnk that could be better.
the mango pudding is not your typical chinese styled mango pudding either. it's actually like pudding, not gelatinous like what you would typically expect from a mango ""pudding"". the flavour is pretty good, and has that real fruit taste too it, but the serving size is slightly small. i'd say increase the portion size to 50-100% more.

all in all though. pretty good. will come back to try some other combinations and flavours.",2015-10-23 01:56:57

 To be honest ,I've had better (this is not a knock against them, just been to a lot of Mexican restaurants), but I think it is very good. Definitely at least a 7 out of 10, even on a bad night. Chips and salsa is very good.

I really like Friday night live music In Mateo's, the bar side of Sylvias.  A band that plays there often, called Picoso, is a real treat!  They are made up of veteran musicians and music teachers, and do some great classic rock cover tunes, from Beatles to Santana. 

they have a nice out door seating area, Spanish tile and a fountain make it very esthetically pleasing and relaxing.

The Bad:

It takes forever to get your order taken.  I've been there probably 20 times, and we go through this every time.  We usually sit in the Mateo bar side.  The bartender and/or waitress takes forever to get us chips, or even to take our order.  They crawl for the drinks, too.  When in the restaurant side, you get faster service, but not by much.

Initially, I had a bit of a hard time finding the place, but it was bit easier to see once I located the parking lot behind it. There was plenty of seating inside and we were given water and a giant bowl of chips after we were seated. In terms of food, I literally cannot start talking about anything else before I rave about the salsa bar. There are literally 10+ selections of salsa from guacamole salsa to sesame salsa and more typical salsas like salsa verde. I went berserk getting a bunch of the salsas and tried a good deal of them. It also helped that they gave us a giant heaping pile of chips to try all the salsa with. 

In terms of actual food, I got the La Santisima Veggie taco and the Mexica Ahuacatl taco. My friend on the other hand had the 3 taco plate with rice and beans. Both of the tacos I ordered were guuureat though I did like the La Santisima Veggie taco a lot more than the Mexica Ahuacatl. I did steal a bite of my friend's rice and beans and it was also super delicious! My friend enjoyed all 3 of his tacos (2 meat, 1 fish) even though his order was slightly incorrect.

I went during the afternoon, and the place was full.  Definitely a place you would take the family.  There are many old pictures hanging on the wall.  Looks like it has a lot of history.

I tried the following dishes:  buffalo wings, fried mushrooms, and the philly cheese steak.

The buffalo wings are good but I really never ate bad buffalo wings.  The fried mushrooms looked like it was covered in breadcrumbs then fried.  It was not special at all.  You just bite through the crunch crust then into the soggy, mussy mushroom.  There were no special flavor or taste to it.  It was served with marinara sauce.  

The Philly cheese steak came with a side of ruffle potato chips.  If you have ever tried Uncle Sam's Subs, you'll be extremely disappointed in the Philly cheese steak here.  The cheese steak wasn't flavorful or memorable.  It was a bit simple.  There wasn't any taste that made me want to make another bite.  It was simple and ok.  But if you were spoiled by Uncle Sam's, there is no comparison.

Conclusion:
Would I come back to this place?  Yes.  I want to give the pizza a try.  My companion recommended me to get it and the reviews on here says so too.  Would I order the buffalo wings again? Yes.  Fried Mushroom?  No.  Philly cheese steak?  No.  The only other deciding factor is it being in Monroeville and I have to deal with Monroeville traffic to get there.

I listened to the BS war stores about the tough scene that is being a security guard at Burlington Coat Factory.... These brave hearts' tales of their tough incidents inspired me...... to want to vomit.  They should be moved to a back room where they cannot embarrass themselves. 

Look, I know Burlington is a cheapo store for cheapo people but I have learned that I can still be cheap and shop in a safe and clean store. I have since used J.C. Penney and Macy's at the Galleria with immense delight and new found locality. Its just as cheap! And the employees are able to fake caring well and the merch is well displayed and cared for. Burlington Coat factory is right on the heels of Ross Dress for Less, another dump.",2014-11-03 19:45:04

If you are able to dine here AND get a window seat, it's a beautiful view of the city, especially at dinner right before sunset. The tower revolves and takes almost 1 hour to make a complete revolution.  The ambiance is nice and the staff is attentive.  It's not the most beautiful view I've ever seen from a tower but it's pretty nice and I would dine here again for that view. 

On wards to the food.  A dinner meal for 2 will easily run you over $100 CAD per person if not more.  Hubby had the 3 course prix fixe menu, $79 and I initially started off wanting to try the 3 course but by the end of the 2nd course which I couldn't finish as I was full and didn't like one of the cod servings so I stayed with 2 courses for $65. They do have an ala carte menu and I watched a couple of ladies way smaller than me consume a whole steak and lobster dinner which looked scrumptious.  I should have ordered off the ala carte instead.
If you want free access to go to the lower viewing level of the CN Tower after dinner, then you need to order minimally 2 courses for your meal.  The staff will show you the way (go down the stairs).  

I had the smoked salmon appetizer which was delicious with thin slices of salmon circuitously plated while you circle slowly around and around the city.  
My entree of Fogo Island (local) cod 3 ways was disappointing.  
One was a salt cod fritter with was OK, the cod belly with Yukon Gold potato gratin was the best tasting of the group and I did not like the pan-seared Fogo Island Cod with carrot puree , asparagus and mushrooms.  That cod tasted as if it was dehydrated or dried, then rehydrated before cooking.  I like fish but this dish made me wish I had ordered something else.

Hubby had the chowder which he said was OK but he really liked his prime rib 10, Alberta beef with sour cream, asparagus, au jus. He declined the horseradish. He paired it with a glass of Canadian miritage wine, $14 which was decent tasting. 
Interestingly, a lot of the wines on their list are from California (nothing but the best!).  His hazelnut torte was good but not memorable. He didn't like the crust which was a thick layered, hard cookie-type texture and prefers tarts made with puff pastry.  

The most amusing part of dining here is that if you have to run off to the bathroom and when you return, your dining partner has rotated off and is not where you left him.  I guess it's a good way to ditch a bad date if you were inclined to do so.  
The staff is acutely aware and no less than 2 persons came to my assistance when I am sure I had that befuddled look,  to guide you back to your seat.  That's good training on the part of management.",2016-06-19 15:41:47

Usually, I get breakfast when I go since it's early and I'm trying to beat the crowds at the market on a Saturday (dear lord, why did I go on a Saturday?!?). This past week I was late and went for lunch. Both are good enough, but there were also major issues in each circumstance.

Here's a rundown of both breakfast and lunch:

Breakfast: What you would expect in a good way, nothing outstanding and nothing bad. Last time I went I ordered waffles and they came out burned and rock hard. When I told the waitress she said, 'I didn't want to serve it to you because I saw it was burned, but I'm not allowed to question the chef.' WHAT?!? She took them back and off the bill and I got my typical eggs/hash browns. Everyone was nice enough about it, buuuuuut... ok, whatever.

Lunch: I ordered the ""My Big Greek Chicken Wrap"" Here is the exact description from their site and the menu:
""grilled chicken, romaine, diced tomatoes, feta, cucumbers, red onions, and kalamata olives tossed in Greek vinaigrette""
Let me be clear, it was good, HOWEVER, there were only 3 olives in the whole wrap, they weren't chopped up, left whole, and only about 2 tablespoons of chicken with a small smattering of cucumbers and tomatoes. I'm not even exaggerating. If you're going to give me what amounted to a salad wrap, albeit a tasty one, don't bill it as having chicken and don't charge me $10!!!!

I will never go back for lunch because of the above, especially since my husband got a corned beef sandwich and it was teeny tiny for what we paid and he left hungry. 

Stick with breakfast (not the waffles).",2018-03-07 17:46:23

Loved the black dragon roll, the banana roll (proper name now escapes me) is interesting and pretty damn delicious.  Followed by choice ice cream, fried banana in syrup. If you ask they will give all broccoli tempura (which when you are dining with a few people who only want the broccoli pieces in the vegetable tempura is a good thing).  

The service: has always been friendly and fast! If I do recall correctly they will split the bill (for larger groups) without any real complaint, and even offer to do this!

The atmosphere/decor: Clean, simple, nothing too fussy. I suppose there is a sort of 'diner' sort of feel to the place....I say this because the last time I sat in one of the small booths.

PROS:
Clean (Much more so than Sho-gun of Monroeville, due to being newer)
Great Sushi
Nice Staff
Full Bar Area & Nice Atmosphere

CONS:

VERY busy on weekends!
The potential to get ""stuck"" sitting with an a-hole is possible due to the seating around the hibachi grills.

DINNER SUGGESTIONS:
""Steak (Filet) & Shrimp Combo with Mushroom Appetizer""

The lines seem to get longer and longer everytime I go back.  It doesn't matter how early my party and I plan to get there, we always end up waiting 45 minutes to an hour.  One time, the line was so long we just decided to eat at Hash House a Go Go right next door.

I'm a fan of meats (like all buffet lovers should be) but for some reason the quality seems to fall short compared to the first time I ate there.  I can't exactly pinpoint it.  Something just seems off.

I've also noticed the selection is not as big as Wynn or Wicked Spoon.  Of course Buffets should be equally great in quality and quantity, so I can't complain.

It's still a great buffet but I just can't see myself going there anymore, because they can't get their line problem figured out.  The hardest thing for a hungry man to endure is waiting in an endless line, knowing that a few feet away lies a buffet.

This special is only valid if paid in cash, but it's an all day special which allows for a lot more flexibility in meet ups. We all want that early bird special, but we also always have that one person in our group that just can't get up in time (I'm guilty of that at times)

The food came out quite quickly. Overall the food didn't really wow me, but also was not bad. It's definitely a very solid ""good"" dim sum place for what your paying and getting. I would say a solid 3.5 stars. Its not as glamorous as other places, but also doesn't hurt the wallet.

It has the usual selection of dim sum fare, and did everything well enough that i could find little to no fault. 

The service was surprisingly good for a dim sum place. The waiters and the people handling the orders were quite synced up and friendly. 

I wouldn't hesitate to come back if i had a hankering for some good dim sum, but if your looking to impress some older asian parents you may want to look elsewhere, but also spend more too.",2017-04-23 21:09:33

The burger didn't have a ton of pork or bbq sauce on it, but I enjoyed it. The fries were battered and oily. I was disappointed with the chili mac. I thought it was going to be a thicker mac & cheese with some chili mixed in, but it was more like pasta with watery chili and a layer of cheese on top. It was heavy too. My stomach was none too pleased after all that grease...

Chicken definitely rivals Popeyes and is way better than KFC, has a good amount of spice. Everyone says the spaghetti is super sweet but I think it's not too bad as it still tastes savoury. It has some cheese and some small cuts of hot dog in it. The pies are deep fried and filled with peach mango that oozes out when you bite down. McD's apple pies have some competition.

1) the fish counter. Not only do you see locals of every ethnicity shopping there, but more often that not you'll see a chef looking for something a little different. And I don't mind being able to see my seafood move a bit before I take it home.

2) the frozen meats. The only place I've been able to find whole rabbit, but they have all the other less popular cuts and organs of pork/beef/etc.

3) the Goya aisle. I don't remember what the aisle is actually labeled as, but someone took some serious effort in organizing the Goya portion of it. Items are separated by country (and labeled) covering Columbia, Spain, Mexico, el Salvador, Peru, and more... So yes you can pick up some squid in their own ink, a jar of tender cactus, and a bucket of lard all while standing in the same spot. 

4) the bakery. Yum pork buns, rolled cakes, and bubble teas steps away from the BBQ end of the counter with ducks and pigs (closed on Tuesdays). 

5) the produce. Probably par with the other store's selection, but they get extra points here because all of it is labeled in English with the price printed on it. 

Of course this place has failed to refill a lot of its freezer sections and shelves over the last year or so, so there are a lot of empty spaces, but I like the selection here.

I don't live in the area, but I do work 10 minutes away so I've gone here once on my lunch break and another time after work. The chicken is amazing with breading almost identical to mochiko chicken. The garlic sauce is described as being ""miso garlic"" and isn't too overwhelming garlicy. They add chopped green onions to the top which give it a little bit of extra crunch and flavor. I may try the other items on the menu, but I have a feeling if I do I might say I should of gotten the garlic chicken because it's just that good. This place is legit because one of the times I came in most of the patrons eating looked like legit Hawaiians.

She was really craving noodles and decided to order Pork Pad Thai ($13). I was really wanting Chinese so I ordered the Kung Pao ($15) which came with chicken, bell peppers, peanuts, hot peppers and a brown spicy sauce. I also really love how their are different protein options to add to your dish (Tofu, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, Pork or Scallops). If you are not in the mood for General Tso's Chicken, swapping it out with some Tofu is an option and like I said early, options are key!

Mr. J ordered a black milk tea and it tasted like it was made from a mix. I had the mango and there wasn't a drop of tea in it. It was just a sugary mango juice with tapioca pearls. 
When our meals came out, there were a few other glaring issues:
- sweet dumpling sauce served with the soup dumplings. These are traditionally served with black vinegar and shredded ginger, by the way.
- the eggs in the ramen were overcooked and the yolks were a powdery gloop.

This place has been bookmarked on my Yelp app for a while, so I was excited to catch a last minute reservation and go with friends. The service was great. The staff are very attentive down to the small details. I love how on their cocktail menu, you can purchase a round of beers for the kitchen staff for $6. I also love how they have an option on the cocktail menu for the bar tender to make you a special drink based off of the flavors you like. 
The first star of the show was the milk bread. Oh my it was quite delicious with the butter slathered on it. It had a tad too much sea salt, which at times would over power the deliciousness of the bread. Unfortunately having a late reservation can come at a cost, they were out of a few dishes and desserts by the time we got there. So sad because I really wanted the hanger steak. It was hard to pair the other items on the menu together. The menu seemed to be a bit disjointed and not a variety of meat options. I settled for the duck fat potatoes and the fried soft shell crab because I could pair those together. The duck fat potatoes were delicious and I love the dill that was sprinkled on them. The crab had good flavor and seasoning but unfortunately my crab was not cooked all the way through. My friends ordered the scallops, squid ink pasta with shrimp and salad. They all said their dishes were good but not the best they've ever had. Overall it was a good dining  experience with great service and good atmosphere.

In fact, when I asked, I was told ""yeah, a lot of people ask us to, but we can't."" He said they get a request to turn it down just about every day. I asked if anyone had ever said they liked it loud or commented that they appreciated the music, and he said ""no."" 

There's no dance floor. It's not set up for people to rock out or whatever. It's just a sit-down restaurant inside the mall area of the hotel/casino. Pretty fucking stupid to play music that loud when no one likes it.

It's not like they are trying to entice people to come in either because the speakers all face inward. Once you step out into the walkway just outside the entrance, the music gets a lot quieter. It was just really absurd listening to ""back dat ass up"" while trying to enjoy a meal and a conversation with my girlfriend. It made it impossible. 

Noise aside, the food was pretty good. Some items were better than others. Burger was okay. Lobster Mac and Cheese was good. Cheesesteak rolls were okay. The milkshake was really good. I would give this place a 4 if it wasn't for the loudness inside. 

Another note is that the artwork on the walls was depressing. Sad cartoons that could have been drawn by peta in an attempt to turn people into vegetarians. Almost as bad a choice as the music. I liked the art, but it was pretty much a bummer. The decor was otherwise pretty good.

My favorite cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It is absolutely amazing!  

My favorite drinks are the Tropical Smoothie and the Frozen Iced Mango.

I really liked this show. It was amazing. We sat really close to the stage so everything looked extra special. The vertical stage was insane. I couldn't believe that all these actors were climbing this huge, rotating stage. 

The stage, costumes, and music were all beautiful. I was very riveted in my seat, and hoping that I wouldn't see a stunt gone wrong. 

I loved the show, but my only complaint was that there was not as many funny scenes as I would have liked. There was a lot of dancing, but I could only watch so much dancing. It would nice to have a little change of pace. There was no audience participation in this show like in other Cirque shows. That's probably why I like Zumanity a little bit more.",2012-05-06 04:21:43

First, the positives - our server was great (friendly, attentive, and helpful).  It was raining out and even though the patio was heated/covered, nobody was out there so we also opted to sit indoors.  LOVE the ambiance, decor and everything about the look of this place!!!  The fries were amazing. Loved how they were seasoned and I probably could just come here for fries and beer (which is probably what I'd recommend).  The dishes we ordered came out hot and fresh and were pretty tasty.
Now..the things I didn't love...the porkchop for two is cooked to medium (I think that's what the girl who dropped it off said)...I found this weird, as I always thought pork needed to be thoroughly cooked, no pink inside.  Maybe it was all in my head but I did not feel that great after eating this lol.  The brussel sprouts were drenched in butter. They tasted good at first, then it became too much.  The polenta was tasty - my first time having this but probably a good idea to share as it was also very buttery and rich so after a few bites I didn't want anymore.
Glad we were able to check this place out and I think we would return but more so for after work drinks and fries!",2013-11-20 20:50:38

Three Angry Wives offers not one, not two, but FIVE different versions of french toast! My fave is the Reeses French Toast which combines Peanut Butter Captain Crunch, peanut butter, and hot fudge. The toast is nice and thick and the portions are huge! Some other notable items are the Pretzel Bites with Cheese sauce .. so yummy! And the Cajun Chicken which has just the right amount of spice.

Took my friend for her 50th Birthday, so it was a special occasion. I mentioned that in the reservation, and they denoted that when seating us with a ""Happy Birthday!"" Very nice gesture.

Had to start with the Bang Bang Shrimp, which I call ""Shrimp Crack!"" This stuff IS addictive! Be forewarned....it's easy to eat the copious amounts they give you, and if you're not a big eater this dish alone can fill you up!

I also ordered the Corn Chowder with Lump Crab Meat. My GOD was this delicious! Best dish of the night for me. Very creamy, RICH and full of fresh crab and chunks of corn. Highly recommended!

We both got the ""Surf and Turn"" even though it is NOT explicitly on the menu. You have to order the steak of your choice (in our case Filet Mignon) and add a side of Surf (in our case Lobster tail). Not a hugh portion but still yummy for a giant sea cockroach! LOL....Steak was prepared the way I asked for it, and it was decent quality. Not the best Surf and Turf I've ever had but it was delicious nonetheless for a competitive price. Gotta love the butter dip they bring for the Lobster. I should have ordered 2 doses of Lipator with that!

They do have a nice wine list, and I ordered 2 glasses of Sparkling Wine to celebrate my friend's birthday.

The waitstaff is very nice, but our guy was a little inexperienced so I'll give him a ""mulligan"" for bringing our food to the next table, not bringing a cold bath for my wine, and being a little scatter brained. But he WAS very nice and tried hard. 

All in all a VERY good dinner and she loved and appreciated this experience.

It was surprising because first of all it was a weekday, it was pass dinner time, and it's a restaurant upstairs on second floor. I always stumble upon their posters on the escalator at Dundas station but never thought to try it out because I thought this is some health food place due to its name, so I was equally surprised to find out Salad King is actually a Thai food restaurant. Their menu only featured about 3 salad items lol. 

The environment:
The seating arrangement is quite ""sad"", like you sit in cafeteria style and there's no separation between you and the other people, so the noise level is on the higher end. I was able to get a seat when I was there, but the restaurant was still super packed. 
The bathroom was a little strange as well, my friend was uncomfortable to use the mixed gender bathroom. Basically everybody enters the same door to use the bathroom, but they do have individual stalls, so you actually only share the hand washing sinks. I was ok with the arrangement but it is something unconventional to see.

The food:
The menu was the sheet of paper that they put on top of the table to avoid getting the surface dirty. The prices were pretty cheap, most of the dishes were under $10. A lot of the options were spicy though, but as someone who don't normally eat spicy food, I think the one chili-level dishes were manageable. 
I ordered the Chicken Phud Tai with no spiciness and it was ok. The noodle was salty and sour and I liked the chewy texture of the rice noodle. The portioned seemed huge but it was mainly noodle, not a lot of chicken and veggies. I only managed to eat half of what was there and packed the rest home. The smell was pretty pungent so I don't suggest anyone to bring it to work and reheat it.  
I got a taste of my friend's Chicken Coconut Milk Soup (one chili-level) and Mango Coconut Milk Sticky Rice (non-spicy). The soup had an interesting taste, you don't taste the spiciness until the liquid gets to your throat, and eventually you would feel that the soup was indeed pretty spicy. I liked the coconut milk on the sticky rice, but I wish the coconut milk was scrambled with the rice for even flavour, instead of just poured on top of the rice. The mango was fresh but not ripe enough.

The service:
You get an assigned waiter for your table, which I feel is a bad arrangement, because they are always busy and don't have the time to check up on you. We didn't get any benefit from having an assigned waiter, when in fact we literally had to get another waiter to look for our waiter. I wish they could have just done it like Chinese restaurant style, where you can ask any waiter who just so happened to walk by for service. The food was slow too, I think we waited about 15-20mins to get served. 

Verdict:
I personally wouldn't come back here, despite some of my friends claimed to come here at least once each week. Food wasn't outstanding, and I just can't stand the noisy environment and the slow service.",2015-11-09 19:43:39

I got the Campfire S'more sundae with the Madagascar vanilla and chocolate scoops. I'll admit that I got it just to see the marshmellow on top get slightly toasted with the dessert torch. It felt and tasted like eating a creme brulee marshmellow on top of a giant ice cream s'more. 
My husband got the Peanut Butter Brittle sundae, which was also nothing less than perfect! It was hilarious because there were two visitors from Atlanta in front of us in line, who has just come straight from the airport to Sweet Republic because they had to try this ice cream!!

He found us a table outside with a bunch of little mini tables, pushed them all together for us, and remembered what kind of drink I casually mentioned. Great service!
Plus points for being in my neighborhood and locally-owned (I'm guessing).
The crepes were all good; caprese, ham & egg, pear & goat cheese were the ones I sampled. Only complaint: I wish there was more cheese in the caprese instead of so much pesto sauce.

Yes, GC is the devil, who puts little guys out of biz while bringing up the douche quality of musicians everywhere.  They have annoying sales people who are dangerously uninformed while being horribly brash.  They have plenty of crap product and they will sell it to you with glee.

There are a few saving graces.  1) I play acoustic guitars.  They have a nice selection at several price points which aren't all that horribly priced.  You can play the $3k Martins without being bugged and can stay for hours (sometimes a bad thing when old farts decide to play concerts loudly) 2) The sales people are dying to make a sale.  If you are going to spend money, they will bargain, just have to push.  3) If you buy used stuff from them from a brand they don't really carry, it may be priced to get out the door.  They are afraid they won't sell the stuff and it will just take up space.

Let's start this culmination of information out with a bit of advice - come early for your Dim Sum if it's CNY, for as you could imagine, the place gets jam packed!  I was fortunate (888! *the lucky numbers in Chinese) to be in a smaller group of just 3, but I can imagine for a larger group it'd be quite a wait.  We hit the spot right in time (around 10:20AM), and only waited about 5 or 10 minutes to be sat among some strangers, which was not at all an issue for us.  In fact, the little girl at our table was just killing me with her cuteness, so I suppose it was actually ideal!

Little plates and steamer baskets of tastiness are pushed around by several different servers and boy is there a variety!  Our leading lady led the way and suggested some popular dishes for our first time.  We had Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings) the shrimp was covered in a very unique textured dumpling, and I would not describe it as slimy or unpleasant... I actually rather enjoyed the exterior.  I, unfortunately, am not crazy for shrimp, so it was not among my favorite dish.  Let it be known that this is highly recommended though, and many others without a shrimp dislike, were beyond thrilled with it.  We also tried pork dumplings, which were coated in a tofu exterior.  I absolutely adored these!  The flavor, the texture, the slight crunch when you bit into them... I could have eaten an entire small plate to myself!  We then tried Siu Mai, which was a Shrimp and Pork dumpling which are wrapped in a fresh pasta skin that is left open, allowing the fillings to peek out.  A pleasant ginger rested atop.  Very jam packed with flavor and freshness!

We followed this with the side that surely put a spring in my step!  A light and crunchy and absolutely magnificent spring roll!  Man, this was by far the best spring roll I have ever had.  Light and crunchy, flaky, and fresh cabbage resting inside... it was delectable each and every bite.  Not to mention piping hot!  Oh my - it's got my mouth watering now!

Afterwards I noticed a very fresh and plump looking bun on a cart, which was Cha Siu Bao - otherwise known as a Chinese BBQ Pork Bun!  It grabbed my attention, so of course we ordered them.  Oh how savory this little bun was.  Perfect dough to sink your teeth into, surprising your buds with a hint of sweet and a mouthful of hearty meat.  It was FILLING, in more than one way  ;)

We then tried a Dan Ta, also known as an Egg Tart.  It was a mini little crust filled with egg custard and baked to a golden perfection.  Great texture on the exterior, but a softer squishier inside, as you would imagine.  It was lightly sweet and hit the spot as a nice end of the meal dessert.  You'd think, under rational mind, the meal would have ended there, right?  NO.  This girl (me) was craving some serious greens.  We ordered Chinese Broccoli which was essentially a combination of spinach and LONG broccoli.  Say bye-bye to Broccolini - there's a new boo in town, Chinese Broccoli!  ;)

All along throughout Dim Sum we sipped on some tasty Jasmine tea with floral accents.  We also were able to watch the very entertaining Lion be fed the little envelopes (Hong Paos) with money to bring good luck!  This was a thrill of a performance, and I was wildly impressed, especially considering the tight spaces this Lion found its way through.

All in all, this location wow-ed me to the max, and will certainly have my business for future Dim Sum-ing.

I started with a cider bomb of some sort (but drank it as a sipper rather than a shot). It was a good way to start off since the rest of the evening, I had much heavier chocolaty drinks. 

Between the 5 of us, we ordered berries and chocolate for dipping, cheese plate, and chocolate baguette. 
Berries with chocolate for dipping - pretty standard, but fun. 
Cheese plate - was 11.25 so I didn't expect any stupendous cheeses, they were pretty standard, but they weren't bad. Came with crackers, pecans, and apple slices. This was a nice way to break some of the sweet of the other things we ordered. 
Chocolate baguette - kind of strange -  basically a chocolate sandwich served with chips and chocolate dipping sauce. I probably wouldn't order that again. 

As far as the other drinks I tried - skip the cherries & chili's spiked hot chocolate - had a nice flavor but a strange gritty texture which is not what you expect from hot chocolate. The waiter did finally catch on to my hints that it was bad and asked if I wanted another drink. Ended up with blood orange champagne - very nice and refreshing after all that chocolate!

Took home a piece of chocolate mousse cake for my husband - that was good.

We were slightly confused but our server later confirmed this place Shady Park is really three places in one...two restaurants and one bar/lounge.  Interesting...hope it works out for them!

We were here for the noodles (as were most of the patrons, it seemed).  It'd been a while since we had Asian food (like two WHOLE days) so we were excited.  However, given where we were, we went in cautiously...

Ultimately, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of both Damato's and Umami's offerings with the exception of a couple things.  In the lineup:

Vegan Chop Salad:  REALLY good.  Can't even notice the ""veganess"" of it. The breaded vegan chicken was delightfully meaty and moist.

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was good.  However, the fried chicken topping hubby got was THE WORST.  It was stale and dry and hubby ended up picking it all out of his bowl to not eat. They're better off using the vegan chicken.

Spicy Tan Tan: This was my choice.  I got it with the pork belly which they confidently nicknamed ""crack"" as well as the soft boiled egg.  I also paid for the spicy garlic paste.  This dish was probably the best out of all we ordered.  The soft boiled egg was done well and the spicy garlic paste even had a little kick to it.  The pork belly was pretty good, too. (Not ""crack-like"" addictive, though.)

Squid Salad: Not sure if this is house-made; it generally isn't at most places so I don't hold it against them.  However, it seemed to be fishier than usual.  Wonder if it was old??

Our server was super nice and friendly, cute to boot. She checked in on us regularly and got us everything we wanted.

Bonus points for having an Addams Family pinball machine...50 cents per play ended up being actually 5 full games.

Only complaint:  It was warm.  It was a warm day and it wasn't super pleasant eating ramen in such a warm room.  We weren't sweating through our clothes but they need to have more air in there.

To start we tried their tuna tartare. It was presented in a glass bowl mixed with watermelon and soba noodles. Love all the ingredients in this dish but perhaps it was sitting in the kitchen too long...it was a bit of a soggy appetizer. The soba noodles were refreshing and flavorful but the rest of the dish was otherwise bland. 

For the entree I went with their Charcoal Grilled Flat Iron Steak. I loved the sweet corn succotash that came with this dish! Unfortunately, the meat was under-cooked. I asked the waiter for it to be cooked medium rare but it definitely came out as rare. Not a big deal but surprising for such a fancy establishment.The chimichurri gave it a bit of spice and although you aren't given a ton of meat, I was full afterwards.

I was over the moon excited, but the service was such a let down, I don't think I would ever give it a second chance.

I am not trying to be Ms. Whinypants here. I understand the whole sitting with others at the table concept.  When my two friends and I showed up for my friend's birthday party, we were greeted right away.  We said that we had a party of 6 and they will be there in less than 5 minutes.  The hostess explained that we could sit at the bar and wait, but she couldn't seat us until our whole party arrived.  She did point out that there was seating for 6 people and she was going to reserve it for us, but she couldn't hold it until the whole party arrived.

Well, while we were waiting, a couple walked in and asked to be seated.  There were other places for them to be seated....but she chose to seat them at our ""reserved"" spot.  After that, while we were still standing there, she ignored us.  Didn't explain to us that she had to seat them there or anything.  We were just completely ignored.  Even when she noticed that another person in our party arrived. An explanation would have been nice. 


We thought it was unprofessional and lost the customer service appeal altogher.  We felt like she chose 2 people or 6.

They were hesitant 'cause they hadn't been here before and were expecting to to one of our usual brunch places, but they ended up being extremely happy with the experience.
Customer service was awesome. After greeting us, the cashier noticed that we were probably new to the place, so he told us a little about the ordering process and menu (regular items, faves, and seasonal specials). Pretty chill and nice guy. 
The sister ordered the Halloween-themed menu for a waffle and a cold latte. Mom ordered a Halloween-themed hot latte with a West Coast Wafflewich. I ordered a cold Chocolate Coconut with a West Coast Wafflewich. Hahaha... The sister liked her waffle and her drink, but she wished she had ordered the same wafflewich as us. It had a pretty amazing sauce, and the ingredients tasted as fresh as can be. I will admit that I wish I had their latte though. Don't get me wrong 'cause I liked my drink, but I tasted more chocolate than coconut, and I'm looking for a balance. 
The cashier also kept making sure we were okay as I got the food whenever it was ready to be picked up from the counter.

I came in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The restaurant was empty at the time. At first glance, the restaurant is small, but the design was very elegant. There was interior and exterior seating and a bar area. We were greeted by Leyla who had a big smile on her face and was very welcoming and helpful.

I had viewed the Pars menu the previous weekend, but needed to look through it again to remind myself what it was that caught my eye before. It didn't take me long to realize I was there for the shish kebab and selected the lamb shish kebab. I typically don't select an appetizer or side dish, but this was my first time at Pars so I wanted to go a little all out. Leyla knew my companion and I were new to Pars so she provided some really good recommendations. We had the Maust' Mooster, which was plain yogurt with shallots to go with pita bread, which was warm, but not toasted. Unexpectedly, it turned out great. I loved how the pita bread was warm, but not toasted because I typically have it toasted. The yogurt had a little bit of a salty flavor to it, which was unexpected as well, but appreciated. 

The lamb shish kebabs came out aromatic. The rice was white with saffron on it. I loved how the rice was so fluffy. I can't remember the last time I had rice that fluffy. I have to figure out how to get my rice that fluffy. The shish kebab wasn't skewered, which was fine. The lamb was tender and could easily sliced using spoon and fork. I loved the texture of the tomatoes and the onions were a great complement with the lamb and rice. 

I didn't intend on getting dessert as I was very satisfied with what I had, but my companion ordered the Persian ice cream, which comprised of pistachios and honey. I think Leyla mentioned that it also had cashews. The ice cream was made at the restaurant. It was thick and creamy. It was delicious, but not too sweet.

My favorite out of the 3 flavors was passion fruit. The ice was nice and fluffy and not overly crunchy or rough like other sno cones I've had in the past.

Size portions are pretty large and the regular size was too big for me to even finish...major brain freeze! Next time I'll probably opt for a smaller size. The spoons also change colors when cold, which kept us entertained for a while.

Even after seeing the below average reviews including the negative opinion from a good friend of mine, we still opted to try.

We shared:

Garbage salad( added gorgonzola $15 ) - very average salad - small, not much in the way of meat and cheese

Chicken meatballs w/ pesto sauce ($9) - tender meatballs, flavorful sauce. we all liked it.

Classic Meatballs w/ spicy meat sauce ( added cheese - total $12) - the winner of the group.  Great flavors and the meatballs were very tender.

Beef meatballs w/ parmesan sauce ( $10) - meatballs were tender, average flavor but the parmesan sauce was very flavorful ( kinda like alfredo sauce )

service was good - drinks were properly refilled.

Overall we liked the food.  Prices waaay to high for what you get and the salad was sub-par but i'll probably return ( especially when I can give the desserts a try )

They all gave me an attitude along with a really rude answer ""umm you can go find it yourself"". Nice job management for hiring kids that'll drive customers away. Also at check out I simply asked if they offer military discounts because the one at galleria does. I've never had someone roll their eyes at me, the look on her face as if she was disgusted by me! So by the time she gave me a total and was bagging my items, i just walked away. I didn't buy the items i wanted too because I am not going to support a store who shows only disrespect towards their customers.
I now only shop at the Galleria mall (even though its a lot smaller) or online to NOT deal with such terrible people.",2016-03-11 16:22:40

The first time we went here, even my teenagers were in awe and played like they were kids again.  If you have a Discovery place family membership you can add this place to it for a mere $30 and as a family of 6, it totally made sense.  Price is 10 bucks per person, so pay and be on your way.  Inside this gem of a place they have a plethora of mini places for the kids to use their imagination.  What's a mini place?  Well, you have your vet's office, a fire truck with gear, a mini farm, a toddler's area, a bank with a drive thru, a tumble, rock climbing area, a diner, a Dr's office, a stage with hourly performances and then costumes the kids can dress up in back stage and then perform, an attic with games and books, an under the sea room experience, an arts and crafts room, a room with building blocks, a car mechanic experience, a race car, an airport upstairs and more.  I'm sure I'm missing something else.  My favorite spot is the fake diner with it booths and fake food, a salad bar, an oven, bakery case and cash register, you could really let your imagination run wild.  It also cuts down on the bored parent trying to keep the kid entertained factor.  You really kind of get caught up in it too.

The second time I went it was a bit ""full"" but it was also summer break so, duh!  There's not much in the area so if you get hungry you should pack a lunch to eat outside or in a small area with tables just past the entry point.  The lady at the front desk told me there was no wifi but when I searched, I got 2 hours free by submitting my email address. I'm not sure if that means next time I go, I have to pay.  On the other hand, maybe not having wifi is intentional so they can make sure we keep track of our ""snotty nosed kids"" and don't have our faces glued to our phone screens. LOL!

So I highly recommend this place and if your kids don't have fun then I just don't know what would be fun for them.  Maybe Disney?

Their wine list has always been, current, going with the latest trends in grapes ... from Cabs in the early 00s, to Pinots in 03-04, and now featuring Malbec and Tempranillos.  

While this is slightly frustrating as a wine (whine?) snob, i have to give it up to Postino for making available the varietals that people like me want to drink when they're spending $11 a glass at a wine bar.

The casino decor is definitely a nice European facade but I think the best feature are its many restaurants!

So many varieties, Chinese, American, French, Italian, and more, I was in foodie heaven!

Places I ate at: Gordon Ramsay's Steak, Mon Ami Gabi, Yong Kang Street, & Hexx! I would go back and eat at these places again.

I also went to the top of the Eiffel Tower to get a nice 360 degree view of Las Vegas. 

(Hey locals: you get a discounted price & kids under 6 is free!) if you're squeamish about heights, don't go...

Gaming - 2 stars
For a casino of this caliber, they have a dearth of fun machine to play slots on.  The floor has very few cocktail waitresses making rounds, although the areas are kept pretty clean.  The number of gaming tables is a lot less than you would imagine.  Returns on gaming are pretty bad.  I don't think that I have really come up here, and the lack of people makes for a spooky vibe.  There were no hand dealt tables for BJ, all shoes.

Hotel - 4 stars
Great restaurants always make for a pleasurable stay at a hotel.  Aria is no exception.  One of the biggest perks is that center stage of the casino is John Phillipe Patisserie.  What a great place to get dessert or a bite to eat in the morning.  The rooms are nicely appointed, although a bit small.  I strongly suggest that you do not opt for the smoking room, as the ventilation systems here are pretty weak.  We got stuck with one and the room smelled like an ashtray.  The smell of stale cig smoke was in all of our clothes, luggage, etc.  This was less than a year after they opened, so it must be far worse by now.

This took the place of Inyo and most of the sign is actually in Korean and the words ""TangTangTang"" is tucked to the side and it's hard to read unless you are looking hard.  

I came with friends who frequented TTT and we got the bossam, the spicy pork ribs and the pork shoulder soup for the four of us.  It was more than enough and we had leftovers of the bossam.  The pork shoulder soup was very flavorful - filled with that Korean leafy greens and pork shoulder.  Spicy pork rib was quite spicy but also very delicious.  My favorite is the bossam.  The pork belly platter was surprisingly not greasy at all.  You wrap it with the young napa cabbage and that red sauce complemented the cabbage and the meat.  It's also a cold dish, so it's perfect for Vegas' summers.

There aren't nearly as many vendors or food booths but I did enjoy walking around and looking at everything.  I went with my daughter and her friend and I watched the baby while they went to a concert in the evening.  The admission price is much more reasonable at this fair than the the one in San Diego and the senior price is even better.

 The next time I went was last year. My granddaughter was a baby in a stroller and the grandson was two.  I went with my two youngest daughters on the weekend when the price was only $2 if you got there before 2 o'clock . Because we had the kids I decided to go ahead and pay the $10 to park in the inside lot near to the entrance and I was glad we did. We didn't spend too much on food because we did a lot of splitting and we did stay until the concert started and I got to see the band Weezer. It was very loud so I held my hands over the baby's ears the whole time but I have to admit I did enjoy the music . I'm embarrassed to say that that was probably my first rock concert, so the baby,  the toddler and I all went to our first rock concert together.   

Last year we kind of discovered by accident a toddler and child play area that my grandson just loved and we let him work out some of his energy on all the baby safe equipment that they had there since he'd spent a long time just sitting in the stroller as we walked around. I had taken the baby sling that I used for my now 23 year old and loved so much I never did get rid of it, and carried the baby around in that most of the day, very comfortably I might add. There was a vendor there selling an item that look like an oversized backpack on wheels called the Shopping Jeep that I bought for $20 and I have used the heck out of that thing ever since I bought it. It's not the highest quality item I ever bought and I've had to mend it where a seam ripped but I still got a lot of good use out of it.  

This year we didn't go to any concerts.  The kids were 1 and 3 and my daughter is expecting again so we didn't want to overdo, but somehow we ended up being there from 1:30 pm to 10 p.m. I don't know how we spent that much time there but we were busy the whole time. My daughter thinks we spent over an hour just in the play area which is possible because both of the kids were enjoying it so much . Again we got there before 2 on a Sunday so we only had to pay $2 each for the grown ups and the kids were free so we splurged and paid the $10 to park inside. To my surprise there was a lot on the outside charging $20 for parking! That didn't make any sense at all to me. My daughter was bemoaning the fact that she couldn't go bungee jumping but I told her she shouldn't be doing that anyway now that she's a mother. All in all we had a fun day but came home very tired.

Like all fairs the food and rides are expensive but we split food and don't go on rides.  A turkey leg with no sides was $11.25 but it had enough meat for both of us and bites for the kids.  We got a small funnel cake for $4.50 and shared it.  She brought snacks and drinks for the kids and they ate them all.  

The kids really enjoyed the animals but the only petting area we saw charged to get in so we were content to look through the pens.  I always enjoy watching the vendors do their demos and we stopped to listen to a singer for a few minutes.  We spent quite awhile walking through the Ice Age display with moving animals.  Last year it was an insect display.  

Bathrooms were plentiful and adequately kept up.

Would I recommend the fair to others? Yes! It is a great family activity.",2013-10-29 05:40:51

Just a few steps from the Lansdowne TTC station, Chito's is a great place to pop in and grab a quick bite to eat. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here for sit down, because (1) there's not much seating to begin with - only stools that face the back/side wall, and (2) you probably want to get in and out as fast as possible to avoid absorbing too many calories from the airborne grease.  Although they're known for their pizza, I only ever tried the chicken wraps.  For $4 (no tax), you get a decent sized chicken wrap with meat straight off the spit.  

The best part, they have LOTS of toppings (more than 10 if I recall correctly) plus the delicious garlic and hot sauce.  Don't forget to get extra napkins because these things are a challenge to eat, especially if ordered fully loaded.",2011-12-12 19:03:23

She let us take our time figuring out what we wanted and answered any questions we had. They have burgers, fries, shakes and some other options. 

I went with one of their special burgers, The Dad Burger, instead of playing it safe. The Dad came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, sriracha honey peanut butter, apricot preserves, and arugula. I wasn't quite sure how I was going to like the flavor... but it was amazing! I was so glad I ordered it. A little sweet, a little spicy, it was honestly the perfect mix. Hopefully I'll be able to grab this again before it's off the menu. 

I also ordered the sweet potato fries with a side of garlic aioli. They were pretty dang good!

My girlfriend got a plain cheeseburger and regular fries. She thought it was pretty solid. We also got the Cookie Monster Shake. It was tasty but we couldn't finish it. We were stuffed by the end of the meal. If you factor in a burger, fries and a drink you're looking at around $15 or so per person depending on what you order, but I think it's worth it!

""WOOD STONE"" EATERY. wow. my aesthetic meter was tingling. The plates were metal which kind of reminded us of a jail, but they were pretty cute lmfao. 

Menu was interesting.... it only consisted of 4 pages really. Appetizers, drinks, noodles and rices/pastas. The only ""viable"" page in my opinion was the rices/pastas page. I opted for the spaghetti with chicken in it which was $11.99. I think it was definitely pricey for what was given. If this was 9.99 then I'd be less mad. The ""regular"" spaghetti did not have meat in it and I think it should just come with it as it feels incomplete. It tasted good, but was it mind blowing? No. 

Our server was not good at all lol. Dude's personality was not fit for this kind of job. We had a different good server before but he disappeared and never came back, leaving us with this guy.

We asked if there was another bar on the upper level and she said yes, then looked up at the telvision above her head with camera views of the different areas of the restuarant/bar and said ""It's very crowded up there.""  Well, it's Saturday night and we want to be apart of the crowd!  Strange that they have the camera views visible.

I sat at the bar, and waited for 15 minutes for the bartender to come over to offer me a drink, and the place was empty.

The place is very clean, quiet, dark and has awesome relaxing music with ocean sounds. I am even heard someone snoring in there! The massage was a really great. I was asked if I wanted deep tissue and I said no. My massage was definitely deep tissue! So if you are someone who does not like hard massage then you need to be sure to voice that. For me it actually worked really well. I was suffering from a debilitating migraine and back pain and an hour after my migraine was gone and I felt so much better. That night I actually slept through the night for the first time in a very very long time. The next day I was not near as bruised feeling as I thought I might be and usually am after a normal massage. I got the basic $20 service and tipped $20. The best $40 I've spent in a really long time!
The only reason I gave it four stars is because there is a language barrier and I did not ask for deep tissue.

This restaurant doesn't really specialize in korean bbq, but they certainly did have a couple options on the menu for it.  We ordered #1,2,3 off of the Korean bbq menus, and 1 of us ordered a chicken cutlet dish. The amount of meat given wasn't worth the money, IMO. Each kbbq menu item was suited for 2 people, but the amount of meat given was probably only good enough for 1 hungry person and 1 not so hungry person. Came with a soup (I believe it was kimchi jigae).

Anyways, like others have said, they provide a huge variety of side dishes, and also provide a small onion pancake dish for every 2-3 people. Their kimchi is awesome quality, they provide 2 types of potatoes, seaweed, bean sprouts, and more. They also provide lettuce for making lettuce wraps. The waitress demonstrated how to make the lettuce wraps (multiple times, to note). As others have said, the waitresses don't have the greatest English skills, but surprisingly, one of the waitresses speaks decent Mandarin. Oh, and apparently there's a Chinese menu but we weren't notified about it. 

The Korean BBQs - they waitresses come by to stir and put the meat on for you, so it's not really self serve (in terms of the cooking), as done at many Korean BBQ places. The meat quality is pretty good, and they allow multiple refills on the side dishes. The strange thing is that they serve brown rice as default (I don't even think they have white rice). 

There is even a button on each table to ring in the waitresses, which I thought was pretty cute and convenient.

My husband and I had been wanting to try Moroccan Paradise as we had seen it while dining at other restaurants in the area. His parents were wanting to try something different so we went on Friday night for dinner. The restaurant wasn't too busy but after talking to our server, he said business was slower so he was actually the only one taking care of all the tables. The service wasn't too prompt but it wasn't an issue.

We started off with a couple of the smoothie drinks, I was not impressed with my choice. I can't remember what it was called but it had avocado, mango, and a third flavor. My dinner was just okay also. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma which came with rice, potato wedges, and a side salad. I thought the seasonings on the chicken were a little bit weird, not like typical Chicken Shawarma. This restaurant had a different version which I can appreciate but it was a bit bland. My husband ordered the Vegetarian Platter, my mother-in-law got the Beef w/Prunes Tajine, and my father-in-law got the Lamb Couscous.

The Beef w/Prunes Tajine was unique with a sweeter flavor, I tried a bite and thought it was pretty tasty. This dish seemed to be their signature item and was probably the best one out of all of the dishes we had at the table. My father-in-law liked the Lamb Couscous and my husband enjoyed his Vegetarian Platter as well. I tasted all the items from the platter and liked the eggplant the best due to the flavor, all others were mediocre, lacked flavor.

All-in-all, as previously mentioned, our experience was just okay. The prices were a bit high for the quality of the food. The flavors of some of the items were better than others, so I'm still undecided if I will return or not.",2017-12-20 03:10:27

We sat at a high top table close to the bar. Good set up and the decor is very polished and clean. Server was friendly and joked around with the table, gave suggestions for the food and drinks. 

Two of my colleagues ordered the beef Mac and cheese, another the prosciutto flat bread, and I got the beef burger. Sides of fries were ordered too, mine came with. The burger was interesting, but after deliberation, not great. Our server asked how things were and I answered good which was a knee jerk response and not disingenuous but like I said, after thinking it over I wouldn't order it again. It wasn't really bad...it just didn't taste like a burger to me. The patty had almost a pur√©e like texture to it, and I felt the bbq sauce on it didn't match with the other flavors. The presentation was good, serving time was good, it was cleanly put together and cooked how it was supposed to be. It had some spices and herbs that looked like chilli's. Maybe it's just not my type of burger. 

The fries were good. I like shoestring fries, which these were, double fried and served with dried mint leaves. They were tasty. The mayo side was infused with other favoring and was good.

The flatbread was done well but the table felt rather uninspiring. Flavor was just okay and it was kind of dry. Apparently they used to have a sausage flatbread which was better.

I didn't have the Mac and cheese, but the reviews from my colleagues were good and it's $7! That's pretty good considering the location and the popularity of Mac and cheese these days. And it's an award winner! Thumbs up.

We liked it enough that we went two nights in a row for dinner!  The first night we went with the namesake, their beef shawarma.  The combo with seasoned fries, pickled turnips & a can of soda is $7.99.  The beef or chicken shawarma by itself is $5.99.  Not a bad deal for a meal, pricing about the same for other Mediterranean joints in town.

Didn't take long for things to come out.  Upon first inspection their shawarma could use a bit more of a serving of meat in the pita.  It was on the sparse side, but thankfully the shawarma meat that was there was pretty flavorful and tender.  Spiced right, and with the included garlic sauce they make, the shawarma was most tasty.  Like their fries too with the seasonings used, I think it's probably the same stuff they use for their shawarma meat.  Picked turnips were nice & purple, but didn't do much for me since they lacked any sort of flavor or pickling.

The second night we opted for 2 of their whole rotisserie chicken meals for $8.49 each.  Good value, the rotisserie chicken meal comes with a fresh made chicken, rice, pitas, hummus, garlic sauce, and pickled turnips.  Granted the chickens are on the small side (meaning not Costco humongous chicken) but they were moist and very flavorful with their Mediterranean dry rub.  This chicken stuffed in a pita and topped with some garlic sauce made for some good eating!

Rotisserie chicken was good enough for us to order a few more for lunch at our house on Thanksgiving!  Yep, chicken before the big turkey night event!  And our family really liked their chicken a lot.  They all agreed that garlic sauce adds a big flavor boost.  Could slather the stuff on a boot!

The interior is pretty nice with windows looking out over market square (well, not such a nice view until the city finishes construction). The roof is essentially one giant skylight, but they keep it covered during the day.

The food is a few different things. Meatballs, pizza, salads, sandwiches and some sides. I also got a birthday shake once. The food is good, but the slow service and not very friendly servers are losing it points. 

First impressions walking in are wow if I look long enough I will see up the hostesses dresses. I realize we are in Vegas but come on. I sat outside once and inside twice. The music outside makes it difficult to have a conversation it is loud. The seats throughout the place are uncomfortable. I guess they don't want you staying long. 

We received displeased looks from servers and people working there the two times we brought out child. It is kid friendly, but not super kid friendly. When asked for a child's menu the hostess told me everything on the menu is kid friendly and they don't get a specific menu. 

Meatballs are good. Pick your meat. Pick your sauce. You get three good sizes balls and sauce with garlic bread. Salads are good. I found mine to be delicious. Pizza is way too big. The large slice is more then enough. They have a half pan size which is the size of an entire cookie sheet. I'm not sure how big the full size is. The problem with pizza is the lack of toppings.

We got the onion rings as an appetizer and they were huge! The batter tasted a lot like a funnel cake which was also an unexpected flavor, but it worked. The rings also had a drizzle of what I think was a balsamic glaze.

The staff members have always been friendly and courteous to me no matter if I was here for a musical or a more comic solo act (yeah, I mean Alton Brown.  That was awesome. #humblebrag.)  I have had some difficult conversations with staff members in the ticketing office, though, who seemed less than thrilled to have to speak with me.  A case of ""We have a website, can't you just go online and do this!""",2014-03-02 02:58:08

My mom ordered a pasta dish, but couldn't get further than a few bites because she wasn't feeling the great. The server was so sweet and was trying to help my mom.

They were attentive and friendly.  Aside from the always friendly bartenders, whether veterans or rookies at Sin City, the beeer is also a good reason to come in.

Although I have been to Korea many times, and I have tried many Korean Restaurants in the States, my exposure to Korean food is limited to the famous Korean restaurants in Los Angeles and in Vegas. 

This restaurant is located in a strip mall. The interior decoration is relatively bare but enough for a local Korean family restaurant. Servers are friendly and attentive. However, the food may be a bit too Korean and not terribly suitable for non-Koreans.

My family came for lunch and had the following items:

Japche -- portion is small for an  $11 price. Vegetable variations are minimal in the dish.  As 
                advertised in the menu, there is no meat protein in this dish.  I like my Japche 
                warm, but this dish was served slightly colder than what I would prefer. The 
                taste is good though.  Grade B-.

Grilled Pork Bulgogi - portion is large. Spicy. Taste is good. What is not good is that they 
               use Pork Belly for this dish. This makes this dish very greasy in a way that I rejected  
               it after one bite - may be that is OK for a real Korean type dish but unfortunately, not 
               for me.  Grade D-. 

Galbitang -- Short rib soup. There is an ample amount of meat on the short ribs. The soup is 
                    quite tasty. This is not a heavy soup. However, the amount of vegetables and 
                    noodle in this dish is minimal making this dish a bit monotonous.  Grade B.

Sides dishes - Kimichi, Radish and marinated onion and pepper. Kimchi is good. Radish and 
                   onion are OK. Since they offer us only three spicy side dishes, it is a bit difficult for 
                   non Korean. I prefer some other Korean side dishes that are not as spicy, e.g. 
                   bean sprouts, spinach, potato salad, etc. Grade C-. 

For a non Korean, this restaurant is at best an OK place to eat. I do understand that Korean folks may feel differently though. Henceforth, a three star rating.",2017-06-12 00:54:42

XvoSS1x7bowQziq_nCjujQ,rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,1,2,0,1,"Came in around 3pm for lunch Yesterday after debating between Julian Serrano or Herringbone. My girlfriend and I had planned to go here for our anniversary dinner a week ago but was told the patio was closed due to an event so we ended up doing lunch at Milos that day. Still wanting to give this place a try we walked up to the host stand to get seated and was told they only have their small bites menu. Which seemed weird for a restaurant to only offer that menu at that time when they have their only lunch menu and dinner menu but I guess the kitchen might have been transitioning to dinner or something. We were hungry and in a rush so we were seated outside at the patio which was nice. What wasn't great was being put in the middle of the Vegas sun as it's hitting the 90s now with barely any shade while everyone around us seemed to be covered especially as we were in jeans and my girlfriend had on a sweater. Also it was strange how a group of ladies were able to order full sized menu items while we weren't allowed to partake with no explanation.

Service: I know it's more of a casual restaurant but you're still working on the strip in a high end casino. Server did his spiel and gave quick unhelpful answers when I asked about the menu which consisted of like 6 things. Like thanks for reading it for me that totally helps in my decision. Kept pushing drinks, when they couldn't even have the decency to give out cold iced water to guests sitting out in the patio. I know it was our choice to sit there but you'd think one would be aware enough to realize maybe the majority of guests outside would enjoy iced water instead of warm water in the sun. I know they make their money from drinks but you don't have to keep pushing after we said we're good the first few times. When we were eating my girlfriend asked for hot sauce and the server responded with ""You mean Tabasco?"" In a condescending tone and proceeded to tell his busser who yelled about it as they both dicked around for a bit before finally taking it out, all while we were still two feet away. The runner did a good job bringing the food out and breaking down the dishes so at least one part was good. 

Food: We ordered 4 fish tacos with one being beer battered, Kobe Burgers w/ Fries, and the ""famous"" Buffalo Octopus. The first fish taco was decent that was beer battered while the grilled one was flat, plain, and riddled with bones. Everything was literally soggy and I couldn't tell if I was eating tortilla or fish. Do you know that feeling you have as a kid when your parents make you eat something even though you didn't want to and you're crying as you chew it with tears streaming down your face? That's how I felt with the tacos. The Kobe sliders. I've had angus beef that was better than what was served. For Herringbone to even sell this as ""Kobe"" is a crime. Barely tasted the meat as it was mostly the thick bun which they couldn't decide if they wanted it soft or toasted and at what parts. The Buffalo Octopus was decent with the first bite but afterwards I couldn't tell if I was eating Chicken or Octopus as it was fried so tough that I felt like I was eating a buffalo wing at Bdubs. Honestly the best part of my meal was probably the french fries. Which isn't saying much as it's the same thing you can get at any burger joint.  

Thoughts: Herringbone is a chain restaurant spawning from California and I get that. I understand it's more casual. But this is not a high end chain restaurant even though they market and price it as such. You could honestly get better food at Applebees or Chilis. These servers and bussers act entitled for no reason at all. I'm not even sure if what we ate was made by a chef of herringbone or just thrown out to us by the Aria Pool Kitchen. Which I wouldn't be surprised as they are connected. I ended up paying about $80 after tip and I wish I went to Julian Serrano. You go into certain places with a set of expectations with the price point you pay and this place shattered all expectations and runs away with your money all while leaving you feeling sick from questionable fish tacos.",2017-05-03 12:02:25

The service was attentive in certain aspects, but the pace was truly horrific. 30 minutes before we received our first cocktails. 45 minutes before our food was able to be ordered. With our three course meal, the experience took three and a half hours. Good thing we were not on a time restraint. Normally, I wholeheartedly support the slow food culture, but I need an appetizer to come out in a timely manner to help quell the hunger. By the time the food started to roll out, we were enjoying the cocktails and each others company. 

Cocktails:

Mos-quito- A mojito made with ginger beer. It had a bite and the right amount of herbal notes to make it a refreshing drink.

Queen Bee- Sweet as honey and goes down like candy.

I forget the name, but it is made with jalapeno vodka, St. Germain, and cucumber soda. Hands down, the best. 

Bottles of wine are also very affordable. Going to Lee's to get a bottle of Nickel and Nickel ran about the same as us ordering it at the restaurant. 

Appetizers:

Steak Tartare- Group favorite. Even the anti-raw food committee enjoyed it. The best of all the first course dishes. With the bread, it helped to fill empty stomachs. On it's own, it is a parade for the taste buds.

Yellowtail Sashimi- I am not a big fan of this fish and still found the dish palatable. The slight spice of the radish and crispy of the jicama gave new sensations to a normally disagreeable taste.

HS Shrimp Cocktail- Once you have one, you have had them all. Nothing wow worthy.

Paleta Iberico Ham- All the components were there. They were all pleasant, but the minus eight vinegar was not as prevalent as we were expecting. 

Buratta Salad- I adore buratta. Mozzarella stretched, filled with cream and more soft cheese which oozes once cut. Delicious.

Margharita Pizza- Simple, classic, and not bad.


Entrees:

Caramelized Sea Scallops- Scallops are best when not cooked all the way through. Ours came out to the table at an odd temperature. The flavors were good, but the whole dish was cool. Do they cut their scallops in half? because the pieces looked small.

Scottish Salmon- Forgettable. The pitch is more impressive than the follow through.

Turkey Bolognese- Farro pasta cooked well and the blend of ingredients complemented each other well.

Free Range Brick Oven Chicken- It is hard to impress with chicken, but the skin on the bird was phenomenal. It was crisp and had a crunch that would rival a kettle chip. The mac and cheese needed a kick. When paired with the sweet pepper side, it was amazing.

12oz. NY Strip- By far, the best deal on the whole menu. It was tender, juicy, cooked to perfection, and cannot be beat at $28. 


Sides:

All of them, yet the sweet peppers were the only ones that stood out on its own or when combined with something else.


Desserts:

Tried them all, there was nothing super impressive. The bread pudding was the strongest offering. The bourbon toffee sauce was an essential factor.  I would have been happier with just sipping on the nutcello.",2012-11-12 05:40:52

We arrived in time for Happy Hour and ordered a number of items from the discounted HH menu -- gyoza, sliders, shrimp tempura, fire dragon rolls and calamari. They brought everything at once -- it hardly fit on the table. Since everything was cooked, by the time we got around to eating it, after trying to organize the platters and dishes on the table, everything was cold. Most of the dishes were tasty, but the soggy calamari with asian pesto dipping sauce was abominable! We also had the sashimi platter and tuna tataki. As always, the fish was fresh and melt in your mouth.

I have always been a huge fan of Pure Sushi . . . but the service we received on an early Tuesday evening was mediocre at best. At three minutes after 6 pm (the end of HH), our server asked if we wanted another drink. Three minutes after 6!!!  A conscientious server would have come by three minutes to 6 and said, HH is over in a few minutes, would you like to order another drink, or last call for HH . . . and then, as I wrote above, all the items coming out at one time . . . should never have happened that way.

I made my reservation for 5:30 for 4 people. We sat down with 3 people waiting on the 4th. The waitress took about 10 minutes to reach our table. We told her to brig the Sangria ( which tasted like pure sugar water this time) and a calamari for and app. She brought the items and we told her we would be ordering the Paella because it takes 40 minutes to cook. She said fine and walked away. 

After about 25 minutes I called her over and asked if we could order. I also just wanted to double check with her that she put the paella in for 4 people . She looked at me like I was crazy. She said no, she put it in for 2 people. WHAT??? We have a table of 4. She said we should just order an extra item off of the menu if we were still hungry. I asked for the manager right away.

The manager came over and I explained the situation. He said he would try and get a 4 person paella expedited for us. He came out 5 minutes later and said we were so lucky because someone else had ordered a 4 person and he would just give us theirs. After we had all of our small plates, which were good they brought out the paella. OMG was this a joke? You could see right away that the rice was not cooked. We asked them to serve it up and they just glared at us and left a spoon. We tried eating it and the rice was so raw it was literally sticking to our teeth. We were picking it out. I called the manager back over. We asked him to taste it, he did and said that is how they serve it. What a liar. I have had the paella here so many times and never tasted this kind of crap. 

He took it away and we just ordered the donuts for dessert. We ordered 2 orders so we could all have some. They brought out 3 and also a flan that tasted horrible and no one ate. The manager came back over and said he had removed several things off of our check. When we got the check, they charged us for half of a paella and 3 orders of donuts. WHAT??? GET THE MANAGER!! He came over again about 10 minutes later with a new check and said ""oh here is your real check"". Are you serious Mr. Manager? Nice try ripping me off. 

This was a disaster and I will never return to this restaurant. What a joke! This place is not cheap and they should have it together by now. That waitress and manager should be fired for playing silly little games. Oh and by the way even after the removal of the paella we still spent roughly $300- So we were really not looking for a free meal, just good food and service.",2013-06-04 17:16:05

I was intrigued when I first peeped the new signage while under construction from the open area of the Gold Spike.  I love how downtown LV is transforming right before my eyes.

Anyhow, a co worker of mine told me about a place called Stewart and Ogden, named after the other two roads running parallel from Fremont.  The menu provides some fun facts about Mr. Stewart and Mr. Ogden as well, referencing their polar opposite attitudes and peculiar relationship.  It was Xmas eve and the first time we didn't head back home for the holidays.  Almost all the good spots were closed.  We initially tried to hit up Container Park until we learned that they closed early for the holidays.
 
It was real quiet and wasn't quite what I expected, especially since my co worker is a foodie extraordinaire, which boggles me why she is not on Yelp.  I was expecting something more intimate and not just another casino diner.

Well beggars can't be choosers.  I ordered the pub cheese, but got served the...calamari instead?!?  I never order calamari, been over it since, the 90's???  The wifey ordered the tomato bisque, which was ok but not impressive and tasted like a stick of butter was dropped in it.  When asked what we want to drink, I am pretty particular, so asked what's on the drink menu.  The answer was...""there is none.""  Okay fine, so I asked what whiskey, bourbon or scotch was available.  Unfortunately, the waiter was probably new and unfamiliar with the offerings.  Eventually, the most exotic thing closest to what I was looking for was a McCallan 12, doable I suppose.  

The decor weird was wierd, kinda like and old time, early 1900's feel, only open in a casino.  I never quite enjoyed eating in a cage where everyone can watch you and blow some second hand smoke flavoring into your meal.  But, like I said, trial and error is the nature of the best when trying out new places.

Overall, the place is obviously in its prenatal phase and perfect for the slot player taking a break from 12 straight hours of max play.  Otherwise, I would probably opt for the Chinese spot next door or with the other places in downtown.",2014-02-11 07:04:01

N4f14_PkDGdjY62zA4AEzQ,_uqIpl5tzucKuIlZZPBZRw,CxsN79g8rZoouLwZvr_FVg,4,5,0,0,"After driving past (because of no outdoor signage that's lit), we finally arrived at Fern around 8:30 on Saturday night.  We made our grand entrance through some curtains, stepping right into the dining room and angering the customers nearby who received the cold gust of wind that followed us in.  (They really need a waiting area/host stand and something more than curtains to block the outside from coming inside.)  

We were asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't really think we needed one since it was getting pretty late in the evening for dinner, but apparently it's a very good idea.  Who knew it would be so crowded?  So we made a reservation at that point with the owner and we said we'd come back around 9.  We walked a little ways up the street for a drink at Midwood Smokehouse while we waited.  

We came back around 9, angering customers near the doorway again.  We were taken to a room outside of the dining room which appeared to be the waiting room for Something Classic Catering with a view of the kitchen.  There were a couple of makeshift tables set up in this room for dining guests which seemed a bit tacky because you were basically seated in a hallway.  I would not have been pleased to have been seated there if I were them.  

We were brought water (cucumber water?) by one of the servers while we waited, which was really nice.  Then that same server asked if we wanted to try their warm sangria while we waited.  We figured they were being extra accommodating to us since we were being asked to wait for a table even longer.  The server brought out these huge mugs with warm sangria which was kind of like a hot mulled cider.  It tasted pretty good, but wasn't something I would normally order.  

After we were brought to our table, we were given two copies of their extended past-the-date Queen's Feast menu and only one copy of their regular menu.  Our server politely informed us that they were out of the panini sandwich.  We didn't really want the 3-course meal (actually 4-course here) options, so we had to pass the one regular menu back and forth to share.  We decided we'd share an app and then both get bowls of soup and the only other entree on the menu besides the panini, the veggie burger.  

We ordered and then were informed by the server that they just ran out of the veggie burgers, too.  Huh.  So both entree options were gone, leaving us with just soup, apps, and salad.  I found this very ironic at a vegetarian restaurant.  I'm forever reading complaints from vegetarians that restaurants don't have enough veggie options besides salads and here at a vegetarian restaurant, I see the same thing.  

We ordered the Indian tacos as an app, bowls of the squash soup, and two salads.   At first I thought the Indian tacos would have a curry flavor, but upon closer inspection of the menu before we ordered, I was excited to see that they were actually Native American tacos, made from fry bread, a delicacy we had recently discovered out in Phoenix.  And they were really delicious!  I'd definitely recommend them to anyone, especially if they've never tried fry bread.  

The squash soup was delicious, too.  It was very flavorful and came with some tasty toasted pumpkin seeds on top.  

Last was our salad (our substitute entree).  It looked like Bibb lettuce with feta cheese, cold cubed roasted squash, and more pumpkin seeds.   It was delicious, but was pretty small for the $12 price tag.  Luckily, we were pretty full already from the tacos and soup.  

While we ate, I watched the people at certain tables every time the door opened and they were blasted with the gust of cold air.  They were not having a good time, and I was glad we weren't seated at one of those tables (or the ones out in the hallway!).  

Our server delivered our bill and we were a little (but not too) surprised to find the warm sangria on there at $8 a cup.  We thought it was being given to us a nice, warm gesture, but apparently it was just a sneaky way to upcharge the bill.  (Be forewarned!)  That's when I sucked down the rest of it to get our money's worth.

I think Fern is still going through its growing pains and we hope they make some changes that would really make a fantastic restaurant option, including redefining their dining room spacing and breezeway issue, offering more vegetarian options other than salad and/or not running out of both entree choices (!), and not offering an $8 drink as a ""sample"" and then charging for it.    The food options we did experience were delicious, though.",2012-02-06 15:35:12

Otherwise, I'd never go back! I swear, if this were in New York, it would be something akin to... well, see my review for Hotel Chantelle.

3. Bubbly. Lots of bubbly.

FOOD - 4 Stars
I was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.

After a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.

I attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.

Overall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  

See the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.

Once you're inside, you're awaken with madness regardless what the theme of the expo is.  This place is also huge and you wouldn't know it from the outside. One thing that I like about this convention center compared to the others I've been to is the food selection and the hallway seating.  The Las Vegas Convention Center reminds me of an airport with seating along the walls and food courts in the middle.  This convention center even has a FedEx. This is so convenient for travelers.  Like all other expos, you're walking out with a ton of freebies. Who wants to lug these freebies on a plane? Ship it via FedEx and save the hassle. 

My only issue with this convention center is the outside set up.  Parking is really tough here most of the time. Most people taxi, take the monorail from their hotel, or park across the street.  The parking in the center of the convention center is usually full and price can range from $10 to $20.  If you're going here via Taxi, good luck to you.  Coming in isn't hard, it's the leaving part that is a pain in the butt.  Plan on waiting a long time for your cab since the line usually wraps around. 

Overall, I think like this convention center.  The craziness and madness really depends on what trade show or expo you're going to.  What to expect?  SEMA is tame, CES is crazy, and the Nighclub/Bar expo is right in the middle (i.e. tamed craziness).",2013-03-22 22:02:43

This is almost as good as it get for Las Vegas.  Most of the large establishments on the strip are very good but generic... or what I call crowd pleasers.  The menu here isn't large, but the flavors were excellent.

Server (Monica) was excellent.  They had 2 parties of 25 come in just before us and they managed to get our food to us in a very timely manner... drink too a few seconds longer but she pushed to get ours through before the huge party!  And she didn't have to tell me... I saw it happen.  

Octopus was great.  I was nervous because the pieces were slightly larger so they tend to be tough and chewy sometimes but they were perfectly done.  

I also had the chicken curry, which was wonderful.  Great flavors.  No complaints :)

I really liked the cooks attention to detail and the fact that they didn't really play it too safe.  Most dishes had a variety of flavors (sweet, savory, salty, etc.) which can be hard to do.

There's the ones in strip malls that typically feature a grouchy old man behind the counter and a huge TV displaying Indian MTV or soap operas, and largely do-it-yourself service. (See: Kohinoor)

If I'm feeling like spoiling myself, I'll take the next jump up to the places with painted walls, friendly waitstaff, and a-la-carte style menus instead of ""specials.""

After a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings, me and my beyonce decided to try Indian Delhi Palace, which is an excellent example of the latter.

The waiters were attentive without  being overbearing, and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy, slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy.  And the samosas we started off with were also great.  Not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of Indian places.

The palak paneer is wonderful!  Ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods.  The creamy spinach flavor doesn't become overbearingly hot, but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan, served fresh, of the soft and chewy variety that I prefer.

RE: The people who miss paneer... The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  Anyway, if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food, you might want to mention as such to your server.

The lady ordered vegetable bhriyani, which is sort of our Indian comfort food, and it didn't disappoint.  Flavorful rice with tons of veggies.

I am a big fan of Hong Kong style cafes and am always looking for new ones to try around my neighbourhood. I was quite impressed with the decor of this restaurant. I believe the owner put some thought into the design and it looks different from other HK style cafes. The restaurant looked cleaner and more modern than other HK restaurants. Their menu has a large selection of dishes. 

-- Food and Drink --

We ordered 2 set meals:
1. Baked Meat Sauce and Cheese and rice $8.50 which came with a Russian Borscht soup with an Iced Tea (0.75 extra) 
- The meat sauce was delicious. I liked how it wasn't very sweet. However, I could tell they didn't bake the meat sauce. They only used a culinary blow torch to melt the cheese on top. The portion size was quite big. I could eat this for 2 meals. Their iced tea was very, very sweet. I ordered less ice, less sweet for my iced tea but the drink was still 2/3 filled with ice. 

2. New City Big Bowl Noodle (ÂüéÂ∏ÇÂÖ¨Âè∏Â§ßÁ¢óÈ∫µ) $7.95 with an Iced Tea (0.75 extra)
- The bowl of noodle was very worth it in terms of the quantity. It came with luncheon meat, bacon, ham, double eggs, sausage, B.B.Q. Pork (Chasiu). You could pick any kind of noodle in the soup (macaroni, vermicelli, spaghetti, rice noodle or instand noodle.) My hubby picked the instant noodle. You couldn't find a reason to complain about their portion size.

The beef in the salad was like a lean medium rare kind of roast beef about a hundred times better than the beef like product you get from a Subway Chain place.

I thought this salad lacked blue cheese BUT if I come back I can build it any way I want and will do better.

I didn't care for the pizza. Respectfully I wasn't a fan of the crust, sauce or the cheese.
This crust was very thin and almost cracker like and wasn't like pizza crust to me.
The sauce was seasoned very heavy with too much oregano and was overpowering as I wasn't able to taste the fresh basil on the pie.  (maybe an off batch?) The cheese is OK but it isn't the best.

Guess what? I was amazed today! I got a pretty damned good pedi and mani at Pro Nails, and for $38 (I paid extra five dolla for a callus removal) I am pretty impressed with this place.

Luckily John Mull's was one of the vendors at the Spartan race and I got a chance to meet the owner and try some bbq. When I was complimenting him, he gave me four free dinners to come up and try it out. I can say 1000% I will be MORE than happy to come back on a regular basis and even pay.

A friend of mine and I went last night and I also ordered two extra dinners to bring to my parents' house for lunch today. This gave me an opportunity to try the pulled pork, ribs, chicken, greens beans, coleslaw, baked beans, and yams. I can 100% attest that EVERYTHING was amazing! Even reheated the meat retained much of it's moisture and the flavors are spot on. This place goes on my list as not only the best bbq that I've had in Las Vegas but the best I've had west of the Mississippi. Chuck (owner) definitely knows what he is doing.

I loved the outside venue and since it was such a nice day, it was nice to be outside. We brought beers with us and were able to enjoy them while we waited in line and chatted with the folks around us. There are tons of picnic tables where you can sit and eat or you can take it with you.

The only thing I think some people might see as a negative is that it's in North Las Vegas but I would tell anyone that it's worth the drive. Honestly it's not really that far out. For anyone looking for amazing food from a great guy, I'd recommend this place any day",2016-04-17 20:52:33

This place is double duty since it's a bakery, but they offer savory or sweet in terms of breakfast.  Now it's not an ""all out"" breakfast, but I believe their breakfast sandwiches are made on site with carefully chosen, fresh ingredients that support local produce vendors and farms.  They offer organic coffee and teas - cakes, cupcakes, sheet cakes, and various desserts and treats.  I didn't try their sandwiches, but they looked pretty awesome.

Came here after playing tennis on a Sunday morning, the crowd wasn't too bad and there was a line (ordering at the counter), but the employees were friendly and made sure to warn us how long the wait would be after ordering (just 10min).  We were able to sit outside (along with some furry friends that accompanied their owners to breakfast/coffee that day).  Inside there was a handful of tables and also bar seating along the window so you can watch cars and pedestrian traffic traverse East Blvd on a nice Sunday morning (or whenever you decide to visit).

Breakfast Sandwich #4:  Egg, Bacon & Cheddar on a Cheddar biscuit was my order, and I quickly gobbled it up.  I did have to take a breather since the biscuit (and I saw their croissants) are ginormous... so pace yourself.  Even spoiled myself and tried one of their oreo cookies... I have a weakness for oreos to begin with, but this was like one giant oreo!

I had a craving for sushi, and I've recently begun a quest to try more new places. And when a place with a name like Sushi Time averages four stars, I had to see what it was all about. And, I was not disappointed! 

It's not the best rolls you'll ever have, but Sushi Time is on par with most places in the valley, and A LOT cheaper! Not only are the prices low, but from 6pm to 9pm (close), it's happy hour. Buy a specialty roll, and regular rolls are half off. You also get free hot Saki with your beer. For about $30 We got two beers and Saki (beer only comes in small bottles, but why complain, the Saki wasn't good but it was free), Alaska rolls (really good, but could have used a little more of the mustard sauce), spicy tuna rolls (very good, definitely had a spicier kick than most sushi bars), and spicy salmon rolls (decent, but didn't do it for me). 

The restaurant was empty. My girlfriend and I were one of only two couples there at 8:00 on a Friday night. One other person did come in to pick up a carry out order, but that was it. It may seem strange to people that Sushi Time is in a strip mall and is a quick service restaurant (you order at the register and they bring you your food), but at these prices for this quality, It's worth it. A great place to start your night, especially if you're heading to Mill Avenue or Tempe Market Place. The staff was also very nice, and very accommodating.

It's at Baseline and Rural, near Whole Foods and Jimmy Johns. I actually used to live right across the street from there. If I still did, I would be eating at Sushi Time all the time. Being in Scottsdale now, It's still worth the drive if I want sushi and want to keep the cost low.",2010-10-16 14:34:31

The food was good but not great. It's your typical vendor trucks making mass amounts of food and a lot of it sitting around waiting to be purchased. This would explain why some if the ribs/meats we tried were dry and tasteless. A seafood vendor ""Lobster Muddah""(?) was actually very good. Depending on who you took a gamble on, the food was good or bad. Pizzas were doughy, some meatballs were loaded with bread crumbs. Prices for food were ridiculous. You would have thought you were in a proper restaurant. The covered seating area was adequate during the day but once it got busier in the evening you had to be aggressive to find a place to sit. Entertainment on Saturday was the highlight for us. The Las Vegas Bee Gees played at 5pm and were great. Unfortunately the organizers didn't have a schedule for entertainment at the venue or website, so you were on your own to figure it out. The carnival rides were your typical roadshow of rides and games. Once the sun started going down things got interesting. People were obviously dumping their kids without supervision at the event.

It is owned by Tick, the original owner of Komol.  The Thai restaurant is basically the dining area of the bar.  It's a little smokey, and the bar definitely has a dive sports bar feel to it with a Coors logo of every NFL team lining the room. Surprisingly, one of the pioneers in the Las Vegas Thai food scene has made his return to Vegas in this little bar.  

We ordered the Pad Kee Mao with Pork, the Beef Panang, and the Glass Noodle Salad.  All were entrees and were under $10.  The Pad Kee Mao was out first.  The pork was light and tender, the veggies crisp.  The noodles were a bit heavier than the typical noodle used in this dish.  The sauce was also light, with not a lot of flavor but with a nice balance to it. 

The Beef Panang and the Glass Noodle Salad were my favorite dishes.  Again, both were light in flavor but balanced with authentic ingredients.  The Beef Panang was watery as a good Thai Panang should be, and without peanut sauce.  The spices used did remind me of the Panang at Komol.  I quite enjoyed the flavor of it.  The Glass Noodle Salad was lightly sour, lightly herbed, but it hit all the right spots.  I recommend trying these two dishes.  

Overall this little hidden Thai restaurant is definitely worth a try if you live in the neighborhood.  The heat levels were quite low (we ordered hot, and it was barely spicey), but our server said they have had some problems with customers ordering hot and complaining about it being too hot.  If you can't handle the heat, get out of the Thai restaurant is what I say, but I guess they have a business to run.  She said that now that she knows we can eat spicy, they'll make it Thai hot for us.  

We had a nice little chat with Tick, the owner.  He opened Komol in '79.  The only other Thai restaurant at the time was Kung Fu.  It was a time when people didn't even know what Pad Thai was!  I got a nice little Vegas history lesson on Thai restaurants, and enjoyed his insights.

Service was spot on, attentive and helpful without being overbearing.  Didn't blInk when we asked to split the salad and entree and brought to us In Split portions.

You did NOT understand the situation. You asked me no questions about why we were getting frustrated and did not give your hostess a chance to explain the situation to you. You merely interjected when he came up to the counter upset and then you dismissed us with zero apology. What kind of customer service is that? I might have expected that from a shift manager, which is what I thought you were based on your behavior, but never a restaurant owner. 

What my boyfriend said to your hostess was ""she didn't even offer to put our name down."" Valid complaint. Was his tone the best? Probably not. But we expected basic service which you didn't deliver. You, Mrs. Restaurant owner, are the one to blame for not training your staff well. Your actions were ruder than both my boyfriends and your hostesses actions. Unacceptable. 

We were willing to wait. Like I said, we were excited to come try out your restaurant, but we were not even given the opportunity to wait. Where was the wait time? Neither you nor your hostess gave me that until I had to ask several times. 

The fact that you had two similar instances within the matter of a few days should tell you that there is a problem with your service. Larry probably wanted to wait as well but was not given a chance. Service complaints are so easily rectifiable. Your hostess has had three similar complaints on here in the last two weeks. Train your staff.

Finally, way to go and get your friend, Yvonne, to write a review about your restaurant to counter mine. Very professional. Just like your response. Zero friends, two reviews, the other one for your failed restaurant, Cuttlefish? Nice try.

People - don't waste your time here. You can get a better Bloody Mary cart at The Henry. A better breakfast at Butterfields. And better service anywhere else.

I'll be back to taste again.

Descriptions of really good ice cream seem clich√©:  rich, creamy, smooth, clean, flavorful.  But even so, they apply.  They make their ice cream and sorbet from quality ingredients, from scratch.

In terms of drinks, I began with a mojito (nothing special, tasted exactly like the mojito should, but I was too shy/scared to order the Asian Caesar), and the table finished by sharing a bottle of wine.

For appetizers, we started off with the Singaporean slaw. I can honestly say that this was my favourite dish of the night, complete with different textures (loved the taro, peanuts and carrots) and flavours (salty and sweet). Then came the oyster sake shots, which I found too salty. The beef carpaccio was next, which were quite unforgettable. Then the tuna tataki... which I would have enjoyed without the overwhelming sauce, but it was nevertheless okay.

For mains, we shared the tuna and watermelon ceviche, which was certainly interesting with the spicy mayo like sauce and sweet watermelon cubes. Fairly refreshing! There was also the lion head tempura, but I found the batter of the tofu slightly too thick. The scallops with sundried tomato crust were delicious and tasty! Then came the onion rings with mint chutney and yogurt, and I wasn't a fan of the sauce (I prefer things lighter in flavour). Finally, the long awaited lamb chops, and I absolutely loved the taste as well. Those banana fritters were scrumptious!

We finally ended with dessert, consisting of two items. One was similar to a Chinese tong yuan, chewy and rich in sesame flavour, with a nice kick of tangy fruit. The other was an unset creme brulee in a crispy dish like pastry, into which we poured some sweet apricot nectar.

Onto the food...

Calamari - not good, very little flavor. A little salt in the batter would've made a big improvement. The marinara sauce was good so it made the dish edible, but without it, the calamari would've been tasteless.

Wild Mushroom Ravioli - outstanding! Perfectly cooked and seasoned with a hint of truffle. 

Shrimp Parmesan - not what we were expecting, it's like chicken Parmesan but with shrimp. The shrimp is battered and fried with melted cheese on top.

Gnocchi Bolognese - again, sauce was good but the gnocchi had no flavor. Maybe they ran out of salt in the kitchen?? I asked my husband if he tricked me by taking me to a ""healthy"" restaurant (read: no salt, no flavor). The gnocchi was cooked well, but I was disappointed.

Although she listed Postino Wine Cafe, I was brought to this location and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection and provided great service.  The cork on my bottle of Pinot Noir had ""Wine Crystals"" or Wine Diamonds"", nothing I had seen before.  The server was very informative on explaining what it was, turns out I did my own research and the information provided was very accurate.  http://winesworld.com/index.php/wine-crystals/68/

It's in the Ballantyne Village which is a little tricky to get into and out of, but if you go early you can miss the crowds.  Once it gets busy, that place gets hectic!

The set up here is similar to Subway in that you can essentially build your own pita by picking any toppings and sauces you want and watching the folks behind the glass put it together for you.  There is a huge sign on the back wall that you cannot miss that gives you the nutrition info on all of their pitas as well, so you can have an idea of exactly what you're about to scarf down.  If you're a Ballantyne Corporate Card holder, you can add a drink and chips for free.  That's a pretty sweet perk.  

I've eaten here many a time and have always enjoyed it.  The Thai chicken is my favorite, and the Chicken Souvlaki is also really good.

The ahi poke tostadas were good, nothing out of this world. The tostada was nice and crispy and the avocado aioli was perfectly portioned for each serving. I am used to fresh-off-the-boat Florida seafood so I guess I should give Vegas a little slack in that department considering you can't catch tuna in the middle of the desert.

   Since I wasn't incredibly hungry I ordered the dulce de leche swirl cheesecake to go. I ended up having this for breakfast the next morning so I most definitely enjoyed the corn flakes garnish.

I used to go to the Institute all the time when I lived here previously so I didn't really have any hesitation in booking again. I went in for a demi color + gloss and a cut ($70 total). When I wasn't shown what color they were going to use, I should have spoken up or asked more questions- so I take partial blame. I had pictures of what I was trying to achieve and I have used demi + gloss previously but now my natural red hair is brown. It only looks red in direct light. My goal had been to brighten up my natural red color - I even had a photo of the Aveda color swatch from my previous stylist but they (student and instructor) didn't seem like they cared to see it. So I am VERY disappointed in the color (yes, I did shed a few tears for the red that is no more) and already have something booked elsewhere once this grows out/fades. If they had told me how dark my hair would go, I would have just gotten a cut and been on my way. 

My cut is okay on length but I did not get as many layers as I wanted. My stylist had been there for almost a year and wasn't very chatty so there was a lot of awkward silence. I tried to chat a little but maybe she was just focusing. The instructor who checked on things seemed to be all over the place (busy).

Instantly when you walk in you're greeted by the smell of fresh seafood so be prepared to get a little fishy- however they do have two outdoor patios. 

I always opt for their tacos with the jalape√±os grits. One thing I love about them-They stuff the tacos!!!! They are huge! Plus, they always have delicious specials with my favs being the jalape√±o grouper and the spicy pineapple Mahi. On the drinks end, they have $1 mystery beers and pretty cheap mixed drinks ($5-$7). 

Overall, Krazy Fish is a great low-key place to try! If you're ever bored just come and check out their krazy decor inside and outside on the front patio! It's Krazzzzzy weird.

My boyfriend had a $15 seitan hoagie that was good, but not, you know, Spak-Brothers-Good. Also my fancy grilled cheese could have been fancier, and elevated by addition of another type of cheese or a few more veggies to make it a bit less Basic.  I like the fried sage on it, though, and the salad that came with it was super-yum.  

I have to give Prairie huuuge props for their solid vegetarian selection!

The silver lining for this place is their wings. As many others have said in their reviews, their wings are pretty damn good. If you skip out on the wings, you will probably be curious as to why this place is always packed (pro tip, get the Korean BBQ flavor). 

The drinks...I ordered an old fashioned, which is pretty hard to mess up, but boy did they mess it up. After 10 minutes the waiter brings out what looks to be someone's drink that had 2 sips left, to which I asked ""is this someone else's drink?"". He laughed and replied with ""that's just how it comes"". $13 in the hole for this crap; I was not laughing. It was a watered down mess. I think a nun that's never had a sip of alcohol in her life could probably make a better one. The beer I ordered was also a joke, brought out in a 10oz plastic cup and charged $6 for. $20 later and didn't even have a buzz. 

The rest of the food is certainly different and I think it just tries too hard. Their version of chili cheese fries are the kimchi fries. It's a muddled mess of flavor that doesn't mesh well with french fries. Their version of ""burgushi"" from Cowfish is not exciting at all. Bulgogi beef with no flavor that's wrapped in rice and kelp is just a terrible idea. If you have to put a warning on the menu about it ""not being sushi"", then it's probably indicative of something that's just a bad idea all around.

The restaurant faces Kennedy, but hidden from view if you're inside the plaza. Parking is a pain in the neck as there is only one row of parking directly in front of Moji. The seating is well spaced and simplistic and adds to the charm of the dainty restaurant. 

I ordered the Spicy Mayo Buta Don and was pleasantly surprised with the complementary miso soup, which was steaming hot and not overly salty. The Japanese rice was well portioned but those with a bigger appetite may still find themselves not completely satisfied (more room for dessert?). The pork was well seasoned and tender, and I enjoyed the spicy mayo which added just a tiny bit of kick. The takoyaki took a little longer to arrive but was freshly made and had sizable chunks of octopus.

We also ordered drinks (peach calpis tea) and the soft serve green tea ice cream. The cold beverage was unremarkable but we thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream. The green tea flavor was strong and at $3, inexpensive.

The verde shrimp tacos come with ripe buttery slices of avocado and the verde sauce adds a citrusy fresh note that really is something I could eat everyday. Their pride and joy, the fish taco was lightly coated in a flavorful, light, mildly airy batter that is a bit greasy but sinfully good.

Since I was entering from the east side going west, I had to get creative and turn left and then right into the back of the Starbucks. From there, the drive through line was fairly long, so I looped around the small parking lot, pulled into a Handicap space and then backed out into the back of the drive through line. 

From there, I ordered a Venti Strawberry A√ßa√≠ Refresher and a Blueberry Oatmeal. I forgot to ask for light ice for the refresher but I'm still slowly drinking it so it was made fairly well. Similarly, the oatmeal also had a good amount of water. Keep in mind that this place offers fresh blueberries (although I personally do enjoy the dried blueberries a little more.)

First impression as I walked in was, this place looks like those fast food places you see in Hong Kong in the 90s, but once you actually observe the setting carefully, you can see the owner decided to go with this design on purpose.  Everything seems VERY out of place but very hipster.

Food wise, my friend and I ordered the Gyu Don (Beef rice), Curry chicken udon and Wasamayo Takoyaki.  I was very impressed with the takoyaki and udon.  Takoyaki was done to perfection, very crispy on the outside and flavourful on the inside, although the wasabi mayo wasn't strong enough.

Udon was very good, although i would prefer other flavours than the curry because it just tasted like those Japanese curry cube you get in supermarket.  The udon itself was VERY chewy which i LOVE.  The rice on the other hand, if there was more sauce it would be better.

The thing I didn't really like about this place was the service. We walked in and there were 3 associates standing around that didn't say a word to us. They just looked at us and continued gossiping to one another. Yeah, the puppies do look sad, but it's so much worse at actual animal shelters and the kennels were actually very clean when I went in. The prices seem pretty steep for the puppies, but I haven't been to very many pet shops in town, so I don't know what the normal rates should be. The store also has other pets like ferrets, fish, hamsters, birds, turtles, etc. They have a pretty nice setup for the Red Ear Sliders in the back and there's plenty of them to keep each other company.

Overall, I think this store is okay. I definitely wouldn't buy anything here, just because I can find everything cheaper elsewhere, but I'd come in just to look at the pets and get ideas of different supplies to get for my turtles.",2012-01-09 10:05:00

MqERaNF8DdtsFrLwRsjVwQ,RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,LJt-NO2FhvQxTmBoaaLhTg,2,5,4,0,"Last Sunday my husband and I went to Three Angry Wives Irish Pub in Summerlin specifically to get a sandwich that was recommended to us. This was the Chicken Cobbler Ciabatta ($9.99)- breaded chicken breast topped with cobbler baked apple slices, dried cranberries, cheddar cheese, lettuce, and honey Dijon sauce - sounds intriguing, doesn't it? I am a fan of the Bobbie sandwich at Capriotti's, which is basically Thanksgiving on a hoagie, so I was looking forward to trying a similar version here. Well, this was the perfect example of how sometimes something can sound good in theory but in reality, or in the hands of the wrong person, becomes a failure. In this case the sandwich was not totally without merit, but left plenty of room for improvement nonetheless. It seems appropriate to make a compliment sandwich for the Chicken Cobbler by pointing out something positive, followed by its problems, and finishing on another high note.

Dear Sandwich,
The ciabatta bread you were served on was fresh and performed it's job well. Unfortunately, you were too sweet and one dimensional. Your apples weren't necessarily a bad choice but the 'cobbler' didn't work for me. Additionally, I would like to see you served with crispy chicken that wasn't fried thirty minutes ago when I placed my order but not delivered until now. I hold this more against the slow kitchen and servers than you, so don't feel too bad. At least your chicken was still juicy. Finally, I'd like to commend you on your choice of plate partner - I very much enjoyed the fries!
Sincerely, Frugal Foodie

In addition to the sandwich, we had a bowl of chicken and dumpling soup ($5.99), which was flavorful but a little too thick. I won't quite compare it to gravy but it was moving in that direction. Ian also had a Bloody Mary that was one of the better he's had in town. The award for top Bloody Mary goes to Hash House, and is the only reason to ever step foot in that restaurant (Hash House exemplifies everything that is wrong with dining in America by encouraging people to eat enough food for a week in one sitting).

As I mentioned in my letter to Sandwich, the kitchen was ridiculously slow and the servers were sweet but not entirely competent. It took ten minutes to order our food and another thirty five to get it out, and this was on a Sunday morning in a Pub. I'd be weary of going back during peak times. My soup wasn't hot when it came out and we overheard the kitchen staff gripe, so I wasn't left with the best taste in my mouth (or maybe that was their spit?). Overall, we walked out of Three Angry Wives as Two Semi-Angry Customers, and will not likely be returning for the mediocre pub food.",2010-03-27 14:30:17

There over all transaction was ""alright"". It's the typical back and forth, here and there waiting kinda game. I have been to Acura dealer and Carmax in the last 12 months and bought cars on each dealer. So far I can tell you that Honda West is the worst when it comes to giving you interest rate. How can you bargain the interest? At least Acura was honest to give me the lowest based on my down payment. Carmax shows you upfront what the bank will give you and interest goes even lower as you increase your downpayment. I was able to negotiate a 2.9% interest with a significant downpayment. I know that's high still and I let it go since I don't intend to keep the loan very long and able to pay it sooner. It just shows you the simple way they would haggle even they say that's their ""sonic"" price, sure. They asked me what would make me happy to buy the car. I agreed to my terms and even bump up my trade in value (which Carmax is happy to give me $300 more, it just doesn't make sense to trade my car there and go back to Honda West, I wanted a clean and fair trade) after all that and more waiting, they come up with additional $150 for not providing my trade title. I had to give in to that because we're so buried in time and just want to get out of there. Just like any dealership, know what you want and prepare to be there for a while.... to make things worst, I drove with a quarter of a tank in gas. Is that normal for a dealer to do now on a car sales?! Oh well, dealer never loose right?!.",2016-10-17 14:06:53

I was meeting some family here for breakfast before they headed home to California.  It was very busy on this day.  We stood on line for a while before finally being seated.  Apparently there was a big convention being held on this weekend.  Because the place was so busy it took a while for our food to come out.  We had planned on a 9:30 breakfast.  We ate closer to 10:30.  

Across the table various food items were ordered.  My aunt got California Benedict and seemed to enjoy it.  My grandma and cousin both got a scambled egg and toast.  It seemed perfectly average as a boring meal like that should be.  I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak.  It was alright.  There was a lot of cheese which I appreciate.  The meat was perhaps a bit dry for my liking but the sandwich was elevated over all by the onions, mushrooms, and bell pepper.  I especially enjoyed the mushrooms.  So many places don't serve mushrooms on their cheese steaks and I love mushrooms.  For my side I ordered potato salad.  It was fine picnic style.  Nothing remarkable.

A coupon was used at the end of the meal to order a dessert.  We got a slice of carrot cake.  This was good carrot cake too.  You could see the fresh carrots throughout.  The spice level was spot on.  There was a good helping of chopped walnuts both in the cake and on the frosting.  The frosting did not tast much like cream cheese as I like but it was fine.  The whole thing was topped with a drizzle of caramel sauce.  Oh, did I mention this was a huge slice of cake?  Three or four layers and a nice wide slice.

Since we had a group of 5, we ordered the regular sized Mixed Paella to start since it was going to take awhile, and just ordered a bunch of tapas to share.  Even though on the menu it shows the paella's portion is for two, with all the tapas we ordered, turned out to be a smart choice.  

The paella came loaded with seafood.  Paella's tasty and it definitely hit the spot for us.  Can't really compare to ""authentic"" paella, but for what it is, pretty good!  One of my friend mentioned that the seafood wasn't as fresh as it could be, which is understandable since Vegas is in the middle of the desert haha.  My only knock on it would probably be the super small lobster tail.

As for the tapas, there were a few standouts.  The Black Rice is my favorite: squid Ink rice/risotto with calamari and lobster, with a heavy touch on garlic, which I liked.  Others that stood out were the White Ceviche, which was refreshing, and the Apple Foie, which is a mini apple roasted with a chunk of foie in the middle.  C'mon.

The Fresh Calamari a la Plancha was a surprise.  Essentially grilled calamari, but done perfectly.  The Beef Tartare here has an interesting presentation.  Tasty too to match the good looks. 

Pan Tomate was a disappointment and didn't care much for the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers.  

We ordered a pitcher of red sangria to share, which was good for about 8-9 glasses.  Solid solid sangria.

In addition to hot foods, they have an extensive bakery, meat and cheese counter, all of which have a huge variety of products at fairly reasonable prices. 

The store itself is absolutely MASSIVE, and if I'm honest, I'm still not used to the layout even though the store has been open for a few years now. There are plenty of checkouts and the lines move fast. I also love the coffee shop at the front which has a large seating area and microwaves to heat up your meal from the take-out counter.

Another huge plus is the LCBO upstairs, which means you can grab a few groceries and some booze on your way home, or pick up some supplies on your way to a party. The ultimate in convenience!

Finally, I love how you can suggest foods that you would like them to stock. Although I'm sure they can't grant everyone's requests, it's nice to know that your voice is heard. A solid four stars!",2014-10-02 20:31:57

Okay, I packed up the kids and headed for Lee Lee's Market.  As I turn into the parking lot I saw the Noodle House.  ""You guys want to have noodles for lunch?""  I asked my niece, nephew and son.

""Yes!""  they replied.  Almost all kids love noodles.  I only know of one kid that does not like any type of noodle or pasta.   We were seated right away.  My niece informs me that the table smelled funky.  I had them re-wipe it once more.  Then out comes the boiled peanuts and sweet pickled daikon and carrots.  That explains it!

Hours of boiling soup bones lend to the beefy broth of the ox tail soup loaded with ramen, baby spinach and other greens.   Not much meat, but I really like the broth.  The seafood soup consisted of shrimp, bay scallops, fried fish balls, squid, ramen noodles, spinach and other greens and herbs.

I came here while in the University Heights area to do some errands, as I heard good things from a classmate of mine.  It fulfills my needs of being a convenient, fast-food-ish, affordable place that serves Italian food, which happens to be a frequent craving of mine.  The serving format is similar to a Chipotle, where there is an assembly line of people putting together a piada/bowl with your choice of pasta vs. no pasta, meat, sauce, and veggies.  The piada itself is similar to a burrito, where I tortilla-like bread is wrapped around your meat/other ingredients.  With some help from the staff, I opted not for the piada itself, but instead for a bowl with the tortilla inside, along with pasta, some cooked zucchini/peppers, fried calamari, tomato sauce, and some tomato and artichoke scattered on top.  The final product was a giant pasta bowl, which was delicious, and enough for two meals.  With both the bowl and my drink, the total was still under $10.  Again, awesome.  The staff themselves were very friendly and ready to help, which is always a blessing at a new restaurant.  Perhaps the service could have been quicker, but I am willing to overlook that since they were so helpful and friendly.

I realize now that I was spoiled by this location. I also realize I've been giving away 5 star reviews more liberally the last few years and back when I reviewed this as a 4, I was a lot tougher of a critic on places. Since I wrote the original review below, I have been to Chicago and have eaten at all of the famous deep dish places, and this Rosati's beats em. I'm not kidding. 

Now the owner of this location has been here for years now, and he has done a fantastic job of staying consistent and awesome. I heard that new franchise owners go here to train. Not all Rosati's are created equal. Some are not up to par, but this location is the gold standard as far as I'm concerned. 

Even though I moved out of range for this location, the one near my house was not that great - so when I got the craving, I would go miles out of my way to get pizza here. Perfect every single time. I've now moved again and am even further away - the Rosati's near my house is from the Corporate side, and is also really solid so I may not go as far out of my way as often anymore, but I still will occasionally. 

Think of it this way - Rosati's prices aren't cheap, and most locations don't really have a sit-down experience that the food really deserves. This means to me that the ingredients quality is high. At locations where they stick with the program, it definitely is. This is one of them. Again - in my opinion, this is the gold standard for this franchise. 

I'm upping it to 5 stars - and these are well deserved. I'm only sorry that I let this location sit at 4 stars for so long. 

3/22/2009 - Rosati's is under new ownership. Apparently, it was going downhill fast under the previous owner near the end. Now it seems to have been rescued and revamped. 

I haven't been inside, but I did order some delivery yesterday. I got a 12"" Chicago style pizza... it was pretty damn good. It was a little spendy, but I'd say it was worth it. It fed me for two days. The pizza arrived hot, and the box it came in was actually pretty fancy for a pizza box. 

Their menu is pretty nice. I spoke with the owner when I called to order and he told me about what he's been doing. He's definitely trying to raise the bar and elevate this place to another level. I think he said he bought a few other spots as well. 

Since it's a little more pricey than Mama Mia's, I don't know how often I'll order from here, but it's a nice alternative. If you're a fan of Chicago pizza - this seems to be a solid place to get it.

I'll update this review after I've eaten here a few more times.

Edit: Okay, after eating here a few times, I'll say that I love their toppings, but the bread they use sucks. The pasta isn't terribly amazing either. It's good though. The delivery is fast and it arrives really hot and fresh. I'm still keeping it at 4 stars.",2009-03-22 23:55:06

My SUV had a rear window regulator that went out.  After getting a quote from my old mechanic (chain) while i had it in for a LOF, and practically falling out of my seat, I said that i could live without rolling that window down for a while.  A few months later, the glass slipped all the way down and unless i wanted to have the wind blowing through my sons hair in the backseat and potentially have critters/cats making a nighttime home out of my vehicle, I had to do something fast.  

I called Whitey's and Mike gave me a quote over the phone.  The quote was $100 less for the same repair the chain wanted.  I told Mike, ""When can I bring it in!?"" I had my SUV back in less than a day.  

While I'm pretty car savvy (having worked for a car dealership/parts dept and had to maintain my own work truck), auto repairs is an area that history shows women can and have be taken to the cleaners.

The waffles are very rich and hold a great texture. You can order your waffle plain, with powdered sugar, with maple or chocolate sauce, with ice cream, with fruits, or all of the above. I decided to just about do all of the above. 
I ordered a waffle with maple sauce, ice cream and strawberries. Aside from strawberries they have blackberries, raspberries, bananas and probably a couple other fruit toppings. I must say the waffle definitely hit the spot, it was made ready to order and the ice scream scoop and amount of strawberries was more that I thought I'd get, but then again it did cost about $8 everything in. 

I've had waffles in Belgium and I must say that this experience did not quite match up to my experiences over in Brussels, but at the same time it was not all that bad either.

I rarely order steak or fish because for the price, I'm usually happier cooking both at home. I dove into the carb pool and had the Proscuitto Pizza. It was really tasty, but the crust was too thick for my liking. My friend's nachos were massive, but only the top layer of fried flour tortillas are covered in toppings.

This is the 4th French restaurant I tried in Montreal, and I do think it's the best one, at least out of the 4 I tried. I really like the ambience and setting of this restaurant, given the location in Old Montreal. It really does give the French-style dining feel that's quite common in these kinds of restaurants. 

There are three types of menus here: A la carte, table d'hote, and the tasting menu. Unlike many reviews here, I actually went with a la carte...not a fan of the whole tasting menu concept, and I do have an okay idea of what to expect for French cuisine.

My family ordered the french onion soup, lobster bisque, smoked duck breast, escargots, vanilla flavoured shrimp, rack of lamb, and the veal chop. We finished off with a chocolate chip souffl√© and a cheesecake.

Where do I start...for the soups, the lobster bisque is definitely strong in the lobster fragrance category. I felt the taste was a bit light, but nothing too terrible about it. The french onion soup isn't the type with baked cheese on top, so do keep that in mind. I'd stick with the lobster bisque next time. Smoked duck breast, escargots, and vanilla flavoured shrimp were all uniquely presented and equally delicious. The rack of lamb was grilled perfectly, while the veal chop was a little bit more rare than what we requested (medium rare vs. medium).

The desserts are a must here. Both the cheesecake and souffl√© were some of the best I had; I definitely recommend the souffl√© at the very least, even if it's a 15 minute wait.

Service is excellent, all servers are bilingual. Of course, as common courtesy, do attempt to at least speak a bit of French.

Will definitely recommend to my friends!",2017-01-07 16:06:19

But mainly, the Tire Center and Pharmacy drag the rating down significantly.

I have both my prescription and the Costco prescription plans, and have inadvertently overpaid when the less expensive plan was not used. It seems like it would be an easy process to check which plan would save their members the most, and bill accordingly. So when this happens they have to re-run it, which slows down the line. There also is NEVER enough front-end help at the pharmacy, so in my experience there is always a line. My wife has also found it challenging to get a prescription filled the same day, which is standard service at the retail pharmacies. 

The Tire Center has never given me satisfactory service. When they mounted my new tires they scratched my rims and I could not hold them accountable even though no damage was noted on the check-in form.  Rotations were so hard to get done due to 2-3 hour wait times, that I paid other shops to do them for me. Finally, yesterday I was told my rear tires were ""shot"" and that because my rotations were further than ""6,000 to 8,000 miles apart"" the warranty would not be honored. I feel that if they are going to be so strict on that I should be informed upon purchase. I had a similar issue with my wife's car and Discount Tire went to bat for me and we worked out a pro-rated replacement cost. But Costco was unwilling to work with me in the least, which is surprising since their satisfaction guarantee is so comprehensive for retail items.

I have one last point, but it did not come into my rating criteria but is worth mentioning as a public service: I'm fairly certain my wife's car was hit in the parking lot, and when I called to ask to see security tapes, I was told there are no external cameras on the lot. I surmise that the ""Bait Car Program"" signs scattered through the lot are there to instill a false sense of security for your car. I also only thought to ask for footage because I know someone who had a similar incident at Sam's Club and they DID have footage that helped the police.

The benedicts are out of this world. I had the crab cake benedict, and it was amazing. It was packed with fresh crab and the hollandaise was savory with just a touch of lemon. I actually added avocado to mine, which I think completed the flavor.

Coffee is served in individual tall French presses, finished at the table. Very nice touch! The coffee they use is organic Lavazza coffee from Italy. Lavazza just happens to be my favorite,  because it has such a mild, nutty flavor with a hint of chocolate without any bitterness. 

The brisket hash will have you drooling, it was so good. They smoke the brisket in house,  since they own the BBQ place next door. The flavor complimented the scrambled eggs we had, which we also added cheese to.

Located at Scotia Plaza I'm not surprised it's been considered one of the go-to places for after work food and drinks.  Every day Speaks has a special, so there's always something to look forwards to.
Our server was extremely, genuinely polite given this part of the downtown that can get quite pretentious. For drinks, since it was Friday,  we took advantage of their $4 bottles of beer..awesome! 

appetizers we shared their in house made beef tartar which was delightful to your taste buds.  Presentation was lovely,  pieces of meat were cut very small, however instead of them serving chips, it would have bee  better of they substituted it with crostini. 4/5

For main I ordered their one of their popular; fried chicken club, yum! Portion was big, satisfying and delish. This dish came with a house salad which added some healthy element to the dish lol!

Extra information:

*Big portions
*huge communal tables
*Busy at lunch crowd
*Vegetarian option Avail
*Hidden menu option

They are located close to Dundas Square on the second floor on Yonge Street and it could be easy to miss since they don't have a huge sign outside. But keep your eyes open and you will see the menu outside the door where the elevator is located.

As I am writing this review, I've been back 3 times (at least) so far but the first time I went, it was for lunch on a Saturday. Thanksfully I went early enough so there was no wait and we got one of the few booths avail.

Ordered: PAPAYA SALAD 1/5
*Green papaya with Thai dressing for $5
*Had the best papaya salad in Thailand last summer so I was excited to see this on the menu
*When this first arrived, I was confused for a second and thought maybe they took my order wrong
*This had strips of papaya with tomato, peanut bits, dried shrimp and lime juice
*This was basically pieces of papaya drenched in lime juice
*It was just very sour with the lime juice and I couldn't taste any garlic or peanuts
*Original papaya salad should be bursting with different flavors of garlic, peanuts, fish sauce and cilantro
*They were just doing it completely wrong and I don't know if people actually enjoy this cause it was horrible
*I would never ever get this again and even if they gave it to me for free, I wouldn't eat it

Ordered: BEEF SATAY SKEWERS 3/5
*4 skewers for $5
*These are made with thin beef slices instead of beef cubes
*served with thick peanut sauce which was good but it had this weird color
*Peanut sauce was more so mustardy-mayoy than peanut butter
*Meat had good flavor but it was so thin I feel like this dish could be cheaper

Ordered: GREEN CURRY WITH CHICKEN 3.5/5
*Served with jasmine rice for $8.75
*Green curry had chicken, green bean, broccoli and basil
*Curry itself wasn't too creamy but it had good coconut flavor
*As I was scooping some up to have it with my rice, I found the curry to be too runny
*It came with lots of chicken pieces but near the end, I had too much curry compared to the rice

Ordered: ISLAMIC NOODLES 5/5
*This is their not so secret 'secret menu' that was super popular when they were open at last location
*It's not on the menu, but if you ask they will make it for you (and you def want to ask for this!)
*Pad Thai noodles drenched in coconut curry for $10.50
*Came with 4-5 shrimp and chicken pieces on top
*The sauce is creamy with a bit of kick which was perfect with the noodles
*Lots of veggies (green pepper and red pepper) were on top
*I could def taste lots of spice in this particular dish
*I really enjoyed this and understand why it's one of their most popular dish

Overall there was a good service, our server was Rob who wasn't over the top friendly, but was attentive and filled up our water when needed. That's more than good enough at busy restaurants like this especially at usy lunch hour.

After my first visit, I went back couple more times and I will just include my comments about the dishes within this posting.

Ordered: MINIATURE SHRIMP ROLLS 4/5
*10 mini shrimp spring rolls for $4.50
*This is perfect as an appetizer in terms of taste, portion and price
*They are nothing special and you coulod probably get them anywhere but for $4.50, it's perfect for sharing
*It's filled with shrimp inside and goes very well with the sweet plum sauce

Ordered: THAI FRIED RICE 3/5
*Fried rice with eggs, shrimp, chicken, carrots, onions and curry sauce
*Tasted just like any other Chinese fried rice but with hint of curry
*I needed hot sauce for this dish cause it was kind of bland and dry
*It was nothing special and I probably won't get this again

Ordered: THAI BASIL NOODLE 3.5/5
*Rice noodles stir fried with veggies and shrimp with garlic, chili, shallows and dried shrimp sauce
*This was just another version of Pad Thai for me, except with the tomato-ey ketchupy taste
*Again, some basil leaf thrown on top...is it suppose to work as garnish?
*Thai food is usually known for dishes with lots of complex flavors altogether but this was very bland
*It was decent, but I much prefer the Islamic noodles I had last time

Summary: I've been to Salad King about 3 times so far and I really do like it. Now I know what to order and what's good here. I recommend going early if you are dropping by for lunch and don't expect to have a important conversation here because it gets super loud due to their low ceiling. I recommend, Mini Shrimp Spring rolls, Beef/Chicken skewers and Islamic Noodles(yum!)",2011-11-08 00:02:12

My mind was thinking fast and remembered I've always seen Duff's wings by the La Fitness and never went there. So I said it out loud and le boyfriend was like SURE! (Oddly enough he is extremely picky about his wings however for the fact that he has never been there he was intrigued)

Fast forward, he got the special $31.95 - 2lbs of wings (medium and buffalo sauce on the side), large fries and a small pitcher of fountain beverage. I just got a 1lb of hot and honey. They asked if we wanted carrots OR celery, blue cheese OR dill. Obviously celery and dill was the choice we took. 

The celery came first and le boyfriend doesn't like dips, however he wanted to try it out. He said it was delicious (took me by surprise). The wings and fries came out. They were nicely sized, temperature wise hot and CRISPY! So far so good. Mine, the hot and honey were very scrumptious =) No complaints there. For le boyfriend, he killed his 2lbs and stated that this may be a top contender for wing nights. 

The service was great! Even though it wasn't busy they were fully staffed and our waitress checked up on us at the right times. The atmosphere while walking in was so welcoming as well. Something I don't usually experience at wing places so it basically ""... had me at hello"" haha.  

One downfall - NOT unlimited refills -- however that's why they have the options: Glass / Small Pitcher (about two glasses) / Large Pitcher. 

I definitely will be recommending this establishment to anyone looking for a wing night!",2017-05-30 03:16:10

Yes, they are pricey, but have you ever had a fluffy, light, amazing OMFG cheesecake? It exists here.

Otherwise you can go eat cheap imitations at Leah's Bakery or Richtree and groan to yourself that you're eating a dense, possibly modified-cream-cheese-filled kind of cake that makes you wish you hadn't even bothered and went to Carole's Cheesecake instead.

Super light, fluffy, yummy. I practically licked the plate. 

Tip: Head to Whole Foods on Avenue Road if you want to pick up some cheesecake from Carole's for slightly cheaper. I found slices there for $4.99 although you (obviously) do not have the breadth of choice that is offered at the cafe.

We found a table and waited not even ten minutes and our first pie was out of the oven and on our table.  The margarita was really terrific.  A nice crust with a little char on top.  The chorizo was just as good.  It was not overly spicy and the sprouted grain crust gave off a mild nutty flavor that I found complimentary.  Maybe not so much for the margarita or the pesto, but it worked on this pie.  We did not get the honey that some other yelpers indicated they received, but we'll be sure to get some next time around.

Half of the menu is unavailable, pizzas, stromboli's, breakfast, prime rib, etc, after 9pm.  Probably means in restraurant speak ""we already cleaned the ovens"".  Since there are about four other things you can order...maybe this place should have a late night menu. We ordered boneless wings, a chicken wrap, prime rib sandwich, and a cheese quesadilla. How long did our food take?  Long enough to get hangry.  Probably 45 minutes. Did they make each thing individually? Were they learning to how to fold a tortilla origami style for the chicken wrap? Did they order takeout to be delivered from across Clark County? Nobody knows.  Our server who was also the bartender was one adjective above surly and bordering on rude.

Free valet was a wonderful option that the restaurant provides and we took it. The valet guy was great, prompt and honest as my husband left his brand new cell phone in plain view in the console and it was not touched.
Walked inside and WOW, the place is much larger than it looks from the outside, cavernous almost!
We were seated way at the back at 530pm (with resos) in a cave-like area as the ceilings were lower in that spot. I liked it, and I liked that at first we were the only diners in at that point. It did fill up by 8pm or so, good crowd.
I personally loved the red, old school, gangster feel to the place. I had it all built up in my head from what I had read from on-line reviews and it did not disappoint.
Our server was older, reserved, polite but in all honesty, I felt like he would have rather been doing cartwheels on the moon than serve tables this evening.
Our friends had been before and pointed out to us the menu area of Emperor's Feast where you get a steak/entree, bread to start along with a garden salad, your choice of dressing) and a little French Onion soup. For me, it was a lot of food and I brought home half my entree but I chose the wrong cut of steak for this restaurant. I was so looking forward to being able to ""cut the meat with my butter knife"" but on the NY Strip, this did not happen and my friend beside me also was disappointed in how tough hers was. She said it could have been an off day or bad meat selection as she has had the strip before here and said it was terrific. The men at the table scored with their steaks, those being a rib eye and the 10oz Filet. Both sumptuous, I got to try both and nothing needed additional seasoning. The server seemed to understand the trouble with the strips and his manager was nice enough to take $15 off each steak without us even asking for compensation of any kind. Classy. This review would have garnered a 4 or 4.5 if the meat had been a nicer cut, but the cookery itself was spot on. I loved how I could see the steak grilling from our table, outside the kitchen.
I loved the little details of this place - like how the salad plates were stone cold as they should be and the dinner plates were hot. The soup was OK, salad great and the bread was fantastic. My friend beside me went into orbit over their parm cheesy bread, a nice twist on fresh Texas Toast. I preferred the garlic toast included in the basket but both rated as excellent. Refills of the bread were no problem.
The table did not love how the skinny glasses of pop at almost $4 each did not include refills. But, the meals were a great value starting at $38 for the rib eye.
We would absolutely go back just for the originality of the place but I am sure there are other steakhouses in Calgary to try first.

It's located inside the Cosmopolitan.  From the casino floor, take one of the elevators to the second level, and you can't miss it.  Like the rest of the Cosmo, it has an upscale feel and look to it.  

Apparently, some nights they have a DJ, and some they don't.  We experienced both.  It was great both ways.  Having the DJ added an interesting, fun twist to our second meal, but it was never so loud you could not easily converse with your dining companions.  

The staff here are very well trained, friendly, and professional.  Even when we were dressed a bit down for the Cosmo, we were treated warmly by everyone we dealt with.  The service was terrific.  

The food is really, really good.  I would put it on even footing with if not superior footing to BLT in the Mirage, which is a high compliment.

I drove from Henderson toward  Lone Mountain to go hiking. On the way to the hike, I decided to stop at the Cliff Shadows at the 215 Chevron convenience store for water. Owing to the fact that the parking lot was filled up, I drove to the back of  Chevron then  into the parking lot for a small shopping center. In this small shopping center, I spotted Dragon Wok. 

  I was debated on delaying the hike and trying one of their lunch special. My original intention was to return to Chicago Brew Pub after the hike. Dragon Wok wasn't exactly breaking the Yelp ratings record. The ratings were low. Regardless I was in the mood for pepper steak. Mother Nature would make the decision for me when it started to downpour in the northwest valley. Now I had decided on giving Dragon Wok a try. 

   When I made my way inside, it was a few minutes after it opened around 11 A.M. The only people that were inside the small take-out style restaurant were the two that worked there. I exchanged around $8 and change for the pepper steak lunch combination that included egg drop soup and fried rice plus a fountain Coke. 

   The diminutive restaurant featured only a few tables with little to look at. However, it did have a prime view of the kitchen. From this prime view, the customers have the advantage of watching the Chef make their Chinese food. 

  As far as my food went, the Chef did a fantastic job. The pepper steak and onions were delicious. The Chef made the pepper steak and onions the way I like it.  The pepper steak was soft, flavorful, and juicy. This pepper steak was the antithesis of the rubbery stuff that some Chinese restaurants pass off as pepper steak. The sauce and onions were equally flavorful. The fried rice was outstanding. Additionally the bowl of egg drop soup was good.

   The service was satisfactory. Because I was the sole customer in the restaurant it is difficult to tell how the service is when it is busy. The man who took my order then served the food, which is in a styrofoam plate by the way, did ask how my food was. The one drawback in service was that after the man brought the pepper steak lunch to my table, I had to ask him for the egg drop soup that is included. 

   My Dragon Wok dining experience was one of those times that I was glad to have a down pour lead me inside. Mother Nature created a down pour  that led me to a Chinese take out restaurant that served me one of the better pepper steak lunches and fried rice that I have had in a while.",2016-07-09 04:35:22

I actually did lease my 2008 Volkswagen Jetta from this dealership in 2008 and have taken my car here for all of its service appointments.  I did purchase a service contract which was great to have for the first 3+ years but now that it has run out I was worried about how much I would have to pay for service visits.  Thus far I am very pleased with Camelback VW... just recently I had to have my car towed there because it started overheating all the sudden.  When I called to make a appointment I was planning on using AAA to tow it but my service adviser said that I still qualify for VW roadside assistance and had someone out to my work within the hour to pick up my car.  The next morning I called to check on my car and it was already fixed under warranty.  It was a worry free experience for me and I greatly appreciate it.  Since my service contract ran out I have taken it there previous to this visit for a 45,000 mile service and they fixed my daytime running lamp, oil change + tire rotation for free because they wanted to be as close to the estimate that they stated on the phone.  I really appreciate that also.  It seems over the last couple years they have really focused on customer satisfaction... every time I go there they ask me to fill out the survey that is emailed to me because they are looking for a perfect score and they want to ensure they get that from you.

let's start with the upstairs: basically if you want to drink, they have it. i have found random and unknown beers here at reasonable prices. their wine selection is ginormous but the staff has created personal reviews that they display which really does help. normally i go by which bottle has the prettiest label but that doesn't always result in success. they also have over 100 different kegs available at prices lower than bevmo. people that work here are really friendly and knowledgeable and provide great recommendations on stuff to try.

downstairs: its like rolling into your friends living room and having a drink. i have missed my local bar ever since i moved to arizona and had really never been able to find a place like it until i walked downstairs. its kind of a two parter.. theres the main area when you first walk down. it also serves as a wine cellar. there's a larger room off to the side where you can listen to live music and have a little more space to stretch out. i prefer the cellar area since its close to the bar and i like staring at a ton of wine in one place. you can order anything thats on tap or walk up stairs and grab something out of the freezers (like you're at a friends place...except you have to pay) and bring it back down. normally there is only one guy on duty so you have to be patient when it comes to ordering from the bar or getting your tab but they are so damn friendly that it doesn't bother you.

The Armadillo Grill is misleading. From the outside, it isn't what you would expect. It's a sports bar with class and the food is awesome. My favorite? The fried pickles...such a guilty pleasure but I eat them with ease. The wings are also fantastic and so's the calamari.

The wait-staff are all friendly...every single person I've been served by has been attentive, friendly without being over bearing and sometimes, a big ol' smart ass (specifically Jason the bartender) which is right up my alley.

They have a great M-F happy hour of half price glasses of wine, which we partook in, and some of our table did actually get a pizza. The pizza looked fine. The caesar salad was actually great. The entree salmon was good, but undercooked for me (they didn't ask how we wanted it cooked, and it came out QUITE gelatinous in the middle - like think unset jello), and the asparagus that came with the salmon was just insufficient in volume. A mostly empty plate with ill-cooked fish is never going to be worth more than $5, and this was priced substantially above that. 

The dining area was nice, and the appeared to have an outdoor patio in front with heat lamps for cool and dry days. No complaints about service.

My husband and I made the mature decision to eat dessert before dinner because I wanted to try Vivido, and this was a wise decision. You want to have as much room as possible in your stomach for their delicious, creamy gelato. 

They easily have 40 flavors to choose from, possibly more, and the options are not strawberry and vanilla. No, they are mojito sorbet, pistachio caramel, molten chocolate cake, German chocolate cake, Turkish coffee... you get the picture? And, they are 110% committed to the flavor, so when you get the pistachio, it's not some flavoring added to the batter. No, it's whole pistachios right there in your ice cream cone. Entire walnut halves. Real fruit. Chopped up cakes. The ingredients are borderline insane. We spent a good 15 minutes staring at the ice cream counter with our mouths agape. The vats of ice cream were beautiful. We probably slobbered on the windows.

We didn't even blink at the prices, but the real deal here is a pint for a bit over $9. (Or a quart for more) You can get three different flavors, and the pint is cheaper than a couple of medium cones. Then, you can take your gelato home and giggle out loud in excitement.

I came here for lunch one day because Shanghai Cowgirl had a 45 minute wait, and I'm so glad I did. I'm quite fond of these grilled cornmeal sandwiches for its dense, crumbly texture. 

My boyfriend ordered arepa of the day- ham and cheese, which came stuffed with an incredible amount of shredded cheddar. I would prefer all of the cheese to be melted, but the combination was delicious nevertheless. 

I went for la llanera with beef tenderloin, avocado, fresco cheese and tomato. The meat was nicely charred and tender, and I loved the combination of the creamy avocado and fresco cheese. I wished that the filling was distributed more evenly within the sandwich. By the time I got to the bottom, all the avocado and beef were gone, and I was left with only cheese and sauce (which was still delicious). 

The arepas come with three types of sauce: garlic mayo, green pepper sauce and hot sauce. The hot sauce, however, was spectacularly spicy! I'm normally quite tolerant with spicy food, after a few generous squeeze, I was in tears! Now that is what I call spicy! That said, it was really tasty, but next time I'll be more light handed with the hot sauce. My boyfriend particularly favoured the garlic mayo and he slathered it all over the sandwich between his bites. 

Of course, we had to finish the meal with my favourite Dulce de Leche cheesecake. I'm officially proclaiming this cheesecake as my favourite in the city! It's just so good! Even my boyfriend, normally a cheesecake hater, really enjoyed the cake. It was delectable!

In addition, I also sampled the pumpkin cheesecake and alfajor cookie. I was actually disappointed with the alfajor cookie, as it had too much icing sugar on it. It was not nearly as delicious as the one I had from Aroma Espresso Bar. The pumpkin cheesecake was also delicious, but for $5, the portion seemed a little small. 

All in all, I really love this place- the vibe, the people, the food. If I lived near Arepa Caf√©, I'd be coming here at least once a week!",2011-11-07 03:41:57

If you can't find a seat, don't worry it's not you, it's them, this place has been popping off ever since the platinum blonde mayor of ""Flavortown"" set foot in here. 

The waiting isn't so bad, especially when you can enjoy a Bloody Mary or beer from the bar and after a few sips you'll hear your name being called over the PA and soon you'll be elbow deep in greasy spoon heaven.

This beast of a burrito comes packed with Italian Sausage, Eggs, Onions, Olives, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Tomatoes, Potatoes, and cheeesse! Holy gut bomb!

If you're asking if it was good... Duh. This is just what my tummy ordered, I'm sure any good doctor wouldn't recommend this meal, but whatever, you only live once or for the next six months if you continue to eat like this. The burrito surprisingly held together even though all this goodness was about ready to explode, salty, crunchy, and spicy it was all here. 

To make matters even tastier, I split a side of biscuits and gravy (Fuck, what's wrong with me?) this was also great; creamy gravy and a dense biscuit, count me in!

And while your taste buds won't be left bored, I can't exactly promise Tranquilo will hit the spot. 

I was excited to give this place a try, especially after giving them a few weeks to work through any inconsistencies. I decided to go with something modest and simple. Here goes: 

Carne asada burrito: The gold standard of casual Mexican fare. The meat used was clearly of above-average quality, but the choice in seasoning was conspicuously sweet. Almost like some sort of BBQ sauce. That would totally kick ass in taco form, but IDK about how it meshed with very strong, tangy cotija, and some of the saltiest pico I've ever had. No really, that salsa needs to be toned down. I am surprised at how poorly it was executed considering your other salsas (one's avocado, the other is...chipotle?) are absolutely legit. BTW, please make an effort to warm up your tortillas. Another BTW, this dish is a healthy portion size, meaning the average American should be prepared for something a bit small. 

Jicama cucumber slaw: This is more of a palate cleanser than a side dish. Looked cool, sounds cool, but IDK what they wanna do with this. It's just a crunchy, slightly sweet, forgettable little bowl of nothingness. Boring. 

Margarita: Damn good for $6. 10/10 would drink again.

Service is also pleasant (bravo for fixing this, Clarendon) and swift. I think this place has potential, and that way too many people are trashing it on Yelp because they can't stop crying about its predecessor taking off. But while diners who miss their old haunt aren't quite ready to put away the tissue, this is at the very least worth a try, so that they may fine-tune the flavors of affordable, quality food to become a worthy CenPho competitor.",2015-04-05 05:41:47

There are plusses to this place. We were on the guest list and yes even guys got in for free before 10:30. At this point there was no wait to get in. I also appreciated the signs out front that tell you where to go for what line. Girls also got a wristband for open bar until 11. Open bar meant well drinks, but they used 10 Cane for their well rum. Wow. Love 10 Cane. There was never more than a minute wait at the bar. I went to the one near the hallway to the restrooms and all three bartenders there were very nice.

Even the security guys were nice! Many of them even chatty! Lots of reviewers said the bouncers were all very rude but I guess since we were there early they didn't get in a sour mood yet being around a bunch of obnoxious drunk people. I know I'd get annoyed too.

Now the minuses. The dance floor is ridiculously small. We didn't even attempt to dance. The outside area is large, but the pool is laughable. I can't imagine there being a dayclub at that tiny thing. Is the real pool hidden somewhere?

For the rest of the evening, Adam showed himself to be helpful and a little playful with a good sense of humor.

Drinks: interesting Greek mythology-themed drinks, and the drink I ordered was pretty good.  They are a tad pricey, however.  Good microbrew beers on draft (except for the quickly getting old PBR), and my wife enjoyed a couple glasses of the Spanish cava.

Food: I would give it six stars if possible.  We ordered three apps to share amongst our table.

Unfortunately I was not impressed with the service or the food. I went around 2:00pm a little after lunch time and there were about 4 other families there. We were seated fast and were given water and the other drinks we ordered. It started off great. We then ordered our food and I got a cheese quesadilla with the new Mexican rice and the refried beans (mashed pinto beans as they called it). 

The quesadilla was good, but it's pretty hard to mess up. the rice tasted like it was from a microwaveable bag but with a lot of extra seasoning. The beans tasted like they were from a can and were left out, because they had a crusty edge around them. They topped off the beans with a soiled piece of lettuce. I was pretty disappointed because I've heard and read great reviews. I wondered if it would have tasted better after their normal daily dinner rush. 

After sitting for awhile we starred out the window waiting for our server to stop talking with her coworkers. We were also mesmerized by the employee sweeping close to customers feet and under their tables while they were eating. This was pretty funny to me and I shook my head in amazement. 

Overall the meal wasn't great and I could have saved 20 dollars going to another restaurant. Hopefully others have better service and food.",2017-10-29 23:57:27

For my first visit, I ordered one of the udons (forgot the name), a takosen, and my bf got the unatama don. I agree with other reviewers who say that the udon soup base lacks flavour and that the takoyaki (which is in the takosen) could be better, but keep in mind that both items are around the $5 mark, and for restaurants that deliver better quality on these items, they also charge a few dollars more. The more expensive item, unatama don, was delicious though, and I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dons, as well as their other snack items that aren't too common around Toronto. Overall, no Manpuku does not deliver Guu quality food, but it does provide decent and interesting items at a very affordable price. So all things considered, I think this is an excellent Japanese fast food place, and I envy the OCAD students who can come here on a daily basis!

It's not the best or most exciting I've ever had, and seems a little bland, but it's all right and good to have the option of Middle Eastern food close by.  I generally get carry-out when I am in town.  I like their appetizers best as they offer a variety of the things you'd expect like hummus, tabouleh, baba ghanoush, stuffed grape leaves etc. However, many of these items require pita bread to eat properly, and I can tell you when you get carry out they do NOT give you anywhere near enough pita bread, especially if you get the app sampler that has several.  I literally had to go out and buy more pita at the store to finish the leftovers the next day. It's disappointing especially given that this place is not cheap (a carryout app, entree and small dessert for 1 person costs me over 20 dollars).

Entrees are heavy on the ""rolled pita"" versions or the ""pitza"" versions of standard fare.  Since I'm not a member of the generation that wants everything served in pizza or burrito form, a little of that goes a long way.  The rolled pitas leak sauce like mad, so you have to use a fork anyway as if you try to eat it burrito style you will end up wearing half of it even if you are holding it in a wrapper. They do have some traditional style stuff served over rice and vermicelli but I'd prefer more of those selections and fewer of the rolls/ pitzas. As for dessert, they have good baklava but  most of the other options are Western desserts like cookies.  This makes me sad since I love me some Middle Eastern desserts and don't really need or want another place to get a brownie.  

Overall, it's okay for a quick baba and baklava fix, but not a five star experience for me.",2016-07-28 13:57:40

First of all the restaurant is located on the second floor and thankfully there are stairs as well as an elevator for greater accessibility. The restaurant also has communal seating at sleek metal tables, so if you don't like eating shoulder to shoulder with strangers, this may not be the place for you. They have  gender indifferent single stall washrooms. 

I like that they still offer decent fast casual food at affordable prices. I went with my go to basil beef and hubby ordered the golden curry chicken. There was a generous amount of meat in each of our dishes. I appreciate that you can customize the level of spiciness, where one chili is mild. Rice portions are generous too.

If in the area of Yonge and Dundas, it is worth checking out Salad King. It can get quite busy, so allot extra time if you're heading to the theatre nearby.

I've been here twice and the first time would have been 1 star that I forgot to review.  That being said, this second time was a great experience that deserves 5 stars.  I'd like to go one more time and decide for sure where this place sits.

Keep in mind that I'd jump to give the latest score to Red Square if it wasn't for the fact the 5 star experience came during a Private Event that was closed to the public.

Food was being served in appetizers and a buffet, The bar was open tab, The vodka vault was free to enter and a caviar station was setup.  It was a great experience that was run very well.

Not sure if it fully makes up for the awful dinner service I received a year prior.  Like I said, I'd try it one more time to make up my mind about this place.



PS:  Just an FYI to anyone looking to come here for the Vodka Vault.  Please please please do not pay $100+ for this ""privilege"".  I attended this party because of the coveted vault, and when I got in there...I was shocked.  It was basically a smaller cooler the size of an apartment closet.

Food is great too. I highly recommend their sliders. The brats are good as well, but I am not a brat connoisseur, so they all kind of taste the same to me (still good though). However, they put them on a great crusty roll and are accompanied by a selection of awesome, high-quality mustards. You get to select one topping to go on your brat as well, and I love the apricot chutney, if you are into the sweeter side of things. 

Also, been meaning to try this: they have a menu item I believe is called ""The Whole Hog."" Anywho, the idea is to get 20-ish of your closest friends together and order this item, as it is feeds large groups.

The sister restaurant to AZ 88 is chic and totally has a Manhattan vibe, with its minimalist, modern decor and live music.

The spot is comprised of several stories, with the main restaurant and bar on the middle floors. 

I had a Pimm's Cup, one of the bar's specialties, and a mojito.

The drinks are smaller portions than you might be used to, but that's how Hanny's does all their cocktails.

We shared a Bar Plate ($8.50), which is great if you love prosciutto, since there's a ton of it. It also comes with bread, cheese, olives and nuts-perfect to pair cocktails with.

My side salad ($4.50) was OK, but I wish the place served ranch dressing. I wasn't super-crazy about the Dijon vinaigrette.

And despite how much I love the cool vibe of Hanny's, the regular menu is so disappointing. If you don't like sandwiches, you're stuck with a salad or flat bread pizza. We ordered one with olives  ($12), and while I loved the cheese, it tasted more like a cracker than pizza.

The pizzas are just mediocre-I could make a better one myself, and I don't even cook. I would love if Hannny's expanded its menu or made thick-crust pizzas. Maybe if it had more to offer food-wise, the restaurant would become more popular.

I purchased a leather sectional and a matching fabric chair on 6/12. When they delivered the sectional a week later it arrived with damage to the leather and when they  tried to put the sections together it would not fit together. They ordered a new piece for the damaged section and said they would send service to fix the part that didn't fit.  The chair was back ordered. A couple weeks later they delivered the replacement for the damaged section but did not send  a service person to fix the part that does not fit even though they promised to send someone. I went back and forth on the phone trying to schedule service and delivery around my work schedule.  Apparently when they deliver furniture with problems you just get in line like everyone else and wait and take time off from work in block or 3-4 hours and wait for them to show up.  Finally I went to the store and spoke with the manager.  He said he would take care of everything and send my chair and a service person on 7/16 at 5:30.  At around 6 pm the delivery driver showed up with my chair but there were no legs on it! He said there was nothing he could do. huh? AND they again did not send a service person.  I called and left a message for the store manager and he called me back the next morning to say he would be at my house with a service person and a new chair on 7/19.  He did arrive with the chair and the service person but they could not fix my sectional and had to order a new one which should arrive next week.  I will agree RC Willey has great furniture but falls down in the service and delivery dept. If you have patience go for it. I have more furniture to buy but I will look at other options before buying again.  BTW my salesperson Steve was great.  RC Willey I hope you get better. Sad part is here it is over a month after purchase and I still don't have what I bought.

The Red Rock parking lot was packed but here we were only one of two tables, which should have been enough of a clue. Frankly, I should have just stuck with the original visit. Went in with a few coworkers and no one was impressed. 

Food was just lackluster. HH tacos are $3, with a few additional options for $4. They're small and for the most part, bland. The much-hyped carnitas were missing any sort of wow factor, while the swordfish contained a decent portion but no discernible seasonings. The nachos ($7, + $3.5 to add shrimp) were covered in various sauces but had no spice whatsoever, and the shrimp were small and cold. Plantains were just fine, but heads up that gluten-free folks should steer clear of the dipping sauce.

Service was embarrassingly slow. I don't know if our server was new (didn't seem to be) or just generally scatterbrained, but she seemed to frequently forget that she had a table. We had to ask a busser to let her know we were ready to order, then when we had a question about whether a dish contained gluten, she disappeared for 15 minutes. We actually got an answer from another employee before she came back (and still didn't have an answer). I don't mind how the dishes come out as they're ready, but when three people order several tacos that aren't separated into individual plates or orders, it gets unnecessarily complicated for both the food runners (who are clueless as to who ordered what) and the diners (who then have to touch one another's finger-food).",2015-09-27 12:26:13

I do live on the south side so it was journey traveling all the way here just to grab a bite for lunch. I've passed Rampart Commons numerous times, but never actually shopped at any of the stores. I immediately notice that more than half the cars are luxury cars with range rovers appearing the most, welcome to Summerlin I guess? 

Anyway so Honey Salt is tucked in the corner, a larger sign would probably help them to be more noticeable not that they don't already have good marketing tactics. Apon walking inside from what I remember the walls are mainly composed of bricks. The restaurant is definitely trying to give off that farm vibe, but definitely modern and classy at the same time. A chandelier in a farm though? Haha, I guess that was an accent piece.  I already knew I was going to order the chicken sandwich because of what Misti and Anthony had said in their reviews. Chick Fil A on crack ay? Prior to our food arriving we received our bread and these crispy things almost like pita chips but much thinner. The bread was very similar or even identical to what Filipinos call ""pan de sal,"" but this was a wheat version. Nothing special but the cripy things were rather good and fun to dip with into the white bean dip puree according to my friend? Our food came out pretty quick maybe 15 minutes or so? My friend raved about how good the kale salad was the last time she was here to the point she even dreamt about it. Thankfully the chicken sandwich came with a salad that had kale in it and I was looking forward to it since I've never had kale before. The chicken sandwich was rather stuffed, but that's what I expect when paying $13. The breading on the chicken was pretty good, the honey mustard was probably my favorite part. Usually there isn't enough sauce on sandwiches, but this was the prefect amount. Nice slaw inside the sandwich as well. Overall it was good, but I don't know if it's something to do back flips over if you know what I mean? The side salad was mainly composed of edamame, a little bit of kale, a lot of these seeds (I don't know what kind it was), but which was good. Maybe some type of vinaigrette would have been nice? My friend ordered the meatballs and offered me a bite and that was okay too. Our server Julie was pretty good except I felt like at one point we kind of lost her. The service was definitely better than what I expected based on the early reviews of when they first started. Lastly we ordered the chocolate cake for dessert! OMG soo good probably one of the best pieces of cake I've ever had. 3 layer cake with banana cake in the middle. I thought that was a really nice so it wouldn't be too overwhelming with the chocolate. The frosting outside the cake was light fluffy and not too overly sweet.

We were cutting it pretty close to having to be at the airport, but had roughly an hour so the 20 minute wait didn't scare us off.

We sat at the bar and each enjoyed a couple of frozen, blended, strawberry drinks (about $12 each) and lots of conversation with the bartenders and waitresses picking up drinks, before our name was called and we were seated. A coffee ($4) was brought quickly and orders were taken fast too. Everything was off to a great start! 

My boyfriend ordered an omelette and hashbrowns for brunch. I ordered 3 eggs over-medium ($4), a bowl of country gravy, and a side of onion rings to dip in the gravy and egg yolk. I know, I know...  kinda weird but the rings on the table next too us looked too good to miss. Food finally came out (HUGE omelette and plate of hash $14!!) - everything arrived but the onion rings - which we were told would be there soon. So I ate my eggs. And then a bowl of gravy with a spoon. As I finished the last bite, we received another apology from Sophia for the untimeliness (still no rings) so at this point, since we'd finished eating, I begrudgingly had her cancel the order.  No offer to bring them out in a to-go box or anything...! Shouldn't they be almost done? I was really disappointed they messed up my breakfast order and did nothing to fix it. I had nothing to dip in my eggs or gravy, yet was still charged for the $3 side, which I ended up having to eat by eatself! No offer for toast.... anything?! Luckily, the airport was close so we had more food and drinks there while waiting for our delayed flight.

I totally understand when something goes wrong in a kitchen, or there's a miscommunication with staff, but in most instances, the best thing to do is not make the customer suffer as a result. If they cooked the onion rings anyway, all I can imagine is maybe they'd rather keep them for themselves than give them up for free to a hungry customer - from the way they looked on the table next to us, that's probably what happened.

Top Must-Get: lamb - topping
Top Regret: mango milkshake/side apps
What I'll Try Next: one of the rice combos

I came here on a Sunday afternoon at 3 pm for a late lunch. It wasn't‚Äã that busy (about a third full), and it's got more of a homely vibe (might be the potted plants they line up the shelves with).

To order, we grabbed an order sheet and just checked off the soup base, toppings, type of noodle, side order, and drink that we wanted.
They too, are missing the super wide and flat rice noodles... Alas, the journey continues. They also come with more ""base toppings"" than I'm used to (parsley, mushrooms and cabbage all come with your noodles unless you check off that you don't want it).

Anyway, their selection seems similar to competitors, but Lucky Noodle might have fewer drinks. However, while Lucky may have fewer options, they definitely come with bigger portions! 

FOOD
I got lamb and bakchoy as my toppings ($1.50 for extra toppings after two). The lamb felt a bit chewy and overcooked but it was decent. The bakchoy was standard.

The defining part of a noodle place is the soup base. One unique part about Lucky is the thick pork soup base at the same price point, which I don't think competitors offer. However, I didn't love it and will probably stick with chicken next time!

Big quantities is the name of the game here. Quality is decent. EXCEPT...

The appetizers. These are definitely smaller in size than other places, and took me about three gulps to down (to be fair, I was hungry, and most noodle-spot apps only take me five gulps to down anyway... But that's still a significant difference!)

SERVICE
Service was okay. Definitely not the most attentive servers as we had to flag them down a couple times, and they mistakenly gave us someone else's order of luncheon meat... But hey, the food came quick and they were patient with us.

All in all, it's my current preferred spot for customized noodles!",2017-04-02 00:00:27

I was brought a menu immediately and ordered a lunch special (Garlic Chicken) with a spicy level of 7.  I noticed a buffet type food cart and asked what it was and without answering she motioned for me to the cart.  There were spring rolls and soup that you could help yourself to.

So I didn't end up giving them to her.  I took my clumpy mess home instead for me to eat.  I'm taking off one star for having so much frosting they aren't really good to transport.

I'm taking another star off because when I went to eat them, although the cake itself is some of the moist and best I've ever had, there was just too much frosting and I had to throw some of it away (and I hate to do that, dammit).  

I had the Midnight Magic, the Texas Milk Chocolate, the Key Lime, and another that I can't remember, but it was chocolate with white frosting.

When I went on a Tuesday night there were only about 2 other tables being used, so it was very quiet, which was great. Our waiter was excellent, he did a fantastic job describing each dish and making sure we always had drinks in our glasses and got us anything we needed. 

I believe the menu changes often and they offer a $50 3 course meal which consists of a starter, a soup or salad and an entree. When I was there in the middle of March I was able to try many things and a couple of my favorites were the gnocchi, the prime ribeye and the pate, which was a $5 extra. 

My only issue with this restaurant is it is a B.Y.O.B. and they charge a 10 dollar corking fee. Usually that wouldn't bother me, but if you are buying the alcohol from their wine store that is connected to the dining room then they should not charge that corking fee in my opinion.

To begin we ordered the stuffed dates, some of the lightly breaded calamari, pan y manchego cheese, paella and I believe braised mussels. Definitely one of the best food experiences I've had since moving here. Paella was delicious. It came out hot, with a lobster claw and a ginormous prawn for the ""Mixed Paella"" that was nice and tender. Service was on point -- filling our water when needed, divvying our paella, providing us with some bread when we needed to sop up some mussel juice even. Service wasn't too obtrusive and dispite being a little secluded in the back corner (it was by choice as I wanted for me and the date to have a little privacy) came by frequently enough to check up on us when needed. 

Oh and all that seafood paired with the light, crisp white wine sangria just made my mouth melt. I wanted a pitcher. But watch out tho' folks, just like any well prepared, crazy yummy, addictive sangria, this one is a creeper drink. Talk about the perfect libation to cool off that stifling Los Wages heat.

One *very* minor knock though is the restaurant's casual ambiance.

However, it took forever to get attention from the waiter after he left the menus. The food didn't take long to come out after we ordered, so it wasn't the kitchen, it was solely the wait staff. 

I ordered a Caesar to start, a petit filet minion, with potatoes au gratin and asparagus as sides. Yes, I was starving. First bite into the salad and the only thing I tasted was salt. I had maybe 4 bites and put it to the side. My perfectly cooked meat was inedible with how much salt was added on. I was so saddened by this. As you might guess, this was the same story with both of the side dishes. 

The cocktails weren't anything to get excited over, and the glass my champagne came in was sticky. Gross.

While of course recognizing the differences in fundraising and available resources in the animal shelter world, Campus for Compassion should still be recognized as a clean and hospitable place for homeless pets where the staff is super-friendly and genuinely cares. In other words, while some shelters, especially city or county-run ones, can't necessarily be blamed for the poor conditions their animals are housed in, it is still refreshing to see a non-profit organization that's making every effort to provide a shelter that's on a whole other level. This place is literally a few blocks from our house, and since the moment we moved in, we have literally been there two times a week to check out all of the new kittens (it's full-on kitten season right now!). Last Friday afternoon, we finally succumbed and adopted two beautiful little tabby brothers. (We already have two cats, so we knew that we were in for a crazy month or two!). The adoption counselors were patient and kind and treated us with respect both when we played with the kittens in the ""get acquainted"" rooms and when we sat down to fill out our paperwork. Do be forewarned that they take a long time to fill out all of the adoption paperwork and get the process finalized, so don't expect to just be in and out. If you want to adopt a homeless pet from a great organization run by great people, definitely stop by here!

I ended up finding it and when I pulled up the owner and another female employee were sitting outside smoking a cigarette. Upon entering the employee asked us what samples we wanted before washing her hands. My friend and I asked if she would please wash her hands before serving us and from this point forward she was cold towards us. 

After sampling two flavors the lady said only two samples per person because this is the policy of the owner. This is not only tacky but it shows no level of customer service. As a business owner if you are passionate about your product you should willing to give out samples because you will be rewarded with loyal customers. 

I ended up ordering a medium half strawberry cheesecake and half cookie dough. My friend ordered a small molten chocolate cake. The female employee preparing my order packaged the gelato in a sloppy way so when she put the lid on the gelato was dripping off the side. She also put ice straight into the bag which caused it to leak in my car. 

When I got home I looked into the bag and the gelato was all over the bag mixed with the ice. The employee did not put the lids on properly. I could not eat the gelato so I called back for a refund. The female owner had a hard time understanding me and said to talk to her husband. Even though I live far I was forced to drive all the way back. Once there, the male owner was very argumentative with me and said this happens sometimes. When I asked for a refund he just stared at me with a bewildered look.

It has adorable decor and I've been told they really upgraded the space.  It had a wonderfully modern and current feel to it, with colorful photos of italy and succulents abound.  

The food was actually quite good, it just wasn't great.  

We started off with bread and a quite nice but garlicy dipping sauce.  They were a little light on the bread and we actually had to ask for it to be refilled at least two other times.  We're not big bread people, but a tiny slice per person just looks skimpy.  

We ordered the the Meatball starter, Mac-and-Cheese, Ravioli, Lasagna and Gnocchi.  Specifically the Lasagna was huge, but though it was filled with everything in the book (including tiny formed meatballs - strange?), it just seemed to be lacking in flavor.  The Gnocchi was good but chewy.  I'm not sure if they'd been frozen or vacuum packed, but they weren't the light fluffy gnocchi that I look for.  

Lastly we ordered a cannoli.  Again, the stuffing was a bit dense and had less of a ricotta taste than I'd prefer (it was almost like an icing?)

The fruitiest, most raspberry-filled and most delicious summer beer in the existence and history of all of mankind. That's right folks, the most scrumptious beer ever to be made can be found right here in our homeland on the lovely Ossington strip.

Bellwoods Brewery, it seems you are officially turning me into a beer girl.

The craft beers here are made in small batches and the menu is constantly changing and rotating, which means if you want the frambizzle you need to go now. I've had the most amazing fruity girly beers here, containing elements of peach, hibiscus, coconut and lime. But last night's brew was hands down my favourite.

Why 5 stars? Previously my relationship with BB existed on a patio basis, but last night as we waited in line a spot on the mezzanine became available. My beau and I took it, even though our hearts had been set on the patio, and I am so glad we did. From up there we could see the vats, the dining room, the patio, the bartenders as they poured pint after pint. I actually hadn't realized how much fits into this place before.

I've never even had the food here, side from some almonds drowning in honey and cayenne (YUM!), but there are a few menu items that look amazing. Perhaps I shouldn't go forward with the five, but I can't help it. I have such a nice time when I come here. This place just makes me really happy. 

The other great thing about Bellwoods is you can buy their beer. Forgetting the name of my fave drink, I hurriedly rushed to the retail side to buy my new bevvy. ""Tell me you have the razzmatazz!?"" I said, frantically. ""I believe you mean the Frambizzle,"" he said. Indeed I did! But alas, that's a new beer and it's not being bottled until this weekend. As fate may have it, it seems I will be back at BB within the next couple of days.",2013-06-28 14:39:35

This place is far from downtown, east of Queen St E and DV but easy to find parking. A small restaurant, sits at most 24 people in either 2-seats tables or one large 6-seats table. We saw a lot of people do take-out on a Sunday night, so definitely popular for the area. The open kitchen and dark and eclectic decor makes it seem like a young hip restaurant. 

We got greeted by a young eager guy who was able to describe the sizes of the pieces--which come in either small or large. We ended up ordering the small White Pie ($16) and small Sweet Corn Pie ($16). I was hoping for the Hawaiian but they seem to not have that tonight. 

I don't know whether or not it was because I was tired from work or we were both really hungry, but I felt our two small pizzas took way too long to arrive at our table. Maybe 20 minutes? I was going to give this place the benefit of the doubt but in my opinion, pizza shouldn't take that long to cook, especially in an extremely hot pizza oven, which averages 450-500 deg F, but the customers beside us that arrived after we finished our pizzas seemed to get their pizzas in under 10 min. Maybe they were busy with take-out orders? 

The pies were definitely tasty and flavourful but not the best ones I've had due to a few flaws.  The crust is for sure original--thick and super crispy with cheese. The inner part of the pie was very doughy and some may even say undercooked but I actually like doughy pies so not a problem for me. The Sweet Corn Pie had corn beschamel sauce, loads of cheese, smoked bacon and some sweet chilis on top. Overall a good flavour combination but I was expecting an intense sweet corn flavour, especially from the beschamel. Most of what I could taste is cream and cheese (from the beschamel), and little bits of corn and chilis every other bite. I'd suggest to the chefs to try and get more corn flavour in there. I mean if you are advertising Corn, I'd better be getting lots of corn flavour! 

I liked the White Pie better. Loads of mozzarella  and ricotta cheese, well done carmelized onions and arugula on top. This is the first pie I thought that was too much stringy cheese but with the sweet carmelized onions and the bitter sharp argula on top, I liked this balance in flavours. But again, the inside part of the pie dough was undercooked. The crust was done the same, crispy, cheesy and very greasy.  

They offered us a free Italian chocolate pudding. Super sweet, creamy, rich chocolate with salt on top. The salt really made it. A very nice dessert. 

One annoyance I have to mention. I noticed other tables were getting a bottle of some hot sauce. When I asked a server about it, he said it was their signature honey hot sauce. So I asked if I could try it. He squeezed some into a small container instead of bringing the entire bottle.  I didn't say anything because he brought it as we were finishing our last two pieces of pie but how rude, can't even bother bringing us the entire bottle. What, you think I'm going to eat it all or steal it home? This left a bitter taste in my mouth in terms of their service. Both servers try hard to be nice but I felt service was lacking and did not match up to the food. Perhaps I'll just get take out next time and not leave tip for dine-in.",2015-09-28 12:46:43

I should mention that my reviews for Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi are identical, as, after many visits to each, I find they are beans from the same edamame pod.

There's much to say about Sushi. It's raw fish on rice, and it must be prepared by hand and with care. That helps justify the expense, even though it's customary in our society to equate ""value"" with ""man, I'm full.""

Which is why places like Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi continue to be overflowing success stories. They provide the same ample feeling you might expect for $15 at any bistro, pub, or family restaurant, but, under the cover of ""sushi"" the average consumer feels that they had a healthy meal, or that they've experienced something avant garde.

The sushi at this restaurant barely has any taste, except for a hint of the saran wrap it sits in before a chef slaps it on some rice, and/or in a box, and on your table. Let's be frank: most Bloor Street consumers drench the rice in soy sauce and wasabe paste anyway.

The fish here is barely distinguishable. They make some extremely tasty special rolls ($10) but these tend to use cream cheese, avocado, tempura, or other filler that, again, makes the fish indistinguishable.

So it's hard to rate this place other than to say: expect a wait, you won't pay too much if you order smartly, and you'll probably get tea at the beginning and ice cream at the end.

Matcha mochi was inside the waffle and gave the waffle a chewy texture. Portion wise is quite large and needs to be shared since it's a heavier dish with the mochi.

The biggest disappointment is the matcha molten cheese tart. This dish comes with 2 tarts. It was not molten at all, and on top of that it was burnt. Flavour wise it's like a cheesecake in a tart shell. Matcha flavour wasn't really there and it was filled with red bean. Hopefully other customers had better luck with this dish than I did.

A favourite Ramen place! Both the sake and the ramen were delicious!

It's a small space and busy during lunch. We came in on a Friday at 11:30 AM and luckily, we managed to grab a 4 person table before the noon rush.

I ordered a Tako Yaki to start, followed by Vegetarian Shoyu Ramen. Both were really great (and filling)! It was lots of fun to order the special sake shot, so much energy and cheers from staff!

It's HUGE, though, so be sure you know what hall your trade show/convention is in before you park!  Unless it's CES, of course, since that takes up the whole thing!  I've been coming here for years and have attended many shows, Amusement Expo (in all its incarnations), CES, Pizza Expo, Bar & NIghtclub Expo, etc...  Yeah, I'm a weird trade show junkie.

I usually park across the street and walk across the skybridge to get inside.  That lot is usually $10, but for CES, it might be more - because we all get ripped off when CES is rolling.   We used to park on Debbie Reynolds for free, but I get lazier as I get older.  You can also park over at LVH for free.  

Okay, enough about parking.  On the inside, it's really clean and nice.  Every show is a little different and the configuration always seems to change up.  It's awesome that they can actually do so many different configurations.  There are lots of bathrooms, and even a food court of sorts on the North end with snack bar and Starbucks.  For some reason that place can close early, like 3pm, though, so definitely check on that if you're counting on it for your food!  Right across from there is a Harley Davidson store.  I don't know why.  That is a strange one.  I like that since you're in Vegas, you can just bring your beer with you everywhere, too, so we run out to the car and grab some cold ones for walking around beers while we're enjoying a show!

Like someone else said here, if you take a taxi here, fuggedaboudit.. you will wait in a hellacious line to get out of there.

If you want to stay close to the convention center, there are plenty of  hotels around it... as mentioned the LVH is right next door, across the street you have several Marriott properties and there are some others in a short radius around the convention center.  The closest strip hotels are the Wynn/Encore and the Riviera.  They are walkable, but it's a longish walk!

We were initially seated at the bar to await our table for our reservation, and I can honestly say I wasn't really that impressed after sitting inside at the bar for the first 20 minutes. We ordered our drinks and waited for our table and from looking around at the bar, I noticed the inside wasn't that big, but it was crowded. There was a long table filled on one end of the floor, and the center of the floor was taken up by couch seating for lounging and also filled with parties of people. Everyone seemed pretty on top of each other, seeing as there wasn't much room to walk in between, but then we opted to sit outside (it was just opened up).

Outside was gorgeous. I could spend all day and night there. The ambiance was relaxing, cool and casual. Palm trees and spray misters surrounded the whole rooftop and it was so relaxing that I di not want to leave. Not to mention that since it was so hot out in the middle of July, no one opted to sit outside except for maybe two other couples that we shared the roof with. I'll say it again, gorgeous. 

Our dinners were divine. They have a strict Ocean-to-Table menu mindset. We were excited to get our seafood fix here for our vacation. I got something on special, a branzino with some arugula seafood salad. I hadn't had this type of fish yet and it was very flavorful. My boyfriend indulged in Sea Bass all week long and he took advantage of their specialty here. Fantastic and light. But surprisingly the star of the dinner would have to be those potatoes. Our waiter was very excited to pair our dinners with a side of these potatoes because he impressed upon us that they would pair very nicely with both of our choices of dinners..and oh it did. Those potatoes, there wasn't a spot left in that bowl of potatoes. And to be honest, I probably could have ate another bowl if they brought us another. That good.

If you enjoy naan I recommend getting the garlic for a little bit more flavor. I usually get chicken vindaloo because I love to eat spicy food, but I have had many of the other chicken dishes as well and have never left feeling disappointed.

Not only does this place have an incredible lunch deal (few entrees were over 8 bucks, they have a 10-item lunch buffet for $8 as well) it's possibly the best Italian in Charlotte.

Service was a little spotty but I'm going to go ahead and attribute that to the (literal) busload of retirees swarming the ""bottom"" floor. Our bread, once we got it, was easily on par with the rest of our meal, and served with really, really good pesto and olive oil. The special appetizer was amazing: pile of baby arugula, balsamic reduction, 20-25 shitake mushroom caps sizzled and grilled to almost crispy perfection. Dollops of goat cheese as a garnish. Wow.

House made Fazzoletti Della Nona was amazing. Reminded me of waaay back in the day when I used to eat seafood - the texture was almost that of squid (trust me, it was delicious), perfect folded al dente sheets, rosemary tinged broth, cannelinis abounding. The Insalate Bianca was flavorful without being overwhelmingly fennel-y. We were served a small mango-citrus sorbet between app and main, unexpectedly. Very nice touch.

I can't wait to try their pizzas. Even if they're crap, this is where I'll be whenever I'm craving pasta. The 2nd story nook, as inexplicable as it seems (what's under there? wine storage? mob kills? aaah) is super comfy and very low traffic. Might even be good date seating at night with lower light.

Portions are solid and prices fair, but there are a number of things Karey's could improve on. 

First, the signature dishes we tried didnt have much wow factor at all.   The cute little lumpia are like Sharon Stone in 'Basic Instinct'. Blonde and delicious on the outside, dark and horrible within. The pork paste, or whatever it is, might as well be dog food. Sorry, but that's my honest opinion.  The authentic, custardy cassava cake was different (yay!) and cheap(yay!), but quite mild for a dessert, at least to my undiscerning, sugar-addled taste.   

Our chicken sample was dry, the pork adobo and beef offered were better - the texture of the slow cooked beef reminded me of my mother's Yankee pot roast - only this had less flavor and seasoning.  My unadventerous teen said his beef burrito was one of the worst meals he's had in a while...not much juicy meat taste and a ridiculous amount of cheese which overpowered everything.  

Second, the free samples are fun and appreciated but the context in which they're provided is a little awkward.  When we walked in, all the steamtrays were covered and there were no pictures of the food - at least not that I remember. Maybe there's a culinary reason for the covers, but you cant SEE or really SMELL any food!  So you're kind of at Karen's ""mercy"" to provide you with these toothpick samples.  She cheerfully offered three mainstays (chicken, beef, pork)...and then there was this sort of lull, where I guess we were supposed to ""decide"", despite a blackboard off to the side, listing four or five addtl specialties.   

It's partly my fault. I asked about pancit and dropped a hint or two that I wanted to try a variety, but couldve been more forceful probing options.  By this time, however, we had already eaten six skewers and I felt a little piggish asking for more. And Karen didnt offer more. Were we hard sold something we didnt want? No.  But I felt gently steered toward a few standard selections and away from other (more exotic?) options, especially considering there was nobody behind us in line.  If the covers were off, or there were pictures, I'd have been more likely to say, ""That looks interesting"" or ""that smells good, what's that?"".   In lieu of a detailed, descriptive menu (there is none, although Karen was verbally descriptive and very helpful) I just think a customer benefits most from a visual display (think Miracle Mile Deli, Panda Express, etc) of ready to eat fare.     

We stopped by around 5:30pm on a Thursday, and were at Karey's around  fifteen minutes.  There were no other customers.  Zero.  Tons of traffic driving home from work. And nobody.   At this point, I think Karey's is a more sincere than genuinely  savvy operation, but that could change by smoothing a few rough edges,  showcasing all their recipes and maybe a spicier sauce or two.  

Two minor glitches.  We werent given a receipt copy for our take out order. Also, one of our plastic clamshells leaked on the way home.   The sauce was filled near the brim, but it was messy and annoying.  Good intentions...not so good execution.    

There's definitely potential here and they're not too far from making this a terrific place with broad appeal.  Who wouldnt root for a relatively unfamiliar cuisine served up by such friendly folks?   But I think (for well intentioned Yelpers) to pretend they've already nailed it, largely on the strength of warm greetings and surprisingly mild fare with exotic names, may be setting Karey's up for a wave of unmet expectations. I know that's how we felt.",2009-11-22 23:01:20

I was expecting there would be a wait, but luckily there seemed to be a few tables open. I went up to the hostess desk which is perched up above the rest of the restaurant. I asked for a table for 4 and she said that it was not a problem and turned away and stood at the top of the stairs. Confused, I asked if I just seat myself or what? As she played with her hair she turned around from leaning on the railing and said she was just waiting for tables to get cleaned. Then went back to chatting with another girl, playing with her hair and looking over the restaurant. 

We stood there for longer than I expected, but I get it, tables do need to get a wipe. Still she just stood there, and then after a bit decided to walk down into the restaurant. When she came back to address us she pointed out into the restaurant and told us that we could sit ""over there"". I had to ask 2 more times which table we were sitting at because she refused to walk us to the table. Once sitting, I noticed that she put together a table for 2. Yet, we were 4. Good job, Hostess. 

At this point I was pretty irritable and was ready to leave. Then our server walked over and it was as if sunshine and rainbows came out as she walked over. She immediately moved us to a more suitable table, wiped it down, got our drink orders, and cracked a few jokes. Unfortunately, because we had to move we got a new server who wasn't as enthusiastic and cheerful, but still pleasant. Anything was better than the Hostess.

The drinks were fantastic, the vibe was fun and laid back, and the food was good. I'll try Local Public Eatery again, but hopefully they can step up on their costumer service game when it comes to the Hostess.

This is probably an unfair review as the mall is currently undergoing a MAJOR reno!  Some stores are either closed, moved, & you hafta trek down a tunnel in order to get to Holts.

As it stands right now, this is sorta an embarrassment to the chain.  I even saw a brand that they were selling at a Winners, but for triple the price!?!)

Lotsa mothers with strollers as this mall is only 1-level, with the exception of the food court.  Layout of the mall is a figure-8.  At times, it can be a bit confusing finding a specific store if you're at the wrong end of the mall.

It was an impromptu decision to get lunch here, since I was originally planning to go get dim sum with some classmates afterclass. But being the first week of school, things were hectic and things rarely goes according to plan.

Anyway, I figure since I was in the area taking care of errands, I will drive a few more blocks to try another new item on the HK Star lunch special menu. I have typically ordered the more expensive items, so decided I want to try something from the $4.95 portion of the menu.  Hong Kong Style Chow Fun sounds interesting, and I have never ordered it and would like to find out what exactly is HK Style Chow Fun.

When the waiter came, that was what I told him I wanted ""Hong Kong Style Chow Fun"" (#8 on the $49.5 lunch special menu - okay I didn't say the #8 part of it).  He said theone with the gravy. I have never ordered it, so I said sure. He also wanted to confirm that I wanted Chow Fun, because on the menu the Chow Mein option is also available, and I said yes.  He looked a little confused to me, and I repeated the order again in Mandarin ""Hong Kong Style Chow Fun"" and off he went to punch in the order in the POS.

Minutes later, a generous plate of chow fun with gravy and vegetables, shrimp, chicken and fish arrived.  I was hungy for the past 2 hours so I took a quick picture and dug in.  The food was delicious, and I was thinking this is a great deal for $4.95. I ate the entire plate of chow fun without being interrupted by the wait staff.  It wasn't until the very end when I have ate everything that the waiter who took me to the table brought over the check.

When I saw the bill, I realized the fantastic deal was a mistake, because they have made me ""House Pan Nood, sub Chow Fun"", which I interpretted as House Pan Friend Noodles made with Chow Fun and asking me for $6.51 for my lunch. I was annoyed enough to write a comment on the bill that I ""asked for Hong Kong Style Chow Fun"" and left my $7 for lunch. I figured besides taking my order wrong and delivering the food and provided no additional service, such as asking if everything was okay or if I needed more tea or water, that was what was earned.

So downgrading my rating to 4 stars solely on the poor listening skill, not knowing the menu and non-existent service.  I feel had I called my order ahead and the regular waiter took my order, I would have been given what I ordered. Or my experience today at HKS was due to being stuck with the crappy waiter that some other Yelper have complained about.

The place is small but packed.  The inside reminded me of a tired coffee time type of joint where people were just milling about.  Difference was that they were being served HK style snacks and noodle soups.  

We went specifically for the tea so that's what we tried.  We got a cold HK style milk tea and a cold lemon tea with a pineapple bun.  I thought the milk tea was good but if you asked me what made this tea an award-winner in my books, I wouldn't be able to tell you.  It was good but not too different from other HK style milk teas I've had in the past.  Lemon tea was refreshing with the addition of real lemon juice.  

My toddler loved the pineapple bun so that's probably what we'll go back for next time.  As for the tea?  Sure, if I happen to be thirsty when I'm there.",2014-08-28 20:59:23

We were met by an ill-tempered bouncer at the door; poor service at the bar, and just a generally bad attitude. 

It was clear that they didn't want us there; which is astonishing, considering that our group is a friendly, good natured bunch, and tend to both spend and tip lavishly.

At one point - in an attempt to get a picture of the whole scene, I asked one of the bouncers if I could take a couple photos from the tiny little deck that serves as a ""stage"". He responded bruskly ""Make it quick"".  I smiled, and said ""Sure"". I got my camera out and took one photo, and he yells ""Okay, that's enough. get down"".

Huh???? WTF?
I was friendly. I asked politely. There was no one performing, or any equipment on the stage. I was there as a paying customer, and was trying to get a nice pic that I could post - which could have been a nice visual endorsement of the place.

But F that.

I was going between the lox and cream cheese bagel and the salmon omelet. I went with the salmon omelet because I really wanted to try a side of chocolate chip pancakes, since you're allowed to order a single. I wasn't really into the omelet though. I understand the smoked salmon is salty and adding in the capers made it extra salty, but it was just too much for me. The homefries were also disappointing and not crispy enough.

Nothing much has changed since my last review, but going again just confirmed that this place is the sh*t according to the locals. I say that because this place was so packed! By about 12:30pm all tables were full -- I need to say that again, ALL the tables were full. I mean, that's quite a thing to boast about in bf nowhere Newmarket. Okay, I take that back, Newmarket is much more happening than it was before.

I got the Pho dac biet and spring rolls which my usual go to Combo, which I do recommend as the bare-minimum standard issue food order for anyone going to any Pho. Again, I've had better spring rolls in that I'm spoiled and used to a different type of batter. But the spring roll itself was not bad. Tasted everything just like a spring roll should be (got the pork version btw) and was hot out of the fryer, wowee!

I reiterate that the Pho was legit. Good in my books.

This place is a single-man operation during lunch in weekdays, but this guy is a magician handles the floor pretty well and efficiently. That said, there's no time for small talk/connection/shootin' it with the waiter/busser/cashier cause this guy is trying to do three roles at once, nevertheless with calm and composure. Kudos to him, I would be ripping my hair out.

Would say again that service and decor could be a notch better. And if anyone from the store is reading this... do something about the dry limes! But all in all, this is a small mom/pop shop pho place has been just fine the way it is -- willing to look past some of the criticisms.

Born Marcus Sgrizzi, but known locally as Chef Marc, it was before officially relocating to Las Vegas that a visit to Parma acquainted me with the Chef's well-deserved acclaim, and subsequently meeting some now-close friends by way of an event held at Novecento it seemed strange that Trattoria by Chef Marc had slipped beneath my radar nearly nine months since opening, the move finding Mr. Sgrizzi now in a more refined space only ten minutes from my gate.

East Coast raised, but well traveled throughout Italy with an 'effort equals results' sort of mentality that sees Marc and his team scratch-make everything from Bread and Pasta to Desserts and Sauces in-house, Trattoria by Chef Marc sits just outside The Lakes on West Sahara Avenue in a space formerly inhabited by Argana Moroccan Restaurant, the interior featuring heavy woods and marble plus a hand-built Wine Vault with sound a bit louder than would be ideal due to the combination of hard surfaces and overhead music, though a near-full-house of locals still did not make things so noisy that one would be forced to shout.

Offering an a la carte menu plus a $65 ""Chef's Table"" that sees diners preferences incorporated into a tasting otherwise left in the kitchen's hands, it was by request that Marc and his team crafted an 'extended' version of the latter experience that eventually turned into eleven courses including several menu favorites, the quality of many comparing favorably to Casino-based restaurants charging more than twice the price.

Well established in the city, and as such forming relationships with high quality purveyors of Italian goods plus vegetables brought in from Melissa's Produce of California, a meal at Trattoria begins with Sgrizzi's bread basket and although little packets of cold butter seem a bit out of place in an environment where Olive Oil should come standard the Bread itself is as delicious as it is dangerous, both the Pizza Focaccia and warm Semolina loaf difficult to resist, particularly as a means for sopping up sauces.

No doubt looking to build on past successes and further strengthen a menu filled with the time-tested recipes on which he built his name, first courses of the Chef's Table saw Chef Marc dabbling in fresh ingredients that he has recently become fond of, the Sea Urchin seemingly served as a means to work with seasonal Fruits and Wasabi leaf while the inspired Salad that followed tasted very much like Fava Beans despite the fact that only Greens, Grapes, Cheese and Seasoning were mingling on the plate.

Turning eyes to the laminated menu for a moment, the Buratta Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes and aged Balsamic expected but delicious in its simplicity just the same, course four saw Chef Marc take on the hefty pairing of Pork Belly and Bone Marrow with a keen sense of delicacy, the supple pig stacked atop buttered toast while the hemisected Cannon saw its creamy contents delicious whether mixed into Polenta or enjoyed with Picked Fennel Bulb and traditional Parsley Salad.

Personally requesting the Eggplant Parm, a small wedge offered alongside house Marinara and lightly fried herbs, a nightly special Pasta next saw soft Meat and Ricotta spring to life in a butter sauce tinged in Nutmeg and Sage, the line-caught Halibut to follow both meaty and flaky beneath a skin of crisp Sesame Seeds with rich Scallop Bisque lent levity by Pasta and snappy Italian Beans.

Refreshing the palate with Lemon Sorbetto, the icy texture needing a bit of work, another special of Braised Veal Short Rib ate much like Osso Bucco with both the White Wine of the braising liquid and spicy Greens serving as balance, a small portion of the deconstructed Lasagna using a similar cut of Meat every bit as excellent when baked with Mozzarella.

Rounding out the evening with half-portions of Butter Rum Cake and Tiramisu, both made by Marc's Wife, desserts were well made if not a little predictable, the only other option offered a Cr√®me Brulee that seems more ""Summerlin"" than Italian in a place where something like Canolli, Budino or even an Italian Cookie Plate would better round out the night.

****Without doubt the most creative Italian spot on the West side of the Valley, and in the conversation for most labor intensive kitchen off-strip, Trattoria shows Chef Marc back in his element creating great food and welcoming guests to his kitchen, a work in progress that is already pretty great",2016-08-07 19:43:51

The Gyro itself is a three-star Affair. So was what your wife had last year.

It doesn't taste very good and the sauce is lacking something. Mike & Tony's nearby is much better. However I do like they are open extremely late and usually full of hot drunk people.

 I also really like the chemical tasting lime iced tea that they sell because I mean who sells lime iced tea these days?

However the reason I reduce this down to a one is because I had an awful customer service experience with the owner. The super cute girl who was serving me was flirting with me and I was returning the favor and enjoying it. It was cold outside and very late and I sat down to eat my gyro and suddenly the owner yells at me. And I mean really yells at me and tells me to get out no more eating in. He says this even as about 15 other people are still sitting down eating meals that are much bigger than my gyro and going through them pretty slowly and engaged in conversations.

So I get up and leave and at this point the cute girl starts telling me that I can actually stay and having an argument with the owner about it and the owner demands that nobody else be allowed to sit down and eat. This year o is not particularly big. I would have finished it in three minutes. I was parked out front so I ate in my car instead. When I drove away about 10 minutes later there was still at least 10 people sitting down and eating in there.

This year I suggested a different plan:
Mom will take the kids.
We'll go on a day that's NOT a Saturday and NOT a wristband day. I'll be prepared to spend $75 a kid on rides (I spend more than that at Disneyland). We'll eat before we leave the house so that we only buy drinks and a snack ($20 limit). We will enjoy the FREE exhibits as much as possible, although admittedly my kids are not into animals--or the smell; oh well). We will go when Fair Admission is $1 or less and we'll park in the $5 lot.
That day was yesterday: Opening Day. Great weather. 
No bitching about prices (I set a budget, remember?). 
No lines (we got there at 1pm and left at 5:30pm).

Primanti in Cranberry on Freedom Road.   

Service was about  a 2 on the 4 times we went there.
Parking excellent however.  Easy to get there, and find a space.

Food -- well, just a variant of Olive Garden's canned/packaged materials.  

A nice place to visit.  And an okay place to eat.  

But against real competition in the foodie world, not so much.

I used to go to that old location, and missed it during the hiatus following the partial building collapse.

The food is always pretty good, the prices are reasonable, and the portions are large.  I love the Siam noodles and the Golden/Yellow Curry is great too.  There just aren't enough Thai places in Toronto where you can buy Golden Curry.

A few cons for an otherwise great place:
- The young ladies who assign tables and call out names can seem clueless at times.  On one occasion, they insisted that we put our name on the list, although there was a table ready.  They turned around momentarily, and called our name 10 seconds later.  Even though we didn't move in that time, they looked over the crowd behind uswhile calling our name - they obviously had forgotten who we were in the 10 seconds since they greeted us.

- The spice level is inconsistent.  Tonight we had 3 dishes.  One with no chillies, one with 3 chillies, and one with 10 chillies.  The 3 chilly pepper dish was actually hotter than the 10 chilly pepper dish.

I have frankly never been to a place like this, but to enjoy and benefit from it most, I found it very useful to visit their website before going there. I otherwise would have felt overwhelmed by choice when I walked in. They offer a variety of salads, paninis, wraps, juices, soups and other items in an essentially healthy vein as opposed to other fast foods. Their web site allowed me to completely understand all nutritional and caloric elements of what I might order. It also allowed me to clearly understand that salad and health don't automatically add up, although they offer lots of healthy options.

I've been there four times in the past week, once for a freshly made juice (green detox), once to have a dine in salad (the Ty Cobb) and soup (Jalapeno & Tomatillo Gazpacho). and twice to pick up custom salads to consume at home. 

First of all, they have very creative standard and seasonal offerings that run the gamut of flavor combinations and include vegan, organic, gluten free and dairy free options. The calorie and nutrient range is broad, and you can order their regular offerings, or create your own to specification.

I loved my initial Ty Cobb salad, but didn't realize that the calories identified on their menu don't appear to include the dressing, since they make a recommendation, but it is a matter of choice. The salad was excellent. They offer salads in regular and big sizes. I found the regular to be a generous meal for me. 

To their credit, they allow tastes of items to aid your choice from a flavor perspective. They also allow you to swap certain elements of their standard menu offerings.

I love the element of choice here, and I love their nutrition calculator on the website that fills you in on everything from cholesterol and sodium to fat, protein and other key nutrient elements as you add or remove components of a dish. It's like my pre-dining entertainment. I also like that I can order my selection on line (standard, or as I custom as I could imagine) for pick up with no wait in line in about 15 minutes. 

This location just opened this month, and the staff is still learning the ropes to some degree, but they are friendly, helpful and attentive. The focus of mad greens is their commitment to high quality, organic and local ingredients. They are also committed to fair trade

Their Cannellini Beans have become a staple in my salads here, and I love the spicy avocado (avocado and their mad spice). I am hooked on the slow-roasted chicken and the fat free balsamic vinaigrette. Even so, I haven't had the same salad twice.

I think it will be a long time before I get tired of dining here. You should note, it is not inexpensive, but I think the prices are fair for the quality and quantity.",2015-09-30 19:22:17

No complaints there at all. But the clincher was the food. For a starter my wife and I shared the walnut pate which was great, but nothing more than the walnut raisin cream cheese you can find at a bagel shop...minus the raisins. For entrees, we got the pumpkin curry and the pad thai, both of which were pretty bland (the curry was a bit spicy, but nothing else). They left a very blah taste in our mouths. Finally, for dessert, we had the pumpkin pie, which looked and tasted like stale baklava, and the pear ""ice cream"" (it's in quotes because it's not real ice cream, just sorbet that was food processed), which didn't taste like much at all.

Decided to go into Chinatown and found a Lee's Sandwiches. It is pretty big and spacious for people to eat and escape from the hot outdoor weather. The best part is the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. The juice is warm because it's freshly squeezed from the stalks, so stir the liquid up and enjoy the sweet, refreshing sugar cane juice. The sandwiches were tasty, but the baguettes are a bit softer than I'm used to. Still thoroughly enjoyed every part of my meal. They do charge for extra veggies, so I didn't get it. It is great for a Lee's in the desert.

Came with the wifey for a quick weekday lunch, opting for one of their various specials for only $6.95.  With the lunch special you get:  choice of several different entrees, fried rice, hot & sour or egg drop soup, and a small house salad.  Not a bad deal per se, but with the number of all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets around this area, Pad Thai Restaurant does fight for patrons.  Just saying!

Their lunch service is quick, you really can be in and out of the restaurant within 30 minutes.  I had the lunch special of their Kungpao Chicken, and it was a bit underwhelming.  The portion size was OK, I would have expected more on the plate.  The flavor was good and not overly salty, but there were too many undercooked & crunchy carrots and celery in the dish.  Not enough time in the wok!  The over crunch made the dish texture somewhat off.  Not my favorite dish, should have gone with their namesake and ordered the pad thai!  Their fried rice was very good though even if it was a simple interpretation, I think a touch of fish sauce may be what adds flavor to it.  The egg roll?  Tasty!  I was surprised, it might actually be fresh made instead of frozen.  Props to that.  The hot & sour soup was also a surprise, it was indeed hot AND sour, but not overpowering on either end.  Even the simple salad was good with their house dressing.  If I had to guess there is some mayonnaise in it.  Tip, add some black pepper to the salad, kicks it up a flavor notch.  Overall I enjoyed the side dishes with the lunch special more than the entr√©e itself, hence the lower star rating.  It's partially my fault though, why order a Chinese dish in a Thai establishment?  Next time I will stay with Thai!  Maybe a curry!

With the combination of low season & dining hour, reservations are not necessary at all.

All the staff I came into contact were professional and quite hospitable.  

My server allowed me to choose seating inside the restaurant & suggested facing the mall for a good view.  

The sommelier was sharp w/wine & threw in a FREE wine flight.  I was loaded: 3 EXTRA 2 oz glasses of wines to sample, all fantastic.  One from the Willamette Valley-currently my favorite region.

Boa bread is normally baked in house at the Southern CA locations.  In LV, they bake their own rosemary rolls, reminiscent of the texture of a biscuit, but fluffier & nicely scented.  I couldn't finish the whole roll and packed it away for later.

I was given the option of ordering from the dinner menu also.  My server was unsure if the Steak Tartare was available and I let him know I would be more than happy to replace that item with a petite filet.  He could have easily told me the lower priced item was unavailable, and garnered a larger tip with the bigger ticket item, but he didn't.  

Snacked on:
Prime Steak Tartare $16
Simple, elegant presentation, all the ingredients mixed at the table.  I loved that I was aware of everything being put into my food.

Baby Greens $9
Large amounts of mixed greens lightly dressed.  

TO-GO item:
Steak sandwich $14
Generous strips of tri tip on ciabiatta bread & a creamy fragrant sauce.  The shoe string fries were sprinkled with herbs.  

Total tab: $65.73

A steal for a glass of wine while dining, FREE wine flight, a light snack, a glass of wine to go while shopping and TWO more mini-meals.

While I wouldn't actually categorize this place as hole in the wall, I noticed some of the reviews seemed concerned about that. I wouldn't be. This is like going to El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell. During my stay in Scottsdale I went twice. Once for breakfast, and once for Lunch. 

Breakfast was absolutely delicious, with one small exception. I had a Bacon burrito with rice added (I highly recommend adding rice to breakfast burritos! its good). It was well wrapped, not too messy, plenty huge, and easy to eat in the car. The one complaint I had was the cheese. It was this bright neon orange gelatinous stuff. It just tasted oily and not very good. 

I also had the Super Nachos or Nachos supreme or whatever its called. Same problem, the cheese was just too greasy and oily. It didn't have much flavor. On the plus side, they pile on the sour cream, guacamole, and meat. It would have been nice to have some beans on the nachos too though.

Maybe they're just pleasantly surprised to find a semi-ok place in a practically defunct mall? Maybe this was just an off-day for the chef? Maybe I'll never know.

Ambiance: They made the place look pretty nice! You almost forget you're in a mall.

Service: Definitely friendly enough and timely enough, except the secondary server / busboy was wearing so much cologne we assumed he'd bathed in it and expected him to give us a sales pitch for it. It literally -- and I'm using that word as it's intended, not in a figurative way -- stung our nostrils every time he came by to refill our waters. That's a huge turnoff when people are trying to eat/smell/taste things. I can't believe the mangers let him work like that. Our actual waiter didn't have the same problem. Also, just like a couple other Mexican places around town, be prepared for multiple people to try to get you to order their guacamole. I love guac, but I hate up-selling.

Food: The free chips & salsa at the beginning are pretty decent. The chips will remind you of Mundo, if you ever went there. The salsa is a tad on the bitter/fire-roasted side, so if you like that style, you'll really dig it. Not very spicy st all. We ordered the calamari and the carne asada chile relleno. Calamari is grilled, FYI - not sure if we just didn't see that or it didn't say. It had a good flavor, but included way less for the money than most similar offerings, so don't expect to get a whole plate of it. For $10, you get maybe 8-10 small pieces and some salad. The chile relleno was a let down, especially since it's listed as a ""fan favorite"" on their site. It's basically meat, potatoes, mushrooms, rice, & beans in a large green chili with red sauce & a bit of cream. The meat was ok, but not as flavorful as I expect carne asada to be. The biggest issue with it was that the potatoes were not cooked all the way through; we ended up not being able to eat many of them. The red sauce it was bathed in was very odd, way too bitter & smoky for our taste (so take their salsa, which was good, and turn up the bitterness & smokiness until it's obnoxious, and that's how the sauce seemed). That could just be us, though, even though he usually really enjoys smoky sauces.

NOTES: You should know that the happy hour just changed (today, apparently) and is now 7-10pm instead of 5-7. My loss, your gain! Also, don't get your hopes up for sangria, cause it's not (at least not currently) on the menu.

Though I certainly appreciate friendly service, it doesn't outweigh the taste of your food (and the under-cooked-ness of it), especially when it's supposed to be a house special of sorts. I plan to come back and try a couple other things and will update this review if those things warrant an extra star.",2016-07-20 01:34:24

We ordered a bunch of items from the carts the come around. And they come around very quickly so you're not just sitting there waiting for your food.

Luckily the noodles were good - the right elasticity and texture, and the soup broths were decent. The spicy one was not spicy at all, but the pork one had actual ginseng in it. I wish there was more vegetables in each bowl.

We stopped by just after they opened for dinner on a Saturday, following a show at Blumenthal.  It wasn't crowded at this time, and we were seated immediately.  

The restaurant has a nice vibe.  It's decor is chic contemporary, the tables are nicely spaced, and, when we visited, they played awesome rock music (think Arctic Monkeys, Cage the Elephant, etc.).  

I started with a Cat's Meow beverage (my husband had club soda).  The Cat's Meow was slightly--but not overly--sweet, and I enjoyed it very much.

Bread is extra, but just $3 a basket.  You get a decent-sized French roll, sliced and toasted, served with an onion butter.  It was delicious, and we'd likely get it again.  

For appetizers, we had the clam chowder (me) and apple endive salad (him).  The clam chowder was a bit pricy for the portion ($9 for a bowl), but it was very good.  If you're a fan of thicker chowders like I am, you'll like this dish.  My husband's salad was huge, and very good.  At $10, those with lighter appetites could eat this as an entree, especially with the option of adding a protein. 

For our entrees, I had the smoked trout risotto, and my husband had the mahi with beets. The trout was definitely the better value, at $18 for a huge portion.  I'm a huge fan of smoked trout, and every bite had a piece of trout.  The dish was topped with a poached egg.  While I'm not a fan of poached eggs, I do love poached egg YOLKS, so I split the egg, and mixed the yolk into the risotto.  This was a very creative dish, and I loved it!

My husband's mahi with beets tasted delicious, but it was a small plate (think just a bit bigger than tapas style) for $25.  He's not sure he'd get this again, just due to the value per portion size.  Those with lighter appetites would likely love this, however.

I want to begin by saying that the individuals at this location STARTED OFF being friendly. They acted as though they wanted my business. We test drove some cars, & I was a fan of the Kia Forte. Keep in mind,.. this was a 2016 forte which is now,... 2 years old being that there are 2018 models. Side note: our car salesman kept saying that I had negative equity on my car and it really ticked me off because I did NOT have negative equity. Negative equity is when you are upside down. I was not nearly upside down, I have a high credit score & i did not care for the demeaning attitude of the people at this place. Anyways, when we started talking numbers, I could see that they clearly did not want our business. No efforts were made to negotiate, & there was just no effort whatsoever.

Located on the 2nd floor across from the Rave Movie Theater and opposite Cadillac Ranch, Lolita's is in a prime location of Town Square.

They serve complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Black Bean Dip.  I'm not a fan of Black Beans, but it tasted pretty good.  The Salsa could have been more spicy.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go for the Carne Asada Nachos ($13.99).  I asked the waitress for really spicy Salsa on the side.

After a short wait our food came out.  The Nachos were tasty, but they were really salty!  The Carne Asada was juicy and had good flavor.....but the Salty Chips overwhelmed any of the good flavors in the dish.  The extra Spicy Salsa I requested was very hot.....perfect!

We shared the Roasted Farm Vegetables. (see photo)
They looked like broken down leftovers that were full of grease and were sort of burnt. The vegetables came with a very non-traditional romesco. (romesco is suppose to be a red pepper nut sauce)

My husband asked for his Aioli Burger with the aioli on the side but that request was ignored so he sent it back. Big mistake...I don't know what they did but it seemed like they washed the burger off and threw it back on the heat......because.....
Instead of a ""Pink"" Burger (you order pink or well) he received a petrified burger and pulled it out of his sandwich and said to me that it was dryer than a Burger King Patty and too dry to feed our dogs. The girl working the counter said that she was sorry but it wasn't her fault because she ordered the burger correctly.

The other girl from the kitchen came out to clear the plates saw the dried up burger and said she'd make a new one but we were passing out the door to leave so we just left.

We previously told them we expected 40-50 people. Needless to say, we ended up having about 30 people standing up the entire time. We all wanted to order food, but without sufficient tables, there was nowhere for us to actually eat the food. 

We asked if we could get additional tables or be seated elsewhere, and they said NO because the tables were for customers. (?!?) the restaurant was about 80-90% empty at this point. 

We tried to sit at the nearly empty bar, but the shoo'd us away because they said they were expecting customers. I'm not sure what they thought we were, but we were a group of 40-50 teachers (who made reservations) at the end of the school year. If anyone is going to order a ton of drinks, it is a group of teachers at the end of the school year. 

From the moment we walked in, they constantly told us we weren't customers, even though we had called weeks ahead and reserved an area. We had all planned on drinking and ordering a lot of food. They didn't want to serve us and made it very clear. 

Our server was hostile. When I spoke to the manager, she said, ""what do you want me to do about it? The seating areas are for customers."" Also, the manager told us we couldn't stand near the tables because of fire code. Have I mentioned that the restaurant was 80% empty and they refused to seat us or allow to sit at the bar? They basically gave us a 10x10 area to stand in.

QqzWaAFFXVahTWR9FDp9PQ,_GlVJpZzWnncLH-DJ4dgmg,zgAecXWgPlkthxKPR6Dtcg,1,9,4,4,"I suspect this place is on the verge of going under and after today's experience, that would seem to be for good reason.  In the past, we've ordered the thin crust Meat Hater's pizza with the addition of black olives and found it to be a delicious, fresh mix of ingredients.  We've tried the veggie balls which were also great, but today made the mistake of ordering the Caesar salad as a starter.  Yikes!  What a disgusting and inedible mess!  We missed the notation on the menu that the lettuce was grilled, but nonetheless, taking a head of romaine, cutting it in half and pursuing to turn it into charcoal, topped with some stale croutons and a squeeze-bottle application of some ""dressing"" is an utterly disgusting combination.  We stopped after one bite.

Let's move on to the pizza.  It arrived with kalamata olives rather than the black olives that we had ordered.  Now maybe to some people, an olive is an olive, but these two types of olives have distinctly different flavors.  One belongs on a pizza, the other on a Greek salad.  When I asked our bartender/server, Alisha about this, she insisted these are the same olives they have always had. They certainly are not or we would not have ordered an item that we proceeded to pick off of the pizza due to it's off-putting taste.  Finally, she spoke with the ""chef"" who admitted that these are indeed different olives.  Really???  She politely took the inedible salad and olive upcharge off of our bill for which we were appreciative until we got home and assessed the half of the 16"" pizza that she had crammed into a tiny to-go container.  In the past, we'd taken half of the pizza with us and brought it home in a normal pizza box.  This time, we arrived home and opened a tiny foil container to find a pile of wet, soggy goo.  Alisha had somehow managed to cram an entire half of a 16"" pizza into a shallow, 8"" round foil container by stacking and mashing the pizza into an inedible mass of slimy goo.

Needless to say, there are far better pizza places in Scottsdale that offer consistent food and responsible service.  We've never seen more than a handful of other patrons here at the most and this is likely why. There is no need to waste your money at this place and we certainly will not return.",2016-07-18 23:14:13

UNOEw5zFtmaxCclv2_R-Dw,QYobbHEmhLGuS6QDqVRTLw,74Ev0iqPnrmh4i7Wj4PMOw,5,13,5,6,"WOW! All I can say is WOW! Up till now, Zebra was the best restaurant in Charlotte that I ate at. Now, it's Barrington's! My best friends were visiting from TN, and I wanted to treat them for their Birthdays (There were 3 of them visiting). I knew it wouldn't be cheap but what the heck....you only live once, right?

Now understand that me and my group of friends are real ""foodies."" We've had the fortune at eating at some of the best restaurants in the country. Not bragging, just giving some context here. So we typically go ""all out"" when possible, and given the special nature of this night, we certainly went ""all out.""

So, to start the dinner off, we ordered the French Onion soup AND TWO pasta dishes since I read that they are famous for their pasta. This was basically ""for the table"" (i.e., we made it family style). My GOD. The French Onion soup was nothing like I've ever had before. Obviously reconstructed to a fine, modern twist. It didn't have your regular ""toasty cheese"" on top. Oh no.....it had a fine ""cheese FOAM"" in the center which was like a rich, cheesy sour cream but way better. The Onions were sweet and savory. Just about the best I've ever had! The pasta? IF you ever come here, you've GOT to order the gnocchi! It was freakin phenomenal! Don't know how else to say it. It had fresh parmesan, braised veal and porcini mushrooms which was layered with elegant yet powerful flavors. That sounds contradictory......you get the picture. It was GREAT!

As if the pasta and soup weren't enough, we also added the Foie Gras. I mean, how could you NOT order Foie Gras if it's on the menu! It was wrapped in Prosciutto, over a homemade fig bar surrounded by a blackberry sauce. Again, RIDICULOUSLY good!

We're basically full at this point. BUT we've GOT to brave more food! So we got the Ashley Farms chicken, the Crispy Duck and the Beef Short Ribs. Again, WOW! My gourmand buddies BOTH said that it was the BEST duck they've ever had! And I assure you that we've eaten LOTS of little duckies in our lived. This one had to be brinned for days as it was UBER moist......practically melt in your mouth. Yet he kept the skin crispy. That my friends takes great cooking technique. Same with the chicken. The skin was the best part...you can see the bird was pressed down to ensure even cooking while getting the skin very crispy. Some of the best chicken I've ever had, and probably THE BEST my friend had. The shortribs were also delicious. Not the best I've ever had (that goes to Roy's out West), but certainly the best in Charlotte! Oh and just for you know what and giggles, we ordered all 3 of the side dishes: Truffle Mashed potatoes, Garlic Spinach and Roasted Mushroom. Verdict for the main courses and sides? Just incredible!

Now we're WAY overstuffed. So we get dessert. Why not? We do ""cut back"" and only order 2 desserts (but 3 portions). My friends all got the warm chocolate pudding cake. This title is misleading......it's more like a souffle, a flour-less one! Everything is made in house, including their ice cream. This was a decadent dish, a dream for chocolate lovers. I got the warm cinnamon bun, with some of THE BEST ice cream I've ever had....a brown butter pecan ice cream. We all suggested to the waitress that the Chef sell this in the grocery stores. It was uber yummy! All over a CARAMEL drizzled bun.

Now, here's what I think many people overlook. While the did have a decent and affordable wine list, my group and I are REAL oenophiles. Not snobs by any means, just true wine lovers. So I did some research and found out that Barrington's only charges a $20.00 corkage fee. This is VERY low for a high quality dining establishment. So I brought 3 very special wines from my cellar, and figured at $20/bottle, so $60.00 total for 3 wines that could have totaled $2000.00 in some restaurants (I told you we went all out). So I thought that was a steal. When I got the bill (yes, I paid!) I saw that they only charged me $20 for ALL the wine I brought! Again, WOW!

Finally, I was STUNNED by the final bill. Here we go ""all out"" and I was thinking maybe $500.00 or something for the FOUR of us. But no, It was under $300.00. Not cheap by any means. BUT keep in mind that we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 full pasta dishes (which are entrees), 4 other entrees, all 3 sides, and 3 desserts. That my friends is a LOT of food. For under $300? For 4 people? I mean, you couldn't possibly order more food. This was a food lovers paradise and the bill was incredibly reasonable!

Out in Las Vegas this mean would have been $1000.00+!!! I can NOT believe at how reasonable the prices are in this restaurant. Again, please keep in mind that this is a FINE DINING establishment! So when I say ""reasonable"" I'm comparing it to other restaurants of similar quality. From that perspective, it's a STEAL!

Both my best male friends said it was THE BEST MEAL of their lives. It was in my Top 5 for sure.That is a TREMENDOUS compliment to the Chef and this restaurant.",2013-11-02 13:08:25

Every time I order I get something I like and many things I don't like. And it doesn't seem to be getting better. Because of this I think I'm done with Silver Mine. Here are my reasons:

-The Veggies: I've never had bad veggies. They are always fresh and quite generous. I am excluding the avocado.
-You can order late either over the phone or online for delivery or take-out. 

The Bad:
-The Bread: it's overly soft and squishy. While it holds up under sauce it gets really squishy really fast and is quite tasteless.
-The avocado: well, it's more like avocado spread. And it's tasteless. 

The Ugly:
-The chicken: it's often full of fat and questionable tasting.

The reason it gets so much business is that the space is large enough to host several people during lunch. The food is just okay at best. I had not been here for nearly a year, but gVe it a shot today because it was drizzling outside and I didn't want to walk far. This was around 3:00. However, after ordering only soup, it took 6 minutes to get my soup. There was no line in front of me. The manager was  talking to a staff member and given the time, I could have made it myself 3x in the time it took. When there is a line, 6 minutes is okay. When you're just waiting on someone to take the initiative to make your order, it's unacceptable. 

On top of that, the food here isn't great. My crab and corn chowder was salty. There are no discernible pieces of crab in the soup. I think it's just crab flavored. In the past, when I got sandwiches, the sub bread is far too thick and flavorless.

It was fairly early (around 2PM) so we didn't want a heavy meal.  The Yard seemed to fit the bit so we headed on up to the second floor above Yovi's Hotdog place.  It was surprisingly crowded with lots of families.  That is great to see in downtown Pittsburgh on a bleary cold February afternoon.  In the not so distant past, downtown was a ghost town on weekends except for sports and Cultural District patrons.  Hurrah for the turnaround!

We have tried the Yard a few times for their awesome selection of draft beers and decent happy hour music selection but it had been a while since we actually ate there.  The menu is mostly bar food highlighted by a page full of variations on the grilled cheese theme.  I like their grilled cheeses but then, I'm a real Texas Toast lover so that's not a surprise.

I tried out the Yard Walker sandwich with chicken, bacon, cheddar, and garlic aioli with lettuce and tomato and red onion on a brioche bun. It was just okay, not great but not horrible either.  I think it needed seasoning like salt and pepper or something because it was a little bland, to be honest.  

For a side, I substituted fresh cut thin sliced French fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled on them and herbs.  They were supposed to be garlic parm but I detected very little garlic.  They were fresh and slightly crispy and the right portion.  My gf ordered the poutine fries that come with gravy, cheese curds, short ribs, and beer cheese.  They came in a metal bowl and were essentially a HUGE LIMP GLOB of melted cheese and fries. They were sort of bland too.  Disappointing and not even good the next day.

The theme begins when you enter the theater as the people checking tickets are in character and will ask questions like how many chickens you own. The staff is very welcoming and I saw them even getting booster seats for kids that wouldn't be able to see well otherwise.

I did feel a little dense because I didn't understand the story. As we were leaving my mom admitted that she didn't get it either so I felt a little better. The actual performance, music, and entertainment was so good that it didn't really bother me that I didn't understand the story. 

The performers jump around the seating area before the show starts sneaking up on the audience. The interaction was cool, but I thought it might be a bit creepy for kids. The whole production is jaw dropping. The stage alone had me interested because of all of the different ways it moved and the amazing way the performers moved with the stage.

This place is located inside The Mandalay Bay hotel and you can conveniently park at their parking lot (Paid!). The Foundation Room is a rather small place that is divided into an outdoor/balcony area on one side and a club/lounge area on the other side which makes it pretty interesting. Unfortunately, there is very little room to dance so don't count too much on that... 

The best thing about this place is definitely the view. If you stand outside, you can get a view of the whole strip.

The drinks are good and service is ok, except when the place gets very crowded late in the evening. It can be hard to get drinks then. One good thing about this place is the decor/atmosphere which makes it pretty unique in Las Vegas. Expect to pay $12 for most drinks event though girls can sometimes get free drinks tickets.

We went on a bustling Friday night and were immediately seated in the bar area. I love the look of the place; from the white washed brick to the cool slotted walls. The decor is very hip and trendy. There is even a DJ, but beware it does get quite loud in there. The lighting was also a little weird, my husband basically had a spotlight on his side of the table and anytime something white (a plate or napkin) hit the light it was blinding. 

After taking in the scenery, we were greeted with melted bleu cheese bread with a chive dipping sauce. Bleu cheese is one of those things that you either love or hate and unfortunately I hate it. I found it an odd choice since it does have such a strong flavor, but I was able to enjoy the middle of the bread and the sauce was very different from anything I had tasted before.

We started with the foie gras french toast and it was disgusting! It is literally french toast, a roasted apple, and a giant slab of foie gras. I can see how it would work for some people but it just didn't work at all for me. We went out on a limb on this one and we fell out of the tree!

My husband got the bone in rib-eye and it was heaven. It was the perfect combination of fat and meat. I had the small filet and it was also spectacular. It was tender, even though I like my meat on the well done side. We didn't opt for any toppings but we did try the chimichurri sauce and it really wasn't worth it. The steaks came with a small side of onions and they were an unexpected highlight. I had regular sauteed onions but my husband had spicy onions that were delicious with the steak. They absolutely know how to cook a mouth-watering steak here!

We also tried 2 sides, but both were disappointing. The mac and cheese would be absolutely stunning if it had any flavor at all. It has a perfect crispy topping and is cheesy but there is really no flavor. Even a little salt would have taken the dish to the next level. 

We also tried the mushroom pot pie. When the server brought it out I was so excited to dive into it, but then the unthinkable happened, he cut the top off and dumped it on a plate! I wanted to scream out, but resisted the urge. The mushroom flavor was so overpowering and I love mushrooms. It really needed more pastry, we only had the thin top and it was buried under all the filling. It was so sad.

Overall, the service was great and the steak was delicious, but what's a steak without sides? There are many other places in Vegas that can cook a great steak and provide me with excellent side options. Sorry STK you and I are just not meant to be.",2011-07-09 06:48:43

Oh Julian, your tapas on the strip is over-priced but its worth every penny.

PRICE: Tapas adds up after a while. At Firefly, most of my orders are in the $4-8 price range. At Serrano, my usual orders are in the $10-16. That's nearly double what I normally spend but on occasion, I like to splurge and enjoy a more upscale meal in a setting 100% more luxurious than local favorite Firefly.

FOOD: You get what you pay for. My favorites at Firefly are stuffed dates, shrimp ceviche, and lamb skewers. I've tried each of their counterparts at Serrano. And I have to admit that they do each one better. The flavors are more complex and refined. The dates are melt-in-your-mouth good. The quality of meat (in this case lamb) at Serrano is more tender and less game-y. I've tried all of the ceviches here and each and every one is extremely fresh and flavorful. Firefly's ceviche tends to be a little heavy on the lemon and on occasion I'll get a fishy one. I tend to order more seafood at Serrano as well. I feel like all the hot seafood tapas I've ordered here are spot on. Some of the best seafood dishes I've eaten in Vegas--period.

SANGRIA: I'm sorry Serrano, but I have to say Firefly does this one better. I don't doubt for a second that there's a lot involved in making the sangria here. But there's something so familiar and delicious about the red wine sangria at Fireflys. The delicate balance of fruit and wine flavor has been perfected. And hey, you can't beat the 50% off pitchers of Sangria during Firefly Happy Hour.

SERVICE: In a fine dining setting, I'm very particular about my service. If I'm paying a fine dining price & tip, I expect to be waited on appropriately. Every time I've been here my server has been quite attentive and friendly. I've only once been dissatisfied with my service; but it was a holiday and the place was ridiculously crowded.

If your wondering if its worth the money, then YES! Don't hesitate because you think you get a better value at Firefly. Firefly will always be a favorite close to my heart but when I want to eat a little finer and I want to pay for it--Julian Serrano is my upscale tapas of choice.

Turned out to be not my cup of tea for so many different reasons.

First of all it is very difficult making a right turn into the hotel because cars pulling into the hotel share the same light as pedestrians - and there are throngs of them at all times!  Be prepared to sit in traffic and wait.  Better yet make a left turn into the hotel from the opposite side of the Strip.

I like to feel that wow factor from the moment I check in to a hotel to when I check out.  I certainly did not feel that vibe in the hotel registration area.  There was nothing grand about it and I certainly could not feel it with the clientele there (think fried 80's style perms).  

Then there's the rooms.  We reserved one of the updated Red Rooms but my hotel room at the Hampton Inn for a work trip was even nicer.  The hotel, even with the renovation, just screamed old, and the rooms were small.  Bathroom towels were thin and rough and many of them were dirty.  In addition the only mirrors were in the bathroom - not female friendly :p

Worst of all: cobblestone on the casino floor leading up to the guest elevators.  Talk about not being female friendly!  Hard enough to walk on that kind of floor in flats so imagine high heels!  

The good thing about the hotel is its location (if you are walking).  Was easy to get to Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, and Bellagio where we did a lot of our eating and shopping.  Also, Sugar Factory is right there and they have good food and good celebrity spotting at times.  (Heard good things about Gordon Ramsay Steak but didn't eat there on that trip.)

I had to try this place...after hearing amazing reviews...

So after waiting 45 minutes for a table (even though I did make reservations for 8pm) we finally got our table.  (I know that a lot of you like the decor...I just wasn't feeling it...a little too basic for me)  After being seated..it took another 20 minutes to have the General Manager come over to ask us if we have been asked for drinks yet.  I replied that nobody has even greeted us yet.  He took our drink order (I got this Pomegrante and Sunflower Iced Tea...which was AMAZING...weird since I HATE flavored tea) and he even took time to explain the menu to us.  Since we still didn't have a server yet, the GM (now I know his name is Moe) took our orders and even offered suggestions. We ended up with (I wish I wrote down the actual names of the dishes) Shrimp Tempura (out of this world), Cucumber Roll with this amazing plum sauce, this tasty salmon roll with asparagus, beef skewers, and scallops that were AWESOME with this AWESOME mayonaise in the center.  

Of course since their servings were extremely small and my friend Karla and I were sharing...I needed some dessert.  I got the Strawberry and Honey Chawan Mushi with Apple Pear, Passion Fruit, and Banana.  First of all, it looks like salsa, the way the fruit was chopped up.  Then I tasted it.  Ewwww....not good at all.  Moe felt bad, knowing that we had to clean our palattes...so gave us vanilla sorbet and green tea ice cream instead...on the house and even took off the other dessert.

Moe Rules!

I didn't find the place to be too pricey...I have been to worse.  I even played a game with my friend about guessing the price.  She guessed $78....and I said $ 57.63.  I didn't even add up anything in my head.  The bill came out and it was $ 57.85.  (My friend thought I had some amazing psychic powers...)

Classic Italian style- decided on the Prosciutto and Pomodorini. This was my favorite of the two. The fresh arugula and the cherry tomatoes adding some acidity. Also this dough had more of a crisp to it. amazing!

Anyway, I saw a friend check into Isshin Ramen on another competing local app that has points and badges and stuff and I thought ""why not try out Isshin Ramen"". So I did. Here's my review:

I am absolutely torn between each ramen joint that pops up. While the decor isn't quite as nice as say Kinton, Santouka or Raijin, I would say their ramen is among the best that Toronto has to offer. I mean outside of hopping on a plane and flying to Japan to get the most authentic experience, you'd be hard pressed to not be satisfied by the ramen and side plates that Isshin has to offer.

In terms of the dishes I've had - I had the takoyaki, which was absolutely scrumptious as an appetizer, the mentaiko don and the garlicky shoyu ramen which was a killer combination in terms of value for money.

They've really maintained the level of quality that you would expect from its predecessors (not by much).  If you're ever in the Little Italy area and having a hankering for slurping up some ramen to the last drop - Isshin Ramen is the place to be!",2014-04-08 00:09:27

This restaurant offers convenient and quiet dining in a relatively intimate environment.  The restaurant is clean and quite inviting.  Something that caught my eye immediately were the cool wall accents which changed colors every so often: a nice touch. 

The menu is pretty robust as it offers dishes across a spectrum of Asian cuisines including Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese.  I really appreciated the staff's willingness to accommodate my request for vegetarian egg rolls, which were quite delicious.   For my main meal I had a tofu and broccoli dish which was not only tasty, but spicy just as I requested.  The quantity of food was tremendous;, the price was fair.  Service was absolutely fantastic.

Generally speaking it's tough to find Vietnamese places that cater to vegetarians.  While the traditional Vietnamese fare can be found here, it would be nice to see something like vegetarian pho on the menu.

I'm not sure what I was missing out but there wasn't anything special about this place except maybe their decor and drinks. Pretty much chic and rustic interior, which I like.  

Drinks - Venus & Simplicity - they were perfect for a hot summer day. Venus was on the fruity side with the lychee juice, Simplicity was simply simple, lmao. They do have a good beer selection as well for those beer lovers out there. 

Food - We decided to try their shared plates thinking there would be plenty to share but we were wrong. We got to try their fried cheese, tuna crudo $14, scallops, and angry devil eggs. The fried cheese tasted a bit salty for me plus not really a shared plate with just 5 small fried cheese log. I'm going to guess an inch long. Kind of disappointed. Tuna crudo with mango and kiwi salsa, came with 3 slices of tuna. It tasted fresh and light but i was hoping there would be a little more so I can share it with my friends. Scallops came with 2 and according to my friend Teri W., it tasted moist and yummy! Deviled eggs - angry indeed because it had a bacon hint + spicy goodness. 

Both of my friend and I ordered their gnocchi and I was disappointed. The beef was dry and their wasn't enough sauce to dress it with. The gnocchi itself was salty and a bit overcooked. There were like 2 or 3 asparagus strands which was ehh. I like vegetables and this plate was just a bite to eat. I left the place hungry...and I think the food is overpriced.

What I really like about eating at this restaurant is that it does not get too smokey.  So I can come here and not smell like I spent at least an hour in a smoker.  The waitresses are nice and some are really pleasant to look at too.

Like most of the other Korean BBQ restaurants in town, the waitresses here will cook the meat orders for you at the table.  And the restaurant do get really busy when conventions with Korean companies are in town, but not too bad the rest of the times.

It's located in this shoddy looking strip plaza, but don't be fooled, because when you go in the place is surprisingly spacious. When I went on a Sunday for lunch with my parents, every single table was full, but customers tend to come in and out pretty quickly so we didn't have to wait very long. Their menu is simple, and if anything I would complain that the selection is kind of lacking... in terms of noodles, they really only have three toppings you can get in your noodles: shrimp wonton, beef brisket, and dace fish ball, which is less so than other places. But prices really can't be beat! It's only $6 for a bowl of noodles if you get one or two toppings, and as other reviewers have noted, the shrimp wontons are soooo big.

Service: Attentive, but if anything maybe too attentive? It was like once we sat down at the table, the waitress was by our side, expectantly waiting for us to order... and we hadn't even really looked at the menu yet. We were talking amongst ourselves, and she kept interjecting to clarify things, which I guess was okay, but then she just kept lurking around, and it made me feel a bit uncomfortable and like we were being pressured to order quickly. I do realize that's just the way they do things though, everything was so quick, quick, quick, and rapid. Our food came out probably less than 5 minutes after we placed our order, and we were sitting right by the kitchen, so we could see them just rapidly filling bowl after bowl with noodles and soup. 

Food: Delicious! For some reason my mother found the broth to be salty, but conversely, I thought it was really light in flavour and if anything even too light. But they give you lots of condiments (i.e. hot sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce) that you can add yourself. And again, you definitely get a decent amount of food for your money. I think at first I found my noodles to be a little bit too hard/undercooked, (probably because they were prepared so quickly) but I just soaked them a little longer in my soup and then they were okay.

Overall: Definitely can't beat the price, and great if you just want to grab a (super) quick, no frills meal. It's kind of cafeteria-style in the sense that you can go and grab your own water/tea (free of charge) at this little kitchenette thing they have, and then you pay at the counter when you are done your meal.

The restaurant is bright and airy and always clean. The staff are circulating all the time, cleaning tables and removing empty dishes. 

This is a restaurant where you order and pay at the counter before you receive your food. They give you a pager so that you can pick your food up at the counter when it's ready, but most of the time they deliver it right to the table.

There's a great variety of sandwiches, soups, salads and pizzas. You can also order 2 halves of any of the choices (other than pizza). The prices are reasonable, but I wouldn't say it's inexpensive. For a half soup and salad or sandwich for lunch, it's usually around $12 or so. I love that they offer gluten-free bread, but the extra $3 they charge for that option makes a lunch there quite expensive. They have a fairly large beverage menu with cappuccinos, lattes, hot chocolate, coffee, tea and several cold drinks including a pop fountain.

The offerings are bit more 'gourmet' than somewhere like Panera. They have delicious salads with fruit, nuts, seeds, etc... Sandwich offerings also include panini. The gluten-free pizza is very good, with a nice crisp crust.

It's not your typical ruckus of getting there 30 minutes early to get a good seat, drape jackets over the seats while one person stays behind to watch, and wait to order your junk food in the lobby as you stare at your watch waiting for the line to move and the movie to start.  All while you're hoping to hit the bathroom before the movie so you don't have to ask 800 people to get up and let you by.

SMG just crushes all those experiences.  I went on a Tuesday night, which was $5 movie night (YEAH!!!).  Theater wasn't crowded at all and I had a full pick of seats.  You walk up to the counter, choose your movie and a seat map shows up so you can pick where you want to sit.  It's great, so you don't have to feel the pressure of getting to the theater early to save seats.

Once I sat down, I had a menu where I could pretty much choose whatever I wanted for dinner.  I ended up splitting a ""dinner for two"" style menu with a friend.  We had one app to share, two entrees, and a dessert for an extra $5.  I also had a glass of wine that was on special (and was pretty good, too!).  I got a southwestern salad with chicken that was actually delicious.  I was shocked because it was movie theater food, but it's not some nasty salad that was sitting in refrigerated case.  If you do save room for dessert, definitely get the brownie.

Although the movie I saw was terrible, the experience in the theater was great.  I don't know if this place is different during busier times, but they were quick when the theater wasn't crowded!

If you do not drink coffee for breakfast, that may be OK with you. The coffee served looked as light as tea and tasted like water.

A smaller coffee carafe was brought to us and it was a little more decent yet still watered down. The waiter actually said that we should order espressos which would cost a little more but would be better coffee. We ended up going to Starbucks after for real coffee.

For those times when you want to bring the whole family out to a movie, you really can't beat what WestWind Drive-In Las Vegas 5 has to offer.

Located just north of Fiesta Rancho and right next to the NLV Airport (expect a plane or two to land or take off while you're at the movie), it does suffer a little because of the neon signs.  While watching ""Kung-Fu Panda"" tonight, many of the dark scenes were quite difficult to see.  Other than that, you can see the screen's just fine.  The audio quality is based on an FM station that you tune into in your car.  My radio always has some scratchiness to it (I've also heard it in other cars), but more often than not you can hear the movie from the other cars around you without much strain.

The cost is $6.25 per adult, $1.00 for each child over 5 and Free for those under 5.  On Tuesday's the cost is $4.50.  Each show is a double-feature, so in our case tonight we had KFP and IronMan.  Concessions offer anything you want but just bring in all the food you desire in your trunk and enjoy a picnic on or around your car while you wait for the movie to start.

It opens up an hour before the earliest showtime (usually shows start at dusk around 7 or 8 depending on time of the year); I'd recommend showing up 30-45 minutes early to get a good spot so you have room to relax.  Bring chairs and blankets and make a tailgate out of the show.  If I can say anything more, having all of this room to relax while watching the movie is one huge plus over a regular theater.

It's a very kid-friendly place as well. The floors are sealed concrete and the tables and chairs are indestructible, so there's really nothing so delicate they can mess up. When we went mid-day on a Saturday, the place was full of families with strollers.

One half is food ""stalls"" which have everything you could think of, from paninis to sushi to crepes to soup to pizza. We went to the sandwich place and got awesome fresh made-to-order sandwiches with sides of house made pickles or hand cut chips. It was the perfect snack before heading into the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center.

On the other half of the floor is a market with jars of local canned goods and honeys and soaps and pretty much everything you'd want at a natural, local market, including wine! There are definitely items here that grabby little hands could break, so best to keep the little ones in the stroller in this section. (At least if they are as accident prone as I was as a child.)

The waiter brought us the rib-eye sauce to go with it  It was delicious.  The spinach and cheese tomatoes were very average. I had the crab cake which was very good and fresh with a lovely sauce.  We had the blue nut salad and scallops potatoes as well and both were very good. For dessert we got the bananas foster and the chocolate lava cake. The bananas foster was awesome, but the lava cake was dry and we would not order it again.  

Our booth was lovely, but we felt the music was too loud and not appropriate for the romantic atmosphere. It was top 40 pop ( which I love), but not for a romantic dinner.    Also, my husband's birthday was not acknowledged and I told them about it twice when I I made the reservation and when I confirmed it.   Our service was wonderful in the beginning, but as the restaurant got busier, our service wained and we sat for over 30 minutes once we finished our dessert.

The Happy Hour Menu is 7 days a week from 3pm to 7pm, and has $2 tacos! Hello!! It doesn't even have to be Taco Tuesday to get $2 tacos! Oh sweet!

This review is for the few times I have been.

Ordered the Elote Esquite for starters, its Mexican street style corn off the cob with ancho peppers and cotija cheese seared on cast iron skillet, it also comes with chips & a trio of salsa. This elote corn dip was delish and gone before we knew it, can't wait to go back for more!

The Tacos! They are like street tacos  and have homemade taco shells and I have tried the following:

The taco special was a pork belly with habanero mango, to me, this was one was ok; I was expecting more of a sweet kick with it being habanero mango, so it was little on the mild side.

Had a fish taco and its Tecate beer battered white fish and it was a pretty tasty taco

Of course I had to have a carne asada taco, it's a chimichurri ribeye steak, and this too was a good tasting taco! Yum!

My favorite taco, which surprised me was the veggie taco, it has a sweet potato mash as the base and seasonal veggies, this time it was onions & mushrooms, so delsih! I need to order more soon!

The veal sandwich is outstanding. Can't count the number of veal slices with hot and sweet (this would be the 'medium' heat) peppers on a kaiser. Smothered in tomato sauce, the kaiser barely holds the food in as it's dripping from all ends.

The grilled chicken, also same style but with non-breaded chicken breast. It's grilled with a good smoky flavor and again the kaiser can't hold the heaps of meat, peppers and sauce.

For $7.50 a sandwich it's a great lunch, and will fill you. I was already full after half, but i motored on cause it was worth it.

Only thing, you gotta find parking around it is in Toronto, some side streets do have free parking for an hr. If they got a few orders, does take a while. And, it's a bit cramped, but that's ok, once I finish i'm outta there.

PUMPKIN-MUSSEL SOUP: WHAT IS THE RECIPE? Dang this was delicious. I practically licked the plate clean.. (loved the chives!) It was a perfect, light appetizer, getting my taste buds excited for what the 2nd course would be like.
SMOKED PORK KIELBASA: In my opinion, I thought that the sauerkraut didn't need to be there, but that's just personal as sauerkraut just isn't my thing. The kielbasa was very tasty! It was complimented well with the crushed potatoes and turnips although with those 2 looking quite similar in color, I was confused at first when I took a bite into the crunchy turnip. Haha. Presentation wasn't the key really here, as everything kind of had the same color scheme. My date's Bluefish dish looked better than mine..
CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE: I was so looking forward to this but was unfortunately disappointed. Dessert was supposed to be the banger of the meal to leave me feeling really good, but that wasn't the case here. I had expectations of the cake being sweet and decadent, but it had a very dark chocolate kind of taste. The whipped cream didn't look so tasty on top either. Ahh..

SERVICE: On point. Upon walking in, we had a reservation set for 7:45PM and we were seated right away (at a 4 person table although there were only 2 of us, not complaining but just thought it was funny). They were timely about refilling our waters and asking if our meal was okay.

ATMOSPHERE: Comfortable and casual yet still upscale. Dark but not Cheesecake Factory dark and still romantic. Little candle and small dried flower centerpieces. Can definitely hold a conversation fine here, as it isn't too loud or too quiet.

Overall, the experience of Legume was really nice. If I'm looking to splurge and not make the trip to downtown, Legume here I come. It's very likely the only time I'd come back is for the Cheap Date Night, because it's a deal I can't pass up.",2017-10-06 04:25:23

We came here on a Saturday night just before closing and fortunately, they still accommodated us despite somewhat of a mini-rush to get the last call in. 

It really is fusion in the sense that they do things a bit differently here. There's kimchi with your popcorn chicken, there's a sweet creamy sauce in the meat floss pancake, there's Japanese items on the menu. But all of this is for the better, because everything oddly works. 

The meat floss pancake was surprisingly melt in your mouth. The popcorn chicken was flavorful with the five spices. There aromatics with sweetness, and it was breaded with a crunch. You'd expect this to be dry with the rice but there's some meat and sauce over the rice to keep things flavorful and moist. I actually loved the kimchi here, it's on the sweeter spectrum too and the fishcakes and fried tofu were nice sides to the bento. It's a great bento meal.

The dry chili noodles were a myriad of things. I liked the spiciness of it; it surprisingly packed a lot of heat. The pickled vegetables added a nice sweetness and saltiness to it. The only thing I'd say it was very 'wet' and it made for some weird textures but otherwise it was still very tasty.",2018-02-25 21:01:18
vTYAAWxllceBecDKIngCrA,LTnCcTKbS-SBQlFGJ5Jm7g,k6xdowEVuVayawlVr7reyw,5,2,0,0,"** Please make sure you check out the filtered reviews about Jyuban Raman House!!

Overview: Owner and chef is Chinese, BUT he trained under a Japanese Ramen master.
I've been to the Big 3 downtown (Sansotei, Santouka, Kinton) but NONE of them make their pork belly or eggs like Jyuban. Jyuban broth is clearer and simmered for hours (NO POWDER), and ramen is not packaged.

Location: Tucked inside the Commerce Gate plaza, Jyuban has a lot of competition with the nearby Korean Grill, Hot Pot, and various other BBT joints. Parking is ALWAYS an issue at this plaza. I opt for underground and back parking if I can't find something right away. Access to this restaurant is via inside the little mall only.

Facility: Slightly out of date and kind of kitschy, there is marker writing on the wall (I'm fairly those are intentional), which offer a cozy feeling. Ceilings are high though, so everything you say, every time your chair moves, it echoes. Washrooms are not the best, typical of a lower quality asian restaurant. This place needs to update their decor. There is a random giant fish tank as soon as you walk in. It serves ZERO purpose, it looks hideous... there are fake fish suspended inside.

Food Quality & Price: What completely makes up for their decor, is the quality of their ramen. Reviews of Jyuban complain about the food quality, but in my opinion those people have no idea what good ramen is supposed to be like in the first place. People are so accustomed to eating fake, powdered, instant ramen with heaps and heaps of toppings, MSG and preservatives, they forget (and are completely ignorant to) what quality ramen should look and taste like. 

Jyuban's ramen sifu (master) has trained for years under his own Japanese ramen master and refuses to ever put MSG in his dishes. The result is a light and clean tasting broth (what you REALLY want for your ramen). For those with a more sensitive palette, you can taste that the pork bone soup is real (not made from powder) and has been simmering for hours. Ramen is freshly made IN HOUSE by the ramen master. 

Noodles come in three types, your usual egg noodle, spinach noodle (green) and squid-ink noodle (black). For those who are used to having other ramen houses, stick to the egg noodles until you feel that your tongue is sensitive enough to takes the undertones of the other two noodles. They are VERY subtle and may not make a big difference to you (but they cost extra). Spicy ramen is VERY spicy for the typical patron. Order a Level 1, that is usually more than enough for most people. I order Level 2 and I am comfortable, but I am a spice fiend, so do not use me as a spice gauge. My entire family has their nose running, brows sweating and eyes watering at Level 1. Egg is marinated cooked to perfection - solid but slightly yolky (not your simple white boiled egg as seen in other ramen houses). The only catch is that the beef is hit-n-miss, BUT the pork belly is to die for! Anything with pork belly will not let you down!!

Ramen dishes here are slightly pricier than the average, but understandable if you can appreciate the purity of the craft. All this said, I do not really like the appetizers. Desert is also okay. If you come to Jyuban, you come for the ramen.

Service: There is always one woman there (owner's wife, I believe) when we go and she always recognizes us and knows what we order. She is attentive and efficient. They had recently hired a young girl to help with service. She is okay. I don't like the new rewards card - it used to be one bowl = one stamp, then 10 stamps get you 3 free bowls (that was great). Now it's every $10 spent = 1 stamp, then 6 stamps gets you 10% off (terrible deal, might as well not have this at all).

Overall: Jyuban is a quiet restaurant and I am glad that the owner/cook does not compromise his authenticity despite some poor reviews. People really do not know what good quality ramen looks or tastes like. He is not Japanese but his master is, so in my opinion, the ramen is authentic. Points to improve on - their location needs to update their decor and ambiance, take a look at the quality of their appetizers, get rid of/get better rewards program, and increase the portion of their ramen by just a little. Jyuban scores a 4.5/5 overall rounded up to 5 to balance out the incredibly poor reviews people have previously written.",2014-07-19 03:34:51

I've heard a few regular Vegas visitors rave about them. So I was on a quest to find out just how special they could possibly be. 

Located inside the new and hip Cosmopolitan, Holstein's contains a bar area as well as a fair amount of table seating. Grabbing a quick lunch before a meeting, I headed towards a bar space where I noticed the server cleaning up after someone who had just left. After I sat down, another server came up to me and said ""Oh no, sir, there's someone sitting there and he'll be right back.""

Looking at the clear space, I asked ""Then why did they just clear all his stuff away?""

Before he could answer, I moved farther down the bar and picked another spot. During the rest of my visit, that ""man"" never came back to his ""spot."" No apologies or anything. So that was a little rude.  

I spied the rolls on the menu and ordered them. When they arrived I knew right away that these were not your average spring rolls. They were quite large. And very good, too. Just picture the best Philly cheese steak you ever had all wrapped up into a perfectly fried spring roll. Then triple that in size. Now you have it. 

They were outstanding and I'll be back again someday for more. They are also very filling, even though they're on the appetizer menu. So you could easily make this a meal. 

This place has a little to learn about customer service, but the food lives up to expectations. And after you're done, step outside to your left and get your shoes shined. It's totally worth it. Just trust me.",2012-04-08 15:21:30

We also ordered the beef stroganoff, which was rich and filling. The short ribs melted in my mouth, and I would certainly order it again.

I had heard this place was the best but we could only get in at 530. The place was fairly empty when we went but got a hard time initially about switching to a more comfortable table/booth. The service was terrible. Our waitress didnt smile once or ask how we were. i felt like she did not even know the menu. It was straight cut to the chase, no friendly service at all. I tried to joke around a bit to lighten her mood but she just stared at me with a deer in the headlights look.

The food was good, no complaints there really but i felt uncomfortable and unwelcome because of the waitress. On our way out the door there were 4 hostesses standing at the front and they stared at us as we left like judging us or something, not one said good bye. Really awkward experience. I will never be back. If I am going to spend that kind of $ I will go somewhere more welcoming. We are well dressed (suit/dresses) and always tip at least 20% if not more.

It's a very open and spacious layout, and having the large glass windows letting in daylight is a huge plus. It's usually not too busy here during the day, which I like. It gets a little busier at night, but I've always been able to find a table. I've tried their iced caf√© latte, iced matcha milk tea, iced sesame milk tea, and green tea crepe cake. I've liked the matcha and sesame milk teas, but the latte wasn't really anything out of the ordinary. Because the matcha is powder based, it is a bit grainy as you drink it, and same with the sesame too with a bit more sweetness. Their green tea crepe cake was okay. If you've ever had Lady M's crepe cake, you'll think this one doesn't quite come close. The flavor isn't too bad, but more so the texture is a bit off. The crepe part of the cake has a hint of almost a playdoh texture...and just the green color of it isn't so much a matcha green, but a pine green food coloring. I probably wouldn't get the green tea crepe cake again, but am willing to try other desserts on the menu.

It comes stuffed with marinated steak, kimchi, asadero cheese, chili aioli & kalbi glaze. Luckily it tastes as good as it sounds. It is good for 2 to 4 people. The flavors are great. You can taste each of the ingredients and they all bring something good it.

For my meal I chose the Nom Nom Burger. It comes with Kobe Beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips and 1000 island dressing. That list tells you everything you need to know about why I ordered it. The burger is large and filling. I was unable to finish it off. That being said, it was quite tasty. You get all the great flavors from the ingredients plus the added texture of the potato chips. The burgers also come with fries. The fries are good. They have good flavor and are the right amount of crisp.

We had to try the Bam-Boozled Shakes as well. Neither of us needed the additional food, but they sounded so good. I ordered the Red Velvet Cake Shake. It comes mixed with Zing Red Velvet Vodka, red velvet cake, cream cheese mousse and a mini whoopee pie. Yep, it was good. You get all the great flavor of red velvet with a little booze mixed in. The portion is large. It is a meal unto its self.

This is a good lunch or casual dinner spot. You could also stop in for a shake at any time. It is worth it.",2015-05-02 15:15:55

I am not sure how the portion size compares to the regular bowl that you might get, but it's not a bad portion as I'm satisfied with the meal.

The restaurant is clean, though they only have high seats.
Washrooms are in the basement.

When you're there to pick up your order, they will then pack the soup so that it is still hot, as opposed to some other places that might just leave your order sitting around. This is important because if you're getting the beef pho, they include a pack of raw beef. Also, cool soup is not cool.

I've tried their beef, brisket, and chicken pho and they've all been pretty good. I prefer the brisket a bit more because it feels like they give more meat there, but the chicken is alright as well.

They use some sort of small sprout which is different from the ones you'd usually find, which is an interesting twist. They are less crunchy than their thick long counterparts, and taste somewhat bitter. So if you like that extra crunch from sprouts in your pho, this might not work for you. But it doesn't really matter to me. Two different types of sprouts are offered: fenugreek sprouts, and red clover sprouts.

Their soup is not too heavy, not too oily. Flavour is pretty light; might need to add some extra sauce if you want the extra flavour.

If you're on mealpal, definitely an option to consider since the regular prices are 12+",2017-07-12 17:29:38

And besides, no good sport is going on during the summer months to entertain you other than pool parties. One can only sport a bronzed tan for so long. 

Staff is always sweet and attentive. The remodel definitely makes this spot more appealing. They replaced the 70s plastic chairs with red vibrant lounge loveseats and better computer screens. I love how it gives you the breakdown of each game, your speed and how you scored, ie gutterballs versus strikes. Food is not bad, but typical bar food. And plenty of TV screens in the bar area to catch any sports while you are getting your competitive nature on. Great for group outings, family time or date nights. You always meet friendly and easygoing people. Evenings and weekends were so much fun with the dance music and disco lights spotlighting my lovely PBA skills. 

With that all said, the new pricing, whether to offset the remodel costs or not, is a serious ding in your wallet. No longer are the days of $13 for two hours of bowling, including shoes and ball. My bestie and I left after two hours, a pitcher of beer with a tab over $75. OUCH!!! It has certainly changed their attraction from being pretty packed on evenings to open lanes galore.

While we were thinking about it we put our names on the list, there were 3 other 2 tops ahead of us.  One of them had left I guess so we were sat in about 10 minutes.  I'm glad we stayed.  

We were sat at the bar, with a perfect view of the noodles flinging about the kitchen.  Although I am a little short so I was standing most of the time :)  The place is small, probably no more than 24 seats, 10 of which are at the bar.  The service is quick and friendly.  The noodles come out quickly and it is fun to watch your order being made.  I got the Soy Ramen with extra scallions and extra pork.  Get the extra pork.  Each bowl comes with like 2 thin slices of pork.  It was my favorite part of the bowl, it is braised fatty pork that kind of melts in your soup and your mouth.  The flavor is wonderful and noodles are tender and slurpable (is that  a word?).  

It was 20 bucks without tip and included two beers and two bowls.  It was quick and fun and tasty.  In the past I have had ramen bowls that were tasty, but they usually come with fish cakes and a few other things I don't love.  But this was pretty straight forward and no fish in any of these.

Finally I got my wish this past weekend and we headed to Prohibition. There were some great things about this place and some sorta not ok things about the place. 

First of all, I can have fun dancing pretty much anywhere. If I hear music, my body just has an involuntary twitch to it that makes me dance. It's really not my choice, it just happens. Grocery store, in the car, Mc Donalds, Petsmart, Dentist... it doesn't matter. My toes start a tappin and then the rest of me just follows. Life is much more fun that way, and you make new friends in the oddest of places...
 
But back to Prohibition. Ok, number one I had on heels, and this place is upstairs. I'm not out of shape, but I didn't go out for the stair climbing... Once I bounded up the stairs in my lovely heels, I trotted off to the dance floor. They have a pretty cool outside patio once you get to the top of the stairs too, but my blinders were set and I was in shake my booty mode. 

There weren't many people dancing but I headed out there anyways and tried to make due. 2 other ladies hit the floor after that and then it was like a meat market... holy crap. I was afraid, so I backed off the dance floor and danced by our table instead. We got a couple drinks, had a good time, and they played songs from when I used to go out all the time. Maybe I'm old, but I loved that! However, I noticed the demographic didn't really match the music as there were plenty of young un's running around. Half of them were probably in elementary school when, ""I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"" was wailing through the club in my hey day. 

It was fine when we first got there, but around 11 or so it got packed. Like sardine packed and I started feeling claustrophobic. We all headed out to the deck where you could still hear the music, so my booty shakin commenced. But, we were thwarted once again when more people showed up and piled in the place. 

We were there for about 2 hours or less and I had a great time, but it's just a small place with lots of young people. I started feeling out of place as it got later. I'd probably go back, but I'd like to find some better options for someone, ""My Age."" Sigh.",2012-08-21 18:15:42

It was deep fried on spicy coleslaw. The guacamole was definitely not what we expected. In fact, we thought we got the wrong item brought to us lol. After using my phone to pull up the menu we realized it was what we ordered. I expected traditional guacamole (green for example) topped with cheese. To our surprise it was more of a hummus. Still good though. Weird that there wasn't bruschetta or a garlic bread option.

I admit, my experience is biased and probably not what most people would agree with.

I liked the plot and thought it was a cute idea, but when I go to see a Cirque Show, I just want to see the acrobatics, not sit through long drawn out ""acting"" sessions where nothing amazing is happening.  Basically, just take me to the circus and spare me the storyline.

Overall, it was good.  I wouldn't go see it again, though.  Stage theatrics were elaborate and impressive, I'll admit. The music was entertaining as well.

But it didn't disappoint! Food quality was great, definitely recommend getting the hot items like teriyaki and grilled. Takoyaki was awesome and their tempura was well executed as well. Fish tastes fresh, and the atmosphere was chic.

They don't serve plain sashimi at lunch...which means you'll have to get sushi aka a ball of rice if you want to eat sashimi. Also, they missed quite a few items despite ordering them a second time. Ended up telling the servers so they could bring the items we were missing.

Well, I got a bit of a shocker today - I went to Banjara for dinner tonight and I thought that it was going to be bad - as I had bad experiences at its previous incarnations as Mr. Maharaja (on Balmuto) and Banjara when it was at Yonge and Charles - but, I was proven incorrect!

The food was quite tasty!

I was with five others and we had a good array of dishes. I tried the Panner Tikka (a little crispy, tangy and done just right!), Aloo Ghobi (which had some curry leaves in it - so be careful), Chana Masala (not bad) Baingan Bharta (a great Panjabi dish) and Palak Paneer (not the best I had, but very good).

The patio, even though in front of the restaurant on the sidewalk, is quite quiet and comfortable as this restaurant is on a one way street with only a few other restaurants. Adjacent to the Flying Fig's patio, this one has some park bench seating with pillow cushions.   

Market Ave doesn't have a large entree section on their menu, but they have a decent selection of really good tapas and surprising to me a large pizza menu. The pizzas are very Italian in my mind based on the topping options. I got mine with Basel ($.50), olives ($.5) and salami ($1)! Such great flavor! The pizzas are quite carb heavy though as they're served on French bread. But it's so good and flakey. The presentation is neat too - served on a thick slab paddle shaped wooden cutting board. 

The appetizer/tapas that's my favorite was the small red stuffed peppers. Served cold. Amazing flavor! I would say the serving is only enough for one though.

I grew up liking the Packers but being from Michigan I've also been laughing at the Detroit team for many, many years.  I feel for you guys.  Having a bad team for lengthy periods of time SUCKS.

I will have to say though given a couple factors such as tailgating experiences, the fans, the dawg pound, stadium location, and overall ambiance of 'Going to a Browns Game', it kinda rocks.  Really!!  I've never had a disappointing time.  Tickets aren't overly expensive and the stadium itself has held up over the years.

Now I'm not going to comment on bathrooms, food, beer, etc. because I've really seen consistent service at most professional stadiums / ballparks, Browns are no different.  I will comment that if you are coming to a game and the group your with will allow for it, you have to either set-up at the Muni or at least park somewhere and take a walk through.  The people watching is fantastic and the fans themselves are truly considerate, drunk...um..sure...fun drunk, but still super nice.  I mean this with the utmost level of competitive testosterone.

Almost all dishes are around $8 range and quite affordable with decent portions.  You can order extra noodles for just over a buck more and is worth it if you hungry.

The beef shang noodles hand cut was the best dish we had for the night.  The beef was extremely tender and the broth had a very deep beef flavor.  The hand cut noodles was more evenly cut than I thought, so we'll try the knife cut it next.  Noodles were cooked perfectly.

The spicy won tun appetizer was a bit too sweet and not much of a spicy flavor.  This was so so.

The dan dan noodles again was a bit too sweet and wasn't much of a spicy flavor.  Their version doesn't have a peanut component.

Our menu was set as we were a group of 30-or more, that included the Garden Vegetable Salad, Corn fed Filet Mignon, handmade Forest Mushroom Lasagna and a Sherry Braised Mary's half chicken. and for Dessert, we all had Creme Brulee.

Let me start by saying that Service at the event was exceptional, the servers were on top of things and we were well taken care of.

Salad came out, and it was tasty, nothing over the top but and lacked a little bit more haloumi cheese. The creme brulee was good a swell, and i liked the small cookie surprise with some citric fruit (i think it was mandarin) on the side of the plate. 

As for my main dish, I ordered the mushroom lasagna and this dish looked a little strange at first, definitely not your typical lasagna. Layers of dough not in an orderly fashion put on top of one another and the whole dish had loads of different types of mushroom. It probably was 3-5 different mushroom flavors that hit my palate. It was filling, tasty and out of this world. the little spinach bed under the dish was great as well. 

Overall, the experience and service get top points, The Lasagna gets top points as well, desert and salad were great sating but nothing exceptional or surprising.

Many of the staff were here when it was open under a different name so we were happy they remained with the new owners. I come here with just my daughter often and have also been with a group and we have always been well taken care of. 

The place is always clean throughout. The dining room, restrooms and the kitchen, which you can see into from the dining area. I appreciate that the a/c is nice and cool in the summer to keep everyone comfortable. 

The d√©cor is simple, money has not been wasted here. There is Indian music playing in the background, which adds nicely to the ambience. I like that I'm not overwhelmed with TV's hanging from the ceiling blaring distracting videos while I'm trying to eat. 

Since the new owners took over this restaurant the food went from okay to amazing! It has a touch more spice to it than before and there are several new items on the menu, of which my favorite is the Mayuri Special Veg Thali. If I eat here for dinner I order this because it comes with several different items to enjoy: sambar, rasam, 3 South Indian curries, 2 North Indian curries, rice, pickle, pappadum, yoghurt dessert and bread. The pickle stuff is a little too sour for my taste buds, but I love everything else.  My daughter's favorite dish here is the Paneer Butter Masala... and I agree that it is extremely delicious.

Last night we ordered appetizers that we had not previously tried and I would definitely recommend them. My husband and friends loved the Chicken 65, which is boneless chicken cubes marinated in South Indian style spices and deep fried. There were fresh sliced jalapeno peppers throughout adding to the spiciness of this dish. My daughter and I (vegetarians) had the Chilli Paneer appetizer, which is pan fried spicy indian cottage cheese cubes. I promise, it's much better than it sounds! There are perfectly cooked, delicious chunks of onions and bell peppers marinated in sauce mixed in with the fried cheese cubes. And what's not to love about friend cheese?

I still prefer to eat here for the lunch buffet because I enjoy tasting ALL the vegan and vegetarian dishes. They have a great assortment of items out at any given time, both vegan and non-vegatarian. It's perfectly fine with me that they now charge what the other 2 Indian restaurants a block away are charging for their lunch buffet because it's about all about quality. You can't have the best quality food at prices that don't pay to keep the doors open. I am happy to pay a couple dollars more for great food. 

I am not a desert eater and Indian deserts are no exception. I have tasted several at numerous Indian restaurants and I just don't care for them; they're too sweet, greasy and very heavy. I'm more of a fresh-piece-off-fruit-girl if ever I have a need for something sweet, but that's my personal preference.

The fried bananas were just breaded bananas that were fried not the plantains I was hoping for. Pastas and bean dishes are offered to fill up diners. 

The six meats that were offered consisted of bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, ham with pineapple, spicy chicken, BBQ chicken, pork, and sirloin. The latter were the best items. The beef was cooked to a nice medium rare and juicy. The pork was flavorful and possessed a nice spice rub. The pineapple was something my friend and I wished came around more frequently then once.

We started out with the calamari and Caesar salad, both of which were above average.  Similar to my experience at SW, a really tasty bread basket was brought to the table.

I ordered the lasagna, but requested to hold the pine nuts, the server said that unfortunately they are inside of the lasagna and cannot be removed.  I found this kind of strange, but I understand perhaps this dish is mass produced so I lived with it.

The lasagna was good and better than what I have had at Chicago Joe's or The M, but I would expect that for $10+ more!  It uninformatively wasn't worth the price and quality that I've had at other higher end Italian restaurants.  I did pull out a few pieces of hard fat/meat which is understandable because it wasn't ground beef, but obviously isn't a highlight of the meal.

Overall the setting is very nice, but I wish I could have spent that money at a higher-end experience.  For a measuring stick, I had a much better meal at Bootlegger Bistro with just a slightly more casual atmosphere for a lower price.",2013-05-16 00:13:50

.............................

Dear Sean,

We're sorry to hear you aren't as enthusiastic about Bookmans as we are. We base our purchases and pricing on the basic principles of supply and demand.  Unfortunately, this means that we aren't able to take everything people bring to us and our offers reflect the desirability of the items we do take. While we'd love to have you shop with us, perhaps another retailer may better suit your needs. It takes all sorts of businesses to create a healthy local economy.  Best of luck and have a good day.

Sincerely,
Katie Downing
Store Manager
Bookmans Phoenix location

Notice how Katie calls me stupid, as if I don't understand the principles of supply and demand.  Tell me Katie, do you understand the principles of vulture capitalism?  Here's a little hint, if I've reviewed a business with a 1-star review, it should be assumed that I am already choosing another retailer that DOES suit my needs.

Prices are very reasonable and night time cosmic bowling is really fun - last time I went, I was happy to see Kevin Bacon dancing on screen as ""Footloose"" blasted through the speakers. My favorite thing about this place is the food court - sizable portions of all your junk food needs, such as Nachos, Hot Dogs, Chili Cheese Fries. Of course, i got a stomachache afterwards, but I'd like to think it was worth it. Workers are quick to address issues (we requested a lane change since the next party to us was frequently crossing into our lanes), but I do wish some of the parents kept a better eye on their kids - saw kids on top of the machines, parents encouraging their kids to bowl at the same time as others, and just overall chaos.",2013-12-10 21:14:02

I also used the service department so I will break the review down into two parts. 

Sales:
As many of the negative reviews have even said this was pretty easy and much less hassle than other dealerships. Found a 2008 mustang I was interested in at west sahara location which I live closer to but didn't appreciate their salesman pressure and sending me a letter in the mail to come back and see him which I never authorized my mailing address to be solicited but anyways I contacted this location and spoke with Lorenzo (my salesman would definetly recommend) who within a couple days got it over to henderson location. The process from here was very quick and simple test drove it loved it put my credit app on got approved and was ready to go within a couple hours. I liked dealing with my one salesman the entire process he was polite professional and showed me on his screen every single step of the process. It was nice not dealing with the hassle and hours of work dealerships can be. Had no pressure and they made me feel comfortable car is great had it about a month now and put close to 3000 miles on it.

Service:

Reading other reviews I was very worried about what I would have to deal with when I needed to make an appointment to have a couple things (minor) checked out within my 30 day warranty. While it wasn't perfect it was much better than I had anticipated. A couple door trims loose inside car 2 of them were able to be reattached. Front brakes were making some noise. I was ready to get the ""they are within carmax standard"" response which I did get but they said they were still going to replace the front brake pads and resurface rotors. It took a whole day and I needed to go to work they told me I wasn't getting a loaner at first had to fight for a bit on that one but they caved in and gave me one. Jason and brent(manager) treated me well and kept me informed during the two occaison I had it in fit service.

I recommend, unless you are REALLY hungry - start with the little sandwich (I like to call them ""tortita"" - don't quote me - that's my expression and the waiter will NOT understand you).

But my husband and I always get tacos.  He orders Tacos de Alhambra de Res - strip steak with chopped ham and bacon (I think).  I order a cheese quesadilla de maiz (Maiz instead of flour - much better!).  The quesadilla is served with a  green chile salsa sauce inside - spicy - but not to make your eyes water.  You can get quesadillas stuffed with other fillings too.

They have different flavor Horchata's as well  (I love to say Orrrrrrr -CHA-ta).

I'll tell you what....my mom is from Mexico City.  She says that the tacos are like what you can buy on the streets in Mexico (which is a good thing).  I think you should take a chance and trust my mom on this.

This place is not overpriced, in fact, it's very reasonable for the quality of food that you get.  Classy does not = $$$ and that's why I love this place!

Lunch Buffet - $9.99, more than a dozen options, including fresh naan that comes to your table, about half of the options are veggie, salads, and for desserts there's fresh fruit, rice pudding, & gulab jamun (honey timbit thing).  Choices/quality are actually quite impressive, including goat vindaloo, tandoori chicken (not dry at all!), samosas/onion bhajis.  

No nasty skin atop of the gravies, no Saran Wrap, no massive heat lamp dependency, & no riffled over, empty trays that are in desperate need of refilling!  Glasses of water are refilled without asking and dirty dishes are cleared off, ASAP.

No buffet at dinner, but entr√©es aren't expensive at around $10/ea.

We asked for an additional seat at the high top tables and the ""manager"" of the Month informs me chairs can't be moved from the bar area because it takes away from the bartender. So out of the 8 empty chairs at the bar, you cannot spare one to move 2.5 ft away so we can all sit at a table instead of scattered all over the bar.  Ok your wish is my command. We won't be wasting a penny at a restaurant charging big $ but run by managers who have had frontal lobotomies. Yes we must pay $30 for a order of pseudo fresh tuna but will not move a chair for the customer.  Managers here have no brain and must follow rules that make no sense. Well we left and I hope the bartender makes a lot of $ wiping glasses and chatting with his empty bar chairs. I'll spend my $200 somewhere else.

Came here for a couple drinks after work, and was left wondering why I had never been here for drinks before.

G&Ts being my go to drink, I was naturally ecstatic to be able to choose from 10+ gins, 3 types of soda, and even your preferred style of ice. Served with a side dish of cucumber slices and  hibiscus petals, it was definitely a gin and tonic that will put all others to a higher benchmark.

I met up with friends on a Saturday night around 9pm.  You'd think things would be poppin' off..  Nope!  The place was empty.  Granted, the Life is Beautiful festival was going on downtown and any shows at the Stratosphere were probably still going on as well.  I'm guessing after the shows get out and during their happy hours, the place is a lot more crowded.  Being that our server only had one table, our service was great!  Not a great selection of beer and while their flavored martini's were tasty, they were weak.  I like my Cosmopolitan to have a little bite... don't we all?  Especially at $15.00 a glass.  Super overpriced.  In addition to the restaurant on the 106th level (which I've eaten at) I feel they need to make some adjustments to bring in a younger more vibrant crowd.  

The view is awesome and there are plenty of little tables with lounge couches to choose from all over the circular lounge.   You can't cheat a glass of wine, so I would stick with that.  They had a nice selection.

It took our servers so long to get us water refills.. We were getting pretty dehydrated out there.

We ordered the ribeye, with mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes for $28. Along with a shock top beer that was surprising $10.. What beer cost $10?!

So total our bill was $43 plus tip, which makes it over $50.

In my opinion, that was not what we expected to pay.

The worst part about our experience was that there were speakers on the ceiling and it kept playing spurts of LOUD music that was literally blowing everyone's ear drums out. It wasn't like it was good music either. It was scratchy and just out of tune. Everyone's faces looked unpleasant.

You can reserve your exact seats in advance. I love this because i hate having to worry that I won't get good seats and having to show up early to make sure I get them.

You can order drinks or food right at your seat.

This place was already packed when we arrived at 6pm on a Saturday. We ordered the crispy beef to start. Then we have the signature 2 course Peking Duck. The skin is crispy and the meat is not greasy. It comes with the green onion, cucumber, and also Chinese style crepe. The second course was minced with vegetables served with lettuce cups. It has an excellent savoury flavoured minced duck meat mixture balanced out with the refreshing lettuce Wrap. One whole duck easily serves 4 people. It is arguably the the best Peking Duck in the Toronto! We also order the Lamb Soup Pot. It is a perfect soup for cold winters in Toronto to nourish your body. To end with, the taro sweet soup is a true delight. If you are planning to come during weekend, be sure you make a reservation.",2015-12-10 05:10:53

That's pretty incredible!  I have never had a facial before so I had no idea what to expect out of this experience.  I am somewhat particular about my brows so I was a bit nervous, but then again I haven't found anyone in the valley that I like yet so may as well!

My services were with Brandi and she was awesome!  She was very friendly and professional so I felt completely comfortable throughout the entire time.  For my brows she talked to me about what I wanted them to look like and showed exactly where she was going to remove the hair before even starting - NICE!  I love how they came out and was overall happy with them!

As far as the facial she does arm/hand massage while the masks are hardening.  It was super relaxing and the place was clean and quiet.  The best part was at the end I was asking about setting up facials on a monthly basis and she made me aware that if I were to do so for the next SIX times I went I would receive the same pricing! :-o

This time I ordered the black tan tan and my friend got the spicy miso. The black tan tan broth was very different and I enjoyed it. It tastes really creamy and nutty. It's not your usual ramen broth! It is very unique. Adding the additional sesame makes the broth more bold. I tried my friends spicy miso and I loved that broth even more. It wasn't thick or oily. Very creamy and it had a bold flavor. I love the broth here. For the meat, I wished they more generous with it. I feel like the ramen lacks in toppings.

The Institute is located in a nice building and wasn't as crowded as what I've experienced in NYC. I guess that's the beauty of a smaller town / the suburbs. 

Same routine: Before you start your facial, the esthetician will ask you to choose the an oil of the 3 that you prefer... I always go for the tangerine scent. Frankly I'm not a huge fan of scented oils but that tangerine scent takes my breath away (at time I do the eucalyptus too).

Then the facial begins. Overall a decent facial with Aveda products. Thing is as these are students (about to graduate from the Institute) and this place offers them real-life experience prior to starting their official career. Some things to note here:
1) They offer a good basic facial, however if you are looking for extraction, these students may not be experts in this and may not necessarily do a clean thorough job for you. Once, a student mistook my tiny mole to be a clogged pore and proceeded to ""extract"" that, leaving me slightly scarred. Ouch.

2) Since the students are not necessarily professionals, at times they will bring in their instructor for a second opinion. So it becomes a tedious process if you are one who just likes to relax and put yourself in the trust of your esthetician instead of engaging in interactive conversations

3) You ALWAYS have to fill up a form prior to the start of your appointment. Erm, store the info in a database so it can be pulled up automatically in future perhaps? OK maybe the cost of maintaining the d-base may not justify this but I'm sure there has to be some sort of ROI and profit for Aveda despite the low prices.

Nevertheless, most students aim to please and they try to give you an overall pleasant experience. I think they may be judged too. They try very hard. However, I've since left for greener pastures.",2009-01-12 00:14:40

The place was packed so we went to the upstairs bar and there was no wait. I had a huckleberry lemonade and it was way too sweet for my taste so I switched to wine.

It took 2.5 hours for dinner, which was ok, we were with a group of friends and enjoying their company but its not really a long dinner place since the music is too loud to talk. 

I had the Americano pizza which I shared with friends and everyone liked it. Hubby had the Porchetta sandwich and it was excellent. At the end of the meal our appetizer showed up - it didn't dawn on the runner that she was delivering an appetizer to a table full of empty plates and when I told her we didn't want it, that we were waiting for a check, she gave me an incredulous look and just stood there in silence. Our waitress seemed to think it was a big favor that they were going to take the appetizer off the check and said that the bar puts out some of the appetizers and they were backed up (nevermind the fact that we'd been at our table for 2 hours by then, that's pretty backed up).

There was an entire section of different tweaks on Eggs Benedict. Peg got the BLT Benedict which was delicious.  I got an omelet filled with green chili pork, sausage...and lots of other goodies.

It came with four potato pancakes.  Now, these are NOT latkes, these are four extremely thin, almost flavorless sheets of potato.  As if someone made hash browns, froze them, and shaved a few layers off of the top.  It needed salt, pepper, anything.

Food 3.5/5
- started with the Cajun shrimp which was delicious and the best part of the meal
-I also tried the watermelon gazpacho which was a nice summer starter. 
-both dishes had a bit of heat 
-I had the salmon for the main. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the wine citrus butter sauce was so delicious. However, it came with sauteed mango ginger that was mushy and did not add anything to the plate.
-for dessert, the only choice was a trio of chocolate mousse on a cookie, mango panna cotta, and a banana spring roll with caramel sauce. I love dessert. Unfortunately, the chocolate mousse on a cookie was nothing special and the mango panna cotta tasted like fruit cocktail from the can. The best part of the trio was the banana spring roll with caramel sauce; however, that was mediocre at best.

This Wal Mart is very new! This Wal Mart was placed inside an old Meryn's department store at the corner of Rural and Southern. As such, this isn't your typical Wal Mart. Each department is smaller than what you would usually expect.  Walking around the store, you can tell certain departments are smaller and condensed compared to other local Wal Marts in Mesa or the location on Elliott in Tempe.

The other day I went to Wal Mart to look for some bar soap that I've bought at Wal Mart many times. This location only sold Dial bar soap.
 
The food/bakery/produce/meat section is a little smaller than what you might be used to at other locations. What is offered should be more suitable to fullfill most of your shopping needs though.

One thing that irks me about this Wal Mart, is they don't have the hand held baskets when you only need to buy a few items. You need to get a cart or hope you can carry everything in your hands. I've inquired about this problem and was told that management has heard this complaint and is working on it. What is the hold up?

My husband loves the quinoa bowls and finds them sufficient in actually squashing his appetite - a rare feat at most health-centric dining venues. He's also praised their smoothies, a treat I have yet to experience.

My only other concern and hesitation toward coming here more often is the time it takes from ordering to eating. It appears as though everything is mostly cooked in advance and ready for assembly, yet it took almost a half hour the last time we grabbed lunch on a Saturday.

I will be honest. I was not the biggest fan of her newest material. She had some rough times and the optimism in her new stuff was refreshing, but I wanted more of the sassy country pop queen. Luckily for us all, it was predominantly her old hits with a peppering of her new songs. 

My friends and I were on the first mezzanine and although she was hard to make out at certain moments, I did not ever feel upset. I was just so enthralled by how she worked the crowd and appreciate her fans. 

From beginning to finish I was completely entranced by her stage presence and aura.",2013-06-03 01:08:37

I know my ice cream. Having eaten it since I was small, through many cities growing up...believe me, I heart my ice cream. 

I'm not really a fan of Mitchell's and other of the like, as they are way too sweet. I do love Jeni's, but man, driving to Chagrin Falls takes forever.

And having eaten my fair share of varying ice cream, from NYC to LA, I know good ice cream is rather hard to find at times.

I got an introduction to an amazing ice cream business that just opened up though! Enter- Mason's Creamery.

It was hot at this year's Asian Festival, so I left my booth and  wandered over to their stand. WHAT? I exclaimed as I looked at their menu. Asian inspired flavors? YESSSSSS! Finally, an Asian flavored ice cream place in CLE! Oh, I've been waiting for this day so long!

After contemplating over random flavors (like vanilla with pork floss- aka pork sung!) I chose the pandan and vietnamese coffee flavors. OMG, it was amazing. Not too sweet, just right. And OH SO SOFT. HOLY COW, this is GREAT ICE CREAM!! I exclaimed. Where are you located?? I inquired (hoping that it was close by so I could stop by there every day). ""We just moved here and are looking for a place soon"" they replied. Oh darn- but hey, I got a smartphone, I can follow them!

The couple who owns this business is super nice- they just moved to Cleveland from California, as the guy is actually from the area. They're super nice, down to earth people, which, makes eating ice cream quite enjoyable around them as well.

But man, their ice cream is GOOD. Like....REALLY REALLY GOOD. They don't have a set store yet, but they do go to local farmers markets as well as traveling with the food trucks- just follow their facebook page to see where they are! https://www.facebook.com/masonscreamery

Now coming here a second time was a different experience since it was a party of 4 at a table rather than 2 in front of a sushi master. However,  still a highly pleasurable experience.  I think this place is specially made for couples that can sit in front of their own sushi master.  

There is nothing like this place in the desert, or on the strip (thankfully not).  We are so lucky to have this unadulterated sushi in the desert.  No question, Kabuto is the place.  So simple you may question why pay so much?  From the attentive service to the detail in presentation, more importantly the fresh fish; there is no sushi experience like it.  Frankly the omakase is a steal. Look at the various menus yelpers post...have you been able to be so specific on the type of species of fish/seafood you are eating?  With this day and age of mislabeling of fish, dining at Kabuto, you can be assured you are getting  real authentic sushi.  A learning lesson for me, make your reservations early in the evening...once the fish is finished it is 86ed from the menu; by the end of our meal which started at 8:00 pm (the restaurant only opens at 6 pm)  there was only 4 fishes to choose from.  Not disappointed, you know it is fresh and also selective, when it is gone 1/2 way through dinner service, you know it is good and fresh.  I truly feel privileged to eat here.  My guests from NYC were equally impressed.

Furthermore, one of my guest had a shellfish allergy and they ensure all his sushi remained ""pure"".  He left completely unscathed and raving about the sushi.  

Go! Especially for a special occasion...promotion, birthday, or anniversary.  Kabuto will only accentuate the celebration.

The main entrees tend to run about $10 on average, and they have appitizers with smaller portions for a little bit less.  Being that I was starving, but not wanting a humungous portion I couldnt finish, I stuck with the appitizer.

Baby Octopus BBQ skewer - Very delicious and tender! 

Taiwanese Sausage skewer - It was sweet, but not overly too sweet. It was pretty tasty.

Spicy Miso Ramen w/ Pork - The broth was delicious and even better with the chili oil. The only downside for my husband were the veggies. He said there were way too many in the bowl. 

Katsu Don Rice Bowl - There wasn't anything too exciting about this bowl. The bowl consisted of rice, breaded chicken, eggs and veggies.

However, one of my all time favorite thing on their menu is the bruschetta. I dream and crave for it all the time. Their freshly diced, not watery tomatoes, basil and seasoning tossed in a balsamic vinegar. Topped with feta cheese and fresh basil on a nicely, heavenly garlic toast and don't forget the icing which is drizzled balsamic glaze. Whatever they're doing. The tomatoes alway taste like it's in season. And the balsamic glaze make it a little sweet. Omg, writing about it make my mouth water and I just had it today.

Yes, you'll easily drop $100 for two people, but if you're in the mood for fancy pants food then this is the place to go!

It used to be around the corner where Ryerson is but since the fire, it is now hidden in the second/third floor of a building. Just walk north from Eatons and you will see the sign Salad King right before you hit Elm Street. Otherwise, just use google maps.

Service
They are super fast, and I love how they refill my water. Gosh, you don't know how difficult it is to have a restaurant that regularly refills your water without being asked. They function like a fast food chain, zoom zoom baby.

Food

They have some signature dishes and behold, even a secret menu (reminds me of Starbucks). Before you order, make sure to look on the right (or maybe left) of their paper menu. It will list the level of spiciness - beginning with medium and gradually increasing with the number of peppers. I typically don't go more than 1 pepper but if you like adventure, please try it out yourself.

Golden Curry with Chicken
They have 3 different types of curry, with golden curry being their best seller. Now at medium spicy level, it tastes more sweet than hot. I think that's due to the coconut milk and my dad experienced a sour taste as well. I say it's a safe way to go and I love how they stack their rice into a pyramid shape lols.

Thai Noodle Soup
Average at best, this thing tasted so bland. It's not one of their signature dishes - though it didn't taste horrible, I would move on. You could do a better job cooking at home.

Seafood Fried Rice 
I have a feeling that portion sizes have shrunk but the quality is still top notch. Finally, rice that tastes good and doesn't crumble. Furthermore, they add lots of seasoning to the rice and their squid is mmm yummy. Not too chewy, not too soft. This is one dish I always go back to when I visit Salad King.

Not a bad restaurant for Thai food and the prices are fair. I really hate sitting where the long tables are because frankly, where the hell am I going to put my big jacket and purse? Other than that, the restaurant is quite consistent with their quality though it is nothing to praise about.",2014-12-08 01:22:32

I got two asada tacos, and one lengua tacos. Man oh man, the tortillas are defo homemade and handmade with love. I took a bite out of my asada taco and surprise in the bottom, refried beans! I wasn't expecting that!

The chips and salsa...well the salsa was also unexpecting full of sweet and spicy. The tomatoes were cut not into diced and square norms but smashed. I actually enjoyed it. It had a taste of sweetness from the tomatoes and actually spiciness of it being a salsa.

It is a pretty big property so the experience is similar to staying at MGM or Cesar's but I actually think their signage is a little better so I never got lost and was always able to find my way back to the room. I also appreciate that they have someone checking room keys day and night to make sure no one gets on the elevators other than people who are staying there (or overnight guests of someone staying there, wink, wink... hey it's Vegas after all).

I found the room to be plain but adequate. The bathroom was pretty nice. There was nice tile/granite and a big garden tub that was behind the shower so if the water overflowed it went down the shower drain. Very smart. However, I did notice some of the bathroom tiles had a little bit of staining/mildew. So, not perfect. Really my only major issue was the bed. It was just not comfortable. It felt really lumpy. It was soft, which is how I prefer my mattresses, but it just felt worn out. I also didn't like that they had a synthetic comforter instead of a duvet with a sheet cover that could be washed. Most hotels are doing that nowadays for sanitary reasons. Also, their ""blackout"" curtains let in a bunch of light from the top which also made it difficult to sleep late. Anyway for whatever reason I just couldn't get a good sleep there and so that is the main reason for subtracting a couple stars. I mean, you can go to any casino in Vegas to gamble/eat/drink but you need a comfortable sleep afterwards so that's the main reason for staying somewhere nice, right?

I do still think Aria is a great property, though. I like their understated d√©cor and lack of a cheesy theme. I don't really care for their buffet but all the other restaurants we've tried have been very good. And we did get a chance to use their pool area and it was really nice as well. A major bummer was that they did not have anyone serving drinks and there was always a line at the bar. Someone needs to tell Aria that the recession is over and they need to staff up. They did not have enough valets or people working the front desk either. Or servers in the casino area. One day our room did not get cleaned at all.

The Keg Mansion is one of the chains from the Keg Steakhouse but it is in a heritage building and it is also known to be haunted with ghosts. Spooky ....

It was also a great UW reunion, it's really hard now to get the group together. There was a big group of us and the downstairs dining room was packed with people and it was only 6pm. We went upstairs to try our luck at the upstairs dining room, there wasn't many big tables available as most of them sits 2-4 people. But we were in luck that they had a large table at the back but they wouldn't sit us until there was 80% of us on site.

There were lots of steak options, and decided on the 8oz blackened sirloin coated with herb butter and baked potato. The steak was not bad, but ever since I had that A5 Black Tajima, no steak I tried afterwards has been comparable. So I don't want to be bias but the Keg's steak was ok, worth the price I paid is what I can say. The herb butter melted into the steak so it was not dry, didn't have to order separate sauce.

On almost every front (ambiance, service, food, etc.) it delivers, but for some reason, it's just missing the ""magic"".  I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because I've had not one, but two great meals here within two months time (and consistency in this business is hard to come by!).

The combination between Legume and its accompanying bar, Butterjoint, is one to be reckoned with.  While I'm typically a beer guy, the cocktails I sampled on both occasions (plus one visiting Butterjoint itself) were solid.

Relative to appetizers, I highly recommend any of the pates or tartars the make the menu for that night (they feature a seasonal menu that changes daily).  In addition, one of the cheapest options on the menu, the goat cheese and pepper crostini ($5), is one of the best!

Both of my entrees were great.  The duck confit course on my first visit nailed that delicate balance between tender, perfectly cooked meat and that addictive crunchy skin that offsets its texture and the pork/poultry combo for my second was delicately prepared and well balanced.

On both occasions, the Shaker Corn side was the star of the show.  Dried corn that's re-hydrated and cooked in mini cast iron skillets with a creamy sauce.  Best of all, my desserts in both cases were great, my favorite being the knock-out banana and chocolate chunk cake with pecans, banana anglais and salted caramel ice cream (the fat kid in me was in heaven).

I could taste a hint of it every once in a while which wasn't so bad since the chicken and the slaw were tasty but for a grilled cheese place, I would've thought there'd be a bit more cheese to the sandwich.

The slaw on the sandwich wasn't the creamy type which I was happy about.  I'm not a fan of mayo based slaw.  It was very well flavored and seasoned and complemented the chicken very well.

The servers wear clean white uniforms but are tatted up with hipster hair and gauged ears, this is a weird but charming place to be. I like it. Everyone on staff was pleasant as well.

Everything is complimented beautifully, sweet with spicy, hot with cool, chewy with smooth, acidic with base. Food is best enjoyed paired with an equal food of great taste and quality, and Hanny's does it right.

My only gripe would be the music...the music selection is fine, it works for the vibe and atmosphere, it's the volume and BASS that are disorienting. The bass is seriously way too loud and deep for a dining room, it can downright annoy your ears. I know that sounds like an old person's complaint, but it's valid, the bass needs to be turned down.

My chicken tenders were a bit over done, but I've had much worse - at least they had flavor and a bit of juice inside and the BBQ dipping sauce was probably out of a jar, but still tasty - probably the same stuff I use at home so I really cannot complain there.

She did not score high at all :( It looked so yummy but on the first bite the meat in it was cold and had a weird taste then the sauce itself was so bland. I never send food back but this was not worth trying to swallow :( I was so sad as I LOVE Huevos Rancheros. The server did noticed and kindly suggested the pancakes so I ordered the carrot cake. Now that dish was pure heaven!!!! 

Would I go back? Yes. I would try s different HASH but if that fails, I will just stick to the sweets and bloody Mary's!  I gave 4stars due to the servers acknowledgement and bringing me something yummy instead, the sweet lady up front and the kick ass blood's. Oh yeah and I have her more tip then the app suggested for her recommendation of the yummy carrot cakes.The good out weighed the bad... Please HASH KITCHEN, retrain servers on timing. Timing is of essence. Thank you ;)",2016-08-16 20:43:28

I've taken a few friends and my mom here and they are now loyal addicts of this place.  We usually order the crispy beef (wonderfully tangy flavor...originally the wait staff's recommendation when we asked what was popular...and now frequently order it).  One thing to note though about the crispy beef, if you have wheat/gluten sensitivity like I do, this dish might make you bloated or hurt your stomach.  I think the coating might have some flour in it.  Some days I decide to take the discomfort for the amazing dish....if I were on a first date, probably not.  Around my boyfriend, I don't care.  All else, I've never had any reaction to.  In the past, have ordered the onion/mint/lime/fish sauce-flavored  pork larb, green curry, mussamun curry (which is their closest to ""yellow curry""...Mussamun being closer to a Persian version, or at least that's what the name means), Pad Kee Mao and appetizer Miang Puo.  I can't think of a dish that has disappointed.  A lot of times, there will be maybe one dish that is ""okay"" but this place takes trophies for all the dishes we've had so far.  It's impressive.   I've ordered for pick-up as well and had smooth transactions.  The wait staff have all been wonderful and timely for the most part.  Not a bad experience sticks out.  The price is higher for the smaller serving...maybe you pay for what you get?  I watch my budget so don't eat here as frequently as I wish I could because of the price....but nonetheless, it's been satisfying in terms of excellent cuisine and service.  Me and my guests have never ordered wine so unable to review that portion.  We usually call for reservations because although many posters say it's empty, on a Friday or weekend day, it can fill up fast.  I've seen parties come in unable to be seated.

It definetely the most pricey AYCE bbq I have ever been to. It is also insanely busy! We came on a week night around 7pm and the wait was 30-40 minutes, and I imagine it will become even more popular as more people discover it.

Everything was crazy delicous, and nothing was seasoned or marinated too heavily. The cuts of meat were thin, and they offered an array of vegetables and side dishes that I have never seen before in any kbbq place. You order the meat by individual pieces, but if you don't specify the waiter will serve 5-10 pieces in a dish. Some of their most outstanding dishes were: miso soup, miso beef brisket, boneless kalbi, black pepper steak, and beef tongue. They also serve small bowls of bibimbap, which is a nice alternative to just plain white rice. The last praise worthy dish is their desserts! Which includes Melona ice cream bars and creme brulee which was surprisingly creamy and rich. 

The service was also fantastic! They were all super friendly and considerate, unlike most AYCE places where the waiters just throw food at you. They made sure to patiently explain how ordering works and were very prompt in clearing dished and taking orders. 

The ambiance is great. All the chairs/tables are set up like booths so there is plenty of privacy. The overall place is tiny, which really can't accomondate the traffic it gets!",2017-11-10 10:16:29

Their anniversary is coming up, my mother's birthday is coming up, and my husband and I both just had birthdays. And the dining room at home is full of our moving boxes. So we decided to go out.

There were five of us. The grownups drank wine while my husband and I drank beer. Pints on tap are under $7 for imported stuff. Wine starts at $20 for a half litre carafe, which fills about three glasses and a bit. There were a few different house reds and they settled on a Malbec which turned out to be very nice.

On the back of the menu I discovered the group dinner deal -- dinner for four for $89.95. What they call dinner for four involves pappadums and three other set appetizers, our choice of three meat dishes and two veggie dishes, naan and rice, and coffee and tea. We asked the waitress if the five of us could get by on the dinner for four or if we should order more, and she said we'd be fine with the dinner for four as it stands. (The service was great, quick and friendly, and the waitress and I had a rather geeky conversation about beer. Note to self: seek out beer from Double Trouble Brewing.) So here's what we got. All the entrees came in bowls to share.

Bharta (smoked eggplant) studded with bright green peas, very smokey and spicier than I'm used to. Tasty but overwhelmingly flavoured, which is odd for bharta. A bit of a chore to finish.

Chicken tikka masala: bright red, spicy and intense. Big chunks of onion. Really lovely.

Goanese fish and prawns: blew me away. Tingly coconut gravy on big pieces of buttery white fish. Of all the fish I've tried since I started eating meat again, this has got to be the best. Too bad there isn't more of it. I didn't get any of the shrimp but I didn't care.

Lamb in shakuti sauce: mild, creamy coconut sauce and bits of lamb that are very tender and not greasy.

Aloo gobhi masala: just what it says on the tin, spiced potatoes and cauliflower. I'm not a big fan, but then again I've never had a bad aloo gobhi. 

I have to specifically mention the tea, for which I chose masala chai. I was slightly saddened that I didn't have room for dessert (the 'dinner for four' was enough to make three seniors and two thirtysomethings walk very slowly afterwards and collapse in food comas at home) but the tea fixed that. It came with the cream added -- or was it condensed milk? -- and tasted like I was drinking a bowl of gulab jamun. You know how in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' there's gum that makes you think you're eating a meal while you're chewing gum? It was like that.

Overall: the food was intense and luxurious, a sensory experience worthy of being named after that chapter of the Kama Sutra that we in the West obsess about. That said, it probably won't be hot enough for folks who know what real Indian food is like. (This pepperhead white girl was quite pleasantly hopped up on endorphins by the end of dinner.) The decor is comfortably dark and velvety without being uncomfortably pretentious. Can it be? -- there's no step up to get inside, and even the washrooms are on the main floor. This is a classy place with great food, and you can have a luxurious dinner while dressing casually and not spending as much as you'd think. I've had takeout from them before and it didn't prepare me for the experience of eating there. Thumbs up all around. 

Note: it was a Thursday after 7 pm and the place was deserted. We were still asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't. I suspect huge crowds on Friday nights.",2012-06-08 02:38:11

I like the interactive aspects of the museum, and although I did not read everything on all the walls, I appreciate how much effort went into the informative side of the museum. The fact that there are many ways to interact and learn about the subject matter is a refreshing new twist on a way to visit a museum.

You could spend HOURS in the museum if you really wanted to. There are 3 floors, so don't look at the building and think ""that's too small for a museum!"". They really have taken the space and made it into something special, while still keeping the historic court room (which is why this building is registered). 

For $10 for locals this is a complete bargain for something fun to do when you're bored. Even tourists will love The Mob Museum, I think the entry fee for them is $18. I think that too it a pretty decent price for being able to leisurely walk through a museum with such fun subject matter.

The one thing that rubbed me the wrong way is the payment/check-in process. If you pay with a card you get 2 receipts, a wrist band, AND a ticket. I stopped to shove all my stuff in my purse, except the wrist band, took the time to put it on (myself) and then as I approached the woman who would let us into the museum she requested my actual ticket, which had been shoved into the depths of my purse! So, I had to rummage around for it. Pick one or the other Mob Museum - ticket or wristband. Too many of these things makes the process of getting in annoying.",2012-05-06 17:05:52

Horrible...... Just absolutely sad & horrible.

Horrible food..... horrible management!

Here's the why:

The hostess seemed to me like a snotty teenager with an attitude. You know the type, an obviously self-absorbed, entitled millennial with more attitude than personal skills or intelligence. If only Twitter, Facebook and The Kardashians (likely her life-guides) would tell her to act professional and friendly. 

I won't hate on the kid waiting our table because none of this was his fault. He didn't cook the lousy food or fail miserably on the other aspects of this nightmare. He seemed like a cool young guy who was doing what he should be doing: working hard and making a living. Bravo to him. 

Lets start with the manager, or whatever level of supervisor she was.  An unhappy looking middle aged lady. The order was wrong and instead of keeping her pie hole shut and fixing it she wanted to argue...... really? Look, I'm not ""tough customer,"" I was a waiter & cook for years and I know that when a customer wants something fixed it's easier to just do it than to be a wanker about it. ""The Customer is King"" was a slogan that created many great businesses, and it is truly dead in today's America. This miserable old lady reaffirmed that. 

The food sucked! The steaks were not steaks..... I'm not kidding. I honestly think they were some type of skirt or flank being passed off as better cuts. Greasy, fatty and caked in salt. HORRIBLE!

I heard two other close tables talking and it was obvious they were having the same lousy experience we were.  

We had several folks in our party with various dishes. Everyone had the same bad experience, I was so embarrassed.... I picked this dump. I had eaten at another Appelbee's about a year ago and it was decent. This location just sucked.

Go ahead and try this spot out....... if you enjoy REHEATED meat dishes and snotty management that wants to argue. Otherwise avoid this spot like a dog turd in the street friends. HORRIBLE!

Well, I guess you can look at our meal at Hao two ways: either Yelp DID steer us wrong or we should have paid better attention to a phrase used in many of the Yelp reviews: ""best Chinese IN FOUNTAIN HILLS"".  Obviously, FH has a dearth of Asian restaurants.

As commented, the inside was MUCH more attractive and contemporary than the unpretentious exterior.  Dining room and bathrooms were VERY clean.  And of course it was empty, as it was 4 pm on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and our server was very nice and attentive.  (That's actually why they get 2 stars rather than one) So, I guess that leaves the food, right?

We started off with two appetizers---DS and I shared the crab puff and DH and DS's GF shared the egg rolls.  Actually, both were really good.  Fresh, hot, not greasy, tasty.  (But wait....)

Then we ordered entrees.  (Btw, hardly any entrees were more than 9.99, so I don't know what people were talking about this place being expensive)  I asked for Spicy Eggplant and Pork, DH got General Tso's chicken, DS got Sesame Chicken, and DS's GF got Vegetarian Chow Mein.  DS and I added the soup and eggroll---he got the egg drop and I got the hot and sour. (Additional $3 each)  Soup and eggrolls arrived promptly.  

He said his soup was okay, but ""didn't taste like anything"".  Same for my hot and sour.  The broth was a much paler brown than I am accustomed to with no depth of flavor.  There were a couple of small chunks of mystery meat and then giant peas and square carrots---like the kind you get in a freezer bag.  Not impressed.  However, the eggrolls were really good---no meat, but very fresh and well-cooked---but after a couple of bites, my son said ""Ugh"", and pulled about a 6 inch long hair out of his eggroll.  Yes, I know this kind of stuff happens and DS even made a joke, but basically, we both put our eggrolls down unfinished.  And no, we didn't say anything because DS was like: just forget it, Mom!

So the entrees arrived.  I was like uh-oh as soon as I saw DH's plate.  It literally had an entire can of water chestnuts in it.  He hates water chestnuts.  And maybe six 1 x 1 pieces of red pepper and the chicken.  DS's Sesame Chicken was exactly that: nuggets of fried chicken with a sticky sauce and sesame seeds.  DS GF's Veggie Chow Mein looked----remember that stuff you used to buy in a can with the little container of dry noodles?  I think we found out where all those extra cans went.  

And mine was okay.  Not spicy, not a lot of taste, but it was okay.  But everyone agreed their vegetables (except for DS, who had none) were either way over-cooked or had come out of a bag.  There was absolutely no ""tender-crisp crunch"" to them.  NOBODY cleaned their plate (a rarity among our crew) or asked for a take-away container.  

Consensus when we left: we'd rate our meals on average about 2.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  DH gave the lowest score at a 1 (he'd wanted to do minus one, but he did enjoy his eggroll) and I gave the highest at 4 (It was food, it was hot, I didn't get sick).

But really---best Chinese food in Fountain Hills?  I'd just go to Senor Taco.",2017-04-11 20:39:37

Foods is good if you order the right thing. Personally,  I recommend below:
--butter squid 
--Ebi Mayo: Their Ebi Mayo is a bit spicy 
--Oden: this is a awesome dish for winter time. Portion is big and soup base is awesome 
--Skewers: I like the pork one and the bacon one
However, if you go on weekends, it will be very pack. Thus, make sure you go early. Also the food comes very slow during weekends. We waited for at least 30mins for our first dish (Even sashimi came very slow).

What I like is that Sonic is consistently good in food quality and service. There has only been one instance where there was an order mix up and the Supervisor replaced our entire order free of charge.

My boyfriend and I live close to a Sonic so we stop by as often as we can for dinner on nights that I don't cook him a gourmet meal at home. 

I really enjoy their chicken bites and they have the best onion rings made with the sweet vidalia onions that is a must in my book, mmmm yum! I am also crazy about their tater tots, yes I know frozen and simple however for me it is just hard to cook tater tots at home that come out just right like theirs always do! We also enjoy their cheddar peppers with ranch dipping sauce awww yeah!

The only thing that I am disappointed by is that they changed the bun on their chicken sandwiches from a wheat bun to more of a ciabatta bread bun which is just not as good as the wheat hamburger bun they had before. Change does not always mean for the better unfortunately and I really miss the perfect combination of the grilled chicken sandwich with sweet wheat bun! Ugh

Anyhow, we are Sonic fans because the menu never gets boring as they have such a huge variety of on the go yummy items along with great slushes and shake flavors.

Sad to report that I have yet to try their namesake wood-fired chicken.  Too many other interesting and nice menu options that push chicken lower on the list.  I will eventually get there.

I can't remember the name of the dish...sorry, but it was a mix of mushrooms and chicken (ooops!) in a baking dish like a stew.  Rich, creamy and delicious.  And there is magic in the mixed mushrooms served as a side or appetizer.

The short rib is so yummy that you eat slowly to extend the ecstasy.  On the mashed potatoes!  Aaaaaaahhh!! 

Salads, from side to main course are generous and their dressings are made in-house so are wonderful.  Onion soup is as it should be:  rich, cheezy and hot.  

Service is great.  Wait staff have personalities, not over-done, and relate to the people at the table.

the orzo salad- sometimes it's 7.99/lb and sometimes it's 9.99/lb.

Dim sum are good, although too big to my personal taste. I like my dumpling to be no more than 2 fabulous bites. But at least, that's really worth the price. 6$ for 4 huge dumplings, that is decent.

Pekin duck is OK (rice pancakes are on the fluffy side), second ""crystal"" course is really good.

The drinks are very good here according to my dining buddy. The Smores campfire drink was tasted. I can say really good. They light it on fire right at your table. That smell will trigger every childhood memory you have. Ha! I shudder to think of the calorie content on that one though. 

The food was okay, not earth shattering but not bad either. I had the beet salad with whipped goat cheese. It was different. They use strands of greens so a little hard to eat but I liked it. I felt it could have used more beets though. My friend liked the brisket sandwich, again good but not outstanding. We also ordered the Brussle Sprouts which were not the best I have ever had, just okay. 

They have a game room in the back which is an added plus. I want to come back here and swing on the tire bar seats. I think this place would be a really fun place to gather friends for  a birthday or happy hour. The drinks are a bit pricey though.

The peanut sauce is lame. I think it's from a jar. The Kobe slider burger was dissapointing. The sauce was way too much and covering the kobe beef taste.

Price is expensive for lunch. Starts at $12 for appetizer and about $20-25 for main entree.

Our group was seated in the little patio area out back which was lovely - much less crowded and loud than the restaurant and great on a nice Montreal night. 

We all had the signature cocktail that night - a concoction which included home made ginger ale and rum and was all manner of fantastic. 

The wine menu is well thought out with some great options. Our bottle of white arrived perfectly chilled and our glasses never went empty. 

We shared a variety of starters from the menu and all raved about the lobster pizza - thin crust and perfectly garnished with a generous helping of lobster meat. 

I had the braised veal and octopus dish as a main and both elements were very well prepared and tasty. 

The real standouts for us were the desserts - we had 1 of everything and couldn't decide which one we loved more. 
The doughnuts are easily the best I've ever had - light and airy and not at all greasy and our waiter was spot-on when he joked that we would want to squirt the accompany lemon curd directly into our mouths. 
The banana coconut cream pie was fresh and light. 
The pancakes were very rich and decadent but buttery soft deliciousness.

First impression: this place is quite nice, despite construction on Williamson St and rennovation on the front porch (I believe they want to open an outdoor patio). Our waiter was super friendly and quite charming.
Now, the most interesting and important part, the foods!
Pork bun (2 pieces for $6): yummy yummy yummy.  Love the soft bun, super love the fatty pork, love the pickles, and the sauce. For me it was an umami experience (sweet, savory goodness). I also added the spicy bomb (I'll talk about this later) to add a little kick to it. In short, it was heaven in my mouth.
Large pork and chives dumpling ($8): Errr not worth the price. I don't think it's homemade but I could be wrong. For 8 dollar, I can go to a Japanese grocery store and get a pork dumpling and you won't taste the difference.
Tonkatsu ramen: Good noodle, great soup. However, the soup wasn't hot enough that you smell the porkiness of cold ramen (i want to say fishy, but not sure if they have fish stock at all). For the price and the small portion, I'd say it's overpriced. The only place I spent 12 bucks for a bowl of ramen was in NY, but the portion was bigger and it's NY afterall. I  We also added the spicy bomb for a dollar hoping it's something interesting but turns out it's like sambal oelek and we're very dissapointed with this addition. Why can't they give this for free?

He then went on to mansplain the art of Paella and why it is so difficult to get right, just before sliding in that this version was more like a decent (brand-not-to-be-mentioned) boxed rice dish. But whatever, this is supposed to be a signature dish at a top-flight establishment at a top-flight resort in Vegas. Disappointed.

FINE
Patatas Bravas: I found them a little dry and lacking any real ""Bravas"", dining companion liked them more. (Restaurant Rec)
Stuffed Piquillo Peppers: Love all the ingredients separately, but they didn't go together particularly well in this case. The peppers seemed too limp to be paired with a soft cheese, but the taste was decent. (Restaurant Rec)

GOOD
Mushroom Risotto: Much better rice dish than the Paella, great consistency and a ton of flavor.
Asparagus: Classic grilled flavor and perfect preparation. (Restaurant Rec)
Pan Manchego: So simple, so good. 

SERVICE
Server looked flummoxed by the notion of asking him (and by extension the chef) for recs on best vegetarian tapas. At a top-flight place like this, the recs should flow with ease (see my Casa Mono NYC review for what happens when recs go right). I think he became a little concerned when it was clear we were just trying to get the check and bounce, becoming more and more attentive and accommodating in tone. Not your fault, my man! We did need to rush off but were also pretty disappointed in the Paella. Solid service, no complaints. 

VERDICT 
Trendy joint and all those trappings - not an empty seat. Maybe the meat things are better, but average at best, overall, on the veg offerings. Can't screw up your Paella. Too many excellent dining options in Aria (let alone Vegas) for me to return to JS.",2018-05-21 17:18:42

We ordered the broiled rainbow trout, red beans and rice (soup of the day), and romaine salad.  The rainbow trout tasted off, like not fresh, nor good so we returned it.  The sauteed chard that came with it was very good.

The red beans and rice and romaine salad were good, I am told.  I did not try it myself.

After returning the trout, we ordered the roots bbq smoked brisket.  This was very good.  The smoked brisket was very soft and moist.  The pork belly bbq beans that came with it were awesome!! tastes like homemade.  Even the beans tasted fresh and not canned.  The cheddar grits were very good as well.  Cooked to perfection.

Service was very good.  Just remember don't order fish on a Monday anywhere.  lol.  It's forgivable since everything else was fantastic.  We both talked about coming back again.

We took the key lime pie to go.  It was heavenly.  Tasted homemade.

Update: Came back on a Wednesday and ordered the blackened redfish and gumbo.  Gumbo had a good taste 3.5 stars.  The blackened redfish was super yummy!! about as good as you are going to get it in Arizona.  5-stars.  the rice pilaf that came with it was 1.5 stars.",2017-08-01 00:53:10

I ordered the original chicken with mild spiciness and it was delicious but I probably could have handled a little more spiciness (for next time). The chicken was as big as my face, super tasty, juicy and tender. It came out piping hot and it was quite difficult to take a picture when it was hot lol. 

The downside to this place was that it took them about 15 minutes to make, so it's definitely not a place I'd go to especially if I'm in a hurry. I also found the price to be slightly expensive (~$10 a piece) when at Costco, I can buy a whole chicken for $10. I also didn't like how the seasoning/spice was powered and sprinkled on top 'cause it's not really special and I rather have them incorporated into the chicken. I much rather go to Kristy's Chicken in Markham where it's much closer to me and the taste is way better. There's also bones in the chicken so I found that a little inconvenient. 

On another note, while I was waiting for my chicken a homeless man walked into the store and asked for money which I found a little odd 'cause normally they stay outside.. 

Would i come back? Probably not unless they lowered the price and altered the way they made the chicken.",2017-05-29 00:53:48

Sounds like it's trying to ride the coattails of the successful fusion food truck movement 5 years ago. Except, it's probably 5 years too late. It tries to emulate the Chipotle concept of customization, but choices are fairly limited - you can choose between tofu (korma or makhani), chicken, or lamb in either a bowl or burrito. And while Chipotle's assembly line is expeditious, Desi was anything, but. It took nearly 20-25 minutes to receive our rather simple order. I can't imagine that boding well for the drive-through. 

Given that this endeavor is fairly new, there were many positives. I enjoyed my lamb stir fry wrapped in a flour tortilla with lemon rice. The flavors were great and the tortilla is a great substitute for the traditional naan, which may be too thick to wrap. The pani puri was also a nice, refreshing appetizer if you like chickpeas and mint. The combo comes with a side of seasoned fries and a canned soda.

While the concept is somewhat outdated, the food flavors were good. I wish there was something extra instead of just stuffing Indian food inside a burrito with cheese. Making the burritos a little larger and stuffing them with the seasoned fries would've been a better move. I think with a little refinement, this little spot can blow up, but their speed needs to pick up, especially with the hot summer months rolling around the corner.",2016-03-21 02:00:53

After dealing with a hostess, who didn't care that the OpenTable Reservation system had not worked for the past three days, we were seated at a very comfortable booth and our evening began.

To start, we ordered the Siberian Nachos, which are just spicy enough with a touch of Wasabi and some delicious Salmon.

I ordered a Kiev, which was good, but lacked the Banana taste it was alleged to contain.

It was followed up with some ""Pretzel Rolls"" which had just the right amount of salt to offset the Alcohol in my Kiev.

For an Entree, I ordered the Stroganoff. It was good, but not quite as wonderful as I had been led to believe.  I also tried the ""Lenin's Kryptonite"" which I enjoyed more than the Kiev, as it was slightly sweeter.

Dessert was ""Raspuin's Magic Chocolate Bar"" which did not disappoint.  I'd never heard of ""Peanut Butter Dust"" before!

As will all the Restaurants in Mandalay Bay, there is a price to be paid in the form of a high bill at the end. However, I was ultimately not discouraged and would very likely return again in the future.

Food:
One of the better chicken noodle soups I had where its not super salty to cover up the lack of chicken broth flavor. 
We wanted sweet potato fries and our server recommended the brisket fries. Taste just like bbq meat on fries thats all it is. Its not bad though just nothing to rave about either.

Low-down:
Zuppa Del Giorno - was a wild mushroom/potato puree was quite bland.  Server said there was dairy, but I didn't taste any cream.  

Burrata - basically a Caprese.  This was fine, cheese tasted nice and fresh.  You can't really screw this one up.

Calamari - Some came lightly battered, while the rest were grilled and tossed into a salad.  Battered was better than grilled, grilled lacked flavour.  Not the best, but not the worst calamari that I've had.  On the bland side

Cod Ravioli - Pastas are made in-house, but it was bland and too al dente/chewy.  It was tossed in olive oil, so if you're looking for pasta with sauce, order another dish.

Black Cod in Tagine - to be expected, it had more flavour than the ravioli, but more on the sweet side as it had slices of mandarin oranges in the sauce.  At this point, I was stuffed from everything else, so I brought the rest home

On the other hand, desserts were really good!  Too bad, I was a bit too full to enjoy them.  According to the menu, someone else makes the desserts.

I got a bit turned around because I had no idea it was Pride day, or weekend. So I called the restaurant and asked them for directions. Whomever picked up the phone was very helpful and got me to the location quickly. 

We arrived an hour after opening and with the festival going on it was empty. By empty I mean we were the only people in the restaurant, which I think is awesome. What was not so awesome was how the stage was right by the restaurant so I could barely hear God awful pop music throughout our meal. Like everyone else has said, its a beautiful restaurant. The wood tables are stunning, the chandeliers are really neat. It has a very tranquil feeling. 

We ordered the snack board and it came out promptly. The black bean hummus was better than I expected, very smooth. The pimento cheese was very flavorful with a bit of spice on the back end but was a bit dry. The dryness was only annoying because it was crumbly and kept rolling off my pita.  Deviled eggs were good, a bit standard but the yolk was creamy and the mustard caviar was a nice touch. 

My entree consisted of two South Carolina buckwheat Johnnycakes with a peach bourbon syrup, paired with livermush and a side order of grits. Growing up in the south I know all about livermush but had never consumed it. So I wanted to be proper south. The Johnnycakes were huge and a bit burnt, which I loved. I loved that they did not drown them in the peach bourbon syrup, even though the syrup was great I hate soggy food. I took a stab at the livermush and I did not enjoy it. It was just to weird for me, my aunt said I would either love or hate it. Our waiter was quick to get me some bacon which he coined ""Old reliable"". It was cut thick with a nice smokey flavor. I do have to say the grits were my favorite part of my meal. For me, grits usually suck. They are either to watery or to dry, or taste like Quaker oats instant. These were creamy, rice and had a nice thick texture. I destroyed them.

Nothing really separates it from other pubs in the city, but every time I've gone it's been a great experience.  In fact, each time I've gone has been for pretty different reasons.

I've been for the normal reasons, sure, like to get drunk or grab a quick meal during lunch.  But I've also been for work functions, stampede parties, birthdays, and other reasons I can't remember thanks to the large amount of alcohol consumed.  Each time was great fun.

The normal experiences always exceeded my expectations.  The service was great, the food was above average for a pub-style location, and the people always friendly.  I'm not sure what it is, but everyone always seems to be enjoying themselves at Barley Mill.

The group functions is where they really shine though.  And really, being downtown, they have to.  I imagine they get a lot of business from downtown corporations wanting to hold events there.  We recently attended a work function for my fiances employer where they had rented out the entire upper level.  The food, while only finger food, was really good and well prepared.

Barley Mill has lots of options for sitting outside.  They have a patio around back that fills up quickly.

I was a bit late out of the house, but when I got there at 4:15 pm, there were lots more $1 cupcakes, including the elusive guava. Also, there were new cronuts at $2 (non-clearance price).

First, the new cupcake flavors that I managed to get:

- The guava lived up to my friend's hype. It wasn't overly sweet, and the guava flavor was fairly subtle but distinct. It was humming a soft melody in my ear. To my taste buds.
- The mango cupcake was also really nicely balanced. But having had the guava cupcake, I hoped for actual mango flavor. It does not taste like real mango. All I could determine was that it was some sort of 'tropical"" flavor that a casual sweets eater might not question. It is good, but I'd prefer most other flavors instead.
- Ditto on strawberry. It's restrained in sweetness, and I like the strawberry in the cupcake itself. I guess artificial strawberry is a little more commonplace, but that's what it all is.
- The red velvet is pretty awesome. The icing is rich and creamy, but not too sweet. I'd have been happy to keep all five that I bought, but I shared some with my friend.
- The peanut butter isn't as intense as peanut butter from a jar, but you won't mistake it for any other flavor and it's a little more filling than a purely sugar-y flavory.

And the brand new cronuts:

- There are 5 flavors listed: cinnamon sugar, vinnla glaze, chocolate glaze, chocolate dipped, and plain sugar. They also make different creme filled cronuts each day. They had vanilla and mango creme when I was there.
- The texture is awesome. A little bit of crunch greets your mouth, then it gives way to a soft, flaky croissant dough.
- I had two flavors. The mango creme filled donut has the same non-authentic flavor as the mango cupcake, while the chocolate glaze definitely has the taste of a chocolate donut, not that of a chocolate croissant (which tends to be a bit darker, I think).",2014-04-07 04:59:19

The Orange Chicken was different than normal orange chicken - it reminded me of a buffalo chicken with a sweet kick to it. The Pillow Chicken was something I never had before and personally I did not like it. It reminded me of a crab cake or salmon patty...two things that I do not like; it is a texture issue not a taste issue.

If I were to translate how objectionable some of our stations are from American to Canadian, I'd say this:  ....many NYC subway stations are fetid cesspools of moose guts and used hockey undergarments, covered in a brown gravy you can only pray is leftover from making poutine, but you know there's too much DNA in that brown liquid so you just have to turn your head and shudder and think happier thoughts of Dave Coulier.

So, maybe I'm jaded but I found Kipling station to be a clean, well-lighted place.  The bus transfers are well marked.

However, you can use both bus doors to load so just stand near the rear and elbow your way on.  It helps to look for the weakest pack of people so you can intimidate and out maneuver them.

Kipling to me is an efficient and useful transfer point and a great place to start your TTC subway journey or bus ride!",2012-07-03 13:06:09

As mentioned in a previous review, the place IS small.  If you're looking to discuss your upcoming wart removal, you may want to save that convo for a different venue.  However, as small as it is, it never got very loud which made it easy to chat with my companions.  

A previous reviewer mentioned the boxed Franzia wine in the kitchen.  I noted that as well but it seems like they're cooking with it and not serving it.  Our waiter made a wine suggestion that I quite enjoyed.  Two of my companions got the wine pairing and raved about the selections.  

The flavors and combinations of some of the dishes were inventive, experimental, and at times downright brilliant.  It is the sort of creativity that I have enjoyed at Binkley's many times.  There was one major stumble though - the awful pink and orange mess of the seafood dish with the shrimp and the clams.  I applaud the creativity in pairing strawberry mousse with seafood but visually, it doesn't work.  I didn't find that the flavors worked very well but truthfully, I was really distracted by the garish presentation.  I also did not care for the gelatin dessert but my dining companions quite enjoyed it.  

My major, major issue with our evening there was the silverware.  With each course, we were asked to keep our silverware which I think is tacky.  Where it went from bad to worse is when the dessert courses came and we were eating flourless chocolate cake with the same fork that had made sweet love to artichokes, mushrooms, cauliflower and duck.

This was one of the first places I bookmarked when we moved here back in May. I tried to surprise my sweet tooth husband on his lunch break by bringing him here on his lunch break on a Wednesday afternoon (around 2:30PM) and he was pretty excited too until he ordered his sammie and was told they didn't have chocolate chip cookies. I will say that for a week day afternoon it was pretty busy but chocolate chip is like the main cookie flavor? I just thought that was super weird to run out in the middle of the day. There were other cookie options like sugar, double dark chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and oatmeal with white chocolate and coconut but my husband is a simple man with simple pleasures so he opted to not get anything. I don't know if anyone else HATES eating when other people aren't eating but I instantly felt like crap for hyping this place up and then not being able to deliver to my hype, lol. I didn't feel bad enough to where I didn't order though, so I ordered an oatmeal with white chocolate and coconut sammie with coconut ice cream topped with Oreo pieces and Fruity Pepples. I hate Fruity Pepples in milk but on ice cream - bomb. I had tried a sample of the cookie that had been out so that's why it was hard but the actual cookie I received was soft and I don't like soft cookies so that threw me off. The ice cream was amazing though, it had that homemade ice cream taste that made me all nostalgic for when my grandma had an ice cream machine and would make me ice cream back in Belize. Aw. Anyway, I actually just ate the ice cream and picked at the cookie which defeated the purpose of getting a sammie. All in all, I think my experience definitely isn't the standard but it was enough me for to pass on trying them again just because I'd rather try another dessert spot instead. That coconut ice cream was everything though.

Oh and there's a Yelp check-in offer for two free ""edge"" toppings. I don't know what that means since the topping are kind of applied all over the ice cream and not just on the edge of the sammie but my server didn't specify if that meant I got three toppings since the sammie already comes with one or if it was two altogether so I just got two?

We arrived in the afternoon on a weekend and quickly grabbed a couple of seats by the street. (It's not quite a patio but it was close enough to make me happy.)

We decided to start with the Green Plantain Tostones (""Deep fried smashed green plantain served with herb mayo""). I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this dish but it pretty much blew me away. The plantains were perfectly deep-fried - i.e. they were crispy on the outside and delectably creamy on the inside - and the accompanying herb mayo was a perfect complement. The plantains were maybe a little too salty but this is an awfully minor complaint.

For my main, I went with the Carne Mechada arepa (""Shredded flank steak, tomato, garlic, sweet pepper, cumin""). It arrived to the table piping hot, which is always a plus. And although the shredded flank steak was indeed quite tasty, it was so plentiful that it essentially turned the arepa soggy. I gave up trying to eat it like a sandwich and wound up eating more than half with my fork.

I also want to single out the three sauces that were provided with the meal. They were all amazing and ideally suited for the arepa. (And the spicy one is knock-you-off-your-chair hot but also impressively flavorful.)",2018-05-22 14:06:02

Positives: We checked into the room and the guy at the front desk was awesome. He found out we were here for our anniversary and he upgraded our room to a strip view at no cost. We made sure we tipped him for the nice gesture. The weekend seemed to be starting out well. We got to our hotel room and it was beautiful. I am big on bathroom tubs because I love bubble baths. The design of the bathroom was clever with the shower and tub together behind the glass door. The front desk during checkout was friendly along with the bellman that waited by us in Valet with our bags. The best worker was Chandra. I hope that's her name. She's the one that goes around and signs you up for players cards. These few were the only decent workers in the entire hotel and casino. The highlight of our stay was the Aria spa. I highly recommend that place. 

Negatives: Bartenders at the sportsbar were horrible. They had terrible service. Not very friendly. Also not very present. We sat in the back because there were no other open seats but then we realized they barely pay attention to people sitting in the back. We tried both Friday and Saturday night. After having bad service on Friday we tried again because we saw there were different bartenders.  They acted the same way the bartenders were on Friday night. That's when we realized it's probably a management issue. 

Valet takes long. The workers in valet were nice but for some reason it took so long to get our car on a Friday night when we could see our car parked out in front. All we really needed were the keys. It was extremely windy and cold so it seemed even longer. 

Our service button light was broken in our room causing the mini bar attendant to open our hotel room door. He did it twice. My husband had to scream out to not open the door and to wait until we answered it. We got late check out but right at 11am during the regular checkout time, house keeping opened our door while we were sleeping.

Tucked away in a corner of the plaza, the worst part of the China Magic Noodle House experience is decidedly the parking. Even so, you can usually find a spot pretty close to the entrance because it's fairly far from the Lee Lee's. 

The first thing you should do for yourself after you sit down is order the dumplings. For real. They are gargantuan and hearty and wonderful. I prefer them pan-fried, but the steamed are also great. They are probably my favorite dumplings in the entire world. Strong words, I know. Another appetizer I'd recommend is the assorted marinated meat platter. I couldn't for the life of me identify which meats they are, but are served cold and are excellent, and come with pickled vegetables that pair perfectly. 

Also highly recommended are any of the stir fry noodles. My personal favorite are the beef with XO sauce, because they are just the perfect amount of spicy, in my opinion. We also had the noodles with spicy sauce (a separate menu item) and would probably pass on those next time. They're good, but just don't hold a candle to the stir fried.

Sort of a soup/stew with assorted ingredients like enoki mushrooms, spam, wiener (sausage), onions, green onions, tofu, rice cake (ddukbokki), pork, ramen, cheese, kimchi. Hot and delicious. Cost about $28.

Things to note. The rice was purple rice (no need to upgrade). They served 8 banchan (side dishes) before our meal came. There was kimchi, cucumber kimchi, tofu with spicy sauce, japchae, bean sprouts, sliced cucumber (not sure how this one was cooked), shredded potato and some potato chunks covered in a sweet, slightly spicy sauce. It was my first time trying that last one and it was incredible. Had I not been so full, I would have asked for more.

The menu said this one dish was for 2 people, but we ended up having a bowl of rice and almost half our dish left over. Doggy bagged it! Thrilled. Total damage after tax, before tips was just over $31.

Oh. They give you orange slices when you ask for your bill. They don't have takeout menus. Service was fairly good.

Will definitely be back.",2014-11-20 02:07:06

Based on my previous expierences with Banjara on Yonge/Eg, I decided to go to Banjara. I got the butter chicken thali which included rice, naan, pakora and a couple of veggie curries for $11.99.

The naan was delicious however I found the butter chicken was quite westernized.  I ordered mild and when I order mild at other Indian restaurants, there is usually some heat.  There was none here.  

I think this place is a-ok for Indian food starters but if you are looking for very authentic, this may not the place.  So give it a try if you have friends that are apprehensive about Indian food, otherwise there are better options.

This is your typical Chinese place, packed and cleanliness comes into question. The ordering is also simple, they give you a order sheet and you write down how much of each item you want. There's English beside it and a photo menu accompaniment. 

Now let's go down to the meat of things!! For a dumpling place, this place sucks, like I can go to a dumpling frozen store, buy their dumplings and steam it at home and it would be better. I'm not a master chef by any means, but ordering like 6 different dumplings that come with 15 dumplings and they all suck says something regardless of being made on site or not. They definitely need a new cook to prepare the steam dumplings. Which place is better for dumplings? Metro plaza at warden and Steele's, but the quality there is only satisfactory, too. All the good places are gone!

Surprisingly, all the non dumpling stuff is good! Tried their chive pancakes and beef pancakes, and DAMN! best I've had in a while. A special delight is tossed mung with clear noodle and sauce. Can't get this dish in many places and taste amazing. beware if you are allergic to peanuts. However good the other dishes were, I did not come for this. I came for dumplings!

The Mexican corn consisted of one grilled corn on the cob, topped with a cheese dressing and then coated in fried corn chips/nibs. The cheese dressing added a tangy profile to the sweet corn, while the fried bits provided a nice crunch and interesting texture. Overall, I did enjoy the corn; however, I do think that the corn could have been served hotter. It was quite cool when I received it, likely because they had pre-grilled the corn in anticipation of a large crowd or line up.

On Saturdays you actually eat outside as well under a couple of covered areas with no reserved tables, it gets crowded so hopefully you can snag a table. 

 I'm very picky about BBQ and this place was as good as any down South. The brisket was leaner and more tender than most, you could cut this stuff with a fork. The green beans were definitely homemade with potatoes, onions, and lots of ham. The BBQ beans were likewise quite tasty with a bit of a spicy flavor and included onions and peppers. The pulled pork might have been the best of all, it was lean and tender with a BBQ sauce with a spicy, slightly garlic flavor. Oh and this comes with a large cornbread muffin too. The portion sizes here are MASSIVE, I was hungry and still was able to eat maybe 3/4 my meal at best.

Made plans a month ago for this big night to see the new Mountain Shadows resort and what a disappointing experience it was. The ambiance has a very clinical, industrial  vibe, it does not exude warmth but the views Camelback Mountain and mummy Mountain are gorgeous. Our server I believe did her best as did the manager but the food is sub-par. My husband and i shared the heirloom tomato salad which was good; no complaints there. They then brought us out a complimentary tasting of a cold melon soup which was excellent. Then after waiting for the entree which seemed to take an extraordinary amount of time so much so that one of the manager bought us a round of drinks we finally got our entrees. My husband and I ordered the same thing the Saturday Special, Prime Rib, and it was inedible due to high intensity of salt, possibly due to the a very salty au jus being already poured on the steak. I thought that was a little unusual since most steakhouses serve it on the side. Another thing we found to be odd was first they bring you a whole slice of nice warm bread served with a pesto sauce; very good but when asked if we would like more bread the second of bread was just a half slice; strange. We also ordered the polenta also too salty to eat. Our friends had ordered the tomahawk steak at $120.00 (not $115 as listed on-line) and was promised that it would be cut table-side which he was thrilled with because he wanted to take a photo of the steak to show friends. His steak came out already cut. So he was very disappointed. He also said his fingerling potatoes were very salty. His wife got the cauliflower as her side and she loved that. My husband and I complained that we couldn't eat our prime rib and informed them of the saltiness of the polenta. We ordered 2 filet mignons medium rare and those took so long to come out our friends had finished their tomahawk before we got our steaks. Again the sauce on the side was salty so my husband couldn't finish his since his meat was seated further into the sauce than mine was but I can say the filets were perfectly cooked and tender.

Instead I ended up in a vulture circle around Southern and McClintock in the dreaded beige strip mall purgatory, trying to remember desperately which generic store front housed the soy-friendly Xtreme. Still groggy, I decided to ""fuck it"" and just do Starfucks.

 I parked in an extremely awkward spot near the taco place (I have no idea why) and while walking around the megaplex of suburbia, I saw...wrought iron cafe tables? What? Gold Bar? Espresso? Double WHAT? I wandered over there, it wavered in the sun like a desert mirage, and as I got closer I saw happy people of all types sitting in some awesome metal seating (very mod) conversing, smoking, drinking delicious looking cups of coffee. Going through the door, I saw a cozy, dark (but still well lit by sunlight) cafe with yummies in the display case and a friendly barista. They don't have any breakfast sandwiches, a big minus for me, but the bagel with butter and cream cheese I had was pretty damn bangin'. They also had soy, and made me a cafe mocha with soy-yummers! Delish! The total amount was around 6 something, which always feels strange for bagel and coffee when I could have gotten an actual breakfast for the cost...but then again the decaf coffee would have tasted like bum residue with dish soap. So there you have it. The owner was there and extremely friendly and apparently they have a website of guitar and jazz. What a happy place! And there were plenty of regulars relaxing or running in to get coffee while friends waited in the car in the ample parking lot. Totally glad I discovered this place so close by as well-yippie!

After repeated visits, I have to say I am just not as fond of this place. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS for coffee and food, and I don't feel like I get my moneys worth at all. It feels weird to sit in there and when its too cold to just sit outside and stare at a dying strip mall parking lot, I take it to go and walk around near by Kiswanis Park. 

I feel bad not hurrahing this place, but with Steves Espresso a block away and Tempe based indies Bunna Cafe and Three Roots vastly superior in price and quality (not to mention ambiance), I just say it is an alternative to Starbucks.

Since planting season has begun, I stopped by Canadian Tire to buy some topsoil, plants, and grass seeds for the lawn outside my house. Everything initially seemed routine: Topsoil was located outside the store, plants and grass seeds were located inside and in the garden centre.

When we got to the cashier, that's where everything just fell out of place. The person ahead of me had to get a barcode check, so I was served first. However, the pot of plants I purchased had no barcode, so I had to wait about 5 minutes for an employee to check the barcode. After everything was settled, I paid the amount, the cashier put the items in my cart, albeit disorganized, and I left and went home.

When I got home, I noticed something was missing: The grass seeds! I remembered when the cashier asked a store employee to check the barcode, she put the grass seeds in one corner and the topsoil in another. Holy hell, talk about lack of organization! Not to mention she didn't know how to retrieve a transaction. I understand she's new, but I would've imagined training cover that thoroughly.

The saving factor was when I returned, the cashier immediately recognized me and quickly gave back my grass seeds, after apologizing profusely. Fine, you admitted you were wrong and apologized. I had to be your typical Canadian and said sorry in return.

The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely, and the staff was very friendly. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the shredded chicken chimichanga. While we waited we helped ourselves to their chips and salsas. Now, I am very picky with chips and salsa, I really like fresh authentic Mexican food and can't stand things like pace picante and tostitos, sorry but no. The New Mexican Grill has awesome chips and salsa!!! Even though I usually like thinner chips, I really enjoyed theirs. Our food came out piping hot and everything was flavorful and moist, nothing was dried out, including the rice. Both the green and red hatch chilies were very tasty; i preferred the red and my boyfriend liked the green better. Also their prices were pretty fair so that's always a plus.

She became very busy the day I was there but she always checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed or wanted. She's funny and all around a good genuine person. Every server that passed by me always asked how I was doing and how my food was. Jessie one of the managers is the cherry on top of amazing service.

The cleanliness when we walked in was awesome! I loved that you are not presented with a harsh chemical smell right when you walk in. The sanitation is quite admirable at this place as well. The technicians do not reuse tools such as the emery board, buffer and foot scrub. Plus you get it as a little gift at the end of your manicure/pedicure which is nice.

Started with drinks at the bar, I think they're might have been a drop or two of cranberry juice the rest was pure Belvedere bliss!! After just one drink, it felt like I was floating to our very private, romantic window booth that overlooked the strip. Our waiter was fabulous and very helpful. We asked about the Kobe flat iron simply because we didn't know what it was and it was the only inexpensive cut on the menu. He explained it and we both knew it was not what we wanted. We went the filet mingon-you can't go wrong with the filet. And if your going to spend the money, you might as well spend ALL the money!! 

Everything is a la carte so when you order your cut that's all you get. We each ordered a side; truffle macaroni & cheese and butternut squash. Ok, the filet was delicious. Every bite melted in your mouth. We didn't order any of the rubs or sauces they offer-we just wanted pure beef in all it's glory. The filets were prepared to perfection. But I know it won't be the last perfect filet I eat so let's get back to those sides. The butternut squash was delicious. Tender, sweet with an ever so slight kick to it. Great veggie choice. The truffle mac & cheese was out of this world. To die for. The most amazing mac & cheese I've ever had or ever will have. It was rich and creamy. The truffles gave it the most unbelievable and luxurious flavor. Yes!! It was pure luxury. If mac & cheese were cars,  a box of kraft would be a moped from the late 70's and BOA's truffle mac & cheese is a Bugatti. 

Dessert did not disappoint. We ordered the special dessert-it may have been a Valentines special since we were there Valentines weekend. It was warm sugared doughnut holes with a Godiva heart in the middle served with warm caramel & vanilla sauces to dip these warm, doughy, sugary pieces of heaven into. It was so delish and the most perfect ending to a most perfect dinner. 

So the price of this dinner for just the two us-which was 2 drinks, 2 filets, 2 sides, 1 dessert + tip was just about $200. Yes, looking back that seems extreme, but that night and in that moment, it was worth every single penny. Everyone deserves a dinner like this, at least once a year.",2011-03-26 05:20:38

The flavor was much more delicate and you really taste the sweetness of the clams. The noodles were good but I didn't think they were amazing. I prefer my noodles more springy and chewy.  The pork was done well, just the right amount of meat to fat ratio. The other bits they add to flavor the soup really add a new dimension to ramen that is unique and made it a really interesting experience. (The shoyu tends to mask this though because of its intensity another reason why I like shio more).

Given that my bf and I don't see eye to eye on where to go (he likes K&B, I like Spoon and Fork) we decided on trying something new. Moon Sushi is fairly close to our house and we've been meaning to try it for quite some time. 

Upon first entering, it is a bit of a weird environment. It looks fairly similar to the Montfort that used to be in that spot. Also, if you aren't lucky enough to get a booth and are stuck at a small table, I would be concerned about how much you could order as they really were compact. Thankfully, we got a booth and ordered to our heart's content.

The selection was more than enough in my opinion as we ordered everything we could and yet still had some items that were left untasted, earmarked for next time. Our favourite items were the arctic roll, the beef skewers and anything eel. Everything seemed very fresh, no strange flavours or smells. It was all presented in a very professional manner. 

The paper ordering system kept it simple and they only forgot 1 item. And I didn't have room for any salmon belly after all the arctic roll i had eaten (3 whole rolls....). Bonus, it was less expensive than most other AYCE sushi places by at least $4 and their pop was $1.50 with refills. We will definitely be back.",2016-05-10 19:11:05

My fav was the cherry clams with the good catch blend (spicy and garlicy) with okra.

I found this place on BlogTO's list of best pumpkin pies. I can attest, this place has mind blowing pumpkin pie. I bought a pie for my partner (who had been craving pumpkin pie for weeks) and a a 10"" pumpkin tart for a Thanksgiving party.

I ordered on Thursday to pick up for Sunday morning (before Thanksgiving Monday). The tart is $20 and the pie is $7, and honestly they are so worth the money, especially the pie. I went in on Sunday. I don't live anywhere near this area, but it's very accessible by TTC. AND IT WAS HAPPENING! People were coming in to pick up baked goods for Thanksgiving, people were eating, people were coming in for pastries. It was so packed. But the staff were totally prepared and on top of everything.

I was in and out in no time. Very efficient service. And the goods...!!! The tart was a big hit for Thanksgiving. It had a bit of chocolate to it and was so pretty. Just the right bit of sweetness to it. The pie was divine. So creamy. I just wanted to keep eating it forever!

We regulars don't care though, it's already crowded enough.

You order at the front counter after perusing the menu choices on the wall to your right. You then proceed around the corner and grab your drink then move on to pay. Within minutes your meal is enthusiastically delivered piping hot to your table in its narrow alley-like eating area. Fries are simple yet fabulous as are all of its sides. Even its cookies are pretty darned good.

Back to the burgers though... long time locals know them for what they are, the absolute best burgers in the area. Served up simply, on a buttered then grilled bun, they focus on what matters most which is the Angus beef.

The Rubens and cheese steak Hoagies are served up just as simply and honestly. Crushed ice sodas only enhance the experience. 

Service is friendly and hustles to get your food to you hot and tasty.The joint is always clean and well managed. Is it a five star joint amongst comprable daily grills? You bet it is!

The service was standoffish, and though we ordered the things that were recommended in other reviews, I think we all walked away feeling like we were missing something. 

Actually, to be honest, my choice, the Rising Sun burger, was probably at about a four star. It was an interesting combo of avocado, crispy yam strips, furikake, and teriyaki sauce, However, the selections that my dining partners got hovered at about two stars... or maybe even lower. One of my friends got the lobster roll and proclaimed it the worst she'd ever had. 

Those who got the steak fries seemed to enjoy them, but I got the shoestring fries and found them to be cold and a bit stale tasting. Apparently the shakes were mighty tasty as well, though I wasn't feeling something heavy and dairy-laden that day so I passed.

It's too bad because all I wanted after a long night out was a fulfilling, tasty burger and other comfort food selections.

So, Taco Tonto's: Climb the concrete steps, shuffle around the stools and see the menu on the back wall. Wonder: Where do I order? Then notice that what you thought was just an opening from the kitchen to the dining area is, in fact, where orders are taken. Order, get your chips and salsa right away, and grab a stool by a narrow ledge to wait. The order of chips is massive and begin to realize you've overestimated your hunger.

Hear your name called and look around, confused. Walk up to the opening where you ordered and just see people busy cooking. Look through and see there's a window cut into the wall on the other side of the kitchen. Go back around to the entrance, down a short, narrow hallway, and find your order waiting. Or, at least, what you think is your order. Get somebody's attention and ask; yes, it's yours.

Grab your plasticware from the side of the soda machine, where there are also some slightly grubby-looking squirt bottles of hot sauce. 

Discover that the burrito is good -- but probably much better if it were late at night and you were a poor, starving college student. Realize that it's been many years since you were that.

I love that they have lots of different colors for the same shirt because sometimes it's nice to be able to buy a shirt you absolutely love in 3 different colours. They also have tons of them so you will most likely find your size unless the piece is highly in demand. Another good thing about this is that once you know your size in the shirt model you like, you can just pick it up in the same size without trying it on.

Most of their items are very cheap and very office/preppy friendly but they also have pyjamas and lougewear that is so soft and comfortable. 

When I went they were having a sale on most of their athletic wear (13$ for tank tops, shirts, shorts) and for the quality it truly is a steal. 

I just love the style they are going for. I don't usually reach for patterns and Uniqlo sticks to basic neutral colors with some flashy colours once in a while to mix it up. It's perfect to build your wardrobe. 

This location is gorgeous! So well lit, well stocked, clean, and big! Everything is laid out beautifully so you won't have trouble finding what you want. I wanted to buy the entire store TBH, The staff is also super nice and friendly. They even give you a basket when you enter, they know you'll be trying on a LOT of stuff.

When I told my boyfriend that this is the only store we had to visit in Toronto to make our trip worthwhile, he was skeptical. He didn't believe me when I said this store was the bomb.com. He quickly realized that I was right, the store is awesome, and he ended up buying more than me!

I highly recommended this place to out-of-towners, or just to people who had never been there.  

However, on my most recent (and third) visit, we noticed that this place had started to slip a bit.  It was very empty on a Saturday night - which probably isn't a good sign.  Despite how empty it was, the service was very slow and it took surprisingly long for simple items like a bowl of soup to arrive.  They'd done away with their cocktail list on their drink menu too.

So far, my foray into the food qualifies as so-so. They have good french fries but I don't think they are worth $7 a plate. I appreciate how they highlight the use of local ingredients in the food. I went for the Schreiner's sausage pasta which had penne and a smattering of seasonal vegetables covered in marinara. The dish was flavorful enough. On the one hand, I was happy that it was just the right portion. On the other, I thought there might be more for $16.

Pho Vistro is super nice when you walk in.  It has a hipster/bar vibe feel. They proudly show off that every thing is organic and locally bought.  A huge plus and I think their advantage point.  They even have a vegan option for pho (like damn, that's hard).

On weekends, the place is usually packed with Asians from all over the greater Cleveland area. However, seating is usually not a problem as this is a fairly large restaurant. 

Their dim sum selection features over 40+ items, ranging from the usual shrimp dumplings (har gow), pork dumping (siu mai), congee, to beef tendons and chicken feet (you should definitely try this, its tastier than it sounds!). The dim sum is served from carts that are pushed around the restaurant. Each cart has a different selection of dim sum dishes. You stop a cart and you make your selection. The dishes are tallied on the check. The dim sum is fresh and is made daily, but selection and freshness is definitely better on the weekends since its busier and more batches are made. My favorite dim sum dishes include the shrimp and pork dumplings, pork & egg congee, chicken feet, beef tendons, stuff eggplants, shrimp rice crepes,  and to finish off with egg tart custards and/or sweet soy bean pudding.

During dim sum, you don't really have a dedicated server. You can flag down any one of the servers to get what you want. Some server's are better with English than others, so communications can be an issue for non Chinese speakers.

The stuffed pizza was a small but it was almost as tall as it was wide. It looked good and we struggled to figure out a way to conquer it. Unfortunately, the dough didn't do it.

I had the opportunity to visit their new Mississauga location on a recent visit. The decor itself is exquisite, with beautifully appointed dining rooms that live up to expectations. The menu is somewhat varied, and reasonably priced.

After looking at their different steaks, I opted for the prime rib, prepared medium. We also chose a number of appetizers, including escargot stuffed mushrooms, steak bites and vegetable tempura. Of the three appetizers, the steak bites were the best - very tender chunks of beef with two different dipping sauces. (A steak appetizer before steaks? Why not?) The vegetable tempura was fine, nothing special. The stuffed mushrooms were the most disappointing. I couldn't really discern the mushrooms themselves - the dish is more of a mini mushroom-and-escargot casserole. 

The best word to describe the prime rib: flabby. It was a touch undercooked and very fatty. It was a bit of a challenge to cut through with my knife and that's not a good thing. It was also covered in a sauce that I would've rather had on the side. Having said that, it was very flavorful and I ate the whole thing.

We were so stuffed afterwards that we skipped dessert.

_GnKsiiG7klnRZfsY8q5hA,6btMczuTVuoJnmarbkWP_A,Gu-xs3NIQTj3Mj2xYoN2aw,3,1,0,1,"Maxim is a fusion restaurant where Western foods is served with a Chinese twist.

Seating was spacious and there was no line when I went on Saturday night with my family.
The parking lot isn't bad as well, although several other restaurants share the plaza.

Walking in you can see this huge display of cakes, which is honestly the most exciting part of the meal.

Ordering was simple as the menu was literally 10 items (or less). This was a minus for me as I feel like the options weren't diverse enough.

We were served by 3 different waiters which made it confusing but understandable as we were the only table in the right-sided area, while everybody else was seated in the main (left) side.  

Food came out pretty quick. The bread was heated before it was served which was appreciated.  Nobody likes cold bread.
The soup appetizer was okay.  I didn't really like the clam chowder as it was the easy, cheap kind to make.  The tomato soup was yummy and had the kick of heat I wanted.

I got the cod and scallop with rice.  The seafood itself was good but the rice was cold and had some hard pieces.  It felt like it was left over night and then served back to me :(

Everybody else enjoyed their meal pretty well.  
My family also ordered the:
- Lamb: this was a little too gamey, but the proportions were huge.
- Mixed grill: a lot, a lot of food.  To me they actually all tasted the same as they drenched it in the gravy but still not bad.
- Korean styled beef: lots of meat but too little rice.  The quality of the beef was good but I wished they filled the plate up instead of trying to make it look like the tiny French cuisine plates.

We got our drinks at the end which was a little strange for me.  Honey-lemon-iced tea is always a fave - just don't poke too hard at the lemon so everything turns bitter.  My mom loves their milk tea (lai cha).

The greatest part was the dessert:
Their meringue is famous and we order it every time it's my mom's birthday.  The ""shell"" is crispy but so flavorful with this nutty flavor.  It is FILLED with cream and fruits (mangoes or strawberries).  I wish they kept their quality with how much fruit they put in.  It's diminished quite a lot over the years.

Final Thoughts:
- First, yes I will definitely be back but maybe for only special occasions when I'm craving the cake.
- Second, they are so unorganized.  My mom ordered a cake to go to go for my sister's birthday (for after the meal).  When I was up looking at the display a little later the servers were like: oh what happened to the cake? We needed a whole cake.  Turns out somebody else sliced a piece of our cake off to serve to another customer.  Thank god they still had a small cake.
- Third, the waiters are a little short with service. Like: HERE, WHO GOT THIS? OK WHAT DO YOU WANT? Very Chinese style. But not rude.",2018-01-15 16:33:31

We ordered:
-Cold Jelly Fish ($5.88) - refreshing, the jellyfish is mixed in with pickled radishes and carrots
-Wonton Soup ($4.88) - came out piping hot, however SK offers a free house soup for lunch and dinner so I would skip over this and just eat the house soup
-Stir Fried Squid with Black Bean Sauce ($7.88) - squid saut√©ed with sweet onions, green bell peppers, and a flavorful black bean sauce 
-Braised Seafood Tofu Pot ($8.88) - came in a hot clay pot full of fish, shrimp, squid, and some of the most flavorful tofu I've ever eaten

After reading about DeMarco's on Yelp and just a few weeks after my recent trip to NYC where I did partake in a landmark  pizzeria ( Lombardi's ) , while getting my sweat on at the gym all I could think was , what time does DeMarco's close !?

Big surprise - cut the work out short , get out to my car and call in my order, "" if you can get here in fifteen minutes ..."". Hell yeah I can get there in fifteen !

Order small pizza with pepperoni and  sausage ( $11 ) and an order of Grandma's meatballs $12 

Pick it up and 20 minutes back home ... Food smells great - even before i get home,  i smell the basil , the pepperoni , of course I open the box and take a chunk of the crust - has a nice crunch, a little ""yeasty"" but I like it.  Sauce has a nice tang, it was cheesier than I expected but , again, it works for me.  The slight flaw is how they spread the pepperoni and sausage - both toppings tasted good but how hard is it to spread it evenly.  Overall, an awesome pizza.  I give it higher marks than Grimaldi's.

The meatballs were also impressive - might be a little pricey for what you get but man, they sure brought back memories of Mama's meatballs and yet a notch above my dear mama's sauce . 

I'm thinking i need a few more visits before i compare DeMarco's with Lombardi's, yes, I definitely need to do much more research !

I had never really paid much attention to LIB in past years. But after hearing this year's line-up, I was definitely excited to be able to attend.

Parking and getting around was surprisingly easy. There wasn't much traffic at all. Tip: Park in the City Hall parking garage. It's pretty close to where the shuttle buses will drop you off if you park elsewhere. (So you're not walking further.) Plus, it's $9 max Mon.-Fri. and just a $3 flat rate on Sat. and Sun. (So cheaper than a shuttle pass or pretty much parking anywhere else.)

I have to admit, doing all 3 days was a bit exhausting. And we didn't enter until late each day. And it wasn't due to drinking too much either. Perhaps we're just getting too too old. In the future, we will probably just choose one day and just get passes for one day.

I thought it was rather easily a 5-star festival. James O. said 3 stars, primarily because he didn't care for the lineup and thought the food and drinks were overpriced.

Pros:
- Great app! Easy to use and handy to have the schedule of everything at your finger tips.
- Easy entry and re-entry.
- Plenty of water available. (Bring your own empty water bottle.)
- Mostly friendly staff.
- Good layout and mix of art, music, and food in all different areas.
- Great lineup.
- Loved that it was right in downtown and not in some isolated dirt lot area.
- For the most part, acts didn't overlap each other, so you could easily stage hop and see every band you wanted to.
- Everything was on time! No tardiness or sudden changes.
- It was cool to be able to go into places, like some bars and the Container Park, that were actually inside the festival area. Tip: Take advantage of these areas as they have real bathrooms and not port-a-potties.
- Top chef food booths.
- So much cool art!
- All of the bands got pretty equitable time no matter where they fell in the lineup. (I've been to other festivals where bands in the middle of the day would only get like 20 minutes of stage time. Not the case here.)
- A good amount of rest and chill areas.

We had a total blast on day 1, when we arrived the earliest and had the least of a schedule. We just wandered around, tried all kinds of food, enjoyed some drinks, stopped at every booth, etc. It was a wonderful experience! Days 2 and 3 were more about the music with us hopping from one stage to another, which got to be pretty draining.

Cons:
- The Ambassador stage area had no large screens, so you couldn't see the performers unless you were up close.
- The bigger acts at the Ambassador stage drew such a crowd that the area didn't seem nearly large enough and/or those acts should've been on the Downtown stage.
- The Ambassador and Downtown stages seemed pretty far apart, which may totally make sense and be the best way to do it, but when it's the end of the day and you're exhausted, it's annoying.
- There was only one area with decent beer. And yes, all the drinks were overpriced. (But hey, that's pretty typical.)
- While it is the norm to put the biggest acts very last, it would've been nice to buck the norm and mix things up a bit more.

Overall, I had a great time and consider this one of the best music festivals I've been to.",2015-09-28 20:11:56

Thankfully, this one is the good one.  -glowing halo replacing devil horns on my head-

This is the flagship urban Loblaws Store and as such, I would expect nothing but the best here, at an already outstanding chain, and I am not left wanting.

The size is huge (my partner doesn't like coming here simply because I could literally spend the whole day shopping for groceries at this location).

They have everything available, including stuff that I simply wouldn't be able to find at a normal grocery store, stuff that I would typically need to go to a specialty or higher-end source for, like fresh oysters and shellfish, exotic fruits, seasonal greens & veggies, imported items, and high quality meats.

Staff are generally professional and very friendly, accommodating and helpful.  If anything, the only people problem I have are with some of the customers who are occasionally prissy and undeservingly snotty (invariably, these people wind up complaining about things that make it clear that they have no class whatsoever).  This just makes you appreciate the staff even more.

I've never had to park here (don't even know if they have parking), since it's effectively at the intersection of a subway line and a major streetcar route.

Sure things are a little pricier than they are elsewhere, but if you're going for value alone, that's what No Frills stores are for.  And if you don't know that you can find some items for a fraction of the price somewhere else, that's your own fault.

Everything is easy to find (except possibly for the frozen desserts which are divided between the main frozen foods section and a smallish freezer near the baked goods counter).

My one suggestion would be to adopt the same smaller profile double-decker carts you can find elsewhere.  This location does have double-decker carts, but the bottom basket sticks out like a full-sized one, but is offset from the back giving less capacity than a full-sized cart (I figure that they simply wanted to standardize on a single cart type that satisfies both large and small shopping trips, but somehow doesn't seem to satisfy either).

Any criticisms I have are minor, though.  This is, simply-put, the best grocery store I've ever been to.",2015-04-06 17:00:22

Indian Bowl Cuisine is located off Maryland right across from UNLV in the Chipotle shopping center. This small casual restaurant has plenty of seating and offers quick carry out. I ordered at the register, the owner piled in the food in a styrofoam tray, and I was on my way. I was in and out within 5 minutes.   

The lunch special comes with rice and one main entree. There's two different types of rice to choose from. I can only describe the rice I chose as tamarind rice. Most of the tray was filled up with this rice. For my entree, I got the Saag Aloo (potatoes with spinach in a spicy sauce). There was also Chana masala (a chickpea entree) as another vegetarian option. The potatoes weren't as soft as I'd like, but the spiciness level was perfect. I was going to order the vegetarian samosas but was told they take 10 minutes to make from scratch. Maybe next time.

Worth a Return Visit?
I'm glad to have another lunch option around UNLV, and I hope Indian Bowl Cuisine is successful. My meal was just okay, but super cheap! Can't beat a $4.99 lunch.

There was only one server for the whole place, yet the service wasn't too slow and she was attentive and friendly.  We decided on the crispy chicken and avocado burrito, and the Utopia burger and this was the veredict:

Utopia burger- tender, moist and delicious! It comes with the works (tomato,pickle,onion,green onion mayo) plus 3 cheeses ( I think they were asiago, cheddar and havarti) plus grilled veggies (eggplant,zuchinni and red peppers). It was huge! I had a hard time taking a bite because it was so loaded with toppings, I could barely get my mouth around it, and it came with crispy, golden french fries.

Crispy chicken avocado burrito- very good also, but the leafy greens  in it got soggy from all the sauce and mustard seed mayo it had in it, and I really don't like soggy lettuce. Otherwise, the chicken was crispy and had good flavour, and the avocado was creamy and delicious, all in all a really good combination. The burrito comes with rice and beans and your choice of either slaw or salad. I got the salad and it was good, though nothing exciting. Just greens with a balsamic vinagrette, the rice and beans were bland, and I couldn't bring myself to eat them.

The servings are really big, I cant immagine ever being able to eat a whole burrito, with rice,beans and salad. There are lots of options on the menu including meal sized salads, quesadillas, sandwiches, and a huge list of burritos and burgers. They also have a board with specials. 

I'm excited to come back here and try some of the other things on their menu, maybe one day we'll catch the hunky doctor here during his lunch break :)",2010-08-31 20:42:31

But the prices are ridiculous. There are very few options for less than nine dollars. Toast on the side was 2.59! My tea was 2.49! This is a turn off. Cost should be commensurate with time and expense.

The atmosphere is great here, nicely decorated with great lighting and seating.  Since this restaurant is known for their seafood, my friend and I order the regular lobster roll, the jumbo lobster roll and a lobster poutine (yes we had a lobster feast!).

Food took awhile to come but once arrived, they are displayed nicely. The smaller lobster roll also comes with side salad and fries. Lobster meat portion seems decent but I though the fries were a little over-fried.

My jumbo lobster was huge, although the bun it used is the exact same size as the regular one, but the jumbo has lobster meat overflow! But they used a little too much butter as eating it got a little messy.

Lobster poutine was interesting.  It was good portion but for some reason, the gravy was a little sour.  It didn't tasted bad, but it was very interesting as I never had sour gravy before (I hope it's not because it turned bad, but I didn't get a stomach ache from it).

I loved the buttery melt in your melt beef brisket. The ribs were fall of the bone. I loved how the sauce was on the side. I dont like saucy ribs! The fries were crispy and the fried chicken (boneless) was leagues better than KFC. 

Its $30 a person. A bit pricey IMO but worth it as a treat. Drinks were on the pricey side but to be expected I guess.

Service was on point. The atmosphere is hard to describe. Its dimly lit. The staff wear adidas sneakers. Our server was quick and efficient.

The restaurant has been closed since before Christmas, so we snagged a spot on the first night that they reopened for 2012. As soon as I walked in, I was impressed: the exposed stone walls, the decor, the chandeliers, the funky windows; it's absolutely quaint and gorgeous. The music went from r&b to reggae to everything in between and it never drowned out our conversation.

As soon as we sat down, Max, the raddest server in Montreal, came over to tell us about the cocktails of the evening. Every single ingredient is made in house and they are spectacular; so spectacular that we each had two.

After having those knock your socks off cocktails, we fully entrusted Max and told him to bring us whatever the most awesome 5 things on the menu are and we sat back and waited to see what he would surprise us with.

- raw striped bass: the pistachio and mint topping was incredible and the fish was absolute perfection. Best thing I have ever eaten, ever. No contest!
- albacore tuna: it was sooo amazing and the panko and roe topping were so tasty. Like the striped bass, it melted in your mouth and the taste of the fish wasn't drowned out by the toppings.
- rosemary and ricotta bread - never would have ordered this on our own but wow, it was incredible. The honey and the cheese drizzled on top were a perfect pair.
- Merlu et Palourdes/hake and clams: never before have I fought over brussel sprouts with a dinner partner but here, we did it and it was epic (and I got the last one, drenched in buttery delectable sauce)
- Skatefish and potato salad was also yummy. Had a breaded crust on the outside and was cooked just right. The salad had a ton of garlic and was jsut plain awesome.

And for dessert, I had the pineapple upside down cake. My dinner partner looked over and instantly regretted his chocolate ganache choice so I gave him a bite of my dessert, but only a tiny bit because I adore pineapple and I think this was the best dessert I have ever had in...my...life...

I was passing by Donut Hut late tonight and decided to drop in for my usual blueberry cake donut, which is always fluffy and sweet with that thin crispness on the outside. It's undoubtedly the 24/7 highlight of this shop. However, when I saw the owner move the glazed French crullers from the cooling rack to the display case, I realized that this was a potential opportunity for something special.

First thing when I got home: French cruller ($1.30). Unbelievable. Now I know that every single cruller that I've eaten before has been dry to some extent. It's slightly crunchy on the outside, but your teeth will quickly realize that it's through and through a soft, ridiculously moist, almost custardy interior. It's a delight.

Come to Donut Hut any day for blueberry cake donuts, but make a special stop late at night on the weekend and you just might find the magical cruller before it grows stale. (P.S. I definitely ate the cruller way too quickly for photos.)",2017-03-19 08:41:25

My love affair with milk teas and tapioca pearls will never end.  Morgan hit the nail on the head when she said they have few flavors.  I was surprised to see that there are less than 15 flavors on their menu.  What made it worse is that they don't have almond.  How can any Asian place NOT have almond flavor?  

I moved on and ordered the Taro milk tea with pearls.  For those that have never tasted Taro, it tastes quite a bit like pecan.  After I paid, I received my purple drink and ran out the door like a child with a new toy.  As I took my first sip, I was a bit shocked due to the sweetness.  Wow!  That was a lot of sugar.

My next trip, I ordered the honeydew at the suggestion of the associate behind the counter.  I told her that I wanted it less sweet.  She said she only put in a drop of the sugar compared to what they normally put in.  Amazing how the sugar can mask the flavor of the milk tea.  While I enjoyed the honeydew, it wasn't a flavor that I would crave.

On my third trip, I ordered the taro again and this time had them put in only a drop of sugar.  It was SO much better.  While I will never crave the taro, it will definitely help quell my need for milk teas.  Talking to the owner, I learned that the remaining flavors she carries are the flavors that actually sell in the area.  I wonder if she would order the almond or pineapple flavors for me if I paid for them?",2010-10-16 19:01:39

No bereavement breaks for loss of a loved one is a bummer here - they just allow you to change flights, dates for free or if you have to cancel there is generally no issue.
No first class which can be a good thing or bad thing I guess. Cashless flights, you will use your credit card to purchase food, alcohol, earbuds.

Firstly, this is a classic small plates restaurant (3 oz of your proteins). Those of you who enjoy Olive Garden endless pasta bowls need not apply. However, for an amazing journey of flavors spread over several small courses and an amazing wine list, come on in!

The place is not huge so I would recommend reservations during peak hours. We came in for a late dinner with a reservation and were seated at a nice sized booth. Winston is great as a server so ask for him if he's working; his knowledge of the menu and wines was very good. 

We had a hot and cold starter: the Lion's Paw scallop is wonderful and the sweet potato puree it's served on was a perfect compliment. I was worried how the pork confit would go with it but it was a very nice touch. Our cold starter was a special that night: a beef roulade stuffed with lobster and red peppers and topped with caviar. It was very good but the scallop stole the show in this course. 

Salads: We ordered the baby spinach and the organic field greens. The field greens with its interesting combination of the spiced caramel popcorn and blue cheese was very good but the baby spinah salad was phenomenal. I would come back just for this dish! A bed of perfect baby spinach topped with shallots and a warm sherry vinaigrette with large pieces of smoky bacon all topped with a perfectly poached egg and served with a crostini spread with pesto! So. Good. The salads were big enough for two to share one, I think. 

As a main course, I enjoyed the elk loin which was perfectly cooked at medium rare-rare and the boar risotto was nice. I enjoyed the brussel sprouts but thought my husbands celery root hash was better. He enjoyed the beef short rib which was amazing with its two generously sized poached crab legs. We did not leave overly stuffed but were very satisfied.

This is a pricey place at dinner and best for a special night but the food is so good! We will definitely be back!",2011-01-18 17:28:53

I ordered a pork chop for dinner and it comes with a pepper sauce (thankfully on the side).  I chose sides of mashed potatoes and buttered corn.  The corn had so much pepper in it you could almost not see the yellow.  It barely tasted like corn at all and I couldn't eat much of it.  Our server was exceptionally friendly although really slow to bring things like butter or water refills out.  She did bring fresh rolls because she took so long to bring the requested regular butter.  Apparently they were having a server meeting in the kitchen and you can't leave the meeting even if you have a guest requesting something.  I don't think that is a good practice at all - your guest requests should come before a staff meeting.  All the servers had to do a line dance of sorts during dinner also and it was pretty clear none of them were jazzed about having to do it.  Seemed kinda hokey - something more appropriate for a bar in Mexico than a restaurant in Phoenix.  But back to the food, my pork chop was absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes were very good also.  Only thing I would advise is lay off the pepper. And if your buttered corn is actually peppered corn, it should be advertised as such.",2017-12-20 17:30:04

Cute and cozy, IS SWEET is a great dessert getaway in the same complex as Viet Noodle Bar. 

Honey toast and cakes are plated with great presentation. 
Two popular desserts:
- 6.50 for crepe cake (Vanilla, matcha, or red velvet) 
- 4.00 for honey toast base, toppings range from .50 to 1.26
- big variety of coffee and hot tea available 

Small staff is very nice. IS SWEET has a small, family-owner vibe to it. 

This place barely missed the mark, but the honey toast was not cooked completely through after coming out of the freezer and still had that undone/overly chewy bread thing going on at some parts instead of being crisp and caramelized. 

Call me a 5 year old, but actually cutting a honey toast mountain with a butter knife is close to an act of God. Perhaps next time I'll BYO Knife, but at least there will definitely be a next time!",2016-06-28 13:34:24

Basically had to yell across the table to communicate. But the interior was cool and the kitchen is open for customers to watch the cooks put together your meal.

They have a nice large selection of alcohol. I ordered the flat iron steak cooked medium rare. It sat on a bed of roasted brussel sprouts and mushrooms. My steak was cooked beautifully and it was seasoned very well. My girlfriend ordered from the shortie side and had the chicken skewers which she too enjoyed.

Though I work in South Side Works, I haven't eaten here in over a year so I was happy to come back and get a fresh perspective of the restaurant, especially since my previous opinion was pretty indifferent. 

The customer service was good. A table for 10 was set up in a nice section of the restaurant before we arrived. We were promptly seated and had an efficient waitress. All went smoothly with service except confusion over who received which entree. Three co-workers ordered the same meal but with different substitutions, and each person received the wrong entree which resulted in some confusion and awkwardly passing plates of food around the table to correct the issue. 

I ordered the Ham & Brie sandwich with Blue Cheese and Apricot preserves and a side of Sweet Potato fries. The fries were very tasty - though is it possible to make Sweet Potato fries not tasty? - but I was disappointed in my sandwich. The bread had been toasted/grilled unevenly. One side was brown and crispy while the other side was mushy and buttery.  The sandwich was loaded with ham but only had a small slice of Brie. The blue cheese was nonexistent, and I could only taste the apricot preserves in a couple bites. 

I have a couple co-workers who are obsessed with the scallops and crab cakes here at McCormick... But as a restaurant option near many corporate offices, they should offer a great lunch.

In my most raw opinion, sushi is mediocre at its best. Period. So taking that into consideration, it was generously decent here. I tried their ""Mango Tango Salmon"" roll and didn't like it. I recommend getting fried/baked rolls because fresh sushi is hard to come by here in the desert lol 

Their Spicy Miso Ramen was also okay for me but I have been much spoiled in the city of Torrance, apparently ""Japan's sister city"" in California so you may want to give it a try.

The milk bread that is served right when you sit down is now and forever my favorite bread. The fluffiness combined with the salty crust is amazing. It was the perfect palette cleanser between courses. 

My mom and I started our meal with the first of the summer squash. Neither of us are huge squash people but we devoured it quickly. The buttery flavor was so rich but with a small portion size it wasn't overwhelming. Next we got the Scallops. They were served on top of corn and were seared perfectly. We then got the squid lettuce wraps. These were essentially Asian inspired calamari. They were light and a great in between course. Lastly we got a pasta that i cannot for the life of me remember the name of. It had a homemade tomato sauce that i wish i could recreate. I truly believe that this is a restaurant to step outside of your comfort zone because everything is going to be delicious.

I had a 4 meal prix fixe menu that was:

*Tuna tartare 3/5 Fresh & tasty No complaints but nothing extravagant 

*Ravioli with charred butter 3/5 Not bad but as above nothing i will remember

*Prime rib 1/2 This was not good at all. Looked like road kill and it was just lacking flavor. 

*Cheesecake with rasperrys 2/5 A step up from bad but you can get better at Cheesecake Factory at half the price. 

The price around 75 $ without wine and tip would have been fine with good food but the quality of food was not very good in my experience. I love evrything from a good burger , a meal at chain restaurant as Outback or exclusive high end food depending on my mood. 

This was below the Outback/TGI Friday/Cheesecake Factory etc in taste but with approx double the price. Not happy at all. 

Sevice was ok but nothing more. You really come here for the view wich is great but i recommend you going up in the tower, look at the view and then have a great dinner at The Keg or somewhere else.

Check-in lines were shorter than most of the other hotels we've stayed at in the past. We had to visit the check-in counter twice. The first employee had the personality of a potato sack and was not helpful, but the second was friendly and helpful. Paris also has self-serve kiosks for check-in and check-out. We used the kiosk for check-out and found it to be very simple. 

The room as mentioned, was clean and had plenty of space. It appeared that the room had been renovated recently. The bed was comfortable and we didn't have a lot of noise from rooms around us. The room included a basic coffee maker and an empty refrigerator versus a minibar. I'm always a happy camper when I can make my coffee first thing in the morning without wandering the entire property. 

There are a couple of lesser known shows on property. We saw Anthony Cools during our stay and thought it was a pretty funny show. There are several restaurants on property, Mon Ami Gabi is a great casual restaurant for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. We weren't wowed with Le Caf√© Ile St. Louis. A huge assortment of desserts can be found at Caf√© Belle Madeleine. Le Central is a nice spot to grab a drink in the middle of the action. 

The Paris has a pretty central location on The Strip and would be a nice spot to be for exploring in both directions. The self-parking garage is a hike from the check-in desk, but most this is the case for most Strip hotels. My only real gripe about Paris is the resort fee, coming in at around $37. This is more than we paid at places like Bellagio and Venetian (notably more impressive).

I'm not gonna lie, there was a stretch where my husband and I visited Mezzo once a month. My husband loves his Tuscan Tenderloin ($19) so much, he declared that it was his favorite meal ever. I myself prefer the Vegetable Lasagna ($15). It's loaded with squash, mushrooms, zucchini, and asparagus to name a few ingredients. More importantly, the Vegetable Lasagna is just dripping with cheese. Few Italian restaurants make a vegetarian lasagna (at least to my liking), so I have to get it while it's hot! I'd also highly recommend the Insalata Salad ($5). It's huge, fresh, and unique. 

As much as I'd like to give Mezzo 5 stars, I have to knock 'em down by one due to service. The service is inconsistent at Mezzo and your experience depends on which waiter you get.

He suggested Moreno's, not only for the dog but good Mexican food in general. 

I was not disappointed, only $3.25 for the best Sonoran dog I have had yet but the asada street taco combo was also solid. I am so glad my co-worker told me about Moreno's because I have been driving by it everyday for the past 3 years wondering if the food was any good.

I ordered the Edamame, Nabeyaki Udon and WTF (Sea Bass Tempura) roll.  She ordered the yellowtail sushimi lunch.  The Nabeyaki Udon tasted like soy sauce mixed with water microwave heated.  The soup was inedible.  Not sure how anyone could eat that.  I ended up trying to find the few pieces of shrimp and scallops in the soup.  That tasted like it was quickly like it was quickly thawed from something that was stored in the freezer for way too long.  Maybe they should hire someone who knows what they are doing.  Never order Udon from this place.  I can make 10 times better Udon broth at home.

The WTF Roll was good.  I actually liked it.  I would give the WTF Roll 4 stars by itself.

On Monday, we tried Vietnam Grille (delicious!)  But by Thursday we were still in the mood for more Vietnamese, so last night we checked out Saigon Palace about 4 blocks from VG.  I'm happy to say that our food was pretty much on par with VG, and my boyfriend actually preferred his pho at SP.  We got almost exactly the same thing that we did at Vietnam Grille so we could compare: he got pho with brisket and steak, and I got bun with chicken and a spring roll.  We started the meal with fresh spring rolls wrapped in rice paper and served with peanut sauce--it wasn't my favorite and I probably wouldn't get them again.  But when the entrees came out--watch out!  The pho had cilantro, which I missed from VG, and the meat was done perfectly.  Only one fatty piece, which is pretty good.  I loved my bun even more, which had a lot of chicken (more than VG), well seasoned and tasty, and the sauce that came with it (mirin with some other things) we mixed with hoisin and soy, and it was delicious.  And we both had enough for leftovers!

I thought nothing could steal my love for the dahlpuri roti that my trini neighbour made for me thoughout my childhood, but I didn't know the Indians outside of the Caribbean were bringing together favourites like saag paneer and butter chicken with the magic of roti pastry! 

Both restaurants offer the same mouthwatering choices, gargantuan servings and fresh from the kitchen goodness. Mother India has less business after work, so it's a little more pleasant to visit if you don't like being squeezed together with other hungry strangers. Service is quick at both sites. The dining room at Mother India does not invite you to linger. It reminds me of a church basement (keep thinking someone will yell 'BINGO!').  I think the staff like having the place to themselves,

Lots of organic produce & meats.  Prices on these items are reasonable & generally cheaper than most other organic grocery stores.

I have come to like so many of the Trader Joe branded products, that I have geared my shopping to this store & it's close proximity to another small-volume grocery store.

The wine sampling/tasting is usually fun and very social.  Most of the patrons act like it is an exclusive wine bar. Most enjoyable.

The staff are friendly and helpful.  It does seem rushed when shopping in this little store, kind of a frenzied atmosphere, most of the time.  The parking lot is also busy since the parking spaces, right in front of the store, are also pass-through roads from Washington & Buffalo.

I went with one other person for dinner and had an experience that made sure I won't be going back. When I called to make a reservation at 7, they said they could only accept at 645.

The bean soup lacked flavor, the pork rag√∫ was not a cohesive dish, and the chicken didn't match the description on the menu. The person who brought out the dish was rude when we asked why the description didn't match the plate. Also, the pasta under the chicken had a unidentifiable kick that was not addressed on the menu. 

Waiting for someone to check on us so we could get the bill took 15 minutes. Finally we were able to reach the bus person who was helpful and the manager brought over the bill. He apologized and offered to bring out a brownie when all we wanted to do was leave.

They do tend to be higher than other rental cars as the date get closer but if you book early enough then it's one of the cheapest places you can find. AND they always have new cars so you never have to worry about getting something crappy. 
My recent experience with avis however is the cause for the lower rating. I made a reservation using an ATT employee discount code and the total came out to be $183. I have used this code for many years and MANY rentals with no issues in the past. When I got to the location they told me that they could not honor the total because I did not have my aunt with me to show her ATT employee badge. My total ended up shooting to $350 because they were charging me ""day of"" rates. 
I understand that maybe they have a new policy for people showing their employee badges to use the code but I just wish that the representative at the counter was able to  help me out a little bit, seeing that the total was almost twice the amount I was initially planning to pay. 
Then to make matters worse, I get downstairs and into the car that was parked in the marked space for my reservation. I'm sitting in the car trying to adjust my mirrors and figure out controls when I get a tap on the window of a lady claiming that I'm in her car that she reserved.

First off, this is tucked away in a building that comprises of a food court near OCAD. It wasn't easy to find but definitely a hidden gem. Tables are mostly for 2. We came at 6:30 on a weeknight and got a seat immediately.
The prices are insanely cheap, for a limited topping udon, you can get away with under $5 including tax & tip. They have a variety of Japanese staples like curry, oden and gyu don. (Their physical menus are kinda gross so you might be better off looking at what you might want on yelp if you are a germaphobe)
My sister and I ordered the gyu don and a niku udon with beef. The soup of my udon is light but flavourful, everything you'd expect at a Japanese family restaurant. The beef seemed slightly over cooked but still very good quality. Both portions are decent, but I regret not trying their sides, since there was quite a bit to choose from.

*first, the waiter grabbed a high chair for my toddler and he wiggled it a ton before asking me if it was ok. Ummm, dude. If it shakes, do you think it's safe to put a kid in it? He didn't even offer to get a different one. 

*second, his accent was super thick. That wasn't really the problem, but it def made it hard to order. Mostly it was that that he was way pushy about ordering appetizers for our kids, and he gave us like 30 secs btwn figuring out how to order and asking us about drinks. It was a bit irritating. 

*once we ordered, it was mass confusion. We got a couple things ordered, but he kept interjecting suggestions (I think) or just commenting. I don't know. We originally only wanted 3 entrees, one for the kids to share and 1 each for my hubs and I. But somehow we ended up with 4 dishes, 3 rices, 2 orders of naan--even though I thought he said to us to only order 1 (which I thought was what he was bringing). It was confusing, and the waiter was unapologetic about the confusion when I said he misunderstood me or I him. He basically kept saying ""you ordered it. You ordered it."" Errr...no dude. I didn't. I said I wanted his suggestion for a tandoori dish after I said I wanted a tandoori chicken--not that I wanted both a tandoori chicken and a 2nd dish. Lesson learned: have the guy repeat your order back.

Also, that wiggly unsafe high chair was just put back in the pile. He didn't even wipe it down after my toddler smeared goober hands all over it. Cmon!

Again, food was very good. But order it to go, cuz the service sucks. Or go with the notion that you see your ticket b4 it goes thru. Cuz what I thought was gonna be a $30 meal with our gift certificate ended up being $70!!! Dumb! We won't be back, cuz I just didn't like the stink eye I got from the waiter on the way out. Dude! We still paid for all that extra food, and you got a tip you ass.",2015-04-10 04:29:24

My word of mouth for Little Saigon is get some of this food in your mouth.  I was with Mark R. today, but I may bring my wife here on a date.  The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable.    

I did the goi-cuon-chay and then mi-xao-me.  I asked then to make the stir-fry noodles (mi-xao) extra spicy, but it was medium at best. The red chili paste on the table made it easy to add heat, so no problem there.  

Digression: The spice issue brings out one of my double standards.  I want authentic ethnic food but, not authentic atmosphere.  Anyone else who has been outside the resort in a third world country should agree.

In9IaWJlNEGe6SkWkM0zqg,-hUgrj7Lzir3yLUYrMYQ4g,XiXu6WHbDoopKpeg7DfKdQ,3,2,2,2,"You'd probably miss this place unless you were actually in the plaza.  Personally the only reason I found it is because the Metro hadn't opened yet.  If you look towards Eglinton from the parking lot you'll notice a small building, yup... that's Coffee Culture.

It's pretty much what you're expecting about a coffee cafe, chairs, coffee, soups, couches and the best thing about this place... a fireplace.  Although it's in a little nook, those that do take advantage of the premium fireplace seats will be rewarded with a cozy electric fireplace and a big lcd hanging on the wall above it.

This coffee spot has it's normal varieties; the menu carries muffins, sandwiches, soups and bagels, oh and coffee and tea.  I got a cup of coffee and an english muffin sandwich with sausage.

Personally I don't think the sandwich was all too amazing by itself, but the thing that made it stand out was that they panini pressed it.  What a great idea!  All breakfast sandwiches from this point forth should be panini pressed.  That's right, McDonalds, Timmys and others... panini press investment, STAT.

Otherwise, the coffee was actually quite good.  Better than most of your other coffee slinging joints, but again not amazing.

I wish this place was in my building instead of what is there right now... which will remain nameless.",2011-01-20 14:17:11

French Market Buffet gets a 3.5 stars...almost a 4 star for the fact that they send me discount coupons almost every month.  Join the Club Coast player's club for free and watch the coupons come in the mail!  Seriously...we've been going here the past few months at least once a month because I keep getting a $10 off coupon...Save money...Live better! 

This buffet at the Orleans is your average Las Vegas food standard...cheap eats...and lots of it!  Now I know this is no quality buffet like The Bellagio, but in today's economy and the want to eat out every once in a while...this place fills a great need.   French Market features 'cuisine' featuring American, Italian, Mongolian, BBQ, Mexican, Chinese, and Seafood.  They have 2 big salad bars with your standard veggie fare, and a decent dessert station as well.

Lots of Asian folks like myself come here for the daily all-you-can-eat crawfish at lunch and dinner, price-wise I can see the appeal.  I mean folks everywhere here have mounds of crawfish on their plate...sucking away.  I am not the biggest fan of crawfish...too much work for too little meat.  It's just funny to see people sucking their hardest to get something out of a crawfishs' rear end!

I stick to my favorite at this place, the beef ribs!  Not many buffets in Vegas serve beef ribs.  When they are fresh from the grill and slathered with a bit of sauce they are so good!  I end up almost having a half slab of these things everytime (that's a good 5 or 6 bones).  I also like the Mongolian stir fry, although it's a bit strange because the Chinese section does stir fry as well.  I go back and forth, depending on the fresh veggies going in the stir fry in each section.  Pick your veggies, then let the chef know if you want beef, chicken, or shrimp and it's cooked to order for you.  I make enough to share!

Most of the food at the buffet is not bad if you know how to choose food that is fresh.  Remember, food sitting for too long under a heat lamp is pilau (yucky)...always take from trays that have just been switched out!  Looks fresher will taste fresher.  I also like their rotisserie, they make a pretty good roasted chicken...very tender and moist.

The dessert bar is fairly stocked, with your average pies and cakes, jello, and soft-serve machine.  But they now serve gelato which makes the dessert much more appealing.  My fav flavors are mango (yum yum), coconut, pineapple, and passion fruit.  They have about a dozen different flavors everyday.  Try em' all!

Dinner is not much different from lunch.  They serve a lot of the same things but they do have specialty nights.  Wednesday is steak night, Friday is seafood night, and Sunday is rib night.  But the one thing I love at their dinner is the osso bucco in the Italian section...so magnifique!  I eat bowls of the stuff when it is served, so rustic.

Pricing is the saving grace of this place and probably why it's always busy.  Breakfast starts at $6.49, lunch is $7.49, and dinner most nights is $12.99.  On Friday seafood night, dinner runs $17.99 because of the hot crab legs.  They also run an all day buffet special now...eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the low price of $21! !  What a steal!  It's $25 on Fridays though because of the seafood night.  But to be fed all day for $21 is a great deal if you're in Vegas for the weekend but short on cash.  If you had the Club Coast card and the $10 off coupon from the mail, you eat all day for only $11!  You can't tell me that's not a great deal even if the food is just ok!  Only in Vegas baby!",2010-01-29 18:32:57

As I was cashing out, I glanced at a flickering light on the TV for not even a half second and this next guy (VERY smug) tapped on the debit machine for me to hurry up.  That's so rude and it bothered me even more because I added a tip.  Once he SAW the tip, his tune changed. So RUDE and SMUG. Lets hope he tripped up the steps after his stupid shift.

The pistachio cheesecake is their most popular flavor and I wont take that away from them but I felt it was a huge MEH.  Like, what was I suppose to taste? Pistachios? Cuz I didn't.

 The red velvet on the other hand, was great!  You know why? I hate it when cheesecake is just dry and without whipped cream or strawberry or caramel sauce and the red velvet was moist and curbed all that dense cheesecake. 

Overall, $7 for a slice of the red velvet = yes but for the pistachio flavor??? No/never again. I wanna say I'll be back but I'd have to bring whip cream or strawberry sauce.

The Poke appetizer was light and delicious. The scallops (which usually are not my favorite) were divine in the truffle oil and the scampi were huge. The Mac and cheese was the right blend of cheesy and creamy with just a hint of spicy. Had to get the brookie as well for desert topped with salted caramel ice cream.

Intense shoyu clam broth ramen - Comes with 2 thin slices of sous vide pork.  Broth is flavour but not quite intense.  The truffle oil adds a nice flavour to the entire bowl.  Broth is not overly salty  but I think it could use a little more flavour even.

Karaage - Never had such tender chicken in this form before.  The four prices were soft and lightly battered.  The wasabi may complemented each bite very nicely.

Island Style

I went to the Island Style booth, same owners as the Island Style that is on Sahara and Valley view. 
I had #2 Bibimdaemyeun- cold buckwheat noodles in a spicy sauce with sliced pickled radishes and cucumber, brisket and a hardboiled egg. they have me two banchan of cabbage and a radish kimchee and a bowl of broth, seaweed I think. All that and a Hawaiian Sun Lillikoi can for $10. It was delicious- this is one of my favorite Korean dishes specially on a hot day. Actually cools you down quite a bit while heating you up with the chili! Chewy buckwheat and crisp veggies is such a great texture combo too. Island flavor also gives you complimentary, serve yourself barley tea and water. It's great for when I eat spicy- I'm drinking up cups in a single gulp! 

Will be eating at this food court quite often since I work close by now. Other than Island Flavor there is a Noodle Village, Chapaghetti, namyriang. 3 more booths are coming soon. The court also has L'Epidor Bakery, a cellphone place, a clothing store and a Korean cosmetics place.

Mr. Colorfood 6/25
I tried another booth, the most recently opened Mr. Colorfood. Got to-go order of ""Happy Pig Pork and Squid"" which comes in a spicy sauce and they gave me a side order of a miso soup, spicy pickled radish and sweet vinegar pickled radish and cucumbers for $10.50. It was a bit disappointing....usually this dish comes in a thick spicy paste and this was more watery. It also had this herb that is okay in some dishes, but I don't know if I like it in this and the squid had an odd texture...it was soft in a way that the outside of it was brittle/mushy that I can't really describe. I dunno, but I'm not sure about this booth....3 stars for that.

*****
Island Style 7/1
 Got beef bimbimbap from Island Style....yummy and generously sized! Lots and Lots of veggies (garlic spinach!, carrots), pickles (radish) and banchan (kimchee and radish on the side). I could not finish so I saved the rest for later. Still my favorite booth- 5 stars

Chapaghetti 7/16
I got jajangmyun which is black bean paste noodles. It has in it egg noodles, zucchini, cabbage, potato, onion and diced pork. It was pretty good, the sauce was savory (some places make it too sweet). There was mostly onions, with a little more meat/veggie and a thicker sauce it would be absolutely perfect. 4 stars.

Lets put that it's 3 stars since now I'm cautious even though it was a good cake.

Island Style 8/25
Got Chicken Teriyaki to go. Nice flavors, good char, but needed a sauce. I dont know if it usually has one and they forgot to include a cup of it One thing that was off though was the macaroni- it was frozen and the parts that  were not was a yucky texture since it defrosted. 3 stars. 
***
Noodle Village 9/7
Got the ""spicy noodles with vegetable"". It is very like my favorite Bibimdaemyeun but the noodles are thicker (spaghetti width) and has sliced cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, and half a hardboiled egg. They give you some daan moo ji/ sweetyellow pickled radish on the side. 4 stars. 
Just a note- Mr. Colorfood and Namyriang are now CLOSED. Tiffany Coffee will have a frozen yogurt booth coming soon.

I Love Oishi 10/6

This is the newest booth  in the food court.I got their Korean Style Jirashi bowl to go. It has mixed diced fish (tuna, salmon, and snapper it looked like), some masago roe, mixed greens, rice and spicy bean paste. They also give you miso soup with it. This was a lot better than the premade ones in the greenland deli since it's fresh made. The fish and greens were all fresh and for $7.99 it was a good portion of food. 4 stars.

Just a note- Mr. Colorfoods old booth has a sign for ""School Food"" coming soon....what an odd name! Curious to see what the food is like.

I Love Oishi 10/26

Sushi and Sashimi Bento $9.99 It had salmon sashimi, 4pc nigiri (shrimp. tuna, white fish, salmon) , grilled salmon collar, salad, potato crochette and miso soup. It's a good light lunch. The salmon was very fresh but the other sushi is just ok. The grilled collar was great. I rather have rice than the crochette though. 3 stars. I still think the Korean Jirashi is the dish to get here.

The rising sun is an Asian fusion burger made of kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado; a lot goin on - I wasn't impressed. The shake was delicious.

I like the fact that they offer late night bites. However, there are just too many other great burger places to choose from. Holsteins falls flat. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing; it came highly recommended by our server. Regardless, I don't need to spend another $18 on a burger here only to be disappointed and unfulfilled again.

As we were waiting for our food to arrive, we were entertained that it seemed like everyone knew everyone and no one was speaking English. This though makes me feel excited as it can only mean authentic food.

I saw on the menu that you can get for $3 AYCE of the salads which consisted of hummus, baba ganoush, a vinegar based slaw, carrot and cauliflower pickles, pickled peppers, cucumber tomato salad, onions with sumac, red cabbage salad All of them were good, fresh and seasoned well. The hummus and baba is really good and would cost you a lot more than $3 anywhere else for a single serving of one of them. 

BF and I got the falafel pita (I believe $6.99). Once they stuff them in the pocket they ask you what else you want in it (basically from the salads I mentioned above) along with options for garlic sauce and hot sauce as well. The seasoning on the falafel was good and they were lightly crunchy and soft inside. I prefer more soft than crunchy like chips so it made me quite happy and the pita was fluffy and everything I think good bread should be. Both the BF and I are huge fans of the falafel at Amenas and this is really good that they are equal contenders for the top pocket. 

There was a bit of confusion (language barrier?) as to the salad sampler but eventually I got a little plate to try them and the lady was really sweet anyways.

 I definitely will be back again to have more of this falafel and maybe try other offerings on the menu. I think this little hole in the wall is a must try if you like Mediterranean fare.",2012-02-12 23:10:13

No way, I going to pay that much for a Ramen in Toronto, Richmond Hill at a FTR places! :P So I settle for the cheapest Ramen which is NOT even on the Menu! 

Jyuban Ramen ($5.95) 
- Ramen in chicken soy sauce with pork and some veggie 
- The waitress comment that it will be smaller than their regular Ramen but I told her is the perfect size for me 
- The broth I tasted more soy than the chicken..and I expect it to be saltiness and it is really salty... 
- 2 little piece of cold pork floating in my little Ramen... 
- the noodle itself, was cooked al dente.. though quite good..( in their menu, they emphasis how good their in house made noodles are!!) 

Rice cake with Pork ($2.50 if order alone with a noodle is $1.50) 
- I will be really upset if I pay $2.50 for that! even at $1.50 really not worth it!! 
- The pork inside was really really dry.. at first I thought it was those preserved shredded dried pork they sold in the supermarket.. 
- The rice has no taste at all... and the pork not juicy.. so SKIP!!!!

The fried rice option for the combos is PORK fried rice only.  You can't get regular fried rice.  The pork didn't really go well with the beef, although I'm not sure it was beef.  The fried rice itself was very dried out.  The combo meal consists of a choice of entrees for lunch, plus pork fried rice, lo mein and one other option.

It can be a bit pricey, but the restaurant is BYOB, but with a steep $5.00 per bottle corkage fee. There are two liquor stores within walking distance. There are also several bars where you could get six-packs of beer, so I don't know why the BYOB policy (a standard in liquor-license stingy Pittsburgh) is mentioned as a problem for some reviewers.

You get all three apps, and then you get 3 tacos of your choice and a dessert. I got two pork belly tacos and one brisket taco. The brisket was great (spicy, with the addition of chipotle cole slaw), but the shining stars of the meal were the pork belly tacos. The meat was crispy on the outside, juicy & tender on the inside, and just outstandingly... porky. The toppings of avocado and pickled onions added just the right acidity and creaminess to balance the crispy richness of the pork. Winner!

First off we were pleasently greated by every waitress and hostess.    Once we were seated we looked at the menu and drooled over each and every nacho choice.  based on the reviews we were expecting poorly made nachos and processed cheese on our BBQ pulled pork nachos.  Instead they came with crisp, lightly salted chips and an excellent melted cheese sauce.  The flavor was perfect and the pork was very tender.  We also ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos.  The beans and rice were bland but the fish tacos were excellent if slightly underseasoned.  The children's menu is extensive and offers a huge bean and rice burrito, quesadillas, and tacos to go with the usual hot dog and burger fare.

When we went in on Sunday and learned about the name change the girl working told me that they are no longer part of the Orange Leaf franchise, but the owner and the products are the same. So I was disappointed that my 10 punches that would have given me a free yogurt a few weeks ago got me only 10 points toward the required 30 points needed to get a dollar off future purchases. If it was the same owner, why wouldn't he honor the previous deals that they had offered?

I did get a text message once I signed up for their program, offering me a BOGO to be used in the next 2 weeks. The yogurt and toppings have not changed, so I'm still a fan of that. 

Finally, they either raised the prices or the girl charged us wrong. The cash register was not hooked up to the scale and she had to work it out on a calculator But for our 2 small and 1 large yogurts the price was $15.

TIABI has been over on Maryland near Flamingo for a quite a while now. Maybe it's just out of sight, out of mind for me (since I haven't been to neighboring restaurants like Sakana that often), but it's certainly not too far from one of my workplaces. I was able to stop by for lunch to try their menu at long last.

They seem to be having some issues with music skipping (streaming lag perhaps), but it's a pretty quiet place either way with plenty of seating for studying or just enjoying food and drink. Baristas have all been friendly so far, and it was easy to use the Groupons that I'd recently purchased.

The iced Snickers coffee ($3.35 for 20 oz large size) is appealing, even mildly addictive. Although it doesn't perfectly capture the peanut-y essence of the candy bar, its chocolate and hazelnut combo are a reasonably sweet flavor fusion that provide both fuel and happiness. Plus, it's quite reasonably priced compared to other places.

The West Coast waffle sandwich ($6.59) is an obvious choice for a savory lunch. I was pleased first and foremost by the lightly crispy and spongy, fluffy waffle that's creased so that you can just pick it up. The chicken and bacon satisfied my carnivorous sensibilities. The delicious, fresh veggies (avocado, tomato) brightened the dish up. Finally, although the sauce wasn't that distinctive alone, it served as a perfect complement. Nothing was limp about any of this.

I went for the Pumpkin Truffle Latte ($4.65 for a large) on my second visit, opting for hot rather than iced. What a treat. It's a perfectly sweet, creamy drink with a moderate spice accent, and I wish it wasn't just a seasonal item. Maybe if I just ask nicely and bat my eyes, it won't be just seasonal? It's the drink that has finally sold me on that whole annual fad.

I also had the seasonal Zombie Waffle ($6.50). This red velvet waffle has bacon cooked on the inside. I had to ask because they're not immediately visible, but using a knife (obtainable at a station near the counter) to cut and even cross-section the waffle, I saw the thin fatty strips. This dough otherwise had the same texture as my wafflewich, which means it rocked. Flavor-wise, it's actually mostly savory, with the chocolate syrup drizzle serving more to accentuate the red velvet batter than to tilt the balance toward sweetness. This also needs to be a year-round treat.

TIABI has impressed me so much on my two visits that I wish I hadn't been so apathetic before. It's a great spot for caffeine and fuel to carry you through the day, and I'll be back even after I use the last of my Groupon 3-pack.",2016-10-30 01:10:42

When ordering takeout everything was quickly done and excellent again! I loved the ""Green Garden"" dish with steamed veggies. My mother ordered Pad Thai, spice and it was perfect.

The environment, food & service was good, but I do not understand what the buzz & rave reviews are about!

We arrived at about 9PM on a Wednesday & were promptly seated in the restaurant section (we could have sat in the bar or lounge area, but both were a little too noisy for us).    

I ordered a chocolate milkshake ($9) the ""Urth"" burger ($13) plus cheddar cheese ($2), mushrooms ($2) & grilled onions ($2) and for an extra $2 I could upgrade from fries to onion rings, so I did that as well.

My friend ordered the Executive burger, cooked medium, and a water.

Service was good -- not great, not bad, but OK/good.

Ambiance -- casual attire by both guests as well as waitstaff, a little artsy architecture, numerous TVs on the walls.  Nothing pretentious, nor elegant.

Food -- My $9 chocolate shake didn't taste any different than a McDonalds chocolate shake, other than that it came with some whipped cream on the top (sorry, no cherry) & a little extra in a metal cup, old-school style.
My burger was great, but $19 great? Absolutely not.  I could have loaded-up at 5 Guys or In & Out burger and been just as happy with my burger, for a lot less $.   As for the onion rings, they were good, but not great, and on-par with a fresh order of onion rings you might get from Burger King!

My friend said his burger was good (not great...) despite it clearly being medium-rare, not the medium he ordered.

Total bill came to $50, + $10 tip = $60 for two, no alcohol & my friend just drinking water.

I realize Holstein's is in the Cosmopolitan & probably pays a lot of rent, but to the customer, that fact alone shouldn't justify the high prices -- better quality, better service, better interior design are needed there.

Am I glad I finally got around to trying Holstein's?  Sure!  Will I go back? Only if friends want to try it, but I'll try steering them elsewhere first.   We will certainly wander around the Cosmo and be awed by the high-class, sometimes ostentatious scenery, but if we're not on some sort of expense account, we'll go elsewhere for dinner.   Prices are the same or slightly higher at BurGR in Planet Hollywood but the service, atmosphere, & quality (such as the house-made buns & ketchup) are much better.",2014-10-16 10:20:30

It is located downtown a few blocks from the Fremont Street area.  The museum has only been open a few months and everything appears new and in working order.  It is divided into three sections over three floors.  It begins with a history of the mob segues into the history of Las Vegas, through prohibition and World War II and beyond.

I would estimate to fully take in the information will take about three to four hours and is well worth the time.  

I must say that I learned quite a bit from the museum and was surprised that they were able to acquire the artifacts used to tell the story.  The use of media also helped to explain the story of the mob.   The fact that the museum is in Las Vegas helps the visitor to absorb the experience closer to the source.

I would give this place one star; however, the decor was nice and the location is handy for a ""dinner and a movie"" night. (but not handy enough to warrant coming back.....)

The prices were alright, I would expect things to be a little cheaper based on a few things though:
.The food was mediocre to bland
.The ordering at the counter, yet having a ""server"" rushing around tables
like he was in some sort of relay race is just obnoxious.
.No one welcomed us upon entering, after a couple minutes someone
asked if we were ready to order or if we needed to look at the board
longer

1/4 way through our experience here, we felt like we had already been ripped off.  The food really was nothing exciting at all.  The place itself appears to be in some sort of identity crisis. I mean is it counter service or sit down? You can't be both, it just annoys people.

Having said that, what you should also know is that if you prefer to watch a movie completely uninterrupted, this may not be where you want to watch it. You will notice the servers moving around, taking people's orders, bringing out the food & check etc. They try to be as invisible as possible - wearing black, and speaking softly, but we're so accustomed to not seeing figures move around in a dark movie theater, that it can be somewhat distracting. 
The food was good - the appetizers especially. I ordered a salad (kale and avocado) for my main course, which I didn't love, and also, it wasn't the ideal dish to eat in a dark theater.. I wish I'd have realized that when I ordered it, then I wouldn't have eaten half of my husband's burger, which was quite tasty =). In my opinion, dishes like their delicious coconut chicken tenders or pizzas, are far better choices for that setting. While the theater itself is definitely more suitable for a date, (thanks to the ambiance and seat arrangements), the bar is a fun place for bigger groups.

I don't even really like pizza.  But I LOVED this pizza.  I'd heard about this place, what with the POTUS getting VIP delivery and all, and was pretty intrigued.  What's so great about a pizza place?  Well, let me tell you!  The...red...sauce.  Seriously.  It's probably the tastiest sauce I've tried.  We had some on the eggplant appetizer (tasty and perfectly fried) and on the Big Apple pizza.  Read on, pizza lovers, and try not salivate!

- Big Apple pizza: red sauce with all sorts of meat.  The sausage is a-ma-zing.  I picked all of it off and my husband got really mad at me.  Hehehehe.

- White Truffle pizza: I love me some mushrooms.  But I must admit this pie was a bit bland.  I really had to pile on the red pepper.

- Bianca pizza: The cheesiness is heavenly.  The zing and flavor of all the different cheeses is melodious.  And greasy as all get out, but worth it.

- I don't drink beer, but a pint of PBR was $3.  I think that's pretty cheap, right?  My glass of a delicious New Zealand Sauv Blanc was only $7.  Yeah, SEVEN.

All in all, for four people, we ordered the eggplant app, and 2 large pizzas...and still had about 6 slices left over!!  My advice: if you go with 4 people, one large pizza and a salad should do the trick (I saw many a salad pass by; they're pretty big).

Returning for sure.  Do you think they will just give me a bowl of red sauce to slurp up like tomato soup if I asked?",2012-03-09 00:30:38

As for Umi, they get high marks in my opinion for for quality of sushi, quality of toro specifically, taste of rock shrimp entree and sea bass with miso.  Our server Benjamin was friendly, delightful and professional as well.  

It was good and I am glad we went to experience Umi, but life is about managing expectations and despite my 3 stars, I too am not sure if I would go back.

I want to give it 4 stars on food alone, but the negative points which made me more inclined to give it 3 stars were:

1) only being able to get a reservation past 9pm any day of the week for many weeks in advance on Open Table (built up my expectation of what I thought Umi would be)

2) being turned away from Valet at our 9pm arrival because it was full (again, built up my expectation of how in demand Umi is)

3) the long flights of stairs to reach the restaurant is a haul if you don't like or cannot walk stairs with ease.  Although we are fit and able, we were advised that there is not an elevator to get patrons to the restaurant, but a person could be served Umi menu from Soba restaurant on first floor.  Not sure where the ADA compliance is here, but even if they are up to code, seems bizarre in the 21st century to hear from someone that it is almost incredibly inconvenient to show up with an issue that would prohibit you from walking up stairs in order to be served at Umi.  But regardless, ""stairway to almost heaven"" again almost feeds into to expectation of ""what is at the top"" and what my experience will be. 

4)  venue space is indeed small and thus explains limited reservations.  It is a calming, welcoming, dimly lit designed room...felt cool, hip, modern in a way.

5)  sushi quality was indeed there, but sushi portions are indeed small.  The Rainbow Roll is my barometer on sushi and thus my bar on comparing one sushi establishment to another.  Portions do not need to be large to be considered great when it comes to sushi, but for $27 for a Rainbow Roll, the expectation is there that this is going to be so amazing it is going to rock my world.   Quality was very good, roll was very fresh, but not $27 good.  The slices of fish on top of roll were too thin to be warrant the price.  I am happy to pay $27, but the restaurant set my expectation up and I was a little disappointed.  If the Rainbow Roll was $20, I might feel differently.

Food is standard to most In-N-Outs - don't forget the double-double with grilled onions and animal style fries.  That will fill you up for less than $7 and is probably the best deal in Vegas since the $2.99 steak and eggs at the Gold Coast.

Don't try to beat the crowd - from open until close this place is nuts.  They also have a company store next door so it makes it worse.",2011-12-09 16:08:53

Food Quality & Price: Pho is always great at this location, plenty of ingredients and noodles. They are thinner noodles and the broth is refreshing. The Hai Nam chicken is also exceptional. If you do take out, though, just get a size small because large and small is very similar. Prices here have always been fair.

Facility: New decor and renovations look great but the washroom still looks exactly the same.  Kim Po could invest their money to make this part of the restaurant reflect the quality of the rest. Noise level ranges from quiet to average unless it is packed on a weekend evening. 

Service: Fast and efficient.  The servers are not very attentive but they get the job done. Pretty average quality service with not much to comment on.

Overall: Kim Po is a convenient and delicious place to go for a cheap dinner. I think this review was long overdue and it comes from experience over many years and visits. It is a little different in that I am not rating a one time dine-in but to attest that in the hundreds of times I have been here, I have never been disappointed with bad quality or service.",2013-02-04 02:48:31

The first thing you notice about Wong's is how misleading the outside is. It's wedged between a used book store and a bridal store and looks about as big as a taco truck. You get inside, however, and a large, superbly decorated dining room awaits you. I have never, in all the years I've gone to Wong's, waited for a table. Literally, I'm seated half a minute within entering. Even during the lunch rush, there's always room. 

Tea is provided, and between that and the water, you probably won't want to order a coke or anything. The tea takes some getting used to, but soon you won't be able to eat lo mein without it. And expect to get your water glass refilled like at least a dozen times. Literally, I've never actually finished a glass of water before it was refilled. 

The staff is so accommodating and hospitable, it's like eating in a family's dining room table. The service is so on par that out of the years I've been going, only one guy has ever complained about his food. Have you ever seen other patrons at a restaurant tell a complaining customer to STFU? Well, that's how awesome Wong's is. No joke.

The food is, like, whoa. Personally I prefer the lunch specials, where you get the entree, fried rice, egg roll and soup for about the cost of a McMeal Deal. Dinner comes with a big pot of rice that you and your friends will never finish so don't even try.

Foods I Recommend: Pork Lo Mein, Emperor's Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, and Chow Mein.

The menu they offer is also super easy to understand, with clear cut descriptions of all the entrees, which is nice, because nothing irritates me more than a Chinese eatery that serves you soft noodles and calls it ""chow mein"".",2008-06-24 19:15:01

The customer service here is lack luster.

However one plate haunts my pallet; The LOCK NESS roll!   I have been eating sushi for 20 years.  I've had sushi in Japan and i boast of many other alcolades in regard to my sushi history which adds to my rich credibility to this specific epicurean experience which the world has come to appreciate....

This Lock Ness Roll (primarily the side in the red sauce) is a perfect bite and i think will please anyone who prefers subtleties of sashimi, although this is not traditional.  

The rice-free LOCK NESS ROLL, is an experience in texture and flavour.  Although the sauce offers a bold explosion on the taste buds, the sauce subsides almost immediately allowing one to sense the subtle combination of salmon avocados and asparagus, which is revealed to the olfactory in layers in that order.  

This roll is most likely not going to be appreciated by the typical western sushi afficcionado who drowns every bite in soy sauce.  This is a concoction for  those who have a refined pallet.  There is no need to add soy sauce or Ponzu, for the (red, not green) sauce truly makes this roll powerfully bold without overwhelming the subtleties reminiscent of sashimi, but with a more gregarious sabor. 

I consider this a perfect Fusion of East meets west.  Thank you for this creation.  The Lock Ness Roll is a true event in culinary arts, I hope you enjoy it too.",2017-04-24 05:14:52

I was happy to see they were open late in the evening although 8:30 might not be too late for some. But it looked to me like this end of town would close up pretty soon. It's definitely not the strip in Las Vegas. The people were very cheerful and we're processing to-go orders like wildfire. I guess that getting it delivered can be a real Plus for some people. Anyway I ordered up and sat down and had barely been there for just a few minutes and Presto overcame my kung pao chicken and my pot stickers. I said wow is that fast. She said you look hungry I cooked you first. I say thank you and what a wonderful joy that was. Now I have to say the pot stickers were thin skin which I liked, a bit crispy which I like and had a nice feeling which I liked.

cHlxtJsEcj_VWjPySq32xA,xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,MVgTNrbHjQnRNY4QaYIrbQ,4,3,3,5,"Say what you will about WalMart, but the reality is that they are an extremely successful retail entity that is here to stay and caters to all walks of life. My local WalMart is this one, located in the northwest of Las Vegas, about 13 miles from the Strip, across from Costco somewhat near Aliante (formerly a Station casino). 'Decatur and 215' is popular way to put it. 

As many of you know, WalMart is extremely savvy in its competitive pricing. One Walmart will be priced differently than a Walmart located 3 miles away. A LOT of things go into that process including area, local competitors, and demand. Walmart is a retail genius in ensuring that they are truly an unbeatable value in most classifications and my local Walmart is no exception.  

The nation's largest employer in retail staffs this Walmart well and there is always a greeter at the door and a person running self checkout. Some WalMarts in rougher parts of town have the greeter mark receipts much like Costco. However at my Walmart, this is not the case. 

I go to this 24 hour super enter about twice a week on average to pickup basic needs and random stuff. Any canned goods or boxed foods I generally get at the swap meet which is significantly cheaper than even WM (most swap meet food is from Walmart anyway). 

I tend to be a late night WM shopper. I rarely visit before 9pm at night. If you go late enough, there are hardly any customers there and the staff is restocking so be prepared to have to waddle through lots of pallets if new merchandise in the aisles. 

Overall, I am a fan of this Walmart and I am glad to call it my local WM SuperCenter.",2015-08-24 05:36:33

Besides being the closest mainstream mall it was also easier to navigate and enjoy much more than Woodbine or Square One.  

There was a time where the socioeconomic target demographic for Sherway was the same as Cloverdale but each mall while riding the same road with each other for years finally took different paths for different reasons.  Sherway ended up going the route of the more affluent mall with newer and more popular stores and Cloverdale went the route of being the value mall.  

Before this review and my last visit to Sherway (1/20/2016) I honestly cannot remember the last time I actually stepped foot in that mall for any reason.  It may have been years ago when HMV was still in there to buy a CD for my wife... that's a while ago.  I've always hated the parking at this mall because it was always so difficult to find.  For me it was practically a deterrent for even going which is probably one of the reasons I haven't been to Yorkdale in probably over a decade.

While my last visit was during normal business hours during a weekday so I'd expect to be able to find more parking, the north side of the mall has essentially been ""completed"".  This section is the NEW section with all new parking and all new stores and a complete new food court and the relocation of one of the larger stores (Sporting Life).  I went to the new section for the first time which is basically a half loop from the north middle ""square"" of the mall that meets the north west ""point"" of a square figure 8.  That is how I've always explained Sherway Gardens in the past.  It's a single floor, squared figure 8 but now instead of having an ""arm"" that extends to meet Holt Renfrew in one of the last additions, this now half loop is continuous and meets another part of the existing mall and doesn't just end.

Because of this new section and new food court the entire south central portion is being revamped and there's a lot of construction going on for the south side of the mall now.  The former 2 level area where the Sporting Life used to be along with the ""White Tent"" food court is set to be demolished and/or revamped but now that entire side of the mall is void of parking space so yet again this mall is without an entire side of parking.  Supposedly this is where a new Nordstrom will be.  This will essentially add a 2nd American anchor (the other being Saks) to the mall.

I'd have to imagine after the renovations are complete again that parking will be part of the fix as well.  Saks on the east side of the mall is supposed to open in February both for Sherway and the Eaton Centre.  The Saks store lists on their wall that there will be a Pusateri's market in there which will be pretty swank.

Sherway seems to be in a constant state of evolution never standing still for too long.  So many new stores have entered the Sherway fray and it seems more and more are coming especially the popular American stores.  While Sherway isn't quite at the echelon of Yorkdale having many high end designers and other stores that cater to a higher income customer base, Sherway is pretty much in a comfortable 2nd arguably over Square One as far as large GTA shopping malls go.

One of the things that would be nice would be a RAPID transit to Sherway Gardens much like how Yorkdale and Scarborough Town Centre enjoy.  For non-drivers the TTC buses come here but being as popular as Sherway is it's still a bus mall.

The entire area along Queensway near Sherway Gardens is basically big box shopping so if you can't get it in the mall there's other stores nearby too.

While Sherway may not have rapid transit they do have their own highway exit going westbound on the Gardiner split at the 427 north on ramp.  For motorists going east bound towards the city the exit would be The West Mall/Evans avenue and for those going south on the 427 the exit would be the Queensway.  The boundaries of the mall are basically Queensway to the north, Sherway Gardens road to the east/south, Evans avenue to the south and The West Mall to the west.",2016-01-21 18:48:34

The food is delicious and fresh.  I love their fried Peking ribs and salt baked lobster.

The salt baked lobster is cooked in a way that locks in the fresh seafood flavor without any fishiness. The lobster is cooked with hot red and served with fresh green chilies.  The vegetables are fresh, but the vegetables are stir-fried in the same oil that the chiles are cooked in, adding heat the veggies.  While I love spicy food, I don't need my vegetables to be spicy.

The service/waiting time to get your entree  is a little long, but worth the wait once you're there.  It has 3.75-4 stars, instead of five, for less than speedy service/waiting time and the spicy oil that the veggies are stir-fried in.  Happy eating!",2012-01-15 23:44:58

Totally enjoyed it and if I had a choice to see it again I would because this show is just that great!! The costumes and make up artist are very legit and it makes you feel like your really up close and personal with this story.

You will get sucked in for sure, give it a try!",2018-01-12 12:06:22

The hummus was delicious and the spinach pie *(spanakopita) was very good but the side of stewed vegetables were awful and the rice seemed ill matched in our opinion.  We had horrible service sitting outside because we were the only table and would strongly suggest sitting inside where there is really good atmosphere.  The menu had a Greek section, Indian Section and Italian.  We only had Greek food but our server said the Curry is excellent. I would return but only for lunch or takeout and would try the kabobs like my friend recommended and the hummus appetizer. I'm sure they have some other great options but I have a feeling the menu is hit or miss, it's hard to do everything well.

I am immediately greeted by a friendly salesman named Nial. He offers me a test drive and indeed quite a lengthy drive. He is very knowledgable and clearly loves the Audi product. 

After the test drive we sit in the extremely luxurious showroom and negotiations begin. I meet a manager named Matt, who despite being an Arsenal fan, is actually an extremely nice guy and we agree a deal in just a few minutes. 

I am not financing so I hope I can just pay and leave, this is where things slow down. I have to wait while documents are printed which seems to take forever. Eventually they are ready and I then go to Finance manager, again another great guy who is super friendly and professional. His paperwork is immaculate, accurate and after about 100 signatures I am allowed to go to the bank and fetch the check.

I was told by the staff that this is the busiest In-N-Out in the nation.  The staff really didn't need to tell me this.  It's obvious when you come here. The drive thru and lines inside are both always long.  There's people everywhere and I mean everywhere.  Getting a seat inside the restaurant is rare.  You will see a lot people eating outside, on the curb, in their cars, and even at the In-N-Out Company Store. This location is actually not the last In-N-Out before you head to California, but it is the closest to the start of the Las Vegas Strip and airport.  This is the reason why it's so packed.  Plus, a lot of people love In-N-Out. A lot of out-of-towners can't get enough of it. The staff at this In-N-Out is very prepared for the madness.  They're all well-trained and manage to handle the volume of people with efficiency. 

I recently ate here just because it's been a long time.  Last week was actually the first time I ate here as a Yelper.  I went with the usual, which is two Flying Dutchman's with Spread.  My meal was as good as it was the previous week.  I've had their Double Double, 3x3, Animal Fries, and a Grilled Cheese at this location back in the day.  That was a while back, though. 

This In-N-Out used to be the fun one to go to. I say ""used to be"" only because they no longer create the fun burgers.  The first 100 x 100 that I have seen was at this In-N-Out.  The first Monkey Style Burger that I have seen was also at this In-N-Out.  My understanding is that they will not make both these burgers anymore or they were never allowed to.  It doesn't matter if they don't make these burgers anymore.  In-N-Out has a fan for life.  I'll see you soon, In-N-Out.

This fried rice is chock full of meat- a sweeter sausage which was surprisingly yummy, and shrimp. 
Worthy of many a repeat visit! The wait for takeout was pretty long, around 20 minutes. The decor is similar to P.F. Chang's, slightly upscale.

The Silverton recently added WuHu to it's free meal restaurants list for casino promos and at first I was excited! Not so much after finding out it was a 45 minute wait on a weeknight! It's a small place so I doubt this will change. I'm hopeful that since they are new to the promo restaurants list, perhaps some speedier woking and rolling is in their future!

They have a lot of flavors to choose from:
Guava, Passionfruit, Guybano, Cantaloupe
Strawberry Lemonade, Kiwi, Strawberry Milk, Pineapple, Cucumber Lime, and Pomegranate. 

I tried majority of their flavors, but I had to order my all-time favorite - Guava! It tasted so legit & was delicious. They can also add shots to your drink, and the employees cheer each time someone orders a drink w/ a shot.

The set up looks like a pop-up shop, so I wasn't sure if it was a permanent store or not. It's very open, and pretty much in the center of Fashion Show Mall (across Forever 21 on the 1st floor).

Ordering was a little confusing though. They said we could either try samples, order, then pay, OR pay, try samples, then order. Maybe since it was opening day, they were still trying to determine their process for ordering. Hopefully, by now, they've determined an easier flow when ordering.

Big mistake, there was a chip in the window that was brought to my attention, the guy told me that they can fix it while I wait and at no charge, I just need to give him my insurance info. I told him no thank you, he just kept at me, not taking no for an answer. 

Now, I'm paying full price for a wash with some extras, I do not want to be hounded about the glass. I finally told him that the car was not mine, he starts acting like he does not believe me.

The pressure to get the glass repaired was offensive, the result of the car wash was poor, it was a very low quality job.

I have been here twice, once for breakfast with a friend. We both decided to order the ""Bird's Nest"", which a lovely salad with a deep-fried panko crusted egg nestled on top of it, with crispy pieces of duck. It is a bit on the small side, so...

My friend and I also ordered, and split the Corned Beef Hash, which comes with a piece of crusty bread (we got two since we were sharing), and comes with a slightly-spicy Thai-type sauce which we ordered on the side. It was brilliant!

For desserts we split the BROOKIE, a cookie/brownie mash-up with amazing balsamic-toffee filling, yes you read that right. So go order this now. We also split the Black Forest Cake, which was on the small side for $6 bucks, but none the less an amazingly svelte dessert.

I was so tickled at my first time here I decided to stop by on my way to work around 7:15 AM this morning, as they open at 6 AM.

The pizza is really kick ass. This review may be full of bs HA but not about that. Today the sriracha ranch chicken pie. It's a medium thin crust piping hot and made with love they always say. Pepperoni pie is great too it never fails. It's the great crust here that really makes a difference. The best in town. Really down here it's Suds & Jo Jo's pies and everyone else can get the bozak.

I know I sound like an idiot describing that but I can't think of the proper term for them. For dinner time they have the same things but also include fresh baked bread. They have an awesome lunch special for about $21. You can get an appetizer, main dish, and dessert. Their Caesar salad is to die for as is their meatball appetizer. Their Fried Chicken Sandwich comes with a honey mustard and coleslaw and two pieces of the best boneless fried chicken I have had in my life. It is so moist and simply melts in your mouth. For dinner I've had the scallops, which were impeccable. For desert I've had the strawberry sorbet and the brownie, which came out so warm and deliciously gooey. 

Beverage wise I've had their Garden Mule which is a modified version of a Moscow Mule. I've also had a blood orange soda and a fancy tea. Everything was amazing. 

They have complimentary salt water taffy at the hostess stand which is AHMAYZING!!!! They also have a salt scrub in their bathroom for you to test that they sell out friend. The salt scrub is great and leaves your skins so soft and hydrated. 

My only complaint is that they will rent out the restaurant for private parties but won't notify on any of their social media that they're close to the public. I arrived once and they were hosting a private party so I drove all the way there for nothing, which was extremely annoying and inconvenient. Especially when I was so looking forward to stuffing my face with nummy food. The other complaint was that I called ahead to make a lunch reservation and it wasn't put down.

We each ordered a plate of dumplings.  She had a plate of six vegan and I had nine pork.  We split a summer roll as an appetizer.  We enjoyed our drink and the roll.  It went downhill from there.  About 15 minutes or so after we finished our appetizer, our waiter stops by to tell us that they accidently served one of our entrees to another table and if we could choose another appetizer, on them, to nibble while they recooked our meal.  He served us our free App.  After another 15 min or so after we finished, someone shows with our food.  THey served me the six dumpling plate when I ordered nine.

I denied the other three and asked they be removed from the bill so we could get out of there.  A manager never showed his/her face.

1. It is confusing on where to go when you first walk in.  No clear signage to direct you to ""order here"".
2.  There was no one at the register for a good five minutes while I stood there.  That may have also been why I was confused on where to go also. 
3.  When the person did arrive to take my order, she did not give me any type of greeting.  She just looked at me, almost annoyed like.  I was clearly confused and trying to figure out the menu.  I found the menu to be confusing and not easy to figure out since it was my first time inside.
4.  I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich and a small coffee.  After paying, I was given a cup and no instructions on where the coffee is, how I will get my food, or even a ""thank you"".
5.  The coffee station was a mess, trash on the counter, the cream and milk strewn about, the coffee not clearly marked as to what it was.
6.  The coffee was not hot, just warm, and it lacked good flavor.  It tasted watered down to me.
7.  The sandwich arrived and it was a messy looking one.  The two eggs and cheese not evenly distributed, rather it seemed like it was slapped together in a hurry with little care.  The croissant it was on was huge compared to the filling also.  Not a good ratio.  
8.  No one ever stopped by my table to see how my meal was, if i needed anything, or to take away the empty dish.  Although, one lady delivered someone else's food to me by mistake and I had to tell her that it was not mine.

I was hoping this place would be better.  I see it being compared to Panera on other posts.  Sorry, it is no Penera, not even close.  They need to improve in many areas.

After writing the review below Eat24 contacted me by email to address the pricing issue. They had done the menu incorrectly and I was inadvertently overcharged for extra toppings. They sent me. $2 coupon. That really wasn't my issue. I just wanted the pizza I ordered. 

Around lunch time the day after the interaction described below, the same driver arrived unannounced with the pizza I had ordered the day before. He apologized and said he wanted to make it right. He also refunded the $6 I didn't even know I had been overcharged. 

It's not how you fall it's how you get up so I'm adding a couple stars to my previous review because of the impressive effort to correct the situation. 

***********


Ordered pizza online. Half pepperoni and half pepperoni, sausage, pineapple, and artichoke ... Each extra topping cost $2.00 and the bill shows I paid for all the toppings. Pizza arrived without the pineapple and artichoke. 

Driver arrived and I was with a customer. I acknowledged him and let him know I would be with him in a minute. Literally two minutes later he exited the office and started into the employee area ... Not cool. He let me know he was in a hurry. I get that. His total wait was less than 4 minutes ... But at least he got all the money ... I didn't get all the toppings!!",2015-07-31 19:18:13

Not for Cafe Rio! Fresh meat (chicken is my preference), fresh corn tortilla chips, hand fulls of cheese, fresh guacamole, beans, and salsa equals a quick tap dance of happiness from me!

I sank my teeth into and wrapped my lips around some mighty tasty tortilla chips this afternoon on my lunch break. I must say my tin of nachos were by far the highlight of my day here at the sweat-shop.

The chicken tacos at Cafe Rio are equally delicious, especially since they are created within fresh (made before your eyes) tortillas. 

My only *ugh* moment at this joint is when I get the lady that speaks faster than the speed of light and screws up my order by putting pico de gallo (chunky salsa) on my food instead of the medium, more blended salsa. Sounds minor but you'd be surprised at how a few extra tomatoes and the additional energy removing them from my dish can ruin my food mojo. Slow down lady!

2.Southwestern Chicken Salad- this was good...
3.Beef Nachos- Full size was huge- but man thank goodness this was the BF's dish cause this looked like a heartattack waiting to happen...

As a local, I've been multiple times and still don't think I have seen enough. Each time I go, I learn something new or am reminded of something I forgot. Because it's such a full museum, it's difficult to see it all in one go (unless you have 3+ hours to spend!). 

The exhibits are done well and are engaging in different ways. The walk through is pretty easy to follow and shows a great transition from Las Vegas' history, to the history of the mob, to the growth of Las Vegas (and the mob's involvement in that) to organized crime that exists today - and THAT is just scratching the surface. There are so many missing pieces in between that we sometimes forget or aren't even aware of and the museum shows you that.

Tours are nice and very educational, but I think it's fun to walk it yourself, so you can manage how much time you want to spend on something. I would say this is fun for all ages, but due to graphic content in some areas, I am always surprised when I see young children there.

Pretty much everyone except for me and Husband went to the U of I. The out-of-towners in for Halloween insisted there was only one true C-U place for lunch: Papa Del's! They lauded the deep-dish-by-the-slice. I was warned it would be crowded, but I'm willing to walk into the fires of Mt. Doom for some good pizza.

My experience: Meh.

So, I think that people really love Papa Del's because that's where they went in college. It brings back fond memories of late nights or drinking or whatever. I get that. I am very nostalgic for certain college hangouts of my own. However. Papa Del's pizza SUCKED.

I might be a bit unfair in my review. It might be amazing if you get a fresh pie made. It could be incredible. But the slices we got at 1:30 pm (after 20 minutes wait)? SUCKED.They were hardly warm, yet still had dark-brown spots from spending too long waiting to be served. Husband had a sandwich, which he said was decent, but everyone had talked up this pizza. Said it was better than Vinny's, better than Rosati's, etc. WHAT. It wasn't inedible, but I was far from impressed.

Service wasn't outright rude, but also wasn't fantastic. I get it, it's lunch rush on a Saturday. You're used to getting treated poorly by college kids. Still, I expect a certain level of positive attitude from waitstaff. I certainly don't want to be treated like I'm a burden upon you because I chose to eat at your restaurant.

Stopped in this week with several co-workers in search of some good Indian food...and we found it!  We were given a private room, which was awesome.

The food was served in sterno pans on a table, so the presentation wasn't great.  The selection was also minimal.  And I had no idea what they call this stuff.  However, the quality and taste of the food was excellent!

I do remember square chunks of tofu in a delicious orange-colored sauce.  The sauce was spicy and delicious and the tofu was rich and creamy.  This was the best tofu I've ever had.  Really, really tasty!

The spiced vegetables in sauce were also off-the-hook delicious.  I am sooo freaking glad I have found and befriended Indian food.  I can't believe I have been missing these amazing, unique, spicy flavors my whole life.

We went on lunch and the only negative point of the experience was the slow speed of the staff and the payment process.  We each had to go to the bar and pay.  We were not told that the tip was included, the guy just said 'twelve fifty'.  Then I tipped him too.  Then I found out the tip was already included.  Anyway, I didn't mind the double tip, I just didn't like not getting a receipt and having to walk to the dark bar to pay.

Good luck finding this place.  The only reason I found it is because I was with people who had been there before.  It's located in an unmarked tall building.",2011-12-11 12:55:52

We dined here during Las Vegas Restaurant Week 2014 and this tapas restaurant was easily one of my favorites from the many we tried. 

The ambiance sets the initial mood of a big-ticket appetite. You almost feel as if you are entering a secret Alice in Wonderland world and about to head down the rabit hole to experience an interesting turn of exhilarating dining events. Dramatic trees, colorful floor tile art, bold color scheme; Aria Las Vegas, you have effortlessly outdone yourself again.  

LOBSTER GAZPACHO
chilled Spanish tomato soup | lobster meat | cherries. This is out of control delicious. The lobster, very plump and sweet, plus the refreshing zesty chilled tomato gazpacho had a surge of exciting flavor; the slightly tart and sweet cherries just awakens all of your senses.

SALMON
Scottish salmon | creamy whipped potato | horseradish cream. The dish was plated with intense artistry. The pop of color from the edible flowers was the ultimate eating with our eyes moment. But wait until you taste it; the flavor is unbelievable! Each component alone plays a sophisticated and important role in the dish.  Enjoy them all together as the perfect bite. Incredible! The crispy skin itself just kills me. Did I scrape the plate clean? You bet I did.

FLAN DE TURRON
almond creme custard | whipped cream | turron. Entering food ecstasy in 3...2...1. Just one of those desserts where you just want to close your eyes, savor the creaminess and enjoy the moment, like in the commercials.

This restaurant stole the show that day and I kept talking about how delicious they were long after; a truly memorable experience.",2015-01-23 00:15:08

That other place Togoshi that closed down was not even remotely worth mentioning. I apologize but you people are really reaching. I'm not going to name drop, but there are GREAT ramen-ya in California and New York as well as some not so good ones in the mix. 

Monta....I was willing to over look a few things. Like the fact that it's 103 degrees outside at night and you have no working A/C. Also the faint smell of sewage doesn't really get your appetite going as you walk through the door. Let's serve a steaming hot bowl of ramen in the middle of the Las Vegas summer with no adequate ventilation except for some ceiling fans. 

Let's pretend I'm part Asian even part Japanese and I know something about food. Yes the food is decent and the ramen, pork belly and boiled egg, noodles are decent. Not the greatest but good enough that I would have returned. Prices are reasonable until you start getting extras. Our bill was $44.00 for the 2 of us. Pretty respectable check average for a small establishment. 

This is where I am not understanding how you could overlook simple customer service. I have reasonable expectations of decent food and decent service.... 

Whoever the arrogant F**K is that owns Monta: 

1. This is not Japan 

2. We live in the year 2010. 

3. There are not enough Japanese here in Las Vegas a town dominated by the Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and every other nationality that you can afford to lose business. 

4. Treat your customers better. 

5. You might as well save some money and switch to walk-up counter service because that's about how useful your waitress was. 

It was not so much a lack of experience or lack of training issue, but more an arrogant I don't care it's not my job mentality and attitude. What? You don't think I saw this in Japanese restaurants 20 years ago? Even the Chinese have changed Mr. Bakatari and deliver with much more friendly and caring service. Is it that hard?? 

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with tamago, extra pork and extra noodles. They serve the extra noodles on the side in a bowl and later I find out why. YES YES YES I know broth is costly, labor intensive and time consuming to make. But if you order XTRA noodles then the ration of broth to noodles should be proportional. It was not even close. I asked the waitress, Miss Personality very politely if I could have a little extra broth as I had a ton of extra noodles and no broth left. I'm not complaining, there wasn't that much broth to start with just enough for the regular order of noodles I was served. Answer was ""no"". No big deal I will pay for extra broth just a tiny bit, whatever you guys want to charge....fat sumo kitchen lackey is like f'****n way and again ""no"" then a half ass sorry as she is walking away. 

Honestly this is such a joke I've been to restaurants in LA and again NY that have the name and ability to be arrogant and pretentious yet the service is warm and hospitable.

Not a bad way to end the season.  For that, the hockey team of players, when their playing deserves 5 Stars.

However, the team ownership can't get their financial act together and as a result has put this team in limbo.  Can fans count on them staying in town?  Who knows?  They get 0 Stars.

The players also deserve 0 Stars for causing the lockout that almost cost an entire season.  Hasn't the NHL learned anything about this kind of stuff?  It almost decimated their league a few years ago.

The folks here were friendly and hospitable (Fraspitable? Hofriendly?) when we came in and offered sample tastes of several dishes.  We tried chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, beef mechado and the special, roasted pork.  As in roasted pig.  A whole pig, roasted on site.  In my head I heard Christopher Walken blurt his patented ""Wow.""

Everything was tasty.  I went with a platter of two meats and garlic rice.  I chose the chicken coconut curry and the pork adobo.  The meats were tender and well sauced.   Savory and aromatic.  Savormatic?  Aromavory?

As we were finishing they brought over a slice of cassava cake, sliced for three.  Very sweet.  (The gesture and the cake.)  When we ordered I had asked if the cassava cake was similar to flan because it looked a bit like flan.  It's not.  It has more depth and texture and substantial vegetable flavor to it.  Good stuff.

I think Karey's gets 4 stars.  This is a place that could take their food to the 5 star level.

FWIW there's a $13 lunch deal . Today it was tomato basil w/italian sausage bisque or salad, then salmon, swordfish or spicy pasta and desert. I think considering the quality it's a bargain. 

We decided to order a la carte instead but I thought I should help get the word out there. This is what we ate instead.

They first bring out a complimentary dip with a basket of Italian country bread. The REAL thing, not the pretty looking but crap tasting imitations that all supermarkets sell, the bread, the bread ...  
5 stars

I didn't care one bit for the dip, although my S.O. liked it just fine. It's some red pesto heavy with sun dried tomatoes, too heavy for my taste I'd rather dip in the traditional olive oil with balsamic and herbs or pepper - No rating

Mussels in white wine ($8) 
A surprisingly large serving for the price and the sauce was excellent, good enough to dunk and even slurp a couple of spoonfuls but richer with butter than it needs to be.  The quality of the mussels themselves was just so-so. Some were gritty, there were shards of broken shells, some had failed to open.
3 1/2 stars

Scallops and artichoke linguini w/pancetta in garlic butter ($16) 
Three huge and sweet scallops, tasty artichoke and al dente linguini, altogether a really nice dish. The thing is I personally tired of  pasta in cream sauces years ago and this sauce left the pasta a bit gooey and tasted more like a light cream sauce than just butter and garlic. 
3 1/2 stars

Zuppa di Mare ($24) not a soup. Catch of the day w/mussels, clams, squid, shrimp and scallops in tomato broth with garlic bread. I just spooned the plate dry of the broth, I'd give 5 stars for the garlic bread and the broth alone it was delicious bar none... but the seafood itself? 

The catch of the day was salmon, which I think not the best choice for this zuppa, and there was tons and tons of it, more than I wanted with one big scallop, two small shrimps and a tiny bit of shellfish. Not what I had in mind, for the record this is a dish I often order when it's in the menu. (5+3) /2 =

2013 was a 3 star festival, but 2014 completely blew it out of the water and was 4.5 stars
The festival was expanded from 2 days to three, the  layout was different and the music was a lot more diverse. 
LIB is a lifestyle festival in the sense that it's not just about the music, but the art, food and people are just as important. Everywhere you went there was some sort of reminder to smile and the beauty of life. I've been to lots of festivals in my life and this had some of the best energy in the sense that there weren't any obnoxious or frat bros types that always appear at fests in varying amounts
The music was also miles better than last year. I love the killers and imagine dragons as much as anyone else but the 2013 lineup was mostly a college rock vibe. This year the extra day helped minimize the conflicts that define most major festivals. The lineup was strong from top to bottom, and anywhere I can go from the roots, then foo fighters, then skrillex is my type of party
--also, dancetronauts were one of my favorite art cars at burning man, so seeing them get their own stage to just go wild was one of my highlights and I seriously seriously hope it's there next year
The biggest and most impactful change was the layout. For example last year all of Fremont east was inside the festival so if I wanted to go to Le Thai or commonwealth is still have to deal with festival crowds and couldn't enjoy downtown if I wasn't part of it. This year the outside businesses were on their own and they added to the experience. Every night when LIB was done me and my friends would just keep the party going by bar hopping
It also helped that container park was open this year because it made it easier to showcase the chefs. Last year it was a clusterf**k trying to see the chefs and enjoy everything else. 
Also, I absolutely loved in and out privileges. There are several reasons why you might need to step out of the fest but the ability to do so is so valued!!

-the negatives weren't much, but I'd say the biggest one was the learning sessions. I loved them, but I only was able to make it into one because the learning village area was small. I'd love for them to find some way to expand it. I hated having to miss out because it was always at capacity. 
Me and none of my group were thrilled about paying for the Ferris wheel. Most fests don't charge and it made us want to ride less. 
This isn't one that I out on the organizers, but if you were drinking your way thru the fest like me you would notice that some bartenders had heavier hands than others 

Overall, this was a 4.5 star festival. And I'm even more excited for 2015 based on the giant leap it took from last year to this

We walk in & get the feeling that people probably end up here when the wait time at The Cheesecake Factory is 30 mins. or so.

Server was not very friendly, never refilled our drinks & seemed to lack training. Checked on our food, looked unhappy & said ""alright"" (no ""enjoy your meal"" or anything along those lines) when we didn't need anything. Not sure they require servers to have a ""pleasing personality"" here.. When we were done, somebody literally just saw us out -- no 4 word, 4 syllable ""Thank you, good night"", or anything like that. As if we went in there & spat on their pizza?

The one nice person in there was this guy that took us to our table & gave my 19+ mo. old son a piece of dough to play with. The 2nd star in this review is for him.

The pizza is only something to write home about if you're writing your family to tell them not to bother with Grimaldi's.

I went here with a group of friends for dinner who also enjoyed their meals. I ordered the Tuna Tar Tar ($15.00) and the Five-Spiced Roast Duck ($20.00). The tar tar is a must and is amazingly presented (along with all of the other dishes). The duck wasn't the best duck I had but it did have a lot of flavor. I know that some people didn't like the duck here so maybe it is one of the hit-or-miss dishes depending on the day but I hope they became consistent with their cooking.

Ever since seeing the menu, I've been looking for an opportunity to give The Workingman's Friend a try and finally made it this past weekend to meet a friend up from Florida.

It's a nice, cozy space with dark wood and a fireplace at the end of the restaurant which was quite welcome on a 27 degree day.  We went on a Sunday and they had both the regular daily menu and a small selection of brunch items.  There is also a local/seasonal craft beer menu to go along with a relatively extensive overall list.

The service was mostly very good.  In terms of quickly checking with us to get drink and then food orders and overall ""paying attention to"" it was just fine.  The downside was how long it took for the food to come out so, more a kitchen issue than anything else.  It was almost 30 minutes between order and food and we watched others around us experiencing the same issue.  End of the day, I'm there to catch up with a friend  so no biggie on that front but 30 min. is pretty long wait.

The food itself was great flavor-wise.  I had the Working Man burger with bacon added.  It came with chips (fries) that were small wedges of potato in a paper bag with both ketchup and a tasty malt vinegar aioli.  They were hot and crispy and the aioli was a yummy dip.  I asked for the burger to be medium and it came out beyond well done and as a result, was very dry.  Again, nice flavor but nowhere close to the temp ordered.  I had a Sunday dinner pork roast to get home to baste and since it initially took so long to get the food, I just let it slide vs. sending back.

I'll definitely be going again since my wife was jealous that I was getting there before she did since she found the place.  Look forward to trying some different food and more good beers.

Now with the negatives: the food. I have eaten Indian food all over the country (San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Baltimore, New York, Washington, the list goes on). I LOVE Indian food. If I had to choose a dying meal, it would be paneer masala with naan and basmati. 
This restaurant served literally the least authentic Indian food I have ever eaten. They tried, but it is painfully Americanized, and I should have known based on the ""whitebread"" patrons here. They even serve hamburgers??? 
They did not serve basmati, instead it was just long grain white or brown rice, and very little seasoning. Their naan tasted like cheap, reheated, store bought pita bread, their sauces/curries were bland and lacking dimension, and the rest of their fare was the most average food I have ever had.

Like others say about it, I crave it hours after I am done eating.  I always get the same thing because I love it.  The sliced beef soup.  I am not sure why.  I am not one to eat the same things all the time, however... this is my favorite meal of the past 6 months.  My wife loves the chicken stir fry.  Yesterday we tried the dumplings and they were splendid as well. 

This place also always has a crowd.  It's not like Jong Wah where you're lucky to find one person dining in.  The family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating.  They remember me and my son when we go in there.  Some conversation is struck up with the owner, he is a very nice man.  My son loves watching them make the noodles, they always smile and wave to him.  He also LOVES the smoothies.

SLICED BEEF TIP OF THE DAY
Word of advice with the slice beef soup for take out... take all the noodles and put them in a bowl.  Spoon out all the veggies and beef (I also add a marinated egg every time) now you have a cup of broth.  Add one packet of soy sauce, a tsp of sirachi and half a ramekin of the homemade chili oil they give you.  Stir it up and pour over the noodles.

The service at this location, however, was awful. When we walked in the manager attempted to seat us even though there was a perfectly capable hostess standing right there. He took us into the dining area, asked us to wait in an awkward location and then disappeared. He never wrote our name or party number down at the hostess station or even bothered to tell her that we would need seated. We waited there for about 20 minutes, and a few other parties who seemed to have just walked in were seated ahead of us. At one point the manager even walked up to us again and asked if we needed a table. I honestly believe that in his mind this was the first time he had ever interacted with us.

After grabbing the hostess and explaining the situation, we were seated pretty quickly. Sadly that was not the end of our troubles. Our waiter was very obnoxious and more interested in hearing himself talk than actually listening to anyone. I got the impression that he was trying to imitate a tough-guy New York deli owner you might see on TV. A number of people asked for their coleslaw on the side because, frankly, it's gross. Each time he challenged the person, claiming that they must not have eaten here before and that we didn't know what we were doing and that ""that's just how we do it here in Pittsburgh"" (Just for the record we were all born and raised in Pittsburgh and have eaten at Primanti Brothers countless times). I think he thought he was being charming like those beloved caricatures he was clearly imitating from TV, but it was really just annoying.

I like Primantis a lot, and it was nice to visit the original location, but I think that status of ""first"" may have gone to their head.

In addition there is a parking lot that you have to pay for. W/ validation you can get up to 2 hours free parking.
The gym is very clean. The bathroom & locker room area is a crap shoot. Because this isn't the typical 24 hour fitness you won't find the TRX setup or battle ropes. They do have all the traditional equipment that other 24 hour fitness locations have. Sadly though there is not a stand alone seated bench. All other benches are there though.

We started with the duck confit appetizer. This was very tasty but a bit overpriced for what you get. We enjoyed it but again, not worth the price.
Our entrees were both outstanding.  My husband had the short rib agnolotti. DELICIOUS. Tastiest pasta dish we've had in a long time. Filled with delicious, tender short rib and served with a horseradish creme.  I had the scallops and they were also amazing. 4 scallops for 35 bucks which is a bit steep but they were fantastic. Charred perfectly on the edge and so rich and yummy.  They gave us a dessert for our anniversary and we picked the bread pudding.  Very tasty. 
We also enjoyed a pretty decent bottle of Bordeaux. We will likely return.",2018-06-01 04:59:13

The wedge salad smothered with maytag bleu cheese dressing was a hit.  The prime rib was on point and my filet mignon was melt in your mouth amazing.. Their hollandaise was out of this world.  The side of creamed spinach was perfect as well.  We left very satisfied.

I was completely curious so I had to check it out. With all the hot pot places around the area now I was looking for something different. 

I like the individuality of the meal, you can pick between two soup bases. One is not spicy and looks milky while the other is spicy and spicy is not an understatement. I love spice but ieven had to take out  a heaping amount of the chili peppers and various spices put into the broth. They even warn you that you shouldn't drink the soup, which was a bit of a bummer for me BC I like to enjoy my soup broth at the end. I just took out about a cup full of the peppers and spices and I was able to drink some of the broth.  The servings of meat is small in my opinion. The seafood presentation is beautiful however. They do have many choices of meats, vegetables, noodles, etc. And what you don't order you can take off the conveyor belt. Unfortunately not everyone in the restaurant can enjoy this conveyor belt feature, so if you are going strictly to experience that make a reservation or don't go during peak times. 

This place can become quite pricey for what it is. Especially since there is another hot pot place down the road which offers more food for less the price and is jist as good. I will say the experience here is unique so check it out at least once.",2016-12-07 04:22:40

I got the croissant with smoked salmon and cucumbers with a salad as a side. The salad was really light and refreshing. The croissant was buttery and flakey.

Done!! Our ""new"" car was outside waiting for us, washed and shiny. All in only 2 hours!!

Shannon was with us the whole way through. She was so friendly and personable. She explained everything so thoroughly and was very patient with my BF and all his questions. It was nice of her to sit with us with during the signing to answer any last minute questions we had. (Which was a good thing because the guy who made us sign stuff was socially awkward and quiet.)

They have like a billion staff working at once but they're all kind of specialized to different areas of expertise and 99.9% of the time I ask somebody for help they send me to someone else.

Sometimes you have to wait a while to actually get helped which I get because it's ALWAYS busy! But at times I feel that they lack communication in letting you know what their deal is. For example, the other day I went in and told a girl I was interested in a new eye pencil and had been suggested the one by Too Faced. She walked me to it and then started walking away! I was so confused by this because I totally wanted to try it and ask more questions and even compare it to other products! She walked me to the mirror and helped me sanitize it and left BEFORE I put it on! Well I ended up loving it and buying it but no thanks to her! Maybe her job was greeter or something, I don't know but TELL ME! Offer me someone else, anything!! Really really really awkward. Sometimes if I need to replenish one of my products I'll go to shoppers beauty boutique if they carry the brand- much quieter!

There was a very helpful girl working though, I was picking up a concealer I had ran out of but wasn't sure exactly which colour it was. She was very helpful and looked me up in the system and was able to tell me the colour by looking at my last purchase of the product. Bless! No more phone calls home to mom and dad directing them to where the product is in my bathroom to get the colour!

If I could make one suggestion to Sephora it would be to do name tags for their employees which specify what they do...it would save a lot of confusion!!

I highly recommend the various yakatori items.  The first night I went I mainly had those.  Nicely done.  Be sure to try the pork belly and the mackerel.  I really wanted some Hamachi Kama but they were out.  The chicken harts were good, but not the best I every had but way above average.  A nice selection of sake was a welcome sign as well.

Just make sure to bring your parking ticket into the restaurant so you can have them make a punch mark.

In the future, I'd like to try out their ""Luckitini's"" which are cutely priced at $7.77.

A lot of it is typical pub fare like fish and chips, chicken caesar wraps, burgers, nachos, etc.  I sampled their sweet potato fries and had some of the beer battered fish and chips.  The sweet potato fries were cooked just like I love - not crisp but lightly coated with butter and salt.  The beer battered fish was quite tastey and came with a side of tarter.

This year, I was here for a Summerlicious dinner. When I walked into the restaurant, I was stunned by the elegance of the interior. The restaurant was truly a beautiful space. I loved the skylight that poured into the room.

Now onto the food!

Vichyssoisse with lobster and truffle essence- for me, the soup was overly sweet and I needed more salt to balance out that sweetness. I couldn't really detect that truffle essence. 

Creole spiced gulf shrimp on corn grit cakes with cayenne bell pepper sauce- the dish was very beautifully presented and I loved the vibrant colours. It was also very tasty- the shrimp was nicely cooked and had that perfect springy bite to it. I also enjoyed the touch of heat in the cayenne bell pepper sauce. I've never had corn grit cake before, so I was surprised that it had a fluffy, egg-like texture, almost like a quiche. It was a great vehicle for soaking up the delicious sauce.

Dungeness crab cake with adobe cream and jicama salad- the crab cake was full of crab meat, which was great. However, I'm more partial to pairing crab cakes with something creamy, usually some sort of mayo-based dip or aioli. While the sauce here was tasty, it lacked that creaminess that I desired. As well, the jicama salad was warmed by crab cake, which made it less refreshing. I would've enjoyed it more if it stayed cold. 

Rose water scented chilled cherry soup with dark chocolate mousse, crisped rice croquant and vanilla tuille- the mousse was delicious: intensely chocolatey and smooth, and the rice croquants were crispy delights! 

Blueberry tartlet with white chocolate cr√®me diplomat, toasted meringue and lime gel√©e- the toasted meringue was like a melted marshmallow, adding a creamier dimension to the tart. However, I found the lime gel√©e to be shockingly sour to my palate. On the whole, the tart was very refined but I actually prefer my pastries to be more rustic, perhaps a little more buttery and greasy.

I think the most enjoyable aspect of my meal was the lovely dining ambiance. As I said, the restaurant is stunningly beautiful! However, there were other glitches that marred the meal. For instance, the food all came really fast one after the other, but our server was not very attentive. We had to ask for water refills multiple times. Worst of all, during the dessert course, there were these little bugs flying around that were very bothersome, and our server never noticed. All in all, I would be willing to pay $25 for the food that I had, but I felt that the remaining $20 went to the d√©cor. Ultimately, I'm not sure that I would come back to Sassafraz. Even though the restaurant is beautiful, the service wasn't perfect, and I'm reluctant to pay a premium just for prettiness.",2011-09-02 21:36:06

First off, this is a pretty decent sized Target. It has a Starbucks, Target cafe, and Pizza Hut Express cafe all located inside. The clothing section is HUGE with tons of brands and merchandise to choose from. However, the downside is that there is less space allocated for the food and grocery area. There is no fresh produce here, which for me personally is a turn off. When I'm out shopping I'm definitely looking for convenience and trying to minimalize how many places I need to go. When I go to this Target, I find myself having to still stop at Giant Eagle or ALDI to grab my fresh fruits and veggies and a few other food items. The store does have a lot of great finds, and customer service is pretty good. Today, we received excellent customer service from Richmond in the checkout line. My only complaint other than the small grocery selection is that the merchandise could definitely be a bit more organized and the bathroom could really use more frequent maintenance. It tends to smell like rotten food, (especially today!) and there is a problem with gnats. If the cleanliness of the restrooms and overall organization of the store improved, this would be pretty much the ideal Target experience!

Overall, I would recommend this Target if you're looking for any typical home, personal care, or clothing items. Definitely not the place to do your grocery shopping, but you can absolutely find a few great snacks and food items here!",2018-09-08 21:06:38

gXwUxnAB1hWQvB8IssiPTg,YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,YauUnQUa9txiPPCQn4RvzA,3,7,1,3,"Rating this place is tough. It was still in preview mode when we went, so I'm exercising forgiveness. It definitely has some serious 5-star potential, though.

First off, it is definitely an experience, not a museum or exhibit. At the start, you basically walk through being a low-level mob person. I don't want to give away too much, but it is kinda neat and fun. You basically interact with a bunch of staff that play different characters.

At several points throughout the journey, you are guided / given overviews and intros by a video image of James Caan, which was pretty neat.

Part of the experience is more museum-ish with several galleries profiling the mob in Vegas, different individual mobsters, and Hollywood and the mob. It was all eh. The best part was the lengthy video about the making of The Godfather.

Likes:
-The ""experience"" aspect (though, it does need some work)
-The emphasis throughout on Vegas and the mob
-That the info was all on video screens, not small plaques
-The overall set-up and props

Dislikes:
-Some of the actors were pretty bad
-The pictures they take of you, in typical Vegas fashion, are $20
-No locals discount
-It seems a little overpriced ($30 during preview, $40 once it officially opens)
-A lot of the video screens weren't working
-The timing of everything was off
-It overall seemed unfinished

Again, definitely has 5 star potential and there are still a lot of kinks they need to work out. It was fun and neat in some ways, but I definitely enjoyed it more than my husband (he says 1 star). I love the concept of this place. Hopefully, it will improve and get better.",2011-03-28 16:12:16

When you go in, grab a menu, pick your dish, go to the cash register to place your order, take a table topper number, sit and they will bring your food right out to you. Clean up after yourself, and enjoy the satiety of your meal. Don't wanna sit down? Get it to go, or place an order online for pick up, or get it delivered on Yelp ($2.99 delivery fee). So easy! 

Gimme all the Kabobs at Zoe's! They are so good. I love the Basil Pesto hummus too. My new favorite: The Mediterranean Salad Trio Bowl. I usually get it with chicken. Peep the Macros: 47g protein, 7g sugar, 7g carbs, 38g fat (0g Trans fat), pretty sweet eh? Zoe's has all of their nutritional information on their website. Next I want to try the Cauliflower Rice Bowl, and the Power Grain Bowl.

My only gripe: The condiment station had really sad and crusty looking Tobasco bottles. I love my Tobasco, and was disappointed that each one had like 5 drops of hot sauce left in them. Pretty please, can you guys hook it up on the Tobasco?

Overall, Zoe's is great spot to grab lunch on the go. Service is always quick and friendly. I work down the street and I'm glad I have Zoe's as an option when I'm deciding on what to eat for lunch. They do catering too,  which I've had at work functions and it has always turned out great. Family meals are also an option if you don't have time to cook, but want something tasty and wholesome.

I'd been wanting to check it out for some time and took the opportunity last week.
Was surprised to find it fairly empty on a Sunday Funday afternoon. There were maybe 8 guests...it was a bit odd.
My girl and I took some time to explore, and finally made our way to the trailer to order some food.
Staff was very friendly. We had a tuna melt and a Chicago dog. Though the tuna was good, it was not what I expected in that it was in a hoagie roll and so was not a melt in the traditional sense. The bread was dry and crunchy. It'd have been nice to have this information beforehand. So, good but disappointing. The dog was good. We also had corn which was good.

Additionally we grabbed Bloody Mary's at a bar stand. Very full of stuff but the mix was especially bitter, or vinegary. I am not a fan. Another quirky disappointment that might best to be explained to newbies, which I proclaimed.

Also, valet parking for an empty parking lot? No thanks.

I headed to the restaurant to try their summer menu and left feeling full and satisfied, with happy taste buds.

My pal and I noshed on tempura fried green beans to start ($6.95) which came with a sambal chili lime dipping sauce I absolutely loved. I gobbled up every last green bean, which was thickly battered but not overly greasy. I appreciated that the appetizer did have a healthy component to it in the green beans, and they were absolutely addictive - I could have kept eating them!

I got the fresh heirloom tomato caprese salad ($9.95) for my meal, which came with a side of spring greens topped with a white balsamic vinaigrette. The tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil were covered in sea salt and a maple balsamic glaze, and I loved this caprese for the thickness of the tomatoes. Everything tasted so fresh, and the glaze to veggie/cheese ratio was appropriate.

My friend got the smoked chicken and pesto pizza ($14.95), a huge portion that is perfect for two people, especially if you're getting an appetizer first. She loved the addition of Kalamata olives on the pie, which also included spinach basil pesto, house smoked chicken, chili flakes, roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, a four-cheese blend and arugula. She liked the thick crust on the edge, which made it easy to hold, while the thin crust throughout the rest let the toppings shine.

Other entrees on the summer menu include grilled romaine and steak salad ($14.95), mesquite smoked St. Louis ribs ($20.95), seared Atlantic sea scallops ($19.95) and grilled wild Northwest salmon ($24.95). The seasonal cocktails looked mighty tasty and include fresh fruit sangria made with brandy and triple sec, and a raspberry mint mule-jito, made with fresh raspberries muddled with mint, lemon and lime, Bacardi Rum, Malibu rum, simple syrup and Reed's Ginger Beer. I didn't try a cocktail on my lunch break this time, but the drink looked beautiful and seems to be strong, judging by the ingredients.

For dessert, satiate your fresh fruit fix with a strawberry rhubarb and white chocolate cheesecake slice ($6.95), made with fresh whipped cream, strawberry rhubarb puree and fresh sliced strawberries in a chocolate-hazelnut crust. Our meals left us stuffed, so save room for this decadent dessert if you're into those flavors.

Service overall is good. 

Food depends on what you get. 

I enjoy their hot pot although slightly pricier than I would like, however their flavours are good and deep so you can really taste what was described. Portion is good for hungry 1 or even 2 and good for sharing in general. Their popcorn chicken is good as well: crispy and not too salty with juicy chicken (both times I had it). Their rice dishes are hit and miss. Sometimes they have great tastes but other times there's way too much rice. A little inconsistent. Also a bit overpriced as well. I did enjoy their mapo tofu with mixed meat rice dish though.

Lastly dessert was sub par at most. Their drinks weren't really worth their price and the flavours were lacking. Tapioca were on the softer side. Their Taiwanese desserts where you get beans and taro balls and grass jelly etc. I would not recommend. Everything tasted like it was from a can and just not fresh. Never had anything else though because it's super expensive but I heard from friends that they weren't impressed.

Service: friendly staff that thoroughly and patiently explains the different offerings.   They handmake their tapioca on Friday and Saturday evenings.   They gave us a sample of their popular No. 9 Royal Tea.   

Decor: interested decor with the deer head motive.   It reminds me of the TV show Hannibal.   Well, minus all the blood. 

Teas: prices are on par with other bbt joints.   Approximately $4.6-5.5 for a regular bbt depending on what you choose.   My husband got the Royal No. 9 and I tried out the Alley trio.   I really enjoyed my husband's drink.   It had a hint of blueberry.   I usually get less sugar with no ice in my drink to a) to avoid diabetes and b) I like more bubble tea.   For the first time, I found my drink kind of bland without full sugar.   So now I'm curious to see how full sugar bbt will be like.   I noticed they used powder milk for their milk bbt.   Not a fan of that.   So I asked one of the baristas; she explained that there is a fresh milk tea but the tea will have a more diluted tea flavour.   

Next time, I will try to have their handmade tapioca and try another flavour with full sugar #screwdiabetes.

The drivers are friendly and will often be closer than cab companies to your location. Unlike cab drivers, who try to get you out ASAP to collect on another ride (because cab companies collect such a large portion of each fare), I feel like Uber drivers are committed to a safe and pleasant experience. I have not felt as though I was going to die like I have in some big city cabs. 

Honestly, I would never use Uber if it is surging and a long ride or a short ride with surge pricing over 1.1 x normal rate. For those who don't fully understand the surge, 1.1 is a 10% increase, 1.2 is 20%, 2.0 is 100%/double cost and so forth. Just pay attention to the surge cost before requesting the ride. I don't see surging as an Uber negative because you do have a choice as a consumer. Also, the surges don't seem to last very long. This is simple supply and demand, so you can't really fault the company and I do feel that they clearly state the surge before you request a ride. 

I feel safe in Uber cars, as they background check each driver and provide insurance for the rides. I enjoy the simplicity of the app and having my card on file so I don't need to carry an abundance of cash. I do try and bring a bit of cash to tip the great drivers, though (although many will try to refuse a tip). Looking forward to when the Uber food delivery service makes its way to Phoenix area!

When I walked in I was promptly greeted by a sweet enthusiastic (but not overbearing) young lady. She asked if it was my first time in and proceeded to thoroughly and succinctly explain the concept. Afterwards, I asked a few questions.  Her responses showed that she was very knowledgeable and guided me in making my choices. I decided to try their Vegan/ GF Yosef and Chocolate Chip, Sugar and the Ron Swanson. 

The last two were both complimentary: She offered me sugar cookie when one of the cookies broke coming out of the oven which I thought was a great way to atone for a mistake! I opted for the Ron Swanson when I saw I got a free cookie with Yelp! checkin. (Wooohoo!!)

You have the option to wait and get all of your cookies fresh baked or select from the ready to go selection. In true foodie fashion I waited. After 15 minutes, I was graced with piping hot cookies. 

I sampled each of them (except the sugar which my sister single-handedly devoured so I'm assuming it was delicious ). They were all very good. The Yosef was my favorite and seemed to hold up best of the gluten free options. The gluten free chocolate chip was my least favorite. It needed a bit more vanilla needed and the dough was a bit gritty in texture. (A for effort). The Ron Swanson had me humming the Parks and Recreation theme song all the way home.  It was the perfect balance of salty and sweet and the dough was pillowy soft. I also had a sample of the molasses cookie when I was waiting which is the perfect marriage between ginger, molasses and warm spices. Definitely recommend all of them.

The place has a Hamptons vibe and the restaurant has a great patio for people watching.

We weren't that hungry and decided to order 2 clam chowders and split a burger. Our clam chowders at $4 was a smoking deal and was a nice hearty portion. This chowder was so good, full of clams and goodies that not only did we eat our portion but we ordered two to go. The chowder also came with two nicely sized crackers to break or dip into the chowder.

The only time I've had chowder this good is when I go to Boston or Connecticut for business.

Yeah it was that good.

When our burger came up, we were honestly already full so splitting it was a good idea. The burger was cooked medium well (although we asked for medium) and had a nicely grilled BBQ flavor. The burger also came with fries. The fries were also of a hearty portion and very tasty. They had a great texture on the outside and were soft on the inside.

Curry chicken with flat bread $13.50 - It came in a large pot and with tons of chicken meat. Mostly dark meat too which is what I prefer. The curry sauce has a hint of sweet and not overly spicy. The sauce was very liquidy and was almost like a soup. It tasted great and I could have drank it like a soup it was so good. What I did instead was order a bowl of rice for $1.50 and utilized a lot of the curry sauce there. The flat bread was light and flaky and went well with the curry sauce.

Vermicelli with grilled pork and spring roll $8.99 - Very large portions. The spring roll was average. The grilled pork had a nice sweet BBQ flavouring. It also came with pickled carrots, cucumbers and radish which was a nice touch since other places mostly use bean sprouts as the side veggie.

I had tried binsu in Seoul around 6 times at different places. And I'm happy to say that Soul Cafe is the closest you will get to an authentic Korean Shaved Ice experience within Toronto, or probably the whole Canada.

In Korea, Sulbing is probably the most well known shaved ice brand. There's also Mealtop, and some lesser cafes. Injeolmi (soy bean powder) is all the rage these days so I recommend that first. Comes with soybean powder, condensed milk, small pieces of rice cake. Coffee is another popular flavor in Korea. Red Bean is the traditional one (patbingsu).

Anyways, compared to Korea I actually don't find Soul Cafe expensive at all. One of the places I tried in Korea was called Artisee. They charge $15 (15000W) for a 2 people portion. Sulbing charges you over $10 for 2 people portion depending on the type. The cheapest I had was at a university fair for $4 for single portion. Surely $6.99 for a single portion is not outrageous to get an authentic taste of Korea. Quite reasonable! 

Most surprising was that they do take out in a styrofoam cup. 

I don't really have any comments on their other menu offerings. There doesn't appear to be anything special. The cafe itself is alright. Not the most upscale cafe out there. And thankfully not as flamboyantly girlish as Cafe Princess near Finch.",2016-10-04 15:00:30

Besides that though, you need to know that Chef Brian Howard makes all of his charcuterie in house! No visit is complete without trying some fromage and charcuterie. 

We've been in many times for dinner but they also offer special menus for different holidays. I have spent Thanksgiving there twice and Easter brunch once.

Reading an overdue issue of Toronto Life with BBQ as their front page for the last week, I've been dreaming about swine all day & night. So, with all the recommendations from the magazine...yeah, see I don't know how I ended up here.

For anyone familiar with the area it is known that parking here is quite a bitch. Thirty minutes before the street parking becomes free, so the three dollars coughed up in front of the parking enforcement was simply bitter. Not the swine I was looking forward to. Upon entering the first of two set of doors, we were greeted by a sign to the side advertising free validated underground parking for all patrons. SON OF A.....

Cute Maitre'D, sat us immediately by the bar upon determining our age. This I didn't like, so when our waitress came for our orders, we ordered her to sit us in the restaurant area. I didn't end up liking the area either, it felt far too alike to the retirement home I volunteer at. 
There was however this almost posh looking elevated section with better lighting, but it seemed to be occupied by a large family gathering. I can't imagine a restaurant that is ""kids friendly"" as the survey question here asks, but considering I saw a number of customers under the age of 4..I suppose this place would be just that.
Mondays are ribs & chicken for twenty bucks, but I just ordered just the ribs. Chris got the Monday special, I had a feeling he'll be paying for it. 
My appetizer was the deep fried calamari, which turned out to be the least greasy calamari I have ever had in Toronto. The sauce was exquisite. The shrimp cocktail was really just five prawns on shaved ice. Large, but dull.
Ribs were mediocre, and instead of gravy for my mash, they only had peppercorn sauce. When I asked our waitress what peppercorn sauce was, she replied ""It's like a gravy"". Very informative.  
The chicken breast that came with Chris' special was a piece of brick that could have been used as a sponge to wash your dishes. Yet, he finish the while thing. I think his feeling pressured since every time we go out to eat I make him look like a little girl with my superhuman portions.

I saw four service persons here, and they were all wearing different outfits..which all looked like uniforms. So when the blonde in the white shirt came to top up my water, I asked her what the deal was. She told me the girl wearing black was the hostess, the waitresses are in the collared shirt, and she wore whatever she liked because she was the manager. I managed to keep my eyes off of her perfect tits throughout the whole conversation. 
This was my first time at Baton Rouge, and really it's just a Moxie's with less moxie. I'm really not impressed with this restaurant, and it just felt like I spent $106 to dine at a cafeteria.

So last week Monday we went over for a late breakfast, but it was still busy enough that we had to wait, although it was less than the 30min we were told. The restaurant is VERY small, definitely TOO small to function properly. We waited inside, but there would surely be people outside if it was a weekend, and the staff had to keep walking around and between people to get to the tables. All of this also meant that it was somewhat louder than most breakfast places I have been. Inside is nice and bright as the front and side of the restaurant are all windows, and there are a lot of pictures and ornaments throughout the front area where we sat. The service was not bad considering how busy it was, except that it took a while to get our lattes, which apparently are always made by the owner's son (so I have been told).

As for the food, it was all very good. I had the Basturma Scramble, which is saut√©ed beef and spices mixed into scrambled eggs with pita bread and salad. It was all piping hot when it arrived, and very tasty. My friend had the Cairo Classic, which is one of the various versions of foole (fava beans cooked in oil and spices) that they serve; it came with slices of boiled egg and falafel, as well as pita bread and salad. We both had a Honey Cardamom Latte to drink, which although delayed was well worth the wait. It was probably the best designed drink I have ever had, excellent tasting as well, and not too strong.

The total bill was almost $40 for two, but definitely worth it for the unique breakfast. Overall, a strong recommendation if you are prepared to wait in line.

Or any harder. Sadly I can not get behind this place with the enthusiasm so many others have. 

Ordering is easy, you just have to decide how many fingers you want in your meal. Few side offerings make for easy choosing. That's a plus in my book. 

As for the fingers, what this place is built upon....yes, they are quite large. Plump, juicy, fingers with a nice breading. To look at them you'd think you're about to bite into something full of flavor & spice. Unfortunately this is not the case. I found them to be quite bland. 

Now the sauce. I am not a sauce person. I firmly believe the meat, whether it chicken, beef, or fish, should be seasoned properly so it stands on its own. Yeah, sauces can be fun, I get it, but they should not be relied upon as an afterthought to season your meal. And thats what this place does. Bland fingers relying upon a sauce to give it the flavor it deserves. Not ok in my book. 

BUT...this might be your thing. If you like bland chicken & dipping sauces this is definitely your place.  It's not mine. I'll stick with Carl's Jr where the fingers can stand on their (figuratively speaking) without a sauce.",2015-03-08 17:30:41

I tried the cheddar popcorn, white cheddar popcorn, salt and vinegar, chili con queso, chocolate tide, and a few other savory flavors I can't remember. My two favorites were the most basic the cheddar and white cheddar popcorn. Neither were over seasoned like all the other savory flavors I had tried.

Here in Scottsdale, we have many alternatives to Panda Express.  

You have The Red Door, Ling and Louie, PF Chang's, Jade Palace, Pei Wei (similar in many ways to Panda Express), George & Sons, to name just a few; or even Flo's which is across the street from this location.  So, the choices are pretty much endless.

The key, I believe in seeking out Panda Express is convenience and time.  Sit down restaurants involve time.  Both in travel, but also ordering and waiting for the food to be prepared and served. Yes, I know most of these restaurants have takeout.  What Chinese restaurant doesn't have takeout?  But here, you come in, point at a few items behind the glass, pay and you're on your way. -- and their prices are very reasonable.

If you have a limited lunch hour, or in reality a half hour, then Panda Express becomes a very reasonable alternative for those of us who eat at our desks.  

In the end, the food is universally good -- not NYC Chinatown Five stars good, but fast food Chinese Three Stars, ""A-Okay"" good.

The fact it was steps away from my wedding venue was just a huge bonus.  And since staying at the Delta two weeks ago, even though I am a Toronto resident (and don't live THAT far from downtown), I keep trying to find excuses to stay at here again.

First of all, this hotel is gorgeous.  The design is spot-on, with many unique pieces of art displayed flawlessly throughout to create an elegant but modern atmosphere.  I stayed in a corner room with a king bed and a lake view, and I could have happily spent the entire stay in the bathroom.  Beyond boasting one of the most incredible views of the lake and our iconic tower, the floor to ceiling windows offered so much natural light during the day.  Plus, the giant soaker tub was incredible.  Not a bath person?  No worries, because this room has a giant walk-in shower.

The rest of the room was quite sizeable, especially for downtown Toronto, with comfortable king bed, a seating area, and a desk with every type of TV input imaginable built right in.  The closet came equipped with plenty of hangers, a robe, an iron, and (a must-have for me at hotels) a safe.  At one point, I had my maid of honour, my bridesmaid, my mother, my makeup artist, my hairdresser, my photographer and a good friend all hanging out in the room with me, and it still didn't feel too crowded or uncomfortable.

Noise-wise, the rooms weren't the most soundproof I've ever been in.  I stayed on a Friday and Saturday night, with Friday being quite loud as excited guests returned to their rooms after a stimulating evening of living it up in this beautiful city.

The staff are all incredibly friendly and bend over backwards to make your stay as good as it can possible be.  From the employees at the cab station, to the check-in staff, to the security detail, everyone went above and beyond to make our stay very pleasant.  Even when we showed up and asked to take some wedding shots at the hotel, they were incredibly accommodating, assigning us our very own employee to let us into some normally off-limit areas to get some incredible and otherwise unavailable shots.

This place has a huge gym (I always check-in to hotels with the best of intentions of going to the gym and never do), and a decent-sized pool with an accompanying hot tub and coed sauna.

This Delta has endeared me to the Delta brand (I've been checking out their hotels first when I have to make bookings in other cities), and even as a Torontonian, I will definitely manufacture a reason to visit this particular Delta again.",2015-11-23 20:10:17

We ordered 8 dishes and 2 desserts.

Must try:

-L'√©clade (4.5/5): The aroma and the broth is amazing

-Pan-Roasted Elk (4.5/5): So many different flavours all coming together

-Pigeon Pie (4.5/5):  I think the pie itself is forgottable(too many ingredients inside the pie) but the highlight was the Roast Squab Breast on the side.  The meat is so tender!!  I think they should just do the roast squab breast with other ingredients added as a separate dish.

-Syllabub Cake (4.5/5) (Dessert): All kinds of texture and flavour in your mouth



Very good but not amazing:

-Venison Liver & Foie Gras Parfait (4/5): nice creamy fresh foie gras so soft.

-Kedgeree (4/5): Nice texture of rice crackers with the smoked white.

-Grilled Mushroom Salad (4/5): Again, all kinds of flavour and texture.  Some amazing combinations

-Bird's Nest Pudding (4/5) (Dessert): Nice combination of ingredients




Average or slightly above average:

-Grilled Whelk (3.5/5): It's nothing special if you have had whelk before.  But it was presented very nicely

-Baked Eel Lake Oysters with Shrimp Hollandaise (3/5): Nothing special about this one

Perhaps it's the same as I once remembered, only now my hypothetical pizza-palette has matured since experiencing other great pie's since I first met Pizzazz? Then again, perhaps my criticisms are perfectly warranted....

The decor is quite different from the original Pizzazz on SOM Center. I'll even go as far as saying I prefer the Mayfield location to this one. Gasp! This Pizzazz boasts a large, brightly lit dining room. The building is newer and lacks some of the character of the original location. It's loud and often crowded. I think better light control would help tame the crowd, but I digress.  

Patrons include a good mix of college students from nearby John Carrol to families with kids. Lot's of boisterous kids. Forget about a relaxing meal at this place because it can get quite loud. The Mayfield location is a bit more conducive to a relaxed dining experience than this location. 

One thing that bothers me are the pictures on the website. They're a bit misleading and seem to be a stark contrast to the food that is served here. Now, I'm not saying the food is horrendous, but the website boasts some really vivid food imagery that resembles up-scale Italiano food. Pizzazz is clearly not that. 

For an appetizer, we started with a side of fried cheese ravioli's which ended up resembling a pierogi; so much so, I almost asked for a side of sour cream and apple sauce. Fried rav's should be breaded and stuffed with oozy cheese. This one was an oily round mass of un-breaded pasta stuffed with dry cheese. Very unappetizing. 

For our main course, we split a calzone (sicilian) and small pizza (pepperoni & italian sausage). Both were passable, but with reservations. The calzone contained capicola & genoa salami with onions, fresh mushrooms, spinach & provolone cheese. One odd thing that stood out to me was the raw red onions. It left a pungent taste in my mouth for the rest of the evening. I would've preferred them to be saut√©ed prior to them being stuffed in my calzone. 

As for the pizza, it was decent, but nothing better than average. The dough was a bit too doughy. The sauce a bit too bland and the toppings a bit too greasy. For a 9"", four-cut pizza at $9.25, I expected more. 

Perhaps in title, but lacking in definition; I'm still trying to figure out where the dazzling style, flamboyance and flair that inspired the title ""Pizzazz"" came from.",2010-01-29 14:05:48

There's really not a US equivalent to Canadian tire. It's part Kragen Auto Parts, sometimes part Firestone and with lots of hardware, sporting goods, and home and garden thrown in. I rarely go in looking for anything in particular, but usually end up buying something that I probably could have bought at home. Wandering around and window shopping is at least half the fun.

There is lots of room to sit and music is always stellar. The barkeeps are awesome and friendly. Occasionally the service is slow but it's still really clear the staff are working hard and fast - there are just too many patrons.

It can be a little annoying when I get there early, eat a table and within moments I'm surrounded by people as the bar gets busy but this is a function of bars like this. Now that I know what I'm getting myself into, I can adapt accordingly. It can be loud at times (again, starts off kind of quiet early in the evening but gets loud later) but the music is normally so good that I don't mind.",2010-06-09 14:46:47

It was delicious. I went there this time for 'liner' (lunch/dinner) and I decided to get the goat cheese panini, I believe is what it was... I was not really impressed. The Salad was amazing, although the panini not so much. 

On a side note, I say it isn't good for kids because it's a wine bar, not a restaurant really. However, they do have highchairs available for those that need/want them. It's probably more safe that if you're going to have a glass of wine, leave the kids at home. That's my opinion, but I've found it's more enjoyable without the wee ones. (I have one, so don't think I'm antichildren)

Also, I say it's trendy because it is. I guess depends what spot you are heading to. I always feel like I'm not cutsie enough when I go in, but you know what?

I got a chicken burrito with black beans, brown rice, peppers and onions, sour cream, and cheese.

pepper and onions still had a nice crisp with a good sauted flavor, and the sour scream and cheese added a binding creamyness to everything.  Everything came together as a filling and tasty burrito.

I got some guacamole and salsa on the side to keep my burrito from getting soggy. I just ended up eating them separately as dips with some chips. They ended being a unexpected and good side dish.

But the Cons are

Wheres the pork?   I ordered Fettucine with ham, mushrooms and garlic.
 
The ham was shaved and it was a 1 slice shaving if that , (on the slimmest setting)  this was torn and tossed in my pasta, maybe the person preparing it was hungry and did a one toss for you, one for me and then the last toss ended in their favor.

Sometimes they seat you, but you can seat yourself. If you come at night (Thurs, Fri, Sat) you can't talk to your friends because the karaoke is loud. It's fun because they play a lot of stuff you'd recognize from the radio. They play it on a huge screen, very nice. Many children run around casually at all hours. Be ready to be patient ordering if you don't speak Spanish. Staff is kind and patient.

Complementary chips. Often times, if you devour them, they will offer more. Then they bring a slaw and red sauce in a bottle. Save it for your meal and go nuts with the sauce right on top your pupusa.

Clearly quantify your pupusas and each one's contents to the waitress. Two is enough for one person. If you don't know what to get, just get cheese. I also enjoy the corn tamal con crema (enjoy it w/one pupusa) and the chile relleno con queso (comes with salad, rice and beans). Get yourself a negra modelo. It's served in an ice-cold beer mug.

When you finish you may not get your check brought to you. Just go up to the register when you are ready. They figure it out with no explanation.

The only time I didn't enjoy my meal was the most recent time I ordered a chile relleno. It had a hard spot from I can assume was from microwaving it too high. That bummed me out.

If you go here with the expectation that it's not cheap and portions are a bit small then you will be fine, and it's the reason I am giving it 4 Stars because I knew this going in and was ok with it.  

First up - for the portion sizes the food is pricey.  My friend had the scallops with lentils.  It was good but you got 3 scallops in a bowl of lentils.  Now I'm a small person and can't eat a lot at one sitting...but even that was small for me.  I believe it was $28.

I had the burnt end beef brisket with lettuce wrap.  I found the meat to be way too salty for my liking - and I like salt!  My other friend had the steak with polenta I believe and the steak was done well.  I had a nibble of hers and enjoyed it.   If you check in on Yelp you get a free bar snack and our server recommended the deep friend cauliflower in korean bbq sauce.  Ummmm...hello heaven...these bite size morsels of goodness were the highlight of the evening.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of them myself.  Smothered in sauce but with a crispness outside and the softness of the cauliflower inside, these are a big hit.  

Their cocktail drink selection is minimal but really interesting - I had the Louisville to Lisbon and it was delicious.  With hints of lime and a kick of cayenne it was a great juxtaposition of flavours.  It's $14 and while pricey I enjoyed it.

Their beer menu and wine menu is more extensive and they have a lot of beers I had not heard of (not too unusual as I'm not into beer) but the list seemed interesting.

This place is deceptively small looking from the outside - it can hold a big group and would be great for private events as the space it really well laid out.  It looks like it could turn into a club after hours.  The service is really amazing - starting from the hostess who takes your coat to all the servers who kept checking in on us and recommended dishes when we weren't sure.  This is more of a lively and fun atmosphere so if you want a quiet place to talk or an intimate first date restaurant I would avoid this place until at least your 3rd date.   Super high ceilings with dark wood and exposed brick and beautiful lighting gives this places an upscale 50s Mad Men's kinda vibe.

It is an absolutely gorgeous view come sunset and perfect on Thursday nights during the summer when they have free live entertainment. I have been to the USNWC before but never ate at this place. It did not disappoint, we had quick seating and service. They had a nice beer selection---not overbearing like some other places and the prices weren't too high. 

My group had an appetizer of fried pickles with ranch dipping sauce which was great (you really cant go wrong with that) 

I had the Apple Walnut Chicken Salad -Marinated grilled chicken atop spring mix with apples, crumbled bleu cheese and candied walnuts with Balsamic Vinaigrette 

Fantastic salad! It was very refreshing and the candied walnuts added a nice sweet touch to contrast the apples. And I am all for any kind of crumbled cheese! I was looking at the hummus plate but needed something cool and refreshing and this hit the spot! 

I definitely recommend this place, the service was good, food was great and you cannot beat the location. Go on a Thursday or Saturday night during the summer and there is live music and you can hang around after and just chill. So happy Charlotte has this place!",2010-07-18 01:37:01

EuOxQD8H83Bdy-fsZOlbLA,vASaF47nWvCHEEDA8nfCVw,mG71gQ5HWl7ut9OCN6NJKA,4,3,1,2,"having visited (and in some cases, lived) in enough cities with tall towering landmark structure where you can either get ripped off by the admission fee or by overpriced and underwhelming food and drinks, i would've thought the hub's BFFL would have steered away from the restaurant on top of the CN Tower.  Why? Cos (1) these places are by default tourist traps and locals would rather starve then fork out the amount of money they are charging for sub-par food and drinks and (2) these guys' better not be scammin' the hub because they really are BFFL in the traditional sense (L in this case being since grade 3).

But they did suggest the 360 Restaurant, and I didn't wanna be the diva and judge on something i've never had before.  so i kept my expectations low and followed along.  

Sure enough the whole thing at the beginning felt like deja vu: the security check, the lines at the elevators, the cheerful guides in uniform, the mandatory picture-taking in front of the green screen for the usual chroma keying exercise, and of course the too-fast elevator up the tower shaft (the only difference was the entire elevator was freaking out when realizing that the floor that they were standing on was transparent and they could see the ground rushing away from them as the elevator ascended).

Everything was pretty much like any other top-of-the-skyscraper restaurants until I saw the massive wine cellar - apparently the world record holder for the tallest wine cellar in the world, and full of non two-buck-chuck wines.  some of those ports date back to 1970's.  don't ask how much they cost - if you have to ask then you can't afford it.  

Then i started noticing that the menu is a bit more expansive, the service was much better, and neither the bread nor the butter was not stone-cold.  The hub and I shared a 1-lb rack of lamb, a 10-oz NY cut (rare), fries with truffle aioli and sauteed mushrooms.  they were fantastic.  like i-would-come-back-again-and-pay-that-kind-of-money fantastic. 

Once we got the food, the wine and the service right, the rest of the night just went beautifully.  The view was definitely what ppl went there for - 360' view of Toronto.  I couldn't care much for the south view - vast expanse of dark Lake Ontario water (and, as if on cue, the AC in that part of the building is much colder than the rest), but I definitely appreciated the tall, recognizable landmarks of the amazing city to the north of the tower.

Now if only the temperature wasn't 36C (with humidex) in the summer and -15C in winter time, I would probably consider living here.",2011-08-10 05:32:38

My favorite food that we had sampled was the coconut chicken tenders (to die for!). They also had ribs which my husband really liked, cheesecake, and a spinach mushroom bacon pizza (yum!). 

For dinner I had a grilled chicken sandwich which I added swiss cheese and bacon, with the salsa and tortilla chips. My husband had a cheeseburger with fries. The chicken was very good, but I didn't really care for the chips and salsa. I thought the chips were paper thin, and I like my chips to have more substance to them. My huband's fries were very good and so was his cheeseburger. I stole a good bit of his fries. 

For dessert we had the chocolate chip cookies which are served warm. I think you get four or five to an order, most of which we boxed and ate later. They were excellent! 

As for the service during the cocktail hour we had I thought it was very good. The servers are fun and were definitely part of the reason we had so much fun! During the movie however, it was a little strange. We sort of had a specific waiter, but other would stop by if our light was on to see what we needed. I think it threw off the serving process that we all ordered at once. I think during a regular movie, you order when you sit down initially so that would cut down on the confusion. 

Overall, I enjoyed our experience. I think the highlight was definitely the food and drinks. If you haven't had Cupcake wine, try it! It's very good. If you've been to Mez and then go to SMG, the decor hasn't changed but the mood and the experience have really improved. Good job SMG! Keep it going!",2013-03-25 00:20:12

In retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a ""World Famous Gyro"" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.

Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?

The Farmer Burger Combo was delivered to my table. The burger was so loaded in toppings I couldn't taste the 1/2 lb of beef. The fries were overdone. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

The combo also came with a cookie. It has been a while since I spit out a chocolate chip cookie, but this one got me to do that. Neither the texture nor the flavor was in any way good.

Strike two, drink orders were incorrect but I was willing to overlook such a minor mixup considering how ""busy"" they seemed until.... Strike three. My original review from 2010 can be completely disregarded considering the lack of customer service provided by Nate, who did not seem to understand what was communicated to me during my last visit less than two weeks ago, which was that my stamp card could be redeemed for a free meal during my next visit. This is what they have always honored for as long as I've been coming here. I had one stamp left to go until my free space; the server from the previous visit guaranteed that one of the meals would be comped if I came to visit for two. And no, this was not honored to me by one specific server; it is the tradition followed by every server I've ever had in the dozens of visits I've paid to this establishment. But this is the final time I will be dining here. The staff is poorly trained and, instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering to have a manager resolve the issue on his behalf, Nate chose to argue with me for five minutes, which was even more frustrating than his piss poor job at executing my bill. It's a $40 bill, which isn't detrimental to my wallet whatsoever but the audacity of my server talking down to me when he is at fault was appalling. There are plenty of places I can go to in this city for better sushi and this Yelp review will not be the last place I express my disgust for Sushi Kaya. Pass along the message that Kaya does not play fair and that Nate the server is clearly too good to put the customer's needs above his own opinion.",2016-01-09 07:22:34

The decor is great as well as the service.  I love that they have a full sized peter-built truck in dining room. Although I've notice some difference between the dine in pizza kitchen and guys that do carry out, the Guys in the front who make the carry out slices, do a better job then guys in main pizza kitchen.  What's cool is you can have different styles of pizza cooked in different ovens, 900, 750 and 550 degree.  I had a 900 degree pie, which they sell as authentic Italian, that wasn't so good, the server removed it without a hassle. Which was awesome, the fact it's a 900 wood cooked pizza , it should have had some  charring with a varying degree of soupiness in the center.  however the line between charred and burnt is very fine. To me it was burnt, but some of the dough was a little under cooked. This is a tough call here so im not going to knock the rock.

Rules about Walters: Plan at least two weeks ahead for an appointment. It is worth it. 

From there you don't have to worry about anything. On my particular car I always have to fix the suspension, and I ended up needing the same repair from last year. Last year I spent $1,300 from my very reasonable and trustworthy mechanic I had been using for years at home. This year Walters quoted me just under $700. I was pretty blown away by that considering the other place I go to is just as down to earth as Walter's.

Walters took the time to put my tennis racquets in my trunk and remove my aftermarket stereo so they wouldn't be seen. He explained everything to me thoroughly and was really friendly when I came to pick up my car.

Not big enough. 
Music is turned up too loud, thus making it hard to listen to music on your laptop or iPod Touch.

The focus of Winghart's menu is pizza and burgers, so I decided to take advantage of the fresh pizza ingredients and the house grounded meat by ordering a medium rare burger with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and fresh basil. The burger was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. My friend - who never finishes his food - ordered a Market Square burger and finished the whole burger. Being overly picky, I thought the bottom bun was a bit too thick, but, in defense, the burgers are very juicy and need strong, absorbent support.

The ambiance of the bar is warm and compact. There is an open kitchen which you can sit right in front of and watch the chef prepare the food. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly.

(fruit, cheese. nut) salad. After seeing how large it is, we decided to split one! The salad was good, loved the ingredients! They serve the salad with a piece of bread, it was very hard so I am assuming it was suppose to serve as a large crouton...?

I was surprised that any child over 42 inches is charged the adult price but I guess they have to make the money some way.  So the 7 year old with us is paying the adult price which I think is ridiculous.  Ages 10-12+ I understand but 7 year olds should get a reduced price. 

Parking is $5 which is reasonable but good luck finding a spot.  This lot is the smallest I ever seen!  

Lockers are available for daily use and you get a bracelet that opens it so no losing keys which is a plus.  

Water fountains are available so you don't have to purchase bottled water in this crazy heat.

The wait time for a ride was 10-45 minutes on the big rides and 5-15 minutes on all the others.  They have bracelets for front of the line that are an additional $30 but honestly if you are only going to so a few rides it's not worth it.  

The wave pool was really small and the waves were just as small.  The lazy river was my favorite and the highlight of the day.  The park was a lot smaller than I expected and I imagine the weekends are way more overcrowded than on Monday morning when I visited.   I would never attempt a Saturday/Sunday visit here!

There were 16 of us, so I was lucky enough to get to try tons of stuff from the menu, as we ordered many dishes and shared them around.  The dosas were great, I also remember the aloo gobi and palak paneer standing out, the samosas were huge, and the vegetable cutlet was another delicious highlight.  I can't think of one dish that we ordered that was not completely devoured, really.

Though this place is certainly humble, service is fine. The staff were very good sports about accommodating our large group, which was a bit ramshackle and gregarious.  We weren't even sure how many people were coming, and once we had all arrived, they helped us sit in a more comfortable place for a group our size, not seeming at all annoyed at having to deal with a large group.  We did go on a Monday evening, though, that was fairly quiet.

I agree regarding the affordability - our bill averaged out to $14 per person, including the tip, and that's after ordering many appetizers, desserts, etc in addition to the entrees.  I can't wait to go back!  If not for it being a little removed from the city, I think I would eat here all the time.

They have lunch items as well, the breakfast is just so damn good that is all I ever order!

They make a great omelette and a great burger, the sandwiches look scrumptious oh my, I am in a tale spin just sitting and watching these yummy loaded plates pass me by on their way to other customers, the fish and chips look divine, will have to try next time!

The other dishes looked much better.  I also got a side small tuna rice bowl. It was minced tuna but it also felt so minced that it became really dry.

We started with one of the featured cocktails and Maple Bourbon Bacon. The cocktail was much larger than the typical cocktail and was plenty for my husband and I to share since we aren't big drinkers. The Maple Bourbon Bacon was awesome. The bacon was tasty and crispy. We loved the bruleed banana and banana mousse on the side. It was interesting dish that they pulled off well.

My main included Brulee Grapefruit and Crab Cake Benny. The grapefruit was unique and tasty. I liked the sugary layer on the grapefruit which made the fruit taste a bit decadent. The Crab Cake Benny was delicious with a nice amount of crab and nicely prepared poached eggs.

My husband had the Bacon & Egg Ravioli. He thought it was okay, but nothing special. It was also only two pieces of ravioli which wasn't enough food for the cost of the dish. The pancetta was hard to find in the dish since they used so little. I wouldn't recommend this dish.

Being centrally located close to campus I have visited Steepery plenty of times since they first opened about 2 years ago. I like how they use authentic tea (black or green) in their beverages; I can always taste the tea in every sip. They are also very good at customizing every beverage you order (sugar level, ice etc). I have tried black tea, green tea as well as their shakes and fruit smoothies. My favorite by far are still the traditional classics -- taro black tea and matcha green tea. For smoothies, the pina colada offers a refreshing feeling especially for the summer 

The only thing I avoid are, sadly, their bubbles, after several occasions of having  bubbles that were not cooked all the way -- soft on the outside and hard on the inside. This is pretty unfortunate as the chewy bubbles are an integral part of bubble teas. I haven't gone back to try their bubbles again in a while now, so I am not sure if they are more consistent. 

I still visit Steepery often for their teas or smoothies, just that I order my beverages without bubbles. Bonus -- You get a free upgrade to a large drink for every check-ins =)",2014-04-24 22:50:53

This place runs quite a few promotions here and there and also offers a happy hour. The food and the drinks are of but don't expect anything amazing. Appetizers are rather on the cheap side.

In the past, I patronised this business only in the late hours. I exclusively ordered the chicken burrito and rolled tacos. And I was certainly not a fan. 

At this juncture, I have experienced more thoroughly their menu here than at any other Roberto's and I am a fan. 

It could be that their staff was turned over. It could be that I should have always just tried going before midnight or late-night. It could be that the growing competition from other businesses in the neighbourhood caused them to step up their proverbial game. 

It could be any number of those factors or a combination thereof. 

In any case, they have an unannounced Military Discount for those with DOD cards. 

They have excellent chicken, carnitas, and carne asada burritos.

Once in the restaurant, the ordering counter is right inside the door.  The menu is clear...sandwiches, pizza and salads.  Being new here the guy at the counter gave me a few suggestions.  I went with a greek salad with chicken.

Once you get your cup, you proceed to the drink station which is large for any restaurant.  There are 2 soda fountains and then about 6 tea dispensers in various forms.  Sweet, unsweet and and my favorite sweetened with Splenda (that got the 5th star just for that!).

Someone brought out the salad and it came in a funky shaped red bowl and the salad was HUGE!  The salad was fresh and great flavors with romaine, red onions, kalamata olives, grape tomatoes, pepperocinis, and of course chicken.  The dressing was light and the salad wasn't drenched in it.  

The only thing I didn't like about Newks is that I thought the tables were a little close together.  But overall, I think it's fantastic!  There needs to be more Newks around Charlotte!",2011-11-12 23:06:11

The indoor space seemed bigger online than it did in person but nonetheless there was a fair amount of seating inside and outside. It had a nice aesthetic inside, simple, clean, and sleek. Easy on the eyes and inviting! Their menu was simple yet still hard to choose from. I debated between the Hot Mess bowl and the Nom Nom breakfast burrito and the Hot Mess bowl won. The Hot Mess bowl consisted of potatoes, eggs, bell peppers, sour cream, spinach, eggs, tomato, and cholula sauce with a slice of toast. It was flavorful and filling. The potatoes were nicely cooked and seasoned. It was definitely something that I could whip up myself, but for $8 I will gladly pay for convenience sake. I washed my meal down with their Strawberry Jasmine lemonade. Clearly, based on my picture's caption I didn't know what I was drinking LOL but that's beside the point. IT WAS DELISH! It was so refreshing and light. I feel like the Jasmine tea helped calm the tartness of the lemon and the sweetness of the strawberry, making a beautiful menage trois of flavors in your mouth. 

Considering that this wonderful discovery of mine is on the complete opposite side of town from me, I would be more than happy to take the journey back just to have a taste of their other food and drink items. The staff was accommodating and the service was fairly fast. The day I went there was a sign up that food order would take 15 minutes or so to be made but I didn't even notice the time.

First, know that this is not the super greasy, huge, cheesy slices that we also love! The pizza here is more like that on a diet. :D If you aren't into the fresh, light, healthy kinda pizza, then I wouldn't recommend it. I got the Mushroom and arugula pizza which was pretty good! I would say maybe there is too much arugula piled up on top to the point where you feel like you're eating a full on salad. But it's not a big deal to me. Just take some off. 

The salads here are pretty good. I like the chicken, pine nuts, tomato, and gorgonzola. I'm don't usually order salad because they don't feel like a meal to me but that one is really good. 

I like the style of ordering here although I've read that some people don't like it. It's similar to wildflower, where you line up, look at the menu on the walls and order at the counter. Then, they bring your food to your table along with some rolls if you would like. This is a pretty quick and efficient way of getting your food and the servers are really nice!

Maybe when you order, you may want to request them to put those on the side so it doesn't ruin the taste of the soup base.

My impression of this chain was less casual then the d√©cor and ambiance of this location let me to believe. This AF is all about warmth with the pizza oven blazing through, walls of Italian wines and rustic interior. But, this isn't some place to have a pizza and tutto bene. Dinner time, especially on the weekends, can be a zoo. This AF is in the same plaza as Moxie's and Marlowe's and Honest Lawyers so parking can be insane. 

Interestingly enough, I have been to this location more often than not for lunch. It's quiet and just the way I like it. Space is large with tables, booths, high tables...seating preferences for everyone. There is a separate bar/lounge area which quickly becomes a waiting room at night if the place gets busy. Wines are extremely reasonable with the cheapest bottle being $28.


For lunch, they always give you a separate piece of paper listing the specials. I had the Squash soup which was warm and filling (great for a cold day!) For my main, I really felt like something hearty so I opted for the Chicken and Avocado sandwich...chicken, avocado, bacon, cheese wedged between soft Ciabatta bun. Yes please! 

Our waiter was en pointe and even brought us a warm bread basket, which from my mom I heard, isn't something that always happens. Furthermore, when we asked for lime wedges, we expected only one or two, but we practically got two whole limes! Not stingy for sure. My mom, aunt and grandmother all had the Tilapia which was a good size. Two big pieces of fish covered in a cream-like sauce, served with Rapini and noodles. A filling lunch for sure!

In any event, I have been here once for dinner on Friday and it's like being in a zoo. Part of the reason why I'm giving this a 4 star most likely has to do with me being here on lunch time: not many people (when we went it was 3 other tables), attentive service, and great food (probably because the chefs had lots of time to perfect our dish). Would my review be different if I went here on the weekends? Most likely. In any event, loved this location. Great food and service.

Food was pretty good overall.  We got a couple orders of the queso fundido and guacamole.  The first order of queso was really good and horded my certain members of our group.  The second order came out really bad - a half inch layer of grease on the top.  The manager was very kind to return this one and replace it with another order.  The guacamole was also pretty good, but basic.  Entree wise, I think their menu is very limited, and they should really advertise that their tacos are street taco size.  I ordered a chicken taco, fried shrimp taco, and a side of rice and beans.  The flavor of both tacos was pretty good, although there was gristle in my chicken taco, and there was like only 1 shrimp in my shrimp taco.  The rice and beans I would pass up on next time - no flavor at all.  My husband and one of our friends had also gotten chicken tacos - and found bones in their tacos.  

Lastly, because it was for a birthday, the manager did provide banana lumpia for dessert.  This was pretty good - caramel flavor, crisp shell, and a side of ice cream.  This too was horded by certain members of our party.

_P8_CVtGRQLbEiElf4KR8A,6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw,5,1,0,1,"Best buffet in Henderson or Vegas. Only negative is it's quite a long ways away from the strip.

Literally everything at this buffet blows away any other buffet you've been to. Don't argue, just go with it...The pizza is better. The salad is fresher. The chicken is juicier. They have sushi, Chinese, Mexican, American, etc etc etc. You name it, they probably have it. What I appreciate is that on Seafood night they have big, juicy crab legs. A good 5-6 plates of those and I'm good to go. Prices have gone up on the Seafood buffet recently to $39, which is a bit steep IMO, but know that you're getting great quality food for the extra $10-15 you would normally pay. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention to spectacular dessert section of the buffet. Awesome isn't a strong enough word to express my love for it. Everything is made fresh - I even got warm chocolate chip cookies. Ice Cream is delicious. The little candies they offer are really good as well. 

Don't forget the unlimited beer & wine - so if you plan on drinking like a champ, you might as well eat like one too. 

Gamble a little and enjoy the 2 for 1 offers they send.",2012-07-03 18:49:43

Hrrumph. Yes, I am dim-sum-prissy! Royale manages to avoid these pitfalls.  There was no wait at 12:30pm for a table of 5 on a Saturday, with still a few tables left empty.  Noise factor was at a regular level, and you're actually able to hear over the table without having to yell.  Coming here past the early morning special means the prices are considerably steeper (starting at $2.80, going upwards to $6.80 for the more expensive dishes). 

The important stuff: the food. Though I pretty much liked everything, it was the pyramid-shaped, durian puffs filled with warm, creamy durian and encased by a (fried?) flaky pastry dough that were the standout for me. 

The not-so-great: the service, which was nearly nonexistent - save for the ladies who come around with food and check things off the list.  Our tea was never refilled until we waved people down like we were hailing taxis.  Attempts at upsells were major.  Oh, we got something we didn't order?  (The crystal purses filled with shrimp, shaped like stingrays) ""Try it anyway, OK? We already made it, just try it once."" Mind you, he didn't say ""try for free"" - he made us pay for it in the end, even when we insisted we didn't order it and didn't want it.  The same person, also tried to sell a king crab congee special of the day to us, and wouldn't stop trying to push it onto us even when we already said no multiple times. 

Based on the food alone, I'd give Royale 4 stars.  Coupled with the service though in looking at our overall restaurant experience though, it rings in at a 3 stars for me.  And now, back to sleep...zzz....",2015-09-28 15:18:59

The platter also comes with 3 different sauces. One for the pork ribs, one for the beef brisket and one for the fries. The bbq sauce was so good! I wish they packed the sauces with our leftovers. We also got the slaw to go with the platter, which was a great recommendation from the server. You definitely need to get some sort of veggie dish to break down all that meat. If you're a wine lover, the Decoy Cabernet Sauvignon goes really well with it - it's not too heavy and tastes pretty smooth. 

I really liked the atmosphere - perfect for a date or just a catch up with a friend. They have a DJ at around 10 P.M. Not sure if they have a DJ every night, I came on a Saturday.

The service was pretty good. You can get service from any waiter/waitress, they won't pass you along to the original server.

Hissyfits is a fine resale shop for children's clothing.  I've been using resale shops for my children for 16 years, and have seen them come and go.  

The owners of Hissyfits run a good show here. It's a fun, eclectic atmosphere.   Great selection  for infant-to-preteen; they do have larger sizes for young teens, but not as plentiful (maybe because they don't often wear children's clothing).

The pricing is fair, the selection is fresh and fun.  It is tight inside, and can be crowded with merchandise in process but not horribly so.  Plenty of inexpensive gift items here, some cute custom items as well.  Nice selection of toys and furniture flow through.  

If you are looking for a way to get quality children's clothing for less than retail, check this store out.  Need a quick winter jacket or dressy dress?  Look here before hitting a department store.  

As a seller:  My kids are (sadly?) outgrowing children's sizing, but I am still able to bring in my youngest's outgrown or little used items.  They can be somewhat inconsistent with their buying. There have been a  times where I've brought in a really good stack of relevant items, and only a couple are selected.  Once I unintentionally came back  at a different time with the same stack, and another employee took a bunch more items.  That inconsistency aside, I have found them to be professional to work with.

Every once in a while, we order a sandwich from here.  Most recently, we ordered one for our daughter to get delivered to our house.  Apparently, our daughter didn't hear the doorbell ring when the guy arrived at the house (she is hearing impaired).  When my wife didn't immediately pick up the delivery guy's phone call, he moved on to his next delivery--I get this.  However, when my wife called him back a minute later, the guy refused to redeliver the sandwich, saying that he didn't want to waste his time.  Interesting.

Our doorbell is loud and plays for an extended amount of time--I'm surprised that she didn't hear it (she hears it every other time there's a delivery-why not from Silver Mine?)  We were also very surprised at the reaction from the delivery guy.  Again, I completely understand that he's got a lot of deliveries to take all over town, but his attitude really sucked eggs.  You don't refuse service from a paying customer, period.  The guy at the store tried to make excuses for him, but we weren't really having it.  The sandwich did eventually get redelivered, but it took a phone call to the shop to do it.  Not acceptable.

First off, is it me, or should there be a Chipotle in every major mall or shopping center in Las Vegas and Henderson?! It's our favorite organic-based restaurant (a Panera just opened up recently near us and I wanna try that place soon), and hubby would love to eat here once a week, too.

We've eaten here several times. We usually sit at the outside seating in the middle of the mall  aisle (fishbowl effect; just seats and trash cans surrounded by a little fencing), but the last time, it was so deep into the lunch rush, that we were lucky enough to get a table inside (napkins, forks/spoons, Tabasco hot sauce (chipotle version is delish), drink fountain inside, right side, facing the front of the square-shaped restaurant). Long line, but worth the wait, and once you get the food, mmm, it's all about the happy bellies.

Inside it's small (if it was just those tables and chairs, it would be a hole-in-the-wall), but that's why there is seating in the mall, too. Once the line got really long, the staff was churning out the food (and they got it right, too) and managed the line to zero people after the lunch rush. Kudos to them to managing the mischief (they were still nice, too, while being busy, which I can appreciate). Then, they got to do some cleaning and refilling after the crowd died down (after the high-fives and smiles). It is nice to see some fun and genuine customer service (it's a downer when you get service from people who just do not care, and they don't like people, and it shows)---again, not the case here. 

My husband always gets a burrito (carnitas is his fave) while I get a bowl (regular white or brown rice- it depends, chicken, medium salsa, sometimes, I get the corn, black beans, some cheese, some sour cream, some lettuce) to share with our son who loves rice bowls (and rice, in particular). We used to have leftovers, but our son, when he loves something, finishes his food with much enthusiasm (""Mum! Mum!"" he says, which mean 'more food please'). 

My favorite meat here is the barbacoa, but I don't get it often. It is rare to have a bad meal here. Honestly, the only thing that could make any Chipotle any better is if they offered seafood in their meat selections.

GREAT FRESH MEXICAN SEAFOOD!! We got a tip from my husbands coworker to try this place out. We went the same day because we were very excited to try some fresh seafood. It is in a location that could make some get a little uneasy... I will explain.
We walked in & immediately saw that EVERYONE had a large abundance of shrimp on their plates in all different styles. One of the waitresses signaled for us to find a seat. They brought chips & salsa as soon as we sat down. We started off with drinks... my husband had the margarita which was large & tasty, and I had a pina colada which was good. When we looked over the menu we wanted to order everything! They had pictures & it all looked delicious! He ordered a fish plate with rice & salad. It was a large piece of flounder covered with a cream sauce filled with shrimp & octopus... Wow! Very good! I decided on the shrimp salad with avocado. I have this thing with wanting my salads chopped for easier eating & I was happy to see it came chopped!! except the shrimp of course - those were whole, fresh & cooked perfectly. It had what seemed like an endless amount of avocado - impressive! I also got a fish taco a la carte - it was deep fried (all right by me) and then they give you your own squeeze bottles full of sauces to top it off yourself which I thought was ideal. It was all great!
Did I mention our food came out lightening fast? It was only a matter of minutes- less than 5 for sure!

I don't want to sugar coat the atmosphere... there was a guy who came in to get some relief from the hot concrete he apparently called home. There was a nice patron who bought him a beer & maybe some food - didn't stick around long enough to see that- but that patrons brother got up to stop him because he said the restaurant didn't want him there! It caused a minor scene, but the brother did not win... the guy sat drinking his cold beer - that made us feel good to know there were good people willing to step out & do a good deed!! The situation didn't really bother us at all. Then there was a young (young!) boy who came in that was peddling for money & who you could tell was sadly hooked on serious drugs. He did score a small donation before he was asked to leave & did so without incident. My husband wanted to kidnap him & get him some help because he was very young & it was a hard truth to ignore, but we ended up just hoping the best for him. Very sad. Bottom line- those were minor occurrences in a room full of ordinary people.

The salmon cakes were awesome fresh and crispy the pinto beans were to die for along with the greens that were seasoned to perfection. The cheese cake for dessert was awesome sweet and creamy and the best part the prices are reasonable!!!!,2014-03-01 04:43:11

You order your food at the counter and wait for your number to be called. Had to wait about 10 minutes but it was fairly quick. The place is only so big but seating wasn't a problem as people just ate and left shortly afterwards. 

I ordered the chicken kofta kabob dinner (one skewer of chicken, one skewer of kofta which is ground beef). Both were delicious and flavourful. The chicken was extremely juicy and not dry at all. The dinner came with rice, salad, and bread. The rice is out of this world, I could eat it everyday if I wanted to! Amazing. Price wise it may be a bit more expensive but the portions you get are huge.

For a Monday morning, it was pretty crowded when we arrived at 10:30 am. Wait time was about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table. We weren't in a huge rush, so it didn't bother us.

The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. Not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. It totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why I love Vegas! The menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. Feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does shrimp scampi sound good - check; how about ribs - check. If you're craving it, I bet it's on the Peppermill menu.

My husband and I stuck with breakfast since it was mid-morning. I had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. He liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. My scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. I hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that I prefer. It was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. For a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.

We were a tad disappointed in the food, but I guess if you go late at night after a full night of drinking, it probably is decent.",2009-03-25 03:44:18

You screwed up, big time. My daughter was supposed to fly unaccompanied this morning at 7:10 am, but apparently Southwest had a huge computer issue and delayed UM (unaccompanied minor) seats for safety reasons. Ok, sounds reasonable...except for the fact that they never notified us. My husband got there and was told at the desk that she was bumped to the 12:00 flight. So he called me because he had to work, we did some schedule finagling, I drove to the airport with my 5 year old, and we got back into line. Then, we waited for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. Just for a gate pass for me and my son. We were then told that they still hadn't released UMs to fly so we might not get to board. Umm...what??? 11:30 am rolls around (6 hours at the airport) and its boarding time...but not for her! They decided that they were just going to cancel all UM flights for today. Hey, thanks for the advance notice! I got one apology, and that was coupled with  ""It came from corporate"" , like that's supposed to be an explanation of some kind.

So I called my mom (because that's where my kid was going) and she called corporate to rebook the flight. She said she was placed on hold for 10 minutes and the agent came back laughing. She said she was brushed off completely, even after waiting 58 minutes on hold.

I called them and waited on hold as well to find out if there was any other flight tomorrow besides the 530 am flight my mom chose. The dude that answered had no idea there was UM restrictions and put me on hold 3 times. I asked how I am supposed to know if the UM restrictions got lifted tomorrow if the agents don't even know there are any and I got just about no where. I could have driven the distance to my moms in the time is took me to deal with Southwest today. 

I still have hope that Southwest will buck up and fix this MASSIVE mistake. We've had a long, good relationships (with minor ups and downs like most), but I don't know if we will make it through this one. You can really tell how good a company is at its core when something big happens. It's very telling.

The rooms are nice sized and are ok to lay your head down.  The beds and linens aren't very luxurious, but they could do worse.  The bathroom is very large with separate shower and tub and an abundance of marble.  The surfaces, unfortunately, get a bit slippery, so you need to tread with caution.

Noodles:
The noodles are my favourite part of this place. You can hear the constant thumping coming from behind the counter, so if you are familiar with the cuisine, you know what that means. They are hand-pulled, making them fresh and slightly chewy. Perfecto!

I ordered extra meat and noodles but only because I was REALLY hungry. I could barely finish my food. My brothers had normal serving sizes and they too were filled up by the end. We all got the large size and it did well for all of us.

It is a tiny dining room and I went on a Tuesday and it was crowded. You have to call to make reservation and you can't call before five because they won't answer the phone.  However it's a great place to share a meal with your friends as we found out. It has a very extensive wine list so we started with a bottle of white wine. I would generally drink red but the friend I was dining with always drinks white so I'm game. We each picked an appetizer and we shared those.  After that we decided to each pick an entr√©e and share that also. The food is so good you could just keep eating and eating. They didn't seem to mind that we ordered our dinner in stages and they didn't seem to mind that we lingered over our wine even though as the night wore on it got busier and louder. I can't agree that it's better than the Thai place near the green  door (still an absolute favorite of mine) but it is really excellent Thai food and I agree that if you don't like Thai food you should go anyway--it's that good!!!,2014-10-20 20:52:43

We also order tofu nuggets (which I fell in love with right at the first bite), shrimp balls, fish cake, and green tea cheesecake. 

I love their tofu nuggets. They taste marvellous. Shrimp balls, in my opinion, was too floury. I could hardly feel the shrimp inside. Not bad, but not very good. The fish cake was tasty, but didn't leave me much impression.

The cheesecake was okay. I've tried many amazing cheesecake, it definitely wasn't among one of them. It was smooth and cheesy, but I could taste the ""fridge-taste"" on the cheesecake (like..you put your cake in the fridge with other food for too long, the cake started to lose its own taste...)

And for the non seafood eaters, they have chicken and steak. I like that they have tons of fresh veggies you can add and seaweed salad.

I love the option of pumpkin or banana bread with you meal. The breads come out hot, fresh, and begging to be smothered with butter. The portions are HUGE and cooked very well. It's like they've been doing it so long, it's effortless perfection. The potatoes are thinly sliced and grilled to almost a potato chip consistency. The omelets are never over cooked, done just right. I've tried several omelets with egg whites and I enjoyed all of them. My boys like the stuffed french toast or the bacon, egg, and hash.

My boyfriend and I went with a couple friends for dinner on a Thursday night that wasn't particularly busy. We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated right away. The decor is an eclectic mix of shabby chic meets rustic farmhouse (it would be an absolutely fabulous venue for a wedding reception!). 

The food was for sure the star of the show. There were four of us and we wanted to try a variety of things. We started out with the deliciously seasoned hummus with an olive oil drizzle and grilled pita bread. We couldn't keep our hands off of it. Next - calamari that was so incredibly good! Not chewy at all (which is a total deal breaker for me when it comes to calamari) and the aioli dip paired perfectly with it. My boyfriend and I split the Caesar salad and it was excellent. The dressing was fresh and flavorful. 

Entrees. I went with the caramelized sea scallops. They were grilled to perfection and I thoroughly enjoyed them with the exception of the vanilla bean sauce. It made it slightly too sweet for me but the rest of the entree was smashing. I would most definitely get it again, just without the sweet sauce. My boyfriend decided on the charred filet and it was cooked perfectly. He's very particular about the doneness of his steak and the chef did not disappoint. The fingerling potatoes and asparagus were a perfect compliment to the steak and he was most definitely satisfied. 

The service was outstanding. Our server, TJ, took care of us and was extremely knowledgable on the menu and answered all of our questions. He was helpful and accommodating without being overbearing and we enjoyed our conversation with him. We'll for sure request him agin the next time we come in. The manager stopped by our table to ensure that everything was okay and we appreciated the extra attentiveness. 

The menu changes periodically, almost making it feel like a different restaurant every time. Breakfast is supposed to be amazing and I'm looking forward to trying that out as well.

The food is pretty decent, and the shakes are yummy. Their vegan iced mocha is by far one of my favorite mochas ever! Their customer service isn't always on point...sometimes it takes a while for them to notice you standing at the counter. The cafe's setup also needs some work. You are supposed to order at one counter and then walk across to restaurant to another counter to pay. Just a little awkward. Their prices are a little more on the expensive side for a cafe, but that's to be expected at health conscious eateries. Overall, Go Vegan Cafe is a good place to catch a bite if you are in the mood for something healthy.

I was a bit annoyed the the raspberry tea was from the fountain. My husband didn't like it but the wait staff brought him a refill before he even drank two sips. It was if they were scared of not proving so great of service that they didn't care if they wasted food.

Regardless, my salad was great aside from the cubed chicken. It wasn't worth the $3 dollars extra to get that protein.

My husband wasnt a fan of his enchiladas.  It had the appearance it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. But in the past we've had great nacho dishes, specifically the Thai chicken nachos.

Yes we haven't been to he playoffs since 1993 but we will some day soon get there and when we do, you'll see that the fans of the Blue Jays are the most supportive out there. Definitely beats any other teams fanbase. 

But in all honesty, they have the curse of injuries and sinking development. But what makes them the greatest is they are trying. Working up from a great minor league system. Being smart with their trade/draft choices and getting rid of high cost with low quality purchases.

I was there with a friend last night (Tuesday), and we went because of Bingo.  Yes, the temperature yesterday was a record high but the temperature in the restaurant was also a record high!  It was practically sweltering!  We sat in the lounge as that is where Bingo was happening.  The ONE bartender was overwhelmed as he was making drinks for not only the bar crowd but the restaurant patrons as well.  The place was jammed packed as it was not only Bingo, but Taco Tuesday and everyone likes a bargain right?!!  

The staff was incredible though...everyone was pitching in to help where they could and kept a smile on their faces while under great stress and heat.  I was at a community table and my friend and I ordered guacamole, the delicious corn and two chicken tacos plus house margaritas.  Everything tasted delish but the lady next to us said our chicken tacos looked different from hers....ours was shredded chicken and hers were like cubes of chicken.  We asked a busboy and he went and checked and came back and said they had run out of chicken and were having to use a different kind.  I really liked mine but the lady next to me said she didn't like hers.  Anyway, the place continued to bustle and the poor bartender continued to be in the weeds.  I can't say enough good things about how the staff worked together to make an effort to keep things moving but there really should have been two bartendars on duty.  

I love the fact the hotel allows Bingo to be played there and it brought in a good crowd of people who were all ordering food and drinks so its a smart move, but next time please have the place cooled down and make sure there is enough staff.

I've been passing by this Checker's for months waiting for it to be built so I could try it out.  I know we have one out there around Boulder Highway but I never seem to get out to that part of town often.  

Going to these fast food joints for a first time, I generally like to try the basics on the menu.  Chances are if you can handle the basics effectively, the rest of your menu should be OK.  With Checker's I was just passing through, so all I ordered was two All-American Cheeseburgers from their value menu for $1 each.  

It is their grand opening, and this Checker's was pretty packed.  There were folks filling the dining room and the drive thru was full.  There was noise everywhere behind the counter, fries being dropped, orders being mistaken.  Very likely for workers still trying to get the menu items down since it's all new, so I had no issues with errors this time around.  They just need some time to settle in.

My order was quick and easy to make, so I was in and out of Checker's in no time.  Service was friendly and quick, and the counter layout is very similar to those of other fast food joints like McDonald's, Burger King, and Carl's Jr.

What is the most different on Checker's menu and what makes them stand out is their wing menu.  Yep, orders of chicken wings!  I can see why the place is popular and has a bit of a cult status around these parts of town.  You can get a burger, and some wings all at the same place.  No other fast food giant can offer this currently with lots of success.  Not just plain ol' wings either, Checker's 'Crazy Good Wings' have flavor options:

-Buffalo
-Honey BBQ
-Asian Kick (hiya!)
-Angry Buffalo
-Garlic Parmesan

The orders I did see go out of the kitchen looked pretty appetizing.  I may have to try an order the next time I'm around.  Tasty.

Checker's menu is a cross between McDonald's, Burger King, and Sonic's.  You can get your cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, and fish sandwiches.  But you can also get grilled hot dogs, cheese sticks (which Checker's calls 'Monsterella Stix', and chili cheese fries.  Their fries aren't of the regular tater either, looks like they are seasoned somehow but they do look good.  Another plus, Coca-Cola products!  If you can serve me Coke then you have a star in my book.

Back to my plain All-American Cheeseburgers?  Pretty basic, but they were pretty good.  Actually better than a McDonald's cheeseburger in my opinion.  I like the sesame seed bun, burger (which I think is flame broiled), cheese, pickle, mustard, and ketchup.  It was very similar to the Burger King cheeseburger which I like very much.  Only thing I would change would maybe be more pickle, add some mayo.  It looks like I will probably be back to try something else.

I normally get a pedicure only once every few months, so they are really janky looking by the time I get to the nail salon, lol.  Anyway, Pink Nails really knows how to change my toes from janky to swanky!

I decided to try out this new location since it's in my neighborhood.  I can easily say that this is one of the cleanest, nicest decorated, non-chemically smelly nail salon I've ever been to.  What I liked most about the place was the huge windows that you could just stare out at while your nails are getting done.  The lady doing my toes was nice and did a great job.  Toes looked pretty flawless.  The place was pretty crowded when I went on a Sunday afternoon with my cousin, so I guess I would suggest calling in advance to see if they had spot for you available or not.

The price for the pedi was $28 plus tip.  I'm used to paying only $20 for my pedis at other salons, so I thought it was a bit pricey.

That said, two aspects of this place were a little off putting to me.  The prep time, and the portions.  With all the Mexican food spots as well as national goliath Chipotle dotting the valley landscape, you'd better be doing everything right to thrive in this saturated burrito market.  From where I stand, this place will have an uphill battle.

A solid overall Yelp rating was what brought me here on my way home from work on a Thursday afternoon.  Its a cute spot right in the heart of the Melrose neighborhood.  I believe Fry Bread House used to be here once upon a time.  There's seating both inside and out, but only for probably about 25-30 at most. I got here around 4pm and the place was pretty dead so I figured I'd grab a few of their items super quick and be on my way.  Not so much.  

I ordered their Shrimp Burrito (which includes chips and salsa on the side) and a plain quesadilla to go.  Total cost was $14.  I sat up front thinking they'd be able to get my food done super quick (since there was only one other person in the restaurant).  5 minutes.  10 minutes.  Finally, just over 15 minutes later they had my food ready to go.  The woman up front was plenty friendly, though didn't seem apologetic about the wait.  I guess this is the normal prep time?  I can only imagine what the wait would be like when its busy.

Alright the food.  When I opened up the bag of goodies, the portions weren't what I expected.  For comparison, I would say the burrito I got here is probably about 2/3rds the size of what you'd normally get at Chipotle.  The quesadilla and even the bag of chips they included were also smaller than what a Chipotle would offer by comparison.  That said, the shrimp burrito I got was awesome.  The texture of the tortilla was perfect.  It had plenty of shrimp, avocado, cabbage, pico de gallo, and a surprisingly potent hot sauce.  Very satisfying.  The quesadilla as well as the chips and salsa were also quite good too, though I've certainly had better elsewhere.

So I guess in summary, 4 stars for the food itself, but 2 stars for the rest of the experience.  I'd probably come back if asked, but I would never go the take out route here again.  I suppose their sole focus might be just on those who choose to dine in, rather than those who want to grab and go.  They have other offerings including tacos, some baked pastries and even a decent Mexican beer selection that would probably make this a cool place to hang out with friends.  But for the same price, you can probably get better bang for your burrito buck at Chipotle and other valley Mexican establishments.",2015-02-20 00:46:30

B0EyaDUx-LUfey5hfsmrpg,M9TjYmTgHayJ22cNkyvW_g,Q_zpUJa66fEgtAIfe6SJQQ,3,3,2,1,"I visited the Agora Theatre & Ballroom recently for a symphonic metal band concert since the band was not performing any closer to my own city, and definitely thought that it was an a-ok little venue for events such as that. The sound quality in the theatre was consistently good throughout the night and the place definitely had a great high energy vibe that completely enhanced my concert experience. During the night (and since tickets are general admission) I was able to explore the upper seating area during the two opening acts, and then later in the night when the main band began performing I stood with friends in the back of the lower level near the bar (at their insistence). Because of that I think I got a good feel for the theatre even though it was my first and only visit.

In addition to loving the sound quality that the place offered all night long, the actual design of the theatre was also pretty nice. Though I couldn't tell if there were any seats in the lower area or not (I believe not for this type of show), the upper area seats rose and curled around the stage enough that no matter where you were sitting, you had a reasonable view of the stage below. I really love it when performance venues have this design, as it allows for a more intimate feel and makes every seat a reasonable one. In fact if I came back and had a choice between standing closer to stage and sitting, I'd stick to sitting, as even in the very last row I was happy with what I could see. And it sure beat leaning around the people in front of me every time they moved when I went down to stand in the lower bar area.

I also liked the system the staff had in place for before the show: when my friends and I arrived before the doors opened staff members were walking along the enormous lines checking IDs and handing out colored bracelets so that if people wanted to drink once inside, the bartenders didn't need to spend time checking IDs themselves. Definitely something that comes in handy at big concerts like that one!

Still, I can't quite allow myself to give more than a 3-star rating. Though the design of the theatre was nice and the experience was a good one, the state of the theatre itself had a couple big shortcomings. I saw a number of cracks and there were chunks of material missing throughout sections of the walls and ceilings - there were also a few places where I stood or sat that I had to wonder if the ceiling above me would crumble down onto my head. The cost of parking in their lot was admittedly a little steep, though if you go as a group and split it, it becomes more reasonable. And while the staff did a great job prepping for the night in the parking lot, they did not do such a good job with the bathrooms (which I guess is the norm based on reviews). The women's restroom was filthy, and this was before the concert even began. A few toilet leaks had created muddy puddles thanks to the dirt in people's boots, and the smell was honestly so foul that I began coughing in response to it. The men's room was apparently not much better, seeing as the friend I drove out with opted to use a rest stop on the road home instead of the theatre's.
 
Honestly I'd advise that people only go here for shows they can't live without seeing. The place just isn't in a state of being that I can see it being a regular go-to, great concert experience or not. Then again, maybe I'm just a little spoiled since my city's theater's are well maintained or so new that they're in reasonable shape. Either way, I'll definitely be keeping the state of this place in mind if another band I love travels through Cleveland and performs here in the future.",2015-04-19 21:43:38

I had the Lemon aid and Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak and Asadero Cheese Stuffed Tortillas with Roasted Ancho Guajillo Sauce, Avocado Puree and Cilantro Rice.

Two things to note: I eat fast (I have a 2 year old, you learn to eat on the go) and I will be honest I eat a lot. 

The portions are not huge but I was satisfied, not overly full. The flavor was out of this world. Very bold, spicy flavors, the Avocado Puree was an excellent touch.

The patio looked very comfortable and romantic, however it is Phoenix, Arizona and summer, you will not see me anywhere that does not have AC. Thankfully the inside was nicely decorated with AC. 

The service was very attentive, I did not have to ask for any refills of my drink.

We ordered Tsuke-Men ($13.50) and the Tonkotsu Miso Ramen ($12.25). I wanted to try the Tsuke-Men because the soup is separated from the noodles so it doesn't get soft as it sits in the broth. The soup was definitely too salty! Adding water to the soup made it better. The Tonkotsu miso ramen was better! The noodle were delicious but we didn't think the soup and pork slices were anything special though. For the prices of these, we will likely try other ramen shops next time.",2016-12-06 21:09:33

I would gladly wait for one of their declious grilled cheese sandwiches.

My favorite has got to be the Pig Mac:  Mac and Cheese, BBQ, and grilled cheese delivery form = perfection.  Load that in with a cup of truffle chips - you are in instant heaven.

I've been super impressed by the truck.  The striking black and orange color combo on the outside of the truck and their super organized inside.

I liked this place.  I went here with my fiance for Restaurant Week, but we priced out the menu and figured it was a better deal to just order what we wanted.  We ended up order oysters, the Hamachi Crudo, the Chicken Wings, the Heirloom Salad, Slow Cooked Short Rib, and the Jerk Chicken.  

The oysters were good, had a nice fresh flavor and were reasonably priced.  The Hamachi Crudo was excellent.  The Chicken Wing was the entire wing that was smothered in a fish sauce / sesame oil mixture common of Vietnamese / Thai flavors.  It was a strange dish.  I was hoping for a fried chicken wing tossed in a sweet chili sauce, so this was a bit disappointing.  However, the taste was interesting and the chicken was cooked properly.  Finally, the Heirloom salad was very good.  I would order the Crudo and the Heirloom salad again.

As for the entrees, the Slow Cooked Short Rib and the Jerk Chicken were both overcooked and dry.  These both were simply execution errors.  The Short Rib needed more braising liquid as the bottom of the short rib was excellent.  However, the top and middle were dry and unpleasant.  As for the Chicken, it was dry throughout the entire chicken.  The jerk sauce is very similar to the one used by DW Bistro.  Neither dish were memorable and I would not order either one again.  

All in all, I'm a fan of the restaurant.  The flavor profile of the food is interesting and I enjoyed the dishes that were cooked properly.  I would return again to try different dishes on the menu.  It is a good neighborhood restaurant that has excellent service and you can see the inspiration in the menu.  That's worth 4 Stars.  :)",2017-06-30 17:19:49

We had noticed the damage on our way in. He asked that we give Centurion another try.
Since, as I said in my review, there were many intriguing things about the place, we decided to do that.

     The patio had been repaired, and even improved on, with the addition of canvas ""sails"" overhead to block the sun. It was 2PM, there were few customers, and we were able to have a good conversation with Eric. He's a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and is passionate about food. With Centurion, he wants to overturn many of the problems he's noticed in other restaurants. He aims to be high-end, but with reasonable prices and no pretension. His kitchen is right in back of the windows looking out on Roosevelt, so the cooks don't feel shut in. And like many chefs now, he tries to use local and sustainable products, making for a seasonal menu.
He even told me a great way to cook butternut squash - using a cider reduction and vanilla.

     The truly notable changes in our meal were with the stuffed mushrooms and the sauce that came with the mussels. Instead of being ugly lumps, the mushrooms were a work of art. They had been split, stuffed with rice, and wrapped in proscuitto. Looking like exotic oysters, they were so pretty I hated to cut into them. But I was glad I did, because this time they were perfectly cooked and delicious. The mustard sauce on the mussels was well balanced, with the flavors of mustard and white wine playing off each other. We kept soaking it up with the accompanying tasty house-made bread. I have to say I still wasn't crazy about the eggplant panini, but it was more thoroughly cooked than the last time. I guess it's just a matter of taste.

     Because it was Eric who served us, things went well. I'm willing to accept the fact that the staff had been upset about the fire and not functioning as well as they ordinarily would. We'll be going back to try the dinner entrees, so I guess we'll find out.",2010-10-20 18:09:39

The menu is boring.  Nothing about it makes it stand out.  ""What is new and different here?,"" is what I thought to myself.  ""What is the ONE THING that will bring people back again and again?"", I thought to myself.

I was told the chopped salad was amazing, so I ordered it.  In the meantime, I ordered a glass of wine.  I had only been there a few short minutes, when another server came over to ask if I would like to try some other red wines.  Perhaps it was chance, but I noticed, she brought two reds in the same ""family"" of that which I was drinking.  Very observant, I thought to myself.  I wasn't happy with either, really, and I was definitely not happy with the glass I ordered, so the bartender took it off the bill at the time my food arrived.  Terrific!

I made the call for Comme √áa since the Wednesday ""Plats du Jour"" was offal.  I'm a big fan of ""mystery meat"" and combined with Comme √áa's intriguing cocktail menu made it an easy choice for dinner.  We arrived a few minutes early for our 6:30 reservation, but were seated immediately at a table in front of the large floor to ceiling window overlooking the Strip.  It was a great view!  The restaurant was dimly lit, not that it needed to be brightly since it added a little intimacy in the otherwise large dining room. The d√©cor was tasteful with a Vegas-imagined, French brasserie feel.

I ordered a Thyme for Bourbon ($15), a Comme √áa original, made with bourbon, cr√®me de cassis, sugar, fresh lemon and thyme.  It was a nicely composed cocktail that was made special by the pleasant lemon and thyme aromatics.  We started off with Comme √áa's signature appetizer, Roasted Bone Marrow & Oxtail Jam ($18), served with toast and a persillade of parsley, shallot and lemon.  The marrow juices and oil made for a messy dish, but it was flavorful and enjoyable.  For my entr√©e, I had the offal special, which on this day was Braised Veal Liver ($24) with seasonal vegetables and cippolini onions.  I was mildly disappointed that liver was the day's offal since I've never been a fan of liver.  However, Chef Brian Howard's treatment of the liver changed my mind on how delicious this organ could be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=4yAC5T933WF57qi-FhfGdw#4yAC5T933WF57qi-FhfGdw  The sizable hunk of liver looked more like a thick cut of beef.  It was dense, firm, and cut with a knife more like beef, yet it was definitely organ meat once it hit my taste buds.  The iron-y flavor I'd always associated with liver, while present, was much more subtle and refined.  The gf and I split a side of Charred Brussels Sprouts ($11) with maple bacon and banyuls to accompany our meals.  I love Brussels sprouts and this dish did them justice.    

Upon final tally, Comme √áa delivered a solid, enjoyable meal.  Its cocktails were skillfully made and first-rate.  The food was appetizing and well executed.

I've dined there about 5 times now because it's in a great location, has decent food and is a good spot for a group of friends to dine. Unfortunately, their service is not great. From forgetting orders, to wrong orders, to being out of menu items (every time we've been). Last time we stopped in, they had posted their new happy hour times on their Facebook (which I follow). Nowhere on this flyer post was ""Monday - Friday"" so we decided to stop by. Their sign outside also did not note days, only times, so we assumed it included all days. We asked the waiter, he informed us Monday - Friday, then argued with us that the sign listed it. Despite this argument, he was actually the best server I've had there so far. Sad, but true. Also, for the amount of food you get this place is over-priced. Being that it's all heavy food items, you do leave being full. I really do think they could fix a few things and would go from being ""ok"" to ""great"".

We enjoyed their 4-course tasting menu, and on Tuesday, it was only $30.  I'm not sure you could find a much better bargain in Pittsburgh.  It wasn't a pre-fixe menu, it was just whatever came out of the kitchen.  So, on the one hand, I was a bit disappointed to not have tried the touted shrimp and grits or bone marrow.  On the other hand, each diner gets something different, so it was a great way to sample the food.

Oh yeah, the wine comes in a half-glass (4 oz) as well as full pours.  It's just another great way to sample their wine menu.

The food was very, very good.  I wasn't blown away with the flavors, but there was some creativity, which came off well.  One of the last dishes was basically pulled pork terrine.  It was great.  And again, I think there is great value here, for $18 to $22 entrees, vs the $25 to $32 at  others such as Casbah or Spoon.

Lastly, the environment is fantastic.  It's set in a house, so there are multiple small rooms.  It's cozy, romantic, dark, and all with a nice indie music playlist setting the tone.

I'm looking forward to another visit.",2011-12-08 23:55:43

since my last review, how things have truly turned around since then. service has stepped up and i can honestly say I haven't been disappointed. so, let's begin..

beverages are of the essence, so even though I was heartbroken of great white being removed off the menu, the seasonal pumpkin shandy they now have is the BOMB!! it's sweet with hints of cinnamon and is so delicious. safe to say I've drank plenty of these already and you should too if this fits your flavor profile.

food was so much better this time. the gyro was on point. cooked to temperature so it wasn't too dry. my sister got the bread bowl and she enjoyed it. nice new addition on the menu and good choice of mash and stew to put inside. my friend got the steak and eggs plate and it looked great as well. it's promising that breakfast is enjoyable here at any hour.

Second of all it's fresh and made at your table with love - well maybe not but it really tastes that way.

Next we had the garlic shrimp which was mind altering good. I could have drank the delicious sauce it was swimming in...mmm. 

Last we had the wild mushroom flautas which were a bit greasy and disappointing compared to the other two fabulous appetizers. I wouldn't get this next time.

We had two drinks - the Sangria which was pretty delicious. It was fizzy though which I haven't experienced before- but in a good way. The agave margaritas were all natural and quite refreshing as well. 

We then decided to step it up a notch and have a shot of tequila (rough week!) we asked our server for a recommendation - he inquired about a price range and then came up with something that suited both our tastes and wallets. We were told they have a large selection if you're a tequila connoisseur. 

Our server was friendly although at times MIA- we did have to track him down for drink numero dos. He also charged my card three times ($48, $66, $75) and never told me about the two voids. The next day when I went to check my account the charges were pending so they withheld that money. A quick call to the manager and my bank took care of that. I had wished the server told me that up front.

We stopped by this past Saturday night.  For a Saturday, they weren't very busy at all.  Because it was an awesome night, we asked to sit outside.  Most people at the restaurant were outside; there was hardly anyone inside.  That's why it puzzles me that we received awful service and there was no obvious management overseeing the operation.  Our server, Julianna, was extremely inattentive to us and, frankly, couldn't care less that we were there.  I asked her about what a particular beer was like and I could tell she wasn't really listening to me.  She just wrote down that I wanted that beer.  Fine, whatever.  The others ordered water.  She rarely visited our table after that.  When we had been sitting there awhile waiting on our dinner, we had to actually ASK her to refill the water glasses.  One of them was empty, so she took that one to refill, but she didn't even bother with the one that was halfway.  A good server would fill them both.  And I didn't want one, but I was never asked about another beer (or obviously water) either.   The food came out hot and delicious, but it seemed strange there was no offer of Parmesan cheese or red pepper flakes or anything.  There weren't any on any of the tables.  We didn't see her again until we had finished our dinner and asked her for a box for the leftover pizza.  Despite the restaurant being practically dead, it still took her awhile to bring the box, check, etc.  We were just in the restaurant for way too long, especially when our drinks were never refilled.  A manager never came by to see how everything was going.  Nobody seemed to care, and it wasn't even busy (and it was a Saturday night).   Also, during everything, my partner apparently ended up leaving his credit card there (or else it wasn't in the book after she processed the charge).  The next night (Sunday night), we called around 8 PM to see if the card was there because we'd swing by to get it.  The hostess, Victoria, said they were in the ""dinner rush"" and she'd have to take our name and number and have someone call us back.  If their dinner rush was anything like the ""dinner rush"" Saturday night, there was no rush.  And now, here it is Monday as I write this review, and no one ever called us back.

They had bike racks set up outside the front entrance. I felt entrance to the festival was pretty organized. The only issue being on the 2nd day there were some drunk idiots arguing about why the couldn't bring in their previously opened cigarette box. I chalked that mostly up to audience entertainment though. 

I thought the stages were well marked and easy to find. There was a lot of room, and I never felt too crowded.. Even when masses of people were leaving a show. The app was a great addition. I liked that you could easily see a little about the bands. It gave me an idea of who I wanted to check out. I was able to see some really great unknown artists. That's what these festivals are all about for me. 

Food. The first day I had some absolutely delicious lamb tacos ($10) it was from a restaurant in the Tropicana. They were topped with goat cheese. Yummy! The second day I had a not so great shrimp mac and cheese (I think from Burger Bar) I was not impressed. I also had a slice of cheese pizza from Spicy Pie, which was delicious as usual. A friend of mine had the garlic fries... I tried a few and they were pretty good. 

Drink. I really like that they let you bring in unopened bottle water bottles & empty Camelbaks. It wasn't really hot enough to need 2 full liters.. So I just brought in one bottle. It's nice to have the option though. 

Both days I drank a few beers (mostly $8 or $9 Heineken) I agree the alcohol prices were outrageous... I hope they find a way to lower them in the future, but not necessarily at the expense of raising ticket prices. 

Music sounded great at any of the stages that I saw. I loved all the extra touches of art placed all over the place. 

I really enjoyed a culinary demo with the guy from Chopped, Scott Conant (also owns Scarpetta) and ZZ Ward. Both were very funny. I even learned how to make a new pasta dish. Yum! (Tried it for dinner and it turned out great)

Trash: Obviously this was the biggest issue. Not enough trash cans and they seemed to never get emptied. I figure it took Coachella a few years to get the trash issue under control, so I'm willing to let this slide for a bit. I'm sure they can figure something out. 

I definitely thought Imagine Dragons made the show.. By far the best of Saturday, and of course The Killers killed it on Sunday. I hope this is an annual event.

And yes, Home Depot on more occasions than I can shake a severely bandaged hand at has helped me to build even the most odd of things, from an ill fated attempt at a home entertainment stand to three of the heaviest, most over built, shit welded to them Burning Man bikes that the Playa has ever seen.

But here's my gripe about this Home Depot, men can't build shit before we die as mandated by our DNA if there is no where to park!

Went in today to get more painting supplies. Every parking spot in the lot had one of those dolly sized carts in the spaces. No fewer than FIVE employees were standing around the parking lot, bullshitting when they should have been doing their jobs.

I was just looking for four items: an avocado, a good tomato, reams of paper, and mainly printer inks. No problem on the paper or avocado except for circling the fresh vegetable aisles twice before finding where the avocados and tomatoes were shelved. But I preferred vine-ripened tomatoes, whatever the price might be. Finally I found the price on a cardboard sign but no matching vine-ripened tomatoes beneath it or anywhere else. Grudgingly, I finally settled on an ordinary hothouse tomato. 

So, on I trudged to the Electronics Section of the store--only to be frustrated by a collapsed array of sealed boxes of HP printer inks, out of sequential order. What I needed for my very particular printer was 901 ink. And, once I was able to decipher all numbers on the boxes, nothing even close was evident. Then I recalled that the last time I was in search of this same item, the cupboard was also bare but an employee offered to check in the back of the store, and soon returned with his hands full of boxes of the precious 901 ink. 

So, I asked a worker if the store still carried 901 ink, for none was visible in front.. He replied, ""Oh, they're inside now,"" motioning to another interior aisle. Here I was met by another two shelves of disorganized printer inks, with none bearing the numerals ""901"". I was about to point out that no such inks were where the man said they were, and ask him if he could check in the back for them, but when I approached him he was so busy chatting and laughing with a fellow female employee that he didn't even notice me. Rather than butting in on their convivial and animated conversation, I decided that with the very limited time I had available to wait anyway, I would instead just move on to an office supply store, which is just what I did. 

At least the checkout cashier was cheerful and efficient.",2011-07-13 05:30:10

On the negative side, this place gives illusions of healthy eating because of all the words/healthy-ish ingredients all over the menu. But wow the portion size of the foods...like the bowls...even the baby bowls is HUGE and no way it's for one person. Also, if you do look at the calories and the extraordinary amounts of carbs and fats in the food, omg, I almost rather eat a giant steak - for the price/calories/taste. The buddha bowl for example is over 1,100 calories with 45 grams of fat. So that's my beef with Fresh. If I rate it as just a normal vegetarian restaurant, not focused on health and nutrition, its okay but just don't pretend you're eating here for health reasons.

The quinoa onion rings are delicious here - but I mean, I've never disliked onion rings anywhere! The buddha baby bowl was 90% soba noodles with some vegetables on top (not impressed).

THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET THERE!  The Miracle Mile parking lot is crazy busy.  And there are a lot of ""questionable"" people just hanging around in the parking lot.

The food was actually pretty good.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was excellent.  The fries also good.  Kids meals were decent.  We also ordered some kind of avocado burger which was also pretty good.

The prices though were crazy.  I'm not sure if it was because it was located on the strip, or if it was just because it is a Rainforest Cafe.

The chili was pretty delicious as were the homemade chips.  The big problem with my nachos was the fact that there was little cheese to go with the chili and chips.  I had about ten chips left over with a decent amount of chili on the plate and nary a shred of cheese!  I want my nachos to be loaded with cheese!  These ones weren't.  The taco trio wasn't that great either.  The pork and chicken on them was a bit tough.  I think that Nacho Daddy is more of a place for a Happy Hour but in my opinion, it is not a place for dinner.  They have a fair amount of bottled beers as well as the usual drafts and even Delirium Tremens.  They're Happy Hour specials seem good: half off appetizers and something like $1.50 for a Pabst I think.  If it was for Happy Hour this place would get 4 stars but for dinner, just the 3.",2011-06-06 17:33:10

The ambience of the restaurant is nice, dimly lit, and it's an open concept kitchen so you get to see your food cooked in front of you.  For the most part, if they aren't too busy, you are greeted and usually seated right away.  I am usually seated in the booth seats, which are more comfortable and my preferred preference anyway.  I came here for lunch one time with a friend and had one of their sandwiches, which I thought was okay. Nothing special or spectacular about it.  I've also tried their Shrimp Angel Hair (Saut√©ed shrimp, roasted grape tomatoes and garlic, white wine, salsa verde).  I was actually a fan of this dish, surprisingly.  I've also come here another time for drinks and had their Rosso Sangria which is probably one of the best Sangria's I've had.  The first time I got the pitcher of Sangria, we had fresh fruits and ice in our cups.  But the second time we got the pitcher, we had a couple cubes of ice and little to none fresh fruits.  This is a big no-no for me as I like to have consistency.  I was thoroughly disappointed the second time around and did not want to be a prude and as for more ice and some more fresh fruits.  The only reason why I give Alice Fazooli's a 3-star is because the service here is not particularly the greatest and the food and drinks are pretty expensive.  If you're thinking of coming here for a full 3 course meal (drinks, appetizer, main course and dessert), be prepared to pay a good amount from your wallet.  The pitcher of Sangria was $26.. And as good as it tastes, that's all I'm saying. I might come back here from time to time for the drinks and POSSIBLY the food, but that's a big maybe.",2015-02-19 23:32:49

for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing. 

the decor is ""country"" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining. 

i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth. 
my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful.

So I'm on a veggie and protein diet and it was either the salmon dish or the short rib dish. Whatever I decided on the lady was very accommodating as she overheard my diet plan. 

The short rib dish was fiyah!!! It was so tender and flavorful. Literally, meat just falling off the bone. I couldn't eat the root veggies because there's sweet potatoes in it (yea I can't eat that) so I got the saut√©ed Spinach which was pretty good. 

The top of the pepper shaker was loose when my friend tried to add pepper to her pasta dish so they made her a new one, allowing me and my other homie to eat the fish from the dish (no charge) so of course I took a scallop which was big, juicy, and cooked perfectly with a delicious buttery flavor, as well as a shrimp that was the same.

The best part, aside from the romantic lighting and feel, is the happy hour because their amazing drinks are cheap (~$7 for super fancy drinks), they come in really fun glasses - the mojito, which is my favourite, comes in a mason jar mug and has brown rock sugar at the bottom and LOTS of fresh mint, it tastes amazing.. probably my favourite mojito in the city thus far. 

Although I wouldn't come here for dinner, the food is fresh and has lots of fun ingredients, I think the presentation is nice and definitely worth trying something if you're hungry. 

My only major complaint is that the bathrooms didn't smell good and they were so tiny..but I'm not sure if they have nicer bathrooms upstairs.

Only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slightly ripped couches and the tiny bathrooms downstairs..

Seriously though, it is no surprise that Noda Brewing needed to expand just a few years after the opening of their original location. The grand opening of that place seems like it was yesterday.  Located in a neighborhood that in 2010 was reported as the 11th most dangerous in the entire country, the new spot is in a large old warehouse.  The place has much more indoor space with plenty of tables, two bar areas, and coolers stocked with cans.  The outside has a large area that was partially covered with a tent (not sure if this was because of the possibility of rain).  Parking was a little tricky but on a normal night should be okay.  Place is close to the future light rail expansion and existing Amtrak station.  Note that although the address is 2921 N. Tryon it is almost three streets north of 29th St - closer to 32nd.

The place was ridiculously packed and they really did not handle it well.  However, this is one of the better breweries in Charlotte for quality and taste of beer.  They have a pretty good selection including several barrel and cask ales (try the Voyager).  We will return.

We looked on yelp and saw that Black Mountain was open till 12, so we were so excited to have a nice meal. We walked in a little before 9:30pm and right as we walked in a super nice server greeted us and told us to go ahead and grab any booth. So we did, he came over and let us know that they had just switched over to their ""Late Night"" menu which was very disappointing. I was honestly quite shocked that they had switched over so early. When I asked what time they closed since it seemed odd to switch menus so early. He said they didn't really have an official close time, it just depends on how busy they are, if they stay open. So I definitely recommend calling if you're headed there in the evening. 

Since we were all starving and exhausted we decided to go ahead and take a look at that menu. There's probably a total of 12 items on the ""late night"" menu, all fried and bar food. Definitely not what we had in mind. My daughter and I shared the Gravy fries, my other daughter had the potstickers and my husband had the wings. Everything was mediocre. 

I do have to say though the service was great. Our server was extremely kind, friendly and genuine. He checked on us multiple times and told us we should definitely come back to try their full menu.",2016-12-10 09:00:44

Overall, you get much more than you pay for. Yes, it's far from inexpensive however they always hit their mark and offer more than I anticipate. 

Best tip- don't overlook the vegetable streusel.  Fabulous. Also- share your food preferences. Staff makes suggestions and tweaks any menu item to suite your tastes.

IF you really want food delivered to you during a picture, by all means, this is the place to do it. But - if, like husband and I, you just want a quality movie-viewing experience without all the fancy frills and hoopla, there are better and more accommodating options out there.

We were supposed to meet some friends on Christmas day for a viewing of The Desolation of Smaug: a recent - but not opening day new - film. Upon arriving (about 25 minutes before showtime), we were informed that the seats were assigned (uh...what?), and the only ones left together were in the handicapped-accessible area. At a loss and feeling pressured, we bought the seats. Our friends showed up 10 minutes later and were told the show was sold out. 

We would have asked for a refund so that we could find somewhere else to all see the film together, but there is a large sign at the ticket desk that emphatically states no refunds, no way, no how; maybe we could have asked for a manager and pressed our luck, but on Christmas day especially you just don't want to be *those people*. Our friends left for another theater, and husband and I went inside.

1) When we got in, we noticed at least 6+ open seats in pairs around the theater (which was TINY). These seats remained vacant for the entirety of the show. I don't know if SMG was deliberately underselling the show, or if the seats were somehow claimed (maybe by online sales that were no-shows? That somehow seems a bit unlikely, too), but it just seemed fishy to us that there were so many open seats in better locations compared to what was offered to us as ""the only thing left"", and that my friends were flat out told there were no seats left.

2) The seats were comfortable enough, except, with us being in the handicapped-accessible area, husband got stuck with an office chair instead of a regular plush seat. Meh. 

3) Wow, okay. The whole food thing. I get it. I get that some folks want a meal with their movie, I really do. And the servers did generally try to be efficient coming in and out, and to duck under the screen. But, seriously? Major, MAJOR distraction. I want to be focusing on Gandalf battling nasties, not have my attention redirected to the server who's standing in the middle of the theater, confusedly looking around for who ordered the Thai chili nachos. 

4) Again, assigned seating, say whaaaaa? Yeah, I understand that it probably helps with keeping track of the food orders/bills. But it's a pain in the butt if you try to make any kind of plans to meet with other people to see a show together. God help you if you don't show up at the same time! 

To be clear: SMG didn't show us a bad time. I just don't think we were the clintele they aim to cater to, so their best efforts went unnoticed, and their failings stuck out a bit more. We probably won't be back, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go, if you like what they have to offer.",2014-01-07 06:25:54

It was definitely WEIRD for lack of a better word. Okay... let's call it unique, bizarre and one of a kind.  Ladies had open bar from 11-Midnight which we took advantage of, then the ""Acts"" began around midnight. 

The venue was small..... the foyer had a bar and a staircase to go upstairs to the VIP balcony area. The main level was very tight with a bar in the rear a dance floor and a small round stage for dancers in the middle and a main stage in the front. About every 30 min or so there was a performance then everyone jumped back up on the stage to dance until it was time for another one. The crowd had a good vibe and there were GoGo dancers and other characters walking around and interacting. 

I don't want to spoil any surprises for anyone but this club is not for the faint of heart or anyone with 1 ounce of prude in them...  and I must admit I was offended more than once as the performances pushed the envelope as far as they good. I was expecting cute little burlesque shows and honey I didn't get it.  Overall I had a great time. The music was great! The DJ played current hits and the music from the 90s!!! Which I loved... it's hard to find good music in Vegas these days now that house and EDM and random rap I don't know because I'm old rule the scene.  I heard the after-hours after 3am is cool too but I couldn't hang that long.

Never very good at making decisions, I asked for a burrito made of half bean, half TVP. The guy at the counter was super friendly and accommodating, and I was eager to dig in to my halfling creation. 

The first few bites were great -- the texture was meaty and the taste was interesting -- but as I continued eating, I found the burrito to have a pretty flat flavour profile, and I felt a bit ""heavy"" afterwards, even though I couldn't even finish the hefty burrito. I wish there was something like a scoop of guacamole or a bit of cilantro to round out the flavour and add a bit of freshness.

Wonder there was no wait, the place isn't much to brag about. 

Nigiri: 0/5 I hate when I go places and they give me a chunk of rice and a super thin slice of fish. The portions are so off here, the reason why sushi restaurants pack on the rice is to clearly fill you up so you don't get to fully use their all you can eat. Also the fish here isn't very fresh, I might even say dry at times. 

Rolls: 2/5  I usually don't order rolls but my boyfriend does, they have a pretty good amount of variety on their menu but nothing really screams ""OMG I have to try this"" and once again they packed their rolls with a lot of rice. Also I think they make the rice way way before hand so when we ended up getting our sushi roll order the rice was dry and crunchy huge turn off.

Value: 0/5 Honestly for $25 All you can eat you mind as well go some where else. This place isn't worth it. There are so many equal priced or even a bit less all you can eat sushi joints in Vegas you can go to.

Service was great. We got sat right away and decided to sit down at the sushi bar, where we thought we will be ordering directly from our chefs . To our surprise we were not allowed to? What the deuce !!? This was very weird. Are they protecting the chefs and their magnificent sushi ninja secrets? Do I look like a sushi chef killer Come on..I appreciate them serving me fast and refilling my drinks right away but if I sit at the sushi bar and the chef is right next to me, I should be allowed to order from him.

Place is big and clean. Seems to be a good spot for groups too. Nice comfy looking booth and a nice waiting area as well. Lighting is good as well .In general the ambiance is pretty nice. Now..what Im gonna say some of you may not like. But there were no Japanese employees.I understand that most places are Korean owned/managed, but at least lie to me and hire one Japanese person. Its like going to a Peruvian restaurant that is run and managed by Colombians..yes we look alike but we are not the same.

Food is good. The appetizer menu is extensive and their poke salad has big chunks of tuna which is a win in my book.The soft shell crab was delicious. Very well cooked ! Rolls don't fall into the ""damn that's a roll or rice ball"" category so that's another good sign for me as well. I lie the fact that the nigiri doesn't pack that much rice either. Lots of sushi places make this mistake, however Kay packs the nigiri with a good amount of fish.

Will this be my next favorite spot? No, would I come back? yep..if im in the area. There is nothing spectacular in the menu that would make me want to return despite the distance, however it is very good..hard to explain but that is just a personal opinion. The food is good, the price is average and the service Is great. Only thing missing is that IT factor, which makes me decide if I should drive far for a restaurant or not.

The hand pulled noodle of course!

Their style comes from the city of Lanzhou in China. Come expecting customers slurping on noodles from a bowl and ordering small dishes to share. You can also see the noodle in action from an open kitchen they designed with the restaurant. You can also check out the Noodle Robot that they have who slices dough into noodle pieces. Like a ninja! Pretty cool. Of course, you can also see the cooks pulling flour apart, stretching, pounding, and pulling to get the structure of noodles. 

I ordered both the hand pulled noodles and the noodle where it's like pieces of noodle chunks. Both had the al Dante texture and the shapes were irregular so you know it's fresh. I was kind of disappointed in the soup base though. I thought there wasn't much flavor to it and both noodles had the same broth or soup base. The only difference was the other toppings added to the soup. One had bok choi while the other didn't. The dishes are also more on the expensive end. For Chinese food standard, a small dish can easily cost $6-7 dollars and you don't get that much either. Overall I thought it was alright. 

Last tip?

Don't forget to check out the noodle robot in action who can be found close to the kitchen and remember to bring cash because it's cash only here!",2017-08-01 22:58:39

When I found out about this place I was ecstatic because there's no izakaya in Phoenix area. Yes, there are sushi and fast-food type places but nothing like izakaya. So, just for that reason I gave it 5 stars. 

In our party we had 4 adults and a 19 month old baby. We sat at a table around 5:30pm and the service was soooooo slow it took about 4 hours to get all of our food. We left around 9:30pm. For that reason alone I deducted 2 points. 

Cooked food was pretty decent but sushi was not so fresh and tasteless. Sake was overpriced and beer was warm. So, i deducted another point. 

This place is also not kid friendly so minus another point. There was no crayons or anything to keep a child busy and there was no changing station in the bathroom either. Luckily the baby was well behaved and didn't get too agitated but other kids in the restaurant were screaming. 

We had to ask for our order numerous times and average service time took 20-30 min for each order. One of the dish we ordered was so salty we asked them to take it back. 

This places is very small with 3 waitresses and several cooks so you think they have this down but they seemed very confused and customer service was very poor. I understand this is a new establishment but hope they get their act straight so they don't disappoint more customers.

I love discovering new products; even the potential of it! With a list, I'm compelled to go up and down every aisle. This is why I love Trader Joe's so much. First off, the stores are generally smaller than a traditional grocery store, so that whole ""up and down every aisle"" thing doesn't take as much tread off the ole tires. The price is ALWAYS right, at Trader Joe's. It's a great value, especially when you're shopping for one or two people. The quality of their products, most of which have the Trader Joe's label is superb! There have only been a few items that left me disappointed. (Not the best crab cakes, for example) Staples in my kitchen include the dry roasted and salted almonds, the dried mango, the mushroom turnovers, mini chicken tacos, tom yam soup (frozen), yaki onigiri (I can them ""rice triangles""), lemongrass chicken stix (spring rolls), individually wrapped chicken (refrigerator section) and heat & eat falafel.

Personally, no, but that doesn't mean the food isn't by all means good; it just wasn't outstanding like I expected it to be.

The ambience of Le Robin Square definitely was grander than what I pictured yet simplistic at the same time. Its two floor dining area is very cozy with the high ceilings adding an extra touch of unexpected warmth. The place's location in Old Port definitely makes it tourist fodder (proven by the fact that I saw quite a few anglophone tourists there), but at least it's not all hype and no substance.

I ordered the mushroom soup and the mac and cheese with pulled ham. The mushroom soup was divine; it was perfectly creamy yet full-bodied with the meaty texture of - obviously, mushrooms. I finished it eagerly awaiting the main meal. 

While the mac and cheese tasted good, the thing that bothered me the most was that the pasta and cream sauce seemed to be lacking some flavor, even with the addition of some spicy sauce on the side (which, like most ""spicy"" food in Montr√©al, wasn't spicy at all). It tasted more like pasta cooked in a very light cream sauce rather than the cheesy goodness that I'm used to. The bright spot of the dish was the pulled ham, and as someone who doesn't normally like ham at all, it was the perfect combination of light sweetness with a natural smoked and savory flavor of the pork.

Maybe I'll come here another time to try out their pork belly since I'm a huge fan of it when cooked properly. For mac and cheese, however, I might stick to less upscale yet more cheesy versions in the near future (for example, Dinette Triple Crown's).",2017-08-10 10:30:11

The taro appetizer was nice, but I've had better fried taro  at other restaurants.  The dipping sauces were a little lacking in flavor for me.  From what I can remember, the dipping sauces were sweet and I would have preferred a savory/salty dipping sauce.

The curry with dumplings was an interesting concept.  I ended up not really liking the dumplings that much.  They were filled with some kind of mixture that I can only describe as reminiscent of tabouleh (I don't like tabouleh).  But if you are a fan, definitely go for that dish!  Again, the curry sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes.  It did have a nice spicy kick which I enjoyed.  The black/purple rice is a nice touch that makes this dish stand out from other curries you might have tried before!

After reading my Yelp friend Rick R's review, I knew that I would have to try this spot out.  I woke up Sunday and decided that I would head on down.  I parked out front, walked in, was seated at a table and placed my order.  I went with a cup of Won Ton Soup, an order of Egg Rolls (Free with Yelp check-in!  Score!), and an order of Orange Chicken.  I also ordered some Fried Rice.  Here is how everything was.............

Won Ton Soup-  This was only $1.50 a cup.  It had 2 won tons in it and a nice amount of green onions.  The flavor of this soup was good. The temperature though, was not.  The broth wasn't really hot and just kind of warm.  The won tons were good though..nice and soft and chewy.  If this soup would have been a little bit hotter in temperature, it would have been excellent.  

Egg Rolls-  What?  Free with Yelp check-in?  Yup!  Super stoked on that!  These things came out and they were massive!  Possibly the biggest egg rolls I have ever seen.  They are served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce.  The egg rolls were great!  Piping hot, fried perfectly, and stuffed with the usual egg roll ingredients.  These were really good and I would order them again even if they weren't free.  

Orange Chicken-  Orange chicken is usually a good ""test"" item.  If a place can make a decent/good orange chicken, their other dishes are usually pretty solid.  Happy to say, Wong's makes a really good orange chicken.  The batter is a bit different than most places I have had it at before.  It's a lighter batter, with a different texture.  Almost like a panko encrusted chicken. The sauce they use is sweet but not overpowering.  The pieces of chicken were cut thin too, and they absorbed all the sauce rather well.  I would definitely get this again.  It was even better heated up later on that night for seconds! 

Fried Rice-  I saw on the menu that a plain order of fried rice was only $3.00.  I thought that's what I was ordering.  Turns out, I was never charged for fried rice.  They included it as my rice side for my orange chicken!  Score!  The plain fried rice was very plain..just rice that had been fried pretty quick.  No veggies, no egg etc.  It was decent.  I have had better fried rice elsewhere, but the fact that it was included in my meal for no extra charge, gets bonus points on my end ;-).

Overall, I had a very good meal here!  Like I said with the chicken, I actually enjoyed my leftovers just as much as eating it there in the restaurant. I pretty much made 2 full meals for around $13.00. The portions were very big!  Also, the 2 ladies that waited on me were incredibly kind.  The main lady (cashier? owner?) was very friendly and asked me where I came from, how I heard about the Yelp check-in etc.  Very personable and made you feel at home!  I now know where to get good Chinese food in the West Valley!  I'm sure I will be back to try out some other dishes soon enough!",2016-06-07 06:47:18

In terms of the ambiance, it was the same with all Italian restaurants...Nothing good to write home about. But that wasn't what I was there for. 

Service was average. Forgot some of our orders of drinks and what not so had to order again, not a big deal. nothing really special 

In terms of the appetizer, we order the spinach and artichoke dip. This came with a slight difference. They didn't provide any chips, but thinly toasted bread. It wasn't my favorite combination, but it wasn't that bad. I would give the appetizer an average grade. 

The main course was pasta, what did you expect at an Italian restaurant. We ordered something that had some spice to it. It was pretty good. I can't remember the name of it, but it has chicken or some other type of meat in it....As you can tell, it wasn't that amazing or I would have remembered. 

The item that I really liked was the bread to start. They provided the bread with an olive oil and spice dip. I liked it so much that I had seconds, and I never have seconds of bread. We were lucky , according to our waitress, because they just finished baking/heating the bread. It was very soft and warm when it arrived. I should have just ordered a drink and ate the free bread....would have saved me some money.

From my experience, Goldspike is supposed to be an adult clubhouse (21+) where you will likely have to show your ID to prove it. On Weekends after 10PM they have a $10 cover charge for guys and everyone is asked to wear classy attire. When I went though, my dress code did not meet those standards and I was not given a hard time. Staff is pretty chill and the crowd can get pretty thick on Fridays and Saturdays. If that's not your thing, perhaps it would be better to come on a weeknight. 

The difference between coming on a weekday versus weekend is kind of crazy. Yes, this is Vegas, but it's not always a party here. The week days give you the chance to see how young adults have came and abused the luxuries of this establishment. The pool table's stained with beer with holes in the felt, the bathroom stalls don't close right, and the games you can rent are missing pieces.  I even saw a young man try to bounce a pool stick on a table. This place is the epitome of what you would expect to get when you give presents to ungrateful kids.

What hits you right away is the size of the place..it is quite huge with plenty of seating.
Our server was over fairly quickly after we sat down. I knew what I wanted but my dining companion wanted to peruse the menu to look at other dishes. Our waitress took our drink order and when she returned with them, we ordered our food.
Both us got the Halibut and chips (at $16/each) with two pops. 
After what I'd consider a normal wait-time, our food appeared. Our waitress asked if we'd like lemon or tartar sauce.....I opted for neither, my dining companion asked for tartar sauce. This is the reason for the loss of 1 star....the tartar sauce wasn't homemade...it was those plastic, sealed containers of tartar sauce that cheaper places offer you. To me, a place whose main business is fish, should go the extra mile and make their own tartar sauce.
Huge piece of halibut (the menu says 4oz) with a generous amount of home made fries. It was deeeelish !

I shared veggie kabob and rice, beef egg rolls, and chicken tikka masala. I'm happy to say that you get a ton of food with your order! The veggie kabobs were served on a huge bed of rice, and they were super fresh and flavorful. They're simple, but great! The egg rolls, which are only $0.99 a pop, were also very tasty, albeit a little greasy (they're deep-fried egg rolls though). I also can't forget to mention that the egg rolls come with a great spicy sauce! 

And then there was chicken tikka masala... At $10.99 it's not the cheapest thing on the menu, but DAMN! It was sincerely some of the best chicken tikka masala that I've had in the valley (almost inching out one of my favorites at Z-Grill). They served it with an enormous piece of house-made naan. The masala was perfectly balanced in spiciness and thickness, and the chicken was cooked just right! Masala lovers from all over should try it!

I didn't experience the friendliest service here, but it wasn't the worst either. After I paid, I waited about 3 minutes before they called me over to ask which toppings I'd like in my burrito. I got refried beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, tomato, green pepper, corn, mild salsa, and burrito sauce. I then took a seat and I was WOW'd.

* Salad was good - we had the spinach & Gorgonzola salad. 
* Pizza was really good, but too expensive. Plus, it was the thinner type so you wouldn't expect to pay that much.
* Wait staff - not good. 
* Ambiance - pretty nice. Has a NY type of feeling.
* Too pricey to go back

* Salad had too much dressing. It was dripping with the balsamic stuff. I don't like soppy lettuce.
* Pizza was just ok. It was served to us fairly quickly considering that the place was packed. However, it was not hot. Plus, we had to wave our server down to ask her to heat it up. She didn't seem very happy with us and did not offer an apology for the cold pie. After all, this place is called Humble Pie. 
* Wait staff - Not good. Not very forthcoming with the menu and only seemed to be interested in getting the ordering over with.
* The staff should be humble enough to ask the customer if everything is ok after the food is served. That never happened. Even when she brought over the check we got nothing. 
* Ambiance - too loud and dark! Tables and chairs are packed tight in this place so plan to share your space with others not in your party. 
* Definitely not going back.

This store is clean and well kept. The only negative is that it is a little overpriced, and u often see the same toys over and over; not a lot of new inventory or products. 

This place has been around since I was a kid. Such great memories!  When I was a kid they were popular mainly because they always carried super unique toys like pogo sticks and my all time fav, the ""flying turtle"" - no other toy stores carried these products at the time.  Nowadays they have more traditional toys that most toy stores carry. I wish they would start to carry more unique/ difficult to find toys. That is what truly set them apart from the competition previously.

No big sign that you can see from the street, but they are located next to Yama Sushi.  Right now they have all the LA chefs training the chefs at the moment, so run here now!

The menu is pretty large for a Monta owned place.  Of course, it is different because it's all about the udon noodles.  They freshly make the noodles and you can taste the difference!

The takoyaki is served in a hot plate and man was it delish. There were 3 of us and we could barely finish it.  

Up next, it's Bukkake...Teehee to that word, but in this case, it's you pouring your own soup into your udon bowl and whatever you order from this side of the menu, you can have it hot or cold.

I got myself the ikura bukkake. Never had anything like this, but I do love noodles and I do love ikura.  The combo didn't sound to pleasing, but it actually tasted good.

I honestly do not know how this restaurant claims to have won culinary awards. For quality of food, considering view and price point, it really can't hold a candle to Canoe. I had the salmon, which was passable, and my friend had the steak, which was fairly bland with an unfavourable texture. We also shared a completely unmemorable chocolate tower dessert, which looked much more impressive than it tasted. The wine was good enough, but that's fairly irrelevant to the kitchen.

HOWEVER, if you intend to go up the CN tower anyway it's surprisingly good value (-$30 each from your meal if you consider the cost of going into the CN tower), and is worth your while for the experience itself.

Yes, a walking garbage compactor... And, I love her still.... as long as she does not become Mrs Piggy times 10... :)  call me Kermit (yes, the green lovable fella).

Back to the review.  O.K.  This restaurant was a bit hard to find.  It is actually up on the second floor.  When you walk into the restaurant, it is very open, clean, and inviting.  It was a cool place.  I give Atmosphere a solid 4.

Service... well, let's say that our waitress started off strong.  Got us the water, the appetizers, and extras.  As the meal progressed, she kinda forgot about us.  We had to request more water, more food, and the check (we had to track her down).  I give this a 3.... should be lower, but she was sweet.

Now, for the food.  Well, for $19.99, you had all you can eat.  However, they provided you with the variety tray.  After you finish the variety tray, you can add more of the one's you like.  Personally, I do not like this.  There are just some items that we do not like to eat... instead of wasting them, we ended eating anyways.   I rather CHOOSE the selection.  Most Korean restaurant provides you with a buffet cart to pick from.  I was a bit sad to not see Galbee ribs.  They had boneless instead.  Trust me, one of the great joys of eating a Galbee rib is sucking on the bone.  Yes, a bit disgusting. sounds a bit ""gay"".  hey, I am married, I can say that without thinking otherwise...LOL... and, by the way, like the Seinfeld episode... nothing wrong with being gay... they just have a different preference... okay... moving on... the veggies and appetizers were good/average.

I'm not picky, but thats just a tad bit unprofessional.  The chips and salsa were great and my food tasted really good.

So why the bad review?  Food Poisoning...  The next 24 hours of my life after visiting Frank and Lupe's was horrendous.  I don't want to disparage a local business but after the experience with the margarita and my time in the emergency room, I can say I will never go back.

In Feb they had weekday (Tues to Fri) breakfast specials for less than 4 dollars.  You can get waffles, pancakes, or French toast paired with eggs for less than what you would pay at Denny's.  The food is not elevated, high-end cuisine by any means but for the value you're getting a great home cooked breakfast.  The biscuits were also definitely good paired with the gravy.

The reason I can't give it 4 or 5 stars is based on service.  Now typically I don't really care about service as long as it's not horrible and if I get good food. If service were better I d give it 4 stars tops.  We came on a Sun with only one other table.  The server couldn't multi-task worth sh1t and neither could the cook who was apparently working his first shift.  They were nice though I have to say.

If I lived closer I would frequent more often and may come to find that this visit was an outlier to what type of service you would expect and thus my rating would be higher.  

If you're in the area - check this place out. You really can't beat the value - no item is over 9 dollars with most items being 5-6 dollars.  My guess is this is more along the lines of 4 stars but I came on a bad day.",2014-03-02 21:28:57

Well, almost everything, except for Grand Cafe.

Like it's weaker sister location at the Green Valley Ranch (http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2), Grand Cafe is the lowest end of the dining totem pole.  Yes, even lower than FatBurger and most other chains in the resort, because at the very least even they can consistently crank out tolerable food.  Couple that with some other major service snafus and it's not hard to see this cafe is already on the downward spiral.

Since Grand Cafe is 24 hours, it's typically the source for room service food.  If you're going to order for your room, you should save the trouble and try another casino dining establishment instead - your stomach and your wallet will thank you.

Service has always been lackluster at best.  My many visits here both late night and early morning have been with wait staff who seem more apathetic than not.  It might just be my bad luck but I've lost count from how many service related issues I've had with my food.  Management needs to start hiring from the same pool of folks that are staffed in other establishments or the quality will continue to suffer.

And with regards to the quality of the food, something is almost always off.  Breakfast foods have been bland and dry, salads have been uninspiring, even burgers and sandwiches were disappointing.  Casual dining isn't supposed to be this hard.  To offer any suggestions outside of getting a new kitchen and wait staff may prove to be too difficult.  But they could certainly use the help.

After you've paid you get to dress up you burger to your wishes at the full condiment bar. Good experience for kids too.

Spices re-opens for dinner at 4:30pm and unfortunately the rice wasn't done being cooked when I arrived around 4:50pm. I was given an expected time of about 15-20 minutes. I wasn't able to wait but in the back of my mind thought that they should've had it ready to go 20 minutes after re-opening. I'm not sure if this is an everyday thing or if they were just running behind on the day I went.

Anyways, I decided to still get the Chicken Shawarma plate which came with the shawarma, a small salad, french fries, and pita bread along with tahini sauce. I have to hand it to them for packing probably one of the best to-go boxes I've ever gotten! Pictures of the packing are posted! The salad (mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, & onions) was in a small container and the chicken shawarma was wrapped separately so the juices from both didn't mix together in the box and get the fries all soggy. The only thing I didn't like from the meal was the fries because they were way too salty. Also the tahini sauce was really bitter, but the chicken was flavorful enough and tasted great as a ""wrap"" in the pita with some salad that I didn't even need that sauce. I will ask for tzatsiki next time though!

The price of the meal was fair. Considering how tasty everything was, I'd go back to try the rice & arrive at a later time to make sure I get it!",2015-12-09 23:28:20

*****************************


I just bought a new Quest. This review is only on the sales and finance department since I haven't dealt with service yet. 

My hubby and I were shopping around last week for a new minivan, but other options were considered. We looked at Toyota, Jeep, and Kia. We also went to Hyundai because they've always been great for us. After some pretty bad experiences at those other dealers, I convinced my hubby to look at Nissan. We went to the dealership on a Sunday so we could look around without a salesman following us around. We liked what we saw ( through the windows) and put a email in to their internet sales guy Dave Adolph. He got back to us Monday morning. We went down to see the van shortly after talking to Dave on the phone. He greeted us right away. He was very easy going, and good with our kids. We made a deal quickly, and got all the rebates on the van. There were no scams or hidden fees. Everything was straight forward. 

My hubby worked with Steve in finance. I didn't get to meet him since I had to go to work, but my husband said he was great. He basically printed the docs, hubby wrote a check and drove away in our new family hauler. 

It was a pretty great experience, for buying a car. We would definitely recommend Dave Adolph to anyone going to Desert Nissan. He doesn't do high pressure sales. We knew what we wanted and he didn't try to get us looking at anything else.",2017-06-23 00:25:52

This location of Jessie Raes BBQ is inside a local bar. So I sat at the gambling machine while I waited for my food (about 15 min) to go. I can't imagine enjoying BBQ as good as Jessie Raes at this location. The ambiance just doesn't feel right for me. I can't wait until they open their own dine in restaurant!!

The food: Even BETTER than I remember the first time (at the other location)!!

I don't usually order chicken but my husband did and I literally did not touch my ribs until I was done mooching off his chicken..or whatever he had left of it!!! It was probably the BEST BBQ CHICKEN I ever had.

The ribs were just as amazing smoked to perfection and fall off the bone! 

My husband also really enjoyed the smoked sausage.

The only thing different was the buttered corn. It didn't have that amazing smoked butter. I was kinda bummed about that since that's what I loved the first time around. Maybe they ran out??

Still a nice small shop. Seating are very close to one another especially in the alcove near the door. Decorations were dated for sure. Prices have gone up for sure too. 

Nevertheless, food quality remains simple and tasty. My partner had the chicken sikar and I had the hyala. The chicken sikar was tasty. The sauce on the chicken is even better. Since there wasn't enough sauce, we asked for more and they obliged by cooking just the sauce. That's service!

Hyala is a soup Mader's with minced bison meat. I can't tell the difference between that and minced beef of pork. The soup is made with fresh ingredients and has a clear broth. There is also a certain fragrant that I can't pinpoint. A pleasant one though. 

Anyway, as others have noted, this is a cash or check place. No CC. Maybe Yelp can have a special icon for these places. A small, decent restaurant tucked into the middle of state st. I probably won't be returning anytime soon but I hope it won't be another 30 years.",2017-02-01 05:29:06

Environment:
Pretty much steps from the North York Centre subway station, so the restaurant is pretty easily accessible by commuters. 
Walking in the restaurant, they have a dessert section near the entrance, which is a collaboration with another restaurant that sells many Japanese matcha desserts. The ramen restaurant itself is ok size with some single tables on the sides, and a big communal bar table in the middle with uncomfortable bar stools. It is recommended that you come in a group of 4 of fewer to minimize the wait time, and I think the largest group size they can accommodate right now is 6.

Food:
The ramens average $13-14 for the soft opening menu, desserts about $5-7, and sides about $5. I got the Shio Ramen ($14) with Chicken Karaage ($5) on the side. 
The Chicken Karaage came first and my goodness the portion was tiny, that it was 4 pieces of chicken about the same size as chicken nuggets. Taste wise it was so average as well, nothing stood out, which totally didn't justify the high price. 
The Shio Ramen broth had an interesting flavour: the soup was pretty light but had a sweet taste with a hint of bitterness due to the clamp. Not exactly my cup of tea considering that I prefer my soup creamy. Other than that the ramen was very lackluster and the portion was small. It only contained noodles, 3 slices of Chashu, and a few pieces of bamboo shoot. So basically what I was paying for was the brand name, because certainly, the ingredients didn't cost very much. 

Service:
Since the restaurant opened not too long ago, many people were eager to try it, so the line was pretty long even though I came on a Wednesday night. We waited for about 30 mins for a table for 4, but the waiter was quite nice at updating us the status of the tables and offered to split our group up if we wanted to be seated faster. During the actual dining experience, the waiter would periodically come to refill our water. 
Since this was their soft opening period they didn't have any machines set up so it was cash only. They just so happened to mess up my change and gave me $4 short, which I definitely wasn't too thrilled about

Overall, I guess the ramen was alright, but it was too plain and too light for my taste, and I quite lacked the toppings. Personally, I would much prefer going to Sansotei and Santouka, which have more food at or below the price, so I don't see myself coming again.",2017-12-23 02:40:07

What we didn't love, was the lousy service - so when I went back last night, I was hopeful for a better experience. Boy, was I wrong. While the food was good, the service was worse than the first time I went. The manager barely acknowledged us when we arrived, and 'friendly' isn't how I would describe him. He came off as a little arrogant and indifferent. After taking us to our table and asking us if we wanted to check our coats, he left (while our coats sat on a neighbouring table) and never came back. After waiting 10-15 minutes for some kind of acknowledgement, someone finally came by to ask if we wanted to order ; they didn't offer us water, ask if we wanted drinks or even tell us what the daily specials were, if any. Seriously? We told the waiter we'd like a drink which took another 10 minutes to arrive. We then were told that someone new would wait our table. It took at least 20-30 minutes before we were able to order our dishes - and we had to call the girl over twice AND ask for the specials/tell her we were hungry. All the while, there were about 6-7 waiters/waitresses hanging around the bar chatting -some of them looked over once in a while and of course, completely ignored us. My friend and I did notice, however, that the wait staff (including our bad waitress) hovered around the other tables - which lead us to believe that because we LOOK young, the wait staff didn't deem us 'worthy' of their service. Part of the dining out experience is the service - Ferreira failed twice, on this count, and I won't be going back regardless of how good the food might be.

My first concert here was for Tracy Bonham with Aqualung back in 2006. Then, in April 2014, I saw Foster the People. Comparing the Marquee from 2006 to 2014, not much has changed. The parking is the same, the outside is the same, the stage is the same, and the concert goers are the same. You get the picture. The only difference I noticed was the entrance where the bar is. That has definitely been remodeled/expanded (or I am more aware of it now that I can drink). 

Overall, it's a decent theater. It's on the small side compared to other theaters I've been to, but this isn't a bad thing. The bathrooms were decent and everything seemed pretty clean upon first glance. Inside the actual theater there is absolutely no seating - standing room only. This is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because you can stand, sit, or dance wherever you want. A curse because other people can stand, sit, or dance wherever they want and eventually they will dance their way into your space. This happened quite frequently and plenty of folks started to encroach in my space. Could be worse, I guess. Another thing I noticed was that the floors were sticky and gross. I saw folks sitting down and worried about their health. 

Otherwise, no real complaints. If another band I wanted to see was playing here, there would be no hesitation to get tickets.",2014-05-31 07:13:28

It was about 7:30 and the place was pretty crowded but not totally packed.  I've never been here before so I made a reservation earlier in the day but I don't think we needed one.  Better safe than sorry I guess.

Everything about this place screams coolness.  From the decor to the waiters to the people there.  The place is pretty swank but not so over the top that it is a turn-off.  Anyway, it is a super cool and chill place to hang.

As for the food, here is what I tried:

* Black Truffle Hummus = I thought this was just ok.  You could definitely taste the truffle but I found the truffle/hummus combination a bit odd.
* Panko Crusted Goat Cheese = Also ok but nothing special.  Basically just fried balls of goat cheese.
* Grilled Wedge = This was excellent and unique.
* Parc Central Burger = This was tender, juicy and delicious.  It was perfectly cooked and of a decent size.  The fries were also very good.

This place is a bit pricey but not too over the top.  Everything was quality and combined with the ""coolness"" factor it was worth it.

I have probably mentioned that my family eats more Chinese food then some Chinese families, yes? It's only after we moved to Toronto that I go to Korean restaurants so often cause they are actually good. When we lived in Vancouver, we never ever even thought to go eat at Korean restaurants. So the weekend comes and we are trying to decide on where to eat? Chinese food!

After couple recommendations from people, I decided to check out Maple Yip. I was warned that this restaurant is not very non-chinese friendly but we went with a friend who can speak the language to help us out, Yay!

Ordered: Braised Pork belly with preserved vegetables

* Fatty pork pieces cooked with chopped up vegetables
* The entire dish is marinated so I like to eat this with rice
* Porkbelly is so tender and soft it melts in your mouth
* This is my dad's favorite dish and is sold in Korea as well but very pricy!!

Ordered: Lobster

* We ordered small lobster since we wanted to try other dishes
* This was decent but nothing special
* To be honest the lobster was so small there wasn't much to eat

Ordered: Snow Pea Leaf (Dai Miu)

* This is my favorite type of Chinese vegetable
* Usually stir fried with bit of garlic, it's suttle in terms of flavor 
* You can sometimes order this at Dim Sum places as well

Ordered: Roasted Quail/Pigeon

* I first tried this at my friend's birthday dinner
* The meat is dark and quite gamey

Ordered: MaPo Tofu

* Pretty standard dish at Chinese restaurants
* It wasn't made very spicy and had overall mild flavor

Ordered: Spicy deep fried porkchops

* Porkchop pieces are cut up and then deep fried, sprinkled with chili and salt
* This is overall very dry but it came hot and crispy
* Chili flakes kick in a little after

Summary: Maple Yip is a solid chinese restaurant that serves good, quality food. It is a little far from where I live so it does take a bit of travel time but heck, if you want good asian food- you gotta travel uptown.",2012-09-17 19:52:45

Initially tried to get $100 presale tickets when they first came out but, they sold out immediately. Like, 15 minutes past the start time immediate. 
Once the LIB weekend started and I heard/saw many pics from the event, I figured I'd try to see what was available for Sunday (the last day) on Craigslist.
Needless to say, I found steal of a deal from a group from LA who were selling tix for $40.

I was worried about the parking so I left my car at Cosmo and had a friend drop me off to DTLV. We took the side roads and it was, surprisingly, easy going traffic. Cops and officials told me that the last day was probably slower because people had to travel back home.

Everyone walking to the entrance of LIB made me feel like one with the festival-goers. We walked into various murals on the walls of various parking lots, restaurants, buildings, and even motels in Downtown. Some of which were prolly abandoned before LIB.

Met up with my boyfriend and his friends who are avid festival-goers. The phone reception in Downtown was next to none so, we arranged a ""met up spot!"" Once I met them, I put my phone on airplane to save battery and just took pics and video all night.

Missed Jonelle Monae and J5 but, was able to enjoy Zedd, Danny Brown, and Vegas' very own, The Killers.

Along with the music, the food had to be the best music festival food ever...according to the bf and his friends. Restaurants like Honey Salt, Blue Ribbon Sushi, and RM Seafood were there. It was quite ridic to have this amazing food......at a music fest.....in downtown....Las Vegas.....

Weather was perfect. Sunny, cool, and breezy. PERFECTION!
The vibe at LIB was fun, pleasurable, and just magical. 
Amazing to see what's happening to DTLV thanks to Downtown Project =)

If I'm out for the evening, I know that my boyfriend will probably order the Cantonese Chow Mein for dinner. If we can't decide what to eat and one of us is tired, we order Bamboo Buddha. Usually, our food arrives within 15 minutes (we live close) and is hot and tasty. The drivers are always very friendly and we always tip them at least $5.

If Thursday, August 20th was the first time we had ordered from them, we would never have ordered from there again, because the food was absolutely disgusting and took over an hour to arrive.

When we called, they said they were out of egg rolls. What? How does a Chinese Restaurant run out of egg rolls? They're not making them fresh. Okay, so we get the spring rolls. On their website they advertise a special each night of the week if you pay cash. It's a different free item each day. Thursdays were wontons. When we placed the order, we were told that now, they only offer 2 spring rolls every day of the week. As regular customers this is a little disappointing.

I think the fact that our food must have been in the car for almost an hour steaming in a container may have led to the poor quality, but after waiting as long as we did, were were shocked at how bad everything was. Even the chicken balls, which are hard to fuck up, were a little soggy and tasted like cardboard.

The Shanghai noodles with Chicken and shrimp tasted like worms-- the noodles had absolutely no firmness to them at all and the meat all tasted the same.

The worst was the cashew pork. Even the cashews were soggy. The pork, which had been deep fried and then sitting in a container forever, tasted like it was breaded in unmixed wallpaper paste. 

Even the fried rice tasted bad.

I don't know what happened on this particular night, but if we had not ordered from them so often in the past and had solid experiences, we would never be ordering from them again. I pity anyone who decided to try them for the first time on this night because the food was horribly subpar. It's never been gourmet, but always reliable and fresh.

I'll be upping my review again after the next time we order, but until then, they're getting one star for the food that we paid over $30 for, waited an hour for and basically threw most of it in the trash.

Their pulled pork sandwich is pretty darn good.
We got their special pizza - bacon, potato, egg, and some other stuff I don't remember - it was really good, but it was a bit salty. Cause of the cheese. No marinara sauce with this one. 
Also the farmer's bread. Dang, the honey butter and apple butter. SO GOOD. Omg I love. I want to make my own honey butter now.

Also, I really like their seating area. They have some outdoor seating and seats that are inside but by the open window so it's both in and out. It's great. Also, the wait staff is really nice.

Every time I walk outside all I can smell is the wood burning oven and the pizza.  Everyone rants and raves that they have the best wood oven pizza.  I am Italian and have tried my fair share of Wood oven pizza.  After hearing all these comments I figured that seeing how hard it is to find a good real Italian pizza I MUST try it.

The server was very forgetful and somewhat sarcastic.  Kind of a turn off to begin with.  I was with a group and we ordered a few apps which were very good ill give the apps 4 stars.  Lets get to the pizza.  I was so excited only to be LET DOWN.  The pizza has NO taste what so ever.  I felt like I was eating plain dough.  Lacking salt.  Toppings had no taste.  I can rant and rave all day but I think you get the point.

My girlfriend got the gnocchi which were very very good ill give them 5 stars.  Should have got the gnocchi.  Everyone that ordered something other then pizza was happy

I will go back but will NOT be getting the pizza.  Weather or not I return after that will be determined after my second visit.

Hubby and I met up for a Friday lunch and it was a lovely time!  We sat in the bar area and our hostess made a point to let me know about the purse hooks under the table.  Good touch, though it would be even better if they were a little more off to the side.  We had a good view of a few TVs, but not in an overbearing way like in a sports bar.

We started with the California Roll, which greatly satisfied my pregnant lady sushi needs.  I'm not sure what the sauce on the side was, but it had good flavor.  I definitely appreciated that it wasn't a sad 5-piecer, it was actually a good size to split.  My entree was the BBQ White Cheddar Burger.  It was tall, delicious, and next to a pile of really good fries.  I enjoyed it with a cold, tall coke and it made for a great lunch.  For dessert we split the Cream Brule√© - it was also large enough to split, so I love that.  

Our server got a little busy toward the end of our meal so we saw her less frequently as we tried to settle the bill, but the lunch crowd arrived all at once so it was understandable.

The food was tasty and well prepared, but nothing really stood out for me.  I started with the Caesar salad, which was just ok, kinda pale and dull in comparison to other Caesar salads that I've had.  I'm used to deep green romaine lettuce and a rich tangy dressing.   It was good but not memorable.   I ordered the short rib entree as my main course.  The short ribs were tender, (a bit fatty) and served with small squares of au gratin potatoes and a few brussel sprouts.  The plate was artfully presented with the alternating servings of short rib and potatoes displayed on the plate.  The short rib was served in a delightful forest mushroom reduction.   I would have loved more brussel sprouts on the plate.   Once again, the entree was good, but not memorable.  We shared the baked hot chocolate dessert, which was probably the highlight of the meal.  Rich, dense, warm and chocolately.  Service was pretty good, our server was a bit awkward and standoffish, but all in all this was a good meal.  I'm not sure that meal was worth this price point.

The food was okay, a little on the bland side, but nothing was wrong with it.  The prices are a bit high for what you get, but I guess that's the turnaround plan.

In addition to the building, their staff is some of the most helpful and friendly that you can find anywhere. In addition to their human staff, they also employ a canine greeter. I was told some guests have had the opportunity to walk her while visiting the property.

On each floor, they have an ice machine and a filtered water machine. You can take advantage of the filtered water instead of paying for the bottled water in the mini bar.

Their cleaning staff did an excellent job during our stay organizing every detail in the room perfectly for our return.

The property has some high energy efficiency standards, which may not be appealing if you like having a cold hotel room. I had the temperature set to 65 on the thermostat (the lowest they allow) and it didn't get cooler over time. Many nights were spent without blankets.

We ordered food service twice during our visit with varied success.

For breakfast, we had corned beef hash and eggs benedict. Both dishes were not as expected. The corned beef was ground beef (not corned) covered with fried potato strings. The eggs benedict consisted of 2 poached eggs and 2 pieces of ham, with no English muffin and no hollandaise sauce as you'd traditionally expect with the dish.

Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.

My friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.

My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.

With each variation of dog named after a pooch of their own, or one of a friend, as I was told by one of the workers while I waited the cart serves up approximately half a dozen signatures plus daily specials, and a build your own option all atop pillowy flatbread (think pita, but with a more open and airy crumb) and although many sounded good none sounded on par with the ""Bear"" - a dish called 'stupid good' by a trusted palate and on first seeing, then tasting the concoction a very fair assessment.

Described on the menu as ""Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce"" and in my case tinged with a bit of spice from the all-pork Brat this $6 concoction literally hits every part of the palate like a sweet, salty, crunchy, fatty, creamy, and spicy sledgehammer.  Whimsical and fun but decidedly not an everyday indulgence it's the sort of dish that could assuredly fail under many circumstances and fall under the absurdities or Man vs. Food category, but instead it just works beautifully - a dish that would not be out of place at any number of haute hotdog purveyors in other major cities and more than enough reason to give Short Leash another taste at a later date.",2012-12-11 12:58:41

Whenever I'm asked for a resort suggestion, Hyatt is in my top three. Why, you ask? Because the minute I step through the doors, I've left Arizona and traveled to a tropical oasis. 

Every time I stay at the Hyatt, it's an experience and not just a place to rest my sleepy eyes. The grounds have everything from spacious seating areas, large and beautiful palm trees, a cocktail lounge that serves tasty drinks and a huge grassy courtyard in the middle of the hotel with plenty of water fountains all around. It's the perfect setting to enjoy some cocktails or food on a nice night. If I close my eyes, I catch a whiff of the floral scents, listen to the running water and feel the breeze. 

The pool alone deserves five stars. I believe I should actually say ""pools."" I think the Hyatt has one of the best pools in all of Phoenix. Ten pools, a sand beach, water slide, water ""temples,"" private smaller pools and even a lake where guests can take a gondola ride. With the water activities alone, staying at the Hyatt is the perfect experience. In addition to the enormous water options, the Hyatt also has a top of the line spa and golf. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and nestled within the hotel so that when you look outside you see seasoned trees and greenery. 

I love the food at the Hyatt. They have one of the best Chicken Cesar salads I've had. I think it has something to do with the dressing. The service is by far excellent. The staff's attentive and friendly. With plenty of places to sit and relax, you can order a drink or some food and find plenty of places to enjoy it. I love hotels where I don't feel cramped like I'm sharing my experience with 100 other people and here, the grounds provide enough space so that I have the option to stay a bit more isolated and enjoy my stay.

Its an okay place to hang out friends, but there a couple things lacking. Overall a pricier location for 'bubble tea', but you do get some better ingredients (or so they say). 

Had the Popcorn Chicken here today, and it wasn't as good as I remembered it. It was a bit bland and didn't have much of a punch to it, and the sauce it came with was too sweet to match. They also added a Chocolate Lava Cake (which doesn't go with the theme of a 'tea' place), but it takes 20min of waiting time, and wasn't all that great.
Drinks were alright, but its paying almost $10 or more for 1 drink, so either pace yourself or you'll end up thirsty again before you leave. 

Service here isn't terrible, but does leave something to be desired. Seems kind of difficult to wave down any hostess/server, and when you do, they don't really seem like they understand... My friend also said one time she waited almost 2 hrs for food & drinks, whereas I needed to explain in excruciating detail what cake was in order to get some that was supposed to come with a meal.

XZO_hWUoCafeCToit8ZViw,lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,gGS9Os0UBBO8BosD3VnwqQ,3,3,2,2,"Delucia's is decent enough for me to have lunch here on a semi-consistent basis without much complaint.  The biggest factor is convenience, since it is very close to work.  They also have a $6.95 special for two slices of cheese pizza and a salad.  

Pizza here is good, but doesn't stand out as anything exceptional.  Pizza is just a bit thicker than what I would call a New York Style, and the crust is thick and crunchy.  The salad is quite a generous portion, enough so that sometimes I'll be eating it until I finish my pizza even though it is brought out first.  You have your greens, onions, tomato, croutons and dressing of your choice.

So with the price point and big salad you get for the $6.95 deal, Delucia's falls short of getting another star because of the service.  There are good days where I can be in and out in 30 minutes.  Other times, it will take 25 minutes for our drinks and salad to be brought out.  Pizza wait time is hit or miss as well, since I've had it come out with the salad or when I was finishing up my salad.

I'd never go out of my way for Delucia's, but if you're in the area and need a decent lunch, this is definitely one of the better options around.",2011-04-30 23:07:15

Anyways, we were seated....let the show begin! Ok wait, they took our orders first and came out with our salads. I must say the salads were very tasty....loved the dressing. Yessss!!!! Ok...let the show begin!!!!!!
We had so much fun with our cook, with his slicing and dicing skills. He was even giving me food, that I didn't order...he said come on just try it. I said ok....sure! And it was tasty! I did order the chicken, veggie, and rice hibachi....extra sauce please. Oh the sauce is to die for!!!! Ahhhmazing!
He did a cute little hat fire trick. I must admit that I was a little nervous for himself and possibly our lives too. But we didn't need to call the fire department.

The sandwich was much better than any of the other Turkey/cranberry sandwiches I've had around town; probably because of the delicious bread and the melted cheese.

Found a couple clean CDs, such as Kool and the Gang and the Scintas, which is an act on the Las Vegas Strip, formerly from Atlantic City.

I could not tell you how happy I was to find these gems.

One man's trash is certainly another man's treasure.

I played the cds in my car the rest of my trip and on my way home. 

30 songs for $2!  So much cheaper than Apple's iTunes. lol

I'll be back again for sure if in the area. 

If you're in the mood for some treasure hunting, I'm telling you there's nothing else like it.

The name of the Japanese restaurant is Shuseki and we were thrilled to make the discovery since from the street you wouldn't see it nestled in southwest corner of the first floor. Though the decor is unexciting and kind of tacky with amateur pictures of specials on the wall, our hostess/waitress was polite and efficient and we immediately felt comfortable. The first thing that appealed to me when we sat down was the layout of the menu, which has mini pictures of each dish so you know exactly what you're getting. I love to be adventurous in ordering, but it's always great to know you'll be spending money on something you'll enjoy. Also, because the pictures are small, it is easy enough to look at every dish so you can make your selection amongst the 179 items.

Since they have a sushi bar we decided to order hamachi sashimi to see how fresh their fish was. The sashimi ($7.99 for 5 pieces) was not the best I'd ever had, but it was certainly fresh and had a subtle but good flavor. The rolls all looked pretty drab and mainstream, so we decided against ordering any of them, even though the prices were reasonable. After the sashimi we had two dishes prepared in a way I had previously thought was only done at Raku, the authentic and superb Japanese restaurant down the street. These were what I like to call ""Japanese tapas,"" or mini items that are cooked on a robata grill. We had the Bacon and Asparagus (#64, $1.50) and the Korobuta Sausage (#67, $1.50), both of which were excellent and a terrific value. Though the selection of items like these isn't as wide as it is at Raku, the prices are lower and the quality is comparable.

The real show stopper of the meal was the Spicy Pork Miso Ramen soup (#151, $7.99). This soup was so richly flavored and delicious (yet still light) that we found it nearly impossible to put down our spoons. The spicy ground pork, miso, and ample sprinkling of sesame seeds enhanced the broth tremendously, and the bean sprouts, scallions, and coddled egg gave added texture. The noodles added another dimension, and were fresh and chewy (not at all overcooked). Ramen noodles are wheat based noodles, which I personally prefer to rice noodles because they can stand up to the temperature of a big bowl of hot soup for a longer period of time. In my opinion, they also taste better. This soup was the best I've had in a long time, and ranks up there in comfort with my mom's chicken matzo ball soup. Unlike Jewish penicillin, however, this soup has some heat, which is great for clearing your nostrils of all the nasty pollen this time of year. If you are not a spice lover, they have seven other kinds of ramen to choose from, as well as four kinds of udon. I can't vouch for any of these, but based on what we had I'd be willing to try any of them.",2010-03-26 15:53:45

However, the things they sell here are super authentic and many of them are imported directly from Japan.

J-Town not only as a supermarket there for some general groceries, they also have a food court and some cafes, and also a beauty store for Japanese skin care and makeup. I'm here predominantly for the food and I like how I can find some really neat Japanese snacks and cooking ingredients that I can't find at other Asian supermarkets. Their meat section is amazing and everything there looked really fresh. Some of the meats are quite pricey though but it's reasonable for the quality that it is (there are Kobe beef made from North American raised cows).

The food court is meh in my opinion, not really a huge fan of their noodles and curries. It's pretty average in terms of taste and the portion isn't very big for the price you pay. Their pastries and cakes are a lot better though and I highly suggest you get some for takeout.

We came here for lunch one day after purchasing their LivingSocial deal. Cafe Monte is a cute little eatery with yummy sweet treats and some pretty serious savory eats. It was pretty packed for a weekday. 

I love how they have incorporated smoked salmon into multiple dishes, yum! We sat down right away, I already knew I wanted the lobster crepes or the salmon Benedict. I ended up going with the lobster while the bf ordered the pepper and sausage pizza. The server was a little pushy on trying to get us to purchase drinks, sides and dessert. She wasn't really my cup of tea as it was very obvious she wasn't interested in LivingSocial customers. 

Our food took a while to bring out and it was so hard to wait, we were starving. Finally we got our food, my boyfriend thought the pizza looked really weird with the peppers and sausage bunched in the middle instead of evenly distributed throughout. There was also no sauce! Me no likey. My crepes tasted really good but I was not particularly happy about the little bits of lobster shell hidden in my dish. I had to be careful not to crack a crown on a potential piece of shell. I ate my meal since I figured I would have to wait an eternity to get a new dish but had let the waitress know. She wasn't too apologetic nor did she try to find a solution to my problem. I told her to let the chef know to be more careful preparing the shelled seafood from now on.

But the music. Others hear a snappy tune. To me it's just piercing screams, blood-curdling caterwauling. Shrill sounds make me cringe. I struggle to overcome the urge to howl. The fight-or-flight response starts to kick in. The heat is cranked up to about 85. Blasts of hot air bear down on me like a blowtorch. As I grab items from the shelves, the mounting discomfort weighs on me. I'm growing ill-tempered.

When you step up to the checkout at this Trader Joe, the first thing the checker does is hand you a slip of Trader Joe receipt paper to write your name & phone number. That enters you in the weekly drawing to win a $25 gift card. It's a special drawing for those who recycle shopping bags or bring their own. 

This guy didn't give me the entry slip. I'm fighting to hold the remnants of a good mood. Swiping my credit card, I mention the drawing.  ""I suppose you want me to give you some paper,"" he says. I'm getting testy. He hands me a bit of paper from the receipt machine. Trader Joe employees tend to be cheerful and helpful. How did I end up with this douche? Why me? 

While I fill out the slip, the lady behind me in line is crowding me. I don't like being crowded. I grab my groceries and start to leave. The checker gives me a look of wide-eyed bewilderment. ""YOU HAVE TO PAY!"" He's shocked. This is the first time he's confronted a criminal. 

Shit. I know I swiped my card. What the hell? Bad swipe! I have to step back to the credit card terminal and swipe again. Now I feel really stupid and annoyed. 

The lady beside me grimaces and clears her throat. I mock her.

""Ahem! Ahem! Sorry for the inconvenience,"" I snarl.

""I wasn't being rude,"" she says. ""I have bronchitis and I was just clearing my throat."" Damn, she does look sickly. A pathetic old creature.

Right about here is where the voice comes in: WANT TO GET AWAY?

The checker glares at me like I'm a monster. I bolt. 

Normal people aren't fazed by hideous music, blasting heat, people crowding them, or checkers with attitude. They can laugh off a bad swipe. To a normal person, that vile hag was just a harmless grandma. Is there rehab for guys like me?",2010-01-31 18:34:08

Once I relocated here, I was on the hunt for a bakery that specializes in scones. Lo and behold! This bakery has soooo many flavors and types. They have a card you can pick up with the list of the kinds. I had a cranberry orange scone while my boyfriend had a salted caramel. Both awesome with great texture and with a side of small cube of butter. I also had a pretty latte to go with it! They have some shelves that sell jars of ingredients to make your own scone, cool tea packets, indian spices for butter chicken etc.

Baker and Scone also offers classes and high tea, which I asked the girl who worked there. She opened the binder and showed me the upcoming classes! They run about minimum 80/person, pricey, but hey if you happen to have the dough and are looking for something to do, this is a good idea! All schedules are on the website. So take a look!

I always forget what a shitshow parking in Old Town can be (It's like I've blacked out the memories of living near there like a PTSD victim) so word to the wise: take advantage of their valet.

First impression: This place is tiny and CUTE! As a few other reviews have mentioned, the majority of seating options are outdoors. I hope this doesn't deter business in the blazing hot months that are just weeks away (sob), but with ample tree coverage, tons of umbrellas and hopefully a strong mister system, I think evenings out on this back patio will still be pleasant in the summer.

We started off splitting the farro salad, which was a tasty mixture of perfectly-cooked farro, roasted cauliflower, diced tomatoes and arugula/herbs all tossed together. It comes with a charred lemon half for squeezing over the whole thing, which is a refreshing touch. The menu doesn't mention cauliflower and tomatoes at all, so just an FYI. (Fiance doesn't LOVE cauliflower, so it would have been nice to know about.)

For mains we chose the vegan ramen with tofu (for me, obviously) and the Little Havana sandwich. The ramen bowl was outstanding! Deliciously spiced tofu, a variety of mushrooms and a ton of other veggie mix-ins all made for a tasty (and huge; I tried my hardest but I think there was still half left) bowl. The ""Little"" Havana was a not-so-little take on the Cuban that got rave reviews. We decided to split a side of fries...because who cares?! They were hand-cut and I couldn't stop dipping into the bowl long after I was full. Clearly, portions are great here.

First time we both got the Bahamas Dogs, his with the grilled Polish sausage, mine with a grilled Hebrew National hot dog.  Both were delicious though I personally will stick with the Hebrew Nationals.  I like the fact that they serve the cheese sauce on the side - a bit on the dog, a bit to dip fries in.  Cole slaw was a touch bland, fries and onion rings were just fine.

Second time, I tried the New Yorker with Hebrew National grilled, he got the Chicago with Polish Sausage.  I loved the New Yorker.  Though real sauerkraut is usually a touch more tangy, I thought it was the right balance with the spicy mustard and the red onion.  I'll have a hard time not ordering this one.  I loved the peppers on the Chicago but it wouldn't be my first choice.  

Their buns are awesome.  The consistency and flavor of the grilled Hebrew Nationals was spot on - a little crisp and smoky.  One is enough for a meal (but they're pretty cheap and delicious so two people would probably want to split three).

We got take out both times so I can't comment on much else.

It sounded a little odd, but the herb flavor worked really well. I was only able to sample little bits of the others since I was driving, but everything I tried was tasty and refreshing.

The front of the brewery is really fun. They have games including darts, Nintendo, and shuffleboard. This made it easy to hang out for a few hours while enjoying our drinks.

It was with great excitement that I noticed their preopening announcement, and we set out to try them for a weekend lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, we noted a clean Spartan aesthetic but the wooden benches were quite hard and mildly uncomfortable. The menu was simple and straightforward. We asked the waitress what the Tatsu ramen was, and she explained it is their tonkotsu with additional chashu (6 vs 2 pieces). We went ahead and ordered the tonkotsu ($7.77) and Tatsu ($10.77) ramen. Our bowls came out quickly and were accompanied by seaweed, ginger, a tiny bit of green onion and sesame, but no egg. Surprisingly, there didn't seem to be an option to add an egg, or other accompaniments, i.e. additional green onion, corn, etc. Interestingly, the shio and shoyu versions appear to come with an egg though.

While it looked promising initially with the proper thin white ramen noodles, our experience was underwhelming. First off, the noodles were overcooked and not al dente or firm enough. While the amount of noodles was adequate, the amount of broth was on the skimpy side and could have been served hotter. (Usually the better ramen joints serve their broth piping hot so that it is still plenty warm by the time you're finishing your meal.) The porky flavor and richness of the broth was ok but not something you would want to slurp up every last drop of. The chashu was not quite tender enough, a bit too fatty (that I was compelled to pick off the fatty parts), and somewhat bland at the same time. It was also odd that when I asked for shichimi togarashi (Japanese chili powder and a classic condiment), they only had chili oil available.

In the end, Ramen Tatsu was just okay for us. It is better than much of the local competition, but doesn't induce any cravings to return.",2013-06-30 01:00:20

Had the Cal Italia pizza. I enjoyed the offbeat sweet/tangy/salty take on traditional pizza. This pizza is for the curious and adventurous. It was good, and I'm glad I tried it but now it's checked off the list, I wouldn't order this as my standard.

Some at out table were into just plain old good pizza, so we also ordered the Chicago Crisp Michigan Ave. It was well received. The thin crust was great!

The service was off. They were changing shifts, so our server introduced the new server. Then we never saw him again until we hunted him down for the check.

I rolled up in here on a Sunday afternoon because I heard about this ""bloody mary menu"" they have.  I walked in the door to see $2 mimosa's and $4 bloody mary's, awesome!  I later find out that those $4 bloody's aren't from the special menu, but the house one was still a great deal at $4.

We were seated in a section that can't be seen when you walk in, which made it somewhat difficult for our guests to find us.  Its a small section, next to the bar, with great views of tv's.  Our polite and punctual waitress greeted us quickly and we had 2 mimosa's with the quickness.  Not sure if they used prosecco or it was just pineapple juice instead of OJ, but they were rather sweet.  I liked it, especially for the price.  Knowing that we were waiting on another we decided to order an app and wait to order on the food.  Redneck Poutine?  Yep!  tator tots with cheese and a PBR mushroom gravy.  Perfect for the 1-2am crowd or the crowd struggling to get in the door for lunch the next day.

When the rest of our party arrived, my significant other ordered a bloody along with her cohorts, and I stuck with the mimosa's.  I'm pretty sure the bloody mix is made in house, although our waitress didn't know.  It was kinda chunk, pretty spicy, and just over all a solid drink.  I got the Reuben, my counterpart got the turkey on the tracks, and others got burgers.  All the food came out really quickly.  While nobody was really impressed with their burgers, they did say it wasn't bad for the money.  I ate half of each of the 2 sandwiches and was completely full.  That turkey was solid, the texas toast took it to the next level.  My Reuben was fine, nothing special, but did the trick.

I really do believe that it's good, but I felt the flavor could've been stronger. I barely could taste the rosemary in the pizza. 
Strangely enough...What I loved more than anything though was the pizza crust. It just tasted wonderful and had the right texture to it! This wonderful crust paired with the meat lover's pizza was sooo- good! So even though my own didn't wow me, because I loved the meat lovers and because I want to try all the other huge varieties of pizzas here, I will definitely return! It'd be cool if there could be a gigantic ""sampler"" pizza of all their specialty pizzas, but I guess that would be kind of hard to accomplish, now wouldn't it? One can dream...",2012-06-06 00:45:12

So on Wednesday night I decided to take her to Postino, because I went to the one on Central and loved the food (hated the service, but the food was great). So I took her to this location. Much better! The place was way less busy (i guess that's because it wasn't one of their special nights) and we were seated right away. We even found parking over by LGO. Whoa. So, anyway, We shared a bruschetta board with the brie and apple, the goat cheese and bell pepper, burrata and bacon, and prosciutto and mascarpone and we each got a glass of wine. (I got the Haart riesling.... *drool* that has got to be one of the best rieslings I have had). So the bruschetta was good, I thought the goat cheese one was not all I had hoped for, but the apple and brie was wonderful and so was the burrata and bacon... I think burrata is my new favorite cheese.... that stuff is good! Anyway, it  was a nice night and everything was fine. So fast forward to the next day. I went with my friend and her parents to the botanical gardens and then we were going to get lunch, so I list a bunch of places we can go and they decide they want to go to LGO (Now I've never been there but really want to try their pizza, it looks amazing). So we get there and realize A) there is no table service and B) there is no pizza. Lame. So my friend says.... we could go back to postino..... haha! So we ended up going again! two days in a row. 

So the second time we all got paninis and salads (and wine.... yum and 5$). I got the half and half with the turkey panini and the italian picnic salad. The turkey sandwich was pretty good, it had tomato, greens, pesto, and provolone on it. It tasted good, but nothing too special. The italian picnic salad was also just ok. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette that's supposed to be on it at all... maybe they forgot to put it on... or maybe it is ridiculously light. The other ingredients were good, it had beets, greens, goat cheese, walnuts, and some crispy things in it. My friend got the prosciutto sandwich, which I tried and it was delicious.

Pros:
Dishes are well prepared
Prices are fair

Cons:
Place is very busy during peak hours

First off, I have no idea how anybody would ever find this place.  It's located in the back corner of a plaza that really doesn't look like it would house a very good restaurant like this.  Those who do know about it seem to swear by it as the number of times I've been there I can already recognize some of the regulars.  I only know about this place because one of my co-workers is a regular here himself.

Maple Yip offers the standard set of items you would normally find at other Chinese restaurants.  They also offer banquet style set meals you can find at the larger Chinese restaurants.  You can definitely celebrate an occasion here.  Maybe not a wedding, but a retirement type celebration is great here.  I was here for a co-workers retirement dinner and it was great.  The food was well done and the service was great.  I recommend the lobster here, they make a very good one.

A typical dinner here will run about $10 a person depending on how much seafood you order and how many big eaters your party consists of.  This is well in line with other restaurants in the area.  As I said, the food here is done particularly well and you won't be disappointed.

This place is busy though.  They have a strong customer base and it's almost always packed during dinner hours.  I've never come one where there wasn't a large contingent waiting for a table. They even took over the the unit next door and opened up more tables and it still isn't enough at times.  I do believe they take reservations so that might be the best avenue to go.

Maple Yip is definitely a place you should check out.  It's not super fancy like the larger restaurants, but it gets the job done very well at a much better price.",2015-08-12 11:22:54

People have certainly mentioned this and I probably should have taken this tip more seriously, the venue this restaurant is in is very small. I'd say a maximum of 30-35 people at most could be seated in this restaurant. Luckily, my friend and I arrived fairly early during the evening at around 5PM on a Saturday. Despite the fact that they didn't have a table yet, we were seated roughly 5 minutes later. If they can't seat you right away, they'll ask for your phone number and call you when a table is available! 

According to past reviews, the price is supposed to be really good for the quality of food you get. I wouldn't say I'd necessarily disagree but I do feel as though the service could have been better. It took us quite a few tries to successfully have someone come over and take our order. I wouldn't say it was their fault as it was pretty busy in the restaurant. Several waiters and waitresses however, acknowledged that they saw us, gestured that they were coming and ended up going off somewhere else. Eventually, someone did come over and we placed our order. 

After a lot of thinking, we agreed upon ordering some sort of beef wrap that would have been really good had it not been for the egg that was inside of it. Don't get me wrong, I loved it but I did have to pick the egg out of it. I wish the menu or the waiters could have briefly explained what else was inside the wrap. I ordered the popcorn chicken bento box and my friend ordered some type of noodles in soup. She said she remembered previously liking it and I wish I could remember the name of the dish because she gave it the highest of praise. I'd say that the bento box was relatively worth the amount I paid for. I did end up taking half of it home which was easy seeing as the bento box was originally a takeout container anyways. 

I probably won't come back mostly because of how out of the way it is for me to drive all the way there. I'd recommend this if you're already in the area and looking for somewhere with quick service and cheap food though!

You know what else goes with drinking and loud music?
Young people.

Personally, I like young people. 
They just seem so much happier than old people. 
Young people are fun too, as they're often quick to experiment with alcoholic concoctions guaranteed to knock their dick in the dirt. (presuming of course there's a dick involved).

This is why I go to Sapporo.
No, not to get my dick knocked in the dirt...hell, I can do that at home.
I go there because they have a discounted happy hour menu, costing about half of what others charge for this stuff, and, yes...to watch young people get their dick knocked in the dirt.

I wish I could offer some guidance as it relates to menu items but I can't.

It seems that while the two or three take-charge type A's in our party are dutifully filling out the order form, I'm dutifully filling my gut with sake and beer.

The bar tenders were rather slow but that may have something to do with their interesting cocktail menu. We opted for plain whiskey and champagne while we waited for our table.

Everyone is so friendly and smiling, you can feel the happiness and you can tell the nail techs enjoy working there. The music is on point I was all about that 90's playlist! It's super relaxing and the lights are dimmed just enough to let them see what they're doing and let you relax while you get pampered.

4. Services- Y'all i can't speak enough about how good the services were. My polish was perfectly applied on point and my feet were the most baby soft feet in probably all of Las Vegas. I had the detox treatment done and everything form the scrub to the mud mask was heavenly. 

5. Price- Totally reasonable and affordable no matter what your budget. They start at $25 for a pedicure and have a ton of a la carte services you can add on or pick a package for a better value. The packages go all the way up to $90 I believe but trust me it's so worth it. 

6. Overall experience- 10/10 if I could rate them that many! The experience was orgasmic to say the least seriously I was so happy that we came here because they started off my birthday weekend in the best way possible! And not to mention we were sipping mimosas while getting a bomb massage and just having the best time! 

Next time I come I'm going to just get a bunch of services and stay here all day because it's amazing. Thank you guys for everything!",2017-09-24 17:33:11

I think perhaps I was spoiled by the food truck at T&T outside food mart cause they specialized in the takoyaki balls...so good there.  Anyways,  so now the combo includes this tiny bits of chicken that have been mayo-ed on top of a bowl of rice.. hardly anything there...definitely not worth the combo anymore.  The other option wasn't much better...I think pork on rice...
Second thing...the egg is included anymore...it was included if your ordered the pork...and now you have to order it as an add-on.  The pork belly didn't look as good either. My friend got that (pork & pork) and I opted for the chicken with pork stock.

o4aeKvt2wXfzfbYQRRNIKA,nHxQfB9CRettoPKJmkDx_A,l6ZrDTwUHZebCG3C9Va3Dw,3,8,0,4,"There's a small restaurant above Pamela's in Shadyside, by the name of La Feria.  Climb a small set of stairs, walk past the Latin American souvenirs, and you'll come up a small dining room with chairs. The odd placement of La Feria makes it almost unrecognizable as a full-service restaurant.
Small wooden tables were scattered throughout the eating area; there aren't many seats available at La Feria, maybe 30 in all.  Service was good the day of our visit, and we were greeted warmly as we arrived.  As we sat down, I was still a bit perplexed at the design and layout of the restaurant- the flow seemed less than cohesive, but nonetheless, was working.  I became distracted as I looked over the menu; there were customers shopping in the crafts and gallery section of the store that were secretly trying to get a glimpse of the food diners were enjoying.
The food at La Feria is described as ""a fusion of Peruvian and Latin American fare.""  Some of the offerings are, Camotes Fritos (sweet potato chips with spicy huancaina dip, $5.25), an appetizer platter that includes your choice of two empanadas with Peruvian dips served with bread and sweet potato chips for dipping ($9.95), Ropa Vieja, a shredded beef sandwich served with sweet potato chips ($7.95), Especial De Frejoles (a hot black bean salad served with garlic rice, and french bread ($9.95),  and the Combinacion, ($12.50) served with your choice of two specials, served with La Feria's garlic rice and French bread.
Our food was excellent- the chicken and beef dishes weren't over-cooked, providing plenty of flavor and moisture to the meat.  Our salads were fresh, with plenty of lettuce, veggies, and a delicious house dressing.  The French bread was soft and warm, and the rice had just enough garlic, but not so much that you needed a piece of gum afterwards.   
La Feria is a perfect lunch spot if you find yourself shopping on Walnut Street.  The food is uncomplicated, yet flavorful.  If you have to wait a few minutes for your table, browse through the store, you just might find that special gift you've been looking for.

Took my Dad and boss there over the weekend to catch up, have a burger and a milkshake, and hopefully impress my dad who is the milkshake nazi if one has ever existed.

We got an order of the Zucchini Fries to start which were actually very delicious. I was pleased with the quality of the zucchini as well as the consistency. They were not overly breaded and fried and therefore soggy, they were just right. I got their version of a Mint Chocolate Chip milkshake which was delicious but so sweet I got a stomach ache about 5 minutes into drinking it which was kind of a bummer. Our waiter overheard my Dad giving his milkshake diatribe which basically consists of ""Young people don't know how to make a milkshake anymore blah blah blah"" so poor thing bless his heart tried as hard as he could to take all of my father's demands into account on this simple chocolate shake and just failed miserably. In the business of full disclosure, he never had a chance so I cannot hold that against them.

Things took a turn for the worst when we got to the burgers. My Dad and I each ordered the Zinburger, his cooked Medium and mine cooked Medium Well. His came out Medium Well and mine Well Done. The beef wasn't terribly flavorful in my opinion. The manchego cheese and other toppings were nice, but the real issue for me lies with the buns. By the time the burgers got to our table, the buns were already so soggy that you couldn't even pick up the burger without the whole thing falling apart! Serious issue as all burger eaters out there know. We each ended up trying to knife and fork it which wasn't terribly successful either.

All in all I find Zinburger to be just average. Didn't hate it, but certainly didn't love it. I must go out of my way however to say how exemplary our service was there. Our waiter was fantastic and took excellent care of us.

We went here Friday around 7 for dinner. Things started off rough from the very beginning. A line to get a table? I can understand if it was just for the patio, but nope the whole restaurant! What's the reasoning for this? It comes off extremely pretentious--look at the line to get in our restaurant. It's 2016, most restaurants have at least a buzzer. Many even text you! It's dumb too because I usually buy a beer while I wait for a table, but you can't do that here. Luckily it was a fairly short wait.

This is an issue in many restaurants, but wow it is noisy inside! To make matters worse we were seated by the beer sign, which started flipping and wouldn't stop. It finally stopped, but flipped again later. Very annoying.

Service was mostly slow, waitress hardly checked on us. Our food did come out quickly though. We had the Local burger, calamari, and wings. Wings were small, but good. The calamari was delicious.

This is the place to go for a reasonably priced belgian waffle ($3.50 for a waffle, extra for add-ons - which is where it can get expensive). The waffles are cooked fresh to order. The chocolate dipped waffle is a must for me, the chocolate fudge sauce is incredible (and I am considered a chocolate snob by my friends). The mixed fruit or strawberry add on is usually good value, I've always received about a punnet of berries on the side (for about $3.50).

I had stopped going there for a while, after several times where the same server was never able to get the order right, and I was always charged a different price for exactly the same order. On my most recent visit the servers had changed, and the service had improved a lot. It's still a very casual place, the guy behind the counter called to us to confirm our order several minutes after we had paid and seen the check-out girl write the order down.

My main peeve is that when eating in, food is still served in plastic containers. Crepes appeared to be served on paper plates, and I don't see a reason why waffles can't be served this way too, in the very least.

I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entr√©e. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays. 

My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. 

I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.

Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon. 

I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion pur√©e and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more. 

For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.

Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with cr√®me anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious.

I knew my Mom would not like ""Anime Ramen"" because it's too loud in there. I wanted to originally take her to ""Yagyu Yakiniku"" because they have a very spicy broth that I know she likes, but to our surprise they were closed when we got there. And, we didn't like the new ""Ramen Sora"" when we went there a month ago... So we had no choice but to try Monta. 

We usually don't like to go to Monta because of the long wait time to get a seat, but to our surprise there was no line and we were sat immediately. I've come to the conclusion that if you go before 5:00, there is usually no wait time. 

The thing I like the best about Monta is that you always get good service here. If I rank the service from 1 to 10(with 1 being the lowest),  I have never experienced anything less than a 20!

This time, I tried the Shoyu Ramen. It was excellent. I think they have the best Shoyu Ramen in the world. No other restaurant compares. 

Everyone knows from my previous reviews that my favorite Ramen in the world is Miso Ramen. The thing about Miso Ramen is that no region has a similar recipe. And Ramen houses that are located in the same area will always try to copy each others style. In San Diego, the popular Ramen houses pack their Miso broth with boiled cabbage and give you nothing but noodles and broth. That means you get no egg, charsiu, bamboo, or fungus like you do anywhere else. In Los Angeles, the Miso Ramen is typically pure white in color, and extremely spicy. At the Restaurants which are run by ethnically Chinese people who are Japanese in nationality, the broth is very smooth, thin, and full of sesame oil. Now, Las Vegas is the only region that doesn't have a typical style of  Miso Ramen. Monta's Miso Ramen has a broth that is pure yellow, smooth in texture, not spicy, and the taste of the actual miso beans is extremely strong. Anime Ramen has a Miso that is almost identical to what you get at the ethnically Chinese-Japanese Ramen houses.  And Yagyu has a spicy white-broth Ramen that is very oily, and heavy in meats.  So, if you like a non-spicy traditional Japanese taste then Monta is for you. If you like a spicy traditional Japanese Ramen that has way more meat than noodles, then Yagyu is for you. If you like a thin broth full of sesame with all the sides included, then Anime Ramen is for you. That's what I like about the LV Ramen scene: diversity! 

In the end, after trying Monta again after many months, I have come to the conclusion that Monta is still the undisputed champion of Las Vegas Ramen.",2012-03-10 09:30:15

This place is not for: sushi eaters or anyone who lives farther away.

Taro's Fish is a sushi fish market, first and foremost, with fridges full of different sushi fish in whole form, from various origins, in exceptional quality.  You can pick the fish from the fridge, and they will prepare it for you as sashimi.  They also have a good selection of rolls and sushi they can prepare.  The quality of the sushi is great for the value.  It's not comparable to the highest end sushi shops as some have waxed lyrical about, but it beats most other sushi places and definitely at its price point.

There are some nice touches like how they include a bag of ice to keep your sushi cool for transport.

There are issues though:
- if ordering sushi or rolls, preparation can take a long time, despite what looks to be 8 people working in the back, and no customers in the front
- they use an old, simple point-of-sale cash machine, so your receipt does not show you what you ordered and there is no tracking of what you ordered, thus leading to many mistakes and mixup.  I've left the shop with items missing from my bag.

In the end, I can't recommend this place unless you live nearby.  This is not a destination joint.  While the sushi is good quality, I think you can find at least one sushi shop near wherever you live in Toronto, with similar quality, and messing up my order multiple times - which could be solved with a better POS or just a paper checklist system - is unforgiveable.

If you do order from Taro Fish, keep this in mind:
- give yourself plenty of time, or order ahead for large orders
- double check your order before you leave",2018-09-07 20:08:20

And I've had their Rice platter with grilled pork (Thit Nuong) and egg rolls. I thought the meat was awesome. It had a good flavor and the egg rolls were pretty good too. My one complaint is that the rice wasn't your typical ""broken rice"" where the rice pieces are smaller. They served whole rice grains, which is fine but I was really looking foward to the traditional Com Tam.

My fiance has gotten their Bun Thit Nuong (Dry noodle bowl with grilled pork) and he didn't have any complaints. The fish sauce (Nuoc Mam) was decent, nothing too spectacular. 

And the service isn't too bad either. I've gone when they've been pretty busy and I thought the service was moderately attentive.

So I'd been passing this place by like every single day for over a year and I pitching their neighborhood mailers every week. Then I saw them advertising vegan options and I decided to give them a try.¬† I am so glad that I did!

Appetizer:¬†
I got the vegan chicken strips served ""Super Hot Chipotle"" style. They are baked, not fried, and they use the Beyond Meat brand. They were very tasty & perfectly spiced, but not spicy. I expected it to be very spicy, given the name, but it wasn't. At all. But to be fair, I do have a high spice level tolerance. The strips came with vegan ranch, celery, & an apple piece. 

The vegan strips come in NINE different flavors, which I think is amazing! I will definitely go back to try more flavors.  It cost over $11 for this appetizer, which is almost the cost of a full pasta entree; a bit too high in my opinion, especially for the portion size.¬†(So you're paying more than $1 per strip.)  They have a happy hour from 3p-6p and the appetizers are 1/2 off, which is about what the price should be anyway - 1/2 of what is now.  From now on, I'll only order appetizers if I'm there during HH.  

Entree:
I opted for the vegan Chicken Picatta pasta dish. The pasta was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The garlic, lemon, and capers offered a nice burst of flavor for my tastebuds, and the presence of the Beyond Meat Chicken was plentiful in this dish. It came with a slice of vegan garlic bread. Very filling and delicious. @ $14 for this dish, which is reasonable. 

I wanted something ""green"" with my meal (but not a salad), so I ordered a side of Tender Broccoli Crowns. For $6.50, I got @ 6 pieces of organic broccoli. Nicely seasoned & crunchy crowns, but nothing special. I can make better at home, for less $... and I can't cook. ¬†

The waitress (who was actually the bartender b/c I sat in the bar area) was a bit aloof and she brought my check without first asking if I wanted anything else, like dessert. I didn't like that.¬†I like dessert. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated & clean. It has a really large and inviting patio area in the back and it extends around to the side of the building.  There were misters going, but I also saw heat lamps, which are nice for cool days.  The bar area had 2 TVs going, both showing sports. I do not drink, so I'm unable to speak on the alcohol situation, aside from saying that there is one. ¬†

I spoke with the head chef on duty and she advised me that they use separate utensils and even separate ovens for their vegan foods.¬†

Tons of vegan pasta & pizza options (the website boasts that they have over 40 vegan options), lots of organic foods, 98% gluten free, & they support local businesses. I'd definitely recommend them for vegans (and regular people...not saying that vegans are irregular) for anything from family outings to business lunches or date night.¬†

Onto the garlic knots, best I've had, so soft and chewy and the perfect amount of seasoning. We decided to try the cheese pizza and add pineapple and jalepenos and a white pizza with sausage/garlic/tomatoes. Both were perfect. The crust was out of this world crazy good, flaky and just enough crunch. I'm not a huge sausage fan, but it tasted like it was made in house. Fantastic. 

We had a huge amount of leftovers I took home, I re-heated it for dinner, and to my surprise, it was just a delicious the second time around (reheated in the oven of course, not the microwave) the crust still had a good crunch to it.

There's a few counters with preboxed items, and there's a fresh counter where you can pick out which candies you'd like. The apricot delight is very interesting and very sweet. It's a nice change of pace from the typical fruit candies. Milk chocolate strawberry cream was better than I thought it would be - perfectly balanced sweetness with the chocolate. Peanut butter pattie was nothing to write home about - I might skip it in the future. Same goes for the milk chocolate coconut.

The Good - Excellent draft beer selection. Waitress (Brooke) was really on the ball and brought out 4 IPA samples to make a choice. No complaints there! One of two fish tacos was very good (see the Bad for the other)... that was the shrimp taco. The shrimp was tender and lightly breaded, with cole slaw and a spicy sauce that really worked. Irresistible.   

The Bad - On the other hand, the blackened Mahi fish taco was bland and dry. Needs some work, didn't come with the variety of flavors described in the menu.

The Weird - Strange for a bar to have a food menu but not a beer list. That would have been helpful in ordering, although as mentioned above the waitress made it work.

I ended up chatting with another customer who was having the same difficulty as I was. Wheres the XL's?  Its all geared towards smaller sized individuals.  This is upsetting.

Im upset about that, along side the fact that the parking lot here is a complete and udder disaster.  gravel, construction cones, dead end parking isles, and the so forth.

He was quick to say I need to tell that to the Manager. Didn't offer a number to call or I guess doesn't have the authority to run my car back thru for the wash I paid for?

Husband's Bathtub Gin was tasty, refreshing and cool. I loved my Lonestar Mule in a chilled copper mug (I had a mule in a glass the other day at an unnamed bar and would not recommend it). As much as he wanted to get an appetizer, I was starved and just wanted real food. Sorry, bacon board. 

I had our sweet server decide for me between the St. Louis Ribs and the Short Ribs. She highly recommended the short ribs, so Husband got the St. Louis Ribs (next time we've got to try their burger though). Not long later, our meals came out. Mine with a side of grilled cauliflower steak and his with a side of mac and cheese, both with cole slaw. Yum! I took a bite of my short ribs and... was a bit disappointed. My dad made incredible short ribs, very moist and full of flavor. And, while these were very flavorful, they were a bit dry. Our server came by to check on us and I let her know I wasn't thrilled. She didn't whisk my food away like most servers, she gave me a quick solution, which I fully loved: BBQ sauce. Yes please! So she ran off to get three different flavors and, upon her return, the manager, Jacob, was right in front of her. He asked me about my short ribs and apologized that they weren't up to par and insisted he bring out a new one. 

Jacob let me keep my cauliflower topped with cheese and the most amazing whiskey onions (Husband is obsessed with those whiskey onions) and took my dish. In the meantime, I tried Husband's St. Louis Ribs. SO GOOD! I love the BBQ sauce and the ribs don't fall off the bone and I'm not mad about it. Incredibly tasty. 

Jacob came back out and apologized. He found that all the short ribs were a little dry, so he 86'd them from the menu. We were impressed he cared enough to check, then pull, a less than stellar item off the menu off of one customer's minor complaint. He very kindly offered to bring out anything else from the menu and suggested the Beef Brisket. Okay, I'll have that! Best.Decision.Ever. It melted in my mouth. I was sad when I was full and couldn't eat any more. I did bring the leftovers to my mom and she immediately began making plans to bring her friend to Bootleggers! 

TL;DR. Great specialty drinks on daily happy hour. Problem with meal was successfully resolved by Jacob, the manager. To die for brisket meal and cauliflower side. 

Eat here, you won't regret it.",2014-06-19 00:01:06

I looked around.  I picked up a hotdog wrapped in a bun and some cream cheese bites.  The woman didn't speak/understand much English.  I pointed to something on a tray and she pointed to something else that didn't even look like what I pointed to.

They are a CASH ONLY store.

The hotdog was really good.  It was child-sized, not enough to make a meal.  The bun was chewy and soft.

The cream cheese bites came in a clear plastic box of 4 bite-sized pastries.  The cream cheese was sweet and creamy.  The outside was soft and flaky.  They melted in my mouth.  I didn't realize I ate all 4 of them standing in the kitchen.

IKEA can wait but Cracker Barrel couldn't, so I stopped by for an early dinner today only to see an expected line of people outside awaiting their turn while rocking in wooden rocking chairs under misting fans and hanging/shading burlap - although the entrance faces east.

I knew I didn't desire to wait two hours to be seated, so I searched on their website for online ordering or perhaps telephone ordering.  The wait for an online order was two hours as well; but, fortunately, I called and the wait for a telephone order was only 30 MINUTES!!  So, pre-order by calling ahead, but be sure to eat it right away - we wouldn't want all that yummy country goodness to get cold.

Sat at the grill and it was already a pretty busy night for them. This place gave that family restaurant feeling rather than hip ambiance, which they didn't seem to appear like they aimed to be one or the other. Even though I sat at the teppanyaki grill I just wanted appetizers. The waiter was very attentive and I got everything I've asked for. I had to ask for soy sauce which was kind of different. 

Free soup came (didn't look or taste like miso, they didn't say it was anyways, regardless it tasted good)... had to try their calamari strips and it was alright. Also tried their nigiri and that too was alright. Same with their baked green mussels. I'm glad there's nothing about the taste of the food I ordered I disliked. It was satisfying. 

I did look into yelp reviews prior going and noticed the same women's bathroom stall lock is still the same makeshift bent metal lock and the bathroom was just dirty... like a public park restroom during an event but before it gets too filthy later on at night when the drunks come out to play. How long will that broken stall lock take to repair in the bathroom?! The service and food are great! Super friendly & I'll have to admit, I'm surprised they didn't keep us off the teppanyaki table as we chatted for a good while after and the rest of the table left.

Dicks out everyone.  

I've had many an argument as to the godliness of each and though I tend to stand in the In n Out camp when discussing this with my Texas friends, and contrastively with my West Coast friends, i stand firmly that each has its place near the high end of the hamburger spectrum. 

Visiting In n Out  for the first time is like being a drunken male in some unfamiliar La Quinta bathroom in Reseda, California.  There seem to be limited options.  

But once you get the feel of it, you realize that you can sit down to pee if you want.  You can use the towel rack to brace yourself.  You can pee in the bathtub or bypass all ration and lay in the damn tub like a newborn ... all kinds of stuff you would never do at your regular place.

Treat this place like that budget hotel.  This is not your regular place, this In n Out Burger.  Be creative.  Get nasty.  Try that 3x3 Animal Style with Animal Style fries.  Grilled onions?

I'd have given it one star but thought that might not be entirely fair. I recently attended a conference at the hotel (great) and stayed there for 3 nights (the not so great).

Hotel Stay:  I arrived around 8 or so in the evening to check in. I was impressed by the decor of the lobby. However there was an awkward line to check in and there were a few people ahead of me with only one person working the front desk. I got in line and waited about 10 minutes, at which point another person came to help guests check in. He made eye contact with me (next in line), said ""can I help you"" and as I took steps towards him, another man behind me physically pushed me out of the way and told the clerk he needed his keys reset. The clerk did not reference I was next nor did he apologize for making me continue to wait while he helped the other guest. I realize the guest rudeness was not his fault but he could have acknowledge the inconvenience with a simple ""sorry about that"". Instead he was aloof at best.

A couple of hours later I was winding down in my room. I wanted to relax in a bath but it was full of all kinds of black bits and the drain had to be pried open as the lever wasn't working. After I attempted to deal with that, I happened to notice a red thumb or fingerprint smear on the external bathroom doorknob. Looked like blood. Gross. However I did not want to attempt to switch rooms while in my pyjamas so I instead let the manager know via email, picture included.  The next morning I received a prompt apologetic email from the manager and he said they would investigate it as ""cleanliness was a top priority"". Shortly thereafter I got an email from housekeeping, declaring the smudge was ""rust"" and that all had been removed. I am not stupid-there wasn't a bit of rust in the place and I found their explanation to be dismissive and insulting. Either way, if the guest feels like there is blood in the room, it's still unsettling. Right?  When I politely expressed that I was unhappy with their explanation, they offered me a choice of one free breakfast or a ""free"" late check out time. To add to that, in ""daylight"" I could see that the room while relatively clean, was not well maintained with carpet stains, paint on the drapes and floors and little items of garbage under the bed etc. Not exactly high end hotel caliber. 

I will give them points however for their conference facilities on the 12th floor. The room was beautiful and interesting and the food provided both at breaks and at lunch was well plated and prepared, delicious and served by friendly staff. 

I would recommend it as a conference venue but if you are thinking about staying there, pick something else...there are far better options down-town where you don't have to worry about what fluids are on the doorhandles or clean out your own bathtub.",2012-05-07 16:42:28

This place is right by where I get my hair done. I was early for my recent appointment and decided to grab a quick breakfast while I waited.

I decided to try their berry mimosa and surprisingly, this was one of the best mimosas I've EVER had (that is saying a lot)....they give you the split of champagne and there was plenty of juice/berries and it had really good flavor (considering it was cheap champagne).

It was just before St. Paddy's Day and the corned beef bennie had my name written all over it! The corned beef itself was good, but this wasn't really a ""bennie.""

Not only was the entire staff Japanese when I came... all the customers were too!  That has to be a good sign!

Pros:  
* Not over-crowded like some restaurants in C - town area (Ichiza-Ahem)
* Decently priced
* Portions were generous
* $1.00 items !  wowza!
* inviting atmosphere
* Spacious seating (no one is in your personal bubble)

Cons:
*  Extra menu items were on the wall in Japanese! Specials??  Help?
*  Slow service
* No WiFi.. Boo!!!

Ordered:
Curry Ramen -  This was seriously amazing!  I'm craving it now !
Chicken Gizzard - came on a skewer.. only a $1.00  

Verdict:
 Considering there are only a handful of places that serve Curry Ramen in Vegas (at least to my knowledge), this was definitely one of the best.  I had no complaints.  The curry wasn't too overpowering, the portions were huge, and the pieces of beef in the soup was extremely tender.  I love it!  I'd definitely come here again.  Why not a 5-star?  Well, the service was a bit on the slow side, but aside from that... everything else was an ace! (No they do not have ayce and yes they do have sushi if you were wondering).

Tips:
*  Try the Ramen Soup  ( I hear they all their soups are really good)
*  Look out for those dollar deals on the menu.  I promise they are there.
*  Ask about the specials on the wall... then let me know what its about.

I had a salad, which was fresh, and a personal pizza, which was crisp & tasty.  I thought the prices were a bit on the high end given the type of place this is, but the service & fresh food made up for it..

Tasted the chicken parmigiana, which was good, but  not fantastic - I would venture to guess that most of the menu is about like that - You are probably pretty ""safe' in ordering just about everything.....

It is a busy place with moderate noise level & kids - Not a place for that ""romantic"" date you've been planning for ages.....

Swapping bread out with Tiabi's waffles didn't really change the overall taste of my breakfast sandwich, which contained eggs, sausage, and cheese. Their waffles aren't very flavorsome alone. I doused my order with srircha. 

Despite my table's seemingly simple wafflewich orders, we were left waiting for our food for an unreasonably long time period. There were only two people working in the shop, sharing the responsibilities of taking orders, preparing and carrying out the food, and attending to guests. Needless to say, the service was definitely lacking. One of the owners actually asked my friend and I to wait before ordering, but she completely left us hanging. There was a moderate amount of people in the shop, but it wasn't terribly busy.

There are lots of cool bars and restaurants in Downtown if you know where to look. The D is super convenient for music festivals like EDC and Life is Beautiful and that's two reason why I've stayed here.

If you need a break from all the glitz and glamour of the Vegas strip, this is the place for you. The hotel is old, but has been remodeled. I tend to think older hotels will reek of smoke, but I actually don't notice that at all here.  The rooms are clean and spacious. The bed is super comfortable. I love that their bathroom has a huge counter and mirrors. Very convenient, ladies!

Two things I have to gripe about: Horrendous air conditioning, and the terribly slow elevators. Most recent stay here, the AC, even on full blast, barely made the room cool. This made our stay pretty much unbearable. I hope you brought your patience, because the elevators take forever. We were up at the 25th floor this past trip. The elevator would take forever to come and when it did, it was full. We (along with a lot of other people) ended up taking the stairs down...all 25 floors. Bright side: At least it wasn't 25 floors going up! Granted, this is during EDC weekend.

Anyway, stay at your own risk. Overall, it's a decent hotel, convenient location, reasonable rates during various festivals.",2016-06-28 18:00:36

It was like Denny's on crack.

I had the french toast collage which said came with three eggs, two strips of bacon and two sausages. The eggs looked like the whole dozen! It was fun to grind fresh pepper into 'em. I loved the sausage and the bacon was fine. The french toast is made with thick Texas toast. Not too eggy and served with whipped butter and syrup. I could not finish all that food.

My friends had the bbq chicken wrap and feta cheese omelette. They both enjoyed their food and felt happy with their choices despite the kitchen messing up the omelette. She wanted egg whites and the order had to be redone. 

Service is a little slow (but friendly- the waitress was very fascinated with my henna tattoo) but it is a really crowded place. We had to repeatedly ask for the cocktail waitress but it was worth it. I throughly enjoyed my giant bloody mary. The mimosa and kir royale were also loved.

I am Latina, so hence look Latina, but I don't speak Espanol. I know I know, blame my mom for not letting my dad teach me! Anywhooo, this always happens, they started speaking to me in Spanish, I try to follow as best I can, but I just wasn't getting it, so at the observation of the confused look on my face the gal asked me if I speak Spanish, I shook my head no and instead of following in the manner of many other not so nice responses I've gotten, she said OK and proceeded to describe what I was asking about in English, even a gentleman behind her sort of helped out. I thought that was very nice as often people will make a mockery of me or make me feel weird for not speaking Spanish, but they surely didn't...

Sooo once I placed my order for the Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas (to-go) I was greeted by a friendly Senor who mumbled something to me in Spanish, I once again said, no habla Espanol and only then did I realize that English was clearly NOT his first language. He was SO NICE and instead of walking away and not even bothering, he started speaking to me in English, he took his time to gather the words and slowly get out what he was trying to say. I was definitely listening. He offered me a free bottle of water while I waited, he thanked me for coming, he told me that he was happy I am there, etc. I was so baffled at this guy! He GENUINELY cares about his restaurant AND the people that go there. He also offered me a Margarita, but since I was on my lunch break (darn! haha) I settled for a Sangria Senorial (don't worry, it's non-alcoholic, sort of like grape juice or something). Normally I don't like taking hand outs, honestly, it makes me feel awkward, but I could tell that me accepting his offer genuinely made him happy.

So NOT ONLY were the people a dream the food was SOOO GOOD! Ahhhh. BOMB ceviche, probably the best I've ever had north of the border. Straight up! I like how it was packaged, the portion was generous and the price was definitely reasonable. It only ran about $8 bucks for two of them! I NEVER and I mean NEVER tip on to-go orders, but this time I was so impressed, I absolutely did!

GO CHECK THEM OUT! DO IT! NOWWW! LOL.

So I have a long history of having Johnny's place being my go to place. I cannot tell you how many people I took to Sens. I literally believe it was in the 100s. I tried to start every night there when I was living downtown and most nights ended there. 

Then I moved to Midtown and had a regular bird and we would do date night there but it just wasn't the same in terms of frequency. 

Then came ASU and downtown changed and they fucked up his street and he'd had his eye on the new spot that is now Sochu House for a while and the stars aligned and he moved. And I moved back downtown literally a mile from Sochu House. 

Dallas G - The Hot and Dirty Life, Redux, or so I thought. I was so hopeful. 

And so I started going there at least once a weekend and it felt like old times with some of the old bartenders and the ever clever and interesting Johnny... 

But, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, people started being honest with me. The problem is that I'm a vegan and I don't eat anything that comes from an animal. Like, if I know an animal molecule is in my food, I won't eat it. 

And I found out there's fish sauce in the Papaya salad, which was one of my favorite things on Earth. And there's fish sauce in some of the sauces. So what used to be my favorite place on Earth became a source of stress and distrust. 

So I had to stop eating there. But I still go for the drinks. Just not like I used to...

It is a clean place that is fairly 'nice', enjoyable to go in and sit down for a meal.  I see a lot of comments about old people which is kind of stupid. Old people like nice, quaint places to eat and appreciate good value for their money so yeah, I'm sure they come here. You should probably follow them everywhere as they have good taste.

We were one of 2 tables there which should have been a sign.  We got there around 5:40 and asked about Happy Hour.  We were told happy hour runs until 6 PM and was already over.  After showing our waitress it was indeed 5:40 PM, we finally got menus.

I have always liked Sushi Eye because of their imaginative rolls and beautiful prep that goes into their rolls but things have changed.  We ordered the Orange Blossom roll which in the pictures shows the salmon wrapped around the sushi to look like a flower petal.  Our roll had a small piece of salmon placed on top was not the quantity of fish pictured on the menu.  I ordered miso soup, which was very good, but my White Tuna Sashimi smells fishy and not in a good way.  The Happy hour drink deal was nice though, we had 2 Sake Bombers with big beers and a small carafe of sake for $6 apiece.

We tried to use our Groupon at the end of the meal but our server refused it saying it was ""fraudulent"".  She explained 3rd party had created it and it had nothing to do with their restaurant, even though their address and menu was attached to it.  She told me to contact Groupon because ""Groupon is already aware of the matter and the restaurant had alerted them to the fraudulent deal.""  We paid full price and the next day I contacted Groupon about a refund.  Groupon had no idea what I was talking about and said they have never been contacted by Sushi Eye about the matter.  The kicker?  The ""Fraudulent"" Groupon was still up on their site and available for purchase.

My boyfriend and I stopped in to pick up a membership, but my bf works near the downtown phoenix location, which has been designated platinum. Our plan was to pick up one of the platinum + memberships so that we could both use the membership because of the guest privileges. 

They were pretty straightforward with us, and told us that the Gold plus membership (which was a dollar cheaper) would only have the guest privileges work at their club. But platinum plus had guest privileges at every club. 

I appreciate that they put honesty as their first priority rather than just doing whatever was necessary to make the sale. We got our membership through the downtown location but, because this is the closest to our house, will be looking forward to working out here as well!

As for the menu, everything is a wee blank.  THe most flavorful item on the menu is the mole sauce.  The mole sauce doesn't really taste like mole, though, but it's richly flavored.

The inside of Saddle Mountain Brewery is somewhat large with bars on both sides of the restaurant and some booths and tables in the middle.  Behind the back bar you can also see the brewing equipment (fermenters) so can tell that the beer is brewed here.  It is decorated to look industrial so you can she the air ducts, there's so pipes separating a bar and dining room and the light covers looked industrial as well.  Last but not least they have a little merchandise area where you can buy apparel, pint glasses, etc.

As I often do whenever I visit a new brewery I went ahead and ordered a flight of beer.  At Saddle Mountain a flight consists of 6 beers and I chose the IFR Nitro (oatmeal stout), Rays Gold (IPA), Hop Snob (west coast IPA), 300 Foot Steve (imperial red), clandestine (Scottish Ale) and Hops and Oats (OPA).  All of the beers here ended up being good representations of their types with my favorites being the west coast IPA and the OPA.  As an appetizer our group ordered the nachos.  While we were waiting for them the waitress came back and told us that they were out of the pork chili verde and asked if we would like chicken breast instead.  Since we didn't have much of an option we agreed.  As soon as they put it down it looked great.  The chips were clearly freshly made and not of your standard variety.  All of the toppings worked well with the nachos too and I especially loved all of the jalepenos they put on it.  I think that they did this to compensate for the fact that the chicken wasn't in a chili verde sauce and so this may not be standard.  Then for my entree I went with the fire burger.  It consisted of a burger, fire roasted poblano chile, spicy chile pepper blend, poblano cream cheese, pepper jack cheese, fried onion straws, onion and lettuce all on a brioche.  As you can imagine it definitely had a bit of a kick to it!  It wasn't overly spicy though and the brioche bun was a good pick as it held together throughout my eating of it.  The burger was cooked nicely and my favorite part was probably the fried onion straws which gave the burger a lot of flavor and a little bit of a crunch too.

In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.

I started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot.

I ordered the Three Mile Island sauce because I love me some spicy chicken!  Unfortunately, they're *always* pretty stingy with their sauce (that's why I have to take away one of their stars).   I can tell because the chicken pieces are barely dipped in the sauce with a lot of obviously bare, uncoated spaces.  C'mon, now.  If you're going to dip them, really dip them!  I'm afraid to ask for more when the server brings them because a lot of places will charge you $1 extra for a side of sauce!

I worked at a busy restaurant in the past, so I know how hectic it can get at the beginning of March Break. 
My boyfriend and I were seated at our table and we waited for 15 minutes before a server walked up to us and ask, ""What you want to drink?""   No hello, how are you, no smile. We asked for water. She leaves, comes back with two waters then walks away. Didn't even ask us if we were ready to order or not.
Another 10-15 minutes pass by and she comes back again. ""You ready?"" We ordered the 1/4 ribs and wings, both with different BBQ sauce flavors. 

When our food arrives, she just plops it on the table (at the edge) and walks away. Doesn't even tell us which plate has what BBQ sauce.

The food was good though, cornbread was surprisingly good too. I was expecting chewy, rubbery cornbread.

Ik6gvxB6MhCo_tir3JrX4A,1TVhmXcDVqFTtyJNKEFVxw,u8C8pRvaHXg3PgDrsUHJHQ,1,1,3,0,"We stopped by Papa Del's to order pizza, but ended up opting for pasta instead since we didn't have the 40-60 minutes needed for it to bake. Pizza by the slice is not available after 3 (and we were there a little after on a Saturday). We were okay with that, but did not end up having a good visit.

First, the service. We had not been to the new location. There were lots of employees behind the carryout counter and a couple servers in the restaurant space. We decided it must be a ""seat yourself"" situation, so we sat down. When we'd sat for some time while servers walked around us without greeting us or taking our order, I got up and asked someone in the front area if we needed to notify someone that we'd taken a table. The young man at the entrance stand said yes, he was supposed to seat us. Now, my husband had seen him earlier in the restaurant area near our table. He was sitting in a chair pulled up to a booth with customers in it, chatting away -- he had been there and not up front when we walked in. From his chair in the restaurant area, he had watched us come in and seat ourselves. But when I asked him whether we could remain there, he said, no, there were no servers assigned to that table. He asked us to move to another room in the restaurant, which we did.

Second, the food. We had an okay server (disorganized but well-intentioned) at our table for three, so things were looking up. We ordered mozzarella sticks, 2 salads (Italian for an up-charge and American) and fries as our sides, and 3 orders of pasta with meat sauce and meatballs with garlic bread (for an up-charge). 

The mozzarella sticks are probably from a frozen bag of sticks, but they tasted good enough (by the time we got them, they'd cooled too much -- they weren't gooey any longer, unfortunately). The marinara with them was tasty. The salads and their dressings were fresh and delicious. They were generous in size, too.

The garlic bread was decent (although soggy because of the pasta water -- see below). The bread was fairly low quality, but it was crisped and the garlic butter on it was plentiful and tasty. The fries (our third side dish) never arrived. 

The Pasta -- Not Recommended

The pasta was bad. Very bad. As the server carried plates of pasta toward us, there was so much water on the plates that it was slopping onto the floor. Some of it went down her front. She was apologizing and trying to level the plates so they wouldn't slop reddish water onto the table. She thought the water was coming from the meat sauce. It wasn't. It was clear to any good home cook that the pasta (the spaghetti and mostaccioli) had not been drained nearly enough. 

The garlic bread (which, again, we'd paid extra for) was sitting in a pool of water on each plate, soaking it up. I immediately saved my bread by taking it off the plate and began soaking up the water with a napkin. It took two big napkins to soak most of the pasta water up on my plate alone. 

We'd asked for the noodles to be cooked el dente. They were almost all the way soft -- not chewy at all. If the pasta had been cooked even a minute longer, I wouldn't have been able to eat it (soft pasta really grosses me out). The pasta was your regular dried pasta, and not of a high quality semolina, either. It's your garden-variety grocery store pasta (think Creamette).

The pasta sauce was not sticking to the noodles, leading us to believe that the pasta had probably been rinsed so that no starch coating remained to cling to the sauce. Of course, the extra water still on the pasta might have also caused this. The pasta had no flavor; we also don't believe the water in which it was cooked had been salted. 

There was also too little sauce for the amount of pasta. And, it was not a slow-cooked meat sauce, but a marinara sauce with meat added to it. When I see ""meat sauce"" on an Italian-American menu, I expect red gravy with meat, long simmered, not some kind of cobbled together crushed tomato from a can with meat sauteed and added.

The three meatballs were of decent size and might have been house-made. We weren't sure, because they had so much filler in them (the ratio of meat to breadcrumb was low). My homemade meatballs are much better. My husband did not finish two of his meatballs, because he also did not like the taste (more dried herb than meat, with a bit of bitter garlic in the mix). We brought them home for our puppies. 

A manager came to apologize after our meal (I'd asked the server to speak with him but to wait until we finished eating). He said he had had a talk with the line cooks (and I agree the worst problems were due to poor technique and lack of care / quality control in the kitchen). However, he did not offer to reduce our bill or provide a dessert or other compensation for the experience.

The best part of our experience was the air conditioning. It was a hot day and the space was pleasantly cool.",2017-08-13 01:49:55

I prefer mine really crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 

They also have a drink called orange yuzu which is basically a knock off of the one I recently had at Pearl's Finest Teas in Los Angeles. The one at Pearl's was much better, and they actually had bits of yuzu in it. I think they only use yuzu syrup here.

According to Google wait time was only supposed to be less than 15 minutes.  So NEVER trust Google for wait time estimates.  But to speed things up, they hand you the menu while you are in line so you can order right away when you are seated.  From ordering to getting the food, it was SUPER fast.  The hubby took off his jacket, and went to the washroom, and our ramen arrived at the table before he even came back! We ordered their signature clam broth shio ramen, original shoyu tonkotsu ramen, and a side of braised pork belly.  Starting off with the broths.  Both the clam broth, and the tonkotsu broths are VERY different from any of the other ramen houses in Toronto.  The clam broth, very light and clear, strong truffle and clam flavours.  Nothing like I've ever tasted in a ramen broth before.  Delicious.  The tonkotsu broth, exact opposite of the clam broth, beautiful creamy pork broth that coats your mouth and doesn't seem to go away.  While being creamy, it didn't feel heavy.  I know it's a sign of respect and that you enjoyed your meal by finishing your broth.  Usually I don't.  But this time, I drank it all down!

Noodles, also different than the ramen houses in Toronto.  The only other time I've had ramen noodles like this was in North America was in New York City at Mr. Taka Ramen (sister restaurant to Bigiya in Tokyo which is also on Michelin's Bib Gourmand list).  The noodles are thinner, more al dente, and I would say more similar to a pasta than the ramen noodles that i'm used to eating.

All of their meats are done sous vide.  While the meat was tender, it felt a bit dry.  I assume because the chashu was made with a leaner cut of pork.  There was a thin strip of fat, but other than that, the chashu was very lean.  The pork belly, had some strips of fat running through it, and it was definitely a bit more juicy than the chashu, but there was a bit of gristle so some bites were a bit chewier.  I guess I'm just not a fan of the sous vide method.  The braised pork belly also came with an egg.  Presentation of the egg was flat out horrible looking.  I can't figure out how they cut it to look the way it did.  And it was also missing chunks of white too.  Usually when you can't peel the shell away from a boiled egg properly, either they did it too hot, or the egg wasn't fresh.",2018-01-25 22:04:42

Our favourites were the lobster bisque (not too creamy or salty), cold crab legs (a bit salty but still good), and grilled pork belly (need I say any more?)...and the chocolate fountain. The fresh donuts were good, too.

We've heard pretty good things about the seafood bar in particular, which was impressive, and it was the reason we chose Spoonful over Wok of Fame. On a Wednesday night, only shrimps, crab legs, mussels, octopus, and whelks were available. Unfortunately, the mussels were mushy and tasteless, the octopus was rubbery and also tasteless, and the whelks had a VERY unpleasant smell to them! I noticed the smell the moment I picked one up. I was very surprised that they were still being served despite the awful fishy smell. The next time I walked by the seafood bar, they were all gone. (Someone must have complained about them before I got the chance to.)

Even worse, I woke up the next morning at 5 due to a stomachache and nausea. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the mussels or the octopus because neither had any taste, which made me think they were not very fresh.",2014-10-02 04:03:53

Their smoothies are delicious and I usually come in the morning on the way to work since I work in a business office above the shopping center. I've seen the same woman the multiple times I've come to get a drink and she's really friendly. I'm always able to adjust certain things in my smoothie without it being an issue. I love that their 1 size is big and decently price ($5 average) and especially since they have happy hour going on right now that's half-off during certain hours. The smoothies are have a nice creamy texture and not too sweet. The only thing I didn't like was their salad because the lettuce was a little wilted and the dressing was too thick but the smoothies are the focal point so my review remains at 5 stars!,2016-01-19 23:31:35

Very, very nice people here, they seemed to be friendly to everyone.

Full disclosure: The only reason why I came here was cause of the Scene card promotion, where if you visit participating restaurants you'll get 50x the Scene points if you end up spending at least a certain amount. Therefore you can kind of guess my expectations weren't too high on Montana's.

That being said, I had an awesome server during my time in this place, and honestly if it weren't for her my stay would've been forgetful.

I wasn't hungry that night, so I opted for the fire grilled top sirloin, in addition to a skillet of sizzling mushrooms. I asked for medium rare, and to my surprise...I got medium rare! I always tend to have steaks that are more cooked than what I requested, so honestly I expected a medium steak. Either way, the steak was just okay. In fact, when it came to my table the steak was not hot at all, barely lukewarm if that. The mushrooms, however, were very good so that kind of made up for the steak.

Upon persuasion from the server, I ordered the ""World's Greatest Chocolate Cake"" for dessert. Instead of banana sauce, the server put chocolate dressing instead because apparently the banana sauce ""doesn't taste like banana at all"". Either way, the chocolate cake was amazing. Very tall in height, very chocolate-y, and yet not too sweet for your tooth.

For what it's worth I likely won't return as this was just a one time thing, but I will say the employees here work very hard and I figure I should acknowledge that.",2016-07-07 21:48:34

Anyways probably would have given a 4 two years ago but today wanted to update my review (if I had one). The last two times the quality of the food was slipping and also on top f the still very slow cooks waiting for 30+ minutes for food after ordering, this has to go down to a 2 / 3.

They do have Groupon specials which gives it a more reasonable price. Still have special selection for vegetarian compared to other veggie places. However today they served some pretty poor quality food and the floor manager wanted to give us a 10% off the next time. The veggies were rotting and black and served to us. In the end they gave in another order of the same thing and in the end after 30 min it ended up being the same. 

Maybe this is just 1 bad experience as I have been here probably 15 plus times but from when I first came here the food quality is just not cutting it for the price you pay.

This was for their dinner service. Usually the dim sum is not bad and haven't had a bad experience yet for dim sum. But their dinner service is slow and now quality is just Meh.

The Crispy Chicken Skin was a small half bird deep fried with delicious moist crispy golden skin along with red rice (tomato/ketchup rice). The plate is very large and eye catching. The Rice in Clay Pot is okay, the rice is slightly brunt at the bottom so it was really crispy but it wasn't as flavorful. The Broken Rice has a lot on the plate including choice of grilled pork or ribs, it's delicious and satisfying. The HaiNam chicken is small, only few pieces but it is packed with flavor. I heard it's made from organic chicken (ga di bo) so the bird is small and skinny but very delicious, a small plate goes a long way with white flavored rice made from its chicken stock.

There was one table and bar like seating, but that's about it.
It's one of those very ""hole in the wall"" types, so make sure this would be your grab-and-go kind of stop.

I usually get some of my Japanese foods here as well, since they have some of the better quality stuff for a decent price. I usually get my udon and soba here along with soup stocks and sauces that make up the dishes. 

I love getting Korean snacks here! I wouldn't know what to do without some of them. They have an aisle full of Korean snacks and a lot of them are my favorite from my childhood when I used to visit family in Korea which is a huge plus!! 

I get a lot of meats from here as well! Specifically if I'm buying meats for KBBQ or Hot pot for home. They have a wide selection and the quality is better than most of the other supermarkets. I also get a lot of my produce here because it's usually cheaper.

Tucked away in old town Glendale, this place is a little off the beaten path (it's not on the main drag) but not too far. It's nestled in a nice area set back slightly from the street, so you get less noise than the other places along the main drag (Glendale avenue). What stands out immediately though is the decor and the ambiance of the place. There's a large aquarium in the foyer with beautiful fish, and ornate wood floors and wall siding. The restaurant has several sections that are divided off with narrow door ways, to give a bit of privacy to different groups and, I suspect, keep the noise level down. The tables are also spread apart a bit, which has the same kind of effect. There's definitely much less noise pollution when you're dining with your guests, something that is hard to achieve in most restaurant settings. You legitimately feel like you're somewhere else and not the middle of the Arizona desert when step inside this restaurant. 

Our group was immediately seated at a large table and our server was very helpful and patient with us, as we were all unfamiliar with much of the menu offerings. That's actually one thing that I would nitpick about, the menu has nearly 100 items on it and it can be a bit daunting for the uninitiated. With so many options, it's a serious mental exercise to balance the choices and figure out what sounds most appetizing. Our first challenge was the appetizer and following the server's recommendation, we tried the spring rolls and the egg rolls, all of which were fantastic, and quickly devoured. Everything was very well made and the spring rolls were fresh, crisp and simply mouth watering. 

Our main entrees were pretty diverse, including the crispy noodles and a couple of their soups (including catfish) but everyone enjoyed their food. The crispy noodles were delicious and I especially liked how they wicked up the moisture from the juices in the bowl and softened up, so that you'd get a contrast between crunchy and regular noodles to go with the vegetables and meat (chicken and beef, in my case). 

Service was fairly prompt, even though they were busy with the Friday lunch crowd and had fewer staff than I would have expected. Food service was also quick, with our meals coming out right on time as we polished off the appetizers. 

Definitely a place I'd like to go back to, because there's just so much of the menu to explore and so many different things to try. Really glad I got a chance to try this place out!",2015-01-10 07:22:00

What I like about the new expansion: 

a) Lots more parking
b) The new fancier stores (though I can't afford most of them)
c) Lots more seating so you can sit and relax while your significant other/mom/sister/etc. shops.

What I don't like:
a) There are two small courts at different sides of the mall. One is older and another one is newer.  I would prefer if they were grouped together. Maybe it's still in transition, but the new food court seemed to have all the stalls occupied. 
b) This levels/layers of the mall make things very confusing. For example, The Bay has 3 floors, but you can only gain access to the mall through the first and second floor.  Another example is H&M where there is an entrance/exit to the 3rd floor but also goes to the 2nd floor. It's cool, but confusing.
c) I don't like the layout of the mall.  It's too many corridors and quite easy to get lost.

Verdict: It's a good shopping destination, but I feel like you could spend hours in here and get very upset. lol.

PS..I hate malls.",2015-11-23 17:19:48

Basically, it's a wine shop with some fancy, made in-house chocolates.  They probably have about 20 different chocolate varieties at any given time.  The manager (at least I assume he was the manager) talked to us about the concept as far as their wine selection, tastings and the story behind the chocolates.  If I understood correctly, there is no corkage fee and you can drink your wine on the premises, but don't quote me on that.  That seems like a cool thing to do, maybe before going to dinner in the area, or even after.  From what I saw, they have a pretty good selection of mostly American and European wines.

On this visit, we both some chocolates, a bourbon flavored one, a blood orange one, a fleur de sel caramel and a dark chocolate.  They provided a nice dessert for our meal later in the evening.

The chocolates are definitely gourmet and as a result on the pricey side, but definitely worth a treat once in a while.  We will definitely return in the future.",2013-03-25 03:05:02

I was just not satisfied with my 2 star rating that I had to issue in my first review.

I wanted to give Lee's Sandwiches one more shot before I crossed them off my list forever!

This visit was a lot better and I am pleased for that. I ordered the same a BBQ pork bahn mi and asked that they put extra sauce since last time the sandwich was a bit dry. The sauce they put in the sandwich is a yummy sweet special mayo, very flavorful indeed. This time the sandwich had more filling in it like it should, more BBQ pork and pickled veggies which was really good.

I also ordered a passion fruit italian soda with the chewy gel cherry and fruit bits at the bottom as well as two chicken egg rolls which were delicious!

Although I ordered the same BBQ pork sandwich as last time, it was much better today! Lee's seems to lack consistency which is important, not good when the way your sandwich taste or is made depends on who makes it. Really do not like to have to make a 50/50 bet or roll the dice on whether or not it will be hit or miss. Not a good factor!

I will return and hopefully my order will come out and taste the same as today did rather than on my first disappointing visit.

Beef noodle flavor and broth was great but I would've loved some pickle on the side as it traditionally has. Potsticker and beef pancake weren't too exciting.

For starters, we ordered an appetizer sampler, in which we got their mild, but delectable hummus, their mediterranean dip, and their ezme salad.  All three were gone quickly enough, and the mediterranean dip was full of flavor in all the best ways.  The appetizers in general were wondrous.

For an entr√©e, I ordered a gyro platter, or something of the sort: I can't remember the exact name.  It was also pretty good, but in contrast to the appetizers and the desserts, the consensus around the table was that the entr√©es were something this fledgling business might still be working on a bit.  It was tasty, but could have used some work in presentation and perceived quality.

For dessert, we split a pistachio roll, and this alone sold us on the place: It was perfectly portioned to be split among three or four people, and the flavor was both unlike anything we had had before, and impossible to criticize.  

Another perk of the place is the Turkish tea, which is mild, slightly sweet, and of a decent quality as teas go.

We also got the same service as Yelper Susan D. We got the impression that we were a bother coming in but we got that treatment from two women working there. But I did get a smile from the one woman when she saw we stopped trying to eat and left almost all our food and she offers boxes I say no then she says, ""YOU NO LIKE"" I just smiled back and that is when I got the smile or maybe she was holding in laughing not sure.

I will say I did like the hot tea we started out with and my husband got the $3 extra soup , egg roll , crab puff add on . My husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy . I ate the crab puffs and they were fried nice and the oil seemed fresh I thought the crab puffs were better than most places because they almost looked like crabs . At this point the service didn't bother me because I thought the food would be good .

I ordered the spicy eggplant with chicken and I don't know how it was prepared but the chicken was minced unseasoned  hard and dry , the chicken was NOT EDIBLE . The sauce was not spicy it was like they dumped egg drop soup (with out the egg) over the chicken and stir fried eggplant. The thick chicken soup or sauce didn't taste good it seemed house made but it seemed like they didn't use any aromatics or salt or pepper in preparation and instead of good the sauce tasted like the way raw chicken smells also lacking any Asian Seasoning . Wong's was generous with the amount of eggplant in my dish but I couldn't stomach the sauce on it. I ate mostly steamed rice I think it was regular rice because it fell off my fork and didn't stick.

My husband ordered the Szechan Beef and neither of us could eat that one either although it was very slightly better than the spicy eggplant chicken . The beef was tough but it was seasoned but not in a good way it was very salty and I think like you dumped soy sauce on it . The sauce tasted very thick like brown gravy mixed with soy sauce and vegetables were mostly celery and a few mushrooms .

I know I already said enough but depending on where you sit in the dining room you might have a strangers butt near your face because half the dining room is raised and you might be next to that and who know, that person might need beano .

Sweet Pea and I followed him from Fate (which we loved) to Sens (which we liked a lot) and now to Sochu House (which we love.)  We've been big fans for several years and have eaten at each of his restaurants downtown many times, and after another delicious meal last night it occurred to me that I hadn't reviewed any of them!  Time to remedy that.

As a vegetarian, I am used to being under-considered.  In fact, I often tell people ""I'm a vegetarian- how good can food ever be?"" when they ask me how my meal at a restaurant is.  I love being a vegetarian, and I love the food I cook myself, but I am most often missing that foodgasm so often that I sit and watch my friends having at a restaurant.  This is not the case at Sochu House.  The man knows how to cook for carnivores AND vegetarians alike, equally as skillfully.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say his tofu is excellent, the best I've ever had.

We've been to the restaurant and ordered takeout many times, and both are top notch.  The restaurant has a cool, sexy downtown vibe, a great bar, and a great atmosphere.  Service has always been good when we've been there.  When we get takeout, they take the time to package the food in such a way that things that are crispy stay crispy, things that are fresh stay fresh, and things that are hot liquid stay in their containers.  This is far too rare at most restaurants.

I have eaten many different things there, all excellent, and I've seen others order many other things there both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and I have NEVER seen a diner unhappy with their meal.  Never.  My absolute favorite is the hot and sour soup.  It is the best I've had in my entire life, and I'm a hot and sour soup long-time fan.  It has so many lovely chunks in there- pineapples, jalepenos, delightful noodles, mushrooms, tofu, and things I don't have any clue about and frankly don't care because it is delicious.

This was followed by an also very good Lean Corned Beef on Rye, with one slice of nicely melted Swiss Cheese.  Aided by French's Yellow Mustard, the heaping sandwich was just moist enough.  A large side of Potato Salad turned out to be composed of chunks of cooked Redskin potatoes mixed in a very tasty dressing that was tossed over all.  Much of this fine dish was left behind as well.

I went here with my parents and their friends from Scotland when they were here visiting for the night.

It was restaurant week and they all got the prix fix menu while I opted to pick and chose from the regular menu.

Service- was great. Fast, responsible, we were never left waiting. The only misstep was when they brought 2 of my dishes at the same time instead of staggering them (which I would expect a tappas restaurant to do) but it was minor. 

The ambiance is great- as is the rest of the Aria. We had a huge table which accommodated the multiple plates/wine glasses without feeling cramped. 

Some notes on the dishes:

Ceviche- was great, very tart, fish and shrimp not overdone. 

Pizza- this was actually my favorite. It had a really thick almost cookie like crust that was out of this world.

Sous vide pork chop- very moist and tender. Sides were forgettable though

We got the braised beef on polenta and it was delicious.  Reason why I am not a solid 4 was because of the cheese pizza and mushroom risotto lacked a little flavor and the risotto was not fully cooked.. Will avoid pizza and that risotto on the next visit.

Their style of Mexican food is different from the rest of the restaurants. They claim to be New Mexico style. I am not sure exactly what that means since I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in Albuquerque and it is not like Arriba's. The real difference is Aribba's food is much hotter.
They have several dishes with Hatch Chilies in it. This is what I come for. I love Hatch Chile. I used to bring suitcases full of Hatch Chile from Albuquerque, grill them and put them into the freezer. 
Some times the chilies are a little hot other days it can be really hot.  Much of the time the chile is not that hot even though they will warn you when you order anything with Hatch in it. You can tell when the food enters the mouth just how hot it is going to be. Before the food touches your mouth you get that, this has the best flavor and it has not even hit your tongue yet.  Your next thought is this is going to be painfully hot. Water does not help. Four different times I have had Hatch that was almost to hot to eat. Take a bite, wait 10 min. before taking another. Unbelievably good. Unless you like it hot order something that does not have Hatch in it. 
They serve corn chips with three sauces. Bean (This can be pretty hot at times), Salsa (This is usually pretty tame), then the hot sauce. It can be pretty hot but not near what the Hatch is. 
They have daily lunch specials that are very reasonable. Every year they bring Hatch Chili in and roast them for you. Take them home put them in the freezer and when you fix you some soup put in a piece. Very Good. 
My favorite dish is the Chicken Especial. 
I am giving them 4 stars. The food deserves 5 stars the service at times is spotty. They seem to go through a lot of waiters and waitresses. Service is about a 2.5. 
Give them a try! There are several of them around town. I have only been to the one at Arrowhead.",2011-08-14 04:33:13

The Stuffed Peppers is awesome, but the Gluten Free Flatbread is crumbly and flavorless....damn, 1/2 this dish is great.

The Wild Mushroom Rotelli is very good.  The Pizza is bland....again, the gluten free Crust is what kills it for me....and I'm a big Pizza Freak, so it's hard for me to type that.

However, the wine is delicious and VERY inexpensive, the menu is HUGE - there is literally something for everyone (OYSTERS! Yum), and the service is wonderful. It is busy pretty much anytime you go, but I've never had to wait longer than 3 minutes for a table. Usually the servers are very attentive. I especially love the plate of various rolls they bring you when you sit down! It's fun to try the different options and I'm usually SO hungry so I enjoy the quick bite before I decide what I want. I love that they offer the sweet soya sauce (I previously swore off every sushi place except Sushi Boat because I hate regular soya sauce!) And of course, the free Pocky is a really nice touch, I even got a box when I bought my sister a gift certificate from here for her birthday. They also offer sushi making classes, which I think is a really neat idea. I will absolutely be back to Kinjo, again and again!!",2012-03-07 16:53:57

I always search for the perfect burger. Well this was not it. Impressive yes, muddled flavors YES.  Huge bun, green chilies, cheddar cheese, large juicy patty with no flavor and a grilled onion made up the offering. The flat bread was beautiful but so salt laden all my friend did is drink water the rest if the day to not dry up from the inside out. I'd possibly recommend MSK for cocktails after work, but for a meal, I'll not be back.

Appetizers:
Quail Egg and Bacon: These were great. They came with three wrapped eggs and were done really well. I dipped them in a bit of their homemade soy sauce. YUM. I wish there were four on the stick so we didn't have to pick who got the last one. But it was a really great appy.

King Oyster Mushroom: Not as good as the quail eggs but still ok. I won't say that I would get it again, but it was pretty good. These come with more pieces so we both got to try more of them. I liked the smoky flavor and dipping in the soy sauce really made them even better. A good vegetarian option for an appy.

Main Dish:
Beef Ramen: Spicy mustard greens, basil, onions, bean sprouts,miso broth, jalapenos. This is spicier than I thought it would be. I ended up having to blow my nose because it got things moving! I loved the broth and entire bowl was a really good mixture of flavor. I would get this again. The bowl had two different types if beef and was just good.

Santouka Ramen: Yes. I would get this again. This bowl had seaweed, tofu skin, coddled eggs, fish cake, corn, green onions, pork belly, minced pork hot sauce, and miso. Really you cannot go wrong with this dish. Also a bit hotter than expected. Cleaned out my post nasal drip! The only thing is that the corn was a bit weird for me. I didn't know how to feel about it.

The burgers are great, for the same price as McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Burger King, it is far superior and far fresher.  The wings are tasty and they have so many flavors it rivals Bdubs.  My favorite things though are the cheese curds, those can be a meal on their own.  They are cheesy crispy delicious morsels.  I know I know, what's the difference between cheese curds and mozzarella sticks?  The taste, the cheese in the cheese curds are a sharper tasting cheese.  I can't forget the $3 dollar large glass of PBR, I think it's a 36 oz., it's one of those really large beer mugs.  So to recap for $10 I can have a burger, a shot, and a beer.  Makes this gal very happy!  

The servers and bartenders are super friendly, makes you feel like a friend and feel like you're in the midwest.  The service in the kitchen can kinda be inconsistent depending on how busy they are, but even when my food comes out a little different it still tastes sooo good, so I don't even mind.

My wife and I shared the $39.95 Prix Fixe menu (Four-Course Meal for Two). We shared the ribs appetizer. Nice, sweet, a little crispy and plenty! Then soups. Egg Drop and Hot & Sour. Both delicious but the Hot & Sour was better. Not too hot and not too sour! I mentioned to the server that the Hot & Sour was better and he surprised me with a complimentary bowl! Nice touch.

Main courses, Orange Peel Shrimp and Kung Pao Chicken. White and brown rice. Both also delicious. We both took home about half of each. Desserts, The Great Wall Of Chocolate and the Carrot Cake. Only the Carrot Cake was a little disappointing. Both were the mini portions, just enough to complete the meal.

Moving on, I can see the appeal of this store as they do carry 13208923874820983534 brands of oriental specialty items like all of the candies, snacks, dried food, teas, etc. This place is packed from ceiling to the ground and the aisles were just afterthoughts! 

The produce section was borderline scary and I would never buy produce from there. With the amount of people that were in there when I was there I would think that they would have enough money to expand....or at least brighten the place up a bit!!! There wasn't too many things in the produce section that I wouldn't be able to find in another grocery store, although I'm pretty sure they would never be as cheap at another place!

Disappointed that they didn't carry any oriental dishes/cups/teapots/platters/etc.

I arrived the day of the show, actually within 40 minutes of the scheduled show time of 7pm to pick up my ticket.  The Asian lady at the ticket counter was very sweet, but I was not sure if she was messing with me when I asked to pick up my Will Call ticket for ""The Show"" and she kept asking me which show.  Eventually I got my ticket and was told that I can just walk right in to the lounge, where theater goers were already being allowed in to the seating area.

The Saxe Theater which is the site of the performance is a relatively cozy theater.  It has stadium seating, so you are pretty much guarenteed a good view of the stage (unless you are too short or sits behind someone too tall).  The chair itself is not one of those that allows you to lean back, and is not super comfortable like the ones in the Rave movie theater, but does the job.

The show itself is a vintage variety show of Vegas of old.  It has a lot of singing, dancing, a little magic, and is very entertaining.  From the comments of the out of town guests that paid for their tickets, the consensus were all positive.

The music is performed by an always visible live band that is in the background, but I really didn't pay much attention to them visually.  And their presence does not interfer or distracts you from the main action on stage.

Most of the performers are multitalented - they sing, dance, does some acting and impersonating.  There is a twin that does tap dancing and they are very good.  The magician that does a little magic was cool!  The dancers/showgirls were all excellent, and performed with energy throughout the show, and they are in excellent shape and very young looking.

Overall, I really enjoyed the entertainment from Vegas, The Show, and would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to watch it.  I think it is a good investment of your time while visiting Las Vegas.

My fianc√© and I were just looking for a light meal.  We both had sandwiches.  The sandwiches come with both fries and a salad.  The salad is in a small glass bowl, which is a great to keep it all on one plate, but not the hot sandwich and fries with the cold salad.  The salad also contains mixed greens and arugula.  Way better than some cheap iceberg lettuce side salad.  The fries are perfect, crispy, and not salty.  I had the french dip, she had a chicken sandwich, both were good.

The restaurant is big.  It's more or less divided into the bakery/coffee bar and the dining room.  THere's also a nice patio.  My only complaint about the service was the server (who I think he was actually the owner) was a little aggressive in the beginning).  Not in a bad or impolite way.  He just a little pushy about asking what specials we wanted to hear about.  They have entire menu of specials.  We barely had sat down and looked at it, so it was awkward, and confusing.

We were looking for a late night dinner and luckily, this place was right across the street from our hotel. We walked by and peeked inside. Everyone was dressed nice. We decided to go in anyway and see if I could get some food to go. A manager spotted us and said hi. I thought he was going to kick us out for looking like scrubs, but instead he escorted us to some tables. He seated us at a table with a little ""occupied"" sign and took the sign away. Sweet concept. I felt like a VIP even though I was in sweats at a posh lounge. It was as if, the lounge was whispering to me ""we were expecting you, Mr. Elite Yelper"". 

We ended up ordering the roast beef sandwich and a prosciutto/apple pizza. Both entrees were freakin' awesome. The sandwich had tender slices of roast beef, thick slices of smoked bacon, and a fried egg, blanketed in a soft ciabatta roll. It had a side of onion strings and some sort of phenomenal slaw. The pizza was fantastic as well. It was a white pizza, with Fontina cheese, thin slices of prosciutto, and apples. Odd combination, but it worked really well together. 

The thing I like about this place is the character. The building use to be an old department store, but they managed to convert it to a lounge. The crowd here is very trendy/hipster. They had a DJ spinning some techno/hip-hop and some really trippy (but classy) d√©cor. I like the gutted elevator shaft and the high ceilings. What kind of grossed me out is the fitting room, converted bathrooms. They're uni-sexed, but pretty disgusting. Just think about what it's like to take a dump in a fitting room with no ventilation. Yup, it's exactly what you are probably imagining. 

Overall, I really liked this place. The kitchen is open pretty late, the food is excellent, there's no cover, and the food/drink prices are reasonable. The wife and I dropped about 50 bucks post tip/tax on roast beef sandwich, pizza, and two cocktails. This a great place to to start your night, but I would recommend using the restrooms at your next stop. I would definitely come back again.

I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.",2012-02-12 16:01:38

Foundation Room is hands down about the view. It does block out the view of Luxor (unlike mix) however it has a great view of the strip. The outside patio was underwhelming and looked very plain...maybe because I was there late afternoon....The inside had the same theme as Mandalay Bay in the subtle south east asian vibe...very antique looking...again this maybe because there was a lot of natural sunlight in the venue (majority of nightlife venues would look underwhelming during the day...)...very private venue that feels catered towards the older crowd

The apps being passed around were decent...not horrible but not great.

With the store divided into sections according to styles from vintage, to pastel, summer wear, club wear, hippie, to denim and many more, It's not hard to stay in one or two areas most of the time - then you realize you've spent half the day inside and the sun has already set.

If there's but one thing to bear in mind with any forever21, quality should be the last thing you should go there for. You shop there because the prices are affordable not because they're going to last. With that said, expect copious amounts of different trendy designs sometimes stacked in the same hanger-to-hanger pile. It's necessary to shift through the contents for awhile before you could find something worth buying. 

Shoes shouldn't be an option, they'll give you blisters for the most part. Tights and basics are sold at affordable prices. They tend to rotate the styles around different sections of the store monthly so one day you might find the new spring collection by the shoes, the next week, it's pushed to the back of the store - not exactly convenient for regular shoppers.

There's a DJ experience on certain days and the place can feel so much like a club - minus the alcohol xD My mom and I drop by the place when we've got time to spare.

I thought it would be another Earls/Moxies/Milestones/Kelsey's/Casey's/Pickle Barrel/all other suburban chain restaurants.  However, this place surprised me!

Atmosphere:  dim, reclaimed look, mix between a bar/sports bar/restaurant.  This West Coast chain would definitely fit in downtown and would do equally well in a mall-setting!

Food:  I only had the Halibut Tacos ($12/2, apps) and a mojito ($8.50, pretty tall glass).  I wasn't that hungry, so the tacos were sufficient in size.  As far as the drink was concerned, it was a fairly good serving for the price.

If at all possible, I really try to avoid chain-restos, so I haven't been to any of the above mentioned places in years.  However, from what I do remember, what sets Browns apart is that there are daily drink specials and even a $5 everyday drink menu.

Entire food menu is online and it consisted of the usual suspects:  salads, burgers, pizza, pasta, and some ""Social Bowls"" which were a mix of rice + salad + a protein in a decent serving size.

First impressions were positive. The space is bright and airy and open in concept. I love the little details they've included like yellow shipping container napkin dispensers, and sunny yellow chairs that brighten up the otherwise contemporary wood detailed space. There is a good amount of space and ventilation to minimize the ""leaving the restaurant smelling like what you ate"" effect. Even the wait staff outfits with canvas and leather detailed aprons, the giant Popeye statue that you can't miss when you walk in (and are tempted not to take a selfie with), the eye catching branding, and the expansive bar with 18 taps for craft beer have all been thoughtfully considered. 

Now for the food. This place is trying NOT to be another Captain Boil restaurant. Similar to CB, they do serve Louisiana-style boiled seafood with a seasoning of your choice, priced per pound (and noted to be $1 less per pound than the seafood prices at CB). However they also have lobster rolls, soft shell crab sandwiches and baskets, lobster bisque, and will have ciders and craft beer (pending liquor license approval). I like that unlike CB, they use glassware, non-disposable utensils, and food is served in washable reusable containers (rather than plastic bags) for less environmental impact. The food was pretty decent. I ordered the soft shell crab basket and subbed out fries with a Caesar salad ($2 extra). The better deal is the soft shell crab sandwich which comes with salad and fries ($12.95). The lobster bisque had some chunks of lobster in it and had rich flavour.

They are still working out the kinks as that is what soft openings are for. My hubby's meal came out late but at least his salad was served with salad dressing unlike his mom's salad. My father in law was served what seemed like hard crusted rice, which was replaced quickly with fresh steamed rice upon complaint. They don't yet have their liquor license. The soft shell crab we were served was oilier than the fries served with it. All that being said, these bits of constructive feedback were fed back to one of the owners Tony who was eager to listen and improve customer experiences.

Would I come back to Good Catch? Absolutely! Even though on the surface they seem like another seafood boil restaurant, they are working to set themselves apart from the other restaurants of similar concept. I am looking forward to coming back in a few weeks after they've ironed out the hiccups identified during the soft opening and when they execute their full vision, and I can enjoy my meal with craft beers and ciders. 

3.5 stars.

Basil Thai is a great place to walk by and smell the smells. You read that right; the restaurant gives off an intoxicating aroma that is downright incredible. Sadly, I didn't find the taste lived up to that amazing scent this time.   

We tried many of the appetizers which I thought were good. I especially enjoyed the stuffed shrimp and basil rolls. For my entree the server recommended the Chicken Prik King with medium spice. While it was spiced just fine, the dish primarily consisted of under-cooked string beans. My meal had very little chicken (or anything other than the beans) and the squeaky texture was off-putting.  

Our server took so long to take the order (almost an hour after we sat) so I just kind of dealt with what I was served because I was really hungry at that point. Once the order was taken it did move along a little faster thankfully. Overall our server was a nice guy so no complaints as far as that goes. 

The place itself is very nice and can accommodate a larger party nicely due to the back room. I've gone for drinks and they have always been delicious. One other thing to mention is that prices are pretty high, probably due to the Uptown rent.

The first problem was that fries didn't come with the burgers. (Wait, but why?!) Instead, we had to order fries to share. Got the white truffle aioli fries and they were pretty good. Server told us that one order of the fries would be enough for the five of us, but she was kind of wrong.

Second problem. My burger was made wrong. Way more cooked than I had requested. I'm not really much of a complainer (in person, I mean), so I just tried to eat it. I ordered the Dockburger mostly because I just wanted more fries, so I literally only ate the fries and two bites of the actual burger and couldn't do anymore.

Third problem was the service. Yes it was a Saturday night so yes they were busy, but they were just really, really slow with everything. We spent a lot of the time watching the pizza guy make pizza because the kitchen was right next to us. Oh, so was the bathroom. It's a pretty cramped space, but I was not a fan of how the bathroom was literally right next to our table. I mean we had a guy dressed up as Santa chat with us while he waited for the bathroom (SantaCon was going on) and that was nice, but a table right next to the bathroom just wasn't the best spot. Also, my friend ordered a beer and it literally came AFTER she paid for her meal, and by then she was too full. She wasn't charged for the beer, but not once during the meal was she told by the server why she still didn't have her beer yet. 

The 25-minute wait was fine, but of course, if I had known earlier all the things above, I would not have waited that long.

I felt like i was going to some elite/forbidden place which made me like it even more. The back story of this place is pretty cool too but i wont ruin it for you.

The pricing on shrimp was amazing too!! And high quality to boot. I know because I'm a food snob.

paj-j9N_BIfTGATqOfem8A,lNDoRrMrdrK-Gd8Yllgpkg,g-I48SaHtdIGR5ZEoVeNFw,3,3,1,2,"Prologue:
My fiancee and I were looking for a new sushi experience for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date and a search on Yelp of sushi restaurants close to home yielded this restaurant along with some good reviews.


The Plot:
It was apparent from our review of the menu, as well as the signage posted in the restaurant, that they offered a greater variety items compared to the other sushi restaurants we've already tried.

So, we decided to be adventurous and order several dishes to share, including Deep Fried Baby Octopus, Pork Tonkatsu, Dynamite, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Rainbow Roll, and Uni Nigiri.


The Scene:
Most impressive for us was the presentation, particularly the extra effort that apparently had been given to plating the maki rolls. The Soft Shell Crab roll was actually a little creepy looking, which made it even more fun to eat.

All of the other dishes were good and on par with favorable dining experiences I've had in the past. The Baby Octopus was warm, crispy, and yummy, the Pork Tonkatsu was juicy, tender, and delectable, and the Dynamite was savory and satisfying.

The service was courteous, our orders were all promptly delivered to our table, and the meal, overall, was quite delightful.


The Rest of the Story:
Everything was as good as expected and there were no disappointments.
At the same time, there were no real stars in this meal. Considering the variety and the number of specialty items on their menu, another visit might reveal something more memorable.

My fiancee was a little surprised when the tab came to about $70; however, having had similar dining experiences in the past I was fully expecting to pay that much.


Epilogue:
The quality of the food and the variety of items on the menu easily deserve 3 stars.

Never the less, this dining experience did not rank among the best $70 meals we've had and so we elected to not award a 4th star.

Upon entering the establishment, you will notice traditional Asian decor and a peaceful ambience. he hostesses are quick and polite to greet you and will take no more than ten minutes to seat you on a busy day.
Offering the best of Korean cuisine and all-you-can-eat sushi, every server is attentive and caring of their customers, offering constant refills and checking in very often. Though I'm not a big fan of Korean cuisine, the sushi keeps me going back. Most notable in my opinion were Tiger, Black Dragon, Vegas and Sexy rolls. The Salmon nigiri is very fresh, and their drink variety is nothing to complain about.
Equally impressive was how clean Kaya is kept! Most small-time food places, from my experience, are not well-kept. Even their bathroom is immaculate.

Also there don't have fried quails on their menu, something I always order when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Will not return again. One thing that's good about this place is that the service is good, the dining atmosphere is probably a little better than the other two Vietnamese restaurants on South Blvd. They also take Amex, which is a plus.

We got the Box combo which is like 4 tenders, Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and drink.  I welcome this new kind of fast food restaurant in my neighborhood!  Its nice that you can get this kind of combo vs the traditional burger, fry, drink thing.  The prices are a tiny bit hefty - its just shy of Chipotle prices, I got this combo for roughly the price of a burrito.  

That said, the tenders were pretty good!  Not overly breaded, fried right and not too greasy.  Not a huge fan of the Cane sauce - its not terrible but very negligible.  However, I do believe if you run a restaurant selling pretty much nothing but chicken tenders, you HAVE to offer more of a variety of sauces.  McDonald's offers 2 things - nuggets and tenders which comprise of what, 10% of the menu?  And they have like 10 sauces!  Anyway, more sauce options please!

The toast and the fries were slightly less done than I prefer.  The coleslaw was ok - not too exciting.  The service was GREAT, staff are pretty friendly - of course there were only 4 customers..  The atmosphere is fun and modern - random posters and pictures on the walls.

I feel bad for not agreeing with my fellow yelpers. The BF and I were excited to try HK Star, but was utterly dissappointed with the quality of the food and service. As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with an unpleasant scent that reminded us of being in a pet store. Immediately after being seated, we were asked if we were ready to order prior to even looking at our menu's. Customer service could use some improvement. Typically going to a restaurant you would expect a certain level of service (ie. not having to ask for refills after being there for an hour).  

As for the food aspect, I feel that the quality was not very authentic. I would not recommend HK Star as a top Chinese restaurant. We ordered the Beef Chow Fun with black bean sauce, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Chinese Broccoli with garlic. They made a mistake and brought out Beef Chow Fun with BROWN GRAVY instead of black bean sauce. However, the server was kind enough to correct the order. The noodles were overcooked and the honey walnut shrimp was mediocre - I actually think the Honey Walnut Shrimp at Panda Express has more flavor. The Chinese Broccoli was tough and leafy. To top it off, they had disturbing content of weird looking insects being prepared and cooked on their tv's. Not very appetizing when eating.

I wanted to try the frites, as I had read the reviews and you Yelpers consistently recommend them. We ordered some for the table as a started. They did not disappoint. I've never had frites that were that addictive! I think I stopped talking the moment they arrived, and didn't come up for air until they were gone. So perfectly delicious and the garlic dijion mayo was a perfect pairing for dipping...and I don't even like mayo!
I ordered the Vegetable frittata of the day, which had Gouda, carmelized onions, tomatoes, and a heavenly pesto sauce. It was really tasty and fresh, and served with chilled fruit which was a nice light touch. I don't think I've ever had a better frittata. It was perfectly cooked and the quality of ingredients was apparent. My wife ordered the eggs diablo, which I obviously sampled. I really loved the sauce, but I'm not a huge fan of banana peppers so it wouldn't be something I would order. There were a few veggie friendly choices on the menu, so we had more than one option when choosing our lunch/brunch. The other folks at our table got meaty type dishes and raved about them.

My food was inedible. 

Their tom yum was a poor amateur of the real deal, if you know Thai food and this dish you'll know what I'm getting at with the description of what l was served.  This dish only had the following:  two small shrimp, squid, unshelled mussels, jalapenos, ginger and thinly sliced button mushrooms.  The dish wasn't sweet or sour, it was however extremely salty, the seafood was overcooked big time and the side of white rice was gelatinous from too much water when it was cooked, the grains stuck together instead of being light and fluffy. 

lt didn't have the typical additional ingredients of fresh thai chili, lemon grass, tamarind, mussels in the half shell, seafood cooked medium, fresh spiced tomatoes, chili flakes, fresh lime and other garnish toppings. It lacked greatly in presentation, taste and aroma.  

Two others in my party where also disappointed in their dish too.  

I'm not Thai, but am very familiar with the food and have made it myself a number of times. lt's just nice to have it elsewhere without having to do all the prep and other work involved in it.

The few times I've been, I keep hoping for the seitan wings to get better. They haven't. Two times I got violently ill from them, and I'm not new to BBQ sauce or seitan. After that, I stopped trying. I returned once more to meet friends and only ordered the Junkyard Nachos to prevent further damage to my stomach. The BBQ sauce was definitely delicious, so I give them some credit. The food is your typical fare of bar food and basic restaurant dishes. My carnivore friends rave about the food though, so if you aren't vegan/vegetarian, it's worth a shot!

Drink specials are not bad. I've returned simply to have a drink with friends, but likely won't have a full meal involving seitan again.",2018-02-16 01:36:27

Ghostbusters was a great movie that showed viewers that a library can be a fun and exciting place.

He gave out 300 copies of ""The Tao of Wu"". I had a great time and will always remember this experience. At least until dementia hits. It has been a few years since I have been back to the lie-berry. My friend commented how he remembered a field trip to CPL and he saw the world's smallest book.

However, they taste much like every other Thai place I've been to.  The food is good, but not a standout.

Nigiri: 3/5 They definitely serve more rice and less fish here. I usually get a huge clump of rice and a small thin thin thin slice of fish. Everyone knows rice fills people up quicker. So its kind of shady how they con people into eating a lot of rice to fill them up. 

Rolls: 2/5 I'm not much of a roll person but when I eat AYCE I like to try a little bit of everything and Kaya is the only sushi restaurant that I go to that doesn't allow half rolls until the last roll of your dinner. Which makes it sucky to even try rolls because usually 1 roll can fill me up with all that rice. 

Appetizers: 4/5 Only if you get AYCE everyone knows you never really get your moneys worth in sushi unless you go All you can eat. Their baked green mussels are pretty good out of my top 3 its my 2nd favorite, although they take kind of long to come out they're usually never burnt or over cooked and there's a balanced amount of yum yum sauce to mussel. Sea weed salad, if your not doing AYCE  sea weed salads a small portion and not worth it but with AYCE you can order as many as you want.

I'm glad that there is a place like this in the valley. Lord knows this place could use just one or two real legit indie bookstores.

But still...there is an opportunity to educate the community on lots of things. I do like that they have lots of events and lots of variety in their events. I know that a business here still needs to know their audience and I think Changing Hands does that fairly well.

It was relatively empty on a Monday afternoon - I was surprised by that.  Being inside of a Catholic church that isn't a church anymore is kind of trippy.  It's definitely an interesting experience.

As I already mentioned, I loved the food.  Every single member of my party had nothing but fantastic things to say about the food...the service, however, will keep me from ever returning.  Which is a pretty major thing to say, but our waitress was really frustrated she was assigned our table and had no qualms about showing it.  We made reservations in advance so Church Brew Works knew we were coming, we didn't pop up out of nowhere.  Still, it seemed we were ruining a perfectly fine slow Monday for our waitress.  The poor new girl, who was left to deliver our food by herself, was so new to the restaurant that she couldn't identify which dish was which.  At the end, after growing frustrated with any requests we had (which was for a lemon in a glass of water) to not bringing out any water for those who requested it, our waitress threw a tantrum when the leader of our party signed the check but accidentally took the wrong copy with him.  She nastily replied that she couldn't believe he wouldn't leave a tip and harassed a few of those left behind.  At least three members of our party complained to the manager.  It was a series of unfortunate events, but what Church Brew Works accomplished was turning away 17 potential repeat customers.

loved their bread and the special seasoned olive oil... had cocktail shrimp as appetizer which was, hm, just so-so.... not really stands out... entrees were excellent on the other hand... the lamb, fish, steak... and scallop! (her recommendation too!) we all loved it! 

when we asked for the desert menu, she whispered to me again and said 'you have stuff coming, you wanna see the portion first before you order more?' i said sure... and they came.............. there were two complimentry deserts, one has 'happy birthday' written, the other said 'congratulation!'.... they were HUGE... and i believe it's the warm chocolate cake from their menu... oh YUMMY!!!!! sure enough, that filled us up... we didn't have to order more...

The hostess was real friendly greeting me at the door.  The dining space was spacious but felt very similar to one of those roadside diners that you might see on a long trip or in a half-lighted neon poster with Bogart, Dean, and Monroe.  Yeah, that kind of joint.

The nigiris are pretty big! They were also very fresh, especially the ebi(shrimp) nigiri! I go to many sushi places and they're always mediocre quality but this place serves the shrimp perfectly! I liked how they did half rolls as well so you can have more variety before getting full! The rolls are yummy too!

The service wowed me even more! As soon as I walked in they were all so nice, welcoming, and friendly! I asked for take out at first and the waitress sat me at the bar unlike most places that just let you stand or sit at the benches! 

I love this place and will definitely be coming back! I haven't found too many sushi places that get my shrimp fresh and big like they do (besides extremely expensive high end sushi restaurants!) this one is a really good deal for 26.95 :)))) thanks to them!",2017-01-31 07:32:31

Not so busy during the week to get a quick bite for lunch.. But I wouldnt be surprise if they will be soon

Staff are great and explained the different types of hotdogs they got to offer... 

Parking is limited as there are other places to eat in the area.. 

Something about their hotdog buns that makes the meal truly amazing! The hotdog was very tasty and the awesome toppings they offer works very well!!

The chicken itself was tasty but not the best. The white meat is juicy and not very oily but the flavour was only ok. The hot sauce they gave you was not even hot.. mild tasted like a tangy tomato sauce and the hot sauce at best is a mild... potatoes were not crispy and the rice tasted like uncle ben rice. 

Service was also only ok.. the girls that worked there spoke in their own language and was rude with certain customers. Portion size was big though... saving grace is their portugese tart is very good so if i were to ever come back (which wont happen) i would just get the tart.

The menu offers sandwiches, wraps, and pastries, all vegan-friendly.  The cafe itself is a bit dark and musty, but it was still jam-packed when we were there. Scratch posts are laid out sporadically with little hammocks in which cats were napping away.  When the hubs and I walked in, there was a cute black and white cat, sitting by the sink, just staring at the patrons waiting in line. HA!  On little tables, there are even lint rollers, just in case you were getting all touch-happy and have to clean yourself afterwards.

Cool space,  extremely nice vibe.   Old Johnny Cash playing as I walked in the door.   No football on the screens   though.   Nice bar, retro.   I sat in the middle and made eye contact with the bartender when I arrived.   There were 6 other patrons.   I was the only newcomer. 

That's where it got strange.   Bartender started fiddling with the cash register and chatting with patrons 3 stools away.   For over 5 minutes.   Then she walked away to the back.   Meanwhile,  I sat and waited.   Finally I decided to bail after 6-7 minutes. 

NOTE to proprietor.   This is a NEIGHBORHOOD bar.   The neighbors in this hood will support you if you welcome them and provide friendly service.   I got the big-ass cold shoulder today in your bar.   I won't be back.

The meat dishes are cooked-to order and served with an afghan flatbread which is crisper than indian naan, but still quite tasty, as well as salad and optionally rice.

I've had the lamb chops (Choppan) and beef (Barg), both of which are quite nice, but my favourite are the chicken kabobs, which are surprisingly juicy despite having been grilled. It's easy to overcook chicken, but Bamiyan does not.  I've seen lots of others, but haven't tried them all yet.  

Basically, I wouldn't suggest that you go up to Overlea just to eat here, but if you're in the area, you definitely want to go here rather than somewhere else quite nearby.

Having never been, I checked out the buffet, which had a great selection, I was a little overwhelmed and asked to order from the menu. Maybe not the right choice since the menu was 7+ pages long, with very little descriptions.  I started with the spring rolls & peanut sauce, and the egg drop soup, both very good. I then ordered the shrimp with vegetables and fried rice. The portions were very large, which I enjoyed for dinner, but both good.  I will say the fried rice was the BEST I have found in Charlotte!
As for the three, here goes.  Although the food was good, I was disappointed with the overall service.  There are plenty of waiters there to attend to you, however, there isn't one specifically assigned to your table so there are different people bringing the water, meal, receipt, etc. which turned out to be a mess. And, without knowing how the restaurant works I felt a little out of place.

Last night I finally got the chance to experience this place. Some of My friend couldn't make it to my wife's birthday dinner celebration so we decided to get together to make it up. 
I liked that The parking lot is huge, plenty of parking for sure. Once we walked in, it felt like I stepped right into the 1970's. There is a foyer where a hostess is there to seat you. If there is a wait you can always go to the fireside lounge that's located inside Peppermill to the left of the restaurant side. (It's open 24 hours ) unfortunately The place had a stuffy smell it almost smelled like throw up,  that was a very off putting smell to experience before your about to eat. Plus the restroom were very dirty and close to the foyer. 
Our booth  was directly behind the hostess podium on the other side of the glass so we kept getting random whiffs. 

Hiromi was our waitress she was very friendly. And understanding when We took our time  choosing our orders we started with mozzarella sticks. My wife ordered the California Burger, I ordered the BLT&A with curly fries, my friends ordered the Peppermill Burger, Peppermill Pastrami Burger And the Fresh Fruit Salad. 

Service was 100% amazing. the food was so good and generously portioned. My BLT&A was so big & packed with bacon and avocado. I got the mayo on the side but didn't use any, because the sandwich was great just the way it is. 

My three star review is based on the rank smell and dirty restrooms . plus we thought it was weird that we had to wait in line to pay for our meals . it took us even longer because we had to split the check. And to top it off we had drinks added to our check we never ordered. It wasn't an issue but the fact the our waitress had to be called over to verify took us even longer to pay for our meals.",2018-03-26 07:44:04

The food wasn't bad.  It just wasn't great.  We started out with the calamari which was very good and certainly better than average calamari.  I got a special which was a mix of mussels and clams in a wine/herb broth.  The broth was nice, the clams were meaty, but I don't know what went wrong with the mussels.  It appeared that they had been cooked to death to the point where they and just about completely disintegrated.  My date got the lobster ravioli.  The presentation was nice but the dish was devoid of flavor.  Lobster is a very distinctive flavor and if you are eating it, you know it.  I could not discern much lobster flavor in this ravioli.  There really wasn't much flavor otherwise either.  We were ""cheating"" in getting this rich dish on a week night with the pasta and cream sauce.

The room, the puzzles, the story, the host/master, the waiting room decor, everything was carefully thought out and well executed. The employees were all friendly and with a great sense of humor. 

Our son chose the Shanghaied game, which was the most difficult game available that day (9.1, I believe) and it was tough. We got out in 52 minutes but we definitely needed a few hints. I'd love to go back and do a lower rated one and try to not get any hints. 

I definitely recommend Escapology whether you're looking for a group activity for adults, with your kids, or even for date night. It is so much fun to get away from your normal routine and away from your smartphones and tv to play a challenging game where you're required to work together.

For one, 6pm and the place started to fill up with families! In a high end bistro with a big central bar this wasn't really something I was expecting, I hadn't realized this Brasserie had a kids menu! Let alone a well developed menu clearly devoted to kids' taste with mini burgers, mac n' cheese, fish n' chips, chicken fingers. The parents seemed to settle into this dim and amazing smelling resto, order a glass of wine and a very nice meal and glow with gratitude while their kids happily mellowed out as well while they picked their favourites. 

Let's be clear - kids menu items are all around $10 so this is definitely not budget dining, it's Outremont families doing their thing, but for what it is, it's smart and welcoming. 

One thing that bugged me: I told the person at the door that I just wanted to have a drink at the bar and she said go ahead, and only after I'd ordered a drink did the bartender realize I hadn't been told that I had to eat if I was drinking - they have one of those licenses.

The electronics section is pretty awesome too.  We've bought multiple electronics from here.  The store is always clean and the staff is always friendly.  Items that we come here for:

When having a party:

Meat - Bulk is always cheaper!  The ribs (sold in 3 racks) are always a steal
Cheese - always way cheaper than grocery stores
Produce - in some cases cheaper than purchasing small bulks (like lettuce, apples etc)
Alcohol - seems to always be better prices than the stores-the beer is priced similar to regular stores.
Plates/cups etc - good selection and good price
Freezer section - great selection - lots of party food to throw in the oven
Chips/bread - family size bags of chips.  I recently bought some bread and got it home and it was moldy.  Bummer

For everyday items:
Rotisserie chicken - $4.99 Can't beat it
Soda/Gatorade/kids juice - Definitely great deals you wouldn't want to shop anywhere else
Detergent - cheaper and huge (we usually refill a smaller jug because it so big
Golf shirts - the BF has found some awesome brand name golf shirts here
Peanut butter - a medium size is as much as the two large at Sam's
Meat section - always good to buy and package by serving size
Frozen chicken breast - packaged by serving size (6oz).  10 lb bag $21.00

Just some items to give you an idea.  This store is a membership.  I believe I bought my membership for $35 or $40 for annual pass.  They have a cafeteria style place in the front of the store that you can get very cheap drinks and food-I mean FOR DOLLARS.  You can feed the whole fam with hotdogs and pizza with drinks for under $10.00.  

My only complaint about this store really is they just installed the self check outs and they don't have anyone monitoring these lanes.  Saturday it seemed like every lane had issues scanning but there wasn't anyone there to help.  They really need to keep those flowing a little smoother or why have them?

***Don't forget the gas.  Amazed that it actually closes in a 24 hour city but the prices are always great and who doesn't love cheaper gas prices?

The food options on the menu is pretty basic, but the drink menu, oh my. As you may have noticed in their name, this place is famous for its cider and they really make it worth it. All the brunch drinks and cocktails have a cider twist and they also have lots of craft ciders to choose from. We had three different ounces and they all turn out to be great.

Open Sesame combines a few of my great loves, namely:
1. Quiet places where you can actually talk to those you came with.
2. The ability to customize your meal and choose what you're putting in your mouth.
3. An opportunity to cheat the system in a big way. (The broccoli secret!)

I'll get to number three in a hot minute here, but for now, let's go through the particulars.

First things first, this place is set up all Mongoli-Grill-gone-classy. I like bringing friends and dates here because you can have a conversation next to a giant roaring fireplace and not have to compete with the UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE of a terrible DJ (See my review for 1600 Bier Haus) or the autotuned drivel of top 40 radio. 

Suffice to say the place is pretty swanky - nice booths, a big ol' fireplace, a cool layout. You might need a reservation on the weekends as this place can get kind of busy.

I've also got to stop here and recommend their Pomegrante Iced Tea. It's not sweetened, but unless you're some sort of 12 year old with zero class that shouldn't bother you much. Less sugar is good for you anyways.

But now, on to the single best part of this restaurant where I reveal THE BROCCOLI SECRET!!

Instead of paying for your bowl by weight, you just get a bowl and the mandate to ""cram as much in there as humanly possible"". 

I like that. I like a restaurant that rolls the dice on my ability to take more food than I will ever be able to eat in a single sitting. And here, friends, is exactly how you do that:

Broccoli.

If you don't like broccoli you can use tomatoes instead, but Broccoli has those leafy tops that are dense and easier to stack. All you've gotta do is fill your bowl up as you normally would - but when you're coming close to that 65% mark, take broccoli and run them around the entire edge of your bowl. BOOM, SUCKA! Your bowl's ability to house food just increased by quite literally 50%. If you're really talented you can do a broccoli ring on TOP of a broccoli ring, but at that point your server might start to give you dirty looks. 

Ignore them. This is your moment to shine. They enabled you. They created this monster. Run with it.

In the end, this is a great place for a meal, a party,  date night or just a ""need to pile enough food into a bowl to last for tomorrow's lunch and also the day after"" occasion.",2012-04-07 17:39:15

From the moment I walk in the experience begins.  You have a friendly greeting from the staff as you walk through the door. They are so helpful too! If you don't already have a tasting card I recommend adding some $ to a card. This is key because it allows you hit up the wine kiosk to taste some of the featured wines. So much fun. The cost of the tasting varies depending on the wine but the range is round .40 cents to a few bucks for a 1 oz pour. Try a few and then purchase your favorite. When shopping the store they have creative descriptions of the wines and recommended pairings. They also group by occasion (if you need an occasion to drink wine)  after picking a bottle or two they will hold on to your wine at the counter as you continue looking around. Then when ready to pay they will pack your wines carefully in these cool bags. Great wines at reasonable prices,2017-09-23 16:56:25

- hot and sour soup...DELICIOUS!! For some reasons I got two of those (maybe I didn't express myself clearly);
- fried rice was also good and even more tasty with some soy sauce on it (eat it hot cause it tends to dry up);
- sweet and sour pork...and here's why I don't give 5 stars: it was very mushy and pretty tasteless even with additional sauce. Too bad. It's one of my favorite dishes of the Chinese cuisine.

My coworker and I wanted to check it out and so we stopped in last Monday afternoon. The space is essentially a garage with cool rustic finishes. It's a bright, pleasant little place.

They do a lunch menu with smaller portions but still plenty of options. Each entree comes with either lemongrass mushroom soup or a spring roll (or both for an extra dollar). My friend and I couldn't choose, so we opted for both. The soup was served very hot and was a nice starter. The little spring roll was also good, but it didn't really stand out from other spring rolls I've had in the past.

I ordered chicken in garlic sauce (which also had broccoli, carrots, and greens) served with white rice. I have ordered this dish from other places in the past, and have found that it is usually packed with flavor--unfortunately this time I found it to be pretty bland. The portion was generous (despite being the smaller lunch size), but I just felt like it was missing something.

Initially I meant to go to Tofu Hut, however I was not going to wait an hour for it. Hunting on Yelp, I discovered Korean Garden BBQ House. What interested me were their pricings: 

They have 3 different pricings: Nevada $14-15.99, Las Vegas $19.99, and Spring Mtn $22-23.99. Nevada having the shortest list of items to Spring Mtn having the longest list of items - depending on which pricing you choose, you may choose as many items on that list to your liking.

I chose the Las Vegas pricing (Nevada pricing does not offer Japchae or Bulgogi.) I ordered Japchae, Marinated Chicken, Bulgogi, and Pork Belly. Second Round something Rib Fingers, Bulgogi, Beef Brisket, and something item that slipped my mind. The portions of meat were huge considering two types of meat were on one plate. 

The service was meh (staff forgot a couple of items we asked for) which doesn't help when the menu states - parties of 5 OR LESS 15% gratuity is already included -_- poop. I guess you can't complain(maybe you can) because the staff does cook and cut the meat for you. 

Like what other YELPers say - staff in the beginning are attentive and helpful, however later on... they just aren't haha. The bill took a while to arrive that I ended up walking up to the counter and paying - bout $50 for my meal. 

You may not make this mistake (I did) so just a note, do the math for the pricing you choose - add tax(8.1%) and 15% gratuity to make sure you actually want to pay $xx.xx for this meal (since now you can't choose how much gratuity to give but can choose what pricing you'd like)

I could have lived without the Japchae and if I could, would have left just 10% to 13% gratuity.",2014-06-16 10:20:14

This place was almost like a piece of heaven when I realized that I actually got to go TO the store. This is the main art supply company that I used in college, but we only ordered through the magazine. I love getting to go in and browse through random art supplies and brainstorming ideas.

(1) Supplies - they have just about anything you need. Maybe they don't have everything you want, but they can probably order it. For most mediums though they have solid supplies and very reasonable prices. I go in there for work supplies as an Art Director but almost always walk out with something for myself. 

(2) Service - The service is always great. They are super helpful and most of them really know what they are doing. I've been rambled about ideas and they helped me figure out what I needed to execute said idea. It's nice to go into a store where the people there actually belong there.

(3) Location - Ok this is where it lost a star. This place is in a pretty crappy area BUT luckily it's on the way to/from one of our printers so I can swing in on a regular basis.

We paid our way and cruised around the current exhibit which is called ""Races"". While there were quite a few families there, I wouldn't say it's solely for children. My friend and I had a pretty good time and there are a lot of interesting exhibits and demonstrations. We spent probably a good two hours there, and we didn't visit the IMAX or planetarium (which is an extra cost).

 At least we have a bus, but useless in helping you out if you're not near on a main street going to a simple destination. When I first moved here, I used the RTC Tropicana line down to the strip. That was A-OK, easy enough and I'd give it a 3.5 star, until one day they had nearly started a riot. We had ridden the bus a few blocks down from my stop and told us the bus got hit last night and that they were taking it off service and another bus is on the way...maybe 10-15 minutes away. This was during peak morning hours where it was a jam packed extra length bus of people who worked in the casinos- we can't be fucking late! WTF? Why didn't they take the bus off last night when it got hit or taken it off service at the end stop of a route or why didn't they have the new bus go ahead of time and be waiting for us at that stop? IDIOTS in high places couldn't figure this simple solution out, but I sometimes feel they really don't give a damn about standards since what other alternative do bus riders have to the RTC? Yeah, many people were yelling, walked out and RAN to the strip, some walked to the Orleans to catch cabs, some like me stayed. I figured whatever I do, I'll be late and I was late. I had to run from the stop by Tropicana Hotel all the way to Planet Hollywood to make it 5 minutes before opening up shop in Miracle Mile. Pffft. It ruined my day having angry customers banging on the door while I'm trying to count out and open the register in a hurry and knowing I had one strike on my tardy record added. 

And when it comes to getting to other places around the city, forget it. I route a few spots that seemed simple enough to get to, it was like 2-4 bus transfers and a good 30 minute walk. It was pretty laughable to get 10 miles away it would take me that many bus stops and about 2-3 hours. It just means for things like that, people should have bicycles and they'll also get a nice exercise and be there in 30-60 minutes. 

Regular RTC gets a ONE star. 

Now why the 4 star after talking the smack about the CAT bus? 

Well, it's for the ACEXpress lines that restored my faith that they are trying to improve.

There is a ACEXpress C-Line that just opened up by my house in Centennial Hills. The transit starts at the Transit Station on N Durango and Elkhorn, goes on the 95FWY and stops at 4th St and Fremont in downtown, then goes to the Premium Outlets on Grand Central, then to the side of TI on Spring Mtn., Howard Hughes and Corporate Dr. and in front of UNLV. 

It wasn't a bad ride and whole lot easier for me to get down that ways to meet the BF at his work while I don't drive. Given, I'm probably not going to need it in a few months when I have a license, but I'm also thinking about my visiting friends and family. Don't have to pick their ass up- they can ride their on the bus up to my house now. HAHAHA 

One bit of sadness though- 

TWO WORDS: DESIGNATED DRIVER. 

If you live in Centennial Hills and planning to go to the clubs and get smashed, just riding this back home would be a good idea, but I think the last bus is 12am and doesn't start until 6-7am for work commutes. It was about 38 minutes from the transit center to TI and stops about every hour so would be convenient and just as fast as a car ride. It'll probably take a $60 cab to get up here when a C-Line one way ticket is $2 for locals and I think $3 for non. The short walk can be sobering or you can puke al fresco. RTC, tap into this. 

Otherwise, I'm happy there's a convenient bus for tourist friends who complain I live too far. No excuses now! Wooot! For that simple fact, they deserve the ""I'm a fan"" rating though I think it's just a A-OK service. 3.5 stars I suppose would be the most accurate (Yelp put a broader point system in!). rating of the new C-Line.",2010-05-30 05:25:15

Granted, if I were in more comfortable shoes and did not have a screaming headache and mild asthma attack from the abundance of cigars around me, the stairs wouldn't have made a big deal. However, they do not do anything for the ambiance, especially for those unlucky individuals who have to go UP the stairs. 

My group (which did include a guy) did not have any trouble getting in. I had us guestlisted at the last minute and we were in the club within ten minutes. I will say that the security inside the club were possibly the nicest I've seen for a while. I haven't heard so many sentences with an exclamation at the end (unless they contained expletives or threats of bodily harm) in a club in a long time. We all received drink tickets which more than came in handy for our group. We opted to stay in the main room after hearing the other two rooms required stairs (little did we know we would be using those stairs later on). 

My friends and I voted and the general opinion was that the stairs should knock off two stars; however, the good time we had definitely earns back one. The club is really nice even though yes, the layout is VERY weird. I would come back!

P.S. I thought I should add that while the stairs look like those slightly creepy back stairwells, half of them are fairly wide which helps with the traffic flow and there are security guards at almost every level just in case.",2011-03-01 09:31:36

I can't even enjoy it. Also, instead of wrapping it in foil which just isolates the heat and makes it hard real easily, they should get net cages so that way if it drops, it wont go every where and it won't get so harsh.

I normally do not like curry at all, so if a dish has any I generally do not care for it (not that it isnt good, I just won't like it) this chicken was tender, and I actually asked for a couple pieces of it, very unique taste and also highly recommended, the chicken was bone in, super tender, and cooked perfectly.

I'm not going to comment on prices since it's kind of telling with the location and all, but it's not a place I would afford to go to often.

The place houses a prominent bar, which was where all the people were at. We were early, the only ones sitting at a table. The windows were open which let in a lot of light, which was nice because the decor is 95% black. 

When the complementary bread came out, the bread and butter was cold. The butter seemed like it just thawed from being in a freezer. Cold bread is never, ever appetizing. This was incredibly disappointing because I have had GREAT breads at franchised restaurants, even. 

We had two appetizers: calamari and fried zucchini. The calamari was OK. The breading was so light it was almost unnoticeable. I did like how fresh the squid tasted. The zucchini was like getting a plate of sauteed zucchini. Breading was falling off and it looked extremely soggy. Also, we noticed the plate looked full because of fried battered pieces, not zucchini.

My boyfriend ordered the bass, oreganata (sp?) style, which was under pasta in a lemon butter sauce. His dish looked good but he couldn't finish it because it was a bit greasy and heavy for him. 

I had the cannelloni florentine, which was supposed to have veal and chicken inside it. The crepes were good (lol). The mixture inside looked like shredded, overprocessed.. something. The meat had a creamy texture, which is just weird. It was overloaded with cheese and cream sauce. I didn't enjoy it. 

Also, despite it being not busy, our waiter was rushed with us. Not sure why. When it started to get more crowded, he spent more time with people. Don't know if it was us or he decided to step up bc there were more people. 

Overall I might try something that doesn't have a lot of cheese but I don't think I could persuade my bf to come back. I'm not that eager to, either.

In any case, Hudson's is currently Calgary's resto-pub hotspot, with a thriving happy hour and an even more thriving night-out scene on weekends (and possibly during the week) .  The food is typical pub fare, the drinks are priced at a small premium, and the crowd is 20-35, 97% white, and 98% drunk.

They have really good salsas too. If you are going through the drive thru, make sure you request some of their extra salsa- particularly their green one. It is so good. My husband also ask for Anaheim chilis to add some spice to his. He usually goes here for lunch once a week and gets the bowls.

I had the cabo azul which came with all assortments - shrimp taco, lobster and seafood empanada, shrimp-stuffed pepper, and beans and rice.  Also, the house habanero hot sauce is a must.  The shrimp taco was just quality all around.  Basic ingredients, but the shrimp had an unbelievable crunch and the soft taco was perfectly fresh.  The pepper itself was fine but again the shrimp innards were just fantastic - some of the best quality seafood I've had in a while.  The empanada was as good as it sounds.  Fresh seafood in a butter-like skin.  Each dish had its own sauce as well which made the plate colorful and added even more punch and flavor to each bite.

I've recently begun admiring the Something Classic team (the folks behind Halcyon and Something Classic Cafe), but Fern takes it to a new level. Where Halcyon is refined and a bit over-priced, Fern is comfortable, delicious and reasonably priced. I'm not usually one for giving star-breakdowns, but I will since we largely dined on small plates:

Wine (4.5 out of 5) -- Our table of four ordered a bottle of Spanish red, a mixing grape I asked our server to repeat twice and still don't remember the name. (When their website is up, I'll come back and update the review). It was a fiery, delicious red - complex and spicy, which is exactly our taste. And at $30, super well priced.

Three Cheese Plate (5 out of 5) -- Loved it! A smoked goat cheese, brie and cheddar, all local/regionally produced, and served with flatbread crisps that remind me of flats I ate as a child - a perfect accompaniment for the cheese. And that cheddar!? It was really good. I need to learn more about where it came from.

Bruschetta (4.5 out of 5) -- We took David A.'s advice below and gave the bruschetta a try. Out. Of. This. World. I mean, this isn't bruschetta as you've likely ever had it at an Italian restaurant, but it was fresh, chock full of vegetables (heirloom tomato?) and so delicious. I'd have given this 5 stars, but it was maybe one piece too small for our table - we divided two large pieces between the four of us. Really, we should have just gotten two orders - it was that good.

Squash Blossom Hushpuppies (4 out of 5) -- Yum! Really delicious little fried pockets with a butter than definitely worked. Again, because we were sharing across a table of four, I just pined for an extra piece or two so I wouldn't seem so piggish. You get three, and I would have loved 4 or 5.

Indian Tacos (3.5 out of 5) -- I agree with Nicole W. below - these are filling, but they were my least favorite component of the night, though still worthy of 3.5 stars. Spicy and earthy, these tacos are well described - classically Indian flavors and textures. I don't know what I expected - maybe a little lighter or lettuce/tomato based? In any case, my plate was clean when the meal was done, so there ya go.

Service (5 out of 5) -- Our server Susan was great, personable and attentive. She clearly knew her stuff and by the second bottle of wine (yes, we had two) our group was getting a little spirited, and she was great to us. I really appreciate excellent service, and that's what we got. If the food alone wasn't worth the return trip (and it was, believe me), personable staff like her would encourage us to give it another go. 

Fern is a welcomed addition to Charlotte's eatery landscape. Don't think vegetarian is your thing? Give it a try anyway - you'll be glad you did.",2011-11-05 12:34:30

I will start by saying that none of us had a drink. Next time, for sure.

It was a beautiful evening. We sat outside in the lovely patio area and the acoustics were such that we really could not hear any of the other conversations that went on around us. Very nice.
Service was excellent. No long waits for food or the bill. We never felt rushed and our meals all came at the same time.

My partner and I shared two dishes. The waitress offered to split our meals for us which was lovely. We ordered the So-Cal Grain bowl which included a soft-boiled egg. They gave us each a whole egg! Nice touch. We also shared the Tuna Conserva Sandwich. We agreed that the grain bowl was spectacular. Nuts, grains, veggies and a wonderful ""dressing"". Next time I will probably order a a bowl of my own. The sandwich was good, especially the bread.. It had a thick slice of cucumber inside which added a nice crunch. The tuna was made from fresh fish but it still was tuna salad...

Our dining companions, who had been to Everly before, were very happy with their meals, as well. She had the grain bowl too and loved it. He had the Brussel Sprout Salad with a myriad of greens, shaved sprouts, nuts, seeds and melon. What a fabulous combination.

After eating healthy at Everly, we walked to Michael's Frozen Custard where both dads received a small sundae for $1. Mmmm. Then we headed to Wingra Park. We sat on a bench, watched some angler's do their thing and just soaked up the magic of the lake. This is a no-wake park so it is silent and ever so beautiful. A feast for the eyes.

I can't wait to go back to Everly. It will be hard to try something new but I promise to try. I will keep you posted.",2017-06-20 17:08:54

We both started with salads, I had the beet and goat cheese and salad with those great house made candied salted pecans with mixed greens. This salad had the PERFECT play of sweetness and saltiness and was perfectly dressed with a delicious taste. The goat cheese was high quality meaning not tangy. The portion was generous ($8.)

I went with the hanger steak special ($23.). I wasn't sure if the steak would be tender ordering it medium or medium rare but my server informed me that they use high quality grade of steak and it would be tender no matter how I ordered it. At first I was a little bummed that it came with only feta side salad instead of a vegetable and potato like one usually expects, but when I tasted everything I was blown away. Everything was perfect, a perfect sauce, perfect steak and a salad that exceeded my expectations.

My husband went with pasta special ($22) that was made with three different in-house made sausages, sweet, hot, and fennel. He said the taste was phenomenal and we'd have to come here more often. I do note the pasta was slightly over cooked.

I noticed most people were ordering the fish and chips special made with cod. On a past visit I had a similar soup to one I had at Bouchon and honestly Amuse Bouche soup was better. I was too full for dessert this time but the pots de creme here is exceptional.

The only downside I see here is the very limited daily changing menu, and you might have to go out of your comfort zone and order something you might not usually get. The only dinner that seems to be regular on the menu is the bacon wrapped meatloaf  ($15)

I've been here several times for dinner, it's always good to exceptional for dinner. You have to make a reservation because this place is tiny and you have to bring your own booze they charge $3 a glass fee.

Their second floor was reserved, so we ate on the first floor ramen. Overall, it was an OK experience. The service there wasn't very good. Ordered a green tea and an extra bowl that never came. 

In terms of their ramen, it isn't fair for me to review as I'm not a fan of the food. I like yakitori better. In terms of the yakitori, the portions were about the same as some of the other locations that I have tried, but it wasn't as good. I found that it wasn't to my liking. 

Pros:

Has Yakitori
Their Wagu beef yakitori was fantastic
The family loved the ramen (don't add the seaweed. The taste overwhelmed one of the soup base in one of the bowls). 
Cheese Chicken meatball must eat when hot. then it is good. If the cheese cools, it is terrible.

Cons

Drink and empty bowl didn't arrive
Soup base very oily

Crispy Beef- This was bland and greasy. The sweet sauce on the side was lumpy and way too sweet.
Chicken corn soup- This was served hot and it was tasty
Green beans- Always seems to be a winner, they are delicious.
Hakka chow mein- the taste is good but I found the noodles to be starchy and they were sticking to my teeth
Chicken Pakoras- These were very tasty and cooked just to a nice crispy batter without holding a lot of oil.

The restaurant is nice and upscale, perfect for work functions and date nights. There doesn't seem to be any particular dress code required for the place, as my team went in for lunch with our normal casual clothes. 

Environment:
There are plenty of free parking space available outside for customers, with some restaurant specific parking spaces available. Inside, the restaurant is beautifully renovated and very classy, great for formal events. The restaurant is pretty big and can definitely accommodate large groups and buy-out for corporate events. We went in a group of 20 and we were seated comfortably in 2 tables. 

Food:
Overall the food was pretty good. Since I went with my work team I didn't get to take pictures of everything, but the steak I got was awesome. They offer a select variety of steaks for lunch, and I ordered the 14oz rib eye steak ($42), medium rare, with baked potato on the side. I'm delighted to see the steak actually came out medium rare, while many other restaurants tend to overdo it. I think my favourite part of the dish was the baked potato though. I got it with butter and bacon bites and it tasted phenomenal and I devoured it within seconds. The dish also came with some fried onion strips and it was pretty good as well, however I wish it came with some complementary salads or veggies so not everything was so greasy (you could choose veggies as your side). 

Service:
You know the place is fancy when the waitresses are all dressed up in tight dresses and high heels. My team was under-dressed compared to them lol. The servers were very professional and patient with our large group. They would periodically come over to check up on us and clear empty dishes.

Bland to say the least, the hot links were good no issues with that , yams were basic nothing to go back for more. As far the ribs, they were very little, and we did wish they were cooked more, we  love a nice charred taste on the outside. Next we had the pulled pork sandwich, pork was great but def needed cole slaw, which it doesn't come with, but they were all out to order a side of it.

I ordered fried chicken and fries.  At first I was really disappointed because the chicken came naked, no breading or seasoning.  Management was great though, when I went back in to explain this is not what I had in mind he offered to refund, I opted to try something else so I ordered hot wings.  Really, really good!  Wasn't in the mood for them but they were some of the best hot wings I've had in a very long time.  The sauce was perfectly flavored, (not over the top hot but definitely had some kick) chicken crispy and juicy.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because their was a major communication problem when I placed my order (could have been language barrier).  But still very frustrating.  Everyone their was friendly and food was fresh and tasted good, I'll definitely be back.

It's on the corner of nothing. It should be in the circle with other popular restaurants. The seating is lacking something but I'm not sure what. The folks there seemed to try really hard but for the money I would suggest the Palm. At least at the Palm they sorta get it. This place is very expensive but they don't seem to understand the concept. The food had some bright spots. The Palm at one time had some great fried onions. They dropped them. If you go to Oak start with a burger & onions. Don't drop $100.00 per person until they prove worthy. You better hurry. I doubt they will last until the lease is up or a good recession hits. By all means try it. The wine menu is a menagerie. Good luck with navigating your way through it.Maybe the guy who owns Mid-wood BBQ will buy the place.

We ordered:
Orzo and duck (the flavors in this dish are so rich I can't begin to describe them)

Go in for lunch on a weekend and you'll find numerous golfers cooling off after a round on the links and on Friday nights during high school football season you'll see families getting a bite before Brophy Games at the Phoenix College stadium.

The burgers are big and juicy and with the condiment bar you can add whatever toppings you like. The french fries are thick and seasoned well. My wife loves the ham steak sandwich and the kids like the choice of hamburgers, hot dogs or chicken fingers.

The decor is like an old-fashioned tavern with gas station and other kitschy decorations overlooking wood benches and tables. The TV's usually have ESPN or some sporting events on and you can also sit at the bar or on the patio when the weather permits.

As a whole, the restaurant is very reminiscent of the Chuck Box in Tempe and the Monastery that used to be at 28th and Indian School. A great casual atmosphere to get eats and drinks without the pretension found at some of the new upscale burger joints in town.

ePWPaNwRRmjJFdzn71i9Pw,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,5XZgjdttahrvS5JoXVZ4Kg,4,0,0,0,"My final stop for this year's MTL a Table event was to BarBounya, a restaurant I have had on my list for a while now. After having read so many great articles and reviews about it and its sister restaurant Su in Verdun, I figured if I was ever going to give turkish food a shot, Chef Fisun Ercan and her team were probably the place to really do it.

Compared to the more formal Su, BarBounya described itself as a Turkish tapas bar. The look of the room fits with that description. Most of the seating is along bars that go around the space. There are a few communal style tables as well. The style is a mixture of old and new where the old elements of a townhouse on the Plateau are blended with some more modern touches of lighting and decor. Your eyes naturally fixate on the beautiful bar along the side wall with the high cabinets behind it - housing the wine - as well as the open window into the kitchen where you can see the kitchen staff work their magic.  

BarBounya did their MTL √† Table menu a little different in that we were served all the items in the tapas style of the restaurant - the dishes simply portioned according to the size of your dinner party. I was not aware of that going in but frankly, everything on the menu sounded good so at least it eliminated any debating amongst the four of us in what we were going to order.

First service brought forth three items. First was kale tempura served with a spicy tomato sauce and some yogourt. I never thought I would enjoy a dish whose primary ingredient was kale but here we are. The tempura actually stuck to the leaves and created a crunchy exterior. The kale itself didn't wilt and kept some tenderness within the tempura coating. The spicy tomato sauce and the creamy cool yogourt provided some nice contrasting dipping sauces to use in conjunction.

Next was a salad of beets and chickpeas served with black garlic yogourt. Another big hit at the table - the freshness of the beets was a nice pairing with the crisp chickpeas and the subtle hit of garlic within the creamy yogourt. Another dish where the main ingredient is not an usual favourite of mine but it certainly gave me a further appreciation of beets.

Final dish of the first course was grilled octopus carpaccio. Outside of the contradiction between grilled octopus and carpaccio - yes I know people use carpaccio to refer to any preparation of meat thinly cut but to me, carpaccio means raw - this dish was delicious. The octopus was beautifully tender and fresh and a nice mixture of oil and greens to enhance its natural flavour.

The second course provided another three dishes to enjoy. The surprise hit was the barley salad with butternut squash, sun-dried tomatoes and nuts. A very hearty salad with the sweetness of the squash and the tomatoes working well with the earthy barley.

The grilled lamb K√∂fte with tomato salsa was exactly as I would expect - spiced lamb meatballs grilled beautifully. The tomato salsa provided a little freshness to the festivities.

The final dish was pulled pork served over an eggplant puree. The pulled pork was flavourful and tender but truthfully the star was that puree. Wonderfully smooth and creamy - the natural flavour of the eggplant came through so well without being overwhelming to the pork served over top of it. First thing my girlfriend said afterwards was that she wanted to try making it after we had it - the impact was that strong.

To finish things off nicely for dessert, we got some chocolate baklava and almond pudding. The baklavas were not overly sweet thankfully with a nice touch of chocolate mixed in. The pudding was creamy and smooth. The addition of the pistachio and pomegranate crumble over the top added some nice extra flavours. A pleasant sweet touch to end a wonderful meal.

BarBounya was a awesome experience from beginning to end. Every dish was enjoyed and devoured by myself and the rest of the group. Such a great usage of fresh ingredients all across the entire meal. Add to that some nice glasses of wine, a nice atmosphere indoors and nicely attentive service - props to our waitress for checking with my pregnant friend about the lamb - and you have a restaurant that definitely come back to much sooner than it took me to visit in the first place... and I suppose its sister Su is now higher up on my to-visit list now.

We came here over Father's Day Sunday, so it was very busy. Being that it was just my husband and myself, we didn't have to wait very long to get seated at all. I have a feeling that it's always pretty busy- the kind of food they serve appeals very much to the suburban crowd of North Phoenix.  

I'm not sure where they used to be, but this is their new location. It's really nice, done in the style of modern lodge I guess. Lots of wood, but a bit sleeker. They have a full bar, so we were able to have beer and mimosas with our lunch, which I certainly appreciated! 

The menu is solid, good and filling. Most anything you'd find at a Denny's you'd find here. I built my own omelette- an egg white omelette with peppers, spinach and chorizo. This was a winner- I've never had the option to add chorizo, and the spices in it made the omelette truly outstanding. They also have these giant, fluffy home made biscuits that are pretty awesome. It always comes with big dipping bowls of creamy gravy to dip into. It's a bit runnier than I'm used to with gravy, but it still tasted pretty wonderful.

My rating is probably more of a 3.5. I stopped in around noon on a Thursday. The bar was fairly empty. Was greeted by the bartender and given a menu. She explained a few of the options, and got me my Iced Tea.

Menu has lots of choices, I went with the two meat meal, sliced brisket and ribs with a side of smoked pork belly baked beans. Unfortunately the beans weren't ready, so they subbed in some mashed potatoes. A container full of napkins, to go plastic sauce cups, plastic silverware, and their 3 sauces was dropped off and I was ready to chow down.

They are famous for their God sauce, which is pretty tasty, a little sweet and smoky. When my food came out, the brisket, the ribs, and even the potatoes had God sauce on them. I think this is why I rated them lower than some, by the time I finished the taste of God sauce permeated my taste buds. 

The sliced brisket was nice and tender. The bottom part still had a huge portion of fat on it....I think you should trim this before serving. The ribs were really good with that smoked flavor and moist as well. Both were pretty tasty on their own.

I was devastated when the old Top Notch BBQ food truck got repossessed out from under pitmaster Jimmy Cole. Where else was I going to get my beloved #CincyPorkWich, a towering sandwich of tender, smoky pulled pork smothered in rich, sweet Cincinnati chili?

Well, this month Jimmy and Val finally opened a brick-and-mortar version of their beloved Top Notch truck in a killer location at Eastern & Serene, just off the 215 in the Doc Holliday's restaurant space previously occupied by Monstah Lobstah.

I'm pleased to report that those familiar flavors are back and you can once again taste the well-deserved winner of the Las Vegas Weekly's nod as best BBQ in town.

I'm more than a little obsessed with the Cincy chili here, partly because you can only get it in one other place in Vegas (and they make it way too sweet). So my favorite sandwiches here are the ones smothered in it. The first is the aforementioned #CincyPorkWich, referred to on the menu unobtrusively as the ""pulled pork sandwich."" You can also get it with cole slaw instead of the chili, which is always a good option.

Another standout sandwich is the beef hot link, with genuine heat and a nice snap to it. It's served in a soft sesame seed bun, covered in just enough chili and melted cheddar to create a gestalt of savory goodness without rendering the sandwich a sloppy mess.

As for the sides, the beans are among the best I've ever had, and the sweet potato casserole is a standout as well.

In a desperate and futile attempt to battle the body image issues that come with being a single man living in Las Vegas, I try to restrict my diet with a ""no pork during pool season"" edict.

This is the first genuine antique store I have been too and...wow! this place is huge! 

The main store has a full basement underneath the first floor and both are filled wall to wall with 100s of displays. There is also an annex to the west of the main store which has an over flow of items. Both of the buildings are run down. The main store reminds me of a large dance hall, it has a big, open staircase leading down to the basement just to the left of the front door. From the basement there are two staircases going back up to the first floor, one on the east side and the other on the west side of the building. Both buildings were well light and the pathways (I say pathways, not aisles for a reason) were clean and easy to walk through. 

Along with my friend, I brought my two puppies and they had no problem letting me walk around with my animals - animal friendly is always a plus!! Both stores were a bit disorganized and my OCD sensors were on overdrive, but I think most of the merchandise is still owed by individuals...so all their stuff is in the same booth area. I'm sure Antique Plaza gets a percentage of the sales. Oh and I would like to mention that Antique Plaza was like the only store open on Labor Day (which was when I visited the stores). 

Walking through the different booths and looking at some of the pieces brought back memories of my childhood, events, good times and at times I had moments of awe for some unique beauties that were displayed. 

I didn't find what I was looking for, but I had a really fun time exploring what some call treasures and some call junk...check it out if you are in the neighborhood, who knows? You may find something you haven't thought about in a really long time.

When I asked the girl working if I could get it without the duck, she looked at me like I had three heads and said he probably would not do that.  He was right behind her so she asked.  He too looked at me like I had three heads.  All I wanted was the brussel sprouts.  I was not asking them to somehow bring the duck that had died to make that taco back to life.  Eventually they got it and made it.  It was just okay.  Nothing special and not as tasty as I dreamed.  

In a nutshell, I was just not blown away at all.  Maybe I have to go back, but with Yo Rita maintaining my taco love, and D's Packs and Dogs holding my hot dog love, it will probably have to be quite awhile.  Worth checking out though if you are in the neighborhood and want to try something different.",2012-12-15 02:11:18

TJ Thompson was very helpful when selecting my furniture items and really seemed to go above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. He took personal interest in our needs and even made sure we got the best price. 

Cheapell Jones was another helpful associate in electronics and appliances. He was very friendly and easy going. He helped us choose the perfect TV, washer and dryer for our new home.

Both of these sales reps were not pushy, only eager to please.

The price was $50.13 per person and they had a special menu where you could pick between a couple different things. We started out with a large loaf of onion bread. The bread wasn't bad but I could only eat so much. Next came the French onion soup. I could have picked up and drank it in 3 gulps it was so small. The soup had a very bland flavor. Then my steak and sides came. The filet was cooked the way I asked and didn't taste bad but certainly isn't worth what they are charging. I have had better steak at high end steakhouses on the strip. The sides I shared with my wife, we had the sour cream mashed potatoes and lyonnaise potatoes. The mashed was not bad but the lyonnaise potaotes were just gross. The onions were very overcooked and chewy. The potatoes weren't at all what my wife showed me in other pictures on yelp. Then came dessert. I chose the strawberry cheesecake and it couldn't have been anymore flavorless. The portions for restaurant week were way smaller then if you just came in and ordered from their regular menu which is a scam to me. The food just wasn't good and a waste of money.

Our server was very good. He checked on us often. One of the servers mentioned that Morton's was undergoing a remodel and said we were lucky to be seated in a booth in the corner because then we wouldn't be bothered by dust like some other customers. You should never ever talk about that with people about to eat in your restaurant.  

The parking sucks. The front of the restaurant is reserved for valet only. All other patrons must park behind the restaurant and walk around. Not very classy.",2013-09-10 22:44:35

Now newly renovated, the aesthetic and vibe has changed so much in recent years, This location in particular is  the older one out of the two, but it still holds up pretty well. 

I've only dined in a couple of times, and it's not amazing, I honestly much rather prefer takeout from this location. 

I some of my usual go-to dishes are: 

Veggie Hakka Noodles - The noodles are always thick and cooked so well. Never soggy or limp. 

Chili Chicken with Gravy  - a staple! it has a lot of green chillies 

Manchurian Chicken with Gravy - Tossed in a Red Manchurian Sauce, it has a great taste and its not too spicy!

Chilli Paneer: It's honestly a great alternative if you're a vegetarian.

Veggie Fried Rice - it's honestly just as good as the Chicken Fried Rice, (they just substitute the chicken with Broccoli ) so if you have vegetarian with you, definitely get this to share!

Chicken Corn Soup - A Hakka Staple! It's a pretty mild soup with exactly as its described; chicken and corn.

The portions are always generous, and the price point is pretty great.",2018-03-19 16:49:57

It's small and homey but definitely a delicious place. My four-person meal came out to $33 overall (tax + tip), which is a pretty good deal for their delicious food. 

We ordered the beef brisket soup noodles, the ja jiang noodles, and the lamb soup noodles. The lamb was by far the best - the broth was flavourful and there was a good amount of meat provided. We also ordered the pan-fried beef bun, which was okay but it's not high on my list. Their red bean cake was amazing though, and I'd say you need to get that if you come here. A good amount of red bean and totally worth its price. 

Overall the place is really fun (I always enjoy watching the chefs at work creating noodles) so it's yummy and entertaining at the same time. If you're in the area, it's worth a stop by.

We arrived right around noon on a Saturday and were told it would be a twenty minute wait for a table for two. Fast forward to an hour later. My fianc√© and I were getting very hungry and went to the counter to ask about the status of our table. We stood there for a while without being acknowledged. A group of guys went up to the counter and asked about the status of their table for six. The man at the counter said there were a few people before them. Then someone from the group of guys came to the front and started speaking Egyptian to the man at the counter and were seated right away. I was put off by the whole experience, but I wasn't going to leave now, since I've already been waiting for over an hour. 

The two servers who took care of us were very sweet. The guy apologized for the long wait for our table and the girl made us feel very welcomed and was excited that it was our first visit to Mahas. We ordered the honey and cardamom latte, beet salad, Cairo classic, and a falafel dish. The latte came shortly after we ordered it and it was one of the best lattes I have ever had. The milk foam was so thick and flavoured perfectly. As someone who makes lattes regularly, I was impressed. The food took longer than anticipated, but it was well worth the wait. The feta that came with the Cairo classic takes a year to make and it was so good. The falafel dish was amazing. Two soft boiled eggs inside of the most fresh falafel we've ever had. I really enjoyed the salad that came with our meals, too. The perfect mix of fresh and tangy. I kind of felt that the portion of the falafel dish was kind of small for what I paid, but the flavour more than makes up for it. The beet salad was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The table we got was also tiny. It could barely fit our two plates, let alone the water glasses. While my fianc√© was trying to get a fork full of food, the plate fell into his lap because the lip was hanging off the table. Being a server, I was kind of irked that nobody offered him extra napkins to clean up the mess on his pants. 

A star was taken off for the guy at the counter letting people go ahead of us. Because of that, we got seated at the same time as people who came half an hour after us. Their way of seating guests seems a little... biased.",2015-05-17 05:20:12

They changed some of their plates so they are no longer the cheap plastic ones your mom only uses to cut vegetables. However, their bowls are still the cheap plastic ones... The ones with a cartoon bear picture with some lame English phrase like ""forever friends love"". And what's even worse is that the colours have already faded, and the bottom of the bowl is grainy from wear and tear. 

The cups they used to serve tea was so old it was foggy. Nuff said. 

These plastic bowls are not meant to serve hot food, like the soup I was served because it came with my meal. The colours are probably toxic, or at least unsafe, for human consumption. You use these bowls for cold food like cereal? Ok. But not hot food! 

The shanghai noodles I ordered were super oily. After I took one bite, I felt very greasy. My mouth was coated in 3"" of oil. Yuck. Ages ago, this place would fry their udon crispy and I'd recommend it to everyone. If you don't like gallons of oil, stay away from here.

The hosts and hostesses were very friendly and our waitress was wonderful.  Our glasses were never lower than half full, the food came out hot and empty plates were taken away quickly.

The entire meal was great and everything we tried was full of flavor.  To begin the evening we ordered salsa and chips.  There are five salsas on the menu (as well as four varieties of guacamole) and we decided to share the tomatillo salsa before dinner.  Fresh and delicious.  The portion was relatively small when compared to many Mexican restaurants, but not too small.  We still had some left over to enjoy with our main courses.  The best part of this was we weren't tempted to eat too many chips.  They seem interested in ensuring you leave enough room to enjoy everything else you order, and there's no reason not to select a variety of choices from across the menu to share with your party.

The tacos came in fours and we shared two different styles: Pastor and Carne.  The Carne were perfectly prepared and the pieces of skirt steak were just the right size so that you could enjoy steak with every bite and topped with a variety of greens.  The pastor was just as good, slightly spicy and topped with grilled, diced pineapple and a chili salsa.  Both were fantastic.  We each also ordered a side of Elite Mexicano.  This side comes with two ears of corn.  Next time we'll order one to share and another side for additional variety.

For desert we shared Torrejas de Bolillo--essentially a Mexican bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle.  Just like everything else we tasted, this dish was full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  A great end to a great meal!

I'm a size 14, which in bridal is more like a 20, and the first David's had very few dresses for me to try on. Of the 3 or 4 dresses I tried on only one was even remotely cute. I was frustrated because I had seen several dresses on David's online that I wanted to try but they didn't have them in store. 

Fast forward to last Friday night...I'm perusing online and see a dress I really love. I decided to call the David's Collections store in Scottsdale directly to see if they had it. The receptionist was incredibly helpful. While they didn't have that particular dress she took the time to literally go count the number of dresses in my size and came back on the line saying they had about 10 in my size and more that they could clip me into.

We started our brunch by sharing the ultimate sticky bun, pecans, icing($5), which was large enough to share a few bites between 4 people.   We loved it.

For my main course, I ordered the fried green tomato benedict, biscuit, tomato jam, creole hollandaise, frisee salad ($13).  The creole hollandaise sauce was not too spicy.  It was definately a favorite at the table! 

My son ordered the SR bread pudding french toast, banana caramel bourbon sauce ($11).  Yes, they turned the bread pudding into french toast -- genious! (I'm going to try this out at home.)  Ding. Ding.  Winner.

Our friend ordered the shrimp and grits ($13).  She thought it was delicious, but it was very greasy (as in the oil was pooling to the side of the grits.   

I ordered a Bloody Mary, which I promptly gave to my husband.  I think it must be made with ""creole"" spices and I much prefer a more simpler version with my horse-radish.

Definately consider Southern Rail for an early morning lunch -- it's realtively quite and the menu interesting.

I love the architectural space and decore of Southern Rail -- very open, airy, urban, with lots of outdoor bar and patio space for us to enjoy the good weather we have in Phoenix.

The world-class DJs booked here on a weekly basis are nothing short of mind-boggling, and the Funktion One sound system is an absolute monster. Add to that customized LED displays behind the DJ booth, cryo, confetti and foam and the dancefloor becomes one of the most intense spots in the world to dance your ass off.

The moment that the headlining DJ at Marquee takes the stage every night is made to feel like an even,t, and the energy on the dancefloor is nothing short of incredible. I used to complain that nobody in Vegas danced at nightclubs. Not anymore.

The rooftop pool deck is one of my favorite off-dancefloor haunts, the sound system is fairly impressive for an outdoor setup (but still conversation-friendly) and the bars outside tend to be quicker than in.

The Library is a cool space as well, a genuine library setting with an intriguing collection of books, all vaguely Vegas-related, or sin-related, or somehow relevant in a six-degrees sort of way. The cocktail servers upstairs, it should be noted, dress like sexy librarians. I'm just sayin'. If that's your thing.

The crowd is a blend of mixed motivations - househeads hypnotized by every crossfade, bottle rats who'll be carrying their shoes halfway through the night, VIPs staking out prime real estate - but one thing's for sure, this crowd comes to party.

A few of the little touches that impress me about this place are the subversive Marquis de Sade and Oscar Wilde quotes painted on the walls and mirrors, the stiff drinks (expensive, of course, but strong all the time), and a thoughtful nod to music lovers, the fact that the main room sound system is piped into the bathrooms, hallways and anterooms so it doesn't feel like you're leaving the party every time you need to use the bathroom.

The club stops being fun when it hits capacity though, when bouncers have to block off the dance floor. It's even less fun outside the club at capacity, so get here early or buy presale tickets.

I went here couple of times and still did not like it. 

I decided to try their Tsukemen (soup on the side). Price is reasonable $10.70. 

It came with a flat thick yellow noodle. I thought the noodle was hard to chew and tasteless. The brooth was thick which was expected for Tsukemen, but it was way too salty and has a weird after taste (as if it was re-cooked many times). The charsu was okay, it was cold and taste can improved. It did not come with bamboo shoot or mushroom but it did come with boiled egg. 

Service was great, however. It was fast and timely. 
I also had the macaroon ice cream (not pictured). That's the best part of my lunch. I enjoyed it more than my ramen.

No complaints on our food. 
I loved how the place was all windows and it was a really sunny day so it made it really nice inside and you would never know it was 30 degrees outside.

After doing some yelping and looking at menus we decided on The Upton as I had heard a lot about it on Instagram before!
We arrived at about 6:30 pm on Sunday and it was pretty empty, not a whole lot of people there which was nice. The Upton was a cute little restaurant, kind of hipster-y looking, but I liked it! We were seated right away and asked if we wanted bottled or tap water which I thought was fancy haha. We went for tap water.
We were starving and immediately knew what we wanted to order. Unfortunately our server did not recognize us being on the verge of hangry with our culinary decisions made. She talked about like every item on the menu. Blah blah blah. Like I don't mind if you want to tell us a little bit about the specials but she went on and on and on and we were going nuts. She was sweet though! 
I got the Uptown girl to drink, and the veggie sandwich with a side of French fries to eat. Was surprised by how expensive everything was! The drink was very small and almost all ice, which sucks for a $12 cocktail. I did enjoy it though. Loved my food as well, but that was a tiny sandwich for $11 to not come with any sides. The french fries were absolutely delightful. Veggies on the sandwich were very fresh and tasty as well, loved the goat cheese on the naan bread. My friend was quite disappointed with his meal which made me sad, his last Scottsdale restaurant experience wasn't a good one. He thought the steak was sub par, said he could have made a better one for cheaper! Also his shoestring potatoes weren't very good. I tried them and didn't like them either.
My experience at the Upton wasn't the greatest, but there were some perks to it, food was good and restaurant was cute! But I could have definitely gotten an equally fresh and tasty meal for a significantly lower price somewhere else.",2015-04-21 03:55:29

The restaurant is small in scale, just like most ramen locations downtown. It's also convenient and near the subway station. The interior is actually quite cool too as they have a big japanese statue in the middle.

I got greedy and wanted to try multiple things at Raijin, so I ordered the dessert combo for $14.50 which includes a bowl of ramen, salad, drink, and dessert.

The salad came with ham bits, corn, and lettuce. It gave it a crunchy texture. I thought the salad dressing (not sure what it was) was tasty and refreshing.

For the ramen, I chose the Tonkotsu Shoyu pork ramen. The noodles was a bit different than the normal ramen I've had. It's more chewy with a rougher texture. The pork wasn't totally pork belly either but the meat was still very soft. On the side, there was one slice of seaweed and half an egg. The egg was not bad but not the best yolk-y type. However, I liked the soup base - it was savory and just right, not too salty even if I drank it alone.

Got a decent sized glass of Nestea for the drink. I believe you can choose between pop and tea.

Lastly.. DESSERT! The dessert was delicious! My choice was a cheesecake with raspberry sauce. It tasted much like tofu cheesecake with its super soft texture which totally melts in your mouth. However, interestingly enough, the top and bottom of the cake crust was still solid. Great for a cheesecake with that standard!",2015-03-24 16:39:17

They run out fast. NO LIE. Call ahead and they will set aside what they have available for you. I mentioned on my last visit that I always miss the cinnamon rolls now and found out that you can pre-order online.

There was a total of 7 banchan (side dishes) and my favourite was the potato cubes in a crispy sugary coat. It's a little sweeter than most other Korean restaurants but I have a big sweet tooth so it suited me well. I just wish the potatoes were a little warmer. I found the glass noodles absolutely tasteless so I would rate that as the worst of the side dishes. 
I wasn't feeling overly adventurous so I stuck with my pork bone soup. I think I got up to 4 pieces of pork bone so there was plenty of meat! Meat was quite tender and I could only finish half of my pork bone soup before surrendering it to my boyfriend. He got J3 (seasoned marinated sirloin beef served with soybean (or soft tofu) soup. I personally didn't find his sirloin beef appealing so I opted out when he offered me some. I did try some of his soybean soup near the end of our meals and it was really yummy! A little salty but that's what made it taste so goooood. Will definitely come back for their pork bone soup and maybe try something else on their menu, which is pretty extensive.

Ambiance: 3.5 stars
Nice simple Korean restaurant. I like how they have these little black seat pads so your butt doesn't hurt from the wooden booths.

My friend and I came in on a Saturday around 5pm and we waited about 20minutes. We sat in a small waiting that only had a futon looking couch to sit on and was not comfortable. I felt like I was going to fall through sitting down! 

They called us both in and we walked right into the first room to our left which was next to the waiting area we were sitting at. The room was dim and the room had calming music playing. There were 3 bed light seating areas for us to lay down at and my friend and I were next to each other. The a/c was on full blast I thought it was kinda chilly but we figured maybe when they start the massage we wouldn't notice. We did not have to remove out clothes which is what I rather prefer. They brought a bucket of warm water for us to start off with to soak our feet in. The water went cold quick so wish it was a little hotter when they brought it out. 

We laid down on our backs while our feet is still soaking. The massage starts from eye level up so yes they massage your temple, forehead, head and parts of your face so if you don't like someone touching your face you may want to mention that. Then they turn you to the right then left to get to the shoulder area. They took the buckets of water away and wiped down out feet to start the massage. Which I think I fell asleep 3x during this part. Oh and they did put a face towel over our eyes the entire time they do the massage. The last part was we turn over and they massage our backs. Now this part woke me up! She definitely worked my back out. Her elbows were dug right in. They massage from your back all the way down to your calves. I wasn't sure if I was feeling good or not because it felt painful at times. Yeah yeah I know I should of asked her to go lighter but I figured maybe this will help my tense muscles relax. All I know by the end I was sore. 

I think they should at least ask if it was too strong during parts of the massage. I'm saying this because the ones in Cali that I go to would stop and ask that. And the walls were very thin because during this whole massage we can hear everything in the waiting room including the phone conversation the receptionist had!",2016-08-29 05:05:14

First up....they finally got their LIQUOR LICENSE!!! Woohoo...now you can enjoy a frosty beer or a nice sake with your meal. I guess they got it about 8 months ago.

I went with my friend on a Tuesday night around 7:30 pm. We were promptly greeted and told it would be a minute or two until seated, which was accurate. We were seated next to a group of newbies. My friend had never been to shabu shabu, so I placed our orders. The waiter took his time to describe the meal and help the group next to us cook, which helped my friend. Excellent service!

Unfortunately they had just run out of Kurobota pork which I was planning on getting, so I just went with the Yojie cut. I did not notice any reduction in the quality of the meat. Normally I always get the combo, but I wasn't super hungry and just went with the smaller portion which was just the right amount. My friend loved her food, and finished it all and proclaimed she was stuffed!! So no dessert, which the group next to us did order and the fruit with chocolate fondue looked so gooooooooood I wanted some.

Their chunky salsa is good enough to drink. Also tried their tamales done Christmas style of course. And they stand the test against right up against my other favorite New Mexican in the Valley.

Tried the mix and match because I just like bespoke. So the base mix and match is $14. I added salmon, green papaya, edamame, pokito shoyu, pineapple chow, tamago, mandarin orange, nori, avocado wasabi sauce, taro chips, crispy onion, tobiko, and tuna for $2 extra. Total $16 before tax. It was a huge portion though. Lots of tuna and salmon.

Here's what you need to know: 
- The food is amazing.   I had the rock shrimp and the sushi dinner.   Every bite was amazing.   The sushi was super fresh and the inventive little touches of sauce, herb, etc. were bright and flavorful.  The rock shrimp were perfectly done with just a touch of spice.   The ginger dressing was awesome and even the soup seemed a little superior.   
- The service is amazing.  Darryl was delightful.  Attentive, friendly, professional, and informative.  He took his time explaining the menu and making recommendations.  At the end of the meal, he refilled water glasses without a word while we lingered just a bit (it wasn't busy).   
- The atmosphere is amazing.  It has an authentic feel and with nice accents and dim lighting to set the mood.  
- The prices are INSANE.  Picture a ""normal"" sushi restaurant, then cut the portions in half and double the prices - that's basically what you have here.  The food was fantastic, don't get me wrong, but I disagree with the reviews that say it's worth the money.   It's just not.   Nigiri is $5-$8 per piece (very small pieces - easily one bite).  Maki goes all the way up to $27 for a rainbow roll or dragon roll, which are both pretty small for that price tag.  Entrees are also small portions and only a handful of them come with the soup and salad to round out the meal.  The omakase tasting menus range from $90-$130 per person.  Overall, expect to spend 3-4 times the amount that you'd normally spend on a good sushi dinner that won't leave you wanting a snack on the way home.  I just can't justify it.     
- They offer valet parking in the lot, but then it's a trek up two long flights of stairs - not for the elderly or injured, for sure.

Now, chains always seem to get an awful rep over the little guys but this time round I was quite pleased.

We came in for brunch this past Sunday and I ordered my standard measure for breakfast: eggs, sausage, toast and has browns with coffee.  It was a pleasant surprise to me that it came with a maple turkey sausage!  I could have ate much more of those.

Instead, the same sandwiches that made this place famous on the 
Food Network continue to pace growth. 

What I like about this location is it stays open late even when most of the other area restaurants have been closed for hours. And, while most of the people here after 10pm are drinking in the bar the kitchen remains open late for those looking for a bite, like me. And, you can't beat their incredible happy hour prices. Or, the TVs that litterer the inside so we can watch sporting events. 

I still haven't embraced their pizzas, or the wings, but continue to chow down on the sandwiches (sorry, I'm never trying the sardine and cheese though!). There's an endless amount of meats available and definitely something for everyone although I'm partial to the turkey, corned beef, pastrami, sweet sausage and the cheese.

I frequent this one anyway because it's located right by the freeway and they always get my drink right!

Like most locations, the drive-thru line stays pretty constant at around four cars deep when it's slow. But even when it wraps around the building, I find that the line here always moves quicker than other Starbucks in the area.

The parking lot can be a real pain in the neck during peak hours due to cars pouring in through all entrances, people trying to enter the drive-thru lane from multiple directions, and cars attempting to exit onto the busy street with no discernible sense of urgency.

The Camaron (shrimp) taco is slathered in what they call ""Chipotle Mojo"" sauce which is an orange-colored, Sunday sauce-like (but Mexican) curry-like concoction. It also makes an appearance on their nacho plates. The repurposing of this sauce on multiple menu items is questionable, and something about the look of it is a little off-putting. On the shrimp taco it completely shrouds the ingredients in an opaque orange layer. Close your eyes and it tastes alright, but the overall visual is somewhat IKEA-cafeteria-like. All tacos are served on skinny, rectangular plates, so aim your taco droppings well or you'll be saying ""Chipotle Uh-oh"" on yer pants.

The nachos have potential - served on a hot metal vessel atop a wooden plank. But I wish the nachos were made with 3X more warm hockey-game queso, like the famed Isla Nachos of pre-2013 Treasure Island days... Nacho Daddy is the closest you'll find these days.

Mercadito's Habanero salsa and other salsas on the side will be charged for to the tune of $3.50+, so heat-seekers be warned. The Habanero salsa itself lacks punch - probably the weakest Habanero heat I've experienced since the Habanero salsa craze started. Absolutely no comparison to the *free* secret Habanero served at Javier's.

I'm a fan of the Mexican cocktail menu. The 'Misty Sleeve' was hibiscus-y and refreshing. At $10.50 though, it's all the money. A solid, standard Margarita will set you back $8.50. Not terribly pricey, but not five bucks.

Enjoyed the warm 3-corn pico, but was hard to eat in a shallow glass bowl. Keeping the kernels from flying off the edge was challenging.

Currently running a pretty slangin' deal on Tuesdays for 'industry folk': 50% off your check!

Prices are generally above-average for average Mexican fare. This place is trying to compete with the likes of Javier's (at Aria) but lacks the generous portions, go-for-it flavors, and beautiful plating/presentation. If you're gonna charge 5X-6X more than a taco stand, your food needs to please your palate at least 2X more. That's weird going-out-to-eat math, but ni modo!",2014-07-16 17:06:24

Back entrance apparently has its own queue that you could wait for and is shorter wait if it's busy.

They did a pretty good job, even the coleslaw tasted fresh and was not drenched in dressing. Plus it was a good sized meal! I even had a little leftover to eat for breakfast the next morning.

Alas, as I often say, you can't eat ambiance, nor does it fill your drink, so the rating mostly comes down to the food and service. In my view, both were lacking. Our server wasn't terribly friendly, to put it nicely. Sorry to say, but if you have resting bitch face, you could at least try to smile now and then. While I could stomach service without a smile if the service was at least good, in this case it fell short. My drink was empty far too often and for far too long. More than once, refill was promised but never came. That's high on my short list of unforgivable restaurant sins, especially given that the place was half empty at the time.

The food, while good, was nowhere near as good as the hype would lead you to believe. As far as appetizers, the croquets were, in my opinion, dry and lacked flavor. The meatballs had flavor, but not much, and were only lukewarm. When it comes to the entrees, my pasta bolognese was perfectly cooked, but both the pasta and the sauce, again, lacked strong flavor. I've gotten stronger flavor out of a jar of store bought meat sauce and boxed noodles, and that's not an exaggeration. 

Last but definitely not least, I have to mention the flies. I don't know what it was, but there were quite a few flies buzzing around our table and those nearby. It was very unappetizing having them land on our hands, heads, plates and drinks, constantly. Nobody did anything about it, and it went on for the entire meal until we left. Were it not for this, I'd have added a star, but it grossed me out. 

As the rating says, I've experienced better. Much better, and without the flies. I don't recommend it, at least not for pasta dishes and not if you expect service with a smile.",2017-12-21 22:42:25

The PHO is solid here but man my brisket was fatty and that hurt my feelings. 

The service was slow yesterday with only 3 other tables in the restaurant PLUS everyone else had food. My thought: it's just PHO what's the deal? 

I guess they were looking for timing after the dumplings. 
The sauce with the dumplings was not tasty. Brown, hot and flavorless. 

Yet, pork within the dumpling was flavorful with the right amount of heat (spice).

 The yolk of the egg was gooey and had a perfect rich golden tint! The chasiu didn't stand out to me particularly however.

After reading reviews for a few offices, I noticed that most patients are seen by a physicians assistant instead of the doctors themselves so I decided to go with Dr. Fife's office. The next available appointment was two weeks out the time that I needed it, so I scheduled it. Charlene on the phone was really nice and emailed me the forms that way I wouldn't have to fill out any paperwork in the office, she told me I would be seeing PA Brittny. I was also told the visit could cost anywhere from $60-$90, depending on what I would need done, we will see once they bill my insurance. 

One thing I have to point out, the yelp listing address is wrong, Dr. Fife's office is located at 6460 Medical Center Street, Suite 350, Las Vegas, NV 89148, which is located on the 3rd floor of the building. If it weren't for Sandra R.'s tip, I would have gone to their former location. 

The day of my appointment finally came, the office is very modern, looks a little bit cold in comparison to other offices but the staff is really nice. Charlene is the one who greeted me, took my paperwork and insurance cards. Make sure you're well groomed because they take a picture of you. I had rolled out of bed, took a shower, and left for my appointment so they now have a really bad picture of me, haha. My appointment time was set for 8 a.m. there was only one other person in the waiting room with me, Charlene pointed out the waters, juice, and crackers they had for patients waiting, I thought that was a nice touch. 

I was called back to the room within 10 minutes of taking a seat. I was asked some information and was told that Brittny would be with me as soon as she was done with the patient before me. The wait was only 20 minutes before she came in the room. We discussed what was going on with my skin and asked if I preferred oral or topical treatment. +1, I am highly against ingesting pharmaceuticals so I am glad that she gave me the option of choosing. She explained to me in great detail what I needed to do and how the medication worked, she is very friendly, knowledgeable, and competent. I was very happy with my appointment, I was in and out in 40 minutes. Before I left I was given samples of the topical cream that I was prescribed and I was also told I might be able to get it cheaper through a company they use vs. my pharmacist, that's good information to know.

The place was pretty packed for Monday evening, so there was a bit of a line, but they seemed to be pretty organized and the wait wasn't too bad. They have an enormous amount of flavor options for shave ice, as well as smoothies and coffee drinks. I'm a fan of all the tart flavors they had and I even saw pickle flavor which I had heard about before, but wasn't brave enough to taste this time. I opted for the pink Sweetarts flavor and my fella ordered The Congo smoothie. I enjoyed the texture and presentation quite a bit. The umbrella was a nice touch. The flavor wasn't as tart as I would have hoped, but it really did taste like a Sweetart. The smoothie was nice as well. A little too much banana flavor for me, but my fella was loving it. 

The texture of the ice is really nice. It holds the flavor very well and despite the heat, it took forever to melt which is a plus for me since I tend to be a pretty slow eater when it comes to dessert or cold things. 

They have color-changing spoons that change color when they are cold, which is adorable. I'm definitely keeping it to entertain myself. I know it's a chain, but I love having a shave ice place that is indoors that is conveniently located. I'll be back for sure.",2013-07-23 04:56:11

 So many things went wrong with our visit today. 
While trying to get to the salad/hot food bar the kitchen took this time to change EVERYTHING at the same time! Much was full, they were pulling every food item & breaking up all of the ice. The sauteed kale used to be good, it is so many different levels of being cooked in 1 pan it's rediculous. There was everything to basically fresh non cooked kale to it's been sitting in the warming pan for a good hour all mixed together. If the cooks don't like kale they need to learn that customers do like it & cook it correctly, it tasted like they may have sauteed it ONCE that day then kept adding raw from the bag to the kale that's been sitting in the pan for a while. It sat on my never cleared table the whole dining experience because it is cooked so badly Nobody could get to anything on the salad bar because they are chipping at ice while the salads are being blocked by their bodies. Very unorganized & poorly planned. I went to culinary school & have worked in fine dining, this was a hug no no.
The outside tables were changed to these HORRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE low seating tables we had to croutch over to eat. Our server took at least 10 - 15 mins to get us water & beer & I had to hunt down somebody to get utensils for what salad/hot food we could get to. The meat cutter Rodezio meat cutters were non existent in the patio seating, the potatoes are very yummy but by the time you got meat they were cold. The meat was so bloody we were surprised it wasn't mooing. I don't mean that it was medium-rare or rare. It was a culinary term called blue-rare. The garlic-parmesian steak was so mushy, it was inedible. 
I would tell the meat cutters that the meat was too red, only 1 brought me back not bloody meat, the other's were like ""ok, no want meat"" The server went to the kitchen to get us more done meat, he brought back 2 types. One was cooked great, the other was cut thin but still total red inside (high flame, really fast). Since we were on the patio we also didn't get all the meats offered to us that the people sitting inside were offered.. We do not like the seafood addition at all. The cooks put all of the seafood on the same broiler plate which causes every thing, shrimp, scallops, I think they offer swordfish or halibut .. it all tastes like salmon. Salmon is strong, shrimp & scallops are delicate & should NOT be cooked with salmon thus everything tasting like salmon We didn't order this addition & do not recommend it.
We were not the only people on the patio complaining about the absence of meat cutters. Hey Pampa's hire a couple more per shift!!!
We had to ask 2 different people 3 times if we could get more water, upon my 3rd request I wasn't nice anymore & did mention that this was the 3rd time requesting water ... they do charge for water...fine but get us a refill on our 1st request, took us about 30+ minutes to finally get a water refill. In my opinion having to ask for a water refill is a sign of a bad server.
Then let's get to our bill... It took at least 20 minutes of sitting with our dirty, never cleared plates waiting at our super uncomfortable table & chairs to get just the bill, I mentioned that we just want our bill because we are very uncomfortable at these horrible tables/chairs & would like to leave. Another 20mins to get our credit card back. During this time we do not have any water & are very thirsty. 
Now, we will return because a visiting family member has a gift card for here... however, the next time wile NOT sit on the patio at uncleared tables & uncomfortable tables/chairs. (Pampa's.. who's stupid idea was it to use these chairs & tables?) We'll be INSIDE, where the chairs & tables are more comfortable, the meat cutters actually come around more frequently inside & we can have a view of when the kitchen staff is finally finished overhauling the whole salad bar at once. We will also request our bill 30 minutes in advance of our wanting to leave & request a few extra waters to begin with. Hopefully we'll have a server who removed dirty plates full of improperly sauteed kale. This was a bad experience, hopefully Pampa's returns to their former selves.",2018-08-08 04:28:27

This is a way overdue review...came to this place May 2010 with my boyfriend when we visited Aria for the first time. We were looking for a place to grab a bite and happened to pass by Julian Serrano.  We walked in and got seated right away.  We looked at their menu and weren't sure what to order, we ended up taking the waiter's suggestions.  We ordered:

*Avocado Cannelloni from their New Tapas menu. This dish from what I remember was seaweed with avocado for $14.

*Gambas shrimp from their Ceviches and Seafood menu for $12.  This dish had 4 pieces of sauteed shrimps, garlic and arbol chili.

When we got our dishes, my BF and I looked at each other surprised - our dishes were small and realized this place was an expensive place to eat.  Our food was delish and we loved both; but we walked out starving.

This place is a nice place if you have the money to spend, otherwise go elsewhere.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the food here, you're pretty much paying for the taste and presentation; you just have to be willing to spend you money on food.

I would go back here if I win some extra cash from gambling, otherwise i'm spending my money on food somewhere else where I can get fool off one meal =)",2011-08-07 00:21:20

If you like vodka, this is the place to be. I was delighted to see that they had potato vodka as I can't do liquor made of grains (gluten allergy). I ended up having a Moscow Mule (amazing!) and a White Ruskie (their version of a White Russian). While the White Ruskie was good, the MM was way better. Can't go wrong with a refreshing gingery lime drink served in a copper cup. We also got a complimentary shot of vodka with our drinks. How cool is that?!

Overall, the service was ok. It took us forever to get a server with the iPad menu and then to order drinks. Once we got our first drink, they became attentive and service drastically improved.

I didn't try any food but I heard that the wings were to die for. They were not GF. :(

This place is a solid 4 stars.  You're not going to find anything in Tempe that really competes on this level, as even the nicest places in Tempe are corporate balloon knots and do not offer a true fine dining experience like Trick's.

I went here with my lovely lady on a Friday night and posted up at the bar.  The bar is tits and it's outside with trees growing out of it.  It has this Swiss Family Robinson type of vibe that's really cool. The entire property is a couple of buildings and the patio/bar, and it's a cool setup.

The food selection is legit, with a hefty portion devoted to seafood.  We dove into the seafood and got an order of the scallops and an order of the mussels. The scallops were legit.  Cooked perfectly, presented beautifully and garnished thoughtfully.  The Mussels dish was also a winner: Mussels were fresh and cooked well, and the sauce was just awesome with the sausage in it.  I devoured it.

It had a wonderful flavor and the avocado was a great addition to the soup. 

They really made this new location look great. I loved the windows all the way around the restaurant until someone decided they needed to open them. It wasn't warm out, the temps were only in the 60's and it was windy so as soon as the windows opened everyone's napkins started flying around. Most folks appeared to be cold, when people start putting on sweaters/jackets while you're opening the windows, it might be a sign the windows don't need to be open.

I absolutely love this place, obviously don't come often, as it is pricey but you get a lot of food!  It doesn't seem like much, but when you get a four course meal, the little stuff adds up quickly!  Plus you can always ask for as many extras as you want with the cheese and chocolate fondues for no extra charge.  So be prepared to eat alot and leave stuffed!

During my lastest adventure to the Melting Pot, I called to ask for reservations and asked for a little more private or secluded booth as to not be out in the open and enjoy a nice romantic dinner.  They delivered, put us upstairs in a booth secluded from others.  The staff there always seems very nice, knowledgable, and just great all around.  Great Service! 

The Cheese, I've had the fiesta, spinach artichoke, and one of the specials they were running.  Fiesta was definitely my favorite, but I liked them all.  Can't go wrong with cheese!

Salads, I've had the house, ceasar, and spinach salads.  All good, but I think I prefer their caesar.  They do put some kind of garlic or some kind of seeds in their ceasar salads - something different, but good!

Meats and Cooking - all have been good for the most part.  Although this last time, I didn't care for how their chicken was flavored, I enquired about it, and it actually had a hint of chocolate on it! We have always upgraded our cooking style, coq a vin is what I've had two of the three times and I really like it, especially with the flavoring of the vegetables.

Now onto the chocolate.  That of course is my favorite.  I love to dip the strawberries, rice krispy treats, and cheesecake with the chocolate!  I would have never thought of rice krispy treats, but they are just delightful!  Even have asked for extra of those!  My favorite chocolate hands down is the turtle - chocolate with caramel and nuts, yummy!

Generally, you leave them a voice mail and hope that they call you back with your desired availabilities. The interior exuded a rustic, communal vibe that felt very welcoming. We sat at the upstairs dining area which overlooked the entire open kitchen, as well as their famous wood-burning oven. There was also a roof window which allowed plenty of sunlight to brighten up the space. 

I wasn't feeling for anything alcoholic that day, so my boyfriend and I each ordered a house-made soda ($3 each). He chose the cherry flavour, and I went with the white soda, which was an elevated version of a Sprite. The sodas were very delicious and refreshing, and they're a great alternative to cocktails. 

The rest of our party was more than half an hour late for our 6 pm reservation, but thankfully, the staff was very gracious about it. I've previously had some bad experience with another restaurant's staff giving me attitude when I was 20 minutes late for a reservation, so I really appreciated the staff's understanding here. Once everyone placed their orders, we were given a basket of Woodlot's sourdough bread. I'm a huge fan of sourdough bread, especially served warm with butter!

Now onto the food!

Baked caramelized onion soup ($11) with aged gruy√®re and red fife sourdough bread. This onion soup certainly wasn't lacking in onions! There were heaps and heaps of sweet caramelized onions with every spoonful of soup! I also liked that the soup wasn't overly laden with cheese, which made it less heavy. Of course, French onion soups are extremely rich in nature, so sharing is highly recommended!

Two of my friends shared ember grilled hen-o'-the-woods mushrooms ($13) with wild rice, black walnut, mache and balsamic vinegar. The portion looked rather small, but I was told that it was actually quite filling. I didn't try any but heard good feedback about this starter. 

Whey-fed pork chop ($28) with prune, bacon, brown bread and walnut sauce. This was an outstanding dish, both in flavours and presentation. I sampled one piece of pork chop and it blew my mind off. I hardly ever order pork chop at a restaurant (unless it's deep fried) because it's often dry and bland. But Woodlot's pork chop was moist, flavourful, and just truly delicious. I'll definitely be coming back soon to order this for myself. 

Russet potato gnocchi ($23) with roasted aubergine, graine de paradis, chili, lemon and ricotta salata.  I really enjoyed the piece that I tried. The texture was perfect, and the flavours were bold and bright.

Naturally raised flat iron steak ($29) with mixed mushroom and b√©arnaise sauce. It was another stunning presentation on a wooden plank. I also thought that the steak was very tasty, and the b√©arnaise sauce was a lovely complement to both the meat and earthy mushrooms

Chicken and porcini mushroom pie ($27) with sherry cream, sunchoke, parsnip and parsley root.. The pastry was tasty and flaky, but the fillings didn't wow me. I actually liked the parsnips a lot, so I thought that there was too much chicken and not enough veggies, especially mushroom. Perhaps I'm not a big fan of chicken pot pies in general, but I preferred all the other entr√©es over mine.

Spiced bread pudding ($11) with chocolate chantilly, candied pecan and brown butter. At first, I mistook the chocolate chantilly for ice cream, and I think ice cream would've been a better pairing here. The chantilly was too rich on top of the dense bread pudding. In all honesty, the dessert was quite similar to a chocolate muffin. It was a bit of a let down after the fabulous entr√©es.

I feel a deep need to come back to Woodlot as soon as possible because I truly loved everything except my own entr√©e and the dessert. All in all, the food and service were fantastic, and the restaurant definitely lived up to my expectations!",2012-06-05 17:44:14

I got the 'Dumpling Noodle Soup w/ Dragon bone'. I dunno what a Dragon Bone is, so I didn't want it. I asked for more dumplings! It came out pretty quick, maybe less than 5 mins. I also got two steam buns with meat. One pork and chive. Second was leeks and meat for 99 cents each.

Soup noodle was alright. I can see the guy doing the fresh noodle is actually pretty hard labour work. The noodles are not my fav, but its different from eating ramen noodles for sure. The steam buns were ordinary. I like it how you can order individually.

They run your car through the carwash they flag you to come get your car, you look at your car and you're questioning... did you actually wash my car?  Yesterday took the cake when I walked up to my car and found spots everywhere and I mean everywhere on the car.  Not only was there residue from it being dirty but I watched the car come out of the car wash, I watched my car being driven to the line where they dry it and I watched as no one put a towel anywhere on the body of the car, not one time so when I walked up to get my car when it was ready it was no surprise that there were water spots all over the entire car. When I pointed out the water marks and dirt to the so-called manager or line leader he tried to tell me the marks were tree sap and that's why it did not come off. That's hysterical, tree sap is clear and sticky and this was clearly birdshit it was yellow and you can scratch it off. Besides, I do not have any trees at home and there are no trees at the work lot where the car gets parked! He then had one of the people come over with a bottle full of window cleaner and sprayed it on the paint in the hood to wipe it off, gee thanks you a****** thanks for ruining my paint I mean how inconsiderate and stupid can they be?  Bottom line they did a s***** job. He then pointed to the two men at the end of the car wash tunnel and said see them, they wipe the car down and dry it when it comes out of the tunnel before we put it in line so these water spots are not from us... to which I responded, no they didn't because I stood here and watched it come out of the tunnel and watched your driver get in and put it in line and then watched it sit there for no less than 8 minutes and no one ever put one towel on the body of my car. Again so-called manager continued to dispute with me then he brought over back up because he's an idiot and they agreed with him. Of course they all back each other up because they run a shoddy business and do half-assed work there. They ended up bringing two people over to actually clean all the crap off the car and the pictures I posted here are what my car look like AFTER they went over it yet a second time. I told him I wanted my money back and they would not give me a refund. So $15 later, look at the pictures and you be the judge.  I don't need to persuade anyone because pictures tell a thousand words. This car is brand new I even put the mileage on here (2,400 miles) so people could see that there's no reason for my paint to look the way it did when it came out of the car wash and to look at all the spots and the dirt residue all over the car.  Jackson's position was it was my paint job and all the water spots were not from their lack of drying my car off. I cannot wait for the new Cobblestone to open up on 19th Avenue and Happy Valley I will never return to this car wash again and I will drive 12 miles to get my car washed before I ever return to a Jackson's let alone this location ever again in my lifetime.

They focus all of their efforts on local, and organic produce in almost all of their dishes. The restaurant itself is decorated super nice and the overall atmosphere is awesome. My wife and I decided to share a wrap that was stuffed with a bunch of fresh veggies and tofu. The overall flavor of the wrap was good, but I felt like it was lacking something. I did put on one of the hot sauces that they offer and that made it really flavorful. It came with a pretty generous portion of a side salad. While I do understand that serving organic produce can hike up the prices, the price for the wrap was a little steep at $15. However, it was actually a pretty good sized wrap despite the price point. We also ordered a specialty pancake that I was not a fan of at all. I also ordered a side of chips and salsa and I did like the flavor of the salsa but the chips texture were a little off.

Setting: I have been here during its grand opening and have returned for its re-grand opening. The decor of the restaurant has been updated with an improved layout to the sauce station. Previously the sauce station was on what looked like a plastic wedding cake design now in a more buffet style, but is a bit cramp as many diners will be all over experimenting with sauces and other additions. The party area does boast individual hot pot stoves for large parties and a large stove in the middle for the larger broth option. 

Service: Pretty typical but it was a busy Saturday night, we seem to have three different servers tending to our tables. Drinks were a tad slow but nothing to lose yourself over. 

Food: The oxtail broth, new cuts of meat, add new items on the conveyor belt (chicken feet, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon). Being a big oxtail fan, I chose the oxtail broth which was... a bit bland. The sauce station helped play a nice role as I experimented with my broth by adding spicy, salty, bitter, sweet etc... till it matched exactly what I wanted. Wagyu was beautifully marbled with a nice chewy but not so melt in your mouth texture. 

Personal Choice: Tomato broth and the spicy broth are great! Brisket + Wagyu Beef + side of enoki + rice. Bam! 

Overall: One of my favorite places to eat hot pot. Great quality meat and savory flavorful broth, this place has it all!",2017-05-30 03:48:52

Since we are barely in the North side of town, we decided to try out an eatery that we cannot visit often in Henderson.  We decided on 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate.

When we arrived, there was a group of guys in front of us.  Their orders came out and majority got the garlic chicken.  In addition, the portion looked huge.  Earl and I decided on the 2 meat combo.  We got the Kahlua pork and cabbage, as well as the garlic chicken.  It came with a scoop of rice and choice of mac salad or green salad.  We opted for the green salad.  The food came out after 10 minutes.  The Kahlua pork and cabbage was very tasty.  Just the right about of seasoning.  The garlic chicken was super flavorful.  It was crispy, sweet, and a bit spicy.  The mayo aioli was a great addition to this chicken.  The green salad had some brown, due to the old lettuce.  Was not very fresh.

i think that if i hadn't had spent so long searching for a joint that was open and starvingly had to stop here before hunger completely overwhelmed me, i would have just gone to a more familiar mexican drive-thru, like the one at 5th ave and camelback, or 40th st and indian - all which serve some pretty dank breakfast burritos.

but i ended up here, and the food was meh. it didn't really hit the spot like i was hoping it would have. too much cheese and the bacon wasn't cooked long enough and was fatty. my friends got chorizo burritos which were bland and extremely greasy. i usually try to avoid fili's and go to one of the sister/knockoff joints like rollbertos, eribertos, armandos, etc.",2009-06-15 04:34:20

QlIcKiT2NrMM1qUJQVyehQ,Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3TRgD3KLVis61eGvMZrykA,3,1,0,0,"Came here for dinner for my grandmother's birthday on Mid Jan 2017 after who knows how many owner changes since original opening on SK Seafood. As my grandmother loves seafood, we were definitely ordering some seafood. After being sat at our table and entire party has arrived shortly, the waitress brought us the menus, hot tea, and gave us a few minutes to decide on what to order. 

Lobster was if i remember correctly, $25/lb. There was a recommendation on quail as well for $28/ea. We had ordered 1 of the quail to try as it was a recommendation and a lobster cooked with green onions and ginger, on top of a bed of E-mein. On the wall, there are a lot of specials listed (though all in chinese so I personally cant read it, but my family can). We had ordered sand ginger chicken, deep fried chicken knee (more on this later lol), cumin lamb, garlic snow pea leaves, spicy wine clams, and preserved veggie large (pig) intestine. 

We were told the table next to us had a lobster about 4.5 lbs. When she brought ours out, she said it was the next biggest at 3.5ish. Oh well. Still live at least xD 

Soup came out which was a house dried veggie soup with pork neck bone, etc. Temp was luke warm. Flavor was decent but seemed maybe a little watered down. 

First to come out was the Lobster and Quail (cut to 6 pieces, enough to share). Quail's skin was perfectly crispy with moist, juicy meat under. A side of salt to dip in for flavor. Lobster was cooked perfectly as well. Lots of meat to share. The lobster as said was on a bed of E-mein. This was more of the disappointing part of the dish. The noodles were overcooked and over soft. The width of the noodles seemed to be bigger than the E-mein we had expected. Aside from the noodles, the lobster was amazing ! 

Deep fried chicken knee... ok some history on this for me. My first time having this dish was in Vancouver in 2004 at a wonton noodle place. They had it as a special so we ordered it to try. Simply deep fried chicken knees (the cartilage part of like the drumstick). Seasoned with salt and pepper. Simple and good ! When i went to Vancouver in 2012, i had to have it again. When we saw it on the specials menu, we had to order it.... It was good overall but it was not entirely the same cartilage part. i noticed some cartilage was from the breast bone, etc etc... my grandma said the had chicken skin too... So... not too genuine on the ingredients they used but still tasted pretty good. Seasoned with salt n pepper and deep fried garlic. 

Garlic snow peas leaves is simple and fresh. Good amount. Nothing else needs to be said. 

Preserved veggie large intestine was flavored well too. Big pieces of large intestine cooked with bell pepper, preserved veggie. Almost like a sweet and sour pork ! except with bell pepper, preserved veggies, black beans, and large intestine... love large intestine. cooked well. had a good ""bite"" to it still. Large fatty pieces. YUM !

Spicy wine clams was pretty decent. Not too spicy. The glass noodles soaked up the soup pretty fast. After a while, they were super fat noodles ! The clams were pretty good. Good amount of clams as well. Had enough to need to pawn off to the ""larger eaters"" of the family (me... -__-"") by the end of the meal. 

The cumin lamb and the sand ginger chicken was the most disappointing dishes of the meal. The sand ginger chicken (tbh iunoe what it was called in the menu, this is directly translated) had a very mild sand ginger flavor and was not savory at all. We ended up using the side salt from the quail for this dish. The cumin lamb, when it originally arrived, we asked the waitress if this was the right order. It seemed to have a lot of leek, celery, etc cooked with sliced lamb. The ""cumin"" flavor was super mild even when we told the waitress we liked spicy and a lot of cumin flavor. She had brought it back to the kitchen to ask to have more cumin added but even after it returned, there was still not much flavor. 

Overall, this meal was pretty decent except the last 2 dishes. The dessert (mung bean soup) was very mildly sweet as well with minimal mung bean. So i guess the last 3 items.. Meal costed a little over $200 for 6 people, with the lobster being almost half the cost.",2017-01-20 01:49:11

The service is fairly slow and easygoing here. I don't know if that's the normal since there weren't that many tables there. My first course of scallops with a balsamic reduction arrived at a speedy clip, but then there was a large amount of time till the main course arrived for us. When it finally came out though I was kind of intrigued by the presentation. I had ordered a braised lamb shank with potato gnocchi. However they were portioned on separate dishes. My lamb looked so lonely down on it's massive plate with a nice sauce running around, and then a small plate of gnocchi beside it. This just leaves a very disjointed feeling to the dish where everything doesn't exactly match together. It left me a bit sad, until dessert came! I had the very decadent panna cotta paired with a balsamic berry compote. The only thing I'd change about this is the fact that there's not enough compote to go with the panna cotta and once you run out all you have left is a one note dessert of sugary cheese. Needless to say I didn't finish it, our server accidentally brought out an extra tiramisu and he handled it by just giving it to us. Nice, I never turn down free stuff! Speaking of free stuff the complimentary limoncello for dessert is a nice touch. Though they don't exactly make that clear so make sure you ask about that.

Go early in the morning or in the later afternoon. In the middle of the summer it is unbearably hot, at least for me. Take water, even if you plan on walking 10 minutes and coming back.

(it was about 30 degrees).  So I do some shopping, stopped at the Post Office and more than an hour later she's still their eating out of a very large bag of potato chips.
I'm not trying to be cynical here.  This was just a funny observation.  Maybe she was hired by the store to do a living statue routine.
Getting back to the 2 star rating...I felt was fair when I noticed a male cashier had written his phone number on my credit card receipt.  I guess that's the way men do it here.

The staff at reception were very friendly and check in and out were efficient.  

Elevators were old, slow and small.  Hallways were a bit dated. 

My room was clean and spacious and had a full mini kitchen in it which I didn't use. The bed was comfy.  Wasn't crazy about the bathroom, it was small and there was a bit of mildew in the shower and water pressure wasn't great.

The Saturday night in June I came with my friend, the bride-to-be, we were one of five bachelorette parties there that night. It was early in the evening, so everyone was well behaved. Our group was only obviously a bachelorette party because of the sheer number of us. I am confused by this place because it seems to be set-up more as a restaurant than a bar, unlike what the name suggests. Yes, I get that the name is a pun. But, you can't call yourself a bar and then seem annoyed that people are there to stand around and drink. I'm also confused by the food thing because I've never heard anyone say the draw of the chocolate bar is the food...everyone wants to try the chocolate martinis. I saw the menu. I don't remember anything from it. I don't blame the staff for seeming annoyed by the crowded bar...the bar is in the center of the space and must walk through the area to get to tables near the front. We felt in the way the entire evening servers need to navigate through the crowd. I have no problem with busy bars; the problem is that we really were in the way, and that really is my only complaint. 

The staff was working very hard to keep everyone served, but the disorganization caused by the cluster at the bar was off putting to other groups as well. Normally, I prefer busy bars, but since martinis need to be sipped, especially sweet ones, I'm only going back on a quiet evening.

Otherwise it's like complaining about loud music at a nightclub, or nudity at a strip joint.   And, I've been a few times and have only had good service.

My favorite taco for taste was Pork on a Fork's pulled pork taco. I am not a big fan of pork and rarely eat it, but went back for a second taco from here! I will also be frequenting them for lunch along with my bf soon.
Favorite chicken taco was from Sandbar and the jalepeno mac n cheese was also a treat.
Biggest bang for your tickets were Dos Gringos (2 street tacos for one ticket!) and Rubio's- a full size taco (mahi mahi habenero, yum!)
The best beef taco I had was from Milagro grill. They had quite a line, but luckily, it was worth the wait and now I want to go their for dinner sometime.
Friendliest booth was Macayo's, and their guacamole was muy muy delicioso!

I didn't like that smoking was allowed, and to add it to it, a gal was walking around selling cigars. I came with a minor cold, and left feeling sick as a dog (not from any food, just from being really congested and exhausted from the heat!)

I also could not find Yelp, or Jenny. I asked at Information and they had no clue :( 
I was looking to give out a high five!
I also disliked the high admission price. Thank goodness Yelp hooked it up with 50% off!
Water costing $4 at an outdoor festival when you can get 2 tacos for $2 is also ridiculous. However, the same place (Dos) you could get 2 tacos for 1 ticket, you could also get a water for 1 ticket. Everyone else I saw wanted 2 tickets for a 16.9 ounce bottle of water!
Some of the seating was shaded, which was fantastic, but overall, not enough seating for the amount of people.

Foxley made a lot of noise when Tom Thai first opened it.  But since I didn't run to go wait in a line, I eventually forgot about it.  Then Cracker came home one day (when we were still roomies) and gushed about how delicious it was.  Then I moved and eventually forgot about it.

But yesterday, I walked right by it.  Couldn't miss it.  Glad I didn't.

Yesterday evening my BFF, his boys and I were looking for a place to grab dinner.  Monday is really not the best day for a night out, so many things are closed.  The Flash, aka one of my BFF's longstanding friends, suggested Campagnolo.  We walked there only to find it was closed (but I just added it to my list so that's always a good thing.).  We proceeded to Black Hoof, only to find it was a 45 minute wait.  So we kept going until we hit foodie-hipster central, better known as Ossington.  From BQM to Libretto to Golden Turtle, it's a fat girl's paradise.

As we walked south, nothing really piqued our tastebuds.  Then we saw the Foxley sign and I suddenly remembered.  It's on my list.  

We ate.  Perhaps one ""small dish"" too many:
 
One of two cheviches we ordered.  
This is Nunavut Artic Char *thumbs up*
The other was scallops *thumbs down* 

Spicy Crispy Shrimps with Jalapenos and Garlic
REALLY REALLY GOOD 
 
Grilled Hanger Steak with Chimichuri
Good, but after the cod came out, it got demoted to okay. 

If I had to describe Foxley I would say it's a fusion bistro.  The menu strikes me as being a mix of Asian and South American flavours.

I had NO IDEA the adventure that was in store for me when I took my coffee lovin' friend to the Starbucks Reserve store. The inside has such a spacious and open air feel to it with 32,000 square ft inside, glass paneled walls and an outdoor patio. We wanted to be where all the action takes place so we parked ourselves at the middle of the bar; William was our wonderful and knowledgeable guide. 

We ordered the House Affogato (2 shots of Microblend 21 espresso with candied citrus & dark chocolate undertones, vanilla ice cream, Demerara Syrup & cinnamon) and the coffee flight. I asked for regular water to replace the sparkling water they give as a palate cleanser. We watched in fascination as they used the following:

- High-tech Clover brewer - a full immersion brewer with vacuum filtration.

- Black Eagle espresso machine - the same as the one used in the World Barista Championships

- Siphon method - ""a theatrical display of science and coffee"". I would describe it as a caffeine addicted mad scientist using his bunsen burner and beakers to make a cup of coffee.

Now I'm not a purest and have NEVER drank coffee black. When I tried the first coffee of the flight all I could taste was the bitterness. I added a little bit of sugar to cut the bitterness and VIOLA! I could taste the subtle flavors of candied citrus, dark chocolate, caramel COOL! I found an interesting study by the Chemistry Department of the University of York on how sugar influences the fundamental chemistry of coffee (https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2015/research/tea-coffee-sugar-chemistry/). 

Starbucks reserve really shines with their customer service (disclaimer: do not go during rush hours, the staff will not have the time to cater to you). The baristas in black aprons (the regular staff wear green) are undergoing or have finished a rigorous coffee master's training where they learn the history and science behind coffee; are trained on the different brewing methods; and even undergo a blind taste test to identify different coffees. Their passion for coffee really shows, as they eagerly answer any and all questions. 

Drinks may be pricey but it's all worth it when you walk away with a new appreciation of all the work that goes behind making the perfect cup of coffee.",2018-06-01 04:25:30

Based on some of the other reviews I was nervous; cafeteria lighting (it was bright but not overbearing), ketchupy-sauce (it did have a bit of ketchup tang but the ribs were delish without it), too small portioned sides (I say they were just enough - in like medium sized ramekins), overpriced (this is Avon - what out there doesn't cost at least a decent amount?), not enough sauce (our ribs came with a side but I barely used any, I don't think you need it), fatty ribs (the boneless baby back - not at all, but the St. Louis style got a little weirdly fatty/cartiledgey at the end), no wet naps (we each got one at the end of the meal), slow waitresses (ours was super attentive, but we came in on a Thursday night), but none of this was a real problem during our visit.

The ambiance for the upstairs is more date-ish although I was here with Yelp friends. We decided to do the tasting menu since we went on a Tuesday (Tasting Tuesdays) but without the optional wine pairing for an additional $20. It doesn't really make financial sense to do the optional wine pairing b/c you get 4 tastes of wine and when you look at the menu there's only one taste size that is $5 - all the others range from $2.50-$3.50?!?! Let's do some simple math - 4 wine tastes should at least be $5 to make this worth it (4x5=20). So I opted to just get 2 half glasses of wine (which came under $20). 

So the tasting was a bit odd b/c it's like a grab bag of items. You don't get to choose what you want, there is not a set ""tasting menu"" - it's a anything that the chef/server decides to give you - you eat sorta deal and that's your tasting. 

So everyone at our table got different dishes from each other at each course (4 courses total). It would have been nice to either have received the same thing for each course so we could discuss (even if we didn't know what it would be) or if there was a set tasting menu. Bizarre! 

While I enjoyed some of the dishes I had (fried tomatoes, caesar salad with strawberries, hanger steak) I wasn't overly impressed. As you can see I only remember 3 out of the 4 dishes I had - nothing too memorable. An annoying this was before they serve you - they ask if there are any allergies and how you'd like your meat to be prepared. I explicitly said MEDIUM-WELL - since I'm not a big meat eater I prefer my meat to be cooked. Well when I got the hanger steak it was mostly red - it was tender, but it was still annoying b/c what's the point of telling them you're preferences if they're not going to do anything about it. 

The service was a bit off as they didn't really check on us and the server wasn't too great with recommendations (he had none especially when it came to the wine). But they did redeem themselves and acknowledged their negligence and gave us a free tasting of wine (but it was super-sweet wine so none of us finished it) and then they gave us a selection of free desserts. They gave us a lemon pie of some sort, rhubarb something, peanut butter ice cream sandwich and balsamic ice cream. I liked the lemon pie and the peanut butter ice cream sandwich. 

The free wine and dessert was a nice gesture on their part, but couldn't make up for the other issues.",2011-07-13 15:39:07

The last few times we have gone in for burgers, there were problems. Not serious enough to write you off, we would wait a little while, then head back and try again. Problems again. 

What kind of problems you ask?
- The past FIVE times, my wife has ordered grilled mushrooms on her burger. The past FIVE times, she has received ZERO mushrooms on her burger.
- Every third time or so, your food works like McDonald's and Burger King - a la a guaranteed intestinal cleanse. Not pleasant at all.
- The size of the mayo/thousand island cups has shrunk to where a french fry folded in half is as wide as the mouth of the cup. Seriously?!
- Finally, despite re-assurances from the staff, there is no way in hell those are hand-pressed burgers. So dry, tough and flavorless, That is the signature of pre-made patties.*

If the burger maintained its hand-pressed tastiness, we could get over the other items, or at least, feel up for the gamble of if we had to race home and to the bathroom. No sense in continuing to support food that declined so much.

Also, having staff engaging in lengthy discussions about how much they hate other staff members that aren't there, with each other - and regular customers, is very unprofessional. If you have an issue with that person, talk to them, deal with it, shut up or quit. I don't want to feel involved in your drama, because that is the only thing that could be heard in the restaurant.

 First the new person taking my rx took so long to type everything in that she figured I couldn't wait to pay and told me I could pay the next day when I picked things up. That's fine-ok. Odd, but ok. Then I get a call saying that my date of birth I gave them doesn't match what my insurance carrier has. really? because that's never been an issue in filling an rx anywhere else. Then i get that mess sorted out (I was right, my insurance has the date of birth correct) and the rx ""goes through"" and Melrose offer to call when its ready! Awesome. 

Then, not so awesome, I confirm that the two rxs I have are injections and that they will be filling the third prescription i gave them for the syringes. I then get asked if I recall what size and type those syringes are. I tell her that no, I don't and thats why there is another prescription with that information in their possession. She sounds confused by this.
Not a good sign.

To complicate things further, there are two sizes of syringes and I'm hoping when I get these they can remind me of which needle goes with which and can tell me how much to inject of each, but that might be asking for too much.

I've been to Zipps dozens of times at a variety of locations around the valley, with the Camelback location being closest to my house currently.

If you're eating and hanging out for a few hours watching a game or playing shuffleboard three drinks isn't that much. 

Also service is super spotty. Sometimes they're nice and enthusiastic, other times they disappear for seemingly hours on end and act inconvenienced when you ask for things like water or extra ranch? 

Golden medium wings is where it's at. Trust me, try them. (Their hot wing sauce is HOT, by the way).

Maybe I was lucky? Maybe it was a Sunday?

I have quite a decent meal at Il Fornello and the service was terrific! 

Linguine di Mare ($19)
- too saucy and that made the pasta a little too soggy
- Seafood is plentiful and fresh: Mussels, Calamari, Shrimps and Scallops

Rigatoni Bolognese ($16)
- pasta cooked al dente with a good bit and texture
- meat sauce is rich and bold

Chocolate Souffle ($11)
- a little overpriced with the portion 
- More like a warm brownie with ice cream but really hit the spot! I am biased with warm chocolate everything

Service... Attentive and Cheerful... I love my waiter! He alone worth that extra 0.5 star!

Will try to come back on Tuesday for their $10 Pizza Special! Hopefully really soon!",2012-04-06 03:50:59

We had to use their parking garage, or was going to - the show is at The D. There were attendants standing around, doing nothing. They watched us drive, we were driving slow enough with our windows down they could have easily told us the garage was full. Instead, they just stood there with a stupid look on their face watching us drive to the top. We get there - no parking! The garage is really tight - no way to really turn around without difficulty. It was rough to do so, as several cars would get stuck at the top with no way to turn around without blocking the other cars en-route to the top. Many of us were had a hard time navigating around each other, turning around in tight spaces, etc... they should have put a sign up, warned us, could have saved us a LOT of time and trouble, and we could have not even gone up there in the first place. Many people were late for the show and missed it, due to this hassle. Very poor customer service. The garage, esp near the top, had a lot of trash and construction debris lying around. We did get in the hotel long enough to know that if I were choosing a place in Vegas, there's many other places I'd pick before this one. You can certainly do better! Without ample parking, what are you going to do when you get there and you have no spot? Let me tell you, they will NOT care.

I went here with my girlfriends on several occasions and we tried the following martinis: Chocolate Chocolate Mint, White Chocolate, Raspberry Truffle, and Strawberry Cheesecake. The first three are deeelicious, the last one was okay. It didn't have the right consistency as the first 3. They all tasted as it sounds and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try this place out. I haven't tried any of the other flavors but these would be my favorite ones. 

On one occasion, we did also try their shooters. First, it is the most tasty shot because the holders are actually chocolate and we tried all the flavors: Ballys, Godiva Chocolate and White Chocolate, Espresso Vodka, Chambord, and Kahlua. Out of these, I'd say I liked the Godiva chocolate better only because I'm a big fan for Godiva chocolates as well. 

For appetizers, we had the tomato and fresh mozzarella, artichoke and spinach dip. The first one I wasn't too crazy for because literally it came with just the two. A drizzle of chocolate was presented as an addition but that didn't do much good because the dish didn't really have much taste. However, the dip was fantastic. The pita bread was toasted and in perfect temperature. 

For dessert, we had their crepes (banana foster) and their chocolate fondue. The crepes was pretty stacked with plenty of nutella and bananas. It was definitely sweet and for those who have a sweet tooth this dish is for you! The fondue was fun and plenty to share with your girlfriends. It had bananas, strawberries, and some other cookies/biscuits/dippables. 

This place is great for bachelorette and birthday parties as well as girl night outs. From my recent visit with a friend of mine, I ordered an oatmeal raisen shot and it was definitely a kicker. I believe it had baileys and gold schlagger. It had a ginger taste to it but it was really good.

 They had a fire several years ago and they shut down. To be honest, I didn't realize they have reopened, until we were out there last week .
 We came in and requested a table for two.  They had one available immediately.  We wanted a booth though.  They were very nice about it and said it would just be a little bit of a wait. It was about a 20 minute wait but we didn't mind because you're like a booth. They kept checking on us and letting us know the status. I found that was very nice . 
 Anyway, the chips and salsa are absolutely incredible there. Chips are light and fresh. Salsa is absolutely delicious. The Green Salsa is incredible with mango in it .
 I got the chicken Malay. It was fantastic. They were out of rice,  they close at eight and it was already 7:35. So I took just the black beans everything was really good.
 My dining partner got the fish tacos. Also excellent!

Oh, well!

I also really like the texts (so signup!) offering discounts during football season when the Bears win a game.  Nice!  The only drawback is the location off I-17 and Happy Valley.

Joey (Jose) was eager to help. He could tell just looking at my husband what size he neeeded, and when measured he was absolutely right!! He helped pick out ties and dress shirts while husband was in dressing room saving us so much time!

Taking the time to answer questions from other customers, throw away boxes, and checking in on us were ALL signs of an AWESOME sales associate who actually works!!

My husband and our best friend both needed suits. His talent for fashion was much appreciated by us customers. We left with the suits needed for my daughters wedding, and we were so happy no alterations were needed!

I tried to drown the saltiness with some salsa and ended up with a burning mouth lol. 
Service was good. We were the only people there so it went smoothly. When you order the meat you want, they warm it up on the flat top. I can see this being a problem if there was a long line of people.

No matter, though.

For I found them today, all stealth mobile-like, nestled in a corner of the old town Scottsdale Farmers Market, in a wondrous orange Chevy bus.

And I tried a couple of flavors: the Cheese Duo, which is bleu cheese and fig doing the Lambada (The Forbidden Dance). Seriously. I never thought bleu cheese and ice cream would go hand in hand, but then again, I've been eating garlic ice cream in Gilroy since I was a wee little lad, so why am I remotely surprised? 

This was excellent and original, though. But the morning was heating up and I wanted something a little lighter.

Enter the Basil Lime Sorbet. 

Holy holy. This has, currently for me, become the mother of all sorbets. All bow down before it. Incredible. The way the basil complements the lime, your taste buds are savoring every bit of it. The sour of the lime. The sweetness and the, uh, plantness of the basil. And given it's a sorbet, perfect for a hot day walking outside. Completely refreshing.  I'd eat 10 scoops of that in no time. But I had just one, because I'm being good and the day has barely begun. 

Added bonus: A cute little girl, no older than 3 or 4, yelling out ""Ice Cweam! Ice Cweam!"" from the window of the bus. A sales prodigy and not even in kindergarten. They should put her on Sweet Republic's marketing materials stat. Or even on a commercial for local TV. Far more endearing than that Express Flooring ""The Happy Home People!"" lady.

To conclude: I thought I'd go on with life without ever having a chance to savor Sweet Republic's hidden wares. But now that I know, you bet I'm going to find that bus again and try everything else.

As we entered the restaurant, my father-in-law and I admired the nice wine selection in the beautiful foyer.  When we were seated, I kept hearing a bump behind me in my seat, something was loose and it 'bumped' each time I moved.  Also, the acoustics are really bad in this place, so we were hearing conversations from afar and the baby sitting next to us crying was not helping.  The dry wall finishes look nice, but they reflect sounds.  I would suggest some more draperies around the place to deaden the noise.

We started off with a bottle of Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay and I had a cranberry martini, which was sweet and delicious.  Then we split off and ordered wine by the glass.  I asked the waitress for a white wine that would pair well with my meal and she brought me two wines and let me taste both before making my selection.  I chose the smoother, less fruity French wine and it turned out to be the most expensive wine on the menu.  

First, we were given a small shrimp and orange bite-sized teaser, which was delicious.  As an appetizer, we ordered the sampler.  The pepsi shrimp was spicy-hot and delicious as was the cucumber salad it was served with.  The baby calamari with honey was amazing.  It was perfectly cooked and the flavor was out of this world.  I could've eaten a lot more of this dish.  The chicken pot stickers were also off-the-hook-yummy.  The tuna tartar was fresh and delicious as well.  Our appetizers were amazing!

Then came our main courses.  My father-in-law ordered the Seared Tuna with Sea Scallop, which was served in a tomato broth.  Actually, the tuna was cooked correctly and tasted good, but it was swimming in a bowl of broth.  I've never seen this dish served this way and it displeased my father-in-law.

My mother-in-law ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin and this dish was the star of the night.  Not only was it a very generous portion, but the steak was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  Definitely one of the best steaks I've had the pleasure of tasting.  I will most definitely order this steak the next time I visit.  The mushrooms were good as were the green mashed potatoes.

My wife ordered the fish special, which was Sea Bass served with some vegetables.  It had a very delicate flavor and she really enjoyed it, seeing as it was one of the rare occasions that she orders fish and vegetables at a restaurant.

Finally, I ordered the Sauteed Sea Scallops dinner, which was served with a rich, cream sauce Risotto.  The first bite was amazing, the scallops tasted delicious and seemed to be cooked correctly.  As I continued to demolish this dish, the quantity and richness of the cream sauce began to go from delicious to overpowering.  I did not finish the dish as a) it was a large portion, b) the cream sauce was far too rich, and c) there was way too much cream sauce on everything.  I wish the scallops would have been separated from the sea of overly-rich cream sauce, but alas, no one is perfect.

My father-in-law ordered a glass of port and we all shared a Creme Brulee, which was the best one I've tried yet and it was beautifully presented.   Actually, the presentation of the dishes alone is worth the trip to this place.  They were each meticulously crafted and were all beautiful in their own way.  I took some photos and will post them soon.

8HFFMcnPU44tsStnrXXkXQ,_jpt07tQlw3KOkTM0fus2g,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,2,6,0,0,"Looks wonderful, even after the remodeling. The decor is impressive, the portions are great, and the menu is diverse. Unfortunately, this place has a serious service problem.

I used to come here frequently for dinner and afternoon tea/sweets. The Prime Rib special was always impressive, and many items from the pastry case were a great afternoon pick-me-up.

On my most recent visit for breakfast, my table ordered one Hot Tea, one Iced Tea, and an Orange Juice for beverages. Waitress returned with the Orange Juice and Iced Tea, and took our food order for French Toast, a side of Bacon, a Fruit Cup, Wheat Toast, and a side of Sausage. Keep in mind the place was busy, but there were plenty of empty tables.

It then took six minutes for the Hot Tea to be delivered. From that point, it took 25 minutes to get just the Fruit Cup! Then the French Toast, Sausage, and Wheat Toast were delivered - Bacon was missing and took an additional five minutes. Asking for water also took a long time.

I usually adore the French Toast - normally soft bread with delicious vanilla flavor. This order was dry and lacked flavor. Though it was warm, it definitely tasted old. 

On top of this, the waitress consistently brought just one item to the table (like the Fruit Cup) saying ""Voila!"" and then walking away. This happened at least four times. She never asked how the food was or if we needed more of anything. 

This slow service seems to plague the Grand Cafe. Before the remodeling there were some employees that were often rude and unwelcoming on several occasions. Slow service was also an issue, and had me steering away from eating here. I expected a turn towards better service after the remodeling - clearly that isn't the case.",2015-09-13 06:16:03
iheT7EFK9KfEp899PJ9x2A,rnfgjemszUlQx6U_-PO63w,aY8xiGLpTjIkz6FAJbCy7A,4,1,1,1,"I don't know how many times I passed by this place before realizing it was actually an eatery and not some old shut-down gas station.  I am glad that I finally found it, though.  My only issue on this trip was that I had Sophie with me.  Oh well, into the jacket she went, and into the restaurant we went.  

Amazingly tchotchky interior, but amazingly appropriate for the location, the history, and surprisingly not overdone.  Not a lot of other customers, but we were in at around 3pm -- a time when most other people are not eating.  Looking through the menu, I was surprised to find ""Tear Jerker"" flavor for the hot wings.  My first thought was, ""BAH!  People in Pittsburgh don't know what piquant is and that is what I will be getting.""  I then ruffled through the rest of the menu and we ordered the following items:

5 regular wings
5 tearjerker wings
split pea soup with ham
potato soup
DW Cheeseburger (plain/medium) with fries
Pepsi (x2)

I am uncertain about the full gamut of the menu, but they appeared to be fairly hospitable to those that were looking for gluten-free food as well as having many vegetarian and vegan options that were clearly marked on the menu.  

Our soups and drinks came out right after we ordered.  I didn't like the Split Pea soup.  It was grainy and tasted like it had just come out of a package.  I had a few bites and then just set it to the side.  I used my soda to wash the flavor from my mouth.  I didn't even bother to try the potato soup.  Not to long after I aborted soup consumption, the wings arrived.  My nose immediately caught the fragrance.  Oh...the smell was good.   My friend made it clear that I was not to have any of the regular since he was not going to eat any of the tear jerkers.

After having finished my scoffing at him, I went right for my wings.  The flavor was good.  They didn't burn.  I knew it; I continued on eating them leisurely while drinking my soda.  On the third wing, my nose, eyes and mouth burst into flames.  I couldn't believe it.  My complacency had caused me to be unprepared for the piquancy.  The delayed ignition only hurt my pride a little compared to my friend laughing at my running nose and the tears coming out of my eyes.

As I finished the fourth wing, the hamburger arrived.  I abandoned my last wing while I cut the burger in half.  It appeared to be more a medium-well than a medium temperature; this is a heads up to order a temperature lower.  The flavor was good and the meat wasn't overly dry.  I will order a medium-rare next time so that I get the proper temperature.  When I finished the burger, I ate the last wing.

I will return here.  There is no question about it.  I enjoyed the flavor of the wings, but next time I will not be unprepared.",2010-01-24 21:54:06

tSPz55GubUIJLaRLwtF4_Q,vMGSO3INkAa0SdFs7SwuIQ,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,5,2,3,1,"BEST PLACE TO EAT & SHOP!

Upon entering the store is like walking into your Grandma / or Country's friends home with that faint pumpkin spice / cinnamon / apple butter / bacon cooking / goodness aroma. This is truly a down-to-earth, family, home cooking type atmosphere. I love the warm feeling you receive from entering the doors. The hostess is friendly, the sales associates (if you have to wait & browse) are knowledgeable & outgoing. The layout, the items on display and for sale make this a cozy place to chill & walk around. If you want to extra chill while you wait, just sit in the cozy rockers outside. Note: If it's HOT weather in Vegas, they do have the ""water misters"" on to keep you cool while you wait.

WAIT TIME INFO: The store opens at 6am (no wait time) and probably starts getting busy at 9:30 am with a 1 hour wait time. As I'm sitting writing this, it's 11:22 am on a Wednesday, the wait time is only 30 minutes. YES, I've also been here at 6pm (duh dinner time) and had an hour plus wait time. Don't let the other reviews from people about WAIT TIMES scare you. 

There's a couple of factors that you have to consider when making a ""Cracker Barrel"" breakfast/lunch/dinner 'DO I WANT TO WAIT' decision:

#1: What time of day are you eating? If you want to save yourself some time, call them directly at the Dean Martin location and they will gladly let you know the current wait time. Their number is: (702) 474-1120 and PRESS #3 to speak to an Associate. I did this and they were so friendly! Challenge solved!

#2: They just opened THIS location on July 25th, 2016. Give them a break. You KNOW everyone and their Uncles & Grandmas families will be here PLUS all the tourists? WOW! This speaks volumes. I say they are doing their thing considering the 'craziness' that happens when a new place as great as Cracker Barrel opens. I understand employees that get overwhelmed and it's busy....stuff happens.

#3: If you DO have to wait, take the time to BROWSE the store. THE STORE IS AMAAAAZING!!! Seriously, not fibbing. You can spend HOURS just in their retail store looking at every interesting item like wood wicked scented candles, Burt's bees entire collection of awesome items, Specialty DAD's Sodas, pancake mix, bacon (have to ask them at the register to get you some from the back), cutest baby clothes & toys, women's clothes, UNLV merchandise, various sports team items, holiday decorations, old school & new school candies, kitchen decor, Yankee candles, & SO MUCH MORE!!! CAN YOU TELL I LOVE THE STORE!!

FOOD: Two menus to choose from: Breakfast OR Lunch & Dinner. I always get both. There are a myriad of items to choose from and although I haven't tried everything, it's always fresh and every location I've tried (Utah, Montana and now Nevada) never disappoint me. My favorites include, (Breakfast) Old Timer's Breakfast or Momma's French Toast and I always have a Biscuit WITH APPLE BUTTER and a side of grits...(Dinner), my fav is the Roast Beef Dinner with a side of OKRA, Mashed Potatoes & Grits (no cheese), can you tell I love grits? Btw, the cornbread is sweet FYI. I will come back later to update this area as I try more and more dishes. The Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes are awesome too! Yum, dessert CHOCOLATE COLA CAKE is UNBELIEVABLE! Wow!

TIP: While you are waiting, sit in a rocker outside on the front porch and look over the ENTIRE MENU. There are so many items on BOTH menus that you need time to look it over, seriously, trust me on this.

Overall, excellent experience. I personally love Cracker Barrel and this particular location is clean, friendly and the food (so far) has been a great for myself and my family. As you can tell by my review, I am a Cracker Barrel fan. They pretty much are all the same but since I live 10 minutes away, this can be dangerous for all of us. There is no such thing as 'portioning' here so I am forced to eat the great food.... Wish me luck and hope our paths cross soon!",2016-08-31 23:34:35

I made a rookie move by attempting to call in my lunch order.  This place does not accept phone orders for the lunch special because it is already prepared. You just walk in, pick your rice, meat and you're done.  The only thing that takes a few minutes is their naan, but it's worth the wait.

Their chicken curry looked more like a soup, so I ordered the butter chicken. It was on the watery side, but still edible.

So, I ordered a negitama gyudon and takoyaki for dinner today. The food arrived super fast. And looked nice at first glance. But upon eating... Boy, what a real disappointment. The food was awful. The rice in my don was mushy and wet/soggy and the gyudon was bland! It not like the rice was wet from the sauce, it was wet from too much water. Like as if a total noob made the rice. To give a better idea, I would say it tasted like I was eating plain congee with overboiled pieces of meat (super rough/dry) that also tasted like nothing. My egg on top had more seasoning than the meat... I could not even finish this meal as everything tasted like bland congee. I would not recommend having any rice dishes here. 

The takoyaki was not the best I've had. But at least there was taste. This place does not have the best takoyaki in toronto. There was too much wet dough in the centre as the takoyaki balls were quite large...as large as golfballs or maybe even larger? So, they were also mishaped and not round. 

Well, I'm glad I have finally tried this place though, now I can finally stop wondering.",2017-02-26 00:29:19

I wasn't sure what I wanted but I was thinking some comfort food and came across this Raijin.  The place looked busy and also looked nice so I decided to drop in.

The hostess sat me by the kitchen by the bench seating.  I had a chance to talk to some of the cooks and had a look over the menu.  Looking around the place I thought it was very nicely decorated.  I heard nothing but Japanese around me which was very cool as that's not always the case in other cities when you're at Japanese restaurants.

I ended up ordering a bowl of ramen with the basics and some fried chicken.  I looked around some more and the place was over 3/4 full and it was close to 11pm mid week.

The fried chicken was solid.  It was slightly dry but wasn't oily which is the worst thing with fried chicken.  I'm pretty sure I could eat a whole fried chicken from here.  The ramen wasn't bad at all.  I found the broth slightly rich but besides that the rest of the bowl was delicious!

Now the eldest daughter is at ASU and we went down to visit on Sat afternoon for lunch and to senior girl. Hubby suggested House of Tricks and I wasn't even sure it was open for lunch. Checked Yelp and it was! AND there was a 20% off if you checked in. AND you could make reservations via Yelp. Decision made. 

We arrived and were given a choice of a table inside or outside. Even though it was going to be well over 100 all of the shade from the beautiful trees and umbrellas and great misting system made us decide outside was the way to go. 

The menu has so many things that sounded wonderful - it was hard for all of us to decide. AND they had both a white and a red wine by the glass for $6. 

I got the salmon which was delicious. Cooked perfectly. Moist and flavorful. Served over a chive risotto cake, bed of mixed greens with cherry tomatoes, avocados and sweet red peppers. Yum!  Daughter opted for the daily special frittata with turkey, feta and tomatoes served with a side salad and a pile of fresh fruit. Another win. Hubby had the club sandwich which was wonderful. He opted for potato salad instead of pasta salad and it has bacon in it. He was very happy with his selection. 

This place did not disappoint. It's $$$ on Yelp but I think that was more for dinner. Our lunch was very reasonable. Especially for finer dining - improved more with the 20% off. We will have to go have a special date night there again soon!

nbqcAXe8N2XimfEnVRGcFg,JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,3,2,4,1,"I gotta hand it to Robert. He saved this place from a 1-star rating. I left him a big tip because of his great personality and customer service.

2 years ago I first came here. I waited about 10 minutes to get a seat even though I was first in line. After they sat me, I waited about 15 minutes for a server to come around. I tried to get the attention of the angry old blonde woman who works behind the cash register and she practically told me to eat a d*ck and get lost. When the server finally showed up, he was one of those  white dudes who speaks in Ebonics. I couldn't understand a word he was trying to tell me.  My food came out around 30 minutes later, and the server never came around to refill my drink. 

Last night I came here for the graveyard special. I expected the same bad service and I was correct in my expectations. It took about 5 minutes for the host to come over and attempt to seat me. The host first took us to a table that still had a half eaten pancake on it. She then tried to seat us at another table that had a person still sitting in it. She then tried to seat us at another table that still had 4 plates, dirty napkins, and bottles of beer on it. Obviously there was something wrong with the host and busers here. She then sat us at a table which was far off in a corner.

Once again like in years past, we waited about 15 minutes for service. As we were waiting for service we could see all the other servers goofing off, laughing, and horse-playing. Two servers were playing tag and slapping each other in the legs while we were just sitting there waiting for someone to at least ask us what we wanted to drink. Something about seeing the workers playing like children and laughing out loud in enjoyment while the customers are miserable and waiting for service is just FUBAR...  I went to that same angry blond old lady at the cashier and she once again gave us a dirty look and practically told us to eat a d*ck and get lost. She hasn't changed at all in the last 2 years. 

Finally, after another 5 minutes there was a series of angry attacks from other guests. One guest starting screaming profanity loudly and began hassling the manager.  A man and woman at a different table got so angry that they threw their menu and utensils on the floor and stormed out while giving the servers the royal finger.  I on the other hand was not that angry because I have lived in Las Vegas for a long time and ALWAYS expect bad service. Bad service is just a normal aspect of Las Vegas life. If I don't get bad service, that's when I am usually most surprised. I just endure the bad service and never leave a  tip. But, things began to turn around. The manager finally noticed that the whole restaurant was about to riot and ran into the kitchen and found a worker who did a great job solving the situation. We got a server named Robert who provided us excellent customer service and also got the manager to comp our meal. He even got our food out extremely fast. I really appreciate his hard work. 

Will I be back? I sure will. I love graveyard specials and am willing to endure the bad service. It actually saves us all money when we get bad service because we don't tip. But, I'm more than happy to tip Robert a 20 if I get him as a server again.",2012-02-07 09:57:46

Breakfast I went with the gamblers special.. super filling that is all i have to say between the eggs, 3 pieces of toast, bacon you name it.. basically for $9.99 it should easily keep your stomach filled up till after lunch time when you start walking Fremont and the Strip. Plus the kicker $10 meal credit on the spin the wheel promotion made it essentially free minus tip to my server which was very friendly. 

Now let's get to the serious part here! Binions famous burger.. I don't know what it was but the bun itself was SUPER GOOD! I kept asking myself damn where do they get this bun from it just compliments this burger so good. All around super good for a cheap lunch I think it was around $6.95 plus add on's put it in the $8-9 mark but super tasty the beef, and jalapenos.  Binions famous burger has it down pat I think it was easily better then most burger places in my years of trying places. My gf also found it good and kept complimenting the taste including the bun!

From the moment we visited this location we were greeted with hospitality, stellar customer service, attentiveness by everyone we encountered. 
Our Saleswoman April really showed care in showing my husband vehicles and was informative about the company, cars, pricing, financing, warranty, service, and never once did we feel pushed into buying a vehicle. We are avid Nissan fans but I have to say this car buying experience exceeded the great  service we received from my Nissan dealer. 
I would recommend you ask for April and by all means they have a liberal referral plan so please reference us if you like. My friend received a nice referral bonus. The finance manager took excellent care of us and really worked with the lenders to find one that would work with us. I was thrilled that Ally was our bank again. 
To be honest every single employee looked happy, engaged in conversation, smiled and spoke well of Kia. 

Pricing- we got got a great deal on a Kia Rio that was fully loaded right from the showroom floor. The vehicle gets excellent gas mileage, car washes for life, minimal service needed, is roomy and run to zip around town in.

The valet here is operated by what seems like children on a bumper car ride at an amusement park.

I used them a while back. When I got back from my vacation, my car was damaged. Some idiot drove right into something and busted the grill and was too cowardly to step up and say they did it. They put the broken piece in the cup holder of my car. 

They gave me the run around, pretending that they would pay to fix it but then they said they couldn't find who damaged it and wouldn't fix it. They made me spend a day getting different quotes for nothing. I had to take unpaid time off work to run around town getting quotes in hopes they would fix it.  

They asked me to sign something saying that they're not liable for the damage and that they could fix it as a courtesy even though they don't need to or some crap like that. Don't sign it! Your insurance won't like it. Your insurance will probably win anyway so you don't need to go through these crooks to fix the damages. It's better you don't sign the sheet they ask you to sign their liability away in order to go through with fixing it. They're dishonest and won't fix it and what you'll have in the end is a busted car and they'll have your signature of you signing off and saying they're not liable. You could still try to fight it if you did sign that because I'm not sure how well that would hold up in court. 

I had to go through insurance and get about $2k worth of damage claimed. Luckily in the end, my insurance company beat their insurance company in court and I was refunded my deductible. 

They're the worst. Don't use their service. If you don't use valet you'll be waiting a long time for a shuttle. If you use valet you'll get a shuttle fairly quickly but might come home to a busted up car. It's cheaper and smarter to take an airport cab.

It is definitely not the hardest hike ever, but there are large rocks and boulders to climb over, loose rocks all over that you need to watch out for, and of course flies and bugs like other hikes. 

If your goal is to see the waterfall then don't go in the summer, it is all dried up, nothing much to see. Definitely check the weather before you decide to go, its about 1 1/2 mile out in the sun then the 1/2 between the mountains so this part is shaded... can get hot pretty quickly when you are going uphill and trying to climb over boulders. But still a great hike for a workout... I feel like this hike is a full body workout, obviously lots of leg work, used my arms and body strength to pull myself up and over large boulders. 

When you get to the base of the waterfall, you will have to climb over two ""walls"" to get to the bottom of the waterfall, not sure if you were supposed to go all the way up there but we did. Since the waterfall was dry I think it was easy for us to climb all the way to the base, not sure it would be possible if the water is flowing. 

MAKE SURE you keep track of the trail, we got lost and went off the trail and took a much more rough trail to get back to the car. You can't literally get lost because there is one way in and one way out, but there are easier paths than others. We pretty much had to climb and craw through branches, trees, bushes... got cuts and scrapes all over because of the plants and the cacti. 

I would recommend going with a friend, especially if it is your first time or you want to climb all the way to the bottom of the waterfall, it is just more safe that way.",2016-06-15 21:26:38

I love coming here and trying another variation of it. It's definitely worth the 30 min drive! Every time I come, I have to double check that my hot dog is a veggie because it's that good. It doesn't even taste vegetarian. I ordered a salad for the side but I enjoy the chips better. The salad had a bit too much dressing for me.

Nothing, however, could have prepared me for THE most luxurious meal I have ever had. The staff, and especially the GM, Ivo Angelov, have always made sure that when I dine at Le Cirque I am treated like a queen. 

When I arrived Tuesday evening, I was again greeted warmly by Ivo. I was led to a corner banquette that would have comfortably seated 4 or 5 people. I told Ivo that I was interested in having some white truffles. I was not given a menu, but started receiving dishes that I would have ordered. Before the parade of luxury, I was presented with a beautiful assortment of breads. I chose the pretzel, the bacon cheddar, and the white chocolate walnut--all were delicious.

My first course was the trio of caviar: smoked salmon rillette wth vodka cream; capellini with poached quail egg, shiso, lemon vinaigrette; kumomoto oyster, Granny Smith Apple, lemon verbena mousse. The dish is presented, and a liquid is poured and smoke rises from the plate (very dramatic!).

Next course was the Fall Salad of baby artichokes, avocado, foie gras snow, jamon iberico, Parmesan, Dijon mustard vinaigrette, and shaved white truffles.

I was thrilled with the next course: gnocchi with white truffles. The best gnocchi anywhere, and with the addition of the white truffles, this dish became my favorite dish of 2014!

Next course was the chilled beet velout√©, goat cheese panna cotta, micro greens, and crostini. I'm not a big fan of beets, but this course made me a convert.

This was followed with the seared diver scallop, potato and Apple brunoise, white truffles, celeriac pur√©e, lobster foam, and white chocolate sauce. Didn't think this would all work, but it did beautifully!

My main course was the Japanese A5 Wagyu kobe striploin, bone marrow fondant, spinach pur√©e, beef tendon croquette, royal trumpet mushrooms and bordelaise sauce. Oh yes, more white truffles! I wound up having beef at each of my dinners, but the best was at Le Cirque.

The pre-dessert was a mojito granite with lime foam-very refreshing.

I specifically requested the souffl√© for dessert since I have long considered the souffl√© at Le Cirque to be the ""gold standard"". The flavor was raspberry-yuzu; I tasted mostly raspberry, and it was delicious!

A tray of mignardises followed, and I ate everyone of them. The last treat was the jewelry box with 2 truffles. I ate only one of them.

Service was, as always, wonderful! It's great to see many of the same staff. Even those staff members not taking care of my table came over to say hello.

When I requested my check, my captain came back with no check, and said my dinner was with the compliments of Le Cirque. I was blown away by such kindness. I left a very generous gratuity for the staff.

Even if I had paid for the dinner, I would still rank it among my top 5 all-time favorite meals.",2014-11-24 12:25:35

It's no lie that I have had this little restaurant tucked away in an old house bookmarked for quite some time now. I had read great reviews and kept meaning to stop by, but for some reason it always slipped my mind. On a recent Tuesday night I decided to drag my husband out of the house and finally try out this little restaurant off 7th Street. Upon our arrival, I noticed that parking was a little scarce, but no big deal, we parked down one of the side streets and walked along the sidewalk to the cute little house The Main Ingredient calls home. We were immediately impressed by the patio that's littered with tables and chairs in front of an old porch. Pretty adorable. We walked in the front door and a young guy immediately informed us that we could choose our own table...don't mind if I do! Being a Tuesday night and all, the place wasn't exactly crowded so we chose a cozy spot in the corner with a hightop table and a TV close by. There was a unique mix of hip-hop-ish music being played that was a refreshing change from most restaurant tunes. We both immediately liked the setup of the restaurant and were excited to try out the menu that had everyone raving.

Unfortunately, the positive experience pretty much ended there. A little while after seating ourselves, a well-dressed, funky server came to take our drink order. Her exact words upon greeting us: ""What would you like to drink?"". I thought that was kind of weird. No ""hello"" or ""how's it going"", just straight to the point without any friendliness. Luckily the guy who brought our waters and ran our food was a little more pleasant. Since this was our first time here, there were multiple menu items we wanted to try out. We started with the chips and salsa which were pretty tasty and by far the best part of our meal. I ordered a Peach Ale and my man went with a Coke. After enjoying our chips and salsa, we were served our main course (which came out pretty quickly so timing wasn't really an issue). Ever since LGO got rid of their green chile mac and cheese I have been seriously searching for a replacement. I was hoping this would be it, but I was horribly disappointed. I have to admit that the mac and cheese was part of my reason for choosing The Main Ingredient that night and it just didn't hit the spot. In fact, it wasn't really mac and cheese at all. The consistency was bready and weird and I sincerely missed the cheesy pasta that makes mac and cheese such an American classic. I get that they're trying to do something different with the dish, but for me it just didn't work. I ate a few bites and definitely didn't ask to take the rest home. No thanks. My husband's meal was slightly better, he ordered the veggie sandwich, but just wasn't anything to write home about. Overall, we were disappointed with the food. For comfort food, it wasn't very comforting...

So after trying out the food, I was convinced they were a three star restaurant. Not horrible, but definitely not a new favorite. But when you throw in the horrendous service we received, their rating has to lose an extra star. After our lack-luster greeting, the service only went downhill from there. My husband sat for 10+ minutes without anything to drink, our server never came to ask how we were enjoying our meal, and our plates sat stacked on our table for more than 15 minutes while we waited for our check. We even watched our server bring other tables their checks while we continued to wait for our own. She wasn't busy waiting on tables, so I guess she was in the back doing something else. Not cool.

So I'm sorry to say this, but I just don't think The Main Ingredient will be added to our list of favorite restaurants around town. With the bad service and the disappointing food, it just doesn't compare to so many other great spots. It's a shame too because the atmosphere and menu really had some great potential. :(",2012-08-23 18:21:42

This place is brand spanking new and is still only open for dinner. Keeping up with that awkward location, the entrance is also awkward with two adjacent glass doors that can, if you wanted to, trap someone in between. It's also a tiny place and can fill up quite quickly.

What drew our attention was the fact that Kyouka was advertised as authentic Japanese ramen. Now I've never had ramen in Japan so I can't speak to that, but I can speak about it as a general consumer. And generally speaking, it's a decent ramen place. The portions are not as large as Sonoya's (Kenzo's) and the service isn't as fast as Sansotei's but it has its own charm. 

Kyouka ($11): You can customize the fat level (original, less fat, no fat). Even with ""less fat"", it was still plenty fat. There were little white pieces of ""flavour"" (some sort of animal fat) floating peacefully on top of the broth. But hey, you didn't come to ramen to keep slim, you came here to feel good with noodles! A friend also went for the spicier option of chili paste for an extra 50 cents and said it wasn't really that much spicier. 

Value for money was meh. Even with the fully loaded option with double toppings (+$4), it's not that fully loaded. I'm not sure it was worth it. The egg was delicious but you only get one full egg in the double topping option (otherwise just half). The meat was also good but you only get one piece of chicken and one piece of chashu in the original. And they're pretty thin pieces. 

Shio ($11): Shio means salt - so a salt based broth. And boy, was it salty. You also don't get to customize the fat level for this one and it looked and felt pretty greasy. Still a tasty ramen, but everything else combined, I think my health would protest against ordering this one again. 

Despite some issues, Kyouka is still a welcome addition to the Markham ramen scene and I can see it becoming popular as it settles into a good routine. Overall, the food isn't bad but it's not at the top of my go-to list. Everything was just a bit more expensive, a bit saltier, and a bit small compared to other options.

The reviews are pretty much on the dot too.  Hokaido has the kind of quality food and fish from a higher-class sushi restaurant--the kind that usually reside on the strip--but have hole-in-the-wall sushi joint prices.  Their list of rolls is pretty impressive and affordable, and the actual entrees are decent too. My cousin and I shared a shrimp tempura roll along with our bento boxes ($7.95 for a kids bento box is a steal by the way) which actually came with a lot of food. I chose the two-item bento box for $11.95 and had some of the best vegetable tempura I've ever had in a Las Vegas sushi place. I'm a big fan of tempura and tend to order it whenever I try a new sushi place and this tempura batter was top-notch.  Much lighter, crispier, and done well but not too well done. No soggy spots and it wasn't dripping in oil either. Pretty much just yum-tastic. 

The spicy tuna roll that came with my bento was okay, I've had far better spicy tuna at Sushi Wa, but this wasn't far off the mark. I think the tuna may have been a little on the ripe side, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. I've noticed that Las Vegas sushi places rarely have the kind of fresh fish I've had at coastal sushi restaurants, which is obvious since we live in a desert. But the spicy factor wasn't too overbearing, which I appreciated since I've been to way too many sushi joints where they over flavor the fish to the point where you can't even tell what kind of fish you're having. 

Overall it was a really great place with really great prices. I hope to return soon to try more of their creative sushi concotions.",2010-03-29 00:21:24

TAi2Gpt6oLp42ekv2sqS9A,tduMSflg1bhAFDgWOr4MPg,WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w,4,5,4,3,"I'm averaging the dayclub (3 stars) and nightclub (5) stars.

Nightclub: I still think Marquee is an awesome club.  I love the fact that they have multiple rooms with different music, and I also love the outdoor pool area.  It's like a mix of the best of XS and Tao.  Cons are still the same: hip-hop room is too crowded & too many stairs.  Lately, they've been hosting a lot of big house DJs, which is fine - though it does push up prices for the fellas.  If I were to get table service, I would probably do it either in the hip-hop room (for the music), or outside in the cabanas (for the view of the strip - wow!).

My main gripe about the nightclub is line security - not always very polite.  Also, I wouldn't try to go to Marquee unless I were in a group of ALL girls or I had table service.  Because Marquee is so popular right now, the mixed group line is utterly ridiculous & the club is not SO amazing that it's worth waiting over half an hour for.  Plus you can't drink in line - not even drinks from the Cosmopolitan!  Marquee is pretty great, but there are other great clubs in Vegas too.  If you get there late and have to wait in the general admission / guest list line (even with comp passes) and if you can see the big shoe statues...dude, just save yourself the trouble and try a different club.

My recommendation is either:
1) Go with a group of all girls and enter from the ""all-girls line"" (upstairs)... or try to talk your way in with a host, whichever works
2) Book a table or cabana
3) If you must go with a mixed group, get there no later than 10pm.  Real talk.

Dayclub: Not worth it unless you have a cabana.  They usually have house DJs, so the music is OK for the most part.  The pool is decently sized, but it's too crowded to enjoy unless you have your own place to sit.  Also watch out for your stuff; my friend's wallet got lifted at the dayclub & the staff were pretty useless in helping us find it.",2011-08-11 00:44:22

Seeing as we were seeing a movie, the staff was quick to take our order and the food came out pretty fast.  I'd have to agree with the comments regarding the owner's abrupt style.  It was a little intimidating, but in the end good food and fast service wins.

We all shared a couple pizzas... the garlic margarita and a sausage.  I loved both, and particularly enjoy when the sausage is crumbled instead of in chunks, so their pizza was spot on.  The garlic pizza was garlicky for sure... they don't skimp.  We also had a pasta, which the owner specially made for us.  I believe it had lamb sausage on it and it was in a tomato sauce with pappardelle noodles.  It was pretty darn good.

I read all these reviews and write-ups of the place so my expectations were high. We were a party of 4 and sat upstairs. The downstairs is a bar and tables of 2 that are totally crammed too close together. This is not NYC; this is the suburbs of Charlotte! So let's have some breathing room between you and the other diners as I don't want to be sitting so close to them that I can eat off their table! 

The milk bread- supposedly all the rave. It's not milk, bread, or milky bread. It's this gluey mess that looks looks like a poor cousin to a popover. After I ate it I felt sick. 

Dinner- the menu is very small, limited, and tries too hard. They were pairing things that simply don't belong together. My friend got the miso soup and said 'this tastes weird'. How can you screw up a broth soup? If you are going to have some 'adventurous' items, you need to have some tried and true standard items that you know will sell. I had the duck fat fries- just not that good so don't even bother. At least the food has fresh ingredients. 

Other- the bathroom on the second floor. It is one room that has its door open into the restaurant. The door knob is old with an even older tiny lock.

The staff has always been great EXCEPT the hostesses are the worst ever on the strip.  I have been here many times, and the worst time I had was when I went with my coworkers.  We all work at a day club and it was just girls.  I understand that Cosmopolitan has the worst problem anywhere on the strip with escorts, but I don't think us girls look remotely like escorts, but the Holstein hostesses sure treated us like we were unwelcome guests of theirs.  A couple girls came late to dinner and filtered in, and each time the hostesses at the front door INSISTED that there was no party of ours in the back of the place despite us texting our girlfriends that we were inside.  This happened three times that the hostesses would not even let the girls walk to the back to find us.  Seriously the hostess would not let the girl walk in to Holsteins to find our party.  I couldn't believe it.  Most places in Las Vegas LOVE having pretty girls around and usually will even pay to have pretty girls in places or pay for their dinners.  The hostesses here acted like we were hookers or something instead.  When we complained to our server each time this happened she didn't know what to do or how to handle the situation.  She never got a manager and being servers ourselves we didn't insist.  We liked our waitress so we didn't want to be too fussy.

The dishes, when brought out, look so nice you almost feel bad eating it (Well, almost).   In almost every dish, there is a blending of East meets West which makes each meal unique.

For example, our amuse-bouche was an avant-garde interpretation of pepperoni pizza.  In a shot glass, you have a basil-tomato type puree with basil foam on top, and a singular slice of Chinese sausage (or Chinese pepperoni, as they call it).  For the ""crust,"" a thin cracker stick is laid on top of the glass.  I was apprehensive because I've never really tried to imbibe my pizza before, but it actually had a quite pleasing taste that did remind me of a pepperoni pizza.  

The Pepsi shrimp appetizers were delicious, and I tried some of the sesame chicken and had the chicken trio.  The sesame chicken, as stated by my husband, is the best sesame chicken he's every had.  Tender chicken, crisp batter, and a delicious sauce.  I appreciated the idea of the chicken trio, and it was beautifully presented, but for me I probably won't be ordering this again.  Compared to the other two types of chicken in this dish- a 5-spice marinated drumstick and pesto-topped chicken breast, the stuffing and chicken in the ""chicken cheesecake"" seemed mismatched due to its heavy taste.

Dessert was superb.  The 14-layer chocolate cake was very light and not overly sweet.

In general, this is a great place to have a nice dinner. The entrees are very reasonably priced for the quality of food that you get, and the atmosphere makes you forget that you are actually in a restaurant that is part of a mall.

I hate being cramped into a small confined area at a small venue or lost in a sea of random strangers at a large one. The Fillmore is the perfect size, and allows those who want to rush the stage an up close and personal experience while others can hang out at the back and not worry about getting jostled or moshed about, but still get that intimate experience.

We've attended two shows at The Fillmore so far, and have tickets to attend another show in February. Parking isn't too bad, as there are several larger lots that are not far from the venue at all (next to that weird diner across the street.) The venue itself is perfectly sized, where it's not too big where you're squinting to see the band on stage and not too small where the entire general admission area turns into a hectic mosh pit. As I said, my wife and I like to hang out towards the back away from the crazys where we can relax and get lost in the music without having to worry about getting kicked in the head from a crowd surfer. 

The prices for tickets is pretty reasonable, so no complaints there. Of course I will complain about the price of beverages (beer and water both) but that's to be expected at any venue...they will always gouge consumers at the concession stand where they can make the most profit. I also have to say that the rest rooms are ample with plenty of room, and they stayed clean throughout the show. Kudos to whoever keeps going in there to maintain them.

All in all, The Fillmore is a great way to see some of your favorite bands. We've seen New Found Glory, Alkaline Trio and Yellowcard here so far...none of these bands are slouches and have some national appeal. The fact that The Fillmore is large enough to comfortably accommodate fans while not cramming said fans into a tight area goes to show why it is a superior venue for crooning along with some of your favorites. I just recommend becoming a camel and stocking up some water in your hump before going in, or expect to pay $8 for a cup of water.",2014-01-12 00:24:02

This list changes constantly with all the spots changing from time to time, new places added, some places missing the mark and taken off, and some unfortunately fade into obscurity or closing down. All that being said, only one single restaurant has remained at the top of this list for nearly 5 years now, and as long as they keep the experience at the level it is now, I don't see it dropping off anytime soon. Welcome to the Cowfish!

First things first, if you are dropping by for dinner anytime between Friday thru Sunday, be prepared for a wait. The bar is first come first served with full menu service and bartenders who are as knowledgeable about the menu as they are of the artisan drinks and cocktails they craft at ludicrous speed. Don't be afraid to flag one of them down, their pace is somewhat intimidating but they are actually very patient and happy to help!

That being said, in my opinion the best way to experience the cowfish is with a group of friends either in a booth or on the patio (covered, and heated in the cooler months). The menu is a bit daunting for a first timer. The decor inside is very trendy and modern, with the canvas artwork all commissioned by a local artist. Make sure you take the time to walk the restaurant before you leave, the left side of the place has a hilarious cubism panoramic painting.

I definitely recommend you ask your waiter any questions, these people really know their stuff. I can only imagine that during training as a staff member here you must try everything and study for the Burgushi 101 final exam. Keep this in mind if the colossal menu overwhelms you, the staff is very good at narrowing things down. Even with as many times that I've been here I alway ask my server what his/her favorite dish is, or if there's anything new that they'd suggest. If you're a first timer, you really can't go wrong with anything they'd recommend (assuming you let them know of any allergies, and 'fundamental' dislikes).

As far as the food goes... where do I begin? How about appetizers! Looking for something a bit hearty? Go for the Crab Rangoon Dip. Forget the little smushed wonton version you're used to at Chinese take out joints, this interpretation kicks it up a notch with real crab and a nice sweet chili sauce drizzled over freshly fried wonton chips. Another favorite is the parmesan truffle fries, very rich and very filling; make sure you bring some friends to help you conquer the mountain of fries you get. Now, my absolute favorite app is the Blackened tuna nachos. You're going to look at the menu and see it's over $10 for a mere 5 wonton chips with some Tuna, guac, and greens, but I could die right there with no regrets after a plate of them. Trust me on this, it's worth every penny.

Entrees are an easy decision for me. I ask my server for suggestions and barring anything new I have about a half-dozen go-to dishes. On the burgushi side the prime time is an all-time favorite. Lobster/veggies inside, filet mignon and chipotle sauce outside, with paper-thin portabella mushrooms and green onions on top. It's love at first sight. These guys make a mean burger as well. One of the more 'fun' dishes on the menu is the ""Hunka-Hunka"" burger which has peanut butter, fried banana, and bacon on it. I was very reluctant ordering it at first, but i'll be damned if the flavor profile was, dare I say, dynamic and oddly delicious. I guess The King knew his flavor affinities!!

I have one and only one suggestion for dessert if you are ordering for the first time. The Mousse is Loose: Alternating layers of brownie, chocolate mousse, and vanilla mousse. Need I say more? Don't let anyone talk you out of ordering it. Sometimes, when I'm done with this dessert and I'm sure no one is looking, I'll take the plate and lick it clean. If someone were ever to see me I would just look at them and say ""I regret nothing!""

To summarize this really really long rant of awesome people who make awesome food, I am really looking forward to many many more visits to the Cowfish. From birthdays, to seeing out-of-town friends, to Arbor Day, any day is a good excuse for Burgushi!!


PS: To those who complain about the parking: This isn't foolproof, but as you pass the restaurant and go underneath the apartment building, instead of going into the parking desk, keep right (normally you can see the Cowfish 'party bus' as soon as you emerge from the apartment's 'tunnel') and there is usually some parking over there that seems to be commonly overlooked. Take note of any marked spots (there are a couple with signs saying Parking for 'x' only) as many businesses and residents are in this complex and you'd likely get towed quickly for parking where you aren't supposed to. If this doesn't work, just park in the deck and walk a little, it's good for you!",2017-05-06 00:59:56

Maybe offer a sample, instead of offering a $20 beer tasting tray.  I asked for a hefeweizen type beer and I ended up getting something that was close to a yuengling

296ut8YXnK9VZ_fcCx6XIA,leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,cbdg2vJ6vM6Vq2EaJkpNCQ,1,0,0,0,"I am updating this review a couple of days later being that I received a response from the veterinarians at the hospital: I would strongly hope that they learn from this experience. 
Firstly, I understand, being in the medical profession, when we aren't sure what we are seeing because we do not have experience in that field. Yet, when I see something that I am not familiar with, I don't wait. I call the specialist's office myself and get the patient in right away and I most certainly do not tell the client/patient that the situation is not urgent. That completely changes the focus of that individual in getting to the specialist in a quicker fashion. There was failure to provide proper informed consent about the dangers of this condition and what could potentially happen if this condition is not treated in a timely fashion. The reason there was failure is that the notes, which I reviewed recently, claimed a diagnosis of herpes simplex keratitis, but I was never told that. I was told that there may be bacteria and we are going to treat a bacterial infection. I got the earliest appointment I could with ophthalmology. Had I been told to get in to see the ophthalmologist as soon as possible, as that veterinarian claims they are not an ophthalmologist and isn't sure what that could be, I would have waited in the ophthalmology waiting room with my cat as a walk in. With all due respect, I would not expect a general veterinarian to have the same knowledge as an ophthalmologist would, but I would expect them to know of possible concerns or outcomes with these types of conditions, and therefore understand the urgency of a matter at that time, or inform me of possible complications as such. After reading about herpes simplex keratitis, it can cause some significant complications and I wish I was told clearly what they were thinking, as it was never mentioned.
Furthermore, the day of here teeth cleaning, I did mention the eye and it was briefly seen by the veterinarian, although she was there for teeth cleaning, and I did explain when she will be seeing the ophthalmologist to them and the date of the visit, but I guess they don't remember that. I remember the veterinarian saying that the ophthalmologist was very good. I knew she was there for teeth cleaning, so what else could I do on that day but wait for the ophthalmologist? I also, in the notes, saw that that the veterinarian who cleaned her teeth documented that her eye was perfectly normal. I am sure that that was an oversight on their part, yet the eye was not normal. 
I did quite a bit of research and spoke to several veterinarians before making a decision to write this review. I may have called to speak to Boca Park animal hospital, but that does not mean that I'm OK with the outcome. I am not a veterinarian and I will not pretend to be one. I spoke to several veterinarians, read articles on the condition, and learned as much as I could to understand the condition, as it was never explained to me as even a potential diagnosis until I saw the ophthalmologist.
Finally, I don't think that they understand why I chose to put a new review into yelp. One of their front desk personnel, who I am told is no longer there, placed a note into the patient's medical chart, which had nothing to do with my cat's medical issues that day, and it is in the chart as part of the medical record, which is not appropriate. I have witnesses who were with me that day and they were completely beside themselves when I told them what was documented. I did discuss this with the owner. 
Am I frustrated by the fact that I felt the veterinarian should've been clearer about the diagnosis and not told me that it's not urgent? Of course I am. Yet to see a note in the chart, from someone at the front desk, who has no business documenting anything on a medical chart, placing a scenario that was false, as it never happened, into the chart to their advantage, is not good. I do not want to continue with this clinic because I cannot trust this office after that. That is why I chose to put in a review and something like this only deserves one star. I do not believe in altercations and was not interested in having an argument with anyone that I spoke to on the phone. I felt that documenting my experience was most appropriate as I do not want to take this any further than this review.
I appreciate the responses, but it does not change the fact that there was a lack of proper information/informed consent, lack of urgency, and other concerning issues as already mentioned above. The veterinarians here are all very nice people. I am not surprised they have a lot of clients that are loyal to them and that love them. I also have no doubt that they will be successful no matter what. Yet after my recent experiences, I plan on a different office that I can trust for the care of me pets.",2018-04-19 04:31:28

The write up in the newspaper indicated a desire to introduce Pittsburgh to French comfort food in a way that was less pretentious and more affordable than what many often think when they hear ""French Restaurant.""  

The renovated space still reminds me of Sonoma, however the large open air space in the front of the restaurant was welcomed improvement as we snagged a high top table in the bar so we could still listen to the jazz music from the festival outside.  There was a decent crowd at the bar, but we had no trouble getting a seat at 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  We opted for the bar menu, and were immediately drawn to the table-side cheese plate, as well as a beautiful shrimp tartine that was full of flavor and perfectly presented.  On the cheese plate we could select up to five cheeses ($18) from the selection of six presented two us, with additional accompaniments including pistachios, blueberries, and a fruit jam that was heavenly.  The cheese options were mostly soft cheeses, with two different goat cheeses, brie, blue, and a mild cheddar-like option.  I'm not sure if the cheeses change seasonally, but my preference would be to offer one goat cheese and then opt for something completely different...it seemed a little heavy on the soft cheese this particular day.  Both my parents were pleased with the wine list, and I opted for a champagne and pomegranate cocktail that was the perfect blend of bubbles and sweetness.  Overall we were very pleased with our food and drink selections and loved people watching in the cultural district on a fun summery night!  So why you ask did I only give this establishment 3 stars??  Because despite our best effort to engage with and be patient with our server, he was quite possibly the least personable, most unhappy person I've seen in the service industry in Pittsburgh in a LONG time.  When I tell you there was no smiling, minimal eye contact, abrupt ""Do you know what you want?"" and descriptions of the cheeses included, ""This one just pretty much tastes like milk to me,"" I'm not exaggerating.  We tried repeatedly to give him the benefit of the doubt that perhaps he had a tough table earlier, or was just having a bad day, but despite our every attempt to be friendly and patient, he wasn't having it.  It was an unfortunate circumstance because with so many great chefs, bartenders and servers in the city these days, half the fun is getting to know them and then returning to see a familiar face.  That wasn't our experience this time, but we won't rule out Le Lyonnais for a future visit...I just hope the next time we order that cheese tray the person who comes to our table is a little happier to be there :)",2017-06-23 18:18:21

Chrissy, Dottsy, Mike and I stopped by Pure (per the recommendation of my boss) on a Saturday evening at 645PM. The restaurant was nearly empty; apparently posh scottsdalites like to eat at 9PM. We slid into a booth just across from the chef's workspace and pondered the immense menu for a while. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks ordered while we decided. Finally, delusional from hunger, Mike whispered the magic words, sending Dottsy and I into ecstasy: chef's choice. 

The Chef was feeling effusive that evening and we were quickly served a 2 foot long serving plate of sashimi loaded with halibut, octopus, tuna, scallop, and salmon. Everything was so fresh I swear I could see it twitching. Just moments later a *massive* platter arrived with six rolls.  I cannot remember the details of each roll, but suffice it to say everything was unique and perfectly crafted. I didn't use a single drop of soy sauce the whole night it was so delicious. 

Somehow, after all that, we wanted more, and the chef brought out three more rolls, one of which was baked and topped with gorgeous mushrooms in a tangy sweet brown sauce. Our server commented that none of these rolls were on the menu, just something the chef thought up. We were also served dessert which we attempted halfheartedly, as we were now full to the brim on aquatic delicacies. 

I didn't see the bill, so I can't speak to the pricing, but the meal was everything I could have dreamt of in a sushi feast, so for special occasions (those happen weekly, right?) I will definitely make my way back to Pure.",2009-09-09 22:25:05

Although a new location just opened on The Strip, I found the parking situation to be much easier to navigate in Summerlin. My intrigue began almost a month ago when Blue Ribbon promoted a sandwich called The Smorgasbird - a double decker chicken sandwich stuffed with fries, barbecue chicken, grilled pineapple and sauce at a nice price point of $15. 

The challenge was to finish the bird within 5 minutes and to challenge other friends to do the same to be entered to win a free Hail Mary platter (that's 25 whole wings, 25 tenders, and a side). To sweeten the dean, $5 of that goes to the National MS Society, plus you get your choice of a free shirt or hat. It was win, win win, so I went for it. 

I skipped out on the actual binging challenge and split it with my sister. The chicken itself was good, but in the hodgepodge of different types of food all mixed together, individual flavors were difficult to discern. I did enjoy the skinny cut fries that they had. If you're feeling adventurous, try the chef's choice, beak to butt. While it wasn't for me, it's nice to see that no part of the bird is wasted and you can enjoy parts that some may see as delicacies such as the heart or gizzard. 

Overall, I found the chicken to be tender and juicy, but I'll have to try the original sandwich as well as the individual pieces. I love that they have different types of honey including spicy wasabi, which gives it an extra kick. I found the prices to be very reasonable, especially if you're coming for lunch and can grab lunchbox special for $8. The sweet honey tea is great, without being overly sweetened.",2017-08-01 21:20:15

I went on a Friday evening so it was quite lively but we were able to get seated inside pretty quickly. Nothing noteworthy about the ambiance and the crowd definitely leans toward a younger, hipster-esque crowd. The person I was with kept commenting on how it was hard to tell who was an employee and who was a patron. Indeed a tad disconcerting and also makes it difficult to know who to ask for service.

As for the food? Of the 5 tacos we ordered, 1.5 were enjoyable. One we left untouched, one was delicious, and the others were decent but nothing to write home about. The guacamole, however, was great.

It says $11.00 on the takeout menu, so I'm not sure if they reduced their price to compete with Tandoori Flame.  This is a very competitive area for Indian Fusion food with both Avani and Tandoori Flame around the corner.  Guru's is very similar to Bukhara on Burhamthorpe as it's a mix of Indian and Hakka Chinese.  Had this been my first visit, I would have given it 5 stars, but I have to consider my last review (mediocre at best) as well in the star rating.  

Pros: Amazing butter chicken, goat curry is fall off the bone, tandoori chicken isn't too spicy and not burnt, fresh fruits and some Hakka food as well (chow mein, fried rice, , spring rolls and pakora). Also, good selection of stir fry veggies and potatoes.

Cons: Nothing really, except they only have 15-20 selection of hot food for their buffet, but it's better than too many choices with poor quality.  Also, they constantly fill up your water to make you full (not really a con) lol.  

Average things: Naan.  It's okay, but nothing special.

The broth was perfectly balanced and didn't feel too rich or over-salted.  I ordered the Tonkotsu Sho-yu but now looking at the pictures on the menu I think I got just the regular Tonkotsu.  

Just goes to Sho-yu that I don't know what Sho-yu means.  Yup, I took it there.  What now?  Anyway, from the broth to the meat, and the plethora of sprouts, this was an extremely satisfying bowl.

I'd say the ramen here beats Ajisen further down on Yonge, but Ajisen has much more variety.  If you're craving the staples done well, come here.  

I also had an order of Gyoza, which made it way too much food for one person.  The Gyoza was also well executed and had a surprisingly nice flavor.

The dining area is beautifully decorated and they also have an adorable outdoor space in which it would be lovely to enjoy a meal on a nice day (it was a tad chilly when we went, so we opted to dine indoors).

There was one waitress and while she was a little stoic in demeanor, she was perfectly polite and very attentive. We started with the pilaki appetizer, which were pinto beans, tomatoes, onions and garlic with olive oil. It was served with a round of pita bread. It was really delicious! The beans were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. The pita bread was probably the best I've ever had...the perfect level of soft and fluffy. I wish they would've given more than one pita round though, as we had a lot of extra pilaki and would have liked to have eaten it with more bread (and especially considering the price, it seems like they can spare more than one pita round).

For dinner, my husband ordered the doner (gyro) kabob, which was sliced pieces of lamb served with white rice and cacik (yogurt sauce). He reported that the meat was tender and well-seasoned and the cacik was a perfect complement to his meal. For myself, I got the chicken kabob with rice and bulgur pilaf (subbed for fries, which seems like an odd side dish to serve with Turkish food). The chicken was very flavorful, although a bit dry. The portion of rice and bulgur were very generous, but a bit bland (rice, of course, is usually bland, but I had higher hopes for the pilaf). I stole a bit of my husband's cacik and mixed it into my meal, and it improved the flavor tremendously. Next time I'll order some of my own. 

Overall, the food is made fresh and it's much healthier than traditional restaurant offerings, and I'm a fan of that. However, in terms of taste, it was a mixed bag. And prices are high. Considering all of that, I'd say it was a 3.5 star meal. I'd definitely return at some point, but it's not somewhere that I'm going to rush back to.",2016-05-12 15:45:05

My buddy's breakfast sandwich looked plain and tasted alright. Our sandwiches were $8.00 and it was tasty. My sandwich was reasonably priced but the breakfast wrap wasn't really worth it.

I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. So the fries, meh. I could do without those. Funny, it seems difficult to find a place that has great burgers AND fries. I mean come on, you can't really enjoy one without the other. Am I right? Before my visit, I scrolled through some pictures on yelp I noticed the thick cut fries. Mama like!

We decided to come here since it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they were participating with a fixed price $30 3 course meal.  I had made reservations and when I arrived I was greeted with a welcome back and also a welcome to dinner for the first time.  Apparently they keep track of my open table account from which I make reservations which is both cool and creepy at the same time.

The dinner for all 3 of us started out with the Lobster Bisque which we ordered in addition to the three course menu.  The bisque came out and had a nice orange color and was both creamy and delicious.  For my appetizer I decided to start off with the Pork Belly.  The pork belly came out on top of a bed of roasted corn puree with onions.  The meat was fatty and savory as expected with the puree adding some body to the appetizer while the onions provided a little of the needed tartness for the dish.  When eaten all together the whole dish tasted very good.  Even though I am generally not a big fish person I decided to have the pan roasted golden trout for my entree since my only other option on the price fixed menu was chicken thighs and I hate chicken on the bone more than fish.  The trout came with the skin on and was placed on top of a bed of purple potatoes, eggplant and collard greens all of which was surrounded by a circling of vinaigrette.  It was quite the beautiful dish visually.  I thought the the fish was decent with the standout portion of it being the skin which was crisped nicely and almost had the feel and taste of a potato chip.  The vegetables were also good, especially when combined with some of the added sauce.  My dessert was a dish that was appropriately named Strawberries n'at.  It consisted of a strawberry streusel bar topped with strawberry ice cream beside fresh strawberries with strawberry meringue shards.  I enjoyed it, especially with all of the different textures at play between the coldness of the ice cream, to the juiciness of the strawberries and the slightly crunchy meringue.  It ended up being a lot of strawberry by the end but I still happily cleaned my plate.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Granted I would not order the same meal but the chef clearly knows what he is doing and has enough whimsical and well thought out dishes that I would like to come back.",2012-08-23 19:51:17

I came here last night to use the comp and see the place before it closes and is reopened under the Clique Hospitality Group in February. Hence, this review will make no difference in the Yelp world as the place will be closing as it is soon.  I was at Mercadito for a Yelp event when it first opened, but it was a small tasting of tacos and guacamole.

Service was excellent!  Tyler was on the ball and was very good at making suggestions or answering questions.  Given that I generally don't get tacos in a restaurant like this, I looked on the menu for other items.  I got the tortilla soup for a starter followed by Pollo a las brasas--Peruvian in origin--for the main course.  The tortilla coup was quite good with lots of chicken, some tortilla strips but not overwhelmed with them like some other places.  I ordered a half order of the chicken which ended up being four pieces of chicken--bone in--with a wonderful spicy coating.  It's appearance is why they refer to it as blackened chicken.  The chicken was served with rice and a side of black beans with cotija cheese.

When it came to dessert, Tyler showed me the three item menu and said that the torrejas de bolillo was his favorite and he described it as a kind of Mexican bread pudding.  That's what I ordered and I was glad I did.  Rough cubes of Mexican bread soaked in cr√®me anglaise with cajeta sauce and a scoop of ice cream.  The bread was baked in a cast iron round container.  It was a good way to end the meal.

They also have some great pre-made dishes that are easy to make (microwave) and taste pretty good. They also have a decent amount of vegan and gluten free products, and foreign sections (Asian, English, Indian, Kosher).
Down sides: Watch what you buy- look at the expiration date, many, MANY times we have grabbed something that was going to expire the next, or was already expired (sometimes even MONTHS over expiration date). They have sections where these items are SUPPOSE to go, at a discounted price. But they don't always make it, so you are left to check. Items we have found over expiration date: organic jam (three months expired- so expired that they had already changed the label to a different graphic) trail mix (two months expired) strawberries 1lb (one day over expiration date, and moldy). Or they have things that don't have an expiration date on it. Seriously, go to the English section and find the onion soup. No date. 
Employees can be brash and may ignore you. My boyfriend has had the worst experience with many- from employees following him around the store like he was going to shop lift, to not coming to the machine when it asks for an employee. When they had the peanut butter recall he brought in his label (he'd already eaten the peanut butter by the time he found out) and asked for his refund. The employee said, ""Well, I will take it, but it looks like an old label."" What? What does that have to do with ANYTHING!? Is he a label connoisseur? Does he spend hours studying subtle label tellings? Their peanut butter was TAINTED and they had a RECALL! It's not like he kept the label for years, for just this moment.
The discounted items- they may not really be discounted. We have rung up items, and they would come up at the usual price, not the price they were currently labeled as.
The machines- Horrible. One machine, when my boyfriend scanned organic salad, came up with ""Sensational dish"" for three dollars more. Um, how did this happen? No one could tell us.

So I went enthusiastically to try this place. A bit snotty - quite empty but they made a show of giving us a table at 5 pm without reservations. The complimentary garlic naan is appreciated and is a nice touch as someone else mentioned.

The Delhi style chili chicken was tasty, but the lamb karhai style was just ok. They lacked spice punch entirely, despite 3 chilli signs next to these items. Not suited to an Indian palette at all, and not for you if you're looking for authenticity. But the chili chicken was creative for sure - something I look for in a contemporary high end restaurant. Indian mains served with naan have to have more curry/gravy - that's how we Indians like to dip our naans and rotis. But these were a lot more dry and not fun with naan or roti.

Expensive for what it was, but fine dining Indian style for sure. However, it lacked the little touches that Indian food presents culturally - fennel seeds in creative sugary casings to clear the palette.

I really didn't know what to expect because honestly, we needed a good place to eat in Lake Wylie BAD so I thought maybe it was mediocre but the best of the area based on the competition. I was wrong.
As I say in many of my reviews, I base the review on what it is 'supposed to be'.  Copper is not fine dining, it is very good casual dining. Our visit started out a wee bit rough as after we were seated outside on the patio (our request, weather was perfect), it was well over 10 minutes before anyone came by or took our drink order.  A waitress that wasn't even handling our section (later found out it was Belinda - super sweet girl), came over and asked if anyone had waited on us and took our drink and app order and apologized for our wait. While she was getting our drinks, another girl showed up (apparently who should have showed up 15 minutes earlier) and we told her someone already took our order.  Belinda was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu and offered suggestions when asked based on what she liked, which is what I want to hear from the wait staff at any establishment. She gave genuine glowing reviews of some of her favorites which just made us want to try them more! The menu had a variety of enticing selections, which we will be back to try in the near future.

I also want to mention - this may be odd - but if you eat al fresco at a lot of restaurants the seating is at best wobbly and uncomfortable unless you are a child.  The seating outside is VERY comfortable - the chairs fit well under the table and were way better than the resin plastic fair or broken down outdoor stools you get at a lot of places (hint hint, down the street on the water...)

We had the 'Redneck Egg Roll' appetizer - collard greens and Tasso ham in an egg roll with two dipping sauces - a tangy cream sauce as well as a sweet chili sauce.  Both were very good and the egg rolls were cooked perfectly.  We really enjoyed this app and would definitely order it again.

I ordered the crab cakes and fried green tomatoes.  Let me preface by saying I have had some of the best crab cakes in Maryland, as well as in a 5-star restaurant in LA.  So these were not the best I have ever had, which would be nearly impossible outside of Maryland, but as far as the Carolina Piedmont, they probably were the best I have had.  They had plenty of crabmeat and were huge portions.  So much so that I could not finish the dish.  The fried green tomatoes were also good, they had a corn relish and goat cheese - loved that.  My bf had shrimp and grits, also a rather risky choice at a new place for a southerner because not everybody does them right.  They were very good - the right amount of andouille sausage, spice (not too much and not too little) and good-sized shrimp.  He loved it.  I liked it - I would have liked the grits to have been that more super-creamy style, I guess they are stone ground or something?  At any rate, the dish was very good.

We were just out for a bite, didn't imbibe on any spirits, wine or beer but the bar was inviting and there was a little biergarten complete with a big grassy area where they were going to set up gaming.  The patio had a corn-hole area and there was a dad playing with his kids there and a couple kids were running around in the grassy area.  Just right to be able to watch them and not have them bother other diners; as long as it doesn't get overrun with kids to the point of ruining others' dining experience, I think it is great.  I really liked the whole remodel and set-up.

So glad you are in Lake Wylie, we will be back!

Update: I've seen and heard many bad things about the owners, the way the behave in front of and towards guests... not cool. The most recent time we visited, we did feel annoyed by some overly comfortable/haughty wannabes at the end of the bar (close to entrance). Not sure if that's who that was but they appeared to be on the 'ins' with the establishment. I was watching because outside the older man standing and making himself heard/known, one girl was pregnant and I was hoping she wasn't drinking. 

Will still try it again but hopefully these people don't ruin their own place by only catering to their redneck wannabe friends and really create a customer-service driven atmosphere. Again, thus far we've enjoyed it; just disheartened and these varied disparaging comments about the owners' crass rudeness to some guests.",2016-10-04 19:51:12

Be prepared to line up over 20 minutes and not even have a seat to sit and enjoy your bubble tea.

The turnover is very high here. There's new employees every other week. They all look like they're slaves chain to the counter to keep mass producing bubble tea. They have a huge attitude problem every time. The employees look miserable !  

Nothing turns me off more at a store than rude and slow employees!


The only reason I come here is because of location. But since the past months, quality has gone down significantly. I rather go to another bubble tea location.",2017-03-21 07:49:02

There are so many dealership options all mostly offering the same pushy salesman approach, but I don't get this feeling when coming to Carmax making this my first stop when searching for a new vehicle.   

I really appreciated Bill on this visit, who was very patient and did not push a sale on me but instead wanted me to be comfortable making a decision when I was well and ready.

The place can be fairly crowded which can be a good sign but makes selections a hit or miss.  This is also understandable since most if not all of their inventory consists of pre-owned cars of all makes and models so they don't always know what they are getting added to their inventory or what is coming out.  Their website can also be very helpful as it allows you to view specific categories and price ranges and they also advertise that you may  request a particular car to be transported to a nearby location for free if within 250 miles. 

On this trip I found nothing to my liking within my budget which is no fault of theirs but I was really surprised having been here in the past that their pricing was quite high for even 2010-2012 models.   It left me feeling like I could get a new car for some of the pricing they had.  

My experience today may have encouraged the thought and consideration of other well-known name dealerships with their promotions and incentives for a new car instead.",2014-11-01 02:40:15

I suggested it to my boyfriend and he seemed pretty interested, so we came. We came on a thursday, but it was still pretty crowded. Luckily for us, we came fairly early, so we got a table immediately. 

The back of my chair was touching the chair of the person sitting behind me and it was almost impossible for people to pass between tables. 

We ordered the lamb and corriander as well as the traditional pork. 

We ate the lamb first and it was quite yummy! I was pretty happy with the flavour. 
However, the pork was rather bland and didn't really taste like anything. That was quite a let down.

Another thing that dissapointed me was the fact that the skin kept breaking. The entire point of xiaolongbao is to have that nice broth. If the skin breaks, the broth is obviously going to run out. 

The staff was okay. They worked quickly, but they seemed a little hectic, which made me feel rushed. 

When it came time to pay, we had to go to the register, which I don't mind at all. However, because there's no real line, the customers seemed confused and there was inadvertent line cutting. 

The meal was fairly cheap though. 10 xiaolongbao came to 9 or 10$. 

Overall, I was pretty dissapointed. The skin breaking, the bland pork, the cramped space and feeling rushed made my entire dining experience less than great. However, I will proably go back at some point to try it out again to see if I get a better experience.",2017-11-22 14:35:08

We arrived around 4:00 ish The first thing that was nice was that we didn't have to pay for parking even though we didn't have our passes yet. We just told the parking attendant that we were gold pass members and that we were going to pick up our passes, she let us right in and said we didn't have to pay! We were also able to get front row parking at 4:00! There was not a line to pick up our passes and my husband forgot the credit card that he purchased the passes with, but they were super friendly and it wasn't a problem! 

Once inside the park we were able to find a nice spot in the grass to lay out our towels and then we were off! All of the lines moved pretty quick overall. The longest line we waited in was the line for the Rattler, but it was well worth the wait! This was the best ride by far and it was fun because my whole family got to ride together! 

Splash Island was great too because there are lots of little slides that my kids were able to ride by themselves, while my husband and I went on the Royal Flush. Now, before you think I am a crazy nut job of a mother, my kids are 9 and 7 and they stay together and they have a crap ton of life guards out there! Plus there aren't any actual pools on Splash Island so all my kids could do was go down the slides and squirt the water guns. 

Despite a lot of people complaining about the park being too small, I felt that it was great for what it was. My family had a great time and we bought our season passes for our kids to enjoy themselves, which they totally did!! We will certainly be back many times this summer! My kids haven't stopped talking about today and they can't wait to go back!",2013-06-02 04:40:09

This is a couple miles from our house in the Kierland Commons area which is always nice and well kept. 

Certainly our late night go to restaurant since it is open late and such a nice high quality clean safe place.

One of the most complete menus, the selection is almost to much to choose from the large novel. 

When coming in late I enjoy the ""Create your Omelet"". Always prepared well and the potatoes and toast is a full plate of food.

The service is always outstanding and there maybe a lot of people waiting but they get you in quickly. 

The decor is quirky if you like being in somewhere in Egypt but it is fun. The only issue is it is too dark where you could barely read the menu. 

Will come back again and again not only for late night but for lunch and dinner.",2014-08-16 15:05:05
