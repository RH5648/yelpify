It's a simple local restaurant that makes amazing dumplings and a mean skewer of lamb. The menu is easy to navigate since it has both english and chinese translations. Check off what you want and submit it for some seriously tasty food. 

We had the pork and pumpkin dumplings, which was an unexpectedly delicious combination. The pork brought the heavier savoury flavors while the pumpkin lent a sweetness, all in a bite sized package. Get an appetiser of lamb skewers (if you like the gamey taste of lamb) and you have the perfect meal for two people.",2017-08-09 01:16:15

The place was pretty empty, so seated quickly with the help of the owner and his cute little son. Ordered two lunch specials (came with an eggroll, rice and a cup of soup) of Orange Chicken (crispy chicken tossed with tangy orange sauce) & House Chicken (lightly breaded chicken with brown sauce), XO tenderloin (cubed beef, onions and paprikas tossed in a mildly spicy house special XO sauce), Crispy Bone Sole Fish (deep fried lightly breaded whole sole fish with celery & mushroom in a white sauce topped with crispy Chinese kale leaves) and Braised Seafood Tofu. The owner was nice enough to give us all soups: egg drop and hot & sour soup. The soups and eggrolls were okay, but the other food was great and tasty. Unfortunately, the food didn't come out all at the same time. The owner gave a complimentary red velvet cupcake for Mother's day.

bJbhoRuGNJWTeKARHAXDMg,EXKDLuYoZUKUNNNYA7TlGQ,Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ,4,11,4,9,"Picazzo's is an Italian kitchen that features an organic and gluten-free menu. To be honest it was kind of a turn off for me as gluten-free and organic usually means it tastes weird. Such is not the case here. We chose this place because one of our party has a gluten allergy. Not everything on the menu is gluten-free, but they do take special care to make sure there is no cross contamination. My wife has a coconut allergy and was concerned about the menu having coconut in the ingredients. Our waiter checked to make sure there was no coconut in what she ordered.

I chose the lunch combo which is your choice of pizza, pasta or a baked dish; and soup or salad. My choice was the slice of the week (pizza) which was Italian sausage and caramelized onion. I also ordered the creamy tomato basil soup. In a short time my lunch was on the table. I could have made a meal of just soup. The tomato soup was smooth and creamy with basil and a hint of cayenne, nothing too intense. The pizza was also very good. Although the crust wasn't gluten-free it was still organic and whole wheat. They do offer a gluten-free crust.There was not a lot of sauce on the slice which opened the door for the other flavors to come through. The pizza was baked perfectly and had a generous amount of toppings. 

Our waiter was attentive through the meal keeping our drinks full and answering any questions we had. I got a complimentary piece of raspberry cheese cake for checking in on Yelp. I was going to split it with my wife, but it contained a small amount of coconut. Our waiter brought her a complimentary scoop of ice cream since she couldn't have the cheese cake.

I am quite impressed with Picazzo's. This place totally exceeded my expectation of what healthy food should taste like. I would recommend Picazzo's to anyone with food a food allergy as they take strive to make a great tasting meal with respect to their dietary restriction.",2017-07-30 22:19:22

To start the slices are bigger than average and $5 and under. They also really hook you up with toppings.

YXEhr6Ucp0LWLfbAZZr9jA,fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,4,2,1,2,"When I lived in the Northeast, I used to travel all the way to Montreal to find hot pot. Now that the weather is getting chilly in Vegas, I find myself in search of hot pot once more. Chubby Cattle is the newest hot pot restaurant in town. It's funny that it advertises itself as ""Chinese fondue"" and the interior decor is a little bit ridiculous, but whatever appeals to the masses. 

For those who have never tried hot pot, Chubby Cattle is a fun and interactive introduction. You start off by choosing a soup base. If you're sitting at one of the individual stoves, you can pick any broth except the Heaven and Hell, which is reserved to be shared between people on one of the larger burners. I stayed clear of the spicy broth and stuck with the House Original. Next, you choose an assortment of meats, vegetables, noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and whatever else you feel like putting in your hot pot. Otherwise, if you're sitting next to the conveyor belt, you pick whatever looks good that passes by.

For ingredients, the meats are high quality. I enjoyed the beef brisket, prime short rib, and lamb. The presentation of the mushrooms, vegetables, and noodles were aesthetically amazing. The mushrooms and vegetable combos look as if they had just been foraged from a farmer's market and come in a wooden basket. The arrangement of the assorted meatballs make it easy to cook by hooking it onto your pot without losing it into the abyss. There's also a sauce bar where you can mix and create your own dipping sauce. My personal preference was the fresh garlic, green onions, and white pepper in the ponzu sauce. 

Overall, dinner was fun and delicious. Everyone got a scoop of complimentary coffee ice cream. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and service was excellent. My one gripe about Chubby Cattle would be the cost for the amount of food we got. Everything was fresh and delicious, but we were pretty hungry even after a couple of rounds of meat and vegetable/mushroom baskets. It came out to be around $30 per person, which is on the expensive side considering it's hot pot (traditionally, a cheap homemade meal). Also Little Sheep (the franchise Mongolian hot pot) is all-you-can-eat for cheaper. If you're hungry and you eat a lot, you might want to look elsewhere.",2016-12-05 07:38:38

We split a dragon roll,  a spicy salmon roll and a crab salad roll.  So sue us, we were hungry.  

The eel on the dragon roll was really good this time-- fresh and moist.  The salmon was fantastic-- really fresh, high quality, vibrant and buttery.  Points for drsssing the salmon so it lacked any of those tough stringy things.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those things completely ruin a bite of sushi for me.  The edamame were slightly overcooked.  Like I said, we were hungry.

Super great beers ( sworn to by my three friends, since I didn't try any) ... and pretty good food.  My friend had the Omega Goodness (Salmon) and said it was the best meal he has had during our entire 2 week stint staying in Pittsburgh.

I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito which was really just okay. My fiancé had a bean and cheese burrito with a chicken taco and again it was just okay. He said that the chicken taco was probably the best thing out of everything. We also ordered chips and salsa which were very disappointing. We ordered the spicy salsa which was not at all spicy and very salty. The chips were not warm and tasted very generic. I could have definitely had better chips and salsa at home any day, would not ever order these here again. The habanero hot sauces were the only thing that saved the salsa in this case. The chorizo in my burrito had an okay flavor but I mostly found myself eating around it and eating the bean and cheese half of the burrito. Apparently America's Taco Shop is known for their carne asada which we were told later but I did not get the memo. I might come back to try the carne asada but I would rather go to Espo's or even Rubio's over ATS.

They had a burger special, too, but instead of the scallops I had planned to order, I went with the prix fixe anniversary menu.

The meal started with an amuse-bouche--a demi tasse size cup of their squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil.  It was very tasty and it's a draw to get me back to try more.

I was brought the standard metal container with two slices of bread and two of lavash and some honey butter.  The breads were good.

The first course was a salad with pork belly.  The pork belly was cooked nicely and the greens had a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  There were red and yellow plum tomatoes in the salad.

The second course was ahi tuna.  It was seared perfect;y with a red interior.  The ahi was served on red and white quinoa and some of their house made salsa.  The seasoning of the quinoa and the ahi were excellent!

For dessert, the only course with a choice, I went with their butterscotch pudding.  It came in a glass jar and on the lid were some Cracker Jacks.  The lid was removed by the server and placed on the plate.  There was a layer of cookie crumb beneath the pudding and then some chocolate pudding below.  Great!

Service was as good as some of the top restaurants on the Strip.  I never had more than a few sips of my iced tea when the beverage person was at the table refilling my tea.

-The broccoli tempura, perfectly crispy yet bright steamed green inside.

After working like crazy to clean and move heavy furniture in my livingroom (on my birthday no less) while my other half worked the Calgary Comic Expo all day, neither of us were interested in cooking that night so when a friend of ours said he loved this place we thought we'd finally give it a try.  It's right down the street so why we didn't go sooner I have no idea....

It's a busy sushi shop that is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  Clean, bright, and they give you menus and a pad so you can write down what you want.  I tried their negitoro roll, a philadelphia roll (cheating for my current diet but it was my birthday so meh), the chicken karaage, a hot california roll, split a shrimp tempura and an onion rings, and split I think the tiger roll, because it had unagi on top and wasn't the golden dragon one (D ate the head on that, it was so cute)!

I wish their salmon was wild, not farmed, but it was fresh and didn't have the usual tasteless-farmed-salmon taste/texture to it so at least it was quality stuff.

We went here to celebrate Cinco de Mayo and it was just a bad experience all around. I wish we would have saved our money and gone elsewhere but in the name of being festive, we went anyways.

We sat out on the patio hoping to enjoy some food and drinks and we did but everything took forever and their prices for what they're serving are completely asinine. I got a chicken burrito that was swimming in different types of salsa, one of which smelled like curry and made me want to throw up. There was no taste whatsoever and I could barely choke down 1/3 of it. The drinks weren't much better either but at least I could taste the hooch in them. If you're going for drinks it's a great place (if you got money to burn) and if you want to do a conga line for free shots poured down your throat, again great. Personally when I go out for food and drinks I want to enjoy the full experience, not worry about my feet sticking to the ground due to liquor, sweat, hoochie and broken dreams.Shaking my head just thinking about this place.",2013-05-09 03:01:58

They are way off. The ads said there were thousands of petroglyphs here, even suggesting to come at 10AM when the sun shines on the glyphs and to bring your own binoculars. On top of that, the website said that there is a butterfly exhibit in Feb. that was part of the ""tour"". Sounds awesome, right? And I'm a pretty good photographer too. 

So I get here. The visitor's center is nice and informative. However, the price is a little steep for what you get. I walk through the back gate and enter the trail. It's a flat, pebbled trail, only a 1/4 mile long. There is no ""tour guide"", nor a ""tour"". There was no butterfly exhibit. I'm there at exactly 10AM and there are not thousands of petroglyphs. Even with the binocs, they are hard to find and faded. For just $6 parking, you can see way more glyphs at South Mountain Park on the Kiwanis Trail.

The most exciting part about this tour was that a large squirrel approached us (see attached photos) and was really, really curious about us. You reach the end of the trail and that's when you figure out that you've been duped. If it wasn't government run, it would have been shut down a long time ago.",2012-03-03 20:18:20

Steakhouses and seafood joints are my favorite to visit, and my favorite out of those, is 35 Steak and Martini.

Let me start by saying that while the pricing is your standard fine dining, the experience and the food is not.  A lot of the time when I go out to fine dining, everything is so fancy and so refined and just seems a little too ""the portions are really small and have ingredients I've never heard of, and it's expensive so it must be good.""  I want to recognize at least one thing in a dish...or at the very least have heard of it before.  Don't get me wrong, I love trying new things, but it was extremely refreshing to familiarize with a lot of the appetizers...and I wanted to try it all!!!  One day I might go in and just eat all of the appetizers and nothing else. 
The steaks are phenomenal. Always tender and juicy and cooked how I order it, and it's usually more than I can finish, even a filet!
I don't know if you saw the photos of the desserts, but OMG. The chocolate peacock cake. No, it's not made out of peacock, but the chocolate/sugar decor slightly resembled a peacock tail to me so I just keep referring to it as such lol.

Visited: Saturday afternoon around 2:30PM for late lunch and sweets. 

First impressions: Entered cafe and was unsure as to if we should take a seat or order at the counter. No signs depicting what to do & only one laminated paper menu available on the counter. Decided to sit down and were greeted with menus ~ 5 minutes later (a couple that came in a few minutes after us were greeted and had their orders taken before us)

Ordered: 1 Mince pork rice, 2 pork belly rices, small thai milk tea w/honey boba, large orange yuzu tea w/honey boba (orange yuzu is only available in the large size), matcha espresso latte, 1 honey toast, and 2 taiyaki.

What we ACTUALLY got: 2 pork belly rices, small thai milk tea WITHOUT BOBA, large orange yuzu tea WITHOUT BOBA, matcha espresso latte, 1 honey toast, and ONLY ONE taiyaki. Entrees arrived before our drinks. Saw other tables that arrived AFTER us, receive their drink orders before we did (they ordered the same drinks!). My sister's  matcha espresso latte was brought to us only after being left on another group's table for a few minutes. (It didn't look like they drank out of it...but at this point, we already were questioning a few things). When I asked the server about the missing boba, he returned with another cup filled 1/4 way with boba and a small spoon. No boba straw was provided...boba through a regular straw is NOT what I had expected. Returned the boba to the front counter and let them know that I couldn't enjoy it as it was intended. Also noticed that I did not receive a small light to go under my orange yuzu (all of the other tables were provided with a light under their yuzu drinks).

Food availability: Cafe opens at noon. Only 2.5 hours later they ran out of Mince Pork Rice. When the server was asked about alternatives, she noted that they also ran out of curry rice & that the skewers ""would take too long"". Server did not offer any suggestions for what to order instead.

Missing order: TAIYAKI :( I had convinced my group to go to Cafe Summer after seeing the amazing pictures on instagram and yelp of their taiyaki. Our table received 1 taiyaki (strawberry ice cream with mochi/pocky sticks, nutella filling) and waited 25 minutes....seeing that we had spent already over 2 hours at a cafe, I asked the server about my taiyaki order & she did not know how much longer it would be. At that point, I asked to cancel the order and pay off my bill--which still had all of our other missing food orders added into it.

Service: Questionable. Servers were not very interactive or personable..when confronted with questions about missing/incorrect orders they would walk away before I could finish asking. Server also pushed us to order all of our food, drinks, and desserts..noting that it would take longer if it was done separately. Honestly, After waiting nearly 30 minutes between each item, I don't know how much slower it could've been.

OVERALL: Highly disappointed by my experience at Cafe Summer. For what food was available, the food flavor was lacking and left a lot to be desired. Service/poor execution of dishes led us to have an unplanned 2+ hour lunch. I regret convincing my group to come here as I was not able to try their signature TAIYAKI (and from what we did receive of the other taiyaki, was underwhelming and not well made). Lesson learned.",2017-01-16 23:45:44

However, today I walked in and found a seat near the coffee bar... I had some work to do and I got some water...
I didn't plan on getting coffee or something to drink for a while, as I had drank so much coffee in the morning...
The workers were nice and asked if I wanted anything, I politely told them that I was going to have water for now but then eventually get something a bit later...

He came over and checked on me to see if I needed anything...
At first, I thought he was being polite and exhibiting exceptional customer service, but really he was trying to make me buy something... a drink or anything...
I get that I am here using the WIFI, but I recently told the workers that I was going to buy something eventually.... and as a regular, I feel a little uneasy about being forced to purchase something just to use the WIFI... I get it, as a small local business, you WIFI is not free and people shouldn't come in to just use it...
So I am not sure if they get a lot of people who just come in for WIFI, but there are also signs that sort of say WIFI is for paying customers...
So I think I got the memo...
After this exchange I just feel a little weird and now I feel really pressured into buying something... As a small business owner, I think you live and die off of customer service and although I may be only one person, it just sort of rubbed me in the wrong way...

I will continue coming to Black Cat and hoping that I don't get pressured into buying something as soon as I walk through the doors... I do have the memo that WIFI is not free, so maybe next time I will just buy something and throw it away... just to make it clear that I am making a purchase...

The only blip was the service. I'm used to friendly, knowledgeable servers. Last night my server was, at best, awkward.  I had to ask him to tell me about specials and take my order, as he lingered around sheepishly until I addressed him.  
I asked him about the ceviches and he recommended the wahu ceviche without even a mention to how spicy it is. My friend and I like spicy, but I think this is something that should be noted either on the menu or by the server. Anyway, the dish was good. Very strong cilantro flavour and spicy. 

He did warn us not to order the side ribs each, which I appreciated.  He was right, they were very rich -- and INCREDIBLE! One order was more than enough for the two of us. 

We also had:
The char ceviche -- this was our favourite dish.  A stunning combination of delicate sweet  flavours and crisp apple. If you go to Foxely get this dish!

The kale salad - OMG I never knew kale could taste so good!

The mango and seaweed salad - this could be skipped. but still it was pretty good, 

The salmon tataki- another winner, though paled in comparison to the char ceviche.

-  Signage is a bit tough as it blends in with Doc Hollidays signage
-  Seat yourself and server only service model not effective
-  Windows need to be cleaned 
-  Ceiling fan on high and can't be shut off upon request
-  Tables leave and sit full of dirty dishes for long period of time
-  Out of brisket on a Saturday night
-  The meat platter and sides were good albeit all food served lukewarm 
-  It is odd that Texas toast was only toasted on one side
-  I found the decor kind of odd and inexpensive
-  Upon going to the counter to pay check server asked if I had info for my coupon . I never had a coupon?  Then I found out about some great deal I couldn't take advantage of.
-  Lastly, asked for toothpicks and server said they were out of toothpicks...I said really how do you run out of toothpicks..  She then went over to Docs and came back with a few.  

So, we either came on the worst Saturday night they have had since they opened or they have alot of work to do...me thinks it is the latter.

Both of us shared the lobster mac & cheese starter, Balsamic Grilled Chicken salad and LaDou's Barbecue Chicken pizza - total bill ~$35, decent priced dinner for 2 in my opinion.

- mac & cheese came in an oval dish the size of my hand (see pic) and was bomb-dig as mac & cheese should be. 
- salad was plentiful - pretty sure I'd be full if that was my meal. There was adequate chicken to salad ratio and the gorgonzola cheese provided to right kick.

Really, you can park at either the theatre in Stonecrest or in front of Firebirds and everything is walkable. Really dig that about this location. 

The interior: Awesome. It's like walking into a swanky lumberjack's den. There's exposed wood, firewood, more wood....and wooden things. Dimly lit, high ceilings, lanterns....or ""man""terns, for that matter. Just a really cool feel. I really like the split level, too. 

Our service was VERY attentive. I really can't stress how much this guy wanted to serve us. His name was Brett and he was thorough, nice, educated, and well-placed throughout the meal. 

We started with their signature cocktail -- Black Diamond Martini. I have to say it was a total letdown. Their infused citron vodka was like dull pineapple juice. It housed no kick and was just....meh. I mean, I really dig pineapple juice, but $10 pineapple juice? Think I'll pass.

I have to comment on the bread they serve pre-meal. What IS that loaf? I've never seen that shape, structure, or texture in bread before! Coated in semolina...which gets all over you and the table, by the way, and is almost cracker-like on the exterior with a slight chew in the middle. It tastes just fine, but man....what a strange recipe/method. 

I ordered the coconut shrimp for an entree. I've been on a kick of ordering things I normally wouldn't on a given night. Sigh....it was just boring. 10 semi-large shrimp, a cabbage slaw with tortilla chips, large steak fries, and an awful mango-habanero dipping sauce. The shrimp were fine au naturale, but that dipping sauce totally ruins everything. I'd rather have ketchup and that's really bad. 

I love the decor and the service. The food and sig cocktail....not so much. I'd love to come back and just sit at the bar with a beer before a movie, though! I'ma get my plaid on, kick back and enjoy that wood-laden ambiance! Cheers.",2012-12-12 14:28:46

Originally from Atlanta, where Asian foods, (and Thai) are readily available, I found this place to my preference when it came to Asian foods in Charlotte.  I almost always got the (sometimes extra spicy) spicy basil beef, and it was just the right amount of spicy that kind of burns your tongue a little but doesn't cause you to run in search of milk.  Not sure what the dinner menu is like, but I assume it's more expensive.  I wouldn't pay more than the lunch price for a meal here.",2011-08-30 23:58:16

The staff was very courteous, and I believe it was the manager or franchise owner that greeted us.  He described the menu for us, and welcomed us to the restaurant,was clean and bright.

That said, I had one of the Carne Asada tacos, and one of the Al Pastor tacos.  Both were kind of average and uninspiring.  Here is the quick list of likes and dislikes about the food.

1. The guacamole was the processed kind, not the handmade kind, this caused it to have a processed flavor which was kind of flat and off.

2. The tortillas were kind of weak, and partially fell apart during the meal.

3. The Carne Asada was overcooked.

4. The Al Pastor was pretty good.

Being a franchise, I don't know if they can change things like which tortillas or guacamole they use, but it would definitely make things better.

a happy ending indeed
pleasure of the mouth

I'll be damned if this joint can't hang with any real Chinese places anywhere.  In our fair city there are loads of American Chinese craptastic places, buffets, which range from gross to wretched, but this place is the real deal. No General Tso's chicken scraps, no sweet and sour dog food, but a myriad of authentic and flavorful dishes. 

The cumin lamb was a hot and spicy treat that packed a wallop, but was not some test of manhood to eat. You could taste a lot more than the peppers. The chive dumplings were homemade and the filling was very flavorful.  Szechwan beef was wonderfully nuanced. Sesame chicken -best I ever tasted.

The ubiquitous flat screen showed a Chinese flick. Interestingly, the sound was on and the movie was not dubbed, but it had Chinese subtitles as well.

Amuse - I couldn't tell you what this was, but it was tasty. It had a piece of asparagus with nuts.
Mesquite Ha:l Soup - The presentation is beautiful. The cotton candy gets melted right in front of you with the soup.
Three Sisters - The scallop was cooked perfectly.
Intermezzo - The sorbet was refreshing.
Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo - The tenderloin was fork tender. The smoked corn puree was delicious and the chorizo was on another level.   
Global Artisan Cheese - I had two cheeses. One was mild, can't remember the name and the other was a type of blue cheese. I enjoyed them with some honey and crackers.
Dessert - The dessert was sorbet and too pretty to eat. Of course, I ate it all.

This was the best culinary experience of my life. Everything was perfect! I felt like I was a judge on Iron Chef America. The presentation was beautiful. Yes, the food is different, because it's not a steakhouse. So, you have to be open to eating locally farmed ingredients and Native American inspired dishes. The menu is showcased on a piece of Mesquite with a watercolor painting from a local Native American artist. The view of the sunset was breathtaking.     

The service was excellent. They push in your chair and place the napkin on your lap. We never had to wait for a refill. The service explains every course to you.

We washed it all down with a bottle of cab-franc ($33).  The total bill for dinner with tip came to over $135!, and I still had to hit McDonalds on the way home because I was starving after we left.  When I complained that the dessert appeared to be simply a chocolate muffin top drowned in pomegranate sauce and inedible seeds, the manager's solution was to demand that we wait at the table while she fried a donut, which was served under a virtual snowbank of powder sugar. Everything, even the supplemental donut, tasted decidedly mediocre for the price, and the portions were so small that there was barely enough food one person served between the two of us.

It's sparsely decorated, mostly just some paintings for sale, and mason jar lights overhead. The bar is open so you can see the bartenders making your drinks with fresh ingredients and can see the copper stills and some barrels in the background.

The Painkiller was made with a coconut cream and it was creamy and delicious. The Zombie was citrusy and for having three kinds of rum, was strong but still tasted really good. They limit you to 2!

Unlike some reviewers, I thought the bartenders were friendly and the one talked to me about the different kind of rum and gave me some samples. I thought their spiced rum was really smooth and the best spiced rum I've had. We loved the Queen's share label, which the bartender explained is made by redistilling the tails from the first batch.

#2 Customer Service: the greeters, the personal care person, and the mechanics all made me feel extremely valued.  Kinda like what I would expect at a BMW dealer (except I have been to BMW dealers and they have only made their customers feel like a$$).

#3 Amenities: I love the business center nook.  I am able to go there and get work done while I wait.  Yeah, and I drink their coffee and eat cookies.

#4 Scheduling and Timing: easy to make appointments online.  And they do the work quickly.  In my instances, quicker than estimated.

#5 Honesty: I thought I needed a part replaced, and scheduled for it. But they assured me I didn't and that their regular maintence would fix it.  They could have made an additional $100, but chose to be honest with me.

BOAy4ZsCWdXLbYGy0-_KXg,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,sB1lPLICz4nrOuuqgLv50A,3,6,2,3,"Probably the most underwhelming of the private group steakhouse dinners that I've been to.

I was invited to attend a dinner at Morton's The Steakhouse with a modified version of the Silver Menu, the lowest cost tier of their private dinner menu (as published on their web site: http://www.mortons.com/private_dining/menus/PDR_for_Web_12_16.pdf). The differences included lack of hors d'oeuvres and only one dessert selection. As with my other recent experiences, I did not have any personal expenses for this occasion.

Service was good, as I've come to expect. Plates and utensils were delivered and removed efficiently and unobtrusively. I would've been glad to be informed that only one drink portion would be available, but at least I was able to get out quickly and safely after consuming my delicious Cabernet early on. Pleasant, non-Stumptown-y coffee (their beans are always too acrid for me) at the end also helped, and the server obliged when I changed my mind after they made their rounds.

Atmosphere was better. Music was low. More importantly, the private room was rather well-lit and, for whatever reason, remained that way. That's always a plus whether you're taking photos for Yelp or just trying to see the color of the interior of your steak. Oh, and the restroom was clean and also quiet.

The complimentary bread and butter was actually really nice. The bread was crunchy and fluffy, with onion bits on top, and the butter was light and tastier than usual.

First dish to arrive was the Caesar Salad. It was very simple, with one medium-sized crunchy slice of bread as a crouton and no meat or anything. All the lettuce was fresh and crispy, and the dressing was even and not too heavy, but it was ordinary compared to what I've had at other chain steakhouses.

The main course came next. Of course I ignored the salmon and chicken dishes, choosing the 8 oz. Filet Mignon as any reasonable person (sans dietary concerns) would do in a steakhouse. I had mine cooked medium-rare and decided to say yes when the server asked if I wanted it red in the middle, and the steak came out cooked exactly that way, to my surprise. Unfortunately, the flavor was a little lacking as I've come to expect from most filets, and the beef wasn't even that tender. Definitely the least impressive of my recent steakhouse entrees.

We had two sides. Sauteed Garlic Green Beans, presented on the same plate as the entree, were crunchy but bland. ""Twice Baked"" Au Gratin Potatoes were served family-style and were delicious as cheesy potatoes usually are. I would've definitely cleaned the plate if there weren't so many people at the table.

Dessert was Cheesecake. It was really delicious, and it almost convinced me to up my rating. The cake was sweet but not overly so, and the crust had a surprising crispiness at the bottom. The half-strawberry garnish was a little pale, but made up for lack of redness with ideal sweetness and bursting-ness.

Dinner at Morton's in a private dining format was not bad overall, but I can't be a fan when the steak is mildly disappointing, the star is a sometimes-skippable course, and the other standouts are just supporting cast.

That being said, all of the food was tasty.  I had the veggie burger which was made in house.  Very tasty, but very messy.  If I were to order it again, I would get it without the bun and eat it with a fork and knife.  It came with fresh cut fries that were crisp and tasty.

Let me tell you... not a good idea. We were both tired and just wanted it all to be over with. So, we registered for the easy stuff, and I decided to make an appointment with one of their registry specialists for another day. This preggo needed her beauty rest. 

So I came back, well rested and open minded, to meet with Chris. I told him that I was lost in a sea of baby bottles and breast pumps. He laughed and led the way through the store, scanner in hand. By the time we finished, I felt educated and comfortable with my decisions (even if it meant that we took about an hour and a half to make the full round of the store). Chris is awesome!

We went in this past Friday, they were busy but not jam packed, there were plenty of open tables. 

There were 6 in our party. We ordered 5 pizzas and 2 salads. 

4 pizza come out pretty quickly. As the waiter (Who looked like he might be the manager, as he had on a different shirt then the rest of the staff) went to give my little 13 year old cousin her pizza he full on hits her in the head with the pizza plate. She sits there stunned, says ouch, and is holding her head where he hit her. He doesn't even say sorry, instead he says ""Ive never seen that happen"" and WALKS AWAY. We were all kind of shocked, no sorry??? 

So 4 pizza are on the table. My mother in law had ordered her own pizza. It become obvious they forgot. We question them on it, the server mumbles something and then another 10-15 minutes go by and out comes her pizza, again no apology.

Noticing there's a bar on the patio, I wondered if I had to go up there, but nope, I see a single waitress scurrying around, while a little busy, didn't even acknowledge me. 

Minutes later, a couple of us and I went inside, hoping for better service at the bar. Nope. After a few minutes and barbacks and bartenders passing us without acknowledgement, one of them noticed our presence and happily asked to wait a minute.  The bar wasn't crowded, only 2 others at the 15 seat bartop.. Knowing better, we ordered 2 rounds for 16oz $2 summer shandy's (it was the monthly special, yes please!) and went our way back outside. 

Almost through the 2nd round, the waitress on the patio approaches us for the first time, we order another round. 

Minutes later, she unexpectedly brings out summer shandy cans, says the cans are 16oz, better value than the 12oz glasses. Standard pint glass are 16oz, you know right ?! Well, at we know she can read the can and can bring a combination of plastic cups and glasses which can we use to pour our beers....

We had a cat (RIP Gus) who toward the end of his 20yr life was confused & often incontinent. We have 3.5 cats & 3.5 dogs, I say this because one of our cats thinks that she's a dog (If Bruce can think he's a woman then my cat can think she's a dog!)
 It's a catch 22, we need the home equity loan to tear up the carpet & put in hard flooring, amongst other upgrades but we have to have the carpet cleaned to get the loan to tear it up. Austin said that J2 had the best reviews & I can see why! They did an awesome job! We will tear up our carpet but would feel comfortable putting it off for a few months because it actually looks pretty good for now. They provided us with booties while our carpet dries.
 One of the gentlemen has 3 cats & 2 dogs himself (one of his cats has an identity issue as well) I know one cleaner was Marvin, I think the other was Paco. Our dog Lola is small but fearless, she hates all men at first, they have to prove themselves to her. She is extremely territorial & protective. She got past me & ran to where they were working & nothing, she didn't bark at them, snap at them, growl at them... nada. This alone meant a lot to me that our dogs were comfortable with these men in our house. 
 I highly recommend J2 & even after our carpet is gone I will call them for furniture cleaning, they did a beautiful job on our lazy boy (my husband really stained it up!) It's a nice electric recliner, it's too good to have looked so bad. Now it looks & smells incredible!

The place was only half seated for a friday night. 80% of the people where indian so i figured this would be an authentic indian place. The seating and decorations were very old fashioned and I didn't much enjoy sitting with the cleaning equipment and used trays behind me. 

We ordered the appetizer platter to start which was  a very large portion for only two people to share. I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I didn't much like that everything was breaded and not like the thin crispy coating but it was very thick. All the batter was so thick that i could barely taste the vegetables underneath all the breading. One item was nothing but bread or maybe a potato of sorts. It tasted ok but it was just too thick.

For our entrees i ordered the dosa stuffed with potato and onions, my hubby ordered the masala made of cheese and a red sauce. I didn't like the masala because it tasted like foreign spaghetti sauce. The cheese flavor was a little too strong for me. I did however love the dosa. The bread was thin and soft like a crepe and very very large, Larger than the entire plate. I found that interesting that they made them so big. I wasn't sure how to eat it so i just tore off pieces of dosa and made small burrito like pieces with the potato and onions. They cam with alot of different sauces but they were very watered down. I had a white curry sauce, a green one and something that tasted like spicy tomato and vegetable soup. The soup mixture was probably my favorite. I ate it directly from the tin dish as if it were soup. They also had my favorite Tamarind sauce which was very yummy but a bit too thick. 

My only suggestion would be to update the decorations and dinnerware. I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of eating in a place that serves there food on cafeteria dishes. Other than that this place was not too bad. I will probably return to try a different dish and hopefully have a better result with my appetizer selection. Also, i didn't realize that this is a vegetarian spot so no lamb or chicken vindaloo :(",2013-09-11 22:49:32

Relative to beer, Church took a major hit when its head brewery ran down the street to open his own gig (on my list of beers to try!).  Thus far, it seems like the quality of their brews hasn't been majorly affected, but CBW is one of those places that I either absolutely love or absolutely hate their beer.  A monthly rotating ""blast furnace stout"" (different flavors/methods of brewing) always presents an interesting drink, and their Cherry Quadzilla is good if you like fruity interpretations of Belgians.  Thunderhop IPA is that staple of the bunch, and a good representation of the type at that.

Relative to food, Church is generally also hit or miss here too.  Most of their food is average, however their pizza (particularly the wild boar) is extremely good (just be prepared to wait an hour plus if the oven gets backed up).

Overall, I'll give Church the nod as it truly is a unique gem to the city (one that's gotten a lot of national attention, including Brewpub of the Year), but it falls short of a five considering its roughness around the edges and a lack of consistency.",2013-08-06 17:38:42

I feel that I have to start with the service as it was extremely attentive and professional, just perfect. We were a group of nine, big crowd to take care of, but my wine glass was never empty, always filled on time. Besides perfect knowledge of the menu our hostess demonstrated amazing skills in replacing quickly a table cloth soaking in wine. 

The food was great! We started the night with dozen of oysters from the Maritimes, which were delicious. Although this was enough for appetizer the menu temptation was so strong that we ended up sharing the fried quail that I would eat right now if somebody brings me a piece as it was yummy. 

My main was the arctic char, served with white beans and almonds, and other good ingredients that will make it a perfect meal. It doesn't look like a huge piece of fish, but it is really filling. The other dish I tried and seriously loved was the home made lamb cavatelli, very good choice for pasta lovers. The chef will prepare for you a vegetarian version of the cavatelli if needed. I'm truly impressed with how good the faux fillet from Colorado looks and so was one of our friends who ordered it with its taste, and quality. 

The dessert choice was strongly influenced by the multiple reviews we read, we had to have the pancakes, and yes, it was worthy. The grand finale was a piece of chocolate sweet, which was perfect and went so well with the digestif, Amaro recommended by our hostess. 

Talking about drinks, the wine list is solid and cocktails are original. My martini was a little bit disappointing as it came in a regular whiskey glass and initially tasted distilled water. As a compensation the bar tender fixed a delicious Manhattan for my sweet heart.

S8kdJIARXDzwUU8W-hmojQ,LTnCcTKbS-SBQlFGJ5Jm7g,tCjlXROlbcaGiBRfU2jaiw,3,3,0,0,"Background: I had a great first experience here in a small group of 4 on a weekday, so I decided that I wanted to celebrate my birthday at the Mansion. So I emailed ahead to ask for reservations for a group of 15 on a Saturday evening. I was informed that they would not take any reservations and was advised to arrive an hour early for seating. 

Facility: Located on the northeast corner of Jarvis and Wellesley, there is free parking after 5:30pm for guests of The Keg. Otherwise, it's pay enforced (this is a new thing they just added in recent months). Parking IS cramped though, so larger vehicles beware. Washrooms are okay, the decor is romantic, although the upstairs by the bar is quite loud. 

Food Quality & Price: Food is a little more pricey than other Keg locations (either that, or there was a recent price increase). My usually favourite the Blue Cheese Fillet has gone up again, now at $37 for 7oz (no other options). I asked for medium rare, and got medium well. I didn't ask for them to remake it because there was absolutely no time and we needed it on the fly. The first time I came (weekday) it was perfection, this time around, was just sloppy. I was overall, slightly disappointed by our experience. 

Service: Leading up to the day of, email exchanges were curt and to the point. We arrived at 6:30 and was told that the wait would be around a hour, we were not seated until 8:30 (2 hours) and had to leave by 9:30!! So it was really pushing it. As we waited upstairs by the bar, waitresses were visibly frazzled. When they asked some members of our group what they wanted to drink, if you have them more than a 5 second hesitation, they would just walk away! This happened on more than one occasion. The location was busy and packed, no one wanted to give us the time of day. We made the most of it anyway. 

When we were finally seated, we ordered on the fly. Everyone was starving. Service during the sit-down meal was superb. We ate and were out the door by quarter to 10 (although my steak left much to be desired).

Overall: AVOID WEEKENDS!! It's an absolute mess here on the weekend, service slacks, no reservations, wait times are horrid, staff is frazzled/frustrated and it shows. My experience at the Keg Mansion during weekday evenings was so much more relaxing and pleasant. I would certainly recommend that The Keg Mansion reviews their no reservation policy for weekends and allot a certain number for special occasion/events or large groups. It was just absolute chaos and that pressure was reflected on the faces of their staff and the quality of the food.

started with duck confit (excellent!), bone marrow (can't really mess up, love the oxtail jam), and the foie gras which was a bit disappointing considering the good things I've heard about it here

main course, we had the scallops, which were good, and the flat iron steak, which was better than expected! (only issue was waiter did forget to bring our order of brussel sprouts)

Rather than leave the meal he took the entire plate back to get the potato & it took him about 10 minutes to come back. Sending food back makes me very nervous so I didn't eat much. Honey enjoyed the steak and potatoes. Green beans were cooked with red bell peppers so they had that flavoring. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best service.",2016-10-02 03:57:04

Dulce de Leche
Chocolate
Strawberry
Assorted Flavours (i.e. Nutella)

I decided to go with dulce de leche. The churro was good, but not hot. I am not sure why they have so many churros pre-made, and sitting there losing their freshness. I think it would make more sense to make them to-order rather than have them sitting there getting stale-the batter is already made, so what would be the big deal? The dulce de leche filling was nice and thick, though the chocolate we found was not thick enough, and thus was harder to contain in the churro.

SERVICE:We were seated right away but waited awhile before we go any service. The hostess came back and took our drink order. Eventually the server came out, had no idea about our drinks and we ended up waiting awhile for them. We were still waiting for one more person so I guess the server figured she wouldn't check back until the last person was there. So finally our drinks come out and we rush to tell her about our appetizer. But even when the last person joined us, the service still moved slowly. 
FOOD AND DRINKS- we had margaritas. The white peach and guava margaritas were awesome! We also had the blood orange which I found to be a little too bitter for me. We started with the buffalo nachos which were good. I really liked the queso sauce they used. I had the fajita salad: the meat was well seasoned but there was too much dressing which made everything soggy :(

Guessing that was only because the guy who cooks (the owner?) helped us instead of the awful Japanese waitresses. They probably just hired them because they speak Japanese regardless of experience but I've seen the same ones working for over 2 years. They've never gotten any better. 
Shuseki's food is great, its my fav place for ramen because of their variety. Love tan tan and the karubi ramen. Lol had to say karubi out loud to realize they were phonetically spelling kalbi spoken w a Japanese accent. 
I continue to go back despite the bad service but here was the worst experience I've had with them. My friend and I both ordered ramen, he got his within 10 min and I sat and waited for mine. Waited 15 additional minutes till I flagged her over and asked about my food. She gave me a blank look said she'll check on it. My friend shared some of his while we waited for another 10-15 min and I just gave up and told her cancel it and bring us the check. Mind you there were only 3 other tables of people, so the kitchen and waitress werent at all busy. When she brought the check, she apologized and said - don't leave tip. No worries honey, you weren't getting one anyway.

I'm sure it's a frustration for them, but their delivery guys always seem friendly. They also deliver by appointment. On this day they were ten minutes early.

Decent pizza, but far from great. Price (and perhaps flavored crust) has always been their selling point. I ""liked"" their pizza a lot better when they were selling one topping pizzas for five bucks, but they've done away with that promotion. $6.50 is now the going price, a 30% increase. Still cheap, but I opt for Hungry Howie's when I'm ordering eight or ten pizzas or more, so it definitely adds up for me. They also charge $3.50 for delivery. And a tip for the driver of course.

I like their delivery service and tolerate their pizza. They've always been my go-to source when a timely delivery and mass quantities were needed. I have had some minor confusion with orders in the past, a complaint shared by some other reviewers, so I've taken to physically walking into the store to preorder when I'm having a large quantity of pizza delivered.

My husband and I met up with them Downtown to enjoy Fremont Street and to get some quick, cheap ""old Vegas style"" dinner. We meandered around trying to find a steak and lobster special, but we realized that deal didn't happen until 9 PM and we were hungry. 

We noticed the ""9.95"" prime rib special at Magnolia's, which is located in the Four Queens so we decided, hey why not. The place is definitely old school. But it's also a casino cafe trying desperately to be kind of like a diner. It's odd. Either be a cafe or a diner. There is a subtle difference and Magnolia's does not blend it well. Also, Magnolia's offers Hawaiian food, which I was surprised by - a Hawaiian skirt steak special and a Loco Moco. Interesting.

Also of note is the fact that we were definitely the youngest people there by far. I had to navigate around walkers to get through the entrance. No, I am not joking or being funny. Seriously. I had to walk around walkers to get to my table.

Onward - the food.

All of us ordered the same thing - Prime Rib Special, which comes with a potato side and a serving vegetables. It was green beans when we were there. I ordered mine medium and it came out decent. There was quite a bit of fat, but overall the meat was not bad. It is certainly a lot food. I did not finish my plate. In fact, none of us did. So, for the price, I guess it is worth it if you are looking for that Vegas-y cheap protein meal type thing. 

BEWARE - you only get the special pricing if you have a player's club card, which none of us had until we specifically asked if we were getting the right price. Had we not asked, we would have never known and would have been charged $11.95. Lame. Why not just come out and say it? You have to have a player's club card prime rib. There. 

Service - Pretty dang bad. Hence my super low rating. Paired with the ambiance and the oldness of the place and the ""eh, okay food"". But man, service was weird. Our server was nice, but we could barely understand him. Our drinks weren't refilled and we were brought our lemons instead of limes on two occasions. Lastly, the cashier was horribly rude when we went up and asked to split the check. She kept saying, ""You want to split down the middle?"" And we were like, no. We want it completely split. Look, it was only five people not 15. Split the freaking check! She also snatched the receipt out of my hand twice during the process.

I could forgive Magnolia's for being old and just take it as what it is - an old Vegas restaurant, it's an experience! But the service and haughty attitude of the cashier and the hostess was really off-putting. If you're going to run this kind of establishment where your food is mediocre, your service could at least be nicer. Just my two cents.",2013-05-09 16:54:09

The bison steak with chanterelles was delicious in every way. I loved it.

For dessert I had crème brûlée and it was amazing. Perfect in every way as well. They use real vanilla and you can see the specs in the crème. A nice shallow crème brûlée, not too deep like some places. Perfectly crispy and caramelized on top. The shortbread that came with it was equally good.

I love getting the Philly steak sandwich w/cheese, onions and I add mushrooms.  It has always been delicious, so I don't order anything new. Like always, I ordered it.  I took a picture and was excited to tasty it. Here's where things turned.  

I took my first bite and was chewing.  I then realized that there was a long hair in my mouth, twisted around the meat.  I started to pull it out.  It seemed like forever, as I was holding back my gag reflex.   Soooo disgusting.  I immediately called over the waitress.   

The waitress (Jerrilynn, which was awesome), apologized over and over.  She took it to the Manager, Don.   He came over to apologize.  He said, there's not much I can say'. WTF.  He ask what else he could have made for me.  I wasn't even sure I could eat, being so grossed out, I needed a few minutes to see if I could get over it.  He kept making suggestions, like the Prime Rib (most expensive item on the menu - I'll get to that comment later).  He kept standing there for an awkward amount of time, until the waitress saved me by saying, let's give her a few minutes.  

The waitress came back a couple of times to see if I was ready, but no pressure.  After about 15 minutes, and my BF was done with his food, the waitress came back and I told her I would try something completely different.  I ordered the Bread Pudding French Toast.  

The French toast was absolutely delicious.  I took half home, since my regular appetite hasn't returned and my BF had finished along time ago and we didn't want to be late for our movie.  Again the waitress was so apologetic and gave us our bill.   

We finished and headed to the cashier.  I noticed that my Philly was removed from the bill, but the French toast remained.  I thought it would have been a nice gesture by the new Manager to take off that item, since my dining experience was ruined by their employee's hair that was half way down my throat, on my first bite!  I asked the cashiers to call for him.    Side note:   Every time I go there, seems like the same cashiers (Hispanic girls), are never friendly!!!    A lot of people need jobs, and they should be thankful to be working for an awesome hotel, therefore, being happy while they are working.    

The manager arrived, I told him that it would have been nice for him to check out our bill 'before' we received it and was surprised to see the French Toast on there. So....  my thoughts on how he handled this.  Once he figured that he lost the revenue on the Philly, he wanted to still profit by getting me to pay for some other food,  don't forget about the most expensive item on the menu that he wanted me to get, the Prime Rib.  After I asked him, he didn't reply, but took the receipt from my hand and headed to a register.  He came back with not much to say.  I think he said 'I've taken care of it'. I wanted to say, Yeah, only after I had to bring it up to you (which was awkward and embarrassing for me).  

Well, I love the Red Rock Hotel and Casino, and all they have to offer, but I can't say if I'll be back to the Grand Cafe.  If I do, it will be because of the waitress.",2018-02-03 19:48:00

Firstly, $8 after tax for a bubble tea? That's just ridiculous. FYI, Ten Ren's and Presotea at Markville Mall are both running promotions right now for 2 bubble teas for $8.

I came here recently and ordered the Taiwanese sticky rice which was quite disappointing. The sticky rice lacked flavour and the only thing I could taste was the pork floss sprinkled in top. That's the other thing. They charge about $8 after tax for the tiniest portion and can't even make it with real pork? Cheap...

Their popcorn chicken is tasty, I'll give them that. I also enjoy their egg wrap but I've seen this dish fluctuate in size over the years. It's still not worth $6-7 though.

If you're looking for Taiwanese snacks, check out Mama Bear nearby or Papa Chang's over at Markham Rd. They're both much cheaper and better quality.

I had never been but it was definitely smaller than I imagined. My biggest gripe is that there isn't a larger pool to swim in so the tiny wave pool is packed with people on inner tubes.

We came a little after 5 pm and stayed until closing at 10. Lines for tubes and rides wasn't bad at all, especially after 9. 

We went on every ride but the bumpy slide that you go down face first on a mat and the double slide that is steep, and yellow & pink. The rest of the rides were super fun, and I say this as an adult. 

Although the $40/pp general admission price seems steep, the clientele seems a bit... sketchy. If you want to see the best of the best horrible prison tattoos, you best believe you won't be disappointed. It was shocking to see just how many facial tats, obscene tats and absolutely horrific quality tats people have... But I digress. 

We only brought our towels and water. We didn't want to rent a locker and we didn't want to leave our wallets and phones out on a beach chair so leave that stuff at home or locked in your trunk. So many people could take off with your stuff. 

With Brian's season pass, he got a slight discount on food. Chicken fingers were a decent enough snack to split between the two of us.

First off, the proprietor (DaddyO himself?) was super-friendly and nice. He was great about answering the myriad questions about the menu that I and my dining companions had. I also love that they offer half-portions, which is just the right amount of food to fill me up but not so bloated that I would have needed to request a ride back to school in a wheelbarrow.

Best yet, the food came out fast, and my dining companions and I were in and out of there in less than an hour. My half portion of pasta, can of soda, and side order of bread with ""magic oil"" (olive oil with herbs and whatnot) came out to about $10.

One example that always brings a smile to my face is seeing a big crowd of surly punks lined up to get tickets to the Patti Smith documentary they showed last year, talking animatedly about it even though they were just picking up tickets (showtime was like three hours away).  

The only thing I don't like the Royal for is their seats, which I find ungodly uncomfortable.  Part of this might be the fact that I spent the entirety of David Lynch's very long, emotionally uncomfortable Inland Empire sitting with my ass wedged in a seat that felt like plywood.  I understand that space/money factors means they can't have La-z-boy chairs like your monster corporate cinemas but seriously, invest in a cushion you can bring with you!",2008-12-16 01:32:27

I'm not too too far from this restaurant, but man what a gem in Roncevalles neighborhood. I came for a lunch yesterday with a friend and when I stepped foot in the restaurant, it really reminded of the Senator near Yonge Dundas square. It has a antique, vintage, old school style feel, really quite something. Very narrow place too you'll know what I mean once you guys eat there. 

I ordered the carne asada tacos (comes in 3), and the veggie (portobello) burger with a side of fries. My friend and I split everything so I got to try both dishes. You know what happened? I kept saying ""mmm"" every time I bit into the burger, the fries and--you know what everything on the table! The food was so godlike I kept muttering ""mmm"" probably 20x if I can estimate.

The burger's sauce.... I think it's blue cheese paste? It was so strong but it worked so well in the combination. Now the fries. WOW. Texture-wise, it was perfect. I mean...the perfect fries. Perfect amount of salt, crispy-ness/crunch. I loved them. Now the tacos were pretty awesome too. It was a flavor party in my mouth, with guac, perfectly cooked beef...etc etc. Just fantastic.

They'll watch you walk in confused and stumble through the menu before they take the time to do that. Also, the salad isn't worth it.

The Rogue Tomato (at the time of the review) just opened in the shuttered Shangrei-la Chinese Restaurant Spot in Glendale. The restaurant is dark, but modern and woody with a bricked wall and very large black boards decorated with interesting quotes. They have many comfortable booths, tables, a big bar and outdoor seating. The menu is Interesting American, Southwestern, Gastro-Pub, burgers, pizza and more. It goes from very casual up to Ribeye Steak.

We came for dinner and I liked that they offered embellishments of lemon, jalapeño and cucumber for the water. They also started us off with piping hot rosemary dinner rolls with oil and vinegar.

My husband had some questions about the meatloaf and our waitress wasn't trained on the menu and accidentally thought the meatloaf was vegetarian so he ordered something else but I do note that she did find out what was in the meatloaf and let my husband change his order back to the meatloaf.

We started with cups of soup. I had the Roasted Red Pepper Bisque. It was rich and laced with Boursin Cheese. I thought it was good.

My husband had the White Bean and Kale with Andouille. Not sure if they forgot the beans or if whoever scooped out the soup didn't know to stir it because the soup was bean free. That was a slight miss but no big deal. Opening hiccup...to be expected.

For dinner I had the Feta Crusted Halibut. It came with a white bean ragout with wilted arugula.   The fish was a little dry and my waitress was very sweet and offered to get me something else on t the center of the fish was much better so I wanted to keep it. The feta tasted good with the vegetables. 

At this time I don't think the halibut is the sweet spot here but I did notice the burger that walked by looked fabulous.

The menu is so interesting and different. There is nothing like this place in this part of town.

The official Grand Opening is later this month.

 By then they could be ""Rocking.""

Due to the fact that one member of our party has a severe shellfish allergy and another member is on a very restrictive diet, we were unable to try any appetizers so we went straight to the entrees. Everyone except for myself ordered the bone-In Kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter. Only one person who ordered it is a coffee fan but it was enjoyed by everyone. I think it was priced around $50 and it was a truly massive piece of meat! Every single person who ordered this finished it and raved about how juicy and flavorful the cut of meat was that night. I ordered the sliced filet mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms. My steak was prepared perfectly to a medium temp. I thought the steak and sauce however was greatly lacking flavor. I have honestly had more flavorful steaks cooked at home. So for $50, I don't believe this was worth the cost at all. For sides we were rather limited by the diners with restrictions but we ordered the mashed potatoes which were absolutely delicious (we should have ordered 2 sides for the 5 of us) and the asparagus which only 3 out of the 5 diners were able to eat. A nice Zin accompanied our steaks. We had a cake at home so again did not eat dessert. As far as special occasion meals go, If it were for me I'd have much rather dined at meat&Potatoes or Sienna Sulla Piazza or Restaurant Echo-something more adventurous and complex than a simple steakhouse, however our service was excellent and the conversation at the table was enjoyable so pair that with mediocre food, it was a decent evening.",2014-07-29 19:54:10

Aria is not only visually stunning, but equally if not more welcoming.  We came for our wedding anniversary and splurged and reserved a suite in the Sky Suites.  The level of service starts with the well dressed chauffeur who picks you up at the airport, drives you the hotel in a limo through a PRIVATE entrance.  No dealing with the crazy front of the hotel, no crowds, just quiet and a private registration desk.  The check in was flawless and the smiles were genuine.   The registration clerk even asked if we would like to be escorted to our room.  She took our baggage claim check and seamlessly made everything happen. 

When we initially opened the door to our suite, it had been set up for the curtains to simultaneously open, revealing our magnificent view of the Las Vegas Strip.  It was sheer magic.  The kind of magic that gives you an automatic smile and expectations of wonderful things to come.  Our suite was massive and absolutely gorgeous.  The modern decor is impeccable and yet very warm and inviting.  Hubby and I realized quickly, we weren't going to be leaving our suite as much as we normally do in Vegas.  It was too awesome to miss out on.

The service our entire time here, exceeded our expectations.  We were spoiled rotten.  We ordered breakfast in the room several times and besides being delicious, the service was quick and the set up was PERFECT.

The in room amenities were so ON point.  From the lighting to the temperature of the rooms, to the heated toilet seat (has a booty wash feature too), to the toothbrush, toothpaste, razors, vanity sets.. and on and on and on available for your use.  Everything in its place and top quality.  One of my favorite features was the turn down service every night.  You come back to your suite to find everything cleaned up, the bed turned down, slippers on each side of the bed and a lavender balm to apply to help you sleep.  Oh yeah, don't forget the gourmet chocolates either.

015FWi5C0YOLv4JqX-4hag,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,D3dAx-QW_uuClz4MambeHA,3,5,3,4,"I'm a little befuddled as to why I haven't reviewed LGO yet. There must be a reason. It's not like I haven't been here yet. As a matter of fact, it's the opposite. I've been here many, many times. But still not inspired to write something. That strikes me as a little odd. 

Anyway.

This is reviewing just the grocery/cafe part of LGO - the pizzeria deserves its own review some other time. Now, if any of you are familiar with San Francisco, there's a small upscale grocery mart near Dolores Park called Bi-Rite, which is right by the pizzeria for Delfina, which in turn is right by the Tartine French bakery (and also the Dolores Park Cafe). I don't know exactly when LGO opened here in Phoenix, but it seems to have mushed all these concepts together and came up with this establishment. When I first walked in here 18 months ago, I thought, ""This is odd. It reminds me more of home than Phoenix."" Varied wine selection, high end pasta and sauces, open chaotic kitchen, the list goes on. Except for the bit where they sell useless candy (marshmellow Peeps are and ALWAYS have been nasty ass) and dumb books on how to name your dog or cat (I mean, come on, if you really need a book on how to name your dog, should you even have a dog in the first place?). 

But on the flip side, playing great CDs from the Putamayo record label over the soundsystem is very Bay Area, and when I came across some San Francentric books - cookbooks for the aforementioned Tartine and Delfina as well as Chez Panisse and the SF Farmers Market), as well as SF's 7x7 Magazine, I became even more suspicious about where these guys were getting their ideas from. 

Up until this point, I've just described what it's like walking in here. Eating here is another story. There's a small side patio which fills up pronto around weekend breakfast time. No misters over the summer though so I guess people just bake outside, since there's only a tiny smattering of two-tops inside and a couple more out the front door. If you're here for weekend brunch, the line is usually out the door and someone will come by to take your order. A decent selection of dishes, from croque monsieur to healthy all egg-white omelettes, but nothing I've eaten here has ever been out of this world (sometimes bordering on bland). I've never had the sandwiches for lunch, though, and I'm going to guess that they're better than breakfast, but I'll cross that bridge (and maybe edit my review) when I get there. 

That said about the food, the coffee is pretty damn good, I'll hand them that much. However, there is a sense of chaos in the place when you have to pick up your food order from one counter and your coffee order from another. 

As for the scene, well, much can be made of it. LGO is located smack in the middle of Arcadia, and sure you get some uppity folks driving in their Mercedes convertibles, and this seems to be the reputation that LGO is saddled with (for better or worse) - but by and large almost everyone who eats there is just regular and unpretentious (otherwise I would have never returned after that first time). 

In the end, though, I'd say this about LGO: it's a pleasant place to sit outside on a weekend once in a while (if you're lucky enough to nab a table, that is, and it's not too hot). Inside, the store is stocked with a lot of interesting and upscale and sometimes useless stuff you'll probably never buy. The breakfast food is fine, but for me not worth all the effort of the wait and the table/parking sharking. The coffee, though, is excellent, including their famous Spanish lattes. 

However, since LGO seems to be one of a kind in the Phoenix metro, many people just keep coming here by default, and I do find there's a lot of unjustified hype about this place. Maybe it gives off a certain ""aura"". Who knows. I just know the next time I go back to LGO, it will be on a random day at 3 in the afternoon, with a parking space waiting (hell, MANY parking spaces waiting for me), no line of people whatsoever inside, an open table indoors, a leftover but complete Sunday New York Times, and an excellent sandwich which is destined for my mouth.

Oh, and no Peeps on display. Especially those pink ones. Because they're nasty.

But I'm in no hurry to be back. There's still the rest of Phoenix metro to explore...

The only reason I'm giving it an extra star is because they gave us two free mochis icecream at the end which was a nice treat. I think that they give you the icecream instead of fortune cookies. Overall,  I will not be returning here for pho which was really disappointing.",2016-05-20 20:43:33

I'm a huge eggs benny fan so usually, I'll try out their traditional before I ""venture out"", if I dare.  I'm glad I did because the it was unbelievable.

Philly Cheesesteak Eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious.  Although the portion was very generous, I finished the entire thing.  It came with very tender strips of beef with delicious onions, green peppers and mushrooms.  This was then topped with perfectly poached eggs and their delicious hollandaise sauce. The dish looked absolutely amazing that a woman in line came up to our table and asked what I was eating.  After my brief review, she was sold. No doubt she enjoyed it as much as I did. 5/5.

Fries - My favourite kind of fries are fresh handout fries.  Just looking at their fries (and eventually trying them), only makes me dream of what their poutine would be like.  5/5.

Clubhouse Sandwich - Very generous with their meats that also had a lot of flavour.  Sometimes the deli meats are pretty bland and are lacking but theirs is quite good. 5/5.",2017-02-20 21:15:44

The space is really nice inside, they did a great job converting it from what was once City Tavern and then LaVecchia's (hard to believe it's the same space!). There's also a patio for those nice weather days. I loved the vibe when we first arrived, but like I said it got crazy in there. The bartenders were friendly and quick to take our order. 

We decided to do a couple rounds of appetizers - including the pork belly steamed bun and shrimp steamed bun, shrimp & grits, and the apple endive salad.

The ordering process was a bit chaotic and disorganized but once I figured out what I was going to order, I was not at all disappointed. As a newbie mistake, I ordered a large cheese steak (which ended up being enough food to feed a small village). I am 5'11' and 240 lbs and half of this sub put me to the point of bursting. While $12 seemed a bit expensive for my meal, I quickly changed my opinion on the matter when I realized that it would feed me for at least 2 meals.

Besides being massive, the sandwich was also amazingly delicious. It can't even be compared with the likes of Subway, Jimmy John's, or Quiznos. They are simply nothing alike and Dibella's is a million times superior to those places. The bread is what makes all the difference.

My server was rather indifferent, but I did get what I ordered, which was a scrambled eggs and bacon plate. The bacon was crisp and easily the best item, the home fries were actually potato wedges with some seasoning, and the toast was plain old sliced bread.

Because they are, really. I can't think of many times that I have had a cookie where I can taste every single ingredient in each bite.

I'm not joking. Upon first bite of an Urban Cookie (I like to imagine a Blood Cookie yelling ""Wut up B!""), let's say the amazing Pineapple Coconut, you taste a savory buttery flavor, then an intense, and I mean intensely tart dried pineapple. The sugar, both in the batter and the toasted coconut that tops the upper layer of the cookie helps cut through the tartness and leaves a great moistness in the mouth.

The cashier at the grocery store, check.  The mailman, check.  The toddler's teachers, check.  I swear I must have drank the kool aid because I have to spread the word.  

First of all complimentary mimosas and bellinis.  Decent ones too at that.

While her sandwich looked good, I only had eyes for my own.  Three layers of fresh, fried corn tortillas layered with green chili pork, refried beans, fresh salsa, cheese and topped with creamy scrambled eggs.

(When I am looking at ratings and deciding on whether to check out a place, I don't think 3 stars is too bad.... but certainly 4 or 5 is better.) 

And with Jake's, I was really unsure what to expect given that we first heard about it from an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.   (Now, I know Guy Fieri can be controversial and has just as many haters as fans.  I don't know anything about his cooking ability or his restaurants, but as a TV personality, I find him to be very entertaining.)  

I had also spoken with several folks who went to Jake's who thought it was just ""meh"".  But, not to be deterred, I wanted to go check it out and make up my own mind.

Well, I must say, I am glad that I did.  Overall, I liked the place.  On the day of my visit (a weekday around 12:30), I found the service to be a bit lacking, but the food made up for it. 

The special of the day was chicken & waffles.  Even though I'm  a southern-born & raised  girl, nobody in  my family ever made chicken & waffles. So, it was high time that I tried it.  

The waffle batter is made in house, and for lunch you got 2 fair sized waffles (not too big, not too small) that were cooked just right - light & fluffy. Then, they took 3 chicken strips and breaded & fried them to a deep golden brown (not burnt, but perfectly crispy).  But the absolute perfect topper here is the cajun syrup that they serve over this combo.  The syrup, made in-house, is the perfect mixture of a hint of sweetness with a bite of red pepper flakes and other cajun seasonings, resulting in a perfectly complex flavor profile that had me wishing for more!  

The chicken strips were sort of on the small side, so if you are a big burly guy, you might want to think about ordering an appetizer or side item to fill you up... but for me, the amount of food was just right. 

Now, this isn't the healthiest thing on the menu, but it sure was tasty!  This dish was $10 and well worth it in my book. 

I noticed that a  lot of the items on the lunch menu are fried, but there was at least one salad option that sounded appealing to me if you are hankering for something on the healthier side. 

The dinner menu was a little more pricey (still not overly expensive), but I noticed a lot of options that sounded delish and not all were fried.  Apparently, they recently started serving beer & wine because my server mentioned it to me.  This is a nice option if you decide to head out here for dinner.

The place is really out in the middle of nowhere, but if you live anywhere along 485, just take it out to Albemarle Road.  The place is an old gas station but they have it fixed up so it has a cool vibe to it. 

I am looking forward to another visit soon to check it out again!",2012-12-06 19:53:09

Vegas has a lot of restaurants (in case you didn't know) so the fact that these two felt strongly about eating at the same spot twice in a three day trip bode well for our meal.

And holy moly roly poly.  I'd eat here every day if I could.  First of all, the place is darling.  It feels intimate and the decor is vaguely dollhouse, a great spot for a fancy tea party.  Or brunch, I suppose.  The service - stellar.  The presentation is sweet, with bread in individual tins and hot chocolate served in a fancy pot.  But most important - the food is superb!  

I started with a warm portobello mushroom soup that was poured out of a beautiful little teapot over some little lobster raviolis.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of planting my face in, with deep flavor and that perfect buttony mushroom texture.  After polishing that off like a starved orphan, I moved on to an outstanding steak salad with balsamic, blue cheese, bacon, and more mushrooms.  That was another clean plate.  I finished out the meal (hey, it was my last of the trip, don't judge) with a gorgeous parfait with plenty of berries and lemon custard that was out of this world.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their food as well, and the miscellaneous bites I stole were all fantastic.

The new ""Booze District"" in Henderson is a very welcome addition - not just to the area, but to Las Vegas in general.  This city is SO far behind when it comes to beer, it's incredible.  

So, this place is located in a business park, which is standard for tasting rooms.  There isn't as much parking as I would think is necessary, especially when the 1st row is roped off for food trucks.

Inside is nice.  There is plenty of seating - with 2 high top bar tables, stools at the ""bar,"" and then benches around the perimeter of the room.  There also looked to be a large bean bag, in front of a TV that has video games.  They also offer darts and cards against humanity, which is awesome.

I wish that they would've put a large window on the wall looking in to the brewery. But overall, it's a great environment. I personally may have designed the room differently, but I am certainly not complaining.

My one complaint is probably how hot it was in the tasting room. They had fans going, but we all know that doesn't do much in the Vegas heat.  They may want to look in to getting some swamp coolers or something until it cools down.

I think this place will be very successful - they are personable, friendly and enthusiastic. And they are ahead of the game by being the first brewery open. 

I did a flight, tasting 5 out of the 6 available beers. Here they are, in the order I tried them:

Ante Up Amber: 5.7% ABV. This was probably my least favorite of the beers. Although I can't put my finger on why.

Ace in the Hole: Basil Pale Ale, 5.6% ABV. This was my favorite. It was light and refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. The basil flavor was great, but not overpowering.

The Daily Grind: Pale Ale, 5.7% ABV. This was hoppier than I would have expected. I liked it a lot.

Hoppy Times: IPA, 7.3% ABV. I didn't find this to be THAT much hoppier than the previous beer, but it was definitely good.  Hoping that they make a DIPA sometime - or even a Triple IPA. This hop head wants more! 

Gutshot: Dry Irish Stout, 4.5% ABV. This was probably my 2nd favorite beer. There was the immediate smell of chocolate, with a good coffee finish. 

After speaking with the Brewer's wife (I've already forgotten her name - Sorry!), she wouldn't let me leave without trying the 6th beer - Bluffing isn't Weisse: Hefeweizen, 5.1% ABV. This isn't usually my style of beer, and this was no exception. It tasted way too much like a Belgian beer for me. Although I could see others liking it, especially during the summer.

I decided to join their ""High Rollers"" club. I am looking forward to my 1st growler fill and receiving discounts and getting first dibs on new releases.  I live really close by, so I am excited to have them in the area and look forward to seeing them grow the beer community here in Vegas!",2014-07-15 21:19:11

My brother kept raving about how great this place was and I can see why he loves it so much. However, for me, soup noodles need a strong soup base, and unfortunately Magic Noodle, though with fantastic QQ noodles, is below par on its soup, and I have trouble rating it as a 4 star place. Between my mom, my brother, and I, we had marinated pig's ears and intestines, and three noodle dishes. My mom got the orginal lanzhou ramen noodles, I got the spicy intestine knife-cut noodles, and my brother got the cold ramen noodles. The cold dishes were just okay, while both type of noodles are fantastic. The only weird thing is that the ramen is not cut and it goes on forever, which makes it difficult to share. You can ask them for scissors if need be. Again, the soup bases were really meh. The cold dishes were kinda gross cuz the intestines were full of fat. .

What did wow me, however, is there house chive/garlic leek boxes. The stuffings were so full and delicious - i believe it is the best i've ever tasted. I would go back for those, and maybe a noodle on the side. 

The services is really great there but i am hesitant to give this place a 4 star, as I'm just not crazy about eating there in general.",2014-01-03 10:21:02

If you're in the mood for good food and you don't mind crappy customer service, then this place will suit you just right. 

I've been to sushi kaya many times in the past and wasn't always impressed with their customer service. The main reason I come back is for the decent pricing and good food. I even had my birthday dinner here last year. Their sushi selection is good and the AYCE menu has a variety of appetizers and tapas. I can't remember how much the lunch AYCE price is but dinner is ~$25 which is pretty competitive compared to other sushi joints around town. Aside from the food, their service totally got in the way and ruined my likes for this place. They're open until 3am but last call is at 2:15am. I opted not to get AYCE because we got there at 2am and 15 minutes was definitely not enough time for me to order a crap ton of food. I ended up getting stuff from their regular menu (kimchi fried rice $8.95 and four pieces of agedashi tofu $5.95) while a couple of my friends did AYCE. While my friends were ordering, the waiter kept interrupting them saying they were not allowed to share their food with myself and another friend since we were ordering stuff from the regular menu. We could tell he was not happy that they were doing AYCE right before closing time. It was just a huge disappointment. If you're gonna offer hours of service until a specific time, have the decency to honor and uphold it! They were pretty quick with bringing our food out but that's probably because we were the only guests there, aside from a couple that were seated a little before us. Near the end of our meal, they came by to ask how we were doing. My friends were missing a couple of their orders so they went to check. The waiter argued that we had received the orders already and defaulted the blame on the server, excusing her because she's still training. Regardless of the fact that she is new, he should not have argued with us. It was not professional by any means. We finished eating and continued to sit there to chit chat but noticed that it got extremely cold around 2:40ish. I'm not sure if they cranked up the a/c to get us out or if they just had a door open. We paid our bill and there was still 20 minutes left before closing time. We probably should have left right away since we knew they were closing but we were in the middle of a great conversation which was interrupted by the waiter. He came over to tell us that we had to leave because they were closing. I totally understand but it was very awkward. He didn't walk away from our table until we got up to leave. It's not like we were gonna camp out there all night.

I wasn't happy walking out of there. I'll probably come back again but it will definitely not be my first choice.",2013-12-31 13:41:46

When I walked through the doors of this lovely new bistro my first thought was it is delight to look at. The bar is beautiful and the dining room is rich without being overdone. My lunch was a very crisp, fresh BLT on warm, herb crusted bread with a bowl of corn chowder. I washed all of this down with a great glass of white wine. I might add, it was an exceeding healthy pour. Everything on my plate was fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed this bistro and plan to make it to for their wine dinner on March 24th.

The sangria was just ok but I was impressed that they had white and red sangria. 

Dessert is a must try!  We shared the rice pudding and it was the most unique rice pudding I have ever had.  I would definitely come back.

GNzlkf5HBWx43t5PiHZ3rg,rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,4,1,1,1,"Pizza Rock is one of the better pizza places in town (Naked City is still #1 for me). I really like variety when it comes to pizza, and Pizza Rock certainly has variety. The only problem with variety is that it can be a challenge to agree on a pizza when ordering for a group. They don't do half pizza which is unfortunate, but their pizzas are small enough to order a few for the table, though they can get expensive. A few coworkers and I came for lunch on a Tuesday and ordered the Fratellanza ($32). This is one of the only large pizzas they have (technically ""giant Sicilian style""). The pizza was indeed giant and is said to serve up to 5 people. Well, I had two slices and my two coworkers finished off the rest so if you're super hungry this could easily fill up 3 people. The slices came in a square shape with thick, slightly overcooked crust. It was simple pizza but great flavors. Could have used a few more mushrooms. I highly recommend this for anyone not knowing what to order because the others are a bit overwhelming. 

Pizza Rock has a great beer selection but the prices are steep. I ordered a weiss draft beer for $8.50 and my coworker got a bottled 12 oz Weihenstephaner for only slightly less. Even their local beers are around $7.50. Can't order very many of these at that price. I guess the only other thing that turns me off about Pizza Rock is the decor and theme. It feels really Hard Rock Cafe to me. Combined with the prices it makes me only want to come here on special occasions because it's more of an event or comparable to a Strip restaurant. The pizza is really good though and if I'm downtown and it's late I have been known to stop by their takeout counter. The Picante by the slice is amazing.",2017-11-08 20:51:08

Great atmosphere, great service but the food just wasn't that great. I got the fire chicken, the flavor was a little bland and there was nothing spicy about it. Tried the pork belly and it was incredibly dry. The pork rinds were you know- pork rinds, nothing special there. The pimento cheese was just ok but the chips or whatever those things are that come with it has zero taste.

We finally were able to have a ""team dinner"" and made our way over to this joint after making a reservation on a weekday. The joint was busy already by the time we walked in and continued to be busy as the night progressed. The joint itself has enough tables for groups and tables along with a bar hosting a suite of drinks. 

We were seated in the middle of the dining room with our group of 10 people eagerly awaiting our menus/meals. The server was very helpful and very quick to provide anything the group needed. I was certainly excited to see the ""Korean spin"" given my roots on southern bbq. After perusing the menu, the group decided to order the beef ribs, pulled pork, the pork belly, and the fire chicken for meats. We then proceeded to order the wings along with the ramen mac and cheese, the kimchi  fries, and tacos. We accompanied all this food with of course some soju . The food came out fairly quickly on large platters and we were all able to get a flavor of all the different food. Starting with the sides, the kimchi fries were delicious and simple and offered a good way to start the meal and great for any fry lovers. The ramen mac and cheese was good although it seemed just more standard mac and cheese then the fusion flavoring I was searching for but still a solid dish. The tacos were delicious and they all disappeared fairly quickly from the table. The meats were all very tender and well cooked. The beef rib came out on a huge bone and was tender off the bone. The pulled pork was again delish with the meat being tender and the marinade being just right on them. The pork belly was crispy on the outside with the frying process and were good. I think they were probably my least memorable but definitely worth a buy especially with groups. The fire chicken was BOMB. The chicken is honestly so juicy and tender and just packed with flavor. My buddy and I were busy inhaling all bites of this and instantly regretted when we ran out of it. The chicken wings were also good. They were standard wings to me that I could get anywhere else so no fusion aspect which was slightly disappointing but overall all the food was very good.

I am glad that I was able to check this place out prior to leaving Charlotte. It certainly has great service, great food, and a fun atmosphere. This is definitely worth a  stop for any people in Charlotte and for any BBQ lovers.",2017-10-26 21:56:28

The restaurant is on Main, between Stapley and Gilbert in the old ""Golden Fork"" building.  The interior is Mex Style with faux adobe, artwork and the like.  We were seated promptly for lunch and immediately brought chips and salsa.  Both were good.  Our server promptly took our order. We both had Lunch Special ""2"" which is a taco+enchilada served with beans and rice.  Plates were super hot, beans were good, rice was good but it ended for me there.  The cheese enchilada was bland and the taco meat too ""Fake"" tasting.  It had that taco seasoning flavor.  I was genuinely underwhelmed by the place.  It wasn't bad, wasn't good.  The carpet in the restaurant is filthy and must be replaced (this time put in tile) I found the carpet a that a little off putting.  $6.50 for a lunch special which is good.

Not awful at all, but not my favorite burger joint and I've other places I prefer for a burger.  They do have a great patio that overlooks the Biltmore, which always provides good people watching.

First, our food came out in weird order.  I split a Chinese chicken salad with someone and we also decided to split the zuchinni fries as well. We each ordered a burger, however the fries came out first, then the salad, then the burgers. Odd.  Who doesn't serve fries with a burger.

The chicken salad was pretty blah.  NOt a lot of flavor at all.  I didn't taste any hint of sesame, the base of Chinese anything, and it was a bit watery.

The zucchini fries were fantastic.  great crunch, not soggy at all, hot when served.

The burgers:  I ordered the Zinburger, the original.  It was fine, but nothing to write home about. I think for me it was the onions that threw me off. I love onions of all forms.  These were made in wine and I just didn't care for it, plus my burger needed some seasoning.  I did like the addition of the manchengo cheese. Yum.  The burger was cooked perfectly.

Parker & Sons looked at the unit & said I needed $250 worth of repairs so I had it done.  Then at the end of August 2014 the called letting me know I was due for a checkup.  I had stupidly bought the service package for around $400.  I made the appointment.  The day of the appointment the tech called to say it was too hot to check the heater.  Being from Chicago I wasn't aware of the limitations and wondered why the person who called even made the appointment.  Move forward to the beginning of Oct 2014 & another appointment.  I was told by the tech it was still too hot to run the heater to see if it is working properly but he said he would check the A/C unit while he was here.  10 minutes later he is telling me I need $1000 worth of repairs and since it is a 10 year old unit he suggested a new A/C system.  A sales rep came out and quoted me $7500 for a new unit and then they also sell a 10 year warranty which adds to the cost.  Luckily I have a friend who just had 2 units installed by Pyramid Mechanical and I had them come out.  Randy at Pyramid Mechanical came out, looked at the A/C unit & told me I did not need a new unit.  The vibration is normal.  He said if I really wanted a new unit it would be approximately $4500 installed and the unit has a 10 year warranty, no extra cost.

I am not getting a new unit and I will not use Parker & Sons again even though I bought the service deal for 2 years.  That purchase was a lesson learned & I won't do that again.

The food is also decent. It's at McKibbin's where I fell in love with sweet potato fries! There is also a stage for the occasional bands. I've heard two play which were mediocre at best. Surprisingly a lot of security but I understood the need after I've seen a bad drunk threatening to get the Russian mafia to shoot the pub up after getting thrown out of a bar.

This was my second time in a more everyday setting:  happy hour on a Thursday night with three of my gal pals. We arrived by 5:30pm with half an hour to spare to get our cheap eats and drinks going.  Nerds that we are, my friends and I had already studied the menu online, so we had 99% confidence in our order hours before we arrived.  I knew I was getting the 2-for-$4 street taco deal(chicken, even though I'm reaching my chicken limit these days), and the Mexican-style corn on the cob (elote), plus one margarita, because that's really all I can handle for alcohol.  I figured that would be a fairly safe and healthy meal for dinner considering I was going to avoid rice, tortillas, and chips.  Well, I was disappointed in my street tacos.  I know they're supposed to be smaller, but there really was not that much chicken in them and no way am I going to reach my protein quota with those-not even 3 ounces between the two of them.  The corn on the cob, though, was muy delicioso!!  It's one ear of corn per order, cut in half.  I could have had two more orders, at least--who cares if the stuff gets stuck in your teeth?  I would return just for that.  Service was meh--no one really came to check on us once the food was delivered, which is always frustrating when your mouth is on fire (not mine) and/or you need to order more beverages, alcoholic or otherwise; I mean, we were sitting in the bar, after all.

The food was very consistent with their other location. The crispy roast duck was cooked to perfection and came with very rich gravy sauce. This sauce was salty at their other location, but here it came out not salty but on the sweeter side. It was really good with the duck, but not by itself with rice. The portion was slightly smaller here as well. 

The noodles and green beans were similar to the other location. Hot and sour soup was on the sweeter side. Overall, had a nice meal. I'd recommend.",2018-02-03 04:38:20

We started with the nachos. I have generally been disappointed by nachos at restaurants lately. Usually just a bag of chips with just a few toppings tossed on before heating. I was glad to find this pub style restaurant makes them the way they should be. Every chip with at least some delicious topping on it.
We split the entree, a grilled salmon and asparagus risotto. It was delicious. They kindly split it into two plates. It was devoured quickly.
In general this place has a great English pub feel. However, I still prefer the one at Tempe Marketplace just a few miles away. This is a great place for a lunch or early dinner while shopping at the state's top mall. It will also be great when the new Harkin's Theater opens a few hundred yards away.

We heard a lot of good things about the quality of food and decided to give it a try! Service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and did a great job portioning the amount of food. We came at around 6:30 pm and was very surprised to see a lot of empty tables, only one or two tables were taken. There is a sauce-bar close to the front of the restaurant for you to create your own dipping sauce. I chose a few items but I didn't really use the sauce throughout the night because the original seafood items were fresh and didn't need any additional flavour, or else it would've cover the freshness of the taste!
We ordered Combo B ($96 or $75 per person depending on if you're paying in cash or on card). 

How it works: It is similar to your traditional hot pot except everything is steamed. Your assigned server will cook the meal for you. Each item of your meal has a set timer. Once the food is cooked, the steamer would beep and your server would distribute the food for you. 

BROTH BASE:
* CONGEE (5/5)
I'd highly recommend choosing ""Congee / Porridge"" as the broth base. This broth is an additional $10 but I thought this was the best part of the meal! The congee absorbs everything that has been cooking in your steamer throughout the night so it becomes super flavourful. I usually haaate congee and I'm giving this a 5/5..!!

- COMBO B -

APPETIZERS:
* Grilled U.S. Certified Angus Beef kebab (4/5)
The beef was delicious! Very tender :)

* Grilled Spain Iberico Pork kebab (5/5)
What is thisss!? SO yummy! Its texture tasted like the meat from the pork's neck area. It's chewy and delicious.

SEAFOOD:
* Canadian PEI Lobster
* Vancouver Jumbo Clam 
(They weren't kidding about ""jumbo"" because the clam meat was actually pretty big haha).
* Canadian Fresh Oyster
* Saltspring Mussel
* Vietnamese Cuttlefish

SEAFOOD HIGHLIGHTS - My favourites from the seafood choices were the lobster, clams and oysters. They were all very fresh and delicious! Steamed oysters tastes exactly like raw oysters (or maybe it's because they didn't cook it for that long, but my dad insisted they were fully cooked haha). Mussels were mediocre and the cuttlefishes were fresh, but had barely any taste. The cuttlefishes were the only seafood item that we needed to dip extra sauce for.

VEGETABLES (6 choices in total):
* Mushrooms
* Pumpkin
* Lettuce
* Enoki mushrooms
* Fungi 
* Taro

DESSERT:
* Vanilla Ice cream with Pastry, Pudding",2017-03-16 12:59:44

I ordered the Scottish salmon entrée, and it was a significant disappointment. They asked me how I wanted it cooked, and I said it's up to the chef and they said it would be medium which I thought was perfect. It was overcooked! Anyone that does fish, especially salmon, knows that it needs to flake appropriately and anything over cooked just isn't all that good, especially when it comes to salmon. The salmon was not flaky, yet completely solid and dry. The sides of the dish were nothing to write home about. Also, on top of that, I ordered the couscous with cauliflower side. It too was way too dry for couscous. Huge disappointment.
What was really good, and this is why I gave the restaurant three stars, was the apple pie in a bag with homemade vanilla ice cream. It was really good.
I did not let them know that the salmon was overcooked because I don't think, in a restaurant of this caliber, that a chef should not be able to cook salmon properly which is so simple, even for me. 
Huge disappointment. Service is good. Due to the poor quality of the food, I will not likely be going back.

I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich on foccacia, which came with roasted peppers, mozzarella, and yum, sauteed spinach and garlic.  It would have been outstanding if they'd only heated the foccacia to crisp it up.  Instead of the fries or cole slaw, I sprang for the extra two bucks to change it up for a salad.  I expected a tiny side salad, but this was really big, with lots of chopped tomatoes, cuke, cheese, and romaine.  It was missing olives, but that was great:  I hate olives!  By the time I got halfway through the salad, I felt like I'd already eaten dinner.

My husband ordered the walleye special.  I thought it was pretty high-priced at $20, but it came with the aforementioned salad, plus two sides. But when they brought out the plate, I saw the reason for the high price: the piece of fish was absolutely monstrous.  It could have fed a small third-world nation, but my husband lives to eat, so he managed to devour half of it before throwing in the towel.  It became my dinner on Saturday night, and I thought it was fabulous!  I also appreciated the fact that it wasn't over-salted.  Next time we go we'll both order it, and we'll be able to eat for a week!

One of the other couples ordered the same as us.  The guy from the third couple had the burger with bratwurst and, I think, bacon, plus some kind of cheese.  He liked it a lot.  His wife wasn't feeling very well, so she just ordered some tuna salad on a plate.

Overall, I recommend this place if you're in the area. Great for large groups! The dishes aren't spectacular, but they are delicious enough to inhale completely when you're in a hungry rage. Also, very good tea!",2014-01-02 16:05:51

I had wanted to go for awhile, even though they got a large amount of negative reviews, but they were mostly about the restaurant and the fish quality, which I don't eat anyway so I figured it would be fun to try the vegetarian rolls. 

So we went in on a Sunday about 6pm, and there weren't very many people in here, which surprised me. We wanted to sit on the patio but it was full and we didn't feel like waiting the 20 minutes before a spot would open up. So we got a table next to the sushi bar near the back. There was one table full of drunk people behind us that was kind of obnoxious for 6pm, but they left shortly after we arrived so I can't complain too much about the atmosphere. It wasn't crowded, wasn't loud like most people complain about (I don't know if that has anything to do with the day we chose to come in), so far so good.

My sister and I ordered alcoholic beverages, mine was good, but I wish it had more alcohol, and the glass seemed really small. My husband and mom got the green iced tea. My mom liked it, my husband thought it was had a strange powdery flavor. 

We go over the menu and decide what we want. My sister, mom and husband chose a selection of fish type rolls, while I decided on the avocado roll, cucumber rolls, and vegetarian rolls. We also got three appetizers. Edamame, which was ok. A little salty for my taste. Pineapple wontons, which everyone said were good. And then we got the tofu appetizer. It was ok. I expected it to be crispier. The appetizers came out in a strange order. Not one of them came together. They all came separately, about 5-7 minutes apart. Which is weird, but wasn't too bad because there was enough food to keep everyone occupied. 

So after we finished our appetizers, the rolls came out and started filling up the table. I think we ended up with 8 kinds of rolls. I enjoyed my vegetarian rolls. They may have been simple, but they tasted good. I especially liked the avocado rolls. I love avocado. Everyone else said their fish rolls tasted really good. My husband especially liked the crispy calamari rolls. His eyes like rolled into the back of his head. Lol. But he is easily amused when it comes to food. 

We then decided on two of the deserts, desert sushi and banana rolls. They were both pretty good. I have had better deserts, but they weren't horrible. 

I think all in all we were there something over an hour and a half and spent about $120. It seems a little steep for what it was. But I would definitely come back for some take out veggie rolls. 

This place deserves a solid 3 stars based on my experience. I would rate it a 3.5 if I could. The food was good, the service was not too bad. There were some points in the meal where we wondered where our waitress went off too but she never disappeared for too long. All in all it was a yummy experience.",2011-03-25 19:05:00

Service: 5/5 The staff was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.

Enviorment: 5/5 The place is named Bootleggers so it's no surprise that you walk in and get that late 20s early 30s feel. The lighting is pretty dim and to add that extra bit of romance, there is a candle on every table; if this is a first date and you don't look exactly like your profile picture or the other person was a little tipsy when they gave you their phone number...this is the place for you! Besides the lighting, I LOVE the decor.

Food: 5/5 Most important part!!! I came here for the bacon board...Yummmy! I'm talking 5 different kinds of bacon with two spicy jams, home made mustard, pickles and cheesy bread. Yes it was $24 but my bf and I agreed that it was worth it! I would just go for bacon and wine if the opportunity ever presented itself. For entrees I got the turkey leg, coleslaw and mac n cheese and my bf got the brisket, coleslaw and black beans. We both loved our food but I wanted to give special attention to the mac n cheese...first off I'm super picky when it comes to mac n cheese because it is one of my favorite foods, and I usually never like mac n cheese outside of mine or my mom's...but let me tell you, AMAZING MACARONI AND CHEESE!!!

She highly recommended the pork belly snack and repeated said its their best. She was definitely right, the pork belly was extreme delicious. Ordered a pork belly ramen and the snack, was not wrong to get it twice. Only mistake was ordering the small. The cha siu is by far the best, compared to other ramen places. The soft boiled egg was really well done, the yolk was soft and sweet but not runny.

The disappointing thing was the noodle and the soup. The noodle resembled Chinese egg noodle, it was nothing like ramen. Probably the worse ramen tried to date. The soup was nothing special and combined with the noodles, it seemed like something that is served at a Chinese cafe.

Overall, maybe come back and try a donburi with a pork belly snack dish. Will definitely get a large next time, double the number of pieces.",2015-10-25 08:45:58

First off, the prices are pretty high. But it's in a row of ""high class"" dining (Samba, Stack, Japonais, etc.) so I can't really expect them not to keep in line with the local pricing.

The staff can be quite ""hovery"" one moment, and then ""disappeary""

I ordered the ""Dinner and a Show"" package which is $49 dollars and you can pick from a soup (well your pick is always Egg Drop because that's the only soup), appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I had the Pot Stickers, which were really good (and probably the highlight of the meal).  The Sweet and Sour Pork was good, but nothing exceptional.  The Dessert was Vanilla Brulee which was quite good with the added fruit.

The Ambiance is nice, but a bit dark, and it IS hard to forget that there is a casino right outside.

Overall I would say the price really is the biggest drawback. Between myself and my wife I spent more than I would for a dinner at The Melting Pot (Granted, this is more food for sure).  Since it was planned as our ""Expensive Dinner"" before the show I knew what I was getting into, but I would never just ""Stop in"" here for a meal.",2013-04-13 15:17:16
KrXYA21JP6Zn9Go5znWxMQ,sOZfGLRjhcEjAKBLZKcJGg,TBTVE-YzujCHrTqoAxL05A,4,4,2,2,"Super L is great, I really love a ton of their amenities. Unfortunately, it is an Asian Food City. That's OK though, I can dig an Asian Food City. Let me explain this spot.

~The Good~
The vegetable selection is out of this world. So many varieties, its hard to list them all. They offer Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) at the lowest prices in the valley. LOVE IT! So many different cabbages, and so on...I could go on and on. The meat selection looks good as well, especially the seafood, which has a ton of different fishes. The sake and Asian wine selections is also really cool, right above the frozen food beds filled with yummy frozen seafood.  The noodle and rice section, as expected, is overwhelming and filled with great choices. The sauces section is also huge, you forget sometimes how many sauces are featured in Asian cooking. Finally, I do not eat any baked goods normally, but the bakery looks really good. If I did eat treats on a normal basis, I'd come here.

~The Bad~
With the good comes the bad, especially the unsightly open tanks filled with the fish and seafood. It smells ""interesting"" in the meat/seafood section, hence the reason I usually do not get anything there. The fish are almost always sold whole....I prefer pre-cut, personally. I also do have a hard time with the sheer enormity of all the goods, most of them without much descriptions. I really have to do my homework either WHILE shopping or BEFORE shopping, or I will be buying something I have no clue about. It is an adventure, shopping here, nonetheless.

~The Down Low~
This place really is a 3.5 out of 5. 2 stars go out for the sheer amount of specialty Asian foods to select from, and another for the sake/beer selection....more than anywhere else in the valley. A 1/2 star goes out to the seafood selection, omitting some stars for the previously discussed issues I have with the meat/seafood section. Come here for anything food-wise you could want from Asia...just expect a wild trip going through the aisles, and remember to come prepared!",2013-12-31 19:58:03

Don't bother coming here. Servers are rude, food is salty and overhyped bc they got their friends to rave about it, and they illegally charge you for something they should never charge. I've been here with a few groups of people and every time has been a horrible experience.

My friend who works down the street suggested it and I didn't have any other suggestion so we ended up here. I will say that it was A-OK. I would have to try more of their food other than the appetizers to truly get a good feel for it but all that we did was to eat some appys and to drink some drinks. 

The good thing about this place is that its happy hour specials are pretty great. The drink specials are $5 for some pretty good cocktails and half off appys. I will say that the drinks were strong and they were really good. I would never pay full price for them tho, the size of them alone would make me say, nah...too small for the original price. 

We sat at the bar and just ordered our food and our drinks from there. The service was interesting to say the least. Halfway through our time there the server at the bar switched over. The first server was really nice and talked to us about the champagne orders that were coming in and even let us try a sip of a bottle that was opened. I thought that was nice and would even go so far as to say I will be ordering that if I come back. That is the type of service that I really appreciate. He was prompt with our drinks, offered great suggestions and was very friendly. The second server that came on was prompt, was nice, and was friendly. But when asked for suggestions or just to chit chat he wasn't having much of it. He was super nice, but it was just a little different. It was getting busier by that time so he could have been distracted, but a little chit chat would have been nice. But I guess you never know as a server what is too much and what might be enough. 

Drinks: 
Brown Derby: Bourbon/Honey/Grapefruit. This was really good. It came in a short squat glass filled with ice. I liked that the bourbon taste was diluted a bit with the honey and the citrus. It felt to me that it just didn't bite as much as usual. I would get this again. It was a bit stronger so I would say that I could only drink one of these and had to move to another. 

Honeysuckle: Rum/ Honey/Lime. Hmm do I see a pattern here? I just realized that I went with another drink with honey and citrus and just switched up the liquor. I guess I know what I like! This one was very good. It wasn't overly strong and was smooth going down. Rum is and easier drink to consume because it is basically a fruit. Or at least that is what I consider it. I would get this one again. 

Moscow Mule: Vodka/ Ginger Beer/ Lime. I just tasted this because my friend got it and after two drinks myself, I was done. It tasted like a moscow mule. Nothing fancy, just crisp and refreshing. I don't know if I would pick this as my go to drink, but it was good, a bar staple. 

Take Things Slowly: Gin/Lavender/Lemon. Again my friend picked this drink and I just had a few sips. I liked it a lot. I am not the biggest lavender fan but it had a really nice taste to it. Refreshing and cool. I do not know if I would get it because again, the lavender taste could get to me after a bit. But a few sips was nice, and if you can handle lavender this is the drink for you. 

The drinks were really good and I would say for $5, that is a good way to spend an hour or two hanging out with friends and sipping some cool ones. 

Now on to the appys!!

Appetizers:
Seasonal Vegetable Tempura soy-dashi vinaigrette /ask server for daily veggies. This is the part where the second server made me laugh and shake my head. We asked what the daily veggies were and he was like..""they are good, just get them, I don't know what they are, maybe sweet potatoes, carrots, and beans."" It was really good. The soy dashi vinaigrette was phenomenal. The veggies were sweet potatoes, green beans, carrots, zucchini, and mushroom.  I really liked picking at this bowl. The tempura was thin enough that the breading wasn't over kill and then was still crispy enough to make an impression. The veggies were fried to perfection, not overly soggy and had a nice crunch to them still. But the star was that dipping sauce!!

Gyoza (6): pork / cabbage / dumplings / onions / scallions soy-ginger vinaigrette. Ok, confession, we ordered two of these. Yes, we ate 12 dumplings. They were good. The normal gyoza fair. They tasted just as I expected and not anything more or less. The sauce was really good too. I liked the veggie one better but still. This was a nice snack, so nice, we ordered that second dish. I liked that they were made perfectly with a little bit of the pan frying and the steamed. It makes me want to go out and get a bag and have a little gyoza night. 

Chicken Bao (2)pulled chicken / japanese aioli / bib lettuce  steamed bun. I would pass on these if I had the choice. I picked these, and actually it was my choice, because I have been eating a lot of pulled pork and wanted to do something different than the pork baos. These were a bit dry for my taste. I dipped them in the vinaigrette!!",2017-10-14 13:51:45

took the same shopping list of items i already procured at von's for a comparison test to this walmart near a friend's house.  this walmart was very clean. i was immediately lost since i don't frequent this area of town.  i made casual inquiries to shoppers as to where to find things in this store and they were so friggin friendly and helpful.  got me wondering, is it the people/customers of walmart or is it the area of town?  i came from summerlin where they voted no against a walmart in their back yard, but i have no doubt you'll find those same shoppers  at a nearby walmart every weekend (the snobs that they are won't admit it though).  had a large shopping order to complete that encompassed both ends of the store.  got it done with customer's directions in less than an hour.

I'd like to point out that the TJ's I used to frequent (Scottsdale, AZ) does not carry hard liquor. So I almost squealed (actually I did) when I saw that the beer and wine wall was longer and had my beloved Knob Creek. I love that you can totally buy booze here. Yeah! 

The thing I love most about Trader Joe's is that I trust what they are selling. I view their products as being high quality and low cost. I can write a grocery list and food budget knowing what their prices are going to be. Take milk for instance, a gallon here at regular price is as low as most big box grocery stores charge for milk that's on sale. Same with eggs, butter, yogurt, well you get the idea. Don't show up expecting to buy Coke and Pepsi as TJ's stocks mostly their own brands though they have TJ versions of most major items. 

My only problem with this location is that the parking lot during peak hours is messed up and awkward. However Id like to point out that most parking lots in Las Vegas are pretty messed up and make little to no sense. That felt good to get off my chest. The sweet spot visitation time is around 2pm. You can park close to the entrance and there wont be much of a line.

Speaking of drinks, one of the more affordable places to grab a cocktail.  In addition, their specialty cocktails benefit local charities.  I had the Afterschool Mule which benefits After School All Stars and my husband had the Opportunity Gin and Tonic which benefits Opportunity Village.  Both were delicious.

A note about food - they serve John Mull's meats - a local company with great quality food.  If you're looking for a meal you're limited to kielbasa, hot links or brats.  Not a bad thing, just be prepared.",2017-01-16 00:21:33

It was busy, but not ridiculously so. There were 7 of us & we had Set Menu A (pancit, lumpia, soup, etc) & added things to it. The food was good, a lot like homemade food.  I found it a tad too oily for my taste.  The service was okay. We had one waiter who then started serving another table behind us because we seemed to be taking too long to decide what to eat for his liking. The new waiter we got was courteous when telling us that some menu items weren't available. He seemed over worked though. Poor guy looked really tired with bags under his eyes. 

As for the décor of the place it's pretty basic. Middle of the road tables & chairs. The place is so full of tables & chairs there isn't really any space for much else décor. Dress code is casual. Overall the experience was ok. But if I wanted to go out for a nice dinner this would not be it.

The service is fast, they get your bill speedily and the portions are great but that could be due to the fact I always, always, always get their bento boxes.

It is 10x more frustrating to get home, open the bag, and see your order is incorrect. Your only options are to eat it, go back to get it corrected, or toss it. None of these options are good.

It was so noisy that it was hard to hear and understand the questions, and the questions were impossibly hard so it made it boring. The only fun rounds were the picture rounds, the music rounds and multiple choice because we didn't need to strain ourselves trying to hear the guy mumbling out the questions at the front of the bar while we sat at the back. 

Quiz night would be awesome IF AND ONLY IF they posted the questions on the TVs around the bar so that we don't need to strain ourselves trying to hear or they spoke up.

This place is conveniently located across from the North York Civic Centre and the interior has a nice urban vibe to it with a couple of large tv's.   It is more an ""pub feel"" to Indian food.  

Appetizers: 
a)Nawab Veg balls: these were delicious.  There were lots of nice herbs in there.
b)Green Poutine: I'm not a big fan of fries, but they were nice and crispy with good flavour.
c) Lolipop Chicken: this was probably my favourite of the night.  The chicken was very tender and it was like a mix of tandoori and chilli chicken (but a lot less spicy) on a little skewer
d)Beef Seekh kebob: To be perfectly honest, while I know the chef tried hard to cook well for 30 people, I think he tried too hard and over-cooked these. The meat was kind of tough.  

However, I thought most of the apps were delicious - so for the apps, probably 4/5. 

Dinner: 
a)Saffron Chicken - like a sweet butter chicken.  It was white meat and some of tablemates didn't like it that much, but I thought it was pretty good.  
b)Lamb Slider - the lamb inside was very well cooked, however I think the naan bread needed a bit of work.  I'm not sure but it wasn't as ""hot"" as I like it.
c)Channa Masala - this was actually my favourite entree. Thought this was amazing channa.  
d) Rice - very fragrant
e)Plain and whole wheat naan - naan was okay, but I've had better.

So for entrees I would give this place a 3/5

So in essence, this gives the place a score of 3.5/5.  However, I'll round up to 4 stars because the owner and servers are all very pleasant and accommodating.  

Oh yeah, and I had a fresh lime juice.  MY GAWD! this was off the hook (yes I know, no one says that anymore, sue me).  It basically tasted like a mojito but virgin.  SUPERB!

The mabo men was delicious as well, not being too spicy and perfect for those who want noodles without having soup.

Lol The line up was so long outside but when we finally got in, it was a lot more empty than we expected! Those bouncers should definitely get fired because all they cared about was letting people who paid them go in and the people who didn't were forced to stay in line until they give up and pay or leave. We were sooo close to paying the Evil bouncers but luckily he announced that they were at max cap so a swarm of people left making us next in line. They let us in 15 minutes later. 

I love the vibe and concept of this place because hence the name, it's a mock house party type of party place. It's made to look like you're at a house party which is soo fun and unique! There's tvs inside, a long table that resembles a dining table, small tables where people can sit, play board games and chat. There's also table hockey and jits, etc. The first time I came here I only stayed inside because it was cold. This time we went to the patio and it was soooo nice! There's tea lights hanging from above outside and pillows on the deck where people an sit around like a camp fire. There's booths surrounding the patio with tables down the centre where people sit, chill and play board games. The best part is that it wasn't your typical club place where the music is too loud and makes you want to rip your ears out. It's a great place to chill and still be able to communicate with your friends comfortably without losing your voice the next day. There's also a life size connect 4 which was cute.

The next best thing is we weren't even planning to have a booth but we decided last minute that we wanted one and they were able to set us up. There was No minimum too!! How rare is that!?!?

I had avoided Pizza Rock the first couple days staying at the Grand next door,  because during the day, the joint was empty - - and loud, and dark - - couldn't imagine sitting there at a table like a stooge.

The last night in Vegas, with the vintage hot rod show outside, needed some tucker so took a stool up front by the slice counter (thanks, Yelper Lauren T for this recommendation!)  and ordered the Sicilian slice of the day (deep crust - - foccacia?) and the Picante (basic 'American style' slice).

OH MY BLOODY HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GRACE were these slices great.   Pizza Rock is not so much pizza as art - - it is pizza as SCIENCE,  and the science at Pizza Rock is not myopic test tube, it is more like transcendent astrophysics.

The Sicilian had a crust that was solid and toothy, but then disassembled as you bite into it - - a crunch and a melt at the same time, with beautiful light delish tomato accent.   This is a pizza with a structure like the scaffolding that held Michelangelo up while painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

The Picante presented itself modestly - - simply a thinnish slice studded with eye-poppingly colorful toppings with bright white mozzarella blobs - - a slice from a larger pie, re-heated 30 seconds before being served - - and the message was clear:  at Pizza Rock they have the formula.  They know precisely what they are doing with the alchemy of crust and topping (and top, top ingredients at that) to create masterpieces of texture and flavor.

Not JUST art.   But also science.",2018-04-30 02:42:29

I'm glad we did because from ease of ordering, customer service and food, it was a pleasant experience. The menu has many different selections from sandwiches to pizza. We decided to go with the pizza and we were not disappointed. They're the size of a personal pizza and they were delicious, from the thin flavored crust to the fresh ingredients; there were no complaints. We did have an issue with the pizzas not being made correctly but after informing management, they took care of it immediately with no issue. 

The customer service and wait staff are wonderful and very accommodating. I definitely agree with all the other rave reviews on Newk's Cafe. We will be making more trips over here in the future. I highly recommend Newk's and wish they were closer.",2015-08-23 16:06:52

I tend to order more than I could eat, so coming in as a bigger group has its advantage hehehe... all their dishes are great for sharing. They have also added lunch specials from 9am-2pm for only $6.95 - it comes with a bottle of water or a can of pop! #awesomedeal. I believe there is also student discounts too if you show your student ID(?). Unfortunately, not applicable to me... boooooo :( lol.

More highly recommended items:
 
1) Grilled Lemongrass Half Chicken with Vermicelli - Thank you, Yelpers! You guys are super right about this dish... SO WORTH GETTING. Chicken was so fresh and tender, definitely worth the 20 minutes wait. I believe you can change vermicelli to rice option as well :)

2) Green Curry with Seafood - can be paired it with rice noodles, rice or roti :) It was very creamy, you can definitely taste the sweet taste of coconut! It was also not too spicy (rated 2 out of 3 chilies). I couldn't stop eating lol. I really wish they could give me more roti - as a nice chew XD 

3) Fresh Tomato Vermicelli Noodle soup with ground shrimp, ground pork and egg drops - Other than the Thick Crab Noodle Soup, this would be another one of my fave noodle dish! The tomato broth was tasty, the fresh tomatoes really made a difference! Plus, all the ingredients really compliment each other.

4) Pineapple Fried Rice - not served in a traditional way on half of a pineapple, but presentation is still great (and delicious!) Why? because you can tell by the premium ingredients that they use - fresh herbs, jumbo shrimps, and lots of cashews! #lovecashews

Definitely check this place out if you're in the area! I'm just so happy for this great addition to our neighbourhood. Keep up the great work! #hohomi #thumbsup #supportlocalbusiness",2013-11-21 03:09:06

Hands down, it was the worst pulled pork I've had at a restaurant. It was tasteless and came out with so much liquid that the bun was soggy and inedible. I have no doubt that the pork was simply thrown into the restaurant version of a crock pot, doused with cumin and a couple other spices, filled with water and cooked for half a day or so.  Contrast that with good pulled pork, which is meticulously smoked in a smoker for many hours. This pork is actually similar to a Pioneer Woman recipe I use at home, minus the complex taste and good flavor.

I was a very nice place. I have never been to a Whole Foods. They have a nice selection of beers. A lot of them local. They have daily specials and on Fridays it is $6 beer flights. It was cool to be able to try a few different kinds of beer. You can pick 4 per flight. One I picked, Four Peaks Kiltlitter, is a favorite. Another one was recommend by someone and the other two I just kind of randomly picked. The waiter recommend one of the random ones. My girlfriend and I also ordered the Tots, an order of fries with the green chili cheese sauce and a rainbow sushi roll.
The service was ok. This location hasn't been opened too long so maybe everyone hasn't quite learned all of the roles yet. They are still working out the kinks. It almost seemed like they just assign people to work in certain areas and they were the ones that were assigned to the bar that night. To their credit it is seat yourself and they were pretty quick to notice new people had sat down but they didn't quite know how to be servers. It also most seemed like when our waiter came over for the drink orders that we had to order them right then or we wouldn't get them at all. With 30 beers to pick from it took a second to get choices down. But eventually everything was ordered and the drinks and food did come out pretty quick. Except they gave us plates that we really didn't need.
The food was great. The tots are pretty big for tots but so good. Especially with the dipping sauce. The green chili cheese sauce for the fries costs extra but is so worth it. Wow it was really good. Later on that night I had cheese sauce somewhere else and it didn't even come close to this stuff. The sushi was made fresh at the store's sushi station and brought over. All the food is made at the different parts of the store and brought over to the bar. You can even walk around the store with your drink and shop. You can also buy items and bring them back and eat them there as well. Just no shopping carts in the bar area. They are not allowed.
When the bill came I wasn't sure if we got charged for everything we ordered but it was hard to tell because they just had random charges on the bill but it wasn't more then it should have been so I didn't say anything.

It is very apparent that Massage 1 cares about their clients and wants them to have a great experience every time.

Excellent customer service can be hard to find these days, but it is alive and well at Massage 1.

It is a giant belly bomb with meat, cheese, bean, rice, sour creme, guac, and pico wrapped in a giant tort and then wrapped up in tin foil.  They are all over the bay area.  There basically isn't a taqueria within 100 miles of the bay that if you walked in and asked for a super burrito that wouldn't serve up this delight exactly like this for around 6 bucks.  I have actually carried on La Tapatia burritos multiple times through security at the airport when I come back from visiting home.    

Some of you might be saying, that is no big deal, sounds like chipotle.  Well Mr. Chipotle was working in S.F. and fell in love with these burritos and went back to denver and started up chipotle.  It's true, check it out on wiki if you don't believe me.  Now for me chipotle dozen't really cut it because it's like a watered down corporate version of what a S.F. burrito really is but thats another story.  Imagine a big chipotle burrito but made with the greasy salty food from roberto's and you are close to what it is all about.      

I digress, the owners of this place are from the bay area and they serve up the authentic thing.  If this place was in S.F. it would be a very average burrito place but considering we are in vegas and that this place is pretty legit it hits the spot for sure.  Their burritos are actually a little small for what is normally standard but in reality they are still plenty big enough for all but the biggest gluttons and they are under 6 bucks to boot.  Their 2 locations are the only places in vegas serving these up that I know of (besides chipotle and it's rip offs).  If you know of more help a brother out.   I am going to try their other and way closer location soon but I don't imagine it is any different.

FYI this place for some reason dozen't have rice on their super burrito so if you want the super authentic thing just ask for it and they will put it on, it's better with it IMHO.  

Their steak is all I have tried and it is quite tasty, it's lean, tender, and flavorful.  They advertise that they use sirloin.  Their chips are pretty awesome too and I overheard someone talking about how they have the best super nachos in the world so it's probably worth a try, they are under 6 bucks too.",2011-07-01 01:54:07

They offer a variety of combos with their food, which usually includes a drink and soup. Drink variety is tea, milk tea, or soy milk. Soup is either their ""borscht"" soup or cream soup. 

I ordered the special noodle soup that isn't on their main menu. It included fish cake, Chinese sausage, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodle I got was instant noodles. 

This dish was okay; you can definitely tell that the soup was instant as it had no real depth of flavour. Tastes more like salted water. Was $8.99, so not a bad deal.

Bf ordered the baked rice with seafood. This is his typical order, and for $11.99, it is incredible value. Comes with a drink and soup, as mentioned above.

They don't skimp on the seafood or the cheese sauce and the rice is nicely fried with onions and mushrooms. If I was to come back again, it will definitely be for their baked rice dishes.

We had heard it had just opened and there were lineups.  However later in the evening and I guess after the hype died down we headed over and luckily enough got a table.  There are only a few tables in here so you may be better to get takeout if it's busy.

The chicken is like a flat cutlet - it's kinda weird.  Bone in chicken that's flat.  We ordered one piece - the original (I think it was like $10) and some popcorn chicken that I think was about $6-7.  The cutlet is pretty big - if you just want a snack it's good for 2 people.  I believe we just kept is simple with one level of spice and got the pepper flavour.  The popcorn chicken pieces were bigger than other places but you got about 10 or so ""kernels"".  They were ok, nothing I would order again.  

It comes in a large blue/white bag - something like you would eat at the CNE to be honest.  this is exactly where this place would fit in.

We visited Cafe Monte for the first time during Queens Fest after riding past on a regular while visiting Whole Food. We were impressed with the staff upon arriving for our reservation and how nice they were and how quickly we were seated even though we were early.

Salads: I had a tasty arugula salad with grilled peaches atop and my husband had a duck salad that he devoured 
Main course: I had the scallop risotto and my hubby had the sword fish both were extremely tasty. 
Dessert: we both had the bread pudding which was amazing and even better with the ice cream that cost $5 for one scoop to share (Really).

It has a unique feature -- a nonworking elevator with a plexy glass floor and ceiling so that when an unsuspecting visitor is pushed in, they experience a moment of terror of plummeting to their death. 

And, the kicker: Hanny's is said to be haunted (this according to the waitstaff).   I'm curious if/when you visit, you check out the bathrooms on the top floor.  The set up is kind of creepy and reminded me of a scene out of  ""The Shining""...

Hanny's has a history. It use to be one of the original department stores in Phoenix. After it closed, the fire department used it for training drills.  You can still see the scorched walls in the elevator shaft.

With all this charm, I might consider overlooking the overpriced drinks. I ordered a martini, which came out in a tiny glass (maybe 4-5 oz ). The charge was $7.50,  I jokingly asked our server  if Hanny's put the ""teenie"" in ""Martini""?  I thought it was funny, but the waiter didn't. 

Moreover, I was left disappointed with the menu selection. It seemed dull and limited. But, as the waiter explained, Hanny's was developed as a wine bar and the limited menu was intentional. I just think with the great location and status, this place has so much more potential! 

For an appetizer we ordered the Bruchetta -- which is mostly olives (as oppose to traditional tomato bruchetta). For dinner, I ordered the veggie pizza - which seemed flavorless.   They had two actual dinner specials which change daily/weekly and my husband seemed content and satisfied with his ""special.""

Wild Wing is located in a small, but expanding plaza with a variety of restaurants, including Aji Sai, Korean shabu shabu, Phoenix Restaurant and even a Dollarama. Choices, choices, choices.

But for that night, I was craving wings.

There was 1 hostess managing the restaurant on a Saturday night, but there was only 2-3 tables filled. 

Ordered:
Honey Garlic and BBQ - I've tried the Honey Garlic wings here before. It tasted EXACTLY the same. The sweetness covers up any hint of BBQ flavour it may hope to show. I didn't mind as much, as I do love my honey garlic wings, but disappointing, as they do have an extensive list on the honey garlic combinations, probably with the same result.

Gar-Par - A combination of garlic and parmesan. A bit too creamy for my liking. 

Overall, the wings are well cooked, meaty, and juicy. Too many wing places over cook their wings to dryness, so Wild Wings does this well. The flavours were a bit disappointing though. 

Oh, and the fries. McCain fries anyone?

This place doesn't blow my mind, but great for a quick fix.

I liked the concept of the restaurant- you could order meatballs (3 large balls, you pick the meat and sauce), for $7.99.  You could also get sandwiches, salads, or pizza. They also had shakes and varieties of ice cream sandwiches. 

I ordered the chicken meatballs with the spicy meat sauce, and my friend got the turkey meatballs and the parmesan cream sauce. I liked her sauce better, but my balls better (ok, every time I type ""balls"", I can't help but chuckle...yes, I'm secretly 12).

I forgive you! Like my sister who told a secret to someone that I didn't want that person to know and she starts crying and apologizing profusely once I tell her how upset I was. She states that she didn't know that it would upset me so - I had to forgive her and move on. It was a genuine apology and I still love her.... Yes, that's how I feel with Thai E-San. 

They messed up, but they didn't know until I posted that review. The owner reached out to me and invited me to the restaurant on her. She told me she researched what was wrong with the noodles and it's because the manufacturer of the noodles changed the texture/ingredients so when you cook it, it turns into mush. She had to change the way they cooked the noodle dish to make it back to the greatness I remember it being. She also discussed the service and she has made changes to improve. 

She apologized and thanked me for posting the review. She said that she deals with negative reviews seriously and she takes it as constructive criticism to improve. Bravo, Pui (the owner)! Now, that's a great restaurant owner!

We came the other night and we were served the two dishes we always get: Shrimp Pad Se-Ew and Beef Panang - both were deliciously fabulous! The service was great and the owner was so sweet and hopes that we come back.

Second note: I guess the quality makes up for it

We came in the evening on a weekend and the first thing I noticed was the place is huge. They have multiple TVs around and even a large screen in the back where you can watch the game even from the other side. 
For the beer lovers they have quite an extensive beer menu! 

The server informed us there was a few items that weren't available on the menu which were the Raw Bar, Lobster nachos and crawfish (not in season). We were slightly disappointed there was no lobster nachos as we wanted to give it a try. 

We ordered fries (came out hot and fresh), oyster sliders (comes in 3), lobster bisque (was rich and creamy), lobster roll (hot), and 2 lbs of shrimp (cajun-med, and house blend-med)

Everything was yummy and we enjoyed everything! The food was all in excellent quality and fresh. The lobster roll was amazing as the bread was soft, and the lobster was meaty, fresh and buttery. It comes with salad, fries and coleslaw (hence the price point). The portion for the roll was on the smaller side but since it is seafood, I feel it's quite reasonable.
We noticed the shrimps are larger/meatier than other boil houses. We also prefer the house blend more than the cajun because it adds a garlicky taste that the cajun blend lacks.

Great service - the server came around often to check up on us, cleared our plates and refilled our water.

So, I ordered the mini unagi don and was pleased to find that the eel didn't have that gross taste you get when the eel is not prepared right. However, I did find that the eel was a bit on the cold side, probably because it was also meant to be used to make sushi. I was also happy with the portioning, because I was concerned that I wouldn't be full with a ""mini"" don. When I got my order though, I saw that the word 'mini' is debatable in describing the dish since I was more than full when I finished it (keep in mind though that I ate this for lunch, when my appetite is substantially smaller). In addition service was quite excellent, as if I was in an actual restaurant! Overall, it's not fair to judge this place from a restaurant stand point b/c at the end of the day it's more like a cross over b/w food court and fast food restaurant. With that in mind then my high score is more justifiable.

My wife and I stopped for lunch at M&S today after business on the South Side.  Relatively empty, even at 12.00n.  

The server was pleasant and attentive enough. I appreciated his solid service.

I ordered a caesar salad and the fish and chips.  My wife ordered a mixed green salad and the trout.  The romaine lettuce is my salad was turning brown at the edges and I found only TWO croutons, neither of which had any garlic flavor (though promised on the menu. Clearly the lettuce was days old.  My wife's salad has several rotten (not just brown but rotten) pieces of greens.  How hard (and expensive) is it to serve FRESH salads?  The fries (chips) on my plate were cold, even though they were UNDER the fish.  I had barely a tablespoon of tartar sauce for the healthy portion of fish that I was served.  The fish was good.  I also received a small (half-cup or so) of cole slaw that was one step from frozen.  Like the salads, obviously days old.  Nothing on my wife's plate, not the trout, the green beans or the pasta, was seasoned at all. Very bland and tasteless.  

VERY disappointing.  And I suspect that the server knew this because when he cleared the entrees he asked ""Can I get you anything else?"" and NOT ""How was lunch?""  

Not that I'm cheap, but my wife turned back the salad without eating but a bite-full yet the waiter made no effort to take it off the bill.

This is traditionally considered Hong Kong style comfort food. The Hong Kong diner food is mostly concentrated on the little yellow menu, so that's where I order from most of the time.

As I said, it's comfort food, and I feel very comforted whenever I go. It's nothing like the Americanized Chinese food I grew up with. They serve a few things most Americans probably won't eat--like crispy fried pork intestine, which I still have not developed the courage to try--but on the whole it's just a much more authentic, fresh, and non-artificial tasting Chinese food experience. 

It seems like everything is amazing, but I particularly love the rice porridge (with Chinese donuts), the ningo, and the pan fried noodles. 

Oh... and the turnip cakes.

Oh, don't forget the pot stickers.

and the rice rolls. Oh my gosh, I could go on and on.

What's funny is that they have a couple of servers who don't speak any English or Cantonese (only Mandarin) so even though I'm there with a bunch of Chinese people they're still using sign-language to communicate with the waiter. 

One more thing. It helps if you know that friendly service is not really a Chinese concept. It's more like, we give you food, you give us money, then you leave. I like the matter-of-fact and honest nature of that transaction. That said, I think the service is pretty decent, they get the food out quickly most of the time. We waited a long time once, but that never happened again.

Well you should have been there the night I was a VIP because the staff was letting anyone wander into our area. 

The VIP experience - bottle service - is really just bottle without any service. 

The night started with the valet and police yelling at our Uber. Once inside, initially we were given directions on where to go instead of being escorted upstairs. Once upstairs, we were shown to our VIP area and after orders were taken and the tray of mixers and glasses and bottles delivered, nothing else happened. No one opened the bottles for us. No one poured drinks for us. They dropped the tray off and left only to reappear to see if we needed new bottles. There were only 6 of us, the effort to provide some actual service would have been minimal. In between that, in the absence of any security or bouncer figure, random people kept coming into the VIP area and sitting on the couches and taking pictures against the city backdrop. And to top it all off on the way out the valet managed to yell at our Uber again! 

The view is nice, but that is about all this place has going for it. There are many places in Cleveland that provide better service and that are classier atmospheres. People here were let in wearing anything from gym shoes and cargo shorts to suits. The management here needs to hire a consultant to help them figure their act out.

I found the sushi a bit bland, I used a lot of soy sauce and wasabi. The only thing good about it was that the servings were pretty massive. I had to split into two meals.

My check-in was smooth and very professional, with very little wait. So far, so good. But finding your room the first time may be a challenge. I've stayed at LOTS of hotels, with all manner of layouts, but even I was bamboozled by the hallways and following too many signs to find my room number. If you're planning on a few cocktails, you may need to leave breadcrumbs to find your way back. If you ever find your room, you'll come into a sleek, modern space with a nice roomy feel. Soft beiges on the furniture are nicely contrasted by an eggplant carpet with three cream accent stripes. There are 16,296 buttons in the room and you probably won't have time to figure out what they all do, but the sheer and drape controls worked great and the curtains black things out nicely. The bathroom is large and has a ""wet area"", with the shower and then tub beyond set behind their own glass door. (FYI, the glass door is clear, so there's no privacy since anyone at the vanity can see any doodles or hoohahs in the wet area. But hey, if you're sharing a hotel room in Vegas with someone chances are they've already seen you naked. Thankfully the door to the WC is frosted.) The toiletries are boring.

The restaurant collection is tops, one of the very best in Vegas. Standouts are Julian Serrano, Sage, Bar Masa, and American Fish. Jean-Georges Steakhouse is decent but pales next to the chef's own Prime at Bellagio. Casual restaurants are also high-quality. The restaurants all have high-concept design and are all successful, which makes it puzzling as to why the lobby area, the casino, and the spa are all so boring in their design. Some people may see this as an antidote to the Vegas craziness, but when I'm in Sin City, I want all crazy all the time.

My spa treatment made up for the beigeness of the space by being absolute fantastic and restful, with larger-than-average rooms. It was pointy-nipple cold, so I didn't check out the pool. Overall, it's a high quality place with location, restaurants, room size, and well-trained staff giving it lots of plus points.",2013-01-29 20:19:34

Sometimes I have too, but East side Vietnamese food (albeit somewhat Americanized) is rare and makes a nice change. There are vegetarian options, and for good prices ($11-$12 for a decent portion). BUT: The items on the extensive vegetarian menu are NOT all vegetarian. Good luck figuring out which ones are: I got a lot of lies and dismissals and contradictory answers from different people (wait staff and by phone) simply because they didn't want to go back to the kitchen and ask which ones have no fish sauce--or because even in the kitchen, they have no idea.

SERVICE

After multiple visits over six months or so, I can say it has been consistently friendly, but consistently poor: inefficient, and many mistakes. So many wrong dishes, my guests eventually gave up and just ate the mistakes.

 But the WORST thing--unforgivable in food service--is the lack of knowledge about their own dishes, and complete lack of interest in finding out the answers. Aside from vegetarians, we had people with food allergies. That's serious business! Again and again our server thought ""I don't know"" and ""probably"" were sufficient answers. Her smile faltered when pressed for real info--she didn't want to be bothered. (How could these questions not come up every single day? Do most people accept ""maybe"" as an answer about ingredients?)

In the end I was told, regarding some ""vegetarian"" dishes: ""just don't eat the sauce, it's on the side."" As though a) I should have known psychically that this particular ""vegetarian"" dish had a meat-based sauce AND that it came on the side, and as though b) being charged full price for a sauceless, flavorless meal mis-labeled vegetarian on the menu is an acceptable alternative I should be lucky to get. I didn't get one of those dishes, needless to say.

If you're not going to cater to vegetarians, then don't pretend to. The same concern applies to any questions about the food. Stay away if you have any intolerances or disliking for certain ingredients.

ATMOSPHERE

Nice inside (modern) but quite brightly lit, and the 4 sports TVs behind the bar are out of place and distracting (but thankfully silent). The place is maybe half full at the dinner hour on weekend, and cleared out almost completely after that, so if you don't want crowds and bustle, it's worth a look.

FOOD

Average quality, acceptable for the price. But some dishes are TOTALLY different from the menu.

ALWAYS ask whether a dish is exactly like the menu describes, or something else. Example--the Pineapple Chicken:

I came with a diabetic who specifically did not want her meat breaded in carbs. Some dishes specify breading; some--like the Pineapple Chicken--don't, so she ordered that. It was explicitly stated in the menu as chicken served in a half-pineapple. Sounds fun, right? And she loves pineapple. Well, what arrived was very ordinary Chinese takeout, except for lemon in the sauce which was good and unusual. It was breaded, and it was NOT served in a pineapple; in fact it had just a couple tiny pieces of what might have been canned pineapple. Totally false advertising. She ate it anyway because she has to eat on a schedule--and got sick from it while not even enjoying it.

Other guests have commented on a bad smell in the food. Ok, I'll just say it: they agreed that onecertain dish smelled like baby poop. (But tasted OK. Then again, maybe baby poop tastes OK. I cannot opine.) The seafood tends to be worse than other dishes, I'm told.

I'll go back myself--occasionally--but I will never take guests again! I have been burned every time.",2013-09-08 19:40:39

I'd never heard of such a thing and was skeptical about how good a $5 steak would be. I also don't like eating late at night but he told me I'd regret it if I didn't.

I was starving by the time he got back since I stayed up waiting for him to return. My take-out box had steak, eggs, hashbrowns, and toast. The steak, to be honest, was barely edible and had a ton of fat. Another friend, who was also starving, thought it was delicious and ate most of it. The eggs were scrambled, pretty bland, and could've used some salt. So... why 4 stars?

The Loaded Hashbrowns -- it's $1 more to get them loaded, but do it anyway (uh, it's only a $1). I can promise you you won't regret it, because it's the most delightfully delicious concoction of hashbrowns, gravy, cheese, and only God knows what else (crack?); especially when you're starving at 4 AM. I'd pay $5.99 just for these hashbrowns alone.

First things first - I am not a sports fan, and I consider Toronto Sports Team to be well more or less lacklustre in performance in general. There are such high expectations for the Jays this year - that I am still of the opinion that any Toronto based sports team aims to aim high only to disappoint at the very end.

However, negative feelings aside - Canada Day ball at the ball park is an awesome time out - even if SO's parents and 1/2 of your parents are meeting for the first time, since all the pressure is on the home team to bring home the win - which they did quite handily I might say. 

Atmosphere - Festive - Canada Day - so it was almost a carnival like atmosphere before game time - the freebie of the day was a red Jay replica hat - but there were others like t-shirts and when you left the game - a free gas card. However you need to get there and leave there early - since they do run out of the giveaway stuff rather quickly.

Once you enter in the gates - there are no IN and Out privileges so make sure you do all your outside the gate exploring first before heading on in.

Beer vendors and snack vendors galore - they come up and down the aisles pretty much until the end of the 7th inning stretch - which is pretty much when they stop serving beer to you seat-side and once the sun comes out - it's ice cream vendors too. The food is pretty much what you expect at the park, which is more or less pricey for what you are getting. 

The game - pretty much was fast paced from the get-go and the crowd gets into it pretty quickly, when the home team does something unexpectedly good. Two bases stolen and the crowd is on their feet screaming and cheering, and hopping up and down. 

Seems the best seats are around the outfield or just behind home plate the catch those foul balls..

Taking a date out the ballgame or even the parents and in-laws out to the ballgame - because they'll have something to talk about and it won't be you.

They have a great selection of outdoor gear here. Sure, in some cases the prices may shock you, but you pay for quality and when you're out in the middle of nowhere relying on your gear to keep you warm and safe, you'll be happy that you paid a little extra for the good stuff! They do have less expensive alternatives as well.

Aside from the selection, the one thing that I really appreciate at REI, especially at this location, is their staff. I have always found them to be friendly and knowledgeable. They know the gear and they know what you'll need for your trip, because they've used the gear on all of their own trips.

One great fact is that they offer tons of lovely vegetarian options, which means that you can bring a mixed group of omnivores and veggie people and still keep everyone happy.  Also, I feel like overall the dining experience is that of a slightly higher priced restaurant, which is always a nice surprise.

I know that they have a beautiful varied menu with lots of great choices, but I am cursed with being so in love with one particular dish at the moment that I can't manage to branch out to something different.  Even though there are so many other tempting items on the menu.  Maybe next time?

I tend to go to Utopia in the afternoon, generally a brunchy weekend visit.  I'll usually get a coffee to start and then order the Chicken Club.  I know that sounds so incredibly boring, but honestly it's delicious.  It comes on a slim, tender french stick baguette, chopped into three decent sized portions.   The sandwich comes topped with swiss cheese, deliciously seasoned grilled chicken, bacon, red pepper mayo, salad greens, tomatoes and red onions.  And on the side, some of Utopia's golden crispy perfect fries.  I will usually get a side of the green onion or garlic dill mayo for the fries, and maybe a glass of white wine (because nothing goes better with fries than white wine, lol).  

For the rest of the menu I can only plead ignorance, other than to say my friend ALWAYS gets the veggie chicken burrito and I have tried it and can say that, yes, it is tasty and wow does that veggie chicken taste good!  

The staff are also great, casual but very professional and good at checking in on you.  They're happy to make recommendations too.  In the summer, there's a really nice back patio.  Overall the place is a bit too tiny, but that's part of the coziness and charm of the place - except when you get there at the wrong time and have to wait for a table.

Still, yelpers recommend it and we thought we'd take a break from Pho Phuong and try a new place.  It helps that it's equidistant from our house.

Ambience is low key, very quiet, no multi-TV distraction (YAY!!!), and clean, though the menus were a bit skuzzy.  I blame the youth of today.

As we were sitting down, another couple arrived to a chance meeting with apparent acquaintances who had been enjoying a meal:  ""You've got good taste in restaurants!"" they remarked to their friends.  ""This is the place for Pho in TO.""  How's that for a first impression upon arriving? 

Anyway!

I ordered the S3 and #13, with a bean shake to wash it down.  The server informed that, due to Monday being a holiday (Easter weekend), S3 was unavailable -- he seemed somewhat chagrined, as though he was offending me.  No worries!  I got the Hue style beef pho instead, which is their weekend offering.

Heather went for the ol' standby of noodles, grilled pork, and spring roll with salad (nice greens, no crappy/wilty iceberg lettuce!) and her customary avocado milkshake.

The soup was very good, tasty though not extraordinary, and came with nice, thick rice noodles rather than the vermicelli style one normally sees -- this pleased me greatly!  I definitely prefer a more robust noodle, so they score points here.  The side of sprouts, basil, limi, and a chili was very generous... which is good, because I usually have to ask for more.

The banh cuon (I think that's the name) isn't normally my style, but it was good.  The odd little muffin thing topped with a fried shimp was damned tasty (I didn't bother with the shrimp... it was desiccated, though had served its purpose by imparting mucho flavour).  

I have come to realize, however, that I'm just not a fan of Vietnamese style sausage... at least not the spongy, starchy kind served here (and many other places).  They taste good, sure, but it just ain't meat.  I'd feel the same way if I was served a hotdog on the side.

Heather remarked that her dinner was excellent, though she prefers the crispy spring rolls at Pho Phuong -- not because Pho Linh's are somehow lesser, oh no!  Linh's are huge, and crammed with meat.  So if you prefer a meaty roll, definitely try them out here... you won't be disappointed.     

Shakes were both excellent, though they were served in plastic takeout cups when we were sitting down to eat (and it was pouring rain outside...).  Weird.  Ah well -- we'll ask for glass next time.

Finally, I've noticed a few people have questioned the service here.  We found it very fast, friendly, and good.  Absolutely no complaints there whatsoever.  Maybe it falters when it's busy... but it was A-OK this time around!

All in all we were quite pleased with our experience -- I tried a couple things I wouldn't normally order, so won't pass judgement based on the things I didn't care for (the sausage, for example).  We'll definitely be back, in particular because I want to try their basic chicken pho.  If they roast their chicken and the broth is good I'll consider switching my go-to Pho joint!

The chicken is big(ger than my face), and feels satisfyingly filling. But at $10, it doesn't feel like a complete meal (what about some veggies? Carbs?). Was hungry a few hours later.

Service is friendly but a little slow. Seems like they fry the chicken fresh from raw with each order. It tastes piping hot at least, so it's worth it.

The other drawback was a poor design of the cafe. Aparantly they don't have a back service entry door for deliveries. That means that the daily (because they use fresh ingredients) come through the same small door which customers are using . Awkward to hold up foot traffic for a pallet jack full of deliveries.

I always felt like I would either get raped or shivved if I strolled in here. I told this to the bartender, who laughed and said ""Well that is a possibility"". So, being a pasty white boy, how could I possibly have fallen in love with The Duce when death is so certain? Well, its because this place is like a loving pit bull: Looks are deceiving!

~What to Do?~
You can drink....because it's a bar. You can enjoy a variety of eats and treats, if they have them. You can sing karaoke, if drunk enough...and you can entertain your large group of friends, if you have enough of them. Besides the wide open space in the main area near the bar, they also have Corn Hole and Ping Pong (or as they say in China: Ping Pang) tables ready to go!

~The Good~
Service is great. The bartender was relaxed and quickly made me a drink after I looked at him bemused by the mason jars and high-end liquors. All the liquor is high-end (blow me, Baccardi) and just adds to the utter ironic nature of this place. A big shed, slinging high quality cocktails in mason jars? Like Marv Albert would say: ""Yessssssss!!!!"" They also offer old-school beers which like dinosaurs I thought were buried long long ago... So long that most of us never would think would be offered at this point. So wrong! You can find them here! It's just different at the Duce. The drink menu is huge, and the drinks are as well. Prices are a bit steep, but these are top shelf liquors we are drinking and the sizes are huge. Do the division, the price is right! Food looks serviceable, it's a give and take menu filled with fun items that will fill most gullets. I am on a diiiet, as in, I die inside when I look at the items on the menu. Looks yummy, I must say. Dessert is off the chain, from regular pies and shakes to spiked floats and shakes as well!! 

Plus, the atmosphere is so chill....so chill. Ping pong and Corn hole in the middle room is an awesome touch, as is the random boxing ring, which I imagine numerous drunks crawl on. Karaoke on Thursday (when we went) was totally fun, even when only 15 people were in the joint. The staff all know how and when to buddy up and talk to their patrons, and make the place even more inviting.

~The Bad~
So the desserts were pretty much all out. I was going to get Laura I. a surprise pie in a cup, and they were all out...lame. That's about the extent of the issues I had with the food itself. As for the venue, it's a tad dingy outside and inside (I mean, come on). I still am not sure about hitting this place up all by myself on a raging Saturday night.. Really though, this place has few flaws and sets itself apart because it rolls to its own beat.

~The Low Down~
There is so much space here! You can take huge groups and bring them for a good time. Whether its karaoke or just because, if you live in Downtown/Central Phoenix, The Duce is an awesome and ironic spot to grab a drink (or 10). I am yearning to go back and fight my fear of being shot. I am curious. Maybe that's why my friends call me whiskers. Because I am curious like a...

This specific Ten Ren location is great for groups! Especially if you like hanging out late like I do (mind you it gets a bit crowded on weekend nights). It's a pretty big place, with outdoor seating as well and the place just looks like it's really meant for groups.

The food is Taiwanese snacks and the such, which isn't too bad, but it's not exactly something to shout from the roof tops. My go to meal is the chicken bowl, I think there might be a name for it, but I can't seem to remember. It's steamed rice in a bowl of tea broth and popcorn chicken, it's so so so good! 

The bubble tea is disappointing, ironically. It's a lot better in their retail stores.

For the second time, this is some of the worst service I've had.  I tried to order the Kalbi with Buckwheat noodles. the server barked ""NO!"". Um... okay.... I had to ask her why and after asking if they were out of the Kalbi. She said Yes. Fine... I'll order something else with buckwheat noodles. ""NO"". Okay, so are you out of ribs, or buckwheat noodles? She didn't know. I asked if I could have the ribs with Chapchae noodle instead of the buckwheat and pay extra. ""NO"". 

I was getting really exhausted. I realize that there is a language barrier. But it's really frustrating to be told ""NO"" so boldly and so many times. When I tried to order the Mixed veggie stone bowl she told me ""NO"". I was like... You're out of VEGGIES?? and she said it was only the bowl. I had no idea what she meant by this but I was so frustrated I just picked something random and hoped she'd say yes.

I still have no idea what I ate.

When we asked for water, she reluctantly brought it, but with no glasses. So we just drank the rest of our tea and poured the water in the tea glasses.

I know a lot of people like this place, but I think it's pretty bad. I've given it a second chance and I don't see any reason to return. I can understand that I don't speak Korean and English was not our server's first language, but that is no reason that we can't communicate. Also, being a server, myself, I am not a pain in the ass or high maintenance customer. I mean, HECK... I ordered something completely random just to end the painful ordering process.

I ordered a bag of shrimps with the house sauce, and a lobster roll meal for $22! The lobster roll was pretty amazing and it had just the right amount of butter, everything was covdered.

As appetizers, the goyza is a nice touch, as well as the kimchi fried rice. I love how you can see into the kitchen from the dining area.

No, I don't mind at all if you want to melt all over my tongue, slide down my windpipe and settle satisfyingly into the safety of my stomach. Yes, that's right. It's a safe place for you down there. Why? Because you will be integrated into a most noble cause... fueling me and my love of ice cream.

Me and good ice cream go way back. I'm talking long days sitting together in the Millet Ice Cream Parlour. I'd dig in for a scoop of Moose Tracks for an eager customer... and scoop around the magic cluster of mini peanut butter cups if I found any (now you know my secret. Don't ever let me scoop you ice cream). If I opened the shop, it would be ice cream for breakfast and lunch. If I was closing it down, ice cream for lunch and dinner. We had a great relationship, quality ice cream and I. 

It's been a long time since I've had ice cream like that nearby. And now, it's right up the stairs from me whenever I'm headed down to Caffe Rosso on 11th ave. I didn't know it was so close until Friday night when, like a bold teenager who's decided she cannot endure her crush much longer, I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands and that me and this ice cream meet. 

I didn't stop at just a simple introduction. Oh no... I went all the way to third base. It was a Friday night after all (Village is open until 11pm on the weekend... 10pm the rest of the week). A scoop of vanilla bean, followed up with a scoop of huckleberry and topped off with the infamous salted caramel. *drool* That's some quality cream.

Village, you sure do know your way to a Yelper's heart. You and I are going to become friends, close, intimate friends. The kind where people question our intentions (or at least mine). But I don't care. Now that I know you're here, I must have you.",2013-01-29 06:07:58

Dr Newman was my gynecologist for 3 years, and I never really wanted to get pregnant. I will be forever grateful that he was my doctor when I did unexpectedly (but happily.) I was an Advanced Maternal Age expectant mom whose husband had just moved to a new state for a new job 9 days before I found out I was pregnant. Just a tad bit of anxiety... Dr. Newman was awesome - easing my fears, counseling me on prenatal testing, telling me no more than I wanted to know, and constantly making me laugh. 

My delivery had some complications, and I was in tears in the delivery room. When Dr. Newman walked in, I breathed a sigh of relief. As much as he jokes, he's all business when it comes down to delivery. He visited me twice after birth and as I struggled with breastfeeding (tongue tied baby), he was incredibly encouraging and again, made me laugh when I was on the verge of tears. 

After an emotionally difficult pregnancy and scary (for me) delivery, I'm so grateful to have had the perfect doctor for me. His dry humor might not be for everyone, but I give as good as I get... Either way, he's the doctor you want in your delivery room - competent, knowledgeable, and committed to bringing your baby safely into the world.",2015-04-30 03:03:21

Mind you, the Bellagio conservatory was closed so we were slightly disappointed however, getting seated by the window with a lovely view of the pool quickly got our mind off of it.
Our server, Jaime was great! He was very friendly and made jokes with us throughout the whole evening. He had great recommendations that really sold us as well.

We were started off with some bread. You have the option of sour dough or honey wheat. (Hint: make sure to save bread for later if you're going to be ordering the Pot Pie. Dipping bread into the sauce leaves some type of magic in your mouth)

What we ordered:
Hamachi Crudo: (what's in it- avocado, yuzu koshu, pickled kohlrabi)
It was OoOoookay. It was good but nothing special.

Ahi Tuna Tartare: (what's in it- ancho sesame oil, pine nuts, mint)
Smells and tastes so good! The runner will be finishing up the preparation of the dish at your table. You will be able to watch him/her crack the egg on to the tuna and mix it with the rest of the condiments. 

Maine Lobster Pot Pie: (what's in it- baby vegetables, truffle-lobster cream)
Like the Ahi Tuna Tartare, the server or runner will be plating the dish by your table. They will bring the pot by you and explain the dish  while they move the components of the dish on to your plate. The highlights of the pot pie are definitely the pie crust and the lobster. The lobster was great as expected, it tasted fresh and was very tender. I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the crust! Even when it was drenched in the sauce, it still had a crunch to it!

Root Beer Float: (what's in it- sassafras ice cream, warm chocolate chip pecan cookies)
Yes, I am that person that orders a root beer float at a fine dining restaurant AND I have no regrets. The ice cream easily melted with my root beer and was so delicious. The chocolate chips in the cookies were just oozing out of the cookies and the cookie itself was so chewy. Perfect way to end the meal.

I 1st happened upon Joes by attending a private party and got to met the owner Bob, and Chef Michael, both gave a little history of the place, it used to be a drive thru liquor store back in the day, found that kind of neat and the kitchen does not cook with a range or stove, everything is cooked in a wood fire oven giving the dishes a flamed kissed flavor! That's pretty cool!

At this event I was able to try the Moroccan spiced chicken skewers with cous cous with a mango yogurt dip which was completely delish! Can't wait to try that again! I also tried other items which after I went home made me want to come back quickly to Joe's to get more!

On my second trip I tried some curried cauliflower, the Notorious BIG Burger and the Tart Tatin (which was calling me by my name saying come back to Joes, you need me!!)

The curried cauliflower was seasoned and cooked perfectly and came with green currants, shallots and almonds, it's a great dish to share or devour by yourself! 

the Notorious BIG Burger is a show stopper! It's beef, braised pork, coleslaw, cheeses and pork rinds on a delish bun and served with fries. This burger is amazing! So dang good and full of flavor! And the fries come with ketchup and a curry ketchup, and this curry ketchup takes your fries to another level of delish! The flavors!! So good!

Whole stuffed chicken with sticky rich ($42)
This was a very impressive dish. I've never had anything like this before. It was not a disappointment at all. The skin was nice and crispy, the sticky rice was perfectly cooked and the portion was enough for about 5-6 people. I didn't taste it at the time but as leftover, it was quite oily.

Deep fried oysters ($16.95)
There were eight pieces and they were all quite big. I thought it was nicely seasoned and breaded just right. If you're craving oysters, I would recommend this dish but it's not a must try.

Pork belly with preserved vegetable ($10)
I believe one of the reviews described this dish as ""melt in your mouth"" so I had to see if it was really that good ... and it was! It definitely does melt in your mouth because it's so sliced thinner than other restaurant. The preserved vegetables that's normally very salty was actually not that bad. This is a must get dish if you're a lover of pork belly!

Green beans ($7.95) and green bean sprouts with king oyster mushrooms ($18.95)
These two dishes were average except the price of the second veggie dish. They both tasted good but $20 for a dish of vegetable is quite steep!

There was also complimentary soup and dessert which was nice.

It was recommended by many people to make reservations before coming so we did. We were actually seated earlier than our reservation time (7:27)!

However, it doesn't bother me, and I did love the meat pizza and the spinach one.  Which one was best would be like Sophie's Choice for me as I loved them both.
This location is very pretty compared to the other, but both are good.  I like Spinato's myself.  Good service, decent pizza.
AND the server even asked us what type of crust we liked, so you can get thick crust or thin or medium--whatever--which I never had before.  
We had a Black guy who said he was an ex-Marine, but I didn't catch his name (Brandon? Bradley?), but he was excellent so the group tipped super well to him.

Definitely agree with other reviewers sentiments that for the price, the food is average at best. Quite frankly, the menu seems a bit uninspired and way overpriced. Even after dining off the Winterlicious menu, I didn't feel that the 3-course meal warranted a $45 price tag. 

I had the arugula, goat cheese + beet salad to start, gnocchi as my main, and white chocolate cranberry cheesecake for dessert. Everything seemed a bit underseasoned and nothing particularly stood out -- the gnocchi in particular were huge, gummy, and bland. Dessert was the highlight of the meal; my cheesecake was good (but not great), and I had a taste of my boyfriend's lavender crème brulée which was quite nice. Everything was presented beautifully, but seemed to lack substance, which unfortunately seems to be the theme at Boehmer.

On a positive note, the cocktails we had were delicious ($14), and I love the big open kitchen and the atmosphere of the restaurant. Our server was attentive and obviously experienced -- water was always topped up, we were checked on after being served each course, etc. The beautiful and spacious interior would make Boehmer ideal for group functions, I assume. The tables are spaced out nicely so that you don't have to literally rub elbows with diners beside you, which is a plus. 

I would come back for drinks + dessert, but for a great meal, I would definitely go elsewhere. Good looks are nice, but good food is way more important.",2013-02-02 17:19:21

First of all it is TINY just off broadview and Queen I believe across from good old Jilly's to set the tone for atmosphere, the parking is on the street or paid in a fairly dark and dingy lot located just behind the restaurant. Inside the seats are basically car seats I believe with tables and a clutter of postings, news clippings and random paraphenalia like a cow skull I believe I remember seeing adorning the walls and strewn about the place. The surroundings were all extremely dirty, prob the worst I have seen in a while with a sticky, film or residue to almost anything you touch then again most of the things you really don't need to touch and given the atmosphere of the place itself it is strangely acceptable.

The service I will say I found to be atrocious, I don't care if you've had ""bad"" experiences with customers in the past, regardless of the area your in which by the way you must have had some say in as you've opened a business there!!.. Regardless of all these things this is a customer service oriented industry and they need to consider that, being rude to every customer because some are cheap, bad or rude is ridiculous!!! Paying before you get your food is a little strange though I do realize why they do it, however what happens if your not satisfied with the food you get? Whatever, obviously this is geared to be more of a sit in fast food style restaurant but then you have to go up and order yourself... the only thing resembling a restaraunt is some miserable looking man will bring your order to you.

The food is the only thing that sets this place apart and i will agree with previous comments stating that the burgers are excellent but the sides can be iffy. The burgers here are one of a kind though... they offer things like; ""The Elvis""  - Bacon, Peanut Butter and Fried Banana, ""The Big Kahuna"" - Pineapple Slice, Peameal Bacon, and Mozzarella.  Served with Mayonnaise, Lettuce and Tomato or how about the ""The Big Kevorkian"" - Fried onion, fried mushrooms, 2 slices fried bacon, deep fried pickle, garlic dressing and mayo! Crazy big portions as well give it a little more bang for your buck and I find the prices very competitive to begin with.

On the past 6 occasions that I've had the misfortune of flying SouthWest from PHX, I have been on average 45 minutes delayed. The worst of which was last Thursday when I was delayed over two hours. 

Southwest, your hub is in Phoenix. When one of your planes is on the fritz, just bring in one of the several you stash here. My time is money, and when you're late, I am losing money. Or in the instance of last week, I am losing vacation time, which to me is even more valuable as I don't get much of it.

The consistent inconsistency is one thing, but when its married to the people who I now habitually encounter on your flights, its getting to be too damn much of a pain in my ass to fly your ""discount airline.""

Last week is a pretty good example. Mind you, Southwest can't control who purchases seats on their flights, but the flight attendants, who seem to be so overtly fond of banning people for dress or political commentary, really don't do jack shit in the air.

There was a child and his mother behind me on the flight. Little bastard wouldn't calm down, wouldn't stop screaming about ""Oh, I can see grandpa's house"" from 35,000' in the air, wouldn't stop kicking the seat. All his useless womb of a mother could do was ""Oh jeffy, calm down, give mommy a kiss."" Mind you, if I had been wearing one of my objectionable t-shirts they wouldn't have let me on the plane, but even after SEVERAL passenger complaints to the lady and to the flight attendant the attendants absolutely refused to do anything or to speak to the mother.

Three hours of that shit is just too much, sorry.

Southwest really has become the ""Greyhound of the Sky"" in the last year or so. I have one more flight booked with them this year so far, and if I have a hand in my travel, it will be the last time I fly on this two bit trash festival in the stratosphere.",2012-09-13 20:02:59

The line started before 7am. Today it opened at 8am. They started handing out little cups of their signature coffee. My favorite. 

For the grand opening gift, we got a bag, toasted baguettes, a reusable cup, and pour over coffee. Sweet. 

There is a drive-thru. 

Their Vietnamese sandwiches are cheaper than the European sandwiches. For example, the #6 BBQ pork baguette is $4.39. I get extra meat for an additional $1. The #32 turkey and cheese croissant is $6.99. The breakfast sandwiches are cheaper. The #87, a ham, bacon, egg & cheese croissant is $3.99. Their baguettes are great. I like them better than their croissants, but the croissants are still delicious. 

Also, there are vegetarian options. 

I never leave here without getting the pork and shrimp egg rolls. They are $4.29 for 5. Or it's $15.99 for 20. 

The hot wings are 5 for $2.99. I never got them before but I bought them today. They are crispy on the outside, but a little on the salty side. However, it's good.

They have macarons, with different box sizes. I bought the 6 pack for $8.99

They do have a bunch of Asian snacks and bottled beverages as well for purchase. I'm definitely coming back.  

*update. Their drive thru was broken apparently. They didn't have any signs and I couldn't just drive through it, because they had a truck parked on the other side. Backing out of a drive thru sucks.

Sadly, my tolerance for Kierland dictates when and how often I visit North but I really am a fan of this restaurant.  

Good selection of tasty appetizers, the burrata is an interesting and delicious selection, bruschetta is a solid choice, fonduta is my absolute favorite with smoky cheese and buttery slices of grilled bread, skip the meat/cheese board - it wasn't bad but I've had better.

I've tried the beet and the seasonal vegetable salads, both were excellent but I'm a beet fan and I thoroughly enjoyed theirs.

The pizza is delicious, Margherita and Fig + Prosciutto are my favorites and they have some interesting pizza specials, I tried one with butternut squash and it was out of this world.  Pasta is made fresh in house which is really a delight, the gnocchi with short rib and horseradish cream is as outrageous as it sounds.

Dark chocolate tart, olive oil cake and caramel budino are all delicious, I'd say the tart is my favorite because of the cookie-like crust and toffee pieces.

Their pizza is thin and light, so you won't feel the ""ball of grease"" effect that you can get after richer pizza.  On the downside, they're also a little light with the sauce and cheese, as the crust cannot take as much as a pan or Sicilian crust.

The flatbread sandwiches are decent and good for lunch or a lighter meal.  The turkey, salami/ham, and meatball are all a step above Paradise Bakery's glorified ""cracker"" flatbread and Subway's lackluster options.  I'm not a big fan of the pasta, but my family likes it.  The lasagna wasn't spectacular, but was a solid 3.5/5.

The potato chips used to have a lovely Parmesan garlic garnish, which was eliminated.  Now they just grab chips from what looked like the same Sea Salt flavor of Cape Cod chips Costco sells.  I've also had them forget to pack my chips once.

I did not care for the Nutella trifle (not a fan of the slippery banana slices), but their cheesecake is nice, and their cookies are excellent with tons of white and milk chocolate chips and obviously lots of butter in the dough.

It was a really a great experience last night. We were not aware that there are new owners now. Chef Steve Byrne, Director of Culinary Operations for the whole parent company, was attentive to the entire dining room- checking on food prep; diner's experiences and quality. It has definitely paid off.  We started with the new menu item- pork belly- which literally melted in our mouths. Our son, 13 and his best friend loved it too. Then we ordered our family favorite- teppanaki. Hubby had the calamari steak (DIVINE); I had a NY strip and the kids had steak as well. The meal started impressively with the salad made at the table. They have significantly upgraded the salad adding fresh beets and a fresh ginger dressing instead of the pre-made stuff they had formerly. The teppanaki chef did a great job, entertaining everyone and cooking the food perfectly. The only suggestion I have is that I asked for medium rare and I was closer to medium but it was tasty.

We had passed this many times while on the way up to the yorkdale food court because I assumed it would be overpriced and can't compare to the many options I frequent in Markham.

I was pleasantly surprised!! This will be my go to lunch spot in yorkdale from now on.

Food: 
- Sushi sashimi combo A was $16.99.  2 pcs each of salmon, eel, butterfish sushi, a salmon advocado hand roll, and a few pieces sashimi.  This one was a bit overpriced, I think they can include better sashimi or sushi for this price.
- Tuna poke bowl was $12.99, this was good value.  Portion size was bigger than the photo looked, it was impressively yummy with a mixture of seaweed salad, ample tuna pieces, advocado, cucumber, rice, etc. and the sauce was delicious.  Really enjoyed this dish and hope they keep up the quality and portion as I will be back to try the Salmon poke bowl and Ramen next time.

Service: food came fast, we arrived 11:30 so no issues with getting seated right away for lunch either.

Place: great sit down spot for lunch or dinner before or after shopping.  Much preferred than looking for a foodcourt spot when it gets busy. 

Would definitely recommend their poke bowls, and I'd expect the sushi burrito to be just as good.",2017-07-30 19:29:08

There are hits and misses on the menu and with the service. Some outstanding, some mediocre - but when they hit it, they hit it out of the park. 

I attribute the mediocre stuff to growing pains and expect the servers who don't bring plates/utensils/water and kind of bland wagon wheel mac & cheese will disappear - leaving just the fresh salads, perfect pizzas and tasty bites that are getting better with every visit.

The meat lover's pizza is a total winner. Their crust has great flavor and just the right amount of crunchy cornmeal on the bottom ... this Jersey girl has to have pizza I can fold - and Cha gets it right.

The dining room seems a little hectic right now -- there's a lot of wait staff dodging edges of tables -- so the traffic flow may need some refining. But there are definitely some great servers here and the owner is committed to being our go-to place in the neighborhood. Which makes for a really upbeat atmosphere and warm welcome.

I'm not sure who these other people are that reviewed this place and if these accounts are even real but there is NO WAY this place could ever get a 5-Star review.

Anyway, I decided to take my girlfriend here after reading all the reviews on here. When we arrived there was only one other table with people on the place and I knew this was a bad sign and even considered leaving, but decided to trust the yelp community.

Upon entering we were greeted by the chef/waiter who was very nice. We decided to order the calamari and mussels to start and both had the gnocchi. We both had a glass of wine to start, and my girlfriends had a bug in it so she had to wait for the server to cook something in the kitchen before she could get a new glass (which the server happily exchanged). The server started us with some bruschetta on the house which was fine then we got our apps.

The seafood in both dishes was DEFINITELY not fresh and very tough. The calamari was some of the toughest I've ever had and my gf couldn't even finish it. My clams and mussels were also quite tough and did not look like they had been purchased that day. They were actually pretty gross but I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt still (possibly in denial from the reviews on here).

Next the gnocchi was extremely oily. Again my gf couldn't eat it but I managed to get through it. The mushrooms in it were pretty awful and tasted like something you'd get in Chinatown. In fact, much of the meal tasted like they were using subpar ingredients from Chinatown.

The server brought us the bill and gave us a free dessert which we both didn't like. In total our bill came to $88 and I was embarrassed to have paid as much as I did for the food.

We both felt kinda sick after and I don't think anyone should be subjected to eating here again.

The ingredients seem fresh, they seem to have herbies and such to make them look good, but everything tastes like they boiled it until all the flavor was released, removed the food and tossed the good flavored broth.

The place is still new, so menu changes are bound happen. The first time I came here, they have been open for only two weeks - I had the crispy roasted porchetta, which I don't think they have anymore. It was quite crispy on the outside and really juicy on the inside. Too bad it's gone now. The 2nd time I came with a group of friends. Our orders were taking a bit longer than usual so the chef sent us up a free app of the whitefish potato salad. It wasn't breathe-taking amazing, but it was quite good and I'd order it again next time. For my main dish I ordered the whole wheat parpadelle w/ wild boar ragu. I highly recommend this dish. So homey, so comforting, it's like a big warm hug on a bad day. The rest of the table had the venison pie, and the duck cabbage rolls. The venison pie was as good as everyone's been claiming it to be. Can't really comment on the rolls as I'm not a fan of duck. It was also my friends birthday that night, I had told the waitress and as soon as we were done our meals, next thing we know it the whole kitchen (yes, the chefs and cooks!) were singing happy birthday to her.

Sushi Eye is the best Sushi that I have had in Arizona. All the fish is fresh and I have NEVER been displeased with anything they have served me. Having spent two years in Hawaii where fish is pulled out of the ocean and sliced into sashimi, I know what fresh fish tastes like. Believe me, short of being pulled from the ocean and immediately served, this is about as fresh as you're going to get in Arizona. 

I have been to Sushi Eye about 6 times, with this visit being my 7th. Yum! I had the Climax 2 roll (a Hamachi roll that lives up to it's namesake), the Crazy Horse (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), and the Scallop roll (fresh bay scallops). Umm...yeah... I was hungry. Every single bite was fresh and delicious. Try the Hamachi. It is beautiful and tasty.  I washed it all down with hot green tea! 

Our server was very friendly and chatted briefly with us even though the place was busy at lunch time. I will say that my lunch partners had to wait a little longer than usual for their non-sushi lunch but I think the kitchen was a little backed up with large party orders. I'll cut them some slack this time, but if service lags, I'll have to cut a star...don't make me do it!!!

I ordered a seaweed burrito with spicy tuna, tamago, cucumbers, green onions, hush chili, and wasabi mayo. My boyfriend ordered the long beach. I think if you keep it to one protein and just pack it full of veggies it's a better deal than the signature items. The taro chips are a must, but it was really strange with cheese. I tried to stick to mostly Asian ingredients, but I'm curious to see what it would taste like in a tortilla. 

The place was packed, which is understandable. They had a ton of people working there but it still seemed really slow. They didn't seem to have a good system going as to telling the cashier what people have ordered. I also think they could consolidate some items. Do we really need green onion and red onion? Cabbage and romaine lettuce? Tomatoes and pico? Nice to have the options but they had a hard time hearing and understanding what I wanted for my custom order. Also the salsa station was really random but then again I didn't order any Mexican ingredients. Loved their rice press though.

However, each visit after I was less and less satisfied. First of all, it is a spectacle to see. The Church itself and stain glass decor is beautiful. The brewing equipment on display at the alter is in plain view and for anyone into brewing it is fun to look at. I mean, they turned a Church into a brewery!  If you are even remotely curious, I suggest you at least go for a drink and look around.

Speaking of drinks, that was my main draw as my love for craft beer put a big bullseye on this destination. The first visit I did a flight which had their standard 6 or 7 beers like Pious Monk and Thunder Hop along with a rotating tap or 2. I believe the flight had 8 decent size samples for $13 or so. Now that first visit was great and I took all of the beers in. After a few more visits I can say that only the Pious Monk and Thunder Hop are memorable.  The rotating tap is usually decent but the rest is not very good for my tastes. I enjoy IPAs and full body beers. These to me lack flavor and just come off as average domestics.  No complexity and watered down.  If I go back I will stick with what I know I like and see what the rotating tap is. You can get growlers to go for a very reasonable price which I've done before.

One nice summer day I was in and sat on the patio which is very nice and enclosed with flag decor. I ordered a Dark N' Stormy (dark rum and ginger beer over ice with lime) and I must say it is the best thing I have ever had at Church Brew Works!  And the best Dark N' Stormy I've had anywhere. I don't know what they do but they should keep doing it.

The food much like the seating is split into two distinct categories. Pub side and Dinner side. Pub is more traditional bar foods and is cheaper where Dinner is more upscale and a jump in price. I generally go for Pub side seating on the left (dinner to the right) along with that menu since it's usually a quick stop for drinks. I've had dinner as well but in my opinion it is all small portioned and very bland though the presentation looks very nice.  The last few times I've gone I have skipped food all together.  I should also mention that they have oven baked pizzas but again, small and bland. But they look nice.  I'm just not impressed by the food options verse price compared to other breweries I've been to.  

The service has always been top notch and friendly. The place is clean and huge so there is hardly ever a wait unless you have a big group.

Thank you to the Yelpers who led me to Agio! I wanted to check it out for a while but never got around to it--but then I DID! And now I can't stop! I've been there four times in the last six weeks, it's that good!! I've no idea how the one-star-giver came up with that rating, as the quality has been consistent each time, though there have been slight variances with each visit (nothing bad, just new or unexpected). (How is it that some reviews go filtred while others don't?)

Enough talk about ""authenticity,"" blahblahblah. I want to choke someone whenever I see this in reviews or hear it being thrown around the way people call themselves ""foodies"" because they think 'someone who eats food' is its definition. Please, enough already. I believe authenticity comes from the way in which food is prepared (methods, etc) in that it stays true to its traditional way of being made, including the ingredients being used, quality and specificity being factors too, etc. Contemporary takes on traditional dishes/cuisines is something else altogether, and that's great too. But because a Korean is making Italian food doesn't make it any less ""authentic"". *NEWS FLASH* If you've ever looked into the kitchen of many restaurants, you'll find that a lot of the cooks are Sri Lankan (or at least that used to be the trend a few years ago). That's right, folks: Sri Lankan! In the US, you'll find Mexicans in the kitchens of many restos--I've had some amazing Korean BBQ in the US made by a Mexican, just as good as my mom's! People go to Rome and eat at some tourist hell and think they ate authentic because they ate it in the food's country of origin--not so! To put it simply, I go out of my way to avoid tourist traps and I've been to Italy which DOESN'T MAKE ME AN EXPERT, but I will say that Chef Marino makes some fine-ass food and he clearly LOVES what he does; he doesn't cut corners and everything is fresh and delicious! He puts things together that one may not expect yet it's always good! The décor is a real mish-mash of stuff but once you learn their significance, you'll come to appreciate and understand its charm.

I've had the following dishes:

- bruschetta: COVERED in the usual diced tomato w/hints of basil and garlic undertone, sometimes roasted red peppers smothered in olive oil and pesto. The bread is always the right crispness. I don't get how Chef Marino does this working solo in a busy kitchen! How does he not burn the bread?? None of the flavours overpower one another and you can taste the freshness in every bite.
- mixed green salad w/grilled calamari: two huge calamari on a heap of mixed greens in citrus balsamic dressing. The citrus rounds out the tartness of the balsamic and it's oh so good~
- gnocchi: I've had this almost each time, always with a different sauce. I don't like tomato sauce in this dish so I usually ask for something pesto-y or with butter/olive oil/garlic. Perfectly cooked each time!
- spaghetti with meatballs: tomato sauce; this dish tastes different each time, meatballs have a nice flavor to them.
- lobster ravioli: I've had this every which way as well. My fave was the creamy pesto-y sauce. I should mention that chef Marino's pesto rivals one that I can only find in Montreal. Other pestos are too pasty.
- sea bass: MMMMM, love seabass. This is one of their specials so it's not always available but if it is, try it! Comes with sides that are also great.
- desserts are made in-house. I've had both tiramisu and the crème brule. I love them they're not too sweet and as for the crème brule, where other crème brules fail, somehow Chef Marino manages to get it right and then some!

I don't want to encourage people to go to Agio expecting freebies as some people are really tacky like that, but do go to enjoy the food. If you catch Marino on a less-busy day, have a chat with him. He is SUCH an interesting character and if you've traveled and love food, you'll gain a much deeper appreciation for what he does, and this restaurant is obviously a labour of love for him. It's evident in the way he presents his food, the time and care he puts into each dish which is on a very rare level for this price-point, and the fact that he is able to handle a full restaurant all by himself during the sweltering heat on some days tells me he's a real pro.
 
If you haven't been, do check this place out; if you have, I'm sure you understand some of the cravings I get. I've taken many friends and family who know food to Agio and they all love it. Portions are big but do try different things. When you come across a well-trained chef who loves his craft this much, you can't go wrong. Now run along! It's on St. Clair West, a few doors west of Lansdowne.",2013-08-08 20:03:44

I'm not much of a fan of restaurants that cook up different ethnic styles of food in one place. The only decent item we had was the seafood soup which came with crab pieces and mushrooms. The others like bbq pork spareribs, BBQ duck and a seafood plate of hot and spicy shrimp and scallops were all not appetizing. They tasted bland and definitely needed more seasoning. The shrimp and scallops dish was deep fried, but tasted mushy with the added sauce.

They do offer a range of different options from American fare to Chinese plus some other choices. The prices don't seem too expensive as we didn't have to pay for our meal since it was comped by the hotel. I saw that they have late evening meal specials like steak and eggs, but never for Chinese food again except in a Chinese restaurant.

My boyfriend (Steven) and I were celebrating our anniversary and we chose this place due to a friends recommendation. Steven's from the south, so he knows all about good Cajun/southern food. Out of 4-5 different places we've tried in Vegas, he ranks Lola's as #1. 

When you walk in, the restaurant is small and the seating is close together. Honestly, it's like going to grandma or moms on Sunday for dinner, so I didn't mind the set up at all. For appetizers, we started with the Crawpuppies, hushpuppies that has crawfish mixed in. OH LORD, were these amazing. I wish there was more than 4 per order, but it's still something I'd recommended. For dinner, I ordered the Étouffée with shrimp and Steven ordered the Combo Plate with cheesy grits and greens. As y'all will see in my pictures, I definitely enjoyed my dish. It has a nice spice and creamy texture and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I've never had grits so Steven let me try his and my life hasn't been the same since. These grits are made with Gouda which provided a rich flavor to the grits that we both loved. I hope my future grits endeavors can compete with this one because the bar has been set so freaking high.

Kids pizza looked ok my daughter ate almost everything, it comes with fruit.. love that. Kids chicken was good, I tasted that. My favorite part of the kids meal was that it didn't come out steaming hot, it was warm almost hot but perfect for kids to dig right in. 
I ate the chicken gyro, it was missing tzatziki sauce but otherwise was really good. I wanted Greek so bad and it satisfied my Greek fix. My husband got the pub burger and he liked it a lot, the temperature was spot on and it was as big as my head. We loved the beer battered fried and sweet potato fries.

Prairie was pretty quiet at 5:30 on a Tuesday--there were only 3 other sets of customers. We opted to sit at the bar and the bartender was friendly without being overbearing, and she ensured that our every thirst was met (both water and booze).

I agree with the other reviewers--their regular menu is pretty pricy. We ordered two of the appetizers (sprouts and beer cheese) and the chicken and biscuit entree to go with our drinks. The happy hour special on a Moscow Mule (or 'lil mule, as it was called here) is tasty (nice and ginger-y!), affordable, and served in an actual copper cup that didn't require a deposit! Yay for trust! The sprouts were really tasty, although not as gratin-y as I would have expected--no bechamel, just breadcrumbs, cheese, bacon, and a bit of a lemony broth. I liked the lightened up version as a foil to the decadent beer cheese bread bowl. The beer cheese was pretty good, but a little grainy, and the sourdough boule really had excellent flavor that was covered up by the cheese. I'd rather the cheese be served on the side so I can enjoy the tasty bread more!

The chicken and biscuit entree was very large--two generous pieces of chicken, a ginormous biscuit, roasted beets (and possibly potatoes?), and thick brown gravy. We didn't finish this or the beer cheese given their size, so perhaps the higher prices would be good value for heartier eaters. The biscuit was pretty dense, but the beets were phenomenal, and went really well with the roasted chicken. Gravy was well-seasoned, but a little too gloppy for my preference.

The girl helping us at that moment seemed friendly but she was the only one. 
When I saw our order was ready, the servers were just mopping the floors around guests and laughing and ignoring the prepared food. Since I was seated so close to the food prep area, I had the opportunity to watch my order stand there for several minutes before someone finally broke from their very important and humorous conversation, and noticed it was ready.

Being a native Phoenician, I was curious how Mountain Shadows had resurrected itself.  Suffice to say the Town of PV and some non-Valley resident somehow have taken a property with great bones and overthought it into what could be a cultural and financial disaster.  The details are for a different review, but unfortunately for Hearth '61 a lot of the mistakes spill over into the restaurant.

On the positive side, I couldn't rave enough about our waiter and the food.  Our waiter knew the menu, the ingredients, the preparation and the wine/cocktails inside and out.  There wasn't a question he couldn't answer, but frankly we didn't have a whole lot of questions because of the descriptions and recommendations he volunteered.  We were never neglected for a second, and the food itself was outstanding.  The menu has a good mix of tried and true, and less often seen items.  The food itself was prepared so expertly, and they surprised us with an amuse bouche and little dessert bites (brownies topped with bavarian cream and chocolate ganache - yum!) which were a nice touch.  Hats off to an over the top food experience.

The food and service were horribly overshadowed by extensive construction surrounding the restaurant, unfinished decor throughout and what was finished was in poor taste.  The restaurant has no views.  We were seated in front a bank of windows directly in front the base of a purple wall about 15 feet high or so, above which the greeter pointed out that we had a view of Mummy Mountain.  OK. let's be honest here - first of all, the table allowed only one of us to see the ""view"" because one of us had to sit with our back to the ""view"", you had to crane your neck all the way back to see the tippy top of Mummy Mountain and who ever wants to see Mummy Mountain anyway, and besides what the view really is is a bunch of construction garbage cans and debris in front of a huge purple wall.  The restaurant itself could be beautiful because it's very similar to the former Four Seasons restaurant in New York - big and cavernous inside with a gorgeous fountain and pool in the center over which is a huge skylight.  It really could be quite dramatic, but it's been decorated more like a casual beach shack than elegant desert restaurant, and the tables don't allow you to enjoy the center pool at all.

After dinner (about $75 per person with a drink and tip), we walked the property and found ourselves in front of the most stunning view of Camelback Mountain you could imagine.  In back of the property they have a view of the entire Camelback Mtn - none of the rooms were built to face it.  I felt cheated that Hearth '61 doesn't have that view.

For the price, I'd love to experience Hearth '61 someplace else, but sadly I don't really want to go back to Mountain Shadows for it.",2017-09-10 17:03:33

The newly renovated Del Taco is pretty clean as wellas bright and inviting with it's new color scheme.  The menus have been changed up a bit and some new items added.  Guess change can be good sometimes.  One big change is that now on each table there are baskets that already have the condiments arranged nicely in them (mild, hot, habanero sauces, ketchup).  I guess the goal is to make it seem like you're more at home for a meal.  

But the quality of food (for the cheapness it is) sure beats that other taco place (*cough* Taco Bell *cough*), at least in my opinion.  The food here at Del Taco tastes much fresher and settles better in my tummy.  I dunno about that other taco place, those damn Doritos Locos Tacos always leave me feeling gassy and light headed.  Perhaps it's the artificial ingredients in that shell??

The Classic Taco at Del Taco is one of my favorites.  The crunchy shell filled with seasoned beef, fresh shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce, and tomato?  For only $1 each?  Yeah, I'll have 5.  And wrapping it in yellow paper?  Ooh...almost authentic Mexican!  When these tacos are fresh, they are greatness.  I will eat like a cheap, happy man.  I also like their plain old Bean & Cheese Burrito (with red sauce).  When the beans are from a fresh batch made in store, it's pretty good eats.  Another favorite?  Their $1 Chicken Soft Taco.  I can eat a dozen of these easy.  But, and I say that critically...only when they are freshly made.  I don't want mine made with old flour tortillas, or with old grilled chicken.  Nope.  Gotta be fresh made!  If you're nice and are buying several of these Chicken Soft Tacos with your order, you can ask them to cook a fresh batch of chicken for you and they will sometimes oblige.  Trust me, don't go for the ones sitting there.  Del Taco...eat FRESH!  Hmm....copyright infringement ensues...

Another big reason I like Del Taco over Taco Bell (there, I said it) is because they serve friggin' Coca-Cola!  It's a big factor over why I visit Del Taco over Taco Bell if given the choice.  It just seems to go way better with a semi-Mexcan meal that a Pepsi.  Call me whatever you want, Coke is it!  I really am getting in trouble with these copyright laws...

I will usually get a decent meal at Del Taco for two at under $9.  Thank God the wifey likes a cheap meal more often than not!  Either that, or she just puts up with me.  I have no qualms with my usual order:  Combo #1, make it a medium, double-cook the quesadilla (me likes it crispy), 1 Bean & Cheese Burrito with red sauce, and 1 Chicken Soft Taco.  If I don't want that with my Combo #1, I'll add on two Breakfast Burritos.  Yes, Del Taco serves breakfast as well (24 hours in most locations)...and they started this way before Taco Bell's 'First Meal'!

Staff here is friendly, and very quick with your orders.  Prices vary a little bit depending if you're going with a combo or going off of the value menu.  But you can usually get away with feeding one hungover person at around the $7-8 for a complete meal.  Don't forget, Del Taco also serves burgers, shakes, and fries!  I'm not sure about a burger in a taco joint so I've never really tried them.  But the fries?  Not bad as they are a standard crinkle cut.  Get the Deluxe Chili Cheddar Fries (add jalapenos if you're feeling HOT HOT HOT), wow, explosion in a tray.  Get your TUMS.  You will either LOVE these, or HATE these.  Chili bomb!     

Late night?  Del Taco will treat you right.",2013-04-15 18:59:06

After trying to go to Arriba and YC's, where the lines were out the door, we (2 adults and 2 kids), were becoming more and more hangry. I looked up Mexican places on yelp and this one appeared very close to where we were. It is a little sit-down place in a strip mall location, which is interesting. It was full but we got a table after a couple mins of waiting. If you text MORENOS to a number they have on display, you get a free soda, which is alright. I like free. The staff was nice, no issues there. The menu has a lot of variety. My husband chose the chicken and mango quesadilla, (not sure if that was the name), and I got the fiesta burro. Children got bean and cheese burrito, (adult version), and the other child got the popcorn shrimp with rice and fries. I have to say the kids meal was a good size- my 10 year old boy was full and couldn't finish it all. The quesadilla and burrito were ok, the issue I had with the food was that it was so so bland. The quality and taste was good, everyone liked their food. Someone who doesn't like spicy would love this, but I love spicy and there really was no heat at all- not even in the salsa they brought out with the chips.

Top Must-Get: beef pancakes (literally ""beef big cookie"")
Top Regret: Chinese cabbage and mushroom dumplings

What I'd Get: braised pork on rice, beef pancakes, green onion pancakes. Yes, the only dumpling spot I'd go to and not get dumplings (FUTURE SAM, if you read this, you've repeatedly tried the lamb dumplings here - steamed, pan fried, and boiled - and you don't like it!)


Statutory holidays are sometimes the best days to find new places to explore and eat, since so many of your regular places are closed or packed. And so we found ourselves here on a Monday evening, looking to satisfy some hunger.

It was about half-full when we got there. It's clean and the tables look polished (nice wood finishings), and they've got some Chinese decorations hanging from the ceiling, which is a nice touch - despite that, there is a plain look to the place. We got seated right away, but weren't given the regular menu - they just gave us the order sheet, which has the prices and options on it anyway (see picture). We asked for a menu later, and realized the menu has prices whited out - they just haven't updated it yet!

They have three options for each type of dumpling: pan fried, boiled, and steamed. They're all $6.99 but the fried one comes with 12, the others 15. Some places charge extra for steam, so I do recommend that.

Their selection is different; no seafood options, but they surprised with having pan fried lamb, which isn't super common.

The pan fried lamb wasn't great though. Not particularly crunchy, and while I like the gamey taste, it might be a bit strong for others. 

The steamed lamb has really nice skin but they put too much soy sauce (I prefer putting my own). They are wrapped a bit inconsistently, and there was notable size differences of dumplings. This one is a ""soup"" dumpling, with the dumpling containing juices that flavour your tongue when you bite through... but there isn't a ton of soup. They definitely come out hot though, and that's a plus.

The Chinese cabbage mushroom dumplings were okay. No juices in this one, so it was not as flavourful. If you like Chinese cabbage, this might be good... Me, I like mushroom - a sadly, there was a lack of mushroom kick.


SO WHY FOUR STARS?!

The pancakes are heavenly.

Their green onion pancake is STUFFED with green onion. It's fried to a nice crisp and then they PACK it with fresh tasting green onions chopped up and smushed in the middle. Do you like fresh tasting green onions? Because this place got fresh tasting green onions. This dish is offered in a circular style that reminds me of fried dough. YUM.

The beef pancake is tremendous as well - easily the best in the area. Generous amounts of beef on the side with green onion and a sauce, with the pancake itself a triple layered offering that is toasty and crunchy.

I challenge you to order it for takeout, put it in the car, keep the windows up to trap the smell, and NOT eagerly sniff around salivating at the aroma.

This is the real deal. The pancakes boost it from a 3 to a 4 star with ease.",2017-02-22 02:53:12

The prix fixe was incredible, we both had the Cream of Parsnip and Apple Soup with Croutons and then Maine Diver Scallops with Parsnip Purée, Lentils, Bacon with Port. Finally, I had the chocolate truffle cake while she  had the gingerbread.  The meal began with a tasting of fresh bread, warm butter, salt-cod and potato puree spread, house-made pickles, and broiled chevre.  The tasting was amazing, high point was the salt-cod and potato puree, not only because it was one of the better things I've tasted in months but also because I have a whole fillet of salt-cod on my fridge already and until then I had no plans for how to use it.  The soup was clear and subtle; presentation was simple and well done.  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  Opaque in the center with a golden edge, sitting atop a bed of parsnip puree and lentils (which had been prepared with smoked bacon) all surrounded by a touch of port reduction.  I have but one complaint: I think the menu should have stated how much better the gingerbread would be in comparison to the truffle cake.  That being said, the truffle cake was very good.  The gingerbread, however, was the sort of dessert one aspires to make.  Moist but not buttery or oily.  Spiced, but not overly so and all of the spices tasted fresh and vibrant. I hate that I chose the truffle cake, which was very good.

It's not often, unfortunately, that I afford myself the chance to go to a restaurant, where I feel it's appropriate to rate the service.  The staff at legume was clean, friendly, and unobtrusive.  The best staff is only present when necessary.  And this is true of legume.  My needs were met constantly without my needing to acknowledge them, even in the face of a dinner requiring a revolving selection of silverware and plates.  My wine was opened table-side, without knee or table support, something you may only appreciate after years of working in the service industry.  And my water was never empty.  I enjoyed my meal infinitely more because of this treatment.

The parking was huge for one just restaurant. FYI: They do not take reservations - tried calling earlier and failed to get a reservation. I mean, why wouldn't they take a reservation? I do not understand that concept at all. Either way, when we got in, the hostess said the wait time would be 25 minutes. And about 15 minutes later, we were seated at a booth.

There were 5 choices for this deal:
Pineapple Habanero Coconut Bites, Teriyaki Grilled Shrimp, Hand-Breaded Shrimp, Shrimp Linguini Alfredo, Garlic Shrimp {via https://www.redlobster.ca/menus/specials/default_cn.asp}. What was also included were a choice of your salad and a side order. In the beginning, each person were allowed to choose 2 dishes in the beginning and subsequently 1 choice after the other.. I guess this was to ensure that you don't over order and waste their food.

I chose the garlic shrimp along with the shrimp linguini alfredo with baked potato as my side dish.

The complimentary bread came super quick, and our salad trailed not too far after. The time between the salad and our main meal felt a little bit too long within intervals. Service was decent - our waiter didn't really check on us as often as I'd liked. When we were done our first order, we had to linger about a bit while waiting on our waiter to come to us. We placed our 2nd order and not too long after that, we called for the bill.

Personally, I was kind of getting sick of all the shrimps. We tried all the options except the hand-breaded shrimp as it felt similar to the Chinese style of hand-breaded shrimp so we opted that one out. Our bill came to a total of $110, including tax. For that price, I would probably not go for this deal again as I didn't fill completely satisfied with dinner and the food was just okay. Also, please take reservations!!!! 
Yes, I'm still onto that.",2016-02-26 00:12:21

This time I went there for a food run with a few Yelpers and it was still pretty packed and expensive.

The food we ordered were excellent though, save for the rice dish.

Pork belly and Steamed fish was still standard fare, I eat this dish regularly so it wasn't anything special, but they weren't bad.

Some of the more interesting fare was the wintermelon top thingy.  Wintermelon  + anything is usually refreshing on the colder days.  This was no exception.  The soup was a vegetarian dish, but it was still awesome enough for a meatatarian like me.

The crab and egg dish was pretty unique in presentation, the taste was also good.  Alarmingly good in fact.  I haven't eaten these ingredients in this configuration so ++ points for it.

Although steamed oyster is a standard fare for me, this run let me try two different ways of eating it: garlic and black bean.  Garlic still wins hands down.  The black bean one was a bit tart for my taste.

The other thing that's unique for me was the stuffed duck.  Not much really to say here, it's just good.  At this point my taste buds were already too overwhelmed I can't remember things anymore.

The most interesting one was the chicken / fish mousse.  It's a dish where there's a layer of chicken over a layer of fish paste to make it look like a mousse.  I haven't eaten anything like it before and I regretted not eating more of it.  The combination was excellent.

I'll definitely come here again, probably with some rich relatives and have to make sure I do a reservation.:D",2012-12-08 22:03:43

I'm in the middle of the ""chocolate-lovers"" spectrum.  I don't hate it, and it's not like a euphoric experience for me. In short, if it's really good chocolate, I'll call it really good chocolate and not be swayed by a bias.

If your business features the word ""Chocolate"" in your name, I expect the chocolate to be exceptional. Generally, I felt that chocolate was lost in the mix and wasn't the star of what was ordered. 

I ordered the crepes, which were filled with chocolate, and came recommended.  However, the crepes were flavorless, and the chocolate filling bordered on chalky.  The entire dish was slathered in ""meh."" There was a generous whipped cream topping that was also ok, but the entire thing didn't jive.

My party of 8 also had mixed thoughts about their choices, which ranged from cakes to specialty ice creams, to martinis.  No one was wowed.  It was almost a complacency.  It didn't help that the table we were seated at was a weird shape, and made communication difficult.  The restaurant was also really loud.  

Chocolate, in its best form, should be an experience.  But don't expect an experience here.  The large potion sizes spell doom for those anticipating superior quality and craftsmanship. You're also not going to get ambiance or any sense of romance.

At the end, 4-star seems appropriate especially considering my stays here were free.  The Diamond Check-in was always very quick and courteous.  Whenever possible, they tried to give me a room on the higher floor with view of the strip which was PERFECT!  I could watch the water show at the Bellagio all night. 

The room used to be decorated in French country style (which I didn't care for) and has now gone ultra modern, like the rest of Vegas hotels, with flat screen TV, iPod docking radio, and a huge red leather headboard.  The new white comforter and pillows are plush and fluffy.  The room is a tad bit small for a 4-star hotel and the marble bathroom is nice enough with a separate shower and tub.  

I guess being that it is 'Paris', the hotel tries to maintain its element of romance, thus, using RED as the accent color for the new room decor, quite eye-catching at first glance.  RED is supposed to be a happy color and signifies 'lucky' for Chinese, so I thought maybe I'd get lucky at the casino.  Well, no such luck!!!  

I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that the outside of the hotel is more beautiful than the inside and makes a nice backdrop for some pictures to take home with.  Unlike the other casinos which have the mural sky in the shopping areas, Paris has it all throughout the main casino which I think is quite lovely.  

Le Boulevard is cute to look at but too narrow of a walkway and the uneven surface of the cobblestone make it a pain to pass through.  Although there are some shops at the Bally's-Paris Promenade, it is nothing compare to the Forum Shops across the street at the Caesars.  For a true shopping pleasure, you are better off going to Caesars, Bellagio, Venetian, or Planet Hollywood.  

The Diamond Lounge, open to only diamond and seven star Total Reward Card holders, offers good variety of appetizers, fresh fruits, and desserts if you just want a place to take a short break and relax.  Can't complain for all the free food and free drinks for us Diamond Total Reward Card players.  

The location is almost at the center of the strip so it's easy to visit other casinos.  You can also catch the monorail next door at the Bally's which is connected to Paris.  

This is not a 5-star hotel so don't expect 5-star quality.  But if you're a romantic soul and want to experience some French love, then Paris might suit you fine.  Bon Jour!",2008-01-12 23:45:53

I recommend you visit for a view, it's architecturally gorgeous and visually extremely appealing ... but please if you can help it AT ALL do not stay at this hotel.

I came here this past weekend and experienced something I had never experienced before in a Las Vegas hotel, especially one of this caliber; I was disappointed. My disappointment lasted the entirety of the stay and not once, despite the hotel manager's niceness, did it change from disappointment to contentment.

That's something to be said about this multi-billion dollar establishment whose advertisement claims it rivals that of top notch hotels like Wynn and Venetian. When you go to a hotel, some of the basic things you expect are that all of the regular items are there such as cups for drinking, ice bucket, toiletries, towels ... these are pretty normal. I have gone to 2-star middle of nowhere motels or inns where these items were properly in their place. However, after a tedious check in process where they don't have lines and it's literally a free for all at the bar of check in (who does this?) I was faced with a room missing all kinds of basic essentials.

That's okay, I already told myself that I wanted to stay here despite the bad reviews so I pressed on thinking that they are new, they have 4,400 rooms so sometimes there will be little things missing here and there.

The notorious everything remote was actually frozen, and after several calls to the front desk, I ended up fixing it myself by resetting the remote and reconnecting it so that it would work again. It didn't work too well but I applaud them for the effort since no other hotel has this. Still, when I'm watching TV and want to change the channel, I don't want the curtains to suddenly close or open, or all the lights to dim or brighten for no reason. Somebody needs to find a better software engineer.

The TV was also a source of problems, even though it was the nice flat LCD screens that most hotels have nowadays, the remote was geared only for their programming and the TV itself was locked up in terms of physical buttons so when the TV back light kept dimming itself and turning itself back on which is SUPER annoying for TV watching ... more than 8 calls to the front desk and requests to get it fixed went unnoticed. 

Okay, I will deal with the screwy remote that doesn't always work and the annoying TV that keeps changing the back light. The rooms did look nice, our view was nice (although definitely obstructed by the two slanted towers (apartments? harmon? mandarin? I don't even know ...). The bed was by *far* the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in of any hotel I've stayed at ... and the shower had on pressure. All little things I was willing to deal with because after all, it was nice, it was new, and it was Aria.

Then came room service. Despite several calls to complete our basic essentials on the day of check in, after the room was serviced the next day I came back to missing towels, missing toiletries (why did they take them away? more importantly, why weren't they replaced?) and no cups! After several calls again to the front desk, some of which went who knows where, finally the proper set of toiletries and towels and cups were returned to the room. Why couldn't they have been there to begin with? 

Due to my horrible experience with HAZE (please read HAZE review for more information), I complained to the hotel manager about my mistreatment as well as some of these other little annoyances and he was generous enough to comp me $30 to my room for whatever I wanted (i.e. room service, drinks, etc.). We had talked about this for 30 minutes and he encouraged me to file a security report which I did. He said he setup everything.

The next day when I checked out, I found out that even though he repeatedly told me $30 comp, it was only $25. Why would he lie to me? Why didn't he put on $30? or why didn't he just say $25? I'm not complaining about the comp but if you're going to comp, you have to do it right at least?

And when I went to the front desk to check the total bill, they charged me for a $4.00 diet coke from the fridge that I *never* touched and did not have (I don't even like diet sodas). I argued with them and even requested that they check their fridge with no avail. I was out $4.00 for no good reason. What a joke, most places would just take it off since it's a diet coke and probably cost them $0.10 in mass quantities. 

In the end, my stay was littered with bad room service, lack of basic essentials in the room, faulty technology, rude clubbing experience, expensive room that was not really worth all the hype and price tag, and a comp that was half-heartedly given when I was being repeatedly told $30 and only ended up with $25 (again ... its fine if he didn't give anything but why ... lie?)

I guess I should have listened to my fellow Yelpers.",2010-03-15 23:50:43

The gentleman at the front was so polite and friendly suggested plenty of things to try. Once inside and seated we were greeted by two servers taking care of us I don't remember their names. They were very friendly and accommodating. My husband and I started with a caprese salad, and the diver scallops. The salad was lacking basil, but he scallop were superb. For our entree we ordered the bone in ribeye and the large filet mignon. We ordered both medium rare, unfortunately they both came back over done my husbands was about med-well and mine was med-medwell. We told our servers and the apologized and offered to make another one but we didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of waiting more. Oh!!! And the sauce they pour over the steak is awful is taste like gravy. I'm sorry if I wanted a meatloaf I would have ordered that and not a $60 steak. I understand all places have off nights but if your going to charge that much for a cut of meat then they should know how to cook it properly. Midrare and they make it midwell is a problem. But at the end of it they offered us free dessert. Again service was great but food was not much to be desired.

Studio Movie Grill at Epicenter is probably the best of what is available. They have the best selection, offer free parking with simple validation of your parking deck ticket via a machine in the theater, which is typical for most theaters in cities but still very nice.

There are two things that I really like about this theater:
1. When you buy your ticket, you also pick your seat. This is really nice for those of us who tend to stress about getting stuck in traffic and ending up with a neck-craning seat in the front of the theater.
2. You can order food and drinks to your seat before and throughout the movie. The prices are a tiny bit marked up but it's still reasonable. Two bonuses: you can cork your wine bottles and take them home if you don't finish them and they have big healthy salads as a healthy option.

The only thing keeping this theater from getting 5 stars is the fact that I've ended up with one or more broken seats in my group of friends on multiple occasions. It's pretty annoying to be teetering on a broken seat for a few hours in a movie. And, since seats are assigned, usually switching to a different seat is not an option.

It is an impressive display of history that tells a unique story from beginning to end in a moderately interactive way.  Located in the beautiful old Post Office and Court House in Downtown Las Vegas you nearly forget where you are but never where we all came from.  Some cynics may argue that the museum is glorifying the mob.  On the contrary.  It does, however, tell the story of how the mob came to power across the United States. How they were instrumental in building Las Vegas into the grand city it is today.  How the mob changed the face of our national politics.  Finally, how the law fought back.  You start on the third floor of the old building.  One of very few old places still standing in our ever changing town.  As you walk through learning about the early days, you come across interactive displays like a Thompson ""Tommy"" machine gun simulator.  You aim at a target and pull the trigger.  You feel the recoil.  You hear the bulletts flying and the shells falling.  As you  move on you find a replica of an electric chair that was used on the most dangerous of organized criminals.  You will find actual clothing and other artifacts used by infamous mobsters throughout the 20th century.  As you work your way down to the first floor through the cohesive timeline, you will learn more than you ever knew was possible and get to know the men like Benny ""Bugsy"" Seigle and Al Capone on a deeper and more personal level.  You get to know the hard hitting Kefauver who led the fight against the mob.  Finally, you end in the gift shop.  In there are the customary shot glasses and t-shirts.  There are also some nice novelty items like brass knuckle meat tenderizors or can coozies with a pistol grip.  The museum may not be seeing the attendance they had hoped for but that did not keep Tuesday afternoon from seeing a fair number of guests.  I think it would be a bigger draw were it cheaper for more than just locals.  $10 with a Nevada ID is reasonable but $20 for out-of staters will possibly steer some would be guests away as does the $5 parking.

We both started off the meal with From Beirut with Passion. This is a great cocktail for fans of sweet and fruity drinks. We decided to share a couple of appetizers. The Sampler Platter is perfect if you want to try three of the four Mezze Cold dishes. If you go for a full size dish, it might be a bit heavy on the stomach if you decide on something like Hummus or Babaganuj. Between my friend and I, the two appetizers and one entree each was quite filling. One appetizer is enough to share between two people since your main dish would be quite big.

Food: I had the pumpkin spiced duck pate. It was delicious. For my entree, I had the Ontario veal chop. I got it well and it was still nice and tender. And my favourite part of the meal, the banana custard tartlet. It really tasted fresh. The coconut mouse on top of the banana was a nice balance.

Last night we were walking toward the Copper Wisk when my Fiancé saw an advertisement for Main Stuffed Lobster. He asked me if I wanted to have the special for $29.00. Of Course Darling. We stood there for awhile but no one came to seat us so Darling asked if we could sit anywhere we wanted. So we sat down. It took a server a little while to come over to ask what we wanted to drink. I ordered the 1/2 dozen raw clams. They were very good & fresh. Our dinner came before I was finished with my appetizer, not really a big deal. The lobster was split in half & stuffed with crab & shrimp. Pretty good. Our entrees came with yellow rice (a lot) and a salad of just greens. I actually finished my lobster which was very good & worth the price. I really enjoyed my dinner. One note Darling had the Boston clam chowder that was out of this world.

I don't drink alcohol too often. In fact, it has been years since the last time I had a buzz. But that doesn't mean I will not enjoy a drink or two when we're celebrating a special occasion. I recently met up with my girlfriend and her son to celebrate his 21st Birthday. Happy Birthday to a special a special young man!!! We also bumped into Misti (former Vegas Yelp CM) and Bobby Yang.

I ended up with a Rolling Rock since I'm a light weight.  Because I'm such light weight, I immediately felt the buzz.  I had a great time.

The bar is very cozy and sports a shaded patio in the back. ReBAR is unique in that almost everything that you see inside the bar is for sale. The bar also has a list of drinks dubbed their ""Charitable Cocktails"", in which portions of the proceeds benefit different foundations. Pretty Cool!!

-1 Star: I typically like to try a new restaurant prepared; I like to go to their website and see what they are about and what kind of drinks they have.  I tried to do this for Madhouse, but their website didn't work. 

-1 Star: When I pulled up to the drive thru, their menu is posted so high up, that I actually could barely read the first few items from my car.  I had my head out the window.  When the guy asked for my order, I asked about the red velvet mocha. (apparently it was at the top of the menu, in which I couldn't see).  I asked for a medium with no whipped cream.

I think the total was $6 something.  Out comes this ginormous red blood coffee drink with a bunch of whipped cream.  Whatevs.

I drank it and it was DELICIOUS!  It's like eating a red velvet cake in liquid format.  Sooooo good!  This was definitely more like dessert  than a coffee drink.

I won't take a star off for this, but the red coloring dyes your teeth red.  So before you go to a meeting after drinking this, swig down some water or brush your teeth, otherwise you might look like you've been sucking blood all day. 

If I want a dessert with some caffeine, I will definitely head back for the red velvet mocha.  The drive thru peeps were nice too!",2011-10-30 23:17:11

Unlike many other restaurants so close to ASU, Thai Basil is not part of a chain or simply college food. The prices are reasonable though, and the place always seems packed with a diverse-age crowd. Sometimes this can be a problem as Thai Basil seems a little understaffed in the kitchen, and I've had to wait a half-an-hour for appetizers to appear at peak weekend hours.

It's always worth the wait though. The Tom Kha Gai Soup is excellent, as are the calamari, fish, and noodle dishes. I like to explore a menu, and I've never been disappointed here. Unlike some Thai places I've been, Thai Basil serves up nicely-sized portions, and they do ask (as seems to be the norm out here, but not back East) at what level of spice should your dish be prepared.

This place already has the reputation of having a wait, so my husband and I decided to check it out on July 4, hoping there weren't too many folks leaving their backyards. We went around 5pm and had zero wait. There was actually a large party of 12 getting ready to set-up on the low-tops.

I thought they did have high quality meats - I opted for the Yojie's cut (geisha size) since it seemed like the best bang for your buck. I got the Spicy Miso dip for $2 extra. Paying extra for a broth/dip is not something I'm used to so that does add to the $$$ you are shelling out. They also do have unlimited rice, but not unlimited veggies like other places. The extra money you end up paying I don't mind so much since this place is convenient. I did think it was interesting that as the owner greeted us, he kept on referring to having a nice ""lunch"". We ate early evening, around 5pm, so I was curious if that meant we'd get charge lunch pricing. We ended up getting charge dinner, which I was fine with, but would probably try to go for weekend lunches from now on.

Our waitress was fantastic! We went here to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday and really wanted to sit out on the patio but it was too cool outside.  I've been here once before and just couldn't remember the ""issue"" I had with it until we returned.  One of my main grievances is the limited menu. It just seems to be missing stuff and it was really hard for us to find something we wanted to eat.  The birthday girl was stumped and wanted to leave because she wanted shrimp Alfredo but our wonderful waitress said they could absolutely do it for us.  So here's what we ordered:
Shrimp Napoli- most of us enjoyed it, not amazing but pretty good
Shrimp Alfredo-The birthday girl loved it!
Calamari(2 orders)- The first order was fantastic, it was hot and was both tentacles and rings(we love the tentacles). The 2nd order was mediocre. It was lukewarm and almost entirely tiny crunchy rings. It was like night and day.  The first order came out as an appetizer(hubby ordered) and the second order was mine that came out as part of my meal.  My guess is maybe they held it under the warmer until all the meals were ready. Pasta Woozie- (grilled chicken, alfredo sauce, spinach), My 16 year old wasn't thrilled with it, it just seemed to be missing some oomph, I tried it as well and it was just okay. The chicken almost tasted like fish in my opinion.
Chicken, bacon flatbread-very yummy and everyone loved it.
Kids Meal Pizza with Lemonade-The first pizza came out and my son picked off this black thing on the pizza and put it on the table.  My daughter looked at it and noticed it was one of those big mosquitoes! We called the waitress over and told her and she asked us if we'd like another one. She took the mosquito one back and brought out a fresh one.
Kids Chicken Alfredo with Campanelle- Yummy. We had to add a little salt and pepper but my 6 year old loved it and the portion size was great!
Kids Caesar Salad- Again, great portion size and it was good, I kept stealing bites but she didn't mind.
Mediterranean Veg Salad (grilled zucchini, asparagus, roasted peppers, tomatoes, orzo, farro, mixed greens, sweet garlic vinaigrette, pine nuts, Feta, balsamic drizzle)- Pretty good. Add some raw onions and maybe grilled pita on the side and this would be perfect.
At the end they were so sweet and brought out a molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzle along with a bunch of spoons for us to sing to and celebrate the birthday girl. Usually a restaurant gives you a pretty sad looking birthday treat but they didn't. They also gave her a really nice handwritten card(great touch) and a gift card for a free dessert. 
The restaurant was clean, well lit and not noisy. Will I return? Most likely I will return because they have great kids meal offerings, probably the better of any I've seen anywhere else and the apps we had were good and the bread is sooooo yummy.  The olive oil dipping sauce is divine and my very picky 9 year old son couldn't get enough of it. I can say that we are very guilty of having one too many baskets of these.  Sorry. Not sorry.  I just wish they would kick their menu up a notch (currently two pages) and get a tad more oomph in the kitchen. With so many choices out there it wouldn't be my first but the great location and the nice atmosphere certainly helps this place.

Options after 9pm are very limited when you forget to pack your ""lunch.""  So in the mood for a burger and not having the patience to wait at In-N-Out, and unwilling to eat at McDonalds, I settled on the least of the evils with Wendy's.

I typically just order off Wendy's value menu.  While it's not the extensive 99 cent deals from the '90s, it's still cheap enough to make up for the lack of quality.  But I saw an ad that I just couldn't resist when I pulled up to the restaurant, a pretzel bacon burger.  I may be one of the few people in America that doesn't believe bacon makes everything taste better, but I do believe that everything tastes better on a pretzel bun.  Until now.

The first problem.  I received my order, then drove a few feet away from the window to take a look at what I got but not keep the car behind me waiting.  Although I asked for no bacon, take one guess what was on my burger.  Bacon.  Okay, I just picked it off.  But attention to detail at the drive-thru seems to not be Wendy's specialty.  I've lived in several parts of the valley in the 15 years I've lived in Arizona.  I've also driven thru several different Wendy's, and each location seems to make consistent mistakes.  Order a frosty; no spoon or even a straw (which is worthless with a frosty, anyway).  Ask for no mayo;  mayo remains on burger.  Ask for honey-mustard sauce for chicken nuggets; get barbecue sauce.  I don't have very high expectations for fast food employees, but my bar gets set even lower at any Wendy's. It feels like I always stopped driving thru the nearby Wendy's because of better options and constant mistakes.

The second problem.  When I bit into my burger, I immediately regretted this debauchery.  Flavor-wise and texture-wise, the cheap Wendy's burger patty just doesn't go with the pretzel bun.  The bun itself is pretty good, a firm crust but soft and light inside.  But the mixed greens offer little flavor and lacks the crunch of iceberg or even romaine lettuce.  And I cannot even properly critique the sauce.  I don't know what it was supposed to be, but it's just gross.",2013-07-16 02:07:27

Service left much to be desired. We had to ask multiple times for a missing glass, and we had to flag down multiple servers just to order. There was a peanut and sesame allergy at the table, and the server seemed like he didn't know what to do about it, telling us just to order what we want and then he would check after.

The food was subpar. Highlights were the coconut ceviche and the mushroom flautas (similar to spring rolls). The burger patty itself was quite tasty, but it was completely ruined by the soggy, mushy bun. The tacos were interesting but fell flat on texture and flavour. Dessert was disappointing too, with the most dense churro there ever was, and the ""decadent"" chocolate mousse felt like cocoa powder and cream.

1) they take reservations! Most ramen shops are tiny and walk-in only, but Raijin actually takes reservations and can even serve large groups! I came with a group of 13 and they were very accommodating.

2) good menu selection- besides all the yummy pork soup based ramen, they also have chicken and vegetarian options for those with dietary restrictions. 

3) the ramen is delicious! I've tried a few different kinds of ramen here and they were all scrumptious. The soup is thick and flavourful! I would definitely come back to try their dipping ramen.

La plupart du temps, le magasin est bien rangé malgré l'achalandage. Il est évident qu'il n'a pas été rénové depuis longtemps... La déco est un peu désuète et pas très invitante, sauf qu'il est également évident que les clients ne s'y rendent pas pour admirer le décor.

On y trouve des articles de base, des produits un peu plus luxueux et des trucs pour la maison. Selon les marques, les prix varient grandement. Vous pourrez certainement trouver quelques tee-shirts et des sous-vêtements pour pas très cher ou des articles soldés à des prix surprenants! Pour ceux qui aiment le luxe, Simons offre des produits hauts de gamme à la mezzanine et au 2e étage (vêtements et accessoires de designer), qui sont parfois eux aussi très très soldés (youppiiii!). 

Pour ce qui est du personnel, les employés sont très corrects. Ils sont aimables, polis et toujours disponibles pour aider les clients. La Maison Simons n'est pas un endroit où le personnel viendra automatiquement vous voir pour savoir si vous avez des questions puisque ce n'est pas la façon de faire de l'entreprise.

The restaurant was small as it was tucked in a corner inside a food court. I noticed the menu only had donburi, udon, and some appetizers. We were seated quickly. The waitress were Japanese, so immediately I knew my udon would be more authentic compare to other Japanese udon place. We both ordered udon, with mine the Kitsune udon and hers the Kake udon. We also ordered some appetizers- takoyaki and yakionigiri (pan fried onigiri).

The Kitsune udon didn't have much toppings, only a big piece of inari (sweet tofu skin), and two slices of Japanese fish cake. The portion of the udon was small, but the soup was tasty. The udon was cooked perfectly. 

However, the takoyaki... Well... let's just say I have had better ones. The ones at this restaurant were big, but don't get fooled by the look. It was 90% dough, 10% octopus. The yakionigiri... I don't know... It's salty on the outside, like they pan fried it with soy sauce. I personally not a fan of it. 

Overall, the food was not bad, but the price was CHEAP!! It's only around $5 for a bowl of udon. I will definitely recommend it if you are around the area and looking for CHEAP and TASTY Japanese udon.",2018-03-07 01:51:31

We went for the AYCE and it was awesome.  They even gave us 2 orders of snow crab from the 'deluxe' menu.  Basically there are 3 menus...the AYCE menu for $27.99, the deluxe AYCE menu with a few extra delicacies (like snow crab and scallops) for $32.99 or the A La Carte menu that essentially has everything individually priced.  Some people complain that the service is slow but in most places in Asia dinner is at least a 4 hour feast of multiple courses...so I think they are kind of adopting this method.

First some background. Let's talk about Cafe Rio's tres leches cake. Cause it's not just good-it's wonderful. It's this moist, flavorful HUGE piece of white cake that's made even more moist and more flavorful by the 3 types of milk that it's so deliciously soaked in. But the best part (not to mention the part that makes it so amazing) is that they top it with fresh whipped cream and strawberry slices. It's heaven in a clear clam shell package. For reals.

Ok so last night. Ugh. I went here specifically for the tres leches. The boyfriend and I had done some shopping and we were both in the mood for something sweet. Cafe Rio tres leches. Boom. So we go and order it to go, pay for it, say thanks, take our bag and drive home. About halfway home, I decide to look in the bag (probably just to remind myself of the yumminess that awaited us) and I'm shocked and disappointed and pissed that there's absolutely NO whipped cream or strawberries on either of the cakes. 

'Ok', I think, 'they must have just forgotten it cause we got it to go. I bet they put it in cups and we have to put it on ourselves and they just plain forgot.  Cause they were busy. And this is Cafe Rio. And we've always gotten awesome service here.' (See how I'm so quick to give the benefit of the doubt. Boo. Wrong this time.) 

So we decide to just drive back (cause surely they just forgot it, right? And they'll give it to us in containers and we'll be on our way back home and all will be right in our tres leches world). But nooooooooo! When we go in and tell them they've forgotten it, the girl behind the counter says, ""Oh no, I'm sorry, we're out of whipped cream and strawberries.""

Wait...what?!?! You're out of whipped cream and strawberries? Did I just hear that correctly?! And you didn't think to tell us that when we ordered it? You just ASSUMED that we'd be ok with not getting 2/3 of the freaking ingredients? Oh hells no. Hells to the no!

Not happy, not happy at all. My boyfriend (being the genius that he is) suggested that we drive to the Cafe Rio on Stephanie and ask them for some whipped cream and strawberries. (We're obviously pretty serious about this cake, people!) 

So we do. We go to Cafe Rio on Stephanie and Warm Springs and surprise! They are more than happy to give us whipped cream, strawberries and a big huge ""We're so sorry"" on behalf of Cafe Rio Eastern.

ATMOSPHERE
Trendy and amazing taste in decor. Plants by wooden tables that makes you feel like you are out to a picnic. Open kitchen where people can oversee everything that is going on. Big windows that brings the sunlight in but also gives you a peek of some old and vintage store signs of Downtown. I can go on and on. I do wish that they change the flooring, it just doesn't go right with the rest of interior. 

Check out their bathroom too. Do your business in extra hip bathroom. It is pretty dim so you won't get the perfect lighting for selfie but it's cool. 

SERVICE
Friendly and courteous. Smiles disappeared as they got more busy but servers behind the kitchen table are master of their craft. They perfect everything before bringing it out to the table. They are not just servers, they are artists.

FOOD
Ample selections of sandwich to salad to coffee. I went with Coffee Rubbed Roast Beef after seeing so many pictures on Yelp. Out of all the roast beef sandwiches I have tried in my life, it would probably rank #4. Thick cut of roast beef+pear horseradish=good. I wish the sandwich bread they used was softer/fluffier.

Beef hash was interesting. I've never had a hash before (I don't even eat breakfast many days but if I do, I'm about that bagel life). Fried egg, spam, cherry tomatoes, potatoes, and few toasts on the side. Too fattening for me in the morning but still would rate it 4/5

WOW- very impressed with everything across the board.  Let's start with the 2 pasta dishes myself and significant other had.

Pesto- okay, so Picazzo's emphasizes fresh, healthy ingredients and sometimes one trades off flavor for the natural organic options.  This was so not the case as the pesto pasta that had delicious home made pasta was complimented by sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese which gave a perfect balance to the pesto sauce.  I did throw in some crushed red peppers for some heat and a small dash of salt, but no complaints but compliments on this dish.

Significant other had the Shrimp Scampi.  Now usually Scampi is drowning in an over buttery sauce.  Here again, homemade pasta with the perfect combo of olive oil and butter with lemon and capers (which I assume the good saltiness came from).

Had the usual Jack and Coke and the bartender Nick actually came over to make sure the drink was the way I liked it.  The second one was even better...thanks Nick!!!!!

Will definitely be back to try their other delicious items.

I was actually reluctant bringing my 2 and 4 year old to a hipster wine bar but when we arrived, we were greeted warmly and they were very nice and welcoming to my kids. So I was immediately put at ease.

They have an awesome kids menu with food kids will eat but upscale - PB and J bruschetta or grilled cheese, both accompanied with grapes, apple slices and chips AND a cute little bendy toy - nailed it! There was a 3rd option but it escapes me at the moment. 

I ordered the same thing I had on sunday - white wine blend and bruschetta, soooo good! I crave it.

Combination platter is a good way to start if you're there for the first time. It has a little of everything: 2 momochas (dumplings), 1 samosa, roti and a cup of dal. Dal is nicely spiced and served warm. Roti is fresh and goes well with the refreshing yoghurt dip. 

Meat lovers: chicken sikar and lamb sikar are nice options. 

Recommend going for dinner. They have the same menu for lunch so price wise it's expensive relatively for lunch considering most places on state st offers lunch specials.

For that, I can appreciate them, and gave them the extra star.
The staff working the door were rude for no good reason and couldn't care less whether people had been there before or not (hello, you're on the strip and my guess is that 90% of your visitor are from out of town and non-regular).  ANYWAYS, get inside and girls get free vodka drinks until 12- for this, I was also thankful.
I got guestlist in advance (Google it and you can find a million promoters that offer this) and that part of the entry was pretty easy.  Women were free and men had to pay $10 and have no free drinks (but it's Vegas, so no one bitched about it, really).
Now, for the club itself- it is SMALL. I get that they want to push bottle service- but when they can't fill up those areas it makes NO sense to have them still roped off plus an extra 10ft all around as well- there was literally more roped off empty space than there was space for regular patrons to walk and dance.  There was 9 in my group and it was hard to even hang out with each other because of the traffic.

The only reason that we tried this place was because of all the 5 star reviews here.  It is very much out of our way, and we do have our favorite tapas places already.

Upon arriving, I try a glass door that appears to go into the restaurant, but is locked.  A guy, who is sitting on the ground, blocking the sidewalk points out another door and says, ""The entrance is here.""  After excusing my family so that we can pass, we enter.

We are seated by a female server/hostess (as all the servers seem to greet and seat people as they walk in.)  She sits us, and says that someone will be with us.  Well guess who is our server?  The guy that was taking a break, blocking the sidewalk.  I don't know his name because he never introduced himself to us.  He never asked if we had been there before, nor did it seem he cared anyway.  He did take our drink order and brought us some lavash (which I seemed to enjoy the best.)  I asked the server if they had a menu with bigger printing as I was having a hard time reading the 6pt font on a glossy brown menu with the lights on it.  Of course they did not, BUT at no time did the server suggest anything on the menu.

Unusually, my family did not have any tapas and opted for a salad (Nicoise $19 worth $12), House Angus Burger $16 ($10 burger at best); and Pastrami Burger $19 ($12 at best.)  I, on the other hand, had Moussaka Sliders - $13 (said to be spicy, but wasn't), Cigarro Marroqui - $9 (a bland blend of lamb and beef rolled like a taquito), Falafel $8 (little too well done, ok on the taste), Atun Tartare - $12 (tuna chucks, avocado, sesame seed, ginger), and the Moroccan Frena Pan - $8 (soft, tasty, sweet bread with 4 toppings.)

Much of the taste was bland.  It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't to die for either.  If I lived right next door, I would give it another shot.  But due to the distance, I would probably not go back.  As for the rest of my family, I'm sorry, but it was a thumbs down for all (including the salad.)

When our crew arrived, the restaurant was empty. We had a few moments of second guessing, wondering if we found the right place, but the waitress eased our fears and seated us in a booth.

Right off the bat, I ordered my favorite; Takoyaki!  I find something inherently beautiful in a skilled grill-maestro crafting crisp rounded exteriors cradling molten hot, gooey, yamaimo/nagaimo infused batter and tender chunks of tako. These rounds are then doused in japanese mayo, benishoga/red ginger and wispy bonito flakes- though toppings vary depending on the establishment.  HERE, they were crisp on the exterior and more chewy than gooey on the inside, with a few small pieces of tako suspended within. Less toppings than I'm used to seeing, more solid and perhaps a bit more overcooked. They were satisfactory, but not outstanding. 

After the takoyaki, we shared rounds of sushi rolls around the table. The rolls were pretty normal, Americanized rolls. Nothing particularly outstanding. We tried the; Kamikaze roll [spicy tuna inside with eel & avocado outside], a Tiger roll [shrimp tempura inside topped with spicy tuna, avocado and masago] & a Cali crunch roll [deep fried california roll topped with masago]. We finished a couple of the rolls but the cali crunch had most of it left when we departed. Meh.

I ordered the Spicy Pork Miso Ramen, which was recommended by our waitress. It was  A HUGE bowl, with enough food for me to donate several bowls around the table and to share with my boyfriend. Chewy egg noodles, ground pork and a hearty, umami miso-rich broth with lots of chili oil floating on top drenched in a lake of soup. It was a flavorful broth, but not  anything to scream ""YATTA!"" over. There was 1/2 a hard boiled egg, which was cooked beautifully [the yolk was still creamy and custard] and one gristly, fatty, sad looking piece of pork. sono buta wa mazui deshita... :{ Better than top ramen, yes, but not particularly crave worthy.

Maybe we went at a bad time of night. The tempura seemed well done, but I only had a few nibbles off the pieces my boyfriend pilfered from our friends, such as the asparagus and pepper. The vegetables seemed crispy, which is a plus.  I'd like to try other items, such as their grilled meats, okonomiyaki & sashimi menu before I completely write them off. 

There are a lot of Xs on the menu, and the specials weren't available while we were there. They advertise Asahi on their beer list but really only offer Sapporo. 

 I'll probably be back, eventually. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were suggested to me by a friend who's lived in Japan. I'm hoping it was an off-night. :}",2010-10-13 00:54:20

I really liked how the entire menu had pictures, if only all restaurants could do the same thing! I ordered the Shoyu Ramen. It was good, but they were pretty stingy on the noodles. I wanted a light meal since I wasn't too hungry, but this bowl of ramen did not even fill me up! Also, the two pieces of pork that it came with were cut too thick, I couldn't eat most of it. My husband ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry, which I took a bite out of. Gotta love the taste of Japanese Curry - mild, a little sweet and it didn't have too many crazy ingredients in it. It was served on a huge portion of rice. Now why can't they be more generous with the noodles?

There were even times where no employees were out on the floor. Any customer could have just walked out the door without paying. I'm surprised that a restaurant like this (good food, reasonable prices, steady business) had such bad customer service.

I would like to come back and try other things on their menu, but on second thought, probably not. I mean come on, I can get better service at any buffet in Vegas!!",2010-11-30 20:15:15

Beef Flank and steak pho bowl with tendon.

First off , the base is the heart of pho soup. This my friends was more of a beef soup with ginger flavoring. Need I have to say Tinola to all my Filipino peeps? I believe I ordered rare steak also. Why is it thoroughly cooked? I hate adding chili oil, or any condiments for that sake, but it was the only way I can finish my soup. Oh how I wish I hadn't cheated on my Pho Saigon 8.

When you're couching and you don't want to eat pizza, Sushi Inn has a decent selection of healthier options like noodle dishes, salads and sushi. They also keep late hours which means, when a movie lets out late, this is your only choice for sushi in the Yorkville neighborhood.

But, let's be honest, the cuts are gross, the sashimi is slightly pungent and any place that drowns their spicy tuna in mayo, can't be the best of the bunch.

It reminds me of the conveyor belt joints in Tokyo, which are essentially the fast-cheap-and-easy of Japan.

Pros : fast and convenient if you're on the go.   

Con:  I ordered a breakfast sandwich and call me picky, but it took me a couple mins to get there and my sandwich wasn't as warm as I would like it.  Understandable since it is sitting there.

The menu is quite extensive ... They offer a lot of different things, so there are plenty of options for just about anyone ...

Each time I've eaten here I've done more of a tapas style eating experience... ordering a vast amount of small plates and sharing.  The sad truth is that nothing that I have ever tried/eaten here stands out in my mind.  

It's all just ""okay"" and some stuff ""not so great"" ... I definitely didn't care for their pizza at all....

The big reason why I don't come here very often has to do with the high price points.  If you like to eat, which most Italians do ... It is nearly impossible to walk out of here without spending close to $80 for only two people, and I am sorry to say, but that is just far too costly for mediocre food.

The service here is also so-so ... And if you go on a busy night FORGETABOUT IT!! It will take you at least two hours to get out of this place ...

Overall, I don't have anything absolutely horrible to say about this restaurant, but I also can't think of anything good to say about it.  It's essentially a wash, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  It's clean, nice atmosphere, cool vibe, yet average tasting over priced food.  I have to give them credit for making an attempt to making typical unhealthy Italian food into healthy organic cuisine ... You absolutely have to give them an A for effort because I don't think I've ever seen another Italian restaurant offer healthy/organic options????

I can't exactly recommend it, but I can't say to stay away from it because who knows maybe you will love it?  So my best advice would be to try it out if your up for the challenge and don't mind paying :)",2017-05-04 09:02:11

This most recent visit, my pork tacos were a lot more wet and greasier than usual but I pushed through... The burgers are always a good option too, made in lots of different fashions.

The side choices are limited so I typically stick with the house made chips. Very crunchy and delicious. 
The staff is friendly for the most part... ask for Phil at the bar! (And the other guy is great - but can never remember his name ... dohh!)

We were hungry so we decided to beat the heat and sit indoors and enjoy a meal.  It's a small place with a  few tables in front/side and some bar seating.  There is a patio in the back but it was full that day.

As the name would suggest, this place is about getting your meat on.  We chose the small platter which had pulled pork, beef brisket and ribs for $45 (there are larger size versions of the platter).  The small comes with a choice of one side - we picked the fries.  We also ordered a the mac and cheese with chicken.

As I don't eat pork, my friends advised me the pull pork was good.  I tried the beef brisket and it was nice - tender.  I wish it had a bit ore flavor but when you are hungry you just don't care at that point.  The mac/cheese was ok - it was cheesy with pieces of sliced kraft like cheese slices tossed in as well.  The chicken provided a nice bite to the meal. 

The fries, well I didn't like so much - neither did my friends.  They were meh at best.  I'd be curious to try a few other items on the menu but I don't think I would rush back.

Top shape. Top of the mountain. King of the Playground. Etc. Etc. And The Cowfish? Well let's just say that it's got serious potential to possibly send every other restaurant in town out of business and cure cancer. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD.

After coming here a few times on a few different nights, I have yet to find anything I don't eat, see or hear that makes me go ""Wow..."". From the service (Channon is one of the managers and went above, beyond and around the corner to make an order right for us one night), to the decor (so Japanese/modern/fun/dark/chic/simple - if that's possible?), to the food (Shut the Front Door Good!), it's just a fact that The Cowfish is really just that good.

Reservations are only accepted for 1/3 of the place, so they're hard to get but I've never had a problem strolling up to the bar and getting a seat. If that's not your thing, they encourage you to call ahead and get a feel for the wait time. Whatever it is, though, wait. It's worth it :)

We've tried the Summer rolls (4 to an order, with a few great fried chips plus a savory, light chili sauce for dipping) as well as the Crab Ragoon dip and both were top notch. So good you will consider ordering them as meals the next time you come in!

The Burgiri is just an orgasm in your mouth waiting to happen. So just try it and thank me later, OK? The actual sushi rolls are the freshest I've tasted in Charlotte - between the basic rolls (cali, philly) and the more complex specialty rolls, they're beautiful, well constructed and amazingly flavorful. A tip would be to ask the waiter to have it cut into 10 pieces - the rolls are a bit too big otherwise to fit in one bite!

I have not had the milkshakes yet, but will make that my priority when I go back (again) tonight!

Often times com tam, or broken rice, is often overlooked. Well, at least I have been overlooking it because I had never even tried it until today. Honestly, I had always assumed it was a hard rice for some stupid reason. I guess I just thought that something soft couldn't be broken. (That sounds like a lyric from an 'awesome' 80s hair metal ballad.)

Well, you won't find any Scorpions at Bosa 1, but you will find plenty of broken rice, and I like these little grains. As I discovered, broken rice is teeny-grained, sticky white rice, and I guess it isn't rocket science, but it is literally the grains broken during processing and transport, i.e. the cheap stuff, but I still think it is the good stuff. 

I went to Bosa today for an unofficial gathering of yelpers (UYE). The place is small and simple. The bathroom is in the kitchen, which is a good thing if you like to spy on what is happening back there. Everything happening back there appeared legit other than the toilet itself, which was having flushing issues. Just saying. 

The server/owner/head chef was incredibly nice and informative. She explained that despite the giant pho sign out front, they did not have it today because they were missing one ingredient. Plus, she said it takes 6 hours to make, which means she would have to arrive at 3am. All of that made me pretty confident in the level of care that was going into the food. She isn't just going to throw something together and sling it in the microwave!

Fellow yelper Blair B ordered Nem Nuong Cuon, a healthy spring roll wrapped in soft rice paper with grilled pork. The owner explained that they came with (I think) a 16 ingredient peanut sauce. She assured us that 99.9% of everything is homemade, including what appeared to be a rotating selection of fresh, intriguing beverages. Impressive. The spring roll had what I would compare to a Taiwanese sausage on the inside, but despite the sausage, it tasted light and healthy, much unlike an egg roll.

I ordered a small plate that came with BBQ chicken and shrimp and a little salad of pickled vegetables (and the broken rice). What I enjoyed about my meal was the straightforward nature of the ingredients. The flavors were clean and simple, not overpowering or heavy. 

I think I will definitely return. If you want an introduction to another side of Vietnamese cuisine, this is a very safe and friendly option, and remember, soft things can be broken. So take it easy on the hearts, but feel free to go to town on the rice!",2010-03-27 00:53:49

I did enjoy the BBQ available for purchase. The best items were the keilbasa and the brisket. I am hardly on this side of town, but for this BBQ I might have to change that.

I had the best best experience with the Doubletree for hosting my reception.  My main contact - Mimi - was FANTASTIC.  She was very informative, on top of everything, nice, helpful - everything you are looking for in a wedding reception coordinator.  Everything went of seamlessly because of her wonderful decorating and organization.  Even during the reception, several things came up that I hadn't planned for (i.e. dollar dance).  After I shrugged my shoulders and said 'sure', next thing I knew it was organized and they even gave us a bag for the money.  I have no idea where that came from, but it seemed to appear out of nowhere.  Like I said, on top of things, and super organized.   

The food was good, and served hot (so my guests say, I barely ate).  The bar was well-stocked.  The ballroom was beautiful.

My husband and I quickly found out when we ventured over to ""A"" Mountain a few weekends ago how deceiving it was! The walk up is pretty steep and will give your legs a great workout. At the steepest point, there are handrails to hold onto if you need them. There are two areas along the way to/from the summit with benches where you can stop and rest or just sit to enjoy the view. Off to the left before you get to the top, there is an area where you can sit on rocks to reflect, eat a snack, or rest before heading back down. Along the way up and at the top, there are nice views of Tempe and downtown Phoenix, but not as spectacular as the ones you can find at the summits of Camelback or Piestewa.

""A"" Mountain seems popular with walkers/runners who make a few trips up and down the trails to get an extra good workout in. It's also a good place to bring a dog for a walk (Sophie quite enjoyed herself when we took her) and there are doggy bags conveniently located at the trailheads.

On a hot, hot night like tonight sitting on the patio, under the umbrella and sipping a cold cocktail off of Burger Bar's menu was divine! 
I tried the Cesar, which is maybe not the best, but a good effort. The Margarita is not served ""on the rocks"", nor do they have a blender. Hmmmm how else do you drink a margarita then? Tart and tequila-y, in a small cocktail glass, that's how. 
As for burgers, I never really like the 'bella burger unless I'm at home and only paying for the price of the 'shroom.  So, I opted for the veggie pattie, which was so darn tasty. It wasn't til the end that I think this might have some aspect of falafel to it... 
Anyway, with cheddar cheese and all the regular toppings, I am stuffed.  No, it's not McDo-cheap. It's also probably not worth it to upgrade to the Wagyu beef. But, a side of sweet potato fries to share (huge portions) is a great bargain at $4.

The line got long real quick so make sure to get there about 20 minutes before hand to get good seats. The entrance into the planetarium is pretty cool as it is adorned with little lights that look like stars. We sat down and David our host was very friendly and entertaining. He informed us that the show were were going to watch was shorter then the other shows but that he would make it up with some cosmo rollercoasters. 

The show we watched was so boring that I fell asleep. I regretted picking this one and wish I would've gone with one of the other shows. The extra cosmo thing we watched was more entertaining in my opinion. 

All in all the planetarium is really cool and it's definitely something you gotta check out! The planet show they have is one of the best ones and I still remember it till this day even though I watched it in the the fourth grade.

We went on a Friday night so they were pretty busy. I went with a group of 8 and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. One side of the table ordered The Boss and the other side of the table ordered like a thin crusted pepperoni with mozzarella. Their pizza came out at least 15 minutes before ours... I would have preferred them coming out at the same time. Our pizza was ginormous and SO good though that it was well worth the wait. 

Pizza Rock has a great atmosphere too! They had this large random front end of a truck in the restaurant and there was a DJ in the driver's seat playing music all night. He was playing some great throwbacks so we were very entertained while waiting for our pizza. 

I checked in on yelp at got 15% off the bill for us! Our server was nice and was more than happy to apply the discount. The drinks were part of happy hour so it didn't discount from that but it saved us some money on our pizza. Love yelp check in specials!!

It's also fun to watch them stack up at the front entrance just before 4PM, so they can get dinner for lunch pricing. Minutes later there is a geriatric scrum at the buffet when the dinner items are served. But given the choice, I'll take the old folks over screaming children.

The outdoor patio area is amazing. It's on a higher floor than XS and has a pretty good view of the Aria/CityCenter. It also allows you to get some fresh air which is always nice. There is a bar outside and the tables outside are pretty sick too with the clear jacuzzi glasses.

ATB was there on Sat and everyone was having a blast. I couldn't remember much of what happened because of the amount I drank before getting into this club.

Intrigued because it's an ethnic food I had never thought of trying. I checked it out on Yelp, like I do and it was already well-reviewed and well-loved. This only gravitated me towards Carvalho's even more. This all happened...hmmmm...maybe two or three weeks ago. Now, I finally gave it a try and was no where near disappointed. The experience and the food lived up to my expectations. 

It was a late Sunday afternoon (today). Not a lot of clientele around, as I would expect at around 3:30 in the afternoon. I would say I came at a great time. No wait and I was provided immediate attention. We were asked if we had visited before; of course, I answered no. We were provided plenty of time to stare at the menu. The dishes; especially, the names (in Portuguese) were all new to me. Not to worry, there was English translation. I decided on two items: the Bobo de Caramao (shrimp bobo) and the Pao de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread) as an appetizer. My companion selected the Moqueca de Peixe (seafood stew). I would say waited less than 10 minutes for our main dishes to come out. They looked amaaaazzzzing. I didn't try the Moqueca de Peixe, but it looked so good. I would see it's appearance was prettier than my dish, but my dish tasted incredible. It was creamy and had a mild flavor. My appetizer, the Brazilian Cheese Bread, came out a little later, but that's okay. It was a great complement to the abundance of creamy bobo I had left over. 

The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was delish both in taste and aesthetically. I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes.",2016-08-15 01:09:15

I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon here.  I saw Pamela's and thought oh well, if I can have breakfast for dinner, why not try breakfast for lunch.  When I walked in I saw the sign for the upstairs eatery and it piqued my interest.  

I can honestly say I have no clue as to what Peruvian food is and even though I partook in this delicious place I still have no concept into the food except that it tastes amazing.  We were seated almost immediately with menus in hand.  For lunch this place was not busy in the least.  Too bad for everyone else, because this is a great place to have lunch.  I skimmed the menu but the specials board is what really caught my attention.  I cannot remember the name of what I ate, but who cares, because it tasted so good that almost right after I finished my plate, short of licking it clean, I wanted more of the special!  The special was chicken atop cheese curd and then topped itself with pesto.  What an ideal combination of flavors.  The special also came with rice I believe and the house salad.  The salad was mixed greens with a combination of olives, walnuts and carrots.  The dressing was the house dressing and not too heavy or tangy.

Our server seemed a little inexperienced, but I won't hold that against her.  I am going to assume that she didn't know much about Peruvian food either.  Even though she really couldn't answer a lot of our questions about the food, she was swift and made sure we were taken care of.  

They also have shelves of Peruvian items that you can purchase if you are so inclined to do so.  I did not while I was here, but it does give you something interesting to look at and start a conversation about during your meal.",2013-07-15 22:42:04

I arrived shortly after they opened. As I went inside I had to look around to find a waitress to direct me to a table. I will assume there was no hostess because still early but maybe something to work on. 

They have a nice dining room and a very spacious patio. The menu has a basic selection that has mostly popular dishes. Special mention to the menu presented has a folded Toronto Map.

My waitress was nice and personable. I was debating between the Deluxe Burger or the Tijuana salad. She said she could combine both, great! She also came often to check on me.

Burger was very tasty (4/5) but somewhat very juicy / greasy so eat it fast! My hands became so full of oil/sauce that I decided to finish it with a fork and knife. The bun was nicely baked and it's also made in house, a great touch from a chain restaurant. 

The Tijuana Ceasar had a nice kick as well (4/5). I just wish I could taste the avocado a bit more in the dressing. A somewhat bigger portion would be great too. 

The only little let down was that they only offered brewed coffee. A espresso machine is not only a great investment, it's a necessity!

Let's start with the decor it's dim which I always like.  There is ton's of mobster and rock band memorabilia on the walls.  If I had a den this is what I would like it too look like.  There is a bunch of  T.V.'s playing a variety of things mostly sports.   Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to sit at the bar and have a few, but I look forward too it.

The food is real good.  I really like the house salad the small could actually feed two.  Now the pie's Like any other place they have a wide range of toppings.  But what most places don't have is the option for New York style which is shredded Mozzarella and the Neapolitan style which is whole slices of Mozzarella.  I like both so I tend to go with a few people so we can get both.  

If your in the mood for something different instead of the normal pep or sausage pizza's try the Kalamata Olive and Artichoke combo it is excellent.  My only gripe about the pie's here are they are a bit watery not at the crust but at the tip.  Other than that it's really good.

Although I've only eaten here one time, I enjoyed a Prime Rib, salad, baked potato in lieu of fries, plus a dessert (chocolate cake).  My friends had the Prime Rib Dip (prime rib on french roll sandwich, pickles, olives, fries, and  au jus).  We each spent approximately $13 (with tip) for our meals.  All i can say is YUMMY!

The salad was so-so.  It was basically what you'd expect for a side salad (tomato, lettuce, croutons, etc).  Nothing to write home about.

My boyfriend had the prime rib, but instead of a salad had opted for the chili, along with chocolate ice cream.  The chili was fairly ok, and chocolate ice cream is basically chocolate ice cream.  There were also some rolls that they served with our entrees, which were also pretty good.

The prime rib entrees, however, were a different story.  Each were cooked according to our specifications.  The size of the prime rib was approximately 8 oz. each.  They were definitely monster-sized portions, and we definitely didn't end up cleaning our plates.

The prime rib dips (sandwiches) were served on a seasoned french roll with garlic and butter.  Heavenly.  Not only was the meat cooked well, but the garlic and butter mixed on the bread was a perfect touch.  In addition, the fries were quite crispy (not soggy) and seasoned.  

The chocolate cake was a generous piece, but was definitely moist and delicious.  I ended up eating the entire thing by myself.

Overall, a great experience. The portions were huge and the service was pretty good.  Although I kept waiting (anxiously) in anticipation of the entree, I was definitely well pleased with my choice.  I will definitely be coming back here for another prime rib dinner/prime rib dip.  With prices like these, why not?",2011-02-17 00:40:44

This location has a tiny kitchen which servers ""diner-style"" dishes. Indoors, there are only several tables to sit and I imagine that in the winter those spots fill up fairly quickly. The patio on the other hand had plenty of tables. So if you're in the mood for some house-made Challah and maybe a mimosa--this is a good place to start. 

I ordered the Beet It Salad, while lunch date ordered a Latke with a poached egg and salad. Now, the food was really nothing special--typical diner eats.

These types of restaurant seem to be all the craze the last year or so in the Fremont area.  PublicUs does not disappoint in the genre.  A little different from other sit down establishments, you get in line to order and then find a seat afterwards.  

We went for brunch and noticed that most of the menu items were around$7-$10.  We had a breakfast sandwich and a pesto, scrambled egg dish.  The sandwich was as good as it gets, though a little messy.  The scrambled eggs were unique but honestly the dish was not a good rendition on scrambled eggs.  I think they were trying too hard to make it new and unusual but seemed to miss.  The coffee was good but small and over-priced.

Still the atmosphere and bakery items looked exceptional.  It has a Portland type of feel but it's located in a slummy part of downtown.  I liked it.  I would definitely come back and try their lunch menu as they don't close until 7pm, unlike many of the other similar venues in the area.  They also have some good beers and a solid HH from 3pm-close with beers at $3, so for that reason alone I will have an updated review coming shortly.",2016-07-17 23:55:14

The bar had plenty of seating so we grabbed some seats and ordered drinks. Our bartender was nice enough to accommodate our request for the Spartans game.

Onto the menu! They have a nice beer selection, and the menu for pizza is huge. It's divided into all these different styles. There's really no small, medium, large. Each style of pizza comes in a set size. 

We picked the New Yorker, which I would say feeds about 3 people. I wanted to order more things, but the BF knew my eyes were much hungrier than my stomach, and plus we didn't have anywhere to store leftovers as we were going to the festival after. Good call because I was stuffed. Anyway, OMG, this pizza was SOOOO GOOD!  I think it was pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, fresh mozzerella, and little dollops of ricotta on a thin chewy crust. Everything about this pizza was amazing. In fact, I think I even said, ""This might be the best pizza I've ever eaten."" 

When I came to Pizza Rock for the Yelp Elite event, I have to say I was not that impressed. It's probably because they weren't prepared for how many people were there and everything was just chaos and the food wasn't prepared as well. Who knows. All I know is this time around the pizza was on point!

My only complaint is that the drinks are so expensive. $12 for a Moscow Mule? Aren't we downtown at a pizza joint? I guess that's downtown prices now. Either way, I can't WAIT to go back and get more pizza!  Also, they serve by the slice at the window by the entrance.",2014-10-29 21:46:23

I love Harkin's even more after watching a couple of movies in Maui.  Most horrible seats!  I was twitching and repositioning all throughout a movie.  Not at a Harkin's!    We're definitely spoiled rotten.

Bad design, though.  Most malls have the theater located right  smack in the middle of the food court.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  But, nooooo, whoever is the genius isolated the food court from the rest of the mall inside a building nobody ever walks through.  It's empty besides Claire Accessories.  I hope someone figures out what to make of the unusable space. 

Back to the theatre.  There is a little play area for kiddies in case you want to drop off your children.  Honestly, I can't take my little cutie pie to the movies only to burst his bubble to tell him that he is not going to watch a movie at the movie theatre.  I actually use that play area as a threat if he doesn't behave and be quiet while we watch, he's going to be dropped off there.  It works everytime!

As a bonus incentive, he gets a little kid's popcorn, sprite and little gummy bear treat for $4.  I try to remember to bring the refillable cups for $1...okay, ""try"" is the word.  We always end up drinking bottled water anyway.

the service.  when we walked in the waitress seemed to be adept at being the problem solver, however, slowly this role for her, became more difficult and intrusive.  we were (ironically enough) a party of three at around one pm on a friday for lunch and there was not a three person table available.  there seemed to be only one three person table available for seating in general (lets give them the benefit and say there was 2 three person tables) and so we were relegated to a two person at the front of the restaurant decorated with a third chair.  not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal.   i will say though, with no regret, that it is worth it for them to reconsider how many two person tables they have versus three.  if they are popular or getting to be, this is something they might need to reexamine.  the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience.  every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself.  its not the problem of the customer.  its her job to figure out how to make that work for herself.

for lunch table 17 serves sandwiches, salads and a soup.  we each had a sandwich, a salad, a coffee or tea and the bill came out to be about 60 bucks with tax and tip.  not exorbitant and not cheap.  though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home.  in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not.  but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti.  its fair to assume for the general population that 9 bucks is a hefty price for a sandwich and with that in mind one might put their ingredients where there outstretched palm is.

that being said the sandwiches tasted great.  (one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of ""well then what the hell is he complaining about"").

the vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.

i enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.

all my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.",2008-12-13 06:32:05

There is a relatively large selection of fresh fruits and vegetables all offered at extremely reasonable prices.  

The dry goods section is not quite as impressive as larger stores like T & T but they cover all the basics.

The prepared goods at this store is not bad.  In fact, it is much better than the prepared goods at T & T.  At T & T all the prepared foods have a fairly strong preservative taste and smell that really turns me off.  

One of my favourite things to purchase at the Lucky Moose is a collection of prepared tofu/ bean curd offered in an aluminum(?) container in the tofu section of the store - far left/ opposite side of the fresh veggies. The cost is $4.99 but totally worth it since you can make a meal out of it with some white rice.  This is far superior to the similar tofu/ bean curd collection sold at T & T.  The deep fried tofu balls are also extremely tasty too.  And I have just discovered fresh shanghai noodles for $1.29 - delicious!!!

There is an elevated second floor - accessible by ramp or stairs - that features a meat area and a prepared foods section.  Food up on this second floor is not too bad ... not restaurant quality but it is extremely reasonably priced i.e., purchased a deep fried crab type thing and I think it was less than $5 - can't quite remember.  

Western foods are not overly priced - I have found oreos sold for $3 and I think the price of chips are also competitive.    

Although the aisles are narrow and the place typically crowded, this grocery store truly does make an effort to be accessible to the handicap (or in my case, baby in a stroller).

It was four large pieces of falafel over a salad served with fresh pita. Their falafel had been my favorite.  Crisp on the outside and flavorful on the inside. It wasn't dry, which is usually my issue with falafel. I was full after this. 

I ordered a veggie plate where you get to choose between various items. I got the stuffed grape leaves, smoked eggplant, fattoush and spicy potatoes. The grape leaves were good, but I wish more rice was inside. The smoked eggplant was my least favorite on the plate, but it definitely has a smoky flavor. I spread it more on that delicious pita.

I didn't see Thai Iced Tea or Coffee on the menu, which I like to order when I'm having Thai food.  We asked the waiter about it and we were in luck!  They JUST got Thai Iced Tea and it was good, not too sweet for $2.75.

The decor is nice and colorful and they have window seats available.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor.

We stopped by Saturday night after a lonnnnnng day of home repairs. The hubs deserved some good eats, so we headed over to the Brat Haus, as my hubs is a lover of all thing meat. (Wait, that can come off in a bad way... nevermind. He loves dead animal. How about that?)

We arrived shortly after a massive rain storm had hit, and the sky was still pretty dark & grey. The hostess immediately went to serve us outside, and I asked ""What is the plan should it start to rain again?"" Her answer: ""Ummm... I guess just run as fast as you can inside."" Cute. I'm 6 months pregnant. Not happening. I ask her if there is anything inside available - and she says no. I told her we'd wait. And she sort of huffed back to the hostess stand. Sorrrryyyyy for not wanting to get stuck in the rain.

We get back to the hostess area, and take a seat. We took a look and see how the place had changed from the Oregano's days. It was really neat! They took the parking area and created a large patio-type-seating place. Definitely would be great on a spring afternoon. As we were told that it'd be 15 minutes before we could be sat, imagine our surprise when moments later the hostess walked over and said, ""I just bused a table inside for you, so we are set."" Hooray!

We walked inside, and to our surprise THERE WAS NO ONE SEATED INSIDE. Well, that's a lie, there were two couples. But there were about 15 seats available. Seriously? No seating inside? I get annoyed with bad service far more than I get annoyed by bad food. 

So we sit. Our server pops over and explains the menu. Quite an interesting selection of Brats, and I was happy to see they had burgers & salads as well. The hubs ordered a beer (forgot the name) and I ordered a root beer. We also ordered a pretzel to split.

The pretzel came, and was HOT. Fresh out of the oven, which is awesome, however it was SO hot we couldn't eat it for about five minutes while it cooled. When it was cooled, we took bites and it was good! Not life changing, but it worked. The root beer was Dad's Rootbeer, served ice-cold out of the bottle. The hubs said his beer was 'thick'. I took his word for it, but he finished it & liked it.

 For dinner, the hubs ordered the 'celebrity chef special' brat which that week was something by Justin Beckett, and I ordered a cheese burger. We also ordered a side of fries to split.

The food came quickly and was yummy. The hubs ordered his Brat with the rootbeer onions on top, which were OK, but he thinks he'll go a different direction in the future. My burger was awesome - perfectly cooked and the sides & sauces on top were perfectly mixed. The 'Hush Hush' sauce they put on top is basically a thousand island... or McDonald's 'Secret' sauce. Get it? Hush-Hush vrs Secret Sauce? Hilar.

The fries were good, and the sauce we had selected - the Blue Cheese Bacon - to dip them in was good. Kind of watery, but you definitely got a smoked bacon taste as you ate.

We were meeting friends for dessert or I would have been ALL OVER the shakes or floats I saw heading out of the kitchen. 

We'll definitely go back and try more menu items... I'll just make sure not to have high expectations for the hostess staff. For now at least...",2012-07-16 20:59:08

This place has been on my ""to do"" list since I lived here 3 yrs ago.  I've tried at least a dozen times to go, but because this place is so small, the wait is usually very long and I'm not patient enough to wait in a long line for Ramen.  However, this past trip we went at a great time in-between lunch/dinner when there was no wait list.

I ordered:

The portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to.  If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3/4 those portions.  The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot.  The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.

Other notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.  There's also counter seating available for convenience.  We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.

Did it live up to the hype?  It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.

My husband really wanted a burger, but I could not stomach the thought of drive-thru.  After a quick review of the places near us, we bit the bullet and tried something new.  We ordered take out so I can't comment on the restaurant since I sent the Hubs to pick it up.  I did, however, call in the order. The guy on the phone was very nice.  I did almost have a heart attack when he said it was going to be $27 for 2 burgers and fries. Let me tell you, after sampling the fare, TOTALLY worth the price!!

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan chicken burger with Cheddar & Ale fries. OMG, delish!!  The chicken burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the flavor of the marinara and parmesan crisp mingled so well with it, and the brioche bun was light and flavorful. An excellent combination. Then the Cheddar & Ale fries were a delight. The fries by themselves were great. But the sauce was even better. My husband loved the fries but was not a fan of the Cheddar & Ale sauce, but he hates alcohol and it has a very beer finish (as it should since Ale is in the title).  So if you don't like alcohol, I don't recommend it.

He ordered the OMG burger and OMG he thought it was great. He usually can power through a double burger just about anywhere, but this was so big he couldn't finish. Unless you haven't eaten all day, the result may be the same for you. He recommends just get 1 patty and will do that in the future. But the flavor was great and it was perfectly cooked.

The service was wonderful and courteous. Now, when they bring out the hot tea without asking and its complimentary, that is old school and what I am used to. The crispy wonton skins was an added plus.

The waitress made up the mu shu pork with the pan cakes. They used a lot of bean sprouts which took away some of the flavor but it still was good. As for the Peking Pan Fried noodles, I guess I like the Hong Kong style of noodles better which is more crisp. It looked like they added the Chow King noodles from the can and had the sauce soften them. Again, there were a lot of bean sprouts in the dish. The crispy duck was good, but my wife thought it was a little dry. I loved it. Told her she should have ordered the Roast Duck instead.

I know that this is a barber shop and not a salon, but am still in shock by lack of attention.

Without trying to stereotype, she was one of those recent immigrants from my home land where such practices are likely normal.

So it came down to two choices here: ignore the fact that these things probably happen at most restaurants and we just don't see them (especially the kitchen) and continue coming here to eat or stop coming cos I can't seem to get that image out of my head.  I choose the latter.  Without getting into too much detail, I'll just say eat here if you can block out what I just told you here or bring your own table cleaning cloth and wipe all your utensils before eating.  I'm not sure if she still works there but I'm not taking any chances. I prefer other finer/cleaner establishments regardless of the price.   3 stars here for the food, price, service and one star for cleanliness.",2010-11-24 08:01:33

I did call first and order over the phone to make sure they would be ready. The guy I talked to on the phone was super nice and accommodating. I needed them fast, and they said that was no problem. I just told them to put in their favorites.

The ones I got were:

3 / Tickle Me Pink
3 / Lemon Creme
3 / Southern Belle
3 / Chocolate Passion
1 / Kir Royale (regular sized cupake)
1 / PB and chocolate

The mini cupcakes were beautiful looking. The cake was a bit too dense for my liking, it lacked flavor. It was a little hard to get down. A lot of icing as well! (Also thick in consistency) I would recommend asking your box to be labeled. I had no idea which was which when I brought these to the birthday girl. 

However, the Kir Royale cupcake was AMAZING. I had purchased a large one worth of a birthday candle, and it did not disappoint! 

The PB and chocolate one was not great. Cake was and frosting were too dense. Not overly peanut buttery either. This one could've been better. 

Overall, very pleased with the service, turn around time, and visual wow factor of the cakes. I think they can improve on the density and flavors of both their cupcake and icing.",2015-05-13 17:52:59

Garlic Naan ($3.95) - definitely on the pricey side!! 
Mango Lassi ($3.75) - really thick and served with a thin straw, start sucking

It's really easy to get to off of the freeway and parking wasn't a problem when we got there. It was pretty empty 30 min. before the bingo started but filled up quickly. The space is pretty open, with long high tops in the middle, a few chairs in the corner, and a bar in the back. They also had a Nintendo by the door but it looked pretty lonely over there. 

I had an Irish Stout and the Pilsner. The Irish Stout was awesome, but the Pilsner tasted a little hoppy to me. Music bingo was super fun. They play music and you mark off the songs on your bingo card. It was 80s and 90s night when we went and the whole room was singing to a lot of the songs. Tip: Bring your own dopper to get two cards. 

Overall I enjoyed the experience. However, like a lot of the new breweries in town it sucks to not have any food. The layout also seems a little cold and too open.

This is a prime example how expectation can ruin just about anything.  After seeing all the rave reviews, I dragged my fellow Yelper friend to try out Krazy Fish for dinner on Friday, waiting for my socks to get knocked off.  Instead I was left slightly disappointed.

Stepped through the door of this dumpy looking structure and we found ourselves in some sort of Alice in Wonderland-ville.  The eclectic decor is cute.  The place was busy, so we waited a little for the hostess.  By the door was a big blackboard with their specials on it, so my friend already knew what she wanted for dinner before we even got our table. We got seated at one of those tiny 2-top (why such small tables even exist in any restaurant? After salt & pepper there's barely room for water let alone my plate).  i was pleased to find out about the $2 domestic (Icehouse) special, SCORE!  

The menu was simple enough and just as expected.  I decided on the Cuban Chickent Roti (aka burrito) with Jamaican Curry sauce and squash casserole as my side. My friend ordered the Thai Red Curry with Fried Fish special.  Here comes the ""fun"" part.  The waiter guy (he looked 12, I didn't think child labor is allowed) came back 3 times trying to get her order right.  Somehow ""the curry special"" as we were pointing to the blackboard only warranted a lost/deer-in-the-headlights look from him.  He had to walk to the blackboard and stare at it in order to know there are specials in the restaurant he's working at.  Yike!

My burrito looked good when arrived.  I like that they pressed it on the grill so it's a little brown & crispy on the outside.  My friend's Thai Curry Fish, on the other hand, looked odd, nothing like curry or fish.  Oh wait, I know why!  Because it indeed WASN'T Thai Curry Fish, it was shrimp gazpacho, the only other special listed on the board.  Now, how on the freaking earth after 3 repeated clarifications, curry fish became shrimp gazpacho will forever remain a mystery to me.  

I nibbled on my side salad as they scrambled to fix her order.  I have to say, it was some good berry salad dressing, not tart like most vinaigrette, very summer friendly.  Then I started to poke at my squash casserole, which wasn't too heavy or cheesy, another good one.  Finally her food arrived and I dived into my burrito.  Lots of rice, not enough chicken or sauce.  It became kinda bland.  Honestly I couldn't even taste the ""cuban,"" for all I know my chicken could be Costa Rican.  I ended up spooning my friend's curry sauce, which was deliciously coconut-ty, over my burrito. I would have lick her plate clean if I could.  

The food overall was fine but nothing too memorable. But the service was just mind-boggling.  I know the place is new, but the waiter doesn't know his daily specials? Now that is KRAZY (pun intended). And oh, he forgot her side salad too.  So, 3-stars for now, and I will return and try the Tempura Shrimp Tacos and see if it can earn an extra star.",2011-04-25 14:05:37

It was Thai cooking with Florene Kwok and it was $30 for a 2 hour class. Now, they call it a 'class' but it is more of a demonstration. I.e. you aren't actually doing any of the cooking hands on. Some of the stuff has already been chopped, meat has already been marinated (otherwise, it would be impossible to prepare 4 courses AND eat them in 2 hours!). I was part of a large group and they let participants vote on the menu. 

We ended up collectively deciding on:
- Grilled beef salad
- Thai spicy noodles
- Coconut lime chicken
- Coconut milk bread pudding a la mode

It was a fun evening! The food tasted delicious, I picked up some useful cooking tips, and the dishes weren't too tricky. They gave us copies of the recipes, and I feel like I will be able to reproduce them at home. Of course, it's Loblaws, so they use a lot of President's Choice products that you can buy after class. Florence has a somewhat abrupt and no non-sense style, but I liked her and she was happy to answer questions or to give us a closer look at any of the ingredients (e.g. I didn't know how to cook with lemongrass). She made 2 batches of the noodles - mild and spicy. She also made separate dishes for the one vegetarian in our group.

First of all, their slow cooked short rib with all it's trimmings is absolutely delicious. Combining the polenta with the Asian pear and the short rib in one bite gave the perfect amount of creaminess to go with the intense flavors of the meat. I'd order this every time.

The clay pot salmon is also very good - some people said it was kind of bland, but I couldn't agree with them here. The salmon is well seasoned and the sauce that sits below the farro mixes well. I'm not a huge fan of farro - it reminds me of barley, but it worked well with the rustic nature of the dish.

Dollar oysters for happy hour is an excellent value, though I can't say my oysters were shucked particularly well. A couple little pieces of shell managed to make it in there and some of the oysters didn't have much brine left over. Still, the oysters tasted fresh and were quite creamy.

We also tried the fried beef crisps which were kind of like pork rinds to me. While relatively plain in flavor, the sauce they drizzle over it is an excellent accompaniment and brought the dish together.

Dessert was their chocolate tres leches - a very tasty tres leches, but was honestly lacking in the chocolate flavor that I was looking for. Don't get me wrong, the milk flavor is beautiful but the chocolate aspect of it seemed to be a little bit lost if it wasn't for the chocolate crisp topping.

Our server was quite attentive and answered all our questions with a lot of honesty, which I appreciate. He swayed us towards a couple choices and his recommendations were spot on. The only thing I might say is he almost over-hyped some of the stuff so our expectations were possibly too high (mainly for dessert). But he was spot on about the short rib!",2017-10-27 09:51:38

The namesake ""Slut"" is a coddled egg on top of potato puree, with chives and sea salt. It's served in a glass jar because that's what foodies/hipsters love and makes their IG pic look delicious AF.

I've also had both the sausage, egg, and cheddar sandwich along with the bacon and egg sandwich. These are both good deals for the price (~$8), and I suggest a full meal would be one slut and one sandwich (two sandwiches and a slut if two are dining).

But they don't go bold enough and include really exotic bottles like Alley Kat or any type of imported kristallweizen (if you like rickards white, good god, try a real weiss bier). The TVs are really lame; distracting. This place also has several CCTVs that loops with all their promos. They then put this on ALL tvs when there is no poker/NHLclassic/etc on TV, which is well intentioned but extremely stupid imo... just turn them off and stop trying to market everything...maybe the experience of talking to other people is an experience onto itself. The servers are just outright clueless and are a bit snide. We asked for some scotch and she had NO idea which scotch was available. Being Canadians, we just conceded to the mediocrity: ""ok, whatever well scotch you got."" But she didn't know what well scotch was. She was unwilling to find help, or just admit that scotch (or basic bar argot) isn't her forte. Eventually, we went to the bar, asked the bartender to pour some J+B in a shot glass as per our request for three of the people at our table, and then have that server bring it up to us. Eventually this was done. It tasted like well tequila due to the poorly cleaned shot glass. Being Canadians, we bitched to the bouncer in passing about this (instead of actually complaining directly) while going out for a smoke, so he got the manager to comp all six of  us a round. +1 star for this place.

The interior reminds me of this Canadian theme bar I went to in Tokyo. Logically, one can assume this place is really an authentic foreign Canadian theme bar in Calgary. Regardless, this place in Tokyo was very contrived and had nothing on the walls but souvenirs, empty oil cans, miscellaneous kitsch, and photos of British migrants stealing our resources then taxing us without any type of representation, first wave feminists finding something to ruin, and colonial thugs standing proudly atop a conquered Native. You know, things that comprise Canada's proud heritage.. Hudson's is the same. Believe it or not, it is possible to decorate an interior in a Canadian fashion without kitsch on the walls. Look at the grad lounge at the UofC, local510, or the entire W Montreal.

If I could suggest somewhere for non-Canadians to have a good Canadian meal and experience, I'd tell them to go a block south to District. Way fresher and way more unique. But Hudson's isn't that bad of a place to change it up for us locals wanting to wine and dine in a place that resembles the garage of the sub-sub-urban home we never had.

I'm all for loud places, but usually there's some sort of harmony between all the noises in a restaurant, and that was not the case here.

I really recommend the banquet burger or the bbq burger; if you're craving a burger this will definitely satisfy you (even though it's completely meat-less). I also recommend the onion rings with chipotle sauce, trust me it's really addictive.

They attempted to make up for the tasteless potato's by a complimentary dessert. Mine was Baked Alaska. Ice cream was good but the cake sponge was so frozen I needed a knife to cut it. The cheese cake was not good as it had that ""left open to the fridge"" taste. Should have been covered.

And it would've been nice to be able to see Empire of the Sun and The Killers instead of having them both go on at the same time. That said though, The Killers and Imagine Dragons KILLED it!!!!!

Negatives: Buses often break down (especially in Summer heat)
Drivers -- God bless 'em -- are usually nice, but mostly dumb as a rock, and don't exactly speak the best English.  Especially on some of the routes, passengers are CRAZY and/or drunk/stinky/homeless types. All that may or may not be their own fault, but regardless, you generally don't want to be sitting near them, do you?  No, you don't.      If/when they or some punk gives the driver a hard time, the policy is for the driver to order them off at the next stop.   If they refuse to exit the bus, the bus stays there until either they voluntarily leave, the contract security firm shows up & forces them off the bus, or some other passenger(s) form a vigilante committee & force/intimidate the person to get the F off the bus, so it'll start moving again!    When someone vomits or releases other bodily fluids in the bus, the policy seems to be for the driver to make everyone get off the bus at the next stop.  While this is common sense, remember that for four months out of the year, it's at least 100 degrees outside, and for about 5 weeks a year, it's over 110 degrees out!   When that next bus in the route shows up 10-20 minutes later, it may already be full.  If so, you're spending at least 20 unexpected minutes outside in the heat...

Other than the Las Vegas Strip routes, most of the RTC buses are ridden by passengers that seem not to be able to operate cars, because they're too broke, too drunk, too young, too old, too crazy, etc.   If you're a tough person that likes people-watching, is a behavioral psychology student, or can tune out the world by putting in earbuds & listening to music, and has some time flexibility, riding RTC buses is very interesting, but it's not for the faint of heart.",2016-10-15 10:04:00

The Bad:
- The Sashimi Medium ($35.95) though looks so massive and nicely presented in a boat,  it is the most horrible sashimi I ever ate...

Thai Me Up (what a stupid name) is small and there isn't much in the way of decor, but none of that really matters as it is also cheap eats. Altogether we had the lemon grass soup, a spring roll, pad thai and green curry with chicken and tofu and a side of steamed white rice.

My rice was soggy on the bottom, which is disturbing when I'm eating out. I can't cook rice to save my life, but, considering it should be rather simple and easy to prepare, it's a little scary when a restaurant can't get it right. The green curry was delicious, but my absolute favorite was the spring roll. This is surprising for me as I hate spring rolls, but the dipping sauce was amazingly good!

The lemongrass soup was also quite tasty and very different from any other soup I've had before. My boyfriend's pad thai was pretty good, though we've both had better elsewhere (can't really complain for the price, though).

I'm only giving Thai Me Up 3 stars because, although the food was tasty, it left you wanting something more flavor-wise. Some of the items were threatening to veer into the bland side of the specturm. Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park was much more appealing, but the location leaves a lot to be desired.

We came here for lunch on Memorial Day, after seeing it a few weekends ago while we brunched at Tryst. All the patio/bar doors were wide open and we had a view of the giant wood-burning pizza oven.

We decided to be fat (Hey, it was a holiday! MERCA!) and ordered the fries as an appetizer. Holy. The crispy, not-too-fat, not-too-thin pile of fries (Looks can be deceiving: The bowl they came in hid about half the order. So much.) were tossed in AMPLE amounts of Parmesan, red pepper flakes, parsley and lemon zest. I honestly could have made a meal out of the fries and left a happy camper.

But of course we didn't. PIZZA! Continuing the fat theme, we shared two pies: The artichoke was covered with juicy 'chokes, caramelized onions, various diced olives and ricotta. The contrasting mellow ricotta versus the tangy-salty olives and artichokes was delicious.

The potato and roasted garlic pizza was just straight up unnecessary. I mean that in the best way possible. The combo of potatoes and rosemary is just a tasty classic, while the Gorgonzola added a perfect POW (To be honest, I would have liked a slightly stronger Gorgonzola choice, but I know not everyone shares my sentiment). I would have liked the potatoes to be a teeeeeensy little bit more done/crispy, but that's really the only ""complaint"" I had, if you can even call it that.

The crust on the pizzas was absolutely sublime. Charred underneath, flaky and crispy and almost...buttery? DIVINE.

We also got the Orange Chicken and the Crispy Almond chicken by Yelp recommendation as well. Id say the Orange Chicken was my fave in the dinner as unlike most chinese restaurants, the chicken was super crispy and covered in the orange sauce. My bff loved the Almond Chicken and sauce.

Monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. Don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.

Half of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. You can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. Though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.

There are three types of ramen to choose from; Tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); Shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and Miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). The Shoyu and Miso ramen come with chewy, thicker noodles which I much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the Tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). All three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. You can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, Takana, or pickled mustard leaf. These don't cost a lot, so customize away. Also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.

You won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. Of these I've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and fried rice with takana. The fried rice is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. Another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).

I can't think of any other meal I'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so I plan on going to Monta frequently this winter. If it continues to get even busier, however, I may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. I brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. The noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. Attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.",2010-10-12 19:40:52

I wouldn't be able to compare the before and after, but different is supposed to be better, right? The decor proved to be the highlight of the dining experience. The ornate plates featuring birds decorating the wall, the long wooden tables, the fabulous chandeliers, the handwritten drinks list on the chalkboard, and the banquets were just delightful in a modern eatery sort of way. 

The plain (a.k.a. sweet) lassi ($4.50) was rich and yogourty, but a little too sweet. The paneer quorma ($11.99) was satisfyingly creamy, but super spicy (not at my request) and peppered with chunks of whole herbs and spices that weren't meant to be eaten. I also suspect that the palau rice ($3.95) would've been better with the peas that it is no longer served with (or maybe they should've used white out instead of just crossing the word out).

In the now gorgeous bathrooms, the door of the right stall does not fit into the frame and cannot close, let alone be locked. In the left stall, the toilet paper wasn't fitted properly and popped right out of the holder. I'm sure that won't happen to everyone though.

The service wasn't bad. But then again, my vegetarian dish was mistakenly presented by the serving assistant as lamb and that took me by surprise. Oh, but he was just kidding, it was paneer after all!",2009-08-05 03:29:34

This was the first time I've seen them used at a restaraurant, and although it was cool at first, it got a little annoying having to share the menu.

Anyway, upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly host and waited less than 10 minutes for a table. We tried making a reservation the night before, but they informed us they don't take reservations for parties with less than 6 people. Turns out, we really didn't need one.

After ordering, we were served complimentary bread rolls, which I didn't enjoy at all. It was really tough and dry so I only had a few bites. My boyfriend who normally eats everything and anything, didn't really touch his either.

Since we noticed that the portion sizes weren't very large, we decided to order 2 starters and 2 mains:

- Leoncini Parma Prosciutto - Italian DOP Parma prosciutto, fig & shaved Grana Padano ($9).The salad had a generous portion of prosciutto on top, but I wished there was more fig in it (there was only one small fig cut in half). Overall, just an okay dish.

- Lasagna di carne - homemade lasagna filled with ground veal & mozzarella. Since we intended on this being an appetizer, we went with the smaller size for $6.50. There wasn't very much cheese on it (which is my favourite part about lasagna). The whole serving was smothered in sauce. The ground veal was flavourful, but similar to our other appetizer, this was just an okay dish.

- Palmugiane con sugo - eggplant baked with romano cheese and topped with tomato sauce ($8). This was served in a home-style manner (no frills, just simply slapped on a plate). Unfortunately the taste didn't fare much better than its appearance. It tasted like I was just eating breading... I couldn't really taste much of the eggplant.

- Bitonds' Braciola Infornata - Thin sliced veal wrapped around baby spinach, hot peppers and Romano cheese ($11). Similar to the eggplant parm, this didn't look very appetizing, but it was surprisingly delicious! Very flavourful - this was our favourite dish of the evening.

In general, the portions are pretty small, but the prices are reasonable. Overall, I was left disappointed by my experience.  Since the restaurant had such positive reviews, I expected better.",2011-06-01 15:49:27

Their sides are good - my favorite is the onion rings but I've also tried the fries (sometimes a little salty), fried zucchini, & fried mushrooms. This restaurant also has delicious ranch dipping sauce which is one of my favorites for food like this. The line is almost always really long but well worth the wait. It's fun to watch them cook your food in front of you & they serve it cafeteria style. I will say however that a couple of times, when we've ordered our sides, they've gotten a bit cold or have been taken, especially since the wait is a bit longer for chicken to cook than the burgers.

I ordered my coffee and decided to get the chocolatine since their croissant was supposed to be super delicious. The coffee was decent - it's quite strong for my taste but I learned to enjoy it. The chocolate croissant was dry, bland and there was barely any chocolate in it.

let's start with the decor, this place is super nice (not in the fancy/pretentious way, but in the casual, comfortable, cool way).

The service was also pretty good and the prices are not that bad, I mean, not cheap at all, but manageable. 

We had the garlic bread, avocado delish pasta and build your own pizza. 

I know this is going to sound funny but the garlic bread was too garlicky lmao. The EVOO that came with it was pretty tasteful. 

The avocado delish pasta had also way too much garlic and the pasta lacked flavor. I was expecting more avocado (since that's the name of the dish) but there were just hints of it. If they ask my opinion, I would toss more avocado with a zest of lime juice and cayenne pepper to give the dish some personality.

The pizza was the best part of the dinner (besides the company, of course). If you're not gluten free, the pizza might taste weird but still pretty good (I'm not GF, just in case you were wondering).

For desert we ordered the apple cobbler but they were sold out so we ordered the cookie which was pretty good.

It's basic French fare, made fancier.

(Don't get me wrong, I STILL loved the restaurant and liked the food, but to put this on the same level as French gastronomy is stretching it for me.)

I'd come here for a nice lunch with a friend, and would recommend it as a date spot, but I can't say like all the other Yelpers it was the best food I ever had, because it isn't. :(

The best French food I've ever had was in Paris with a chef who personally cooked for me, and his food blew this stuff out of the water. We're talking real homemade foie gras perfectly paired with fig jam, not foie gras terrines for instance.

Or the other great bistro fare I've had was in Lyons but it was definitely what I'd call ""really good food"" and it blew THIS place out of the water too, and that's just a regular hole in a wall in Lyons that's a true French bistro.

Anyway, the food was OK. I'm a fan because I'll come back and eat here because it's decent, but for the price and what I got, I cannot say it is amazing French food.

I ate the beef tartare which was delicious but a little too tart for my liking (that black garlic sauce was gooooood though), and the dessert was the lemon tart which I found OK, but not amazing, Pusateri's in Toronto makes a killer lemon and coconut tart that is way better.

The restaurant has been nicely redone. No evidence that it was once an IHOP. A kind of retro feel. Very welcoming. Very friendly server who helped the vegetarian with whom I was dining maneuver the menu. We sat in place for a long time after our meal and felt no pressure to vacate our booth. Loved the use of vintage Western paperbacks to deliver the tab.

Greeted promptly when we entered. Seated immediately. Offered beverages. Order taken the moment we were ready. Yes, perhaps evidence of a three week old restaurant with employees who are trying hard to please, but I sensed it might be sustainable. I was a little concerned The Normal might be positioned to become just another bad hotel restaurant.  Happily, this does not seem to be the case.

We only sampled two items. The burrito, modified for a vegetarian pallet, was excellent. The blue corn pancakes were unique. I would order them again, but they were a bit much by themselves and I would consider splitting entrees with a friend next time. I mentioned on a comment card that some color on the plate, perhaps just a slice of orange or the like, would help with its presentation and could break the taste. We appreciated The Normal's emphasis on sourcing locally...

Yeah, its not the best Thai of Vegas, but it isn't that bad!  I ordered the green curry 7.50, along with a Thai iced tea ($2.50).  

The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  It was sweet and balanced with cream.  The green curry wasn't too bad at all.  I ordered it ""Thai style"", so I don't know if they make it differently normally.  The curry is not flashy with a lot of bamboo and a few thin slices of onion and red peppers.  The spiciness was above average in the flavor department.  The only complaint that I had was that the beef was too tough.  I let the friendly waitress know about this exception, so maybe they will up the quality of their beef.

An funny story, I forgot to bring my wallet.  When I went to pay, I realized I didn't have any money!  I asked the waitress to hold my phone so I could go home and get my wallet... luckily I don't live very far from here.  The waitress smiled politely and didn't make any argument.  She was quite understanding.  

I would like to come back here and try some more dishes.  I am hoping that they take my advice on the beef.  If they do, this could be quite a nice little spot.  There are a lot of Chinese dishes that I probably won't try, but it is still more authentic than the other (more popular) Thai restaurant in this area.  Give them a try!",2011-05-01 01:19:00

Since the Eagels were playing that night, Vida was slammed! Without a reservation, it was an hour and a half wait. We had other plans for the evening, so we decided to see if we could grab two seats (or heck, one would work!) from the bar. No such luck. I felt bad cause there were many couples, like us, hovering around the bar just waiting for one of those coveted seats. No joke, we literally stood behind these two women sipping their beers for almost 45 minutes. Probably, two of the most slowest beer drinkers I have ever met....but I digress.....Anyways, we soon discovered that the wait to sit outside wasn't very long and we put our name on the list. We were seated outside (wasn't too cold....they had a heater out there but it wasn't turned on).

We ordered a bucket (5 beers) of Coronas and some guac. I really really love guacamole.....like, it's an issue. They have some fantastic guac. Nothing truely beats the guac I make, but this is a close second. We also chose to split a burrito meal. We were bar hopping that night and figured we didn't need two meals. Man, so glad we split. The serving was huge!! The burrito was delish. The grilled corn as the side was so good!

I ordered the rib eye tacos and it did not disappoint.  Ample meat, perfectly moist, and those tortillas ...just amazing!  There's a condiment/sauce bar too.  I loved the red sauce because it was  not too hot.  Also, the fountain drink machine is located outside so that's another plus.

There are some flat LCD TVs too for your viewing pleasure.  For dessert, we shared a mango paleta (Mexican juice bars) and it was divine!!

Also several areas where short movies play to give you a nice mix of media to engage with. Its three stories and all three were cool. Third floor is my particular favorite.

Utopia is one of the few restaurants that has repeatedly been highly recommended by friends outside of Yelp for years now. However, it was not until very recently that I finally committed to joining the long disorganized queue out front to find out what all the fuss was about. Boy, was the food worth the wait!  

Despite the fact that the dining room itself is quite small and tight in spots, the weather which was arguably on the very verge of being too chilly still allowed the back patio to be seated as well on the evening of our visit. Luckily, we were able to snag a tiny two-top right beyond the door (and the cool gusts of wind that our server kept sternly telling eager queuers to stay outside and keep out) . The dim mood lighting and great choices of full albums (it was Belle and Sebastien's newest ""Write About Love"" and TV on the Radio's ""Return to Cookie Mountain"" that night) made for an enjoyable atmosphere to chew and chat to.

My super juicy medium-rare 8 oz steak and crispy (as promised) fries were sided with a generous handful of well dressed mixed greens and a large pot of satisfyingly flavourful gravy to dip into. My dinner date's grilled tuna salad was huge and reportedly surprisingly filling.

Although the food and ambiance were excellent, the service was the only thing that wasn't tops. Trying to figure out how the (non-existent) wait list worked outside was something of a puzzle. The guests who dared venture inside to see if they could put their name on a list were immediately (and apparently somewhat rudely) told to go back outside and just wait.

When we dared enter the front door ourselves, we were told firsthand quite abruptly to go back and wait outside. Frankly, we were a little bit confused as we i) had not checked in yet, ii) had seen a table open up, iii) were the next in line, and iv) saw a couple of girls who had just shown up walk right past the line. 

Once seated, our orders were taken and served quickly, but we were never checked on again. No water was ever served and my empty wine glass (which I had wanted refilled) stayed as parched as my throat for the remainder of the meal. By the time we finally got our server's attention to come take away our crusty plates and bring the bill, we had decided to go elsewhere for more drinks.

Now that the issues are out there for all to debate, it is without further hesitation that I draw a line in the sand and announce my endorsement for Bar Cento and the Pommes Frites party. 

I could go on in a series of overly bearing, over romanticizing, over the top foodie adjectives to describe just how perfect these fries are. Or I can just ask that you trust my research. Discovering a fry that has inspired a dedicated review in and of itself such as this should be complement enough, but I must say, Bar Cento's frites are so good, they are life altering. Because of these fries, I am a better person.  

Fresh cut, crisply fried in duck-fat, seasoned properly with a touch of salt, rosemary sprigs and crushed garlic cloves.

The rice at bottom of the bowl was delightfully crunchy and nutty and it wasn't overly spicy with just the perfect amount of sweetness. The meats were tender and overall, we really enjoyed this dish and would recommend it.

The fried chicken was a letdown. I was really excited to try their fried chicken but while it was extremely crispy (they use panko bread crumbs instead of a more traditional batter), it was mostly tasteless and way too dry. Most of the pieces were chicken breast and needed some more salt due to the thickness and depth of the chicken. Perhaps it would be better to order the chicken with some sauce to make up for the tasteless chicken.

We tried reserving the laser tag room or so we thought, you can reserve the laser tag arena, but others will play in the same course and 8 minute time limit that your party does.  There was some confusion when it came to this partly on us not knowing how the whole thing worked, but again this was our first time there and hardly anything was explained to us.  The laser tag was the most fun part most of my party had while there and I have to say if we did come back it would be for this activity mainly.  We spoke to a manager who calmly, swiftly, and very generously comped us for 12 half hour arcade cards which even though your not able to try the prize winning games gave us loads of fun on other arcade style racing, shooting, and air hockey games.  Everything considered it's a great place to have a party, but ask a lot of questions and maybe even try the place out as just a walk in, which they do take.  Understand exactly what is going to happen and when, also knowing exactly who is your party host/attendant is key to having a good experience here.  *Update* we went back just to play in the arcade and realized my son never got his birthday bowling pin that everyone at the party signs, this causes me to take one more star off.  Such a shame, the place could be so great, but falls so short.",2016-07-25 21:37:07

LGO Grocery isn't your average grocery where you can stop in and get some milk and paper towels on your way home. It's more of a funky gift shop meets a specialty food store.

After me and my friend were done eating our pizza from LGO Pizzeria, we perused through the grocery. There were knick knacks (scented candles; bath products; children's toys; stationary; etc). There were refrigerated displays with specialty salads, sandwiches, cheeses, and meats.  There were the gelato counter and pastries counter and behind that was the actual kitchen where they were busy preparing food orders, other than the pizzas. 

LGO Grocery offers breakfast items (pancakes, granola, eggs) along with salads and sandwiches.  My friend bought a pack of their english muffins. If I wasn't too full from the pizza I would've ordered an english muffin to try on the spot. They looked like fluffy white discs :) 

The space to move about at LGO Grocery is very limited due to the counters, displays, and people in line to pay for their food orders or purchases; but other than that, the whole concept is awesome: a funky gift shop/specialty food store with an attached pizzeria offering good eats and unique gifts without any of the pretentiousness you might encounter at similar places.",2012-11-07 06:26:31

I've had all the various assortments of Fish Tacos along with the Pork and Cuban Tacos.  The Flour Taco shell is so delicious and crisp, I could just eat that and be fine.  While I usually get some sort of fish, I opted for the pork on my last visit here.  Now, usually, I'm hungry within an hour of eating here but the pork tacos filled me up all night. 

I think the various sauces that come with the tacos is what sets it apart from the other fish taco joints.  It's not just the standard white sauce.  The most common sauce is the Pink Gold sauce which is very tasty.  I was recently taken a back with the blueberry sauce on the Pork Tacos.  It's not something that I would have thought would work but it does, surprisingly.

 I ordered the Mac'n Cheese as a side and it was just ok.  Nothing spectacular, a lot of goopy cheese.  I've tasted the jalapeno grits as well as the Squash Casserole.  I felt that the Casserole was bland and could have used a little spice and the grits were as you could expect, grits with Jalapenos.
   I have heard that the Shrimp Gazpacho is awesome and it certainly looks that way.  It's huge!

As far as Apps go, we've had the Tempura Veggies and the Chips/Salsa with Queso.  The veggies were a nice change for an App but the Salsa lacked a lot of flavor.  They offered two types, Gringo and Hot.  I felt that the Gringo was way too mild and heavy on the tomato. The Hot salsa was more of a smoldering heat.  It took a minute to catch up with you.  However, the Queso was good, hard to ruin but you appreciate it when you've had bad Queso.

I hope to try more of the entrees next time like the Rotisserie Chicken but I'm always lured to the Tacos.....",2012-08-16 01:26:26

After a month of haggling via emails, phone calls,texts, and visits to the dealer we are now the proud owners of our dream truck. 
We understand how much things cost to be made and everyone involved wants to feel they got the best deal so all in all we left with a feeling a satisfaction on the whole car buying process. Frank Mundo was our go to guy and he helped us with all the questions and concerns we had. We traded in our old car which helped with the overall cost. Lisa in financing was a hoot to deal with. She definitely knows her sh!t when it comes to all that darn paperwork. 
*Key to car buying is: to do your research ahead of time on the make and model. 
Know you budget and what you are willing to pay, down to the last penny.
 Have good/great credit. That will give you leeway when it comes down to crunching numbers.

we had a really nice server who pointed out the highlights of the menu and she was training someone who could have been a little more enthusiastic, but was nice enough.

next we tried the fried pickles, now I have had some great fried pickles but these missed that mark, they were a thicker cut thus the breading doesn't stick on them well and they weren't the crisp kind of pickle. although my daughter was in heaven since it has been a very long time since she has had any.

instead of ordering separately we ordered 3 different rolls of sushi and shared:
volcano roll- very spicy and is not for the faint of heart
spicy tuna roll- very nice but I like the spicy aioli on top not inside, but was still good
crunchy shrimp roll- was really good has some tempura fried shrimp in it.

we surprised my hubby with the typical song and dessert that restaurants do, he was thoroughly embarrassed - mission accomplished. 
the dessert was a enormous serving of moose on the loose. it was way more than we could share and oh so good and chocolaty!

I called for reservations in the morning and even they could not get me in at three, a three thirty was available.  When I arrived there were more staff than guests.  

The turkey was a mix of dark and white meat infused with a simple stuffing but it seemed like I got a turkey bum, it was almost all skin and the meat that was on it was so tough I could not get my knife through it.  I seriously have had better turkey in my employee dining room.  (EDR for my fellow casino employed friends.)  To top if off when they sent out the food the server was ready to give me one dish, picked it up and gave it to my husband instead, so he got a great cut of turkey and I got to view it.

Sides were greasy green beans and apple stuffing, both were unremarkable.  Cranberry sauce was so oddly seasoned it was unedible.

You can also opt for a grilled plate (chicken, steak, pork, etc.) if you're looking for something a bit more healthy. My wife enjoys sour cream chicken enchiladas with the house made green sauce. So good.

There's a decent kids menu that includes Mexican and American food options. $5 per plate with a $0.99 drink makes it an OK deal. Our daughter likes the cheese quesadilla with french fries. :)

They have an open bar so you have many choices if you're thirsty for an adult beverage. There are many different styles (and levels) of margaritas depending on how much you're willing to spend. Make sure to check the drink specials at the front lobby to see which concoctions are on special for the evening. Expect your typical Mexican beers on draught- Dos Equis, Tacate, Modelo, etc.

Chips served when you are seated- with 3 flavors to dip. Traditional salsa, hot picante salsa and a bean dip. All are very tasty, the picante is a slow start heat so go easy on it. Great flavors on all three dips though!

Also, while several people have told me this is a ""French"" patisserie, this is anything but. It's definitely a stereotypical americanized version of what people probably think a French patisserie looks like, and its definitely cute, it doesn't have the charm or the quality of food to be anything close to authentic.

That night we lived it up to some raw quality music . Afterwards, since it was around St. Patrick's day we  cruised the frat parties - stumbling along the Pitt campus, looking for the most obnoxious partying scene to join - cat fights, flashing, and belligerent green painted guys  -all major pluses. 

After finding ""the one"" my friends spent the night attempting to play beer pong with brawny guys. One green beer after another....one high five after another...one spill after another....one ""hey, watch those hands"" after another.....it all came to a finale  - as my friend turned to me - his face matching the color of his beer and nodded. I understood. I grabbed my other friend, and we tripped over cups and half naked girls to the still snow covered ground outside - and painted it with our St. Patrick's day Guinnesses. YUCK. I was done......

The next morning - I was miserable. My friends were already all packed to go, both obviously lacking livers . I was in no such shape. I needed something before I could move, not to mention that all my clothes were ruined from the night before. The guy, who had put us up for the night, also out of laundry - provided some tiny running shorts, and someone  lent me some shoes (even my shoes were in horrible shape).   

""take these....just go to Primanti's - you'll be fine in a few...."" I didn't care what Primanti's was - I just wanted to die. But my friends nodded. 

""Yeah jess - get dressed - we're going to go to Primanti's.""

And so...reluctantly....I put on an absurd outfit in the middle of freezing winter - white legs and all, and climbed into the car to Primanti's.

I kept on complaining, in between nauseousness that everyone would stare at my outfit in the middle of the winter weather. 

""no Permanti's is cool - they've seen everything.""  

They weren't messing around - within 20 minutes of a slowly eaten - to die for sandwich topped with french fries, fresh coleslaw, hot sauce, provolone cheese, and amazing thinly sliced turkey and Italian Bread....my stomach had settled and I was able to produce a slight smile.

""no lie - this is the best sandwich I've had in awhile...I can't even taste the beer anymore.""

And better yet, no one even flinched as I trudged out in my short shorts and clown shoes. Everyone was too engrossed in their sandwiches and discussing their crazy nights to care. Permanti's really is one of the best cure-alls for headache and nausea hell.",2006-08-04 23:08:36

I also ordered Peach n' Cream milkshake, which was pretty good. Not too sweet, and it was peachy (just how I like it). Good portion size as well!! They have lots of choices and the pistachio looks pretty good. Oh and I didn't know they have brownie until I heard someone ordered it (i was overwhelmed with their cheesecakes I didn't even look at the menu). I may try both brownie and pistachio cheesecake next time.


The staffs are very friendly and helpful. They were a bit slow even though the shop wasn't that busy. But, they apologized for their lateness, which were pretty sweet. I wasn't in a hurry anyway.

The decor was beautiful - chandeliers, Persian poetry lining the wall, and lots of blue, turquoise and topaz all around. 

Service was a little slow, but there were only three girls serving (what it seemed like) 100 people, so they get a pass. They were super nice and had a smile throughout each one of our conversations. 

The food of choice for me was Dizi Sangi. It was incredibly delicious! It was perfect for a breezy fall day. The broth warms your soul. The flatbread is fluffy and a perfect compliment to the meat/potato/bean purée. The condiments are fantastic even with the bread on its own.

I've been waiting for a long time since trying jogasaki at foodie fest 2 years ago and my dreams have come true. In a nut shell it's really just an uncut sushi roll but eating it burrito style is awesome.

Setting: Right off W. Sahara after rancho. It's in the mcdonald's parking lot. Pretty big parking lot so you should be able to find a spot. 

Interior: Bright but really not a lot of places to sit especially with how popular it is, so have someone claim a spot and get their order while you're in line if you wanna be those people lol.

Food: It's everything you'd want in a sushi burrito (minus unagi). The redondo was the burrito I selected which really is the best bang for your buck. Tuna, yellowtail, and salmon (I highly recommend adding shrimp tempura) This is sushi heaven rolled almost perfectly (it is pretty huge). Comparing this to jogasaki it is about $5 cheaper, and a lot bigger. Foodie fest won't be the same with Jaburrito around.

Service: Friendly but they're more focused on churning through the customers, especially when it's busy it was like waiting for sushi burritos at foodie fest. 

Drinks: They have water cups but they're the kind you get from the dentist's office, so don't let your water sit in that cup for too long. I opted for their apple soda which had an unusual aftertaste, so I'd go for the melon soda instead.

Overall: 30 minutes away from my house and yet it's quite worth the drive. Jaburritos has staked it's claim as Las Vegas's first official sushi burrito restaurant and it's here to stay.",2015-10-25 07:13:20

I was the only person in there besides the family who runs the joint, kinda weird because it is in a bland strip mall, dark, at this hour. They try to make it more festive with Madonna videos on the tv, but it only made it more awkward.

I saw duck curry, and was really disappointed to find out they didn't have any. Last time I had Thai duck, it was in Santa Cruz, only because everybody got quiet when I asked where the nearest fried chicken joint is (probably only place in the world where you have to ask for the non-vegan menu). In any case, I had the pad thai chicken; now, I have friends that are Thai food snobs, but I'm not one of them, so I thought my plate was pretty decent. I felt like the noodles were drenched in a sweet/spicy sauce, but again, from what I understand this is a standard practice in Thai. I also had the egg rolls which were nice and crisp, but I would have preferred some meat in it.

At the end of the meal, things got really Asian when a regular came in and busted out the Thai karaoke. No stars off the restaurant for the performance.

This is a nice place to stop in if you're in the area and really feeling Thai. The family was nice and polite, but the whole abandoned strip mall thing with the dim lighting was definitely uncomfortable when you're by yourself.",2011-02-20 02:52:00

Parking is five dollars so heads up if you do not carry cash. 

As far as the museum goes, you can read the other reviews or go online for the content. As you have probably guessed by now it's all original Mob and G-Men artifacts. 

Mary's top coolest things about the Mob Museum:

*It is housed in an Historic courthouse and Federal building from the 1930's. I love old buildings. How funny that a federal courthouse is now a Mob museum. The Irony was not lost on me. 

*They actually have the wall here that the victims of the St. Valentine's Massacre were lined up against and gunned down. The real wall with the bullet holes in it and everything. Super creepy. I have some photos I will have to attach. 

* The line up closet, the barber chair, the fake machine gun, and electric chair. (Even the lights dimmed when you flick the switch---lol) 

* The Kennedy Room

*The history Of Las Vegas. It was all so interesting.

This would be a great date place, especially on a chilly night.  The glowing brick pizza oven is right in the middle of the restaurant and just makes a place  that is in the middle of a strip mall seem very cozy.

So far I've tried,
-Pistachio with Rosewater - Has a nice pistachio flavour with subtle hints of rosewater, the floral taste does not overpower the nutty pistachio

- Roasted oolong tea - Strong roasted tea flavour, not overly bitter and has a lingering taste after

- Green bean with coconut - Sweet coconut flavour with pieces of green bean in it, reminds me of eating  rice pudding

-  Whiskey green tea- Whiskey is strong! A little too overpowering for me. I prefer the Rum with condensed milk

Looking at the menu, there aren't a lot of choices but I like it when a restaurant chooses to focus on a few good dishes rather than have a large menu with several mediocre items. Plus, I'm not as familiar with Korean food so I wasn't feeling overwhelmed with a million choices. 

We opted to try to spicy pork with rice and the budae jjigae which was a spicy soup with a bunch of different types of toppings and noodles, I was nervous it would be really spicy but it wasn't nearly as spicy as it looked. Both dishes were fresh and flavourful. We really liked the side dishes, I think there were 6 of them which included some kimchi, potato salad, bean sprouts and some others. 

The service was really sincere and nice, everything came out quickly and they were quick to refill tea/water, etc...

A lot of people around us were having the table BBQ and I'd love to give that a try next time, it smelled amazing.

I will definitely return to this restaurant to try some other dishes!",2017-02-11 17:55:25

PT1oBoNvD6X1uHtCCx2FbQ,eRDWzHCldd6YXypRECvHYg,CKJnoUSWocdVIj6Fqbgm5g,4,3,3,3,"My friends and I arrived for our 7PM dinner and we were promptly shown to our table. Once our drink orders were taken, my friends and I discussed the menu and how we wanted to approach our dinner. I suggested that we each order an appetizer and a main, and share them - so that we can try as many of the menu items as possible. So that's what we did. We each ordered a different appetizer and main, and passed it around, with each one of us taking a small portion of each.

This is what we ordered...

Appetizers

BAKED LOBSTER & CRAB SOUP
GUMBO SAUSAGE & CHICKEN WITH CORN BREAD
FRIED & SMOKED ""JERK"" CHICKEN WINGS
CRISPY COCONUT SHRIMPS WITH THAI DIPPING SAUCE
CALAMARI

What we loved...

The lobster and crab soup was our absolute favorite! It was creamy and aromatic with lobster and crab flavors well infused into the broth. I also loved that it came with phyllo pastry baked over the bowl. It made the process of digging into the soup very dramatic and a bit of a spectacle.

Our 2nd favorite was the gumbo! It was rich, well-balanced with just the right amount of spice, and the cornbread, though not appealing to look at, was flaky and buttery. Yeah, noticing a pattern here; they know how to make soups! Which, I must say, I find pretty damn impressive since from my experience, infusing deep flavor into a soup is not an easy task!

Both the calamari and shrimp were tasty, but I was not a huge fan of the batter and the seasoning - I personally found the two a tad bland and overly battered.

What we did not love so much...

Our least favorite were the wings. Unlike the soups, the wings tasted like the seasoning and flavor was superficial, and not absorbed into the meat. The wings tasted bland and incomplete. I also felt that with a side of rice, the dish would have improved since they were bulky and awkward to eat on their own. But then again, if you add rice, then they are no longer a starter. Hmm

Mains

MUSHROOM AGNOLOTTI WITH MUSHROOM TRUFFLE BUTTER SAUCE
JALAPENO LINGUINE CHICKEN 'CALYPSO"" WITH MUSHROOMS, SUNDRIED TOMATOES, WHITE WINE JERK CREAM SAUCE
GARLIC SHRIMP ANGER HAIR PASTA MARINARA
MEATBALL GNOCCHI
PORK BELLY PIZZA (no longer on their menu)

What we loved...

The angel hair pasta with the garlic shrimps! Hands down the best main! The pasta was cooked to perfection - not soggy and not tough. The shrimps were plump and juicy, and the sauce was creamy and well-seasoned. To be honest, I hated having to share it. :(

My second favorite was the meatball gnocchi. The gnocchi was also cooked well (too often I find they are too soggy and cloggy-tasting) and the meatballs were placed on a delicious rich red tomato sauce that helped them stay nice and moist.

A dish that my friends really enjoyed but I didn't was the mushroom agnolotti. I love mushrooms, just not as a filling. That's just a personal preference, but that said, and to be fair, my friends really enjoyed this dish.

What we did not love so much...

Our least favorite pasta was the linguine with the jerk sauce. The jerk sauce just did not work for us. I am not sure I understand why this restaurant is so adamant about using jerk seasoning. It's not working! In fact, this was the only pasta dish we could not finish. Imagine a brown sauce meeting a cream sauce resulting in a brownish mess on top of pasta.  And then to your horror, the two hate each other and the poor pasta and chicken are the victims of this disaster. So very sad.

The other item we could not finish was the pizza. But there is no point discussing it since it's no longer on the menu, and if you read my earlier post on the pizza menu launch, you will see that I was never a fan of their pizzas to begin with.

Desserts

CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
CREME BRULEE
BREAD PUDDING

What we loved...

We loved all three desserts, but being a bread pudding lover, my expectations were set high! And they delivered! The bread pudding was not soggy, yet creamy, and not overly sweet. Good texture, and just the right amount of sweetness - score! Oh, and I can't forget the caramel sauce! Who does not love caramel?!

The creme brulee was creamy with a nice and crispy sugar-coating that we enjoyed cracking.

The chocolate mousse was rich and the combination of light and dark chocolate was a nice touch - not everyone loves dark bitter chocolate.

In sum...

My friends and I had a fantastic experience at The Red Tomato. For me in particular, I was relieved to see that they were able to overcome and repair my last experience there. The service was on-point, the food mostly did not disappoint - amazing bisque, gumbo, angel hair pasta, meatballs, and desserts - and the vibe was relaxing and friendly. For these reason I suggest you give them a try. Though I would stay away from any menu item with the word ""jerk"" in it.

P.S. I don't have anything against jerk spices. In fact, I love it! When done right.",2015-11-21 09:29:19

He rolled his eyes at me and asked me if I wanted something creamy or something like Italian ""cuz I don't wanna stand here and name them all."" Excuse me, is that not part of your job to tell patrons what their salad dressing choices are?! I didn't understand the big deal, especially after he eventually rattled off all the dressings in fewer than five seconds. The food was delivered quickly, which was impressive. Granted the restaurant was far from packed on the particular Wednesday we went for an early dinner. My second course was a chicken dish. It was supposed to be spicy, but was far from it. The portion size was decent, though. Rice, beans, salsa...All average taste, not spectacular by any means. My third course, the pumpkin flan, was delicious. I just wish the size of the flan they served me was doubled. So puny! Am I in a rush to get back here? No. Did I hate it?

I chose the huevos rancheros for brekkie, after I'd already enjoyed a half order of their beignets. The beignets were tasty (covered in powdered sugar) and still hot, but a little too hard for my taste. Not light at all. The eggs arrived shortly after. Properly cooked and with the usual black beans and spicy cheese and salsa, on top of two grilled tortillas. I found the tortillas to be way too hard from being grilled, so after fighting with them and a knife, I opted to slide them out and ignore them. The home fried potatoes mixed into the eggs and beans and salsa were excellent and I enjoyed the rest of my meal.

They aren't perfect but I do love the length and the rockstar color I picked!

One problem is that I wish the glitter was covering more of my nail rather than being able to see the gel color through it but whatever no biggie! My other problem though was the receptionist was trying to rush Joanne through my nails so another lady could get a manicure.

With the clapboard stating the best butter tarts in Toronto I figured this deserved a look-see.

Well after my family devoured these huge and delicious and buttery sweet tarts they proclaimed BEST BUTTER TARTS EVER!!!! They are naturally gooey and runny and there is no need to warm them up. They are that good. 

I also grabbed a filone of bread or a french stick as they also say and it came from Black Bird Baking. This was one of the best french loaves I had because to me it needs to be crisp and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.

Andrea brings her breads in as they are more of a pastry shop. I need to visit Black Bird myself when near Baldwin Street.

Too bad I am up in the suburbs because this place offers some really good stuff.

I also enjoyed a delicious organic fair trade coffee and they do sell some of the beans and artisinal products as well.

One thing i noticed on their business card that has some great food porn photography is that they also sell Streetcar Sandwiches...not sure what that is but I do plan to drop by next time I am downtown to check it out.

This place was crazy packed when we went, but I had some friends from Seattle in town that really wanted to have some and this is the closest one to take them. I wish we took them to the Sahara branch because it was a bit of a clusterfuck. I'm sure for first timers though, seeing the famous burger with so many people gathering is a impressive thing. I got one a few blocks from home and had so many of these that the group excitement doesn't hit me. 

Major kudos to the crew here as they churn out so many orders that these folks must be always tired after a shift.",2011-05-30 10:17:18

There was an uneven flame that kept shooting up whenever we took meat off of it, and the smoke was blowing into our faces.

Anyhow, I took some out of town friends here on St. Paddy's Day(including a yelper!) to grab a corned beef sammich. My fellow diners had a burger and the pierogi chicken paprikash. The pierogi was a huge hit. My sandwich, however, was somewhat lacking.
 It boasted a ""Jameson mustard sauce"" which did not appear on my entree. I let it go since there was commercial mustard at the table. I don't think they always make this dish and it was probably just for the holiday. The bread was store bought rye(Schwebel's maybe? I detected a hint of Akron flour). The beef was pretty bland. 

Again, I don't think it's fair to bash a special versus a staple the establishment is known for. Service was decent on a busy day, though the place was only half full. The people watching at about five pm on Detroit was priceless. We were seated right in the window. Many drunken revelers showing off for us like so many exhibitionist zoo gorillas. The booths are very cozy and tall, giving your dining party great privacy. I did order some mozz sticks and onion rings to go for my wife and they were excellent.

If you get a remodeled room they have a 42 inch flat screen tv and new beds and decor real nice. 

Also their parking is good and access is nice from the strip which i feel is very important in a casino. If you have ever been to Planet Hollywood casino you will know what i mean. no strip access with car  you must go to the back street and it's a million mile walk cause you have to go thru the shopping center. 

The only reason Paris does not get five stars is the fact that their gambling limits on tables have gone up and most all their restaurants are too pricey and not very good. Even the buffet is over priced and tasteless.  Only place worth trying is the French Pastry shop, ya its expensive but worth trying just once. They look like work of art.

I ordered it again, and it was completely different and awful. The food is only okay and not memorable. What is memorable is how the server refused to give us extra plates and silverware because she didn't want us to have a birthday cake someone brought. She claimed it was the law where birthday cakes cannot be served in the restaurant, but I've been to several restaurants where that is not the case. She claimed that we can't have birthday cake because if we get sick, then the restaurant will be to blame. We discovered she is mistaken, and that if you bring birthday cake and get sick, then you acknowledge you cannot blame the restaurant.

The service was fantastic.  Our server was quick, attentive, and very knowledgeable.   Our food came one item after the other with little to no waiting.  To start, the complimentary bread with olive oil/pesto sauce was delicious.  Then came the superbly prepared calamari appetizer.  It was truly one of the best calamari dishes I've ever eaten.  It was very full of flavor with just a touch of spiciness.  Order extra dipping sauce, though!  It's so flavorful that you're going to want more for the big pile of calamari they serve!

Next came our unnecessary house salads.  I say unnecessary because with so much other food, we could have skipped the salad, but it was refreshing after the fried calamari.  Plus, it was more than just lettuce greens.  It contained some pricey items like kalamata olives, hearts of palm, and pine nuts so you definitely got your money's worth for only $2.80 to add to an entree.  

Lastly was the entree.  I ordered the tuna steak -- rare -- with a chimichurri sauce (you can pick one of four sauces/flavors for your grilled fish).  It was so full of flavor.  We had made good choices all around.  Even the wine went down easy (although when doesn't it?).  Speaking of wine...they have a great, very reasonably priced wine list.

All in all, it was a great night out.  Bonefish offers a ""special night out"" feel, but not at the prices that you'd find at other seafood restaurants.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because Bonefish is a chain it's not good or not someplace to take a date or family visiting from out-of-town. It's truly worth it...and very affordable.

In a town that offers numerous juice bars, smoothies, and poke bowl options..it sets the bar high.

My sister and I dropped by for a late lunch/snack and each ordered an acai bowl.
Menu is fairly simple and easy to navigate, but we were not offered any help or explanation of what food/drinks were offered.  As a result, we later discovered other options for food/drink that we might've wanted to try instead. 

Seating: limited to a two-top table, small couch, and communal 5 seater table. Perhaps most people opt for to go orders?

Food: I ordered the C D Bowl- an acai bowl with mixed berries, bananas and granola. Bowl was served in a reusable dish with a plastic utensil. Portion is fair-small in comparison to other acai/pitaya bowls I've had. Overall flavor profile was average: I couldn't find anything in the bowl that would make me want to crave or re-order it in the future. The granola topping seemed to have some sort of flavored coating (strawberry? yogurt??) on it that clashed with the bowl's ingredients at times.

I had the fish in the Etobicoke location and it was bland.  I had the Caesar Salad in the US from the same menu and it was fantastic.,2016-09-06 05:03:22

Located in the beautiful Tivoli Village an outdoor patio can be found here and especially if you're here in the evening it's magical.  

I love a place that is nice but still allows families to feel at home.  Great kids menu and lovely genuine service! If you're sick of taking the kids to Chili's come here!

It was the sister's birthday so we came in and since we had been eating all day we settled for an appetizer and some salads.  My son had the salmon off the kids menu and I'm so happy they offered such tasty options and generous portions.  His salmon was grilled to perfection ( I wish I would have ordered it!) it was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes.

The desserts were to die for!  They served them in shot glasses and were reasonably priced and there was no guilt since they were small portions, but just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. The creamy concoctions were creme brulee, lemon cheesecake and a chocolate flavor-I think from what I can remember. But they were all fabulous!!! 

The bill for the four of us was only $42!

I get recognized at quite a few Starbucks, which can be viewed as both good and bad. My friend and I like to sit on the patio and soak up the sunshine and occasional exhaust  fumes from the adjacent drive thru. Her kid has plenty of room to play while we enjoy our beverages. The inside is clean and has a modern look. The staff are always friendly. I use my gold card to get an iced coffee, when I refill it on that same visit, it is free. For those that do not frequent Starbucks, if you get a hot brewed coffee, iced coffee or iced tea, your refill will only be 50 cents. The food selections are fresh. The wait time is minimal. I do not have to repeat my order over and over. Most importantly, when I redeem my reward beverage, they do not charge me. This is great because at every other Starbucks that I frequent, I get charged for an add-on to my drink and then it turns into an unpleasant experience for all involved. 
The location is easy to access and the parking is decent. 
The Pike was weak the last time I ordered it, so I just advised the barista and she resolved it with a smile.

- Prices: flat out excellent, to the point where I take more trips than I would have otherwise.  And you get a free checked bag - how unusual and awesome is that?!

- Service:  always both efficient and friendly (unlike other airlines, which can be hit or miss, especially staff at the gate), and also never under-staffed.  Sometimes, the flight staff can be hilarious!

- Planes: modern, clean and well-maintained (they've made huge improvements in this area since 2003).

- Record: more on time than any other airline I fly (usually early, in fact), and they're just generally very professional.  I've had to change my flight a few times and it's always been a breeze (and free).

- Bonus: they still serve peanuts, and these days, they usually have free TV/wifi on the flight, too.

- Seating:  The only downside, as we all know, is that you get a line assignment at check-in (which can't be done more than 24 hours before the flight).  You can end up in either A, B or C group, and each group has like 60 people.  Then you get in line and board the plane in order (A1-A60, followed by the Bs, etc), finding any open seat.  

Although it's definitely not as nice as having an assigned seat, I've never had a terrible seat.  I've flown with my husband and we've always gotten seats together with plenty of overhead bin space for our backpacks.  If you really hate it and don't mind paying a little extra, there are services that get you prime seat assignments.

All in all, a wonderful, professional, affordable airline that delivers what it promises.  Five stars, all the way!!",2015-01-21 02:44:38

I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki lunch box (lunch boxes are available from 11am-3pm) which came with meso soup, few maki rolls, rice, salad, and few pieces of fruits (check the photo below) teriyaki chicken tasted A-OK. My friend ordered Cali maki rolls and she let me try them, they were alright but I was expecting more of them considering the price. Tea is complimentary and they got free refills.

With the DJ's it's like eating in a nightclub. Everyone who comes here is gorgeous. 

I went to the first day of STK Brunch.  WOW!!!  pretty impressed.  They had a live cover band. She has a great voice.  Might be for the opening day but they also had a fortune teller.  

One little thing, they served my coffee in  to go cup. Didn't feel it suited the caliber of this restaurant.  They also forgot the baileys.  Their cinnamon bread is soooooooo delicious. Just as addicting as their dinner bread.  This one comes with an icing!  Had their yogurt and granola.  Plated nicely but tastes as good as what I could throw together at home.

We ordered a bowl of Tonkotsu shoyu ramen with an extra order of egg, kimchee fried rice, and gyoza. Let's actually start with the ramen which was the most disappointing dish of the 3....HOWEVER it was better than I expected. I have recently lost my hope for ramen so this place was actually better than I expected. The broth was a bit too salty for my taste but the chashu was really good. The noodles weren't bad. 

The gyoza was really good. It was crispy and the inside of it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The skin wasn't too thick so it had that perfect crispy to it when you bite into it. 

The Kimchee Fried rice was the shiitttt. No joke. I think I'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee fried rice to be honest. It was moist and tasty. So much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. There are restaurants that makes it super dry but Monta made it perfectly. Obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. It was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. We ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.

I would seriously come back only to get the fried rice...I'm really curious about the takana fried rice too. Service was actually really good and I actually gave Monta a 4 just because of the fried rice...or else I would probably give it a two stars. 

The lesson is...you come early to avoid the wait, you get the fried rice, and be happy with life.",2014-01-21 07:37:15

Our a/c tech, Jerome, arrived on time the very next morning. He was courteous, polite, and PUT ON BOOTIES OVER HIS SHOES without me having to ask! That impressed me the most. 

Jerome came in and asked more about the issue then climbed up in our attic to take a look. He took lots of photos and showed me what was going on (lots of dust in a part of the unit). He said it's a good idea to get your ducts cleaned but he didn't think we needed to spend the money on that yet. In fact, he did not suggest ANY unnecessary repairs and was very honest and straightforward. 

Thanks to a Yelp deal, I saved some cash and a new part, including TWO home visits for the repair, only took about $300 out of my pocket. Not bad, and now our central a/c is blowing the coldest air it has ever put out in over 8 years.

A good friend was out of town for all my birthday celebrations and brought me here as a make up date. (After this experience... I'm okay with Rich missing my birthday every year if it means he will take me here)

First off.... the hostess gave me a birthday card when she took us to our table. It was signed by a bunch of the waitstaff. Plus, at the end of the night our server gave me a box of chocolate covered strawberries to take home. Happy birthday to me. Wow, that is some fantastic service all the way around.

What do you need to know before a night at the Pot? It is a process. So allow yourself two-three hours for dinner. Come hungry. Really hungry. Maybe the hungriest you've ever been in your life. We went with the four course experience

Cheese: The special. Bourbon Bacon Cheddar. Holy.

Salad: California. Gorgonzola cheese and raspberry vinaigrette make everything better.

Entree: We went with Coq Au Vin... delicious. I want to try the Mojo next time. I did land and sea, but was mad that I didn't go with the classic. Luckily, Rich shared some of his with me. I love all the sauces they give you. I'm a sauce whore.

Dessert: I'm about to explode. I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the choices.. they all sound amazing. I picked flaming turtle... basically so we could also get a table-side fire show.

Drinks: there were martini specials. The strawberry blonde was very refreshing. The salted caramel was absolutely delicious. I also got a boozy cappuccino to go with my dessert. It came complete with a rock sugar candy stick to use as a stirry thing.

I could barely drive home because I was so full. I thought about sleeping in my car. It was all delicious. I think it would be great to go here and just skip out on the entree portion of the evening all together and just do cheese and dessert. That may be my plan next time.

Crisp is a decent place, but there are a few things that would convince me to give it an extra star or two:
-Need more variety of toppings and lettuce.  The toppings they have are good and fresh, but there aren't very many choices.  Would also love to have some kale!
-Speed up the service a bit.  I don't expect fast food speeds, but sometimes it takes a good 15-20 minutes to wait in line to order a salad.

I wait for a while and make eye contact with other employees and nobody acknowledges that there are customers.

The inside restaurant I would say is beautiful and has nice ceiling decorations.. very high and fancy with the long drapes above. Hosts are nice and friendly. ambiance of place is casual but also a upscale feel to it. Pricing isn't too bad as well. 

So the last time i was there I ordered a risotto dish with lobster on top!  the presentation of the dish was amazing!! beautifully done ...I adjusted some ingredients on there and they accommodated it all. I also had the crab cakes and it was delishh! the creme brûlée was yummy as well! Service by the waiter ..hmm he just doesn't seem interested in serving us. 

Another time I came here I ordered a Alfredo pasta with blackened shrimp on the side.. the shrimps were good. BUT the pasta they gave me was DRYER than the desert! I had to wave down the waiter help to ask him for extra alfredo sauce... which he called a manager over and he had it sent out shortly after. Manager was quite accommodating and nice. The waitress we had was OK i suppose but hardly around for service.. we literally would flag down anyone we saw walking by... 

Overall what i would say about this restaurant is that the ambiance is nice.. if I'm in the area i would def come back. Food is tasty for the most part.. but service is something I have never been fond of!! hopefully management or corporate can see the review and make sure that the waitstaff IMPROVE on the level of SERVICE they provide for every customer that comes into the place.

Heading to the restaurant, we sat in construction traffic on the Liberty Bridge forever.  Needless to say we were nearly twenty-five minutes late for our reservation.  To our pleasant surprise, Toast! had held the table and we were promptly seated. 

After being shown our table, we were brought bread.  I never knew that I could get excited over bread.  The crust had an awesome rosemary flavor with a large helping of salt thrown in.  (In all honesty, I'd be able to live off a salt lick).  The whipped butter enhanced the above ingredients with a creamy sweetness while also dialing back what some would consider an overly salty start to the dining experience.

For a starter, we had fried oysters - goodness on a plate.  They were not heavy with batter at all.  A distinct lemon citrus taste made the oysters pop on your taste buds.  I would eat several servings of these in a heartbeat.  We tried both soups on the menu:  potato chowder and cream of corn.  The chowder was thick almost like a puree.  A potato peel in every fourth bite or so added an unexpected texture contrast that was perfect, while the bacon added crunch and smoke flavor.  The cream of corn was a rich, down home soup.  It was not heavy like many cream soups can be.  The sweetness of the local corn really elevated the serving.  The soup was sparsely topped with a peach salsa - a touch more would have been welcomed.

The entrees were first class as well.  We had the ""Fish Duo"" (swordfish and shark) and ""Rock Shrimp Over Risotto"".  Once again the flavors made us smile.

Wait time for soups and desserts seemed a bit long.  Portion size of the soup and entrée was tiny.  It was more like a tapa - at an entrée price.  While I appreciate the outstanding cooking and attention to detailed presentation, I also want to leave feeling satisfied/full.",2011-08-28 14:27:33

I had always wondered how painful it would be to have a Brazilian waxing as part of what people term ""manscaping."" I have tried other methods that seem to last a month before the area returns to a hairy state.

Its difficult to find a spa or salon that performs this service for guys and to find reviews by guys who've had this service done & are willing to talk about it. Apparently manliness comes into question when one submits to having one's pubes ripped from their body.

Anyhow I first went to Yelp where I was able to get an idea of where to start looking. Ladies are the primary source of information for this service & in the end I spoke with a close friend who works at Re Salon to see if men could get a Brazilian there. As it turned out the service was available for guys & gals. So I booked an appointment & went down to meet my fate.

Re Salon is housed within an old fire house on South Boulevard in front of the Arlington Tower. (The pink glass building.) My specialist was a lady named Elizabeth. The spa part is upstairs but you check in downstairs at a desk on your left. The salon takes up the bottom floor. I was led upstairs and sat in a small waiting area at the top of the stairs. I was quite a bit early for my appointment due to my own nature partly and my nervousness at what would take place. 

Elizabeth came out & introduced herself & led me to a room where I removed my pants and briefs and lay on my back on a table. I had a towel covering my groin. She talked a bit about the service & what it entailed. Apparently the wax's color, blue, meant that it was a newer formulation making it easier to grab & pull away hair.
I asked her if she had a lot of male clients and she said she had a few every month. She said that they mainly came in to settle bets of manliness made under alcoholic boasting between friends.

Okay, so what you really want to know is was it painful? Yes its painful. The less hair the less pain, but some areas are going to be painful no matter what the length of the hair is. The nice thing is that Elizabeth makes you feel comfortable & instructs you how to breathe... In through your nose & out through your mouth as the wax is suddenly removed from your body. I would say that 90% of the treatment has a pain level I would peg as annoying. The few times that I actually made an O face the pain was intense but very short lived. The entire service was over and done with in 15 minutes.

 I had my waxing in the middle of May and I still don't need another appointment. I think now its been 6 weeks. I think that Re Salon & Spa has a very comfortable atmosphere with wonderful people staffing it. Everyone is friendly & they make you feel at home. The waxing is quick & efficient & Elizabeth is very personable & professional. Definitely ask for her. I'd like to try some of their other services when I get a chance and I'm looking forward to a return visit.",2012-06-28 14:33:34

I love Vons!  I am always happy with the produce section and the quality of the items are always very good.  I use a lot of veggies for salads and grilled vegetables.  In the summertime, I love to take a whole sweet onion (like a Maui or Vidalia) and cut into rings and grill them.  Grilling the onion brings out the sweetness of it and it tastes wonderful on a burger or mixed with other veggies.  I bring a lot of fresh fruit to work or on my way to the gym.  

My only suggestion would be to make the plastic bags in the produce section easier to locate.  I am not the only one who is having trouble finding them.  While I was looking, I saw another customer looking for the bags as well.  The produce area is appealing the way it is arranged.  I would just like to see it be more user friendly.

I found some interesting bread on this last visit called Ezekiel 4:9 bread.  It uses no four, has a low glycemic index and uses sprouted grains.  I ate a piece with my breakfast today and it was very good.  It's a very interesting product.  The store stocks four varieties of this bread like Seasame, Cinnamon, Regular and 7 Sprouted.

WdVtYIjocBwaZIA5uHEYJg,qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,3,1,0,0,"Thought we give this place a try when we saw a billboard while on the fwy and due to it being known on food network (per billboard). Cant go wrong, right? There wasn't a whole lot of people (4 tables filled), good is we will get our seats and food quicker! 

When we first saw the menu, all our eyes enlarged and almost wanted to walk out of there! I have never seen pho (off the strip) SO costly before. I mean unless your eating inside a fancy upscaled Bellagio hotel venue, almost $15 for pho is ALOT. (minus 1-star)

With the 100F+ weather and hungry guys at our table, they don't want to find another place. So my other thought was, this better be good and worth it. Well, its not anywhere that you can find an oxtail pho as most have the traditional way, I do have to say this was some darn good soup! My husband loves soup and usually drink most of it, but rarely does he finish out the bowl. He sure did here. The lady who served us (i think she is the owner) was very proud of her soup and even said, ""glad you like our soup!"" He responded, I always drink the soup because I love soup. She was confidence to respond, ""Well I think its just here that you finish all the soup otherwise there is something wrong with your taste buds because we have the best soup."" The noodles are the thicker/wider ones than the traditional thin ones as well but not too big of a deal.

I ordered a vermicelli noodle (aka Bun) with egg rolls and grilled beef. This I can say, it was meh. Not bad but not the greatest. This I wouldn't pay again for as again its costly. (minus 1-star)

At first I have to say, the lady seemed very rude and rushy which I didn't like. Give and take I do have to say she was the only one working at that time. Attitude of the typical Asian but not like she was mad because throughout the meal, she talked more and had a good sense of humor, i guess. Again, knowing my husbands motto who believes in quality/flavor vs quantity with lower prices, he said he will come back just for the oxtail pho soup. 

Overall, if we were to come back, just go for their soup or shall I say oxtail soup which is different here and not anywhere else I know of has it. So for this, it may be worth it. Everything else, too expensive and you can get anywhere else.",2015-06-25 20:49:13

We arrive at Magic Noodle 大槐树 for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed with quite a wait but the service and turn over time was pretty quick. We got our table within 15 minutes which was very acceptable in my opinion.

Cold Flavored Assorted Vegetables $3.25
~ We saw most table ordering this and decided to give it a try. 
~ It was just slightly pickled veggies which was sweet and slightly tangy which was a perfect side to the noodles.

Sliced Pork Foot in Soy Sauce $4.99
~ Another cold dish but I have to say that I'm a bit bias on this since I like mine hot and melt in your mouth version but cold ones are more ""al-dente""/springy in texture. ~ But this was very flavorful and Ben did love it.

Sizzling Tofu $1.50
~ Not sure why it's called sizzling but it was just your typycal Chinese BBQ skewers (they have a few meat options). 
~ Love the sweet sauce here together with the typical Chinese skewer dry rub mix.

  All the noodles are made fresh constantly where you could see the process through their open kitchen which they didn't allow me to video or take picture thou 
They have 2 types of noodle here, the regular hand-pulled ones (Lamian 拉麵) and the hand cut noodle which is where they hold a large piece of dough and slice it with a special cutter over boiling water/broth.

Hand Pulled Noodle with Beef - Small $6.99 Large $7.99
~ We decided to go with the most basic one since it's our first time here and it was amazing with perfectly cook noodles, pho like soup and tender slices of beef. Just like pasta, you can definitely taste the difference of fresh hand-pulled noodles.

 Sliced Noodle with Traditional Braised Pork - Small $6.99 Large $7.99
~ The sliced noodle are thicker and here doughier (almost like rice cake) which I love while Ben prefers the noodle. 
~ This one didn't have soup but was tossed in the braising liquid instead which can end up being rather oily for some people but I do find it perfect with the thicker noodle while I can't imagine it with a soup which may end up being rather bland for this.
~  And let's not forget about the pork which was packed of flavors of soy sauce, spices like anise and  cloves.

Fried Pancake with Leek $2.99
~ Made fresh and served pipping hot, this was perfect for these cold winter days with the perfect crisp exterior to the moist filling of leeks, egg and bit of vermicelli.

Verdict :
~ Love everything and will definitely be back real soon, maybe for take out to avoid the the crowd.
~ Super affordable, authentic and delicious
~ Perfect for our stay-uptown weekend
~ Service are almost non-existent just like most Chinese eateries but here they expect a 10% or less tips

Like many Yelpers have noted, this place is pretty hipster. The decor is beautiful; it's got a quite mysterious yet relaxing feel to it. However, it was a lot smaller than I had expected. I believe there's only 4 small tables and a long one with tall stools near the window and that's about it. 

We ordered the Sweet Dew Oolong, Royal Milk Tea and Apple of My Eye as many Yelpers have recommended. 

- Sweet Dew Oolong: From the sounds of it, I thought it was Oolong tea mixed with Honey dew however, that was not the case. Prior to ordering, they allow you to get a scent of what this drink might taste like. After smelling these herbs in a tiny jar, it had a funky scent at first - kind of sour with a strong Oolong scent however, upon tasting the drink it didn't taste like that at all. I don't like my drinks too sweet so, I ordered it with less sugar and also less ice. I found nothing really special about this drink. It literally tasted like Oolong tea with ice. It was however, refreshing on a hot summer day and I didn't really mind iit. If you prefer your drink on the sweeter side then definitely order it with regular sugar level.

- Royal Milk Tea: I tried a sip from my friend and there was definitely a hint of blueberry flavour at the end. Again, nothing really outstanding about the milk tea aside from the blueberry aftertaste. The tea taste is definitely not as strong compared to Chatime's and the blueberry aftertaste kind of threw me off. Not sure if I like my milk tea tasting fruity...

- Apple of My Eye: Again, tried a sip from my friend and this is probably my favourite one out of the three. Very refreshing! It reminds me of an apple's Somersby. Love the aloe and toppings in it.

So, now that my little beef (erm, pardon the pun) is outta the way, I must say that I very much enjoy the inventory of TJ's.  First and foremost, I never leave here without restocking the $3 buck Chuck - Shiraz and Cab for mid-week meals when you don't feel like busting out the $15-$25 dollar vino.  The rest of the wine selection is surprisingly so-so and seems to have faltered in the last few years.  A once proud beer selection (and they allow you to mix-n-match sixers) has also decreased in quality, though they DO stock a nifty amount of Oak Creek Brews, which any proud Arizonan will stock up on without nary a glance at the Guinness or what have you.

The produce is not as expensive as the organic section of Safeway, so its a good place to stock up on a few extra 'healthier' (*cough*) veggies (my fiancee thinks so, anyway) at no extra charge.  Their meat selection is pretty decent for a store whose clientele are poster-children for the PETA Militia. 

TJ's is a nice place to supplement you grocery stash, but I just don't think I could do 100% of my shopping here -- and this from someone who eats-in very healthily about 95% of the week.  We have staples here that we almost always pick up -- that wine I mentioned before, edamame, veggies, a variety of fish, beer, and a couple of snacks like popcorn or cookies -- but that's primarily it for TJ's.

Menu options you'll find everything from sushi to green and red curry, sort of thai-japanese and other asian blend. Nothing too authentic but I order the green curry and found it had the right balance of sweet and spicy. It was chalk full of veggies too onion, lemongrass, mushroom, green and red bell pepper. So I would say it was about two large portions of food, or three small ones.

Very generous portions for the price, the drink menu was a little more pricey. I tried the pear sake and it was delicious! Even if you're not a sake lover you can order small amounts and test it out with a friend. I have tried apple, and peach flavored sake this was by the best.

Cozy and modern on the inside and while it seems small when you get in, there is another side of the cafe just around the corner. Like any old cafe, it's self-seating and you order from from the till and are given a number. It wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon and while there was spots on the bar, we waited a few minutes and some tables became available. I love the marble countertops and fresh flowers that are at every table. 

They have a selection of pastries, coffee and, of course, a pretty good menu to choose from. I was particularly peck-ish that morning and got half of the turkey brie sandwich as well as the butternut squash soup and side salad. For it being only half a sandwich, it was a pretty decent size! It came with a cherry jam and trust me a little goes a long way. The sandwich itself was alright but it was obvious that it was prepared much earlier in the day. The butternut squash soup was delicious and I could've definitely eaten more of it and the piece of focaccia bread it came with was soft and perfectly toasted. The mixed green salad was standard and had a touch too much dressing, but overall it was fine. My girlfriend got the croque monsieur and butternut squash soup and she also agreed that the soup was delicious.

Saturday nights are great for dancing. We always check their website to see who the DJ is, as they have a rotating schedule. Nestless Eggs is one of our favorite nights there. It's a departure from the annoying Top 40 stuff you hear in other bars. Any place that plays Robyn immediately wins me over!

Drinks are reasonably priced, and the regular bartender on the second floor is awesome and friendly. The bar itself is essentially an old house, and the upstairs is still divided into rooms with old woodwork and fireplace mantles. Definitely an interesting feel to this place, almost like a house party.

I went with two other friends for dinner Friday night and were promptly seated in the room. We were given a teapot and a jug of water. We ordered a plate of tangsooyuk and jampong (the seasonal special that's on during the summer). 

The tangsooyuk was a good starter - fluffy with covered in a sweet sauce. I wasn't expecting much SK I was pleasantly surprised. The jampong was amazing. The flavour is lot more intense than the average bowl; it had more spices and more depth in the broth. Be warned though - it is very spicy! We went through two jugs of water.

First, its easy to fill yourself up on the complimentary chips and salsa bar. There are at least 10 different salsas plus bean dip and mole for you to enjoy. All the salsas are freshly made and each has a distinct flavor. Second, the prices on the entrees are really unbeatable for nicer casual Mexican places. Third, the food portions are huge! Considering the free chips and salsa, its really easy to get two meals out of one entree. Fourth, the  food quality is great! Everything tastes fresh and is very flavorful, which is definitely contrary to the many bland dishes you can find at other restaurants.

I was looking at the shop signs and headed towards the Salad King sign, but then someone called out and said I already passed the entrance. Oops.

Eating at salad king feels like eating at a cafeteria. Everyone's sitting on large tables arranged in rows, with strangers beside you. Well, that's if you're seated at that half of the restaurant. The other half of the restaurant feels like you're in a cafe. It's quite a design really.

Apparently there are some off-menu items, but I just went with what's on the menu.
What you'll notice is that prices are cheaper than some other thai places like sukho or KSR or pai. Perhaps this is catered towards a student budget, given that they offer 20% off for ryerson students.

I ordered the thai noodle soup. It felt like eating pho given that it uses similar ingredients, but I found that with 5-chilis it wasn't all that spicy. Perhaps because it is a soup item, or maybe 5 isn't really that spicy. There wasn't much flavour in the noodles though, which is unfortunate.

Takoyaki
Kushi moriwase (assorted skewers)
Chicken skin, heart, stomach, & scallop kushi
Uni shooter with gold leaves
Tonkatsu ramen
Cheese okonomiyaki
Salmon teriyaki

My favourites were the more exotic items on the kushi menu listed above and the uni shooter. The tonkatsu ramen is a generous portion that will fill you up as a last item to your meal and help dilute some of that sake or sapporo that was enjoyed earlier in the meal.

~ Best presentation ever, pictures of this dish online everywhere was what attracted me to this place.
~ Give it a handshake and pull it off before biting into the moist, juicy and well seasoned chicken with the extra crispy coatings. 
~ Love how the hot sauce is served on the side so that the skin or bun doesn't get soggy, although the chicken is very flavorful the sauce is very much needed.

  Johnny Cake w/ Smoked Trout $14
~ cornmeal Griddle Cake w/ Savoury Cream,
~ A Rhode Island staple, this was new to me and I'm not sure I really like it. I usually love sweet and savory combination but somehow I don't like this version... somehow, it's too sweet and not salty enough, the maple syrup drenched griddle cake took over the smoked trout flavor. 
~ We end up just eating the smoked trout with the savory cream.

  Bones in a Bucket $18
~ Kansas City Rubbed Beef and Pork Ribs, Ranch Dressing, Celery, Carrot
~ This was fall off the bone good with a thick coating of sauce, it was one of the best beef ribs.


 Would have love to try their desserts and some of the cocktails but it was so hot that we lost appetite.

 Verdict :
~ Love it here but with it wasn't so hot, will hopefully go back when it's colder.
~ Love the decor, the service and the atmosphere",2013-09-06 02:24:45

This is Fast Food.  Doubt if there's anything healthy here so don't look for it.  This is simple yet delicious comfort food that is cooked well and tastes great.  Never realized how unique this type of place was until I started travelling.

Realizing that even the bar area is pretty full, he didn't miss a beat on full service to ALL.  I ordered a prime rib, dry rubbed in spices, well done that was simply exquisite.

derFKK0wk1yw9j1yuLjNzA,9pNcdrQLWWrX0vEGGJlEbg,iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ,3,4,1,1,"I've never heard of Backyard Taco.  We literally saw it on the left side of the street as we were driving through Gilbert so we decided to stop.  Immediately upon walking in we noticed there was nowhere to sit inside.  It was a pretty packed house.  We skimmed the menu a bit and noticed a picture of a ""Stuffed"" steak quesadilla scroll across the screen so we decided to go with a Cheese Quesadilla and a Steak/Carne Asada Quesadilla. 

It didn't take long for our order to arrive. While we waited we made our way to the condiment station.  I grabbed the pickled onions, cucumbers and guacamole salsa. I was about to grab a bit of the hot salsa when a lady warned me that it was really hot!  I tried a little, and she was right!  It was too hot for me.  My boyfriend thought it was fine. 

Once we received our food, we sat outside because again it was packed inside, nowhere to sit at all.  I was disappointed in the presentation and quality of the food.  For starters, my ""stuffed"" steak quesadilla wasn't stuffed at all, nor was it folded and grilled shut.  It wasn't a quesadilla in fact, it was a steak taco but bigger.  I brought this to the worker's attention and she said this is how our quesadillas are.  Mine had nothing but chewy, cold steak and onions.  (See enclosed picture).  My boyfriend's cheese quesadilla looked more like a children's food menu item but he said it was tasty. Because I've personally heard good things about this place from co-workers and friends, I'd like to try it again.  I'll stick with street tacos next time.  

Before writing this review I checked out the website and menu online.  The minute the page loads up you see a picture of a delicious looking, stuffed quesadilla.  Just like the item I ""thought"" I was orderly.  They should really change the pictures of the food items because it's so deceiving.",2018-03-26 18:51:04

We ordered the takoyaki and edamame special for $8.50 and also a sushi rolls platter. Overall, the sushi was pretty good, they even add a bit of mayo into the tempura shrimp roll giving it more taste than other Japanese restaurants. This restaurant offers bento boxes and a build your own bento for $20. So you are definitely looking at OSAKA prices (the restaurant down the street). For the pieces of fish we ordered, they were generally fresh, BUT they serve the sushi with soya sauce that is NOT Japanese. The saltiness of their soya sauce made their sushi less tasteful and VERY salty. I could see myself coming back, but bringing my own soya sauce. I hope they see this review and consider swapping their sauces out to Japanese sushi soya sauce. It really does make a difference, especially if I am going to pay over $20 per person.

First impression was the really cool and unique design elements that went in to creating the dining space.  Very different from any other Vegas foodie find. The bathrooms were also done up very differently with rustic elements of unfinished copper and finely polished wood.  The staff immediately greeted us as we entered.  We looked over the menu which had the appearance of ""farm to table"" approach to dining with hints of organic and locally sourced ingredients.  

Ordering at the counter is the routine.  All the whileyou are being tempted by the fresh pastries staring at you from behind the glass partition.  One day I will conquer you but for now it was time for breakfast.  I prefer savory over sweet 99% of the time fro breakfast and i was not going to changed that now no matter how tempting.  

Coffee and cappuccino to start everyone off.  The coffee was nice and strong and the cappuccino was almost too beautiful to drink with the heart pattern floating on the top.  Nice touch.  Our group ordered the Skillet breakfast with bratwurst, french toast, and a waffle.  The dishes came out in a timely manner.  My skillet breakfast was a little small and the bratwurst was overcooked slightly.  Almost like it was cooked prior and left to settle in a hot well.  The dish also lacked salt which is an easy fix of course but when you are preparing high quality food the chef should be able to incorporate all flavors effectively.  
The waffle was very light and crisp.  However the syrup it came with was very spicy.  I am not sure if it had way to much nutmeg or what but after consuming a taste it almost burned like a cayanne pepper. We brought it to there attention while leaving so they could clear up the issue.  French toast had good flavor but was slightly under cooked in some sections making it mushy.  

At the time of this meal Publicus was a month in to there ""soft opening phase"".  I really welcome a great place like this to the DTLV community.  The large table seating is great for conversation starting.  Why not talk to complete strangers?  During this trip, kitchen execution had not been perfected but I am sure they will get there soon.  I look forward to giving Publicus another shot and hope they pull off their earthy recipes flawlessly.  Good Luck! and Welcome to the neighborhood.",2015-04-30 03:25:57

Centrifuge sits on the casino floor right across from the entrance to Studio 54.  Pretty good location and at least for the duration I was there (weekday), the crowd was a mixed crowd with young and old.  They have nice booths and tables you can sit at and if you can get a table or a booth, it's a great place to people watch, either at the people in the bar or people out at the casino floors.  Vegas never fails to produce some interesting people haha.

Bartenders here are great.  Talkative, nice, and make fairly strong drinks.  Prices are average for Vegas, which is nothing to be surprised about.  They have about 5 beers on tap with a nice selection for the bottles.  One bartender even gave us a beer each on the house even though we've only been sitting there chilling with our beer.  Needless to say we gave him a nice tip in the end.  

One fun thing is that when certain songs are played, all the bartenders and wait staff will get up on the bar table and dance.  Even though they aren't that great, it's entertaining nonetheless!

At first glance it would be hard to spot Kabuto, because there are no signs for it at all. The only thing you can distinguish the place is the slim window. But it is in the same plaza as Monta Ramen and Raku.
Definitely take the time to reserve ahead of time if you plan to eat here, as their restaurant is small and limited. The restaurant itself is quaint, and simple. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the chefs make your sushi, they are very friendly and know what they are doing.
The servers are amazing here! Highly attentive and informative. When your food came, they would explain what you were eating and its place of origin. I must also mention that all of their fish is FRESH! Fresh shipments from the shores of Japan, Korea,Brazil, and a few other places. Expect great quality!
Now mind you it costs a pretty penny to dine here, so don't expect huge portions. Its more of a place to take your time and enjoy the flavor of each piece of Edomae Sushi.
Another thing to note is this place serves Edomae Sushi and fish. No rolls. If you expect rolls, you're better off going to a AYCE place.

Calamari and shrimp mango salad, the shrimps were perfectly made, very juicy and flavourful;
Short ribs with Caramelized onions was my favourite, tender ribs covered in thick dark sweet onion sauce but with a bit of bitterness;

Arctic char ceviche with green apple and ginger, the apple added a nice fresh taste to it;

They're slow to take orders and not good at bringing water, napkins, etc.

Here's an egregious example from my most recent visit. I ordered the yakisoba and an onigiri. They brought out the yakisoba, then a couple minutes later gave the onigiri to the guy beside me. (We were 2 of about 8-10 people in the restaurant and were seated right next to each other). I saw it there and saw him poke it a couple times before they came back to him and asked if he had ordered it. He said no. They asked if they could charge him for it. (!!!!!!!) He said yes. A few minutes later, they brought me an onigiri.

Their reaction during all of this was to tell me nothing. They literally never said anything, just brought me an onigiri that was like 10 minutes delayed because of their mess-up. It was kind of gross. No adjustments to my bill, obviously.

This is just one example. I still remember going here with a family member right as they were getting off of lunch break - which they eat at a table by the cash, without closing the door or putting up a sign or anything - and being told that we MIGHT have to leave or wait until they finished.

Medium - 5.3oz

XXL - 16oz
XXXL - 24oz

If you prefer turkey or veggie burgers they have them too!
You can also choose from chicken strips, hot dogs, and salads.
They have ""fat"" and ""skinny"" fries.

As soon as we arrived and told a young hostess we wanted a table for 7 problems arose. My recollection was she said they don't seat parties of our size because they don't have the right table for us (put two 4-top tables together honey...geez). We agreed to be separated as 3 & 4 top tables but the hostess decided to seat people behind us who aren't t even CHAIRMAN first (3 groups to be exact); they were regular folk like us. It's possible the ropes to separate VIP guests and regular guests were demented, it made no sense till after we finished our meals.  I assume the more polished hostess, who just started her shift, fixed it and arranged the ropes wisely.


Anyway, a second hostess finally seated us (separately). i asked her why we couldn't be seated in a section where the tables were open; she replied that the section was close.  Wow!!! So you're telling me if a group of 20 walked in with money to burn you wouldn't  seat them because the section is closed. It's not like the section or tables were reserved, just that no server was assigned that area. GET A SERVER TO TAKE THE TABLE MANAGEMENT!  Where were you guys anyways?

Ten minutes after being seated I kind of took it out on our server, Debra, with a grumpy and sad attitude for our mishaps. It did take quite some time for us to be greeted at the table or get a glass of water, but I shouldn't have because she was a pretty decent person and server.  Debra asked how we were and I replied truthfully and said not so well. We told her the story and her reaction was what I'd expect most people in the industry to react...shocked.  I jokingly asked her not to do anything funny to my food (it really does happen people, I worked in restaurants; I'm not saying it happens here but just saying, you never know). Never complain about staff until after your meal arrives; God forbid you ever have to return anything to a closed kitchen.  Debra was a good sport though and a good server; she directed us to the manager-on-duty Kim a little later.

Meanwhile....
Right next to us, they were putting two tables together to seat 7 people. WHAT THE HELL! REALLY...Yup, slap #1 on us.  We told Kim about it and she was amazed that happened too.  We just gave constructive feedback for her to tell the hostess. She said she was going to give us a discount or dessert for what happened but that never really happened so I'll leave my criticism of Kim with a BIG FAT QUESTION MARK; who knows if she will even train the hostesses correctly and let them know of their poor performance. Besides, we don't care about freebies, although they're nice.  Just fix what needs fixing, please!  Anyhow, the 7 people that sat next to us were a perfect White American family so i had to ask if there was something wrong with us (you know, being minorities and all), at least she answered wisely.  It does bring about good questions about the incident though. Hmmmm....

My food finally came.  NY steak and eggs (MR, OE, S). The sourdough toast wasn't toasted; my steak was rare and just seared outside, and my eggs were over-medium.  Food was just OK; I wonder if they rushed it or the chef got annoyed with the hurry order. I wonder if they.....?

Meanwhile...
That closed section, miraculously opened. They sat 4 next to us there (slap #2) and 15 minutes later they setup for a 6-top in that same closed section a few tables over (slap #3).  OMG! It had to be us. Who knows, don't care!  This place bites.  I doubt it will ever get better.

The Nimbus one was very light and fluffy and the HK Milk Tea one tasted exactly like HK milk tea, down to the tea flavour and creaminess that I love. The only downside was that the HK Milk Tea macaron was hard when I had it, but I suspect that had to do with the fact that I was out in the cold for a long time so it possibly froze/hardened.

I believe this was their first time doing this event. It was a great idea, whoever came out with the idea of using the space during off season. 

We came here on Tuesday night so it was not that busy. No lines, which was awesome. Plenty of parking in front of the park. We purchased tickets in advance (recommended). Price was $12, ($8 for season pass holder), kids 2 years and under was free. Most of attractions inside were included (except paint ball and trick 'n treat). It was a great deal since pumpkin patch usually cost more than that. They had face paintings, giant slide (FUN!!), rock climbing, haunted house (for younger kids, not so scary), train ride, bounce house, etc. They had a corner section for haunted dancing (DJ on the weekend). 

They also had a trick 'n treat section but you'd have to pay extra $5 for it. We did not do it since it was a school night and pretty late by then. 

If you happen to stop by and craving some carnival food, don't forget to tried their amazing and delicious funnel cake with cinnamon pumpkin ice cream! Oooooh, I was not a fan of cinnamon pumpkin until I tried this desert! I need to come back again just for this! I saw they had Hawaiian Shaved Ice but did not try it.

I know that I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain restaurant.  Yadda, Yadda, Yadda!  However, any restaurant that offers food at certain higher price points should deliver food that taste better their fast food/casual dining counterparts.  Thus, my dilemma after a recent visit to McCormicks and Schmicks .

This wasn't my first time at the rodeo.  Generally speaking, I love all things seafood.  (Sea squirts and things of that ilk, I'll leave to Andrew Zimmern)  But shrimp, crab, lobster and catfish are some of my personal faves.  I know that this sounds greedy for just three people, but we ordered the Shrimp Kisses, Coconut Shrimp, Fried Stuffed Mushrooms appetizers; Buttermilk Fried Shrimp, Cashew Crusted Tilapia with Jamaican Rum Butter and Shrimp and Andouille ""Mac & Cheese"" for entrees on this particular occasion.  The Shrimp Kisses and Fried Stuffed Mushrooms were tasty.  However, the Coconut Shrimp and Buttermilk Fried Shrimp had batters that were too heavy and somewhat rubbery.  During other visits, the Buttermilk Fried Shrimp had a much lighter crust.  Who knows what was going on in the kitchen that day? 
 
I say this because my daughter Muff ordered the Shrimp and Andouille ""Mac & Cheese"" for an entrée and it was served sans the shrimp and Andouille sausage.  Once we pointed this out to our server, she said that that was kid's Mac & Cheese and a kid received the Shrimp and Andouille ""Mac & Cheese"".  The Cashew Crusted Tilapia with Jamaican Rum Butter was also tasty.  Our server also vacillated between being very attentive and missing in action...

Okay...   So, I don't know if this was an off day or what... But inconsistent food quality, inconsistent service, inconsistent food preparation can kill a restaurant.  All of the McCormicks and Schmicks that I have been to have had a nice ""clubby"" feel and that's perfectly fine.  But, the food and service really need to be tightened up a little and the menu should probably be updated.

Better quality everything should be expected at the prices that they charge.  All I could think about was Donna Summer's ""She Works Hard For the Money"" lyric that says ""So you better treat her right!"".  I didn't get ""right"" treatment and I work hard for my money!.",2015-02-25 16:05:01

The fries were good.  The chili was good but they were a bit stingy.  The thing that ruined it for me was that they used the fake velveeta cheese, the kind that never solidifies.  Oh Red Hot Lovers!  I miss you!

As for their sandwiches, I liked the fries and coleslaw combination.  Hot salty fries with cool vinegary coleslaw.  Yum.  However, given the ratio of fries (huge) compared to coleslaw and sandwich filling (pastrami & cheese w/ egg), sometimes it just tasted like a bland french fry sandwich.  When the combination in my bite was just right, it was fabulous, but they could work a little more on the ratios so it's not quite so potatoey.  Prob wouldn't be such a big deal if the potatoes weren't a little bland (yes, there are tasty potatoes but not in the 20 lb costco bags).  Def the hot sauce at the table helped a lot with the potatoes.

-House Special Magic Noodle - $7.99 Small: 
this looked nothing like the picture on the menu LOL.On the menu the broth seemed to be red and there were more varieties of vegetables, so expect that the pictures might not resemble your actual dishes.

The texture of the noodle was spot on, slightly chewy, soft but not too soggy. The soup base was packed full of flavour, quite refreshing and not too salty at all. The pork was good, I just wished the pan-fried egg had a more gooey yolk and some kind of green vegetables would have been nice as well.

-Hand-Pulled Noodle with Pork Bone - $7.99 Large: 
Friend said there was nothing special and complained that there was barely any meat. The broth was not oily and again, very flavourful. I say skip this dish and get other type of meats with the hand-pulled noodles :).

-House Special Pork Burger - $3.99: 
Albeit it's a little bit oily, but I would order this again and I definitely recommend it! The pastry was crunchy, and it had a hint of nuttiness from the sesame seeds. The pork was a bit salty, soft and had a layer of fat running through. Together with the sesame pastry, it was a wonderful combination.... 

-Goubuli Chinese Bun (Pork & Leek) - $0.99
If you don't feel like having a bowl of noodle, lucky you there are other snacks or side dishes as well, and they are all cheap! The bun had a good filling to bun ratio and it was very ""supple,"" and had the right amount of elasticity to it. Furthermore, the filling was hearty and seasoned just right, the braising liquid was just enough to soak the bun without making it become soggy.",2015-06-23 23:38:16

What an awesome show!  We had pretty good seats, they were somewhere in the middle of the lower section but the theater isn't that large and during the show, the crew does acrobatics all over the theater-not just on the stage so I feel like there really isn't a bad seat in the theater.  

What I really enjoyed was that everyone was in character, even before the show started.  There were people that were part of the cast standing the doorways to greet us and they introduced themselves and they were definitely in character.  Some were very serious and some were funny and quirky, it was awesome.  Someone even introduced himself to us and said if we needed anything, to go ahead and let him know.  They had ushers at the ends of the aisles to help us find our seats.  

The cast was also walking around and they were in character the entire time before the show started, it seemed like they were Turing to ""build"" the story.  It's almost as if the show started as soon as we walked into the theater and now when everyone was seated.  It was so entertaining trying to figure out what was going on when the cast members were walking around, talking to each other in the made up language that they have.  They were climbing railings, doing somersaults, etc.  It was funny.  

A photographer came to take a few pictures of my boyfriend and I before the show started and she said they would be available for purchase right outside of the theater after the show was done.  

The show has a pretty good story to it-it's about journeys, conflict and love.  What's really amazing is the performers do acrobatics on, over and around the stage.  They even have moving platforms and lifts to help with the effects and change in the scenery throughout the show.  It's pretty mind-blowing how to climb, jump and bounce on and off of them.

This was my second trip to T Cook's for Sunday brunch.  The first time was good but they changed the format this year and, I must say, it made things better.

The new format is this:  you order a starter and an entrée and you also get access to a limited buffet.  By limited I mean you won't find the omelet station, the paella station, the salad bar, or the huge dessert area.  What you will find are shellfish, bread baskets, fruit, salads, and a small dessert area (which is plenty).  The starters and entrees are great.  I'd skip the pupusa and go with the scallops next time but other than that, there isn't much I would change. 

The price is fair and the live music is a nice touch.  If you have friends or family from out of town to entertain, stop by here on the weekend for brunch (it's Saturday's as well now).",2018-01-22 16:45:28

Th interior area and display cases are lovely.  You can't help but want to try everything. I Settled on a square slice of cappricosa pizza. The biggest surprise for me was the crust. You can put anything on this crust perfection. It was thin and crispy yet had this softness to the bread to compliment the ingredients and the crunch of the base. Best pizza crust I have had in this city.

However, I had one of the worst espressos here. I love my coffee. Bitter can be from over-extraction, fines in the coffee, too high a brew temperature. Real espresso is an experience hard to describe, but it's neither bitter or sour.  It should be wonderfully full, deep, slightly sweet, and depending on the blend it leaves an after taste either on the edge or back of the tongue (that isn't bitter).    (I went to dark horse right after, to try and get that espresso taste out of my mouth).

We ordered a couple regulars as well as a gluten free pizza for my mom and it was easily the best GF pizza we've had anywhere in the valley (go figure!!) 3 large pizzas plus a small order of fries that was actually quite large, ran about $50, fed 6 adults, 2 kids and provided ample leftovers. It would definitely be cheaper if you're not needing gluten free.

Sure, it's slightly annoying that they only take cash but they do have an ATM in the lobby if you don't plan ahead. The water tasted terrible. (Maybe that's just a City of Mesa thing?) so bring your own or just buy a pitcher of soda for $5.

Aside from those 2 negs., I would definitely recommend Organ Stop and I will most definitely return!",2014-05-27 23:14:36

My brother came today at lunch, and he brought me home food immediately after. Food was still fresh when I got it. Good stuff. Had a jerk chicken sandwich and two jerk wings. I wouldn't get the wings again. They were on the dry side, and not particularly outstanding. However, I would definitely get the jerk chicken sandwich again. At $4.75 including tax, this was quite the sandwich. This thing is the size of three or four patties stacked on top of each other. The bread was not particularly impressive, but I prefer my bread toasted, so fluffy doesn't quite cut it for me. However, there was an impressive amount of juicy jerk chicken inside, and the coleslaw definitely did cut into some of that jerk intensity. Good stuff. There was a bit of cartilage in my sandwich, but I can deal with that. A cheap eat, that sandwich is.",2016-11-13 04:10:26

A big group of us were here for an UYE family dinner arranged by Rachel B. (Thanks again!) and I had a really great time.

We arrived a little before 7 and the place was already hopping, the dining room was close to full and the bar was completely packed, so we were ushered into the Carriage Room in the back...we get our own private room?  We can be as loud as we want without the fear of disturbing other patrons of this lovely restaurant?  Score!  This was a really good move by the restaurant since we tend to be a more.....errrr, ""outgoing"" group, shall we say  ;o)

Our own private server was assigned to take care of our group and he did a wonderful job (good luck in medical school this fall!), especially dealing with the difficulty of the staggered entrance of our group.  Drinks started flowing minutes after we sat down and appetizers were flying out of the kitchen very soon thereafter.

I was able to try out a few different things by virtue of sitting next to a couple of gentlemen who enjoy sharing their food!

Mussels and clams to start were ok, a little on the smaller side and the broth wasn't anything outstanding.

The Poached Pear Salad was very good, something that I would definitely like to try and recreate at home.  Simple ingredients, but they played off of each other very nicely.  A light and refreshing interlude to my main course.

Gnocchi - oh yeah, what Stefanie C. said.....absolutely phenomenal.  And no, this isn't your typical store-bought gnocchi, guaranteed they were making this from scratch in the kitchen because each piece was a little bit of a different size and there were no machinery marks indicative of mass production on them at all.  Some of the best gnocchi I have ever had and I will come back for more.  The lobster and sweet corn with truffle, basil and roasted tomatoes worked perfectly for the dish, everything came together in sweet harmony.

The Grilled Lamb Chops were also something to write home about, especially that Pumpkin Gratin, WHERE did that come from??  Probably one of my favorite components of that plate!  And yes, finally a place that knows how to serve lamb chops....we were at Johnny's downtown for Restaurant week and that little rack of lamb served there paled in comparison to this beautiful composition.

Even though I loved my dishes, I was slightly jealous of Rachel B.'s veal tortelloni....I must try  ;o)

Goat Cheese Crème Brûlée.....I wasn't going to order this originally, I had my heart set on the Pear tartlette, but boy am I glad my dining partner put up a fuss!  ;o)  Absolutely incredible, so light and airy, it literally was a little piece of heaven in my mouth.....I really didn't want to share it at all, but I conceded a little bite of it in exchange for a bite of Tiramisu.  The Tiramisu was good, but not good enough to tear my greedy palate away from my goat cheese dessert!

The taste of all the food was great but goshdang the soup was so fattening. Good thing they don't have a program like Kinton with Kinton bowler because I don't think my stomach could handle it.

I had black garlicky soup, which is my ultimate fav, paired with sea salt in chicken broth, and thick noodles. It's pretty much my go-to. The downtown location has better soup because it isn't as fatty. The broth I got here was so fat that it congealed the moment the bowl landed on my table. .. Ew?

BIG Thanks for everyone for coming and to Nota Bene's management and PR team for being so lovely and accommodating. We loved the complimentary charcuterie. Delish, as always for our starving Yelpers! 

I'm so terrible, but Nota Bene on a whole is definitely on my top five favourite restaurants in the city. 

VIBE 
Our group was in the private room which is less like a white, windowless room a la Kubrick (thanks for the vivid imagery Vivek) and more like a sectioned off warm, dimly lit room off to the side of the main dining room. Lovely! 

The company was fantastic as well and so eager to try the food and burgers at Nota Bene! 

Service was phenomenal, as always. Our main server Sophia (I think that was her name) was so lovely, knowledgeable and quick on the menu. We also got separate bills (a MUST for a big group).  We may have even converted her over to Yelp! 

WE ATE 
Mainly, the burgers! I ate the burger, anyway. :) 
The size of the burger is quite surprising. It looks much bigger than it is but though it looks small it is DENSE and packs a punch! 
The parsley inside the burger was a surprise. I thought it might have a wee bit more flavour but I did like the kick of the stilton cheese on top of the burger. 
I liked that you could get the option of brie (didn't know!) 
Side pickles = bonus!

Though this was a solid burger, it was not my favourite. 
The fries were a good portion and accompaniment to the burger. 

But the burger crown still belongs to Holy Chuck in my books! 

That said, if you're on business and want something hearty before you're off to the airport, this is a good choice. I certainly wolfed down this burger! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I love having burger events. They're non pretentious ways to socialize and bond with people.

As we got in line to be seated, the place was packed with the young crowd at 3 am. We got seated right away at a booth that was clean. Good thing the waitress gave us a clean booth. 

They have grave yard specials. Hubby orders us two steak and egg breakfasts which comes with steak, eggs, hash browns and choice of toast. I got my steak medium well, eggs over easy with wheat toast. That special costs $4.95. That is the cheapest steak and egg breakfast you can find in Vegas. It is inside South Point hotel which is off the 15 freeway. 

Steak and eggs were delicious. Hash browns were cooked perfect. Steak was tender, and eggs and wheat toast were good. Our waters were refilled immediately as they were half empty. The waiters kept checking up on us. I like the great customer service here. You don't need a club card, but must be over 21 to get the grave yard specials. Good deal! Plenty of tables here, so the lines go quickly. I definitely would come back here for breakfast. If you are in Vegas, check this place out.",2016-02-12 22:35:06

We had a reservation for dinner to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary, saturday night. We got there early but were seated right away. It didn't seem too bad, for our time slot, but when we were leaving, there were people waiting to get seated. It's a good thing we had a reservation.

There is a coupon promotion (free appetizer) in the weekly mailed paper to area residents. Also, there is a Yelp promotion, when reviewers check in. You can use it or save it; it's nice to have that option.  

Menu: Huge! (I checked it out before coming here- on this site (4.5 stars), and on their website), a nice variety including regular dinners, Thai curry, sushi rolls, Hibachi dinners (all of them are base plus the entree, separate pricing), as well as the Children's Menu (under 12). Portions are large. I didn't know what I wanted to order, but then again, that's a good problem to have! 

Ambiance: Very nice, elegant, dimly lit, and clean. Tables seem more private because of the logo glass partitians. We were seated in the regular dining room section. The sushi chefs were in front of us in the same room (along the wall; all of them were asian). The other side was the Hibachi side (the smells were wafting down to our side; it also seemed to be the more popular room). 

Customer base: Families (with children) and seniors

Service: Excellent service from our server, Hong (Darren), who was very nice, and when we sent the curry back (it was too hot for my hubby at #2), he wanted to make sure that the second time, it was just right. We could hear the manager speaking to him, explaining, except he almost sounded irritated that we sent it back. He was in the bar area, which was just across from our table, a few feet. I appreciated that Hong remained polite and checked in with us several times and refilled hubby's water (without my hubby asking).  

We got the regular edamame appetizer, $3.50, the chicken egg rolls appetizer, free (used the coupon), the california roll, $4.95, seafood thai curry, $14.50, combination yakisoba, $12.95, and the kids teriyaki dinner, $11.95 (came with soup, salad, side, and stir-fried vegetables). Total cost of our dinner was $51.80, not including tip. The receipt shows suggestions for 18% (automatic for parties of 6 or more), 20%, and 30%. We even had leftovers! 

I really liked the taste of the food, the curry was delicious (with added chili pepper sauce- I like medium spicy, in general), the yakisoba (the veggies had a nice crunch, not soggy or overdone) my soup (mmm) and salad (that dressing!), and the side of fried rice (our son didn't want it, but he really enjoyed the soup and the teriyaki chicken) were the standouts for me. It was also surprisingly generous portions. My hubby liked it more the following day, said the taste was even better the second time around. The quality of the ingredients was also something I noticed.  

I also like the large menu, there is something for everyone (assuming one likes asian food, that is). All around, this restaurant is pretty impressive. And, we would come back here again, maybe even try the Hibachi next time.",2017-05-01 17:54:51

As I mentioned before the GS5 is my favourite combo because it's 3 rolls and they're all delicious- California, dynamite and kamakazi (salmon) I noticed yesterday how tiny these rolls are. The dynamite was especially disappointing because they're small rolls and dynamite rolls are typically a little bigger. There also was barely any shrimp. Also with the California rolls, barely any crab!

Also on a side note our waitress was so dull and unfriendly. Didn't smile once and rushed through our order.

Simple decor and clean. Service is 5 stars. 
They have everything related to Udon. The udon is handmade from scratch. It will make a difference between homemade and instant one. Udon is perfectly textured (chewy). The bukake is my favorite. The soup is on the side and it has a bit stronger taste. Today, I decided to get Kake Udon with a side of Kakiage (vegetable and seafood tempura). The portion is huge, I am so full for lunch! 

Price is a bit high. Shrimp tempura per pcs is $2. Hot tea in a can is $3. The plain udon Kake is $9 (does not come with anything except green onion and tempura flakes). 

Recommendation: price is high compared to other udon place. They should have lunch special with price range $8-12 like Oodle Noodle. I paid $18 for my lunch today and that's too steep of a price for everyday lunch. Also, they do not have fresh hot/cold tea. Green tea is from a can which I find that dissapointing.

The meal started out with the chips and salsa which were pretty amazing.  The salsa had more bite to it than normal salsa you'd get at Macayo's or Arriba's.  The chips were a wide variety that included everything from sweet potato to blue corn to a white corn with a sugar coating.  I got the carnitas platter and my boyfriend got the enchiladas and carnitas dish.  The carnitas were mouthwatering.  The combination of the meat with the guacamole and rice made the tacos to die for.  The cheese used in the enchiladas was rich and mouthwatering.  Different than just the typical cheddar cheese.  For dessert, I had the banana burrito which was okay.  I much prefer the banana tempura at Benihana.

I asked waiter (once I flagged him down) if gravy was suppose to be hot or cold, he told me hot- I told the waiter the gravy was cold and he said he would get me new one. I had 2 balls left...NEVER got gravy. We asked for check before done eating cause had to make it to movie theatre and took so long to order and I told him don't worry about the gravy, just take the balls away.

The interior of this place was very well done and there's plenty of seating at the bar and the surrounding area.

We also got some drinks off the happy hour menu. I tried the blood orange fizz and the mojito with the weirdly spelled name. Moscito? Both were good. My friend got the pomagranate margarita and liked hers as well. These are a good deal for the price.

The first time, we both had the chicken thighs roti and a double. Amazing! Super friendly service, and watching the roti master make those rotis is a real treat, too - the technique is special, because everything in this roti is so perfect. The hot sauce is mixed in just right with the potato curry liquid and the meat liquid... Wetness is perfect. Size is perfect. Filling, but not a monster-sized roti. Prices are low. Keep doing what you're doing, Island Foods. We'll be back!

For our second visit, we really wanted another roti and another double, but were committed to trying one of the plates. It looked like they weren't serving doubles that day anyway (Saturday), so that helped us stay the course. We both had oxtail stew - it comes with rice and peas, potatoes, veggies (mostly cabbage and onions, with some carrot and peppers). Hot sauce on everything and a second dose on the stew. Our mouths were burning! Again, perfect amount of meat / potato sauce for the rice.

Don't fool yourself thinking you can rush in here and get out quick - there will probably be a line-up of dedicated Island Foods fans - including me - waiting patiently before you. Join us.",2017-04-08 00:52:56

Unfortunately, Nando's fails to deliver in most of these categories. While the dark meat was tender and moist, the breasts were really dry. While the add on sauces were delicious, there wasn't enough already on the bird. The wingtips were really burnt, which lent a bitter taste to the rest of the dish. 

Surprisingly, the veggies were the highlight of the meal. A mix of roasted squash, corn, and raisins was very flavourful and cooked perfectly.

It has an upscale feel, while still remaining casual. It's been described as ""feeling like a pottery barn."" I quite like the ambiance, the mismatched furniture and chandeliers, it really takes me away from Vegas and makes me feel like I'm at a hip restaurant in a cool city. 

My husband and I first decided to check it out for lunch. He couldn't resist ordering the fried chicken sandwich and I went with the backyard burger. The fried chicken sandwich was juicy and delicious. I can see why people compare it to Chik-fil-A. The burger was seasoned perfectly, I really enjoyed the tomato jam since I'm notorious for picking my tomatoes off of my burgers. The shoe string fries were a perfect side.

More recently, my friends and I decided to check out their brunch. We started with some monkey bread for the table. It was ooey, gooey, and so delicious. It is perfect for splitting with the table and the hints of citrus really counter the sweet honey sauce. I settled on the steak and egg slider and it was a great decision. The steak was super flavorful and the entire thing just worked well together. I also felt somewhat healthy since there was creamed spinach. The breakfast potatoes were more like wedge fries, but I'm not one to complain about potatoes in any form. I also split some peach pancakes with a friend and they were delicious. There were peaches baked in, but could have used some more peaches on top. 

It wouldn't be a girls brunch without cocktails and they have a full bar. I had a delicious strawberry, prickly pear, lime, cocktail with citrus vodka. My friends all went with the bottomless mimosas, but weren't impressed with the $20 price tag.

I got the half pasta and soup or salad lunch combo. I ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti and a bowl of clam chowder. Reason why I got soup was because the last time I had the house salad, I didn't really like it. It didn't have enough dressing, it seemed a little dry. The spaghetti was really not that spicy but had a light kick and a different type of tomato sauce, but it was enjoyable. It was really good price, about $9! My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a bread bowl which was about $8. Their clam chowder is really good! It comes out hot and fresh. He adds a little tobasco for more flavor, and I just like it the way it is.

We had calamari for appetizer and it was delicious as well. It was crispy and a pretty decent size. I've seen it bigger at other places but I'm not complaining. This was about $10.25 I believe. 

As for dessert, ALWAYS the pizookie! Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is always the traditional way to go! Sooo yummy and always hits the spot.

Because I'm a BJs card holder, I was able to get $10 off $35 or more, and we had just reached $36. So the deal was soooo good! Imagine if I had 4 people come and everyone ordered off the lunch menu.... What a deal!!

This place is clean and friendly and has pretty good food. I've had their Cajun pasta and shrimp scampi, both very flavorful. I've also had the angel hair Classico which is not as flavorful but good if you don't want a strong flavored pasta. Their pizzas are yummy and shareable size!

I've wanted to give it a try since it opened because I heard good things.  I was worried that it might be busy after reading a few other reviews, but the place was pretty empty when I met my brother on a Tuesday afternoon.

While waiting at the bar, I ordered the Bacon and Crab Hush Puppies.  I was informed shortly after placing my order that they were out of the Cajun Mousse they are typically served on.  I was fine with that, and the cook offered to give me a few of their sauces to try instead.  The hush puppies were good, nice and crunchy on the outside but lukewarm in the center.  I thought they could have been hotter.  I did like trying the different sauces and the Siracha aioli was my favorite with the hush puppies.  The cook said that was his favorite, too, when he inquired about my feelings regarding the sauces.  Once my brother arrived, we ordered up a couple burgers.  My brother went with the Breakfast Burger, I went with the Fire Side.  The burger itself (grass-fed beef) was the highlight for me though it was a bit overcooked (I ordered medium but there was no pink in the middle).  Unfortunately the bun was not sturdy enough to support said burger and fell apart before I was done.

There's definitely that wood-fired smell, but, well, it's in the name so you shouldn't be surprised.  Knowing this is their cooking method should also explain the wait.  They do have their own parking lot which is a plus.  Though this was my first visit, I should mention their menu does change.  I'm not sure how frequently, but they previously offered a shrimp and grits plate that is no longer available.  A couple seated next to me left when they discovered this.

I have mixed feelings.  The draft list is above average.  The food is okay.  The service is great.  (Our server didn't charge me for a beer because they were out of the mousse for the hush puppies.)  I liked Fire Side Public House but there were too many hiccups for it to be my first choice next time I'm in the neighborhood.",2016-04-26 07:00:58

However, the service sucks ass.  Yes, horrible.  Why?  Because on my second visit in two months, I encountered the same thing - one server for a whole restaurant of people.  Not to mention the fact that the young lady was more interested in chatting with her friends who showed up to eat than serve our food.  To make matters worse, she still added the items that we ordered but never saw - so we had to send her back twice to get items taken off of the bill.

But enough of the crappy service, let's get to the food.  The ramen - good.  I mean, it's hard to find real ramen and those who have lived in Japan know that ramen is mean to be a meal, not a $0.30 college diet filler.  The tako yaki and okonomiyaki are good too.  My brother loves the salty salmon fried rice although the jury is out with me.

I can understand that they MAY be AKC registered (which looking at the paperwork is hard to believe.) and that makes them more valuable but let's be honest, these are animals from a PET STORE. Not a reputable breeder or a shelter. You can get a true AKC registered pet from a breeder for HALF the cost and with higher care of the animal. 

I give kudos to this place for making people sanitize their hands before touching the animals (unlike Pet Pros) however I did see them giving some of their puppies PINK water, which causes suspicion to the health of these animals. Usually when Pet Stores give animals water with ""medicine"" in it, it is so that they will pass the initial vet exam...(keep them healthy until their out of our care then who care's if they die). It's unfortunate but true.

When we first walked in, the host stand was unattended and we had to wait for a waitress to seat us.  When the host did appear, he was wearing a buffalo plaid flannel and flip flops.  Not the best first impression.
The table we were seated at was missing one place setting and flatware that was only corrected after we requested it after our first course was delivered.  Service was slow overall.  Food, on the most past, suffered from a lack of seasoning.  When we requested salt for the beef tartare, we were told that another table also asked for salt and that the kitchen was too busy.  When we pressed, we were then told there is a disagreement between chef and owner regarding salt at the tables.  We pressed again and salt was finally delivered.
Hamilton's offers small plates as well as a few larger.  My girlfriend and I ordered:
The aforementioned beef tartare
Little Gem salad
Grilled Octopus
Duck Breast

Beyond the lack of seasoning, we thought the dishes were good but not great.  The beef tartare has small pieces of croutons mixed in but needed something with more crunch to be served along side of it.  The salad was on the verge of being overdressed.  We thought the grilled octopus was excellent, perfectly charred and tender.  However, I feel it didn't mesh well with the potato salad served alongside.

Menu was big, they get props for having a ""chefs selection"" that includes necks, gizzards, all the offal that isn't always offered. Variety of sandwich options as well.

Food was good, I got the Rancher sandwich which is the basic sandwich (fried chicken breast, lettuce, pickle, tomato) plus bacon and ranch. I loaded up with the habanero sauce as well, don't fear, it's very mild. I wish it was a bigger piece of meat tho, definitely more toppings than meat. Fries and cole slaw were good, they're the thin crispy fries which I prefer to the thick cut steak fries. Cole slaw was more vinegar than mayo which was a nice balance. While tasty, I feel that the he chicken took a back seat due to portion size, had to knock down a star.

Atmosphere was cool, place was clean, people were nice. There were a variety of honey dipping sauces on a sauce bar by the drinks, I only briefly tried them since I got the sandwich, the wasabi honey was interesting.

Would I go back? If I lived in the area maybe, but I can't justify a return trip unless they open up in Henderson.",2017-02-11 06:33:44

The service is fast, friendly and on point.  Most department workers are very kind and are willing to go to the back to bring out fresh produce and meat if you ask.  The seafood department in particular are always willing to bring out fresh product if you ask.

I've never had to wait in line for more than a few minutes as they have a great check out system and minimal lines.

The soups were passable, not great and the beef shank and stew were the strongest points for the noodle soups. The spicy wontons weren't bad but they were tiny and timid.

There are also like over 4 dessert places. Gelato, chocolate tacos, candy, and I could keep going. 
I love the outdoor areas, with the art vendors and touch screen maps. A couple of lemonade stands would fit perfectly in the vicinity. The surrounding areas have your big name departments stores. There are my daughter's picks like Forever 21, and Charlotte Rouse. And of course my personal, all time favorite place, Lush. It actually is one of the larger Lush stores offered in Las Vegas, and I adore the staff! 
DTS is pet friendly, as I always see pups when I go. There is street parking if you are lucky enough to snag a spot. If you park in one of the near lots, I suggest noting a store or lot number.

Service is kind of weird as well. They seat you, bring menus and take your order. And once they bring your order over to you the service basically ends.

Anyway, it was all good, because we were able to get a quicker seat at Zink.  I am not sure what happened to M5, which was in this location before, but I can say that I have not had a bad meal at either of those 2 restaurants.  Needless to say, that streak is still alive.

Double date night with the wife and 2 other friends was the plan and we had a great meal.  As soon as I looked at the menu, the ""Nacho"" brisket burger was calling my name.  The burger is a mixture of their standard ground beef along with brisket, topped with avocado, habanero jack, tobacco onions, chipotle aioli and black bean corn salsa.  It also came with a side a fries, which were just ok.  The burger, on the other hand, was the best that I have had in a while.  It had some nice spice to it and all the toppings went well together.  It was a little messy to eat, but our server was good enough to get me a second napkin, which came in handy towards the end. 

The wife had their red snapper fish special for the night, and it came with spicy ""angry corn"" and sliced, broiled heirloom tomato with creamy, melted goat cheese on top.  Once again, we had another very pleased diner.

It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive win from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.

My husbands from Louisiana and I've been wanting to take him here and right away he felt as if he were home and was anxious to taste the food. 

Most everything we ordered from crab cakes to soft shell crabs were great, however I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo and I should of known since it wasn't fried the chicken came out under cooked the waitress was kind enough to take it back said they were going to redo the plate and she returned the same dish with the same chicken with parts of the chicken recooked and of course it was still under cooked...I pushed the chicken to the side and ate some of the pasta, she returned and I expressed to her that the chicken was still under cooked and she said Lola wanted to see it and took the plate away...I never got the plate back and she did remove it from the ticket however expressed that Lola said it was cooked....HUMMM I thought that when you dined out that the customer was always right.....guess not in this case?

I wasn't upset I wasn't dissatisfied with our meal(s) at all we enjoyed the vibe and the food however as a tip to Lola and her staff....If a customer says the food is undercooked that maybe it's not cooked enough for their liking and just fix it! 

I recommend this place if you go in earlier in the day not wait till your the last of the customers and don't get the greens unless you like allot of vinegar with your greens....The grits, soft shell crab and the artichoke dip is amazing, the gumbo was just okay!",2013-04-14 06:10:12

We decided to try the Sirloin Sliders as our appetizer course.  The portion size was immense for an appetizer, but the flavor was spectacular.

For entrées, we ordered the Chicken & Pesto Fetish and the Pulled Pork Sandwich respectively.  The chicken sandwich was fantastic, served on a toasted ciabatta roll with a very tasty pesto spread.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and was complimented nicely by the saltiness of the feta, an interesting choice for such a sandwich.  It was delicious.  The pulled pork sandwich was equally impressive.

The place really does have the look of a 1970s Chinese joint as has been said by other reviewers.  They also have that little mini grill lit by sterno that they put on the table so you can cook meat on a stick (or burn it if you are not careful).  They don't have that back home. . .

Sure, I'd eat there again some time, but this place can't compete even with the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.

As a weekly connoisseur of Vietnamese food in Charlotte's mainstays for the cuisine (thanks Lang Van and Ben Than!, I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing out on the next great thing.  Having tried it now, I can say it is good and (mercifully) cheaper than the competition, but it still needs a little work.

The first issue is location, I don't know about you, but I had a to make a special trip that far down South Boulevard.  And even then, I got the pleasure of pulling a U-y to get on the right side of the street to enter the parking lot.  If you are coming from uptown. this means you too.  The building itself is small and rather non-descript, standing as an outparcel on the edge of (yet another) S. Blvd. strip mall.

The inside was small but adequate and quite clean.  I don't know why this is apparently mandatory at Vietnamese joints, but they also had the jazzy-elevator music in the background pumping all the classics.  I also got a kick out of the wall ""art"" which was a very exact clock and calendar with the ""moving water"" around a non-descript island- so kitsch it was out of place.

Our waitress/server was a young girl how did not strike me as overly prepared for the job.  At first I wasn't sure that she was not another customer as she carried this small purse around with her that I later came to understand was where she kept her note pad and extra menus for taking orders.  That said, she did check on us several times and clear plates quickly.

Carnivores are in luck here as the menu was broken down by your meat of choice.  All the regular Vietnamese offerings are here- bun, pho, etc.  You basically pick your protein and voila!  Veggie friends need to turn to the back of the menu for a small offering of dishes, all of which basically have tofu (with the exception of the stir-fried mixed greens, which didn't sound over-appetizing).  I actually like tofu in my asian dishes, so this was okay for me, but the menu was a little light here and was especially weak considering the cross-town competition.

The wife and I had the tofu summer rolls and I have to say, they are quite a bit larger than elsewhere in town, and apparently this is due to the sheer volume of rice noodles inside the rolls.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the fresh mint and lettuce tucked into the very center, but the taste was somewhat lost of the volume of noodles.  I'd have toned this down to let the fresh herbs do their thing.  Luckily the peanut dipping sauce was nice and plentiful.

Apparently their hot sellers are their Phos, as every other table around us had this dish.  Kudos to the huge bowls and plates of fresh herbs that came with these dishes.  I could easily have shared just one and we'd have both been stuffed.  The portions were enormous and if that didn't fill ya, well, there'a gotta be a buffet somewhere nearby you can shut down.

For the wife and I, we went with the veggie curry and despite its appearance, it was quite taste.  Curry was yellow and a nice mix between spice level and pungency.  It had some mixed diced veggies in the sauce, but oddly came with a side of plain steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the veggies, but I didn't order curry because I didn't like the heat.  An opportunity was lost here.

Having looked at the final bill, though, I was pleasantly surprised.  Lunch for two for under $20, now we're talking.  In fairness, we did split the entree, but it was plenty sufficient for for us.  Still, the (comparatively) limited menu and missteps in the prep of our dishes holds this Grille back from becoming the new talk of the town.",2011-02-21 19:10:33

It has all the AMBIANCE you could ever want...although they might want to consider offering headlamps to read the menus as it is indeed pretty dark...one can overdo it, this isn't O Noir after all.

The FOOD: 
~~~Prime Rib ($32 w/salad & sides, $26 w/o) is a delightful tender, juicy cut of meat.  I'm a sucker for horseradish and prime rib, and this perfect combination was cooked just as I asked for.

~~~Filet Mignon ($39 w/salad & sides, $33 w/o) was also just perfectly done.  I have a hard time describing a well-cooked steak.  You know it when you see it.

One nice tip is that you can substitute any salad in these dinner combinations and I've enjoyed the mixed greens or the spinach salad.  They're pretty unimaginative and equivalent to what you can do at home, but tasty.  If you're going to get a salad or side, then it's cheaper to do the combo.

The only thing was bad was that they used to offer a passion fruit creme brulee.  The waitress warned me about it, but I ordered it anyway.  It was awful, she was right.  She promptly took it off the bill and took it away.

The SERVICE:
It took me a few minutes to come up with the right description.  It's very good service, but in the Stepford Wives sort of way.  It's a rehearsed casual tone.  I can't complain, they're always pretty good and responsive.

OVERALL, this place is a bit of a splurge, but if you stick to what they claim to do well (dead cows), then you will not be disappointed.  Nothing avant garde going on here.  I'm fine with the basics, but at this price point, I wouldn't mind just a little bit of creative cooking thrown into the mix.  The chain nature also comes through including with the tacky upsells to the ""Keg Size (R)""....and I'm not kidding that it has a reserved mark next to it.

A TIP:  Make sure you have a reservation.  This place can be busy almost any night of the week.",2014-04-05 00:37:12

Every venue from hunting, trapping, guns, handmade crafts, Native American jewelry, cowboy hats crafted, handmade boots, belts, leather, the arena was gigantic, more than one could imagine, and I have been to many tradeshows at the convention center, but the Cowboy Christmas showed the nationwide appeal of this market. This show in December made it obvious that the NFR associated with the Las Vegas Convention Center is of supreme importance to economic growth in Las Vegas, Nevada. One great example was weather. Many of the visitors enjoyed the sun. I walked with them from breakfast at Peppermill to dinner at Piero's Italian Cuisine across the street. I rode in tourists shuttles with the tourists from Mandalay Bay to World Market Center and the Plaza Hotel and Casino. Many wanted to move to Vegas to buy house  because of the weather. Back home, their friends saw pictures on social media and called back to tell them that it was snowing back home. Las Vegas was hot, sunny, gorgeous weather.

Upon entering Butcher and the Rye I was sort of surprised by the décor but also thought that it was pretty cool with the first thing catching my eye the large and tall displays of Whiskey behind the bar.  Since we arrived about 5 minutes after our reservation time (crazy theater traffic) we were immediately shown to our table and I didn't get to see as much downstairs as I would have liked.  As we headed up the first set of stairs I thought it was cool that they had a couple of different levels and then we headed up to a third level which had a bar and some lounge type seating.  We ended up being sat in the lounge type seating which meant that my fiancé and I were stuck on a long couch that had a back about 2 feet behind us while our dining companions were stuck on some tiny stools.  What kind of table is that for people that made their dinner reservations 6 weeks earlier?  By the time we had finished dinner and our desserts I was more than ready to have something to lean my back against.  Other than the weird seating that we were provided the top floor was pretty cool and gave all of us a hunting lodge type feel including a wood ceiling that made you feel like you were in a log cabin.

I decided to start off my evening with one of their cocktails since I had read many people raving about them on Yelp.  So I went with the Butcher Sour which consisted of Bulleit Rye, an egg white, lemon and bitters.  It was a pretty good drink which I enjoyed sipping throughout dinner. For dinner I decided on splitting the mac n cheese and Brussels sprouts with my fiancé while getting the dirty pasta for myself.  After we had ordered the waitress told us that items here come as they are ready from the ktichen and she certainly wasn't kidding.  First up was the mac n cheese which was pretty amazing.  As a matter of a fact I think it might be the best mac and cheese that I have had in Pittsburgh.  It was very decadent and rich with a number of different cheeses that had the perfect amount of gooiness to them.  In the middle of eating the mac and cheese our Brussels Sprouts came out.  They were also delicious with the sprouts being cooked very crispy with the brown butter, parmesan and lemon aioli giving them some nice depth although honestly they were good enough that I probably could have been just as happy without most of that.  As we were finishing that the Dirty Pasta's came out and so there were two of us eating our main dishes while the others had nothing in front of them.  The dirty pasta was easily my least favorite dish of the evening and consisted of ground duck, strozzapretti, sage, brandy and pecorino romano.  It started out well enough and I loved the ground duck but eventually the salt in the sauce became too much for me and by the end of the bowl I was not enjoying it at all.  I was also able to try my fiancés wagyu flank steak which was cooked nicely and which she loved.  After we had all finished our meals both of the ladies at our table ordered deep fried brownie for dessert.  After a fairly long wait and an apology from the waitress the brownies were delivered to the table.  Both of the ladies raved about how good they were with the outside of the brownie being a little hard while the inside was gooey.

The bottom line for me is that I can't really see myself coming back to the Butcher and the Rye too soon in the future.  While some of my dishes like the Brussels and mac and cheese were absolutely amazing I can't say that I was too happy with my main dish nor with our seating.   My fiance also encouraged me to give this 4 stars as she enjoyed her experience but mine was a little less enjoyable with my too salty main dish.",2014-03-01 16:11:16

But that is quickly forgotten about once you get to the bar and peruse the on tap craft beer list.  They say they have 16 always rotating beers to choose from.  I tried the Spoonwood beer and enjoyed it very much.  My friends and I sat at the bar until we finished our first beer, talking with the bartender who was very knowledgeable and able to help with choosing a beer based on our likes. We then moved to a table for dinner.  It was simply easier since we were a group of four to sit at a table.  We had appetizers, fried pickles and brushetta, which were good. For dinner I got a chicken sandwich. It tasted great.  I finished up with a Southern Tier Pumking beer.  This is an odd beer that comes with a sugar ring at the rim of the glass, the way a margarita has salt along the rim.  The taste was good at first but quickly seemed weird.  Its hard to say whether it was good or bad so I think I will stick with odd. If I have a headache tomorrow, it will be due to this beer.

Instead, there a whole pieces of chickpeas. This was a great surprise as the chunks gave a nice texture to what is usually a mushy ball of chickpeas. The best part of the meal are the sauces.

Sorry, I couldn't figure out a satisfying conclusion to that catchphrase. But Chinese food isn't something that I tend to crave. It doesn't come to my mind as really must-eat since it became mundane territory with wedding banquets and dinners with relatives growing up. Long story short, I've rarely eaten it in Vegas.

However, an opportunity came today when several friends gathered at HK Star for dinner. It was my first time here, so I mostly deferred to others for ordering. We ended up having more than enough for all of us.

- ""Spicy"" jellyfish ($9.95): always seems like more of a textural experience for me than something that I seek out for a special flavor, but it was crunchy enough and came with pickled onions. I didn't really detect any heat when I ate it. I'd skip it unless you specifically like jellyfish or want to try it.

- Minced chicken with sweet corn thick soup ($9.95): they bring out your large bowl and then ladle it into smaller bowls at the table. Much better than the last corn soup I had, but let's not dwell on it. Definitely solid flavor in the corn, egg, and chicken in this soup.

- Honey walnut shrimp ($14.95): I specifically ordered this. The shrimp were cooked fine, although they could have been more crunchy. Good flavor, not overly drenched with sauce, and plenty of chopped honey walnuts. I usually prefer whole walnuts, but these were fine.

- Deep-fried flounder ($23.95): my favorite dish of the night. Tender, delicious fried fish that you'd expect to get from a Chinese restaurant.

- Chinese broccoli ($9.95): I'm not a vegetable aficionado really, but these were crunchy and juicy. They are worth an order.

- Seafood, dry scallop and egg white fried rice ($14.95): tasty enough and not overly fatty, but I wasn't that impressed when considering the price. My friends definitely loved it though.

- Roast duck ($19.95 for a ""whole"" order): a little less sweetness than you might find elsewhere, but juicy and flavorful.

- Lobster, breaded and fried ($94.27 for 4.5 lbs at current market price): They pulled a lobster for us to look at when we were ordering, then took it back to the kitchen. It came out tasting pretty good, and it was cooked properly except for the claw piece that I had (too mushy there), more of the salty flavor is in the breading than in the actual lobster meat. I would probably try a different lobster preparation next time.

- Complimentary hot dessert soup: delicious and not overly sweet.

They probably have a pretty big kitchen in the big. Despite a fairly crowded dining room, our dishes all came out quickly and in quick succession, requiring some careful manipulation of the Lazy Susan and the other free table space to hold all the dishes satisfactorily. A server helped out a little over halfway through by giving us fresh plates and taking away the old ones with bones and mixed sauces. Decor is certainly on the nicer side for a Chinese restaurant.

At the end of the night, I felt satisfied with most of the dishes. I have no problem coming back here for Chinese food should the craving actually strike.",2015-06-22 06:45:59

The menu is extensive; it seems to cater to customers who want an authentic dining experience as well as those who are looking for more Americanized Chinese food (example: the family next to us ordered chicken & broccoli, General Tso's chicken, and dumplings, although there's nothing wrong with that!). It's great that the menu was organized, clean, and colorful with high quality images of menu items to help you choose what you want. We ordered the diced spicy chicken, pork belly, and green beans. They got our first milk tea order wrong so we got an extra one for free (yay). The spicy chicken was at the perfect level of spiciness--we had asked for it to be a little less spicy, but not sure if it actually was--and was very flavorful. The pork belly (basically bacon because it was so thin) was decent. The green beans were a little different from what I'm used to; they were crunchier than usual and I felt that the flavor was off. Portions were good and our server was nice. Chengdu Gourmet offers a lot of variety; there's something for everyone, so don't be afraid to come with a more diverse group.

MiMqmLRQXCmble_Zpe5_9w,2xVrxhQJUBmOyG4ML77XKw,alncf_6juI-sJJ5afONm0g,4,5,1,3,"For years, The Drake Hotel on Queen West has been an eclectic hub for artists and musicians wishing to express themselves artistically. When it comes to culinary creativity, executive chef, Alexandra Feswick at the Drake's Sky Yard restaurant showcases her unique talents with flair and finesse. I attended the Drake Hotel's summer party on the bustling, yet intimate patio at Sky Yard to sample the restaurant's newly launched summer menu. 

Feswick's summer menu features fresh and local seasonal items to tickle your taste buds. Her beets and blue cheese salad is an excellent way to begin any meal. Light and refreshing, the dish is comprised of Ontario Stilton, roasted beets, fresh raspberries, toasted sunflower seeds, watercress and flavourful avocado cream. 

Crowd-pleasing albacore tuna ceviche with avocado and charred scallion puree was a big hit. Perfect for sharing, scrumptious morsels of ceviche sat atop a perfectly crispy taro chip, which disappeared all too soon, but the sampling did not end there.Seafood lovers will be in seventh heaven when they take a bite of the pan seared Ontario pickerel with fennel, arugula, pickled cipollini onions and white anchovies. Sourdough croutons gives the dish a nice crunch, while sherry vinaigrette complements the dish with an acidic bite.

A tortilla cradling creamed corn garnished with grilled peach relish is an interesting combination that had me craving more. While I usually enjoy tortilla chips with a piquant salsa, the sweet and salty combinations of corn, peach and chips were both surprising and delightful. 

Whet your whistle with Sky Yard's new Drink Well bottle service program. Take mixology into your own hands by creating classic Drake cocktails such as the dark 'n stormy, Moscow mule, mojito,gin 'n tonic and the old fashioned. A mixologist attended to our party, delivered the essential ingredients and taught us how to craft the perfect cocktail. Interactive and fun, the Drink Well program is a more relaxed approach to ordering bottle service and is perfect for birthday parties, a unique bachelorette party idea or simply trying something new. 

The evening ended on a sweet note with summery strawberry baklava. Baklava on its own is saccharinely sweet and I was concerned that the dessert would be overly sweetened with the added strawberries. However, it was love at first bite! Decadent and delicious, the strawberry filling was tart and the sweetness was cut with balsamic vinegar under layers of phyllo pastry. 

Take advantage of the balmy summer weather at Sky Yard and bask in the sun while enjoying  a great evening of delicious food and drink.

Although I don't think it beats out some of my California favorites, Monta Ramen is a solid ramen shop...just be mindful of the wait.

+Let's talk about pricing first. I got the tonkatsu ramen for a pretty reasonable price ($8.50) that includes a mixture of kikurage, bamboo, green onions and two pieces of chasu. It's a bit light on the items it comes with, which is a little bit unfortunate. I added egg and extra chasu for about $3.50 more. You can get drinks here for fairly cheap. Beer is only about $3 but note that they only have Asahi/Bud. They also have a number of side dishes, some coming in different sizes like gyoza to a chasu bowl. They also have a number of different ramen types which look interesting.
+Flavor-wise, I think the tonkatsu ramen was really solid. The broth had a simple but filling flavor. The chasu nearly seemed to melt in your mouth with the fat easily tearing off as you chew. Not the 'softest' chasu I ever had but comes pretty darn close. I did think adding extra chasu (which was about another 4-5 pieces) seemed a little overkill though for me personally. The noodles were pretty good although didn't stand out as anything different that you might expect. They have a variety of regular condiments for you to use from ginger to sauces. 
+Staff was friendly and attentive. Loved seeing the kitchen from the bar area as in most ramen places.  

+/- Seating (which I'll mention again below) is tight. There's a small bar area and a few tables. Don't expect to bring a huge group here.
+/- Parking is in the same plaza as a few other popular restaurants like Raku. It didn't seem overly busy in the daytime but it's definitely a tighter space for parking to be mindful of. 
+/- Note they have a $10 credit card minimum. 

-Man, this place is small. I came about 11:45AM (15 minutes after opening) and it already was a 25 minute wait. Those who came right after had to wait longer for sure. Be mindful of this when you stop by and especially with the hot summer months, you might be waiting out in the hot weather. 
-Again, as noted above, don't expect too many toppings on your ramen as in some other places. 

All-in-all, a pretty solid spot with a good wait. Come early, eat happy!",2017-07-20 02:54:56

Yeah, it's a chain and I ALWAYS order the same thing every time. I really REALLY love it! Always consistently amazing and never disappointing!

So for last night at THIS location:

Bread with butter- Awesome! What is it, molasses bread or something? Whatever it is, the semi-crusty bread with fresh whipped butter was good enough for me to eat an entire mini loaf myself (and I usually never fill up on bread).

Caesar salad- The first time I had an Outback Caesar, I didn't really care for it. It does not taste like your average Caesar dressing, it's got a peppery kick to it. It grew on me however, now it's my favorite! So good and well dressed with plenty of croutons!

Herb-crusted prime rib (picture posted)- OMG, this is even more amazing than the ""regular"" prime rib I used to get here (which they don't have anymore). I always get it medium-rare without steak sear (I would think searing it would defeat the purpose of eating a nice, pink cut of prime rib). Oh, also ask for the creamy horseradish on the side. I wish I knew the recipe for it because it's delicious and not overly spicy. I usually do not have a large appetite, but  I must admit to finishing an entire 16oz cut, just couldn't stop eating (fyi, over the 8oz cut, you can get 16 for just $5 more... much better deal).

Green beans- Even the green beans here were picture perfect and  cooked just right. They reminded me of the ones I had at Morton's (which is pretty pricey in comparison).

Sangria- I had the blackberry and strawberry-peach. They were both good, but go with the latter, it was by far the best.

Waitstaff- Our waitress was pretty good. Very professional and friendly, but not overly so (some people may like or dislike that). No complaints here! I also liked how another waiter and even the manager pitched in to clear some of our dishes when she was busy. That's teamwork! Oh, the manager also stopped by to ask how our food was, shows he genuinely cares!  :)

*My 2-cents on a recent reviewer that blamed Outback for giving him and a friend a bad cold/flu. These viruses take time to incubate, up to 2 weeks in some cases. The likelihood of becoming this ill after less than 24 hours of exposure is pretty low in my experience (I'm a mom and have been sick many times in my life). I've also been sick at the same time as friends who live across town that I haven't seen for awhile, same symptoms and everything. We live in a big city with a lot of nasty non-handwashers. Just thought a possible coincidence with no real basis for blame was unfair for a 1-star review.  :/",2013-05-10 14:20:48

Brunch menu was a bit limited in my opinion. The blue cheese was delicious, the fresh bread was to die for! (Mouth watering as I type). The main course was okay. Ambience is nice. My only other complaint is that we were next to the corner booth - thank goodness we weren't stuck there because the tables were jam packed so tightly.

This one doesn't seem so busy during off-peak times (weekday nights vs. weekends). My most recent visit was last week, on a thursday night. I got a couple things and paid in the cosmetics department. I came in through the garden center door and saw some Christmas inflatables, which were reasonably-priced (some were in the $20 range). The Christmas department's usually gets my attention, but like I said, I was there to get a few things; had a lot of other stops that night (no browsing allowed).   

It might sound funny to mention this, but the parking lot isn't as dirty (food trash, smashed drink cups, used dirty diapers) as compared to other busier locations. Once on a weekend, there were a group of young girls selling candy for a fundraiser, in the parking lot. I remained in the car, but they didn't bother me.

Each day they have a little board and have two different espressos and a pour over coffee and also a brewed coffee (methinks) they also have other different options that I don't know much about!

Eastern Euro lady with a wonderful accent (owner I think) to greet you. 

The beer selection is fantastic, with very hard to find euro beers (think Poland, Croatia, etc.), and a sweet little patio to boot. Let's add in some DELICIOUS elk stew from a Sweedish recipe. Damn. I was shocked at how fantastic this was... Plus, they gave it to me on a bed of perogies!

I've been here a few times and remembered not ever being that impressed, but decided to give the joint another shot. Plus it was a gorgeous night and this place has awesome outdoor seating. 

This place is known for their vegetarian and vegan selections and they are perfectly accommodating for meat eaters as well. The menu has tons of options. we first ordered the nachos as an appetizer since the table next to us had them and they looked incredible. They were delicious! Although, the nacho chips themselves were very salty. The salsa was great and we really enjoyed them. 

For a meal, my boyfriend ordered their American cheeseburger. He enjoyed it but said there wasn't anything that noteworthy about it. I ordered off their vegetarian menu and had their potato tacos. From the description, they were supposed to be made with smashed potatoes... Smashed, to me, means that they still are chunky potatoes with hints of mashed pieces. The potatoes on my tacos were literally mashed potatoes.. It was very odd. I ate them , but did not really enjoy them. I ordered their string fries as a side rather than beans and rice and found them to be very salty. 

Overall- it's an average place with awesome outdoor seating and an awesome selection of vegetarian and vegan items. I probably won't return unless a group of friends insist that we go.",2014-09-11 15:29:53

Had the 2 meat combo. Had the Notorious ribs and teri chicken with rice and double mac salad.

The chicken was good, will get sauce on the side next time though because it spills all into the rice a bit too much for my taste. But it was seared well and had good flavor and texture.

The boneless shortrib (basically korean bulgogi) was pretty dissapointing as a korean lol. The marinade flavor was good, but the cooking of the meat was done pretty poorly. Looks like they arent using a hot enough grill, or they are just overloading the grill with too much cold meat. It was basically boiled marinated meat. Zero char or searing on the beef which is crucial in my opinion. 

The mac salad was mac salad. 

They did give me 2 complimentary churros which was honestly the highlight for me. They should sell larger sized ones for sure.

Overall it was just okay, I didnt really get a warm greeting either which is important to me being a business owner myself that cares ALOT about customer experience. The food was nothing to write home about. Might come back to try some other stuff if Im in the area.",2017-12-18 19:04:04
DLMp7sQaARmSkUcSKSrpPA,Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,3,4,1,2,"on two occasions, my best friend and I had came here for a drink/dessert after a meal. 

First time we had came here, we had ordered an ""orange yuzu summer fruit tea"", ""mount Charleston toast"", and ""taiyaki with topping""

Second time we had came here, we had ordered ""Simore egglette"", ""hibiscus lychee summer fruit tea"", and ""jasmin milk tea"" 

According to our waitress, the ""orange yuzu summer fruit tea"" is only available in the large size. True or not? we don't know but we just followed what we were told. Nice orange/yuzu drink with a gradient of colors for which we were not able to tell the difference between taste in colors so we believe it all tastes the same, just colored. Nice yuzu citrus drink. One of their popular items 

The ""hibiscus lychee summer fruit tea"" tasted like a pure lychee drink. We've experienced one time before having a Hibiscus drink in Kauai, HI a few years ago which had a particular, unique taste. This did not have it. Avail in small and large sizes

The ""jasmin milk tea"" ... yes it was spelt jasmin on the menu and not Jasmine (typical Asian place with typos/spelling errors XD). Avail in small and large size, I had opted for the small since it was after dinner. Their ""small"" is pretty decent sized. Tea flavor wise, the jasmine flavor came out pretty good. It was pretty heavy in milk/cream too as you can taste the ""heaviness"". Overall was pretty sweet. Wonder if you can ask for a reduction in sweetness. Half would be more than enough for me. 

Now onto the desserts ! Of the 3 we ordered, the ""taiyaki with topping"" was the more underwhelming and unfortunately not so good. Topping choices include red bean, nutella, vanilla custard, banana, mocha, pocky sticks, ice cream, marshmallow, cotton candy. The waitress unfortunately not so good in speaking English made it a bit confusing on what you do with this. When I thought of topping, it was a pick of 1 item of the list. She told me there was a topping and filling. I opt'ed for strawberry ice cream and nutella. When it came out, the waitress or whoever made it, opt'ed without question to put marshmallow as a filling. There was a ""diagram"" on yelp which stated the outside being crispy. Definitely not and far from it. Whatever batter they used was dry and soft. Great presentation with it being in a cone stand served with a spoon. Best part was probably the strawberry ice cream and nutella. Which was supposed to be the topping/filling/whatever you call it. MUCH work needed for the batter used on the taiyaki part. Better explanation needed for topping/filling/etc. 

The ""mount Charleston toast"" with golden toast, fresh fruit and served with sweet cream on top. When it had arrived, the toast were cut into ""sticks"" and ""stacked"" like jenga. Similar to something we've had before at Oh My Pan in LA. Served with a scoop of ice cream on top, in a ""pool"" of ""cream"" and maybe a few pieces of ""fresh fruit"". Oh there were little mounds of whipped cream in the corners of the plate too. I for one had totally expected way more pieces of fruit. The toast itself and ice cream was tasty. All of it sitting in a pool of cream is a bit weird. 

The simore egglette was surprisingly probably the most favorable item of the 3 ive had so far. Surprising as it was much better than I had thought, esp after having the other 2 before. Unfortunately, the eggettes (why is it called egglettes...) is really dough-y and filled with filling. Not light. It is a little crispy tho so ill give them that. But makes me miss the ones in Sau Kei Wan in Hong Kong so much ! T_T ! The eggette itself topped with marshmallows, chocolate ice cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup, and some ""crumbs"" on top. Presentation pretty nice. At least not sitting in a pool of cream. 

Overall, service is a bit lacking. They never bring you the bill so you'd have to go up yourself to pay. The drinks are a bit ""diabetes"" for my own preference. Maybe ill try a different ""egglette"" next time as that was the ""best"" item ive had so far..",2017-01-29 20:09:15

Positives:
Food quality - I really enjoyed the food.  The lumpia shanghai rolls were delicious, as always, no matter where I go.  The fried chicken is what they specialize in, and is a mandatory order, also good.  I also had a vegetarian dish which I thought was really good, even though I don't usually eat vegetables.  

Interior - Better than most other asian restaurants.  This place is new, and so the decor reflects that.  It is a comfortable place, despite the slow service and wait to get a table.  

Location - Decent.  I'm not from the area, so I can't really comment.  But its on a main road, and not out of the way.

Negatives:
Service - the servers had a good attitude, but they are highly understaffed.  The enitre meal took us about 2.5 hours to complete, from the time we walked in, to the time we left.  When we first got there, it was rammed.  They told us it would take about an hour before we got seated, and they were right.  After we finally got our table, it took a while for our watier to take our order.  And even longer for our food to get delivered to our table.  It's not the waiters fault, he has so many table to look after.

You're bound to find something to eat here if you're not craving for anything in particular. If not, I would suggest going with their famous Zingers, which is boneless chicken wings. Sounds plain, boring and normal right? Wrong! The way they make these are different from your average joe boneless wings. The amount of crispiness and flavoring is JUST right. My boyfriend and I chose their Garlic Parmesan flavoring. Damn...writing this is making me crave for some right now.

For our entrees, we got the Chicken Parmesan and Jambalaya. Both were very very delicious. 

This restaurant did not disappoint at all. I will def be back here...and soon. I like the menu on their website because it actually lists PRICES!!!!! Oh. my. goodness! Granted, as listed, their prices may vary between locations but at least you get a jist of how much your bill will run you...give or take a few bucks. I hate it when restaurants lists their menu but no prices are to be found. THAT...is useless. 

It gets EXTREMELY EXTREMELY busy, loud and packed with people with a big game is on. Or any type of sports game as a matter of fact. Miller's Alehouse is great for parties, a fun night out, catch up with your friends day etc.... BUT...I wouldn't recommend coming here on a first date or any business related meetings (because this place can get pretty loud).",2013-07-15 20:03:20

I rarely eat on King Street West so I always assumed that prices at the restaurants would be super expensive. However, when I saw The Red Tomato's menu, I was pleasantly surprised that the prices were quite fair (ranged from $13-$18 for a full size pizza).

My friend and I got to try a nice array of pizzas that were offered at the restaurant. My absolute favourite out of the bunch was the Peking Duck Pizza ($18), which was one of their Asian fusion items. If you love Asian food, I do recommend the Peking Duck Pizza! My friend however thought it wasn't that great and preferred ""The Hangover Cure"" ($16) without the egg. I enjoyed every single pizza at The Red Tomato that I got to try (which is rare!). Each pizza is savoury and you can taste how fresh they are!

We sat in the main dining room, a modern, sleek space that came off as a little too sterile and corporate. The colourful paintings on the walls helped to warm the space up a bit though and our server was an extremely professional fellow who was generous in his time and opinions regarding the highlights of the menu. Plus the fact that no one batted an eye as I strode up to the table in neon birkenstocks is a plus. A major plus!

Anywhoo. The food was excellent and up to par as expected. We enjoyed the crispy duck slaw, tuna tartare as starters (both had such vibrant bright flavours) and a couple members of the group had the charcuterie board. I was lucky enough to savour a few bites off this gold mine and it's definitely one of the better boards in town: crispy pork jowl, lonza, chorizo, maple cured bacon and duck proscuitto. I'll be coming back to sample the whole hog another time for sure! Aside: one brave member of the group actually had the charcuterie board to start and the boudin noir tart to follow-all in the name of gourmet research of course. :)

I ordered the stilton brisket burger to start and it was a beefy, juicy creation saddled in on a brioche bun. This was a hefty, meaty burger which I enjoyed though not as much as Harbord Room's burger which I consider to be more flavourful.  

Dessert was a cherry crumble for me, a simple thing but very comforting end to a fabulous meal. Someone else was lucky enough to order the sorbets paired up with fruit and I think she had the luck of the draw; that passionfruit sorbet was most refreshing and exquisite. I am still thinking about it today!

There were four parties, including ours, with 10 or more people yesterday and the staff handled it well.  The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal, but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry.

I ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  For soup I ordered the tortilla soup.  The sandwich was the turkey Cobb.  The soup was outstanding.  The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness.  There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich.  It was billed as roasted turkey.  Well, it was, but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich.  It also says with blue cheese dressing.  It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not.

As for our server, she was really good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low.  She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends.  He ordered another beer and when she brought it, she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork.  That's a big no no!!

The weirdness started when we got seated. Our waiter introduced himself, took our drink orders, then left. A few minutes pass and another waiter comes up, introduces himself, and takes our drink orders. No mention is made as to why the first waiter left, etc. For any business to be successful, you have to communicate and manage expectations, and Egg Works failed in this one simple transition of wait staff. 

It was our first time (and last), and neither of our two waiters explained the ""egg"" thing (where you have to flip it over to get service). (another failure of communication). 

About our actual food, that was sub-par too. I ordered a waffle works with a waffle, sausage patty, and over easy eggs. My mom ordered a spinach benny. I could've made everything at home and it would've tasted better had I made it at home. Eggs had none of that cooked in buttery goodness that you expect at a restaurant, eggs were underdone even for an over easy because there was still that albumin in there. My waffle was the same kind of waffle you'd make at a continental breakfast at a motel (& dare I say it was worse than a motel waffle). And my sausage was not made on site, as they said it was. It tasted and looked like a jimmy dean frozen sausage microwaved for a minute before being put on my plate. My mothers potatoes were reheated out of a frozen bag. The Canadian ham that came with her eggs benedict had a bone in it!! Gross. Our hot sauce bottles were unopened, so I had to rip off the plastic wrapping (this shows that they don't think about the customer experience, just re-stocking the tables without concern as to how it would affect the customer).

The risotto provided a good balance.

Red and Moxie are the only places that get the done-ness correct 100% of the time (The reason why I'm a regular at Red). These had bacon fingerling potatoes and spiced green beans on the side.

1st time, Wednesday lunch {( 4 star )}

I had the steak salad - one of the best salads I've ever had.  Got me to come back.
Crostini was meh.  But who cares, I was paying for a great salad!

=======================

2nd time was a Sunday at lunch... {( 3 star )}

This time I had the salmon salad.  Not so lucky. Salmon was cooked well (needed salt) but the flavors didn't go we'll together.  The kalamata olives are good but overpowered the fish.   The dressing was oilier than flavorful which was a turn off. I won't be getting the salmon again but will be back to try a shrimp and chicken dish. 

Now, my wife (vegetarian) on the other hand got the acropolis (Greek salad) and loved it.  She already has her next 4 meals here planned. 

The salad prep guy needs a little better memory; he had to ask me and my wife twice (each), only about 45 seconds apart.   He was a little hard to hear, had to ask him to repeat himself. 

Friendly enough service, a little reserved. 

=======================

3rd time, not as good as previous visits {( 2 star... :(  )}

Chicken was bland (like another user experienced) and was closer to fast-food quality.  Dressing wasn't mixed well again - to the point I decided to say something.

There were only 1 or 2 other tables for Sunday lunch around noon, and our party of 4 was seated quickly, but the place had definitely filled up by the time we left.

I ordered the PHO CHAY, while the rest of my table had the house special PHO DAC BIET, the PHO TAI, and the GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN.  I had wanted to try a couple of different things for my first visit using the lunch menu, since it was great that it was available even on a Sunday, but the options were pretty limited--no stir-fries that were Vietnamese style and not a lot of vegetarian options.  Oh well.

I was not in the least disappointed with my vegetarian pho.  It came with plenty of vegetables, and the broth tasted DELICIOUS and very naturally sweet.  I was super impressed with the depth of flavor that they were able to create in a vegetable broth.  In fact, I tried my fiance's beef/tripe broth and actually preferred mine.  We both enjoyed the hell out of our dishes and would definitely repeat.  Our friends, who weren't first-timers here, really liked their food as well.  

Our table was provided a shared plate of the usual garnishes--basil, cilantro, sliced jalapeños, lime wedges, a heaping pile of mung bean sprouts, and culantro, which I've actually never tried before.  Perhaps the prices were a little steep for pho, as others have said, but the portions were so generous that all 3 of us who ordered pho all had significant leftovers.

We received our food fairly quickly, but service was a bit spotty throughout, which was the one subpar area of our experience.  Perhaps it was simply due to the arrival of the lunch rush, but our meal was checked on an excessive number of times in the first few minutes after we received our food, but we had trouble getting the check by the end, even after actively asking for it.  Our server also made it a point to tell us while we were ordering that they didn't have bubble tea--even though none of us mentioned it?  Um...okay?  She also failed to tell me that the tofu in my pho would be fried, which I'm not a fan of and had pointedly asked about.  ""It's soft and fluffy tofu,"" she had told me.  It wasn't.  It was firm, pressed, and fried.  Next.

I know I sound super picky, BUT inconsistent service will never dissuade me from a tasty meal.

the other two sandwiches were forgettable, as were the house-made chips which were greasy, soft, and lacked any flavor (they needed salt).  the sun was beating in on us at 3 in the afternoon and the shades they had in there did little to block it out. our service was spotty, it took about 20 minutes to get our food when the place wasn't that busy. i was rather disappointed in this cute coronado grub spot.",2010-05-30 20:26:20

So I decided to take people's advice and go at 11am, when they first open. I waited outside at around 10:50am, they were nice enough to let people in as it was cold (+1 point for customer service).

The actual ordering didn't start until 11:10am, I wasn't sure why, it seems like the till is connected and stuff. Once I ordered, I waited about 20 minutes for my fried chicken - while there was a line for pickup as well, it's based on order #.

The food itself: I always like Taiwanese fried popcorn chicken, i got the same seasoning, salt & pepper, the chicken was very fresh (I didn't finish all of it at once, the latter part is just the bone, so nothing to eat there). The fried part reminds me of chicken katsu. I also got the drink - curacao pop, I brought the food and drink home to eat, but the pop exploded, luckily nothing was spilled.

We were given the 1 bedroom( without the full kitchen/washer dryer).  As soon as I walked into the room, my service dog Walter found some chicken bones left by the former guest( and not vacuumed up). Well, dogs will be dogs and the next thing you know, I hear crunching.  I walk over and tell him to drop it.  I had to stick my fingers down his throat to pull out the rest.  Unfortunately,  he threw up and had to go outside multiple times that night.  I called down to the front desk, waited on hold for 35 minutes and security was sent up.  He took pics and said 3 more people would come to the room.  I asked to speak to a manager.  No manager ever called me.  Later that night, security saw me coming back from dinner and said he needed to come up to the room to take a report.  He came up at 9pm, after I was in my PJ's.  He insisted that he wait outside my door while I filled out the statement.  OMG!! 

The next day, still not call from management.  I called corporate and waited on hold 30 more min.  They said a manager would call me.  The front desk manager called, offered to pay Walters vet bills( no need for that, he was fine after his upset belly the night before) and that was that.   

The security guard yelled at me in the very dirty hallway, asking me if Walter was a service dog.  I said ' of course, I already checked in and the front desk knows.  I was wearing Walter's ADA ID card around my neck.  I told the guard he should be more concerned about the dirty hallways.  

They did give us some food credit to use at the ""restaurant"".  ( I'll review that separately).  We were required to attend the presentation, but thankfully they let us out after 1 hr.   I told them I'd never buy, not after this horrible experience.  Our ""sales"" advisor tried to make me feel bad by telling me the housekeeper who did not clean the room well enough will probably be fired.  Thanks dude for that.

The updates made to help modernize this location have been a very welcomed addition. Oversized leather chairs that recline? Check. Reserved seating? Check. Great app features to sync your Stubs account, earn rewards, and earn rewards? Check, check and check. I feel like AMC has finally moved into the 21st century with their offerings and features. 

I purchase the $15 annual Stubs Premiere account that gives bonus points on all purchases (earn those $5 cards much faster), plus you get free upgrades on all drink and popcorn sizes. Get a large for medium price, medium for the small prices, etc. This location also has a Premiere members waiting queue for concessions so no waiting when the lines are crazy long and your movie starts in 5 minutes. You can associate your membership to the AMC mobile app- so no card to lose.

Prices are competitive IMO - matinees are cheaper and a great way to save some money with larger groups. There are automated machines to purchase tickets or claim tickets you bought with the app (or online). Makes things a little easier- although the QR scanner on those machines need some help. They rarely work.

For the adults this location serves alcohol. Everything from a cold beer to wine to mixed drinks. They even have ""themed"" drinks in the spirit of movies (i.e.; Margarita of Doom a la Indiana Jones style).  I haven't enjoyed an adult beverage here so no idea on costs- expect a markup though. You can also order fare beyond the popcorn, nachos and candy. There are chicken fingers, pizza and a few other items that looked & smelled pretty good (girl next to me ordered the pizza). 

There are multiple Coke ""mix"" machines to concoct your own invention of soda flavor- or just go with a boring old Coke Classic. There's Icee machines as well- we like to get the kid's package that includes a small drink, popcorn and fruit candies- then fill the cup with Icee. 

Parking is easy, there are lots of lunch/dinner choices within walking distance if you want a meal before/after the movie. The Living Room is a great drinks and apps place literally next door to the AMC front doors.

We have a checklist of what makes a pho restaurant good: obviously the pho broth has to be flavourful (not fatty) and has to be clean tasting. They have to either have at least good shrimp rolls or spring rolls. The vegetables must be fresh and not browning or wilting. They should offer some kind fresh tasting fruit shake or bubble tea. My husband has to have cilantro, Thai basil, three hot chilli peppers (the little ones) and fresh lime. Surprisingly, not all Pho restaurants offer these side toppings. So, this might be a hefty list but that's the ultimate package for us. We'll even take not-so-friendly customer service over the overly nice Canadian service if it means the food is top notch! 


This place has high reviews and good feedback so we tried it out first. I really, really wanted to like this place and it seemed to all get off on the right foot with our server, who was a young girl. She brought us tea and menus right away and was friendly. The extra crispy and fresh bean sprouts and super juicy fresh shrimp roll (some places really skimp out on the noodles in the roll or the rice paper is really dry, not the case with this place!).. but then the pho came out and it looked proper but the broth was missing that ""kick"". It also had a slight smell of wet rag, which usually means the beef hasn't been stored properly or there's too much fat in the broth. Either way, it's not the best broth we've had. I didn't mind it so much since the bean sprouts were super fresh (that's always a sign that they're getting fresh ingredients in) and the shrimp roll was one of the best I've ever had. Then I ordered a mango shake to go and it tasted so sour! I'm not sure if the milk had gone bad or if the frozen fruit/ powder made it taste that way but I had to take it back and let the kitchen know. 

TLDR; the bean sprouts are fresh and the shrimp rolls are one of the best but the pho broth and mango shake were not up to standard.

We also enjoy their zucchini fries with ranch, a lot...but I've had them three different times and each time have been different. Time number 2 was absolutely the best but I can't put my finger on what is happening different. This place is usually fairly busy and it can make service a bit impersonal and a smidgen slow but we've always gotten everything out without too long of a wait. I've also tried one of their shakes but honestly, can't really remember what it was so it wasn't too memorable. Overall, a great, casual place for lunch or dinner. Love the patio too!",2013-10-29 00:47:37

The guys and gals that work their are way nice and the soy in the latte is really good, I have to find out which kind they use.  

Oh ya and they are superfast, they have given me my  debit card back, stamped my punch card and gave me my coffee in less than a minute, I swear.

The person who brought my food wasn't paying attention to what she was doing and as she was trying to quickly put the plates down dumped my plate on me.  It was hot but no damage done.  They got another plate out to me very quickly.  Made me wonder why the original order took so long though.

Food, o.k....but that's Mexican to me... it's all kind of the same stuff, not a lot of differences.  Good amount of meat in the flautas I got.  Rice, normal.  I didn't eat the beans...those always look gross to me.  Brown beans, not black beans.  

Nice, thin tortilla chips.  Yum.  Could have made a meal off of those and almost did.  They don't have queso blanco, just the yellow cheese queso, it was good and there was plenty of it.  

The guacamole though...that was exemplary!  Nice and chunky and a good helping of it.  

My friend got the crispy taco plate.  It looked good, but the taco's were small, but seemed to have a good amount of meat as well!  Made me wonder what the Thursday mini soft taco's must look like though - teeny-tiny?

Barefoot Wines $4.75/glass...now that's a good deal!!!!  Merlot is nice and fruity.

Decor is fine...colorful, vintage-styled ""portraits""...not sure what Elvis had to do with any of it, but there ""HE"" is.  

Pet peeve...why do restaurants seat from the back of the house?  They started to take me down some hallway past the restrooms and I turned around and asked them to seat me in a booth closer to the front.

This location is pretty good. Today they forgot one of our tacos and that was disappointing. Yes, it was only a $1 taco but who doesn't want their order to be correct? Plus the drive thru attendant wasn't very friendly and was a bit weird. He asked to see our ID with the credit card, totally understandable, but then meticulously checked the ID to a point where it felt like he thought we were thieves. Usually a quick check of name on the ID and a photo comparison does the trick but nope he did more than that. Just strange.

Well I can assure you that all of that and so much more is in every Fern Dish. They season their food very well but its not over powering either.

Their customer service tonight was a little more off than usual. Could have had something to do with how busy they were. They are always pretty busy so I don't know why tonight one of our servers was a mess. We were waiting for him to go over the sake menu with us and when he came up, he asked us if we were ready to order drinks and we said ""no, could you please"" and he grabbed the sake menu, placed it in front o us and then walked away. Another server saw and heard how offended we were and sat down and helped us with our drink order. 

The other server was back and hovered over the server taking our drink order. Once the server that took our drink order walked away, our original server looked ready to run away again, but since I've been here before I was ready to order for the my party of three. We started with:

edamame
calamari tempura
pot stickers
seaweed salad
shirmp/scallop 
black dragon
vegas roll
rainbow roll
shrimp lover roll
cinderella roll
arizona roll

I ordered all the food at once and it all came out at once. All of our order was out in about 15 minutes. There wasn't one thing that our table wasn't happy with. Everything was fresh. Nice, flavorful pieces of eel on black dragon roll. They were out of the white Tuna so we ordered squid, octopus, tuna, and red snapper nigiri which was a taste that just tastes clean and fresh.  

At one point the absent minded server took our drinks to refill and never returned with our drinks. We asked another server for drinks and we still never got them. 

We had green tea ice cream and mochi to finish. It was delicious as usual. 

This was a great visit because we got our food so fast. The customer service could use some work.

Went friday and saturday and the lineup was great. Past years theyve had way better lineups: KOL, hozier, the killers, etc. this year was j. Cole, geazy, empire of the sun, bloc party - all amazing!! I love how there are different stages so its never completely crowded. If you go about 30 minutes to a stage before a big artist you can get to the front no problem. VIP tix seem like a sham. My friends and I made buddies who came from out of state just to attend and even met a guy all the way from France!

If you dont want people smoking cigarettes and weed in your face or spilling their drinks on your shoes then this place isnt for you. Also went to the saturday comedy show and they were pretty good. One guy, who was the host and on Conan, was hilarious. The other 3 kind of sucked and they were pretty aggressive but there were rude people in the audience. 

The food options are also great. Drinks are overpriced. Great company, great art, great music, and an awesome experience! I hope they have a good lineup next year. 

My advice to LIB is to offer more, free shuttle service and for god sake make the stage screens higher. One stage didnt even have screens.

So far have only had hash bowl and veggie bowl.  Both very healthy and what I found to be delicious as well.  Now one has to remember that the veggie hash bowl is all about the veggies and kale, so you might want to ask for extra creamy avocado for a bit more wetness.

Food: We had the truffle fries: Excellent! not too truffly to overwhelm. We went with the classic Pepperoni x-cheese & sauce: perfection - Just like my favorite NYC brick oven pizza. The right amount of crust to topping ratio. Not a tough dough, just a good chew. We want to go back to try some of their specialties like the   SPACCA NAPOLI or the Picante. Tiramisu: just the right amount of soaked ladyfingers to alcohol. 5****

Drinks: We were excited to see bacon bloody Marys on the menu. *if you follow me, you know i'm the queen of bloody Marys in Vegas* so of course we ordered 2. Nicely garnished with a very nice hearty piece of perfectly cooked bacon (not some floppy end under cooked piece* and a seasoned rim. Then we tested it. heavy aftertaste in the bloody Mary mix.

Having known the family of this establishment my whole life, I can personally attest to their devotion to their food, the customers and the atmosphere.  The Garcia family first hit a home run with their original deli location at Christown Mall.  When they moved out of Christown they opened up a pair of locations with huge fanfare both at the Colonade and at Arrowhead Mall.  To be honest, I didn't think the Colonade would do all that well as they were invisible from Camelback Road.  Little did I know the following this place had.  Everytime I've gone the place has been jumping.  And rightfully so.

When you walk in you immediately notice the fun color scheme as well as how clean it looks.  The aroma from the hot line is as alluring as you'd expect.  No waiters or reservations here.  Just hop in line and order your dish from the cooks as they make it right in front of you.

My tried and true favorite is the brisket sandwich on kaiser bread with a side of fruit and a slice of one of their fresh pies to boot.  Sometimes I'll grab some pastrami or corn beef as an alternative.  They've also got burgers and kosher hot dogs if you prefer.  Other sides include chili, fries, mac and cheese, or one of a number of soups.  The food is delicious but simple.  And whatever you order, you'll feel like you're in a New York style deli (without the NY attitude of course).

So why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Well for one, this hip deli near the Biltmore area isn't cheap.  True, you get what you pay for, but I couldn't afford to eat here everyday.  A good meal here usually runs around $15 -$20 so just be aware of that.  Also, this place is wicked busy, especially during dinner.  Usually you can find a seat, but it can get pretty noisy in there.  Don't let this scare you away though.  Especially if you live in the central Phoenix area.  Alot of the folks who eat here are people from the neighborhood so its highly possible you'll run into someone you know.  If you're on the west side, their location at Arrowhead Mall won't disappoint either.  

Let's give props to the folks at Miracle Mile.  This small family operation has grown by leaps and bounds over the years, but you'd never know it talking to the owners.  The same humble attention to good food, a good atmosphere, and a neighborhood following still holds strong after all these years.  Success clearly hasn't changed this family recipe.",2008-08-25 22:21:18

My favorite dish here has been the Eric burrito, however I do wish it was bigger since it's on the smaller side. I also like the Suzie's Chicken Sandwich for lunch. If you are looking for a healthier option, the DJ's So Cal Low Cal and the Shi's Super Food Scramble are pretty good and filling. 

The worst dish I had here was the Queen Maggie French Toast. Inside the flat pieces of bread were several chunks of plain cream cheese. I had to take them all out since I don't know anyone who would want to eat a whole package of plain cream cheese between two pieces of grilled bread. If it was a cheesecake mixture, it would have been much more palpable.

From the wooden tables to the little potted plants to the pretty ceiling lights and cute wall installations, everything just screams Pinterest! It's very welcoming and cozy.

We ordered the takoyaki to start. It was a bit hard on the outside. There was a decent amount of octopus on the inside, but the batter was a bit too dense for my liking. Overall, the takoyaki was quite bland; more takoyaki sauce also could've been added for a richer taste.

Then, I had the chicken karaage rice. For such a seemingly small bowl, I was surprised by the amount of chicken in it. It also came with a soft-boiled egg (which was cold.. would've preferred it warm), edamame, pickled ginger, and a slice of cantaloupe. The chicken was tender and there wasn't too much batter. But again, even with the mayo drizzled overtop, it tasted a bit bland. The rice was a bit overcooked and dry.

My friend ordered the gyu udon. I enjoyed the udon a lot more than the rice, since it was chewy and tasty with the soup base seeped into the noodles. This dish was also served with a cantaloupe in the bowl - not sure if having a fruit drowned in soup is the best idea!

My wife and I decided to give it another chance and we have since become fans.  They offer a good happy hour and the meals are enough to split between two people. 

I would definitely recommend the ""Artichoke Heaven"" or ""TMI Toast"" as a starter.  Any sandwich you pick should not disappoint, my favorite's are ""The Sheridan"" and the ""RB & C.""  I would recommend the greens as your side, the dressing is delicious.  

My favorite is that I can take it back to the old school and order a Mickey's wide mouth hand grenade as a beverage.  There beer list is quite extensive and they have many local brews on tap, along with other fine beverages.

I have eaten here twice and have found the food to be good, but not consistent. There are things on the menu I that are good and there are things that aren't. 

The Baked Goat Cheese ($10.95) - Okay this is yummy. But it's an appetizer...and it's $11. But it's goat cheese, but it's an appetizer.....but it's good, so get it anyway. This I enjoyed and would've ate it by the boat load.

Publican's Reuben ($10.95) -('o'-) Oh my gosh look at that. My Reuben was the same price as my dang appetizer!  Haha. The Reuben was sadly not that great, the bread was soggy, and it was missing some more much needed sauerkraut. It just didn't have the tang or crunch I was looking for. The meat was a bit dry and bland as well.

My friend had the Fish & Chips Regular portion ($13.95). He said they were good, but could've been crispier. I'm not sure if the batter was exactly his favorite.

The first time I went to Ri Ra's with a group I had the Guinness BBQ Burger ($10.95) I liked this - yummy onion rings and Guinness BBQ sauce on top.

However, this last time I was there, while talking to the man who greeted me, I checked out the back seat to make sure there wasn't anything valuable there.  I realized I had a purse and receipt in a bag that I was going to return to the store.  So, I opened the trunk and tossed it in there along with all the other things such as blankets, a cat carrier, books, hiking shoes, etc.  I told him they would not be cleaning my trunk. I actually have told them that every time without any trouble. The next day, I drove to the store to return the purse.  Parked my car,  opened the trunk, and realized it wasn't there.  I knew immediately that it was stolen at the car wash.

I could call the business and file a report.  They would probably try to make it up to me by giving me free car washes.  That worked out great for me some years ago when at another location, I realized they had stolen my MP3 player.  However, I have decided I'm just done with this car wash company.

Please keep in mind that this is one time out of probably 15 visits.  Chances are, nothing will get stolen.  Especially if you are diligent in taking everything of value out of your car.  Personally, I can't see myself going through all of that hassle since I have my glove box, and other little storage compartments in the car, full of papers, sunglasses, gum, etc.  Not to mention the items in my trunk.

You will park at the Icebox Canyon trailhead, just past Willow Spring on the loop road. Approaches start on a good trail leading south from the parking lot.

This trail is about only three miles round trip and has very little elevation gain. Imo, an easy moderate hike. It starts out as a regular trail on the valley floor, then descends in to a wash that heads deep into the canyon. There are quite a lot of hikers here as it's a popular hike esp in the hot months.

In the wash there are many small boulders that you must be climbed over or around. They do make a great introduction to scrambling! At the back of the canyon we saw a couple of permanent pools and a seasonal waterfall.

We went here for the hubs bday last month. My boss is a big foodie and I asked him what his top 5 fav restaurants in Phx/Scottsdale were and Roka was on that list. So the hubs, his parents and I went. 

We had reservations to sit at the grill bar so we could watch all the action.

There was a lot of backlash about the theme of this cafe ever since it was announced, but I think that was really petty of people to be harassing the owner. I thought the idea of a poop cafe was interesting because while it may be more common in Asia, it's really the first of its kind here. I had originally thought it would be more like a restaurant, it ended up being a dessert cafe. 

The pros of this place is that it really is toilet themed. You sit on top of toilets, you drink out of urinal shaped cups, you eat from toilet bowls. The walls are covered in little poop pictures and jokes. The bar where they make the food is a toilet bowl and the light fixtures are plungers. It's just cute allover when it comes to the theme.

Alas, the cons of this place are the prices. It really is overpriced for what they're selling. I wouldn't mind so much if the portions were bigger, but you have a waffle the size of my palm (and I have small hands) for three dollars. The matcha bingsu I ordered was around $8.50 but it wasn't that great either. The menu said gelato but it was ice cream (though there was mochi so that was a pleasant surprise). It was my first time having bingsu, and it was a little disappointing. 

Service is a bit scattered, but that might also be because the food is on one level while all the seating is on another. Servers are trying to run around but the place is a little cramped (I hit my head on a light three times). They are friendly though, so I will give them that.

The problem that I had with the restaurant is that the menu was very limited and to make a long drive for hot dog and fresh cut fries, although tasty, just wasn't worth it.  Additionally, paying $15 or so for said hot dog and fries just wasn't worth the effort.  Hey, I can go get a pack of high quality hot dogs and a couple of potatoes and feed a horde for the same price.  Would I have the same accoutrements?  Not necessarily, but close enough!

That leads me to the re-opening of the same space as The Fire Side Public House.  Now, my cousin told me that the new owners were having a ""soft opening"" and that I should get there quickly.  (I have been eyeballing the opening of this place for quite some time, so I hightailed it over there and I called my fellow Yelper Tim W. to let him in on the soft opening secret.)

The ambiance of the place is literally ""smoky hipster-chic"".  (They have a show kitchen centered around a Grillworks oven.   The owners also own Sidelines Beer House in Sewickley, which opened in 2012, and Sidelines Bar & Grille in Millvale, ) The menu includes sandwiches, burgers, small plates and entrees.  I have actually been to the restaurant/pub on two different occasions and they're barely open, so be a little patient with them.  On my first occasion, I had the grilled Siracha Maple Bacon wings and my daughter Muff had the Smoked Chicken Nachos as appetizers.  The wings were delicious and cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was that they actually came AFTER my entrée.  (That's a timing issue that the chefs have to work out.)  My daughter enjoyed her nachos and I thought that they were good, but I think that they can be GREAT if they truly ""smoke"" the chicken ahead of time and then heat it/sear it right before serving.

Now to the entrees!  I had the Blue Corn Shrimp & Grits and my daughter had the Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken.  I am a shrimp & grit connoisseur!  The Fire Side's shrimp & grit dish was tasty.  Wood-fired Cajun seasoned shrimp over blue corn grits with an over easy egg?  Shoooot!  Sign me up!  Minor complaint?  Yes!  I love almost any type of shrimp in any form or fashion, but peeling grilled head-on shrimp after they have been ""stuck"" in grits is not a pleasant experience.  Lose the shrimp ""body"" shell, keep the head on and grill away! (They have another shrimp dish that is prepared similarly, ""Smoked Prawns"",that is better served by this style of preparation because the diner is not asked to dip their hands into grits to enjoy the shrimp.)  Muff's Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken needed a dose of additional seasoning/sauce to enhance the dish.
The desserts that we had, Campfire S'Mores and Blueberry Cobbler served in cast iron pans were delicious.  The S'Mores dish needed a little more graham crackers and the chocolate needs to be placed on top of the crackers and not at the bottom of the pan. (Burned the chocolate in spots.)  Blueberry Cobbler?  Yummy!  They should change the cobbler seasonally.

On my second occasion, we had their signature Fire Side burger, Smoked Prawns, Beer Cheese & Bacon Fries and Chicken Skillet Pasta.  All of these dishes were decent and the service on both occasions was excellent.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant.

Was everything excellent?  No, but they are definitely heading in the right direction.  Once they tweak and refine a couple of the dishes, (E.g., The beer cheese sauce was way too thin) they will definitely be worthy of 5 stars, in my humble opinion.  They have all of the makings (I.e., Reasonable price points, tasty menu offerings, great service) of a five star pub, just give them a moment to get their bearings.  We need this type of place in the East End where you can leisurely enjoy tasty food and drinks without competing in expensive parking Olympics.",2015-11-20 19:28:48

All the pasta dishes are great -- if you love bacon try the Pasta Carbonara. It's my go-to dish here for the moment. My pass favorites include Chicken Bellagio and the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes. 

I've had a few sandwiches here -- the club and the cheesesteak. I don't really like the cheesesteak, it just doesn't have that delicious steak and cheese combination flavors like Corleones. However, the club is one of my favorite club sandwiches found anywhere and it's particularly good on a really hot Arizona day with an iced tea or a coke. 

The service is always great -- friendly and personable -- and they seem to have the timing down of when to check-up on the table.

One of my favorite things about the Cheesecake Factory is their hours: they are open super late for the area, 11:00PM on weekdays and 12:00AM Thursday through Saturday. 

One downside is I really don't like their alcoholic drinks. They are really strong (as in not blended right) and taste like they use super cheaper liquor. 

Oh and breakfast: not good here. I had the breakfast sandwich made with french toast and bacon. It sounded amazingly delicious but it was so gross I didn't even want to it. Something about cheese and french toast just didn't go together well for me.

Their terminal for inputting names is pretty much self explanatory and you can designate who gets bumpers when its their turn. Lol, bumpers are not just for kids! Their tables have nice chairs that swivel so you can turn to see the action. Lots of space to walk around as well.

For you peeps that tend to get hungry when you bowl, they have a decent café that serves hotwings, fries, burgers, and hot dogs. They also have a bar for those that tend to bowl better when they are buzzed. I guess confidence goes a long way.

The only thing negative I can point out is that since people show up late at night to bowl and if they get enough alcohol in them, they tend to act stupid. Good thing they have enough security. The times I have been going there really hasn't been any serious issues except for drunk people falling over and dropping bowling balls.

Limited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.

POLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.

Mains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. 

The recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.

Breakfast has some western items (toast/eggs/homefries) and some typical Hk cafe items (eg Spam with fried egg on vermicelli, pork bun sandwich). Afternoon tea menu has some of the morning selections as well. 

I'm usually not a huge fan of Chinese style Portuguese sauce anything, but their Portuguese curry fish on bun was so fragrant and tasty. Though not as fluffy as the buns in Macau, Woodstone's buns are soft and chewy enough compared to Macau style buns at other cafes. 

The beef brisket here is so tender and has flavour, unlike many other HK cafe. Totally worth getting as well for breakfast or afternoon tea. 

Their BBQ pork (char siu) in tomato sauce and melted cheese with a fried egg on top was amazing. The tangy and sweet flavours of the tomato BBQ sauce with the egg yolk mixed in was perfect on a bed of steamed rice. 

Their milk tea is served in cups larger than most other HK cafe cups. The milk and tea combination is just right. Trust, I have tried enough milk tea in GTA - some tastes like brown coloured evaporated milk, some tastes like watered down tea, some tastes way too bitter. I like their hot milk tea, but I don't think I would order their iced milk tea again because from the granules I saw at the bottom of my cup, their iced versions seemed to have been prepared from instant milk tea powder instead! :( 

The price is a bit on the higher side but the seating environment is comfortable.

We got there twenty minutes before they opened, but the lady opened up shop to take our order. We caused some mayhem and created a slew of followers to join us. I am grateful, but feel bad. Be sure to come after 1 o'clock.

For a regular custard add blueberries, it cost me a little over three dollars and was more than enough.

My noodles were good, but they were the premade style noodle, the wide variety of vegetables and texture of tofu really made this dish shine, I really like the skinny green beans and thai basil.  The springroll was a bit cool and soggy, I think this is what we get for coming a bit late for lunch. The portion size was quite good, making the higher price acceptable.

There are places like this everywhere, but do our pieologists have what it takes to break the mold? 

This is the thinnest thin crust I have ever seen. Anywhere. It's not necessarily crunchy, either, but hard, rubbery, and tasteless. It's like a minimalist vessel that simply acts as a delivery system for delicious toppings. In their defense, however, some pizzas are surprisingly low in calories. Half of one was good enough for me...and that logged in less than 500! Not bad. 

I was craving spicy, so I went with the buffalo chicken pizza...this is the best buffalo pizza I've had! I was worried there wouldn't be enough sauce, but whatever they're using is actually spicy. Really gets the job done. Cheese is high quality, and so was the chicken. 

I tried their side of ""savory herb strips"", a vague name I'm sure some legal team came up with because there is no way these can pass as real breadsticks. Coated with oregano, way too much olive oil, and just the right amount of minced garlic, these were a reminder that the crust is unorthodox. So rubbery, they were quite difficult to pull apart! The marinara on the side was boring! I wouldn't waste the calories on these again. 

I can't imagine the crust would hold up heftier toppings, and while I'll try a traditional pie from here, I'm not sure how enjoyable it will be. At the very least, this place is really really good at one item I crave, and that's a-ok with me.",2015-08-22 05:02:58

So what does Southwest Airline have control over? I think it is only fair to review a business or in this case a flight for the things they actually have control over.

For example; the rude woman who wanted to sit next to me, while I attempted to explain that my wife was sitting there wasn't Southwest's fault - that woman should just be thrown from the moving aircraft!

They also cannot really control whether the ride is smooth or bumpy - though I do believe they could try to avoid some of the big bumps when I need to pee so badly and am not allowed to get up because of the turbulence. 

Finally, the cannot control the passenger who has a horrible allergic condition of peanuts - so badly that the flight became a peanut free flight! However, I still had to eat my protein bar, which had nuts in it - but then again - I have to eat what I have to eat so my BS doesn't drop and I take precedence over the nut issue!

However, they DO have control over their flight attendants and this flight was no different then most others on Southwest. Though I have been with better - they had a good sense of humor - one in which my son didn't fully grasp, but then again he wasn't looking forward to going back home to WNY from Scottsdale AZ!  Steve was perhaps the best of the crew!

The aircraft appeared clean - it was a new one for sure 737 so they get a star for that. Otherwise - it's pretty much a basic seen it all before flight! I like upgrades to First Class!

Perhaps I was a bit too kind - I am changing this review from 2 stars down to 1 because this flight attendant is just too darn sarcastic and rude! she should be thrown out of the aircraft at 30,000 feet with the other rude biotch!

Just when you think it won't get worse - we land in Buffalo only to find out that most everyone's luggage is still in Phoenix - I was lucky - my family got two out of six bags - we only have four bags left in Phoenix. Thank you Southwest for making this trip and my families vacation one to remember!",2013-04-13 19:10:46

Started at the bar for one of the amazing drinks, the bar tender was inattentive although there was only one other couple there, didn't acknowledge us for quite some time.
When we were seated to eat, no one came to acknowledge us for a very loooong time, finally after awhile they brought water but the waitress didn't 'pop over' and no one offered to open our wine for at least 10 min...the restaurant was not busy so that couldn't have been the reason.
I ordered the Big Eye Tuna Tartare which was AMAZING and the Sea Bass which was so delicious and tasty that when it was gone I wished there was more!
My friends both ordered the tasting menu which included the entree of the Waygu Steak but the waitress didn't ask how they wanted it cooked.  One came perfectly med rare, the other well done and then we couldn't find anyone to come back to fix it!  I was waiving my arm in the air and a waiter walked RIGHT BY the table!  Another waiter (not ours) did come to our rescue and fixed it quickly and while later our waitress finally showed up to see how we were doing.
And no one payed attention to our wine glasses being empty so I reached into the bucket to get our bottle and pour when one of the busboys came over and did it.
After dessert we sat and sat and sat and sat waiting for the waitress to come back so we could request the check...

I went with a group of 8 people can left dismayed and disappointed. The ambiance was very chic, simplistic, and quiet tranquil. There were two sushi men, one who was the main guy at Sushimon then Goyemon and another Japanese guy. I was pleased to see all Japanese sushi chefs :) 

We were all sat at their back table. There were also two Japanese female servers. We all ordered the Nigiri Course ($48) and were thrilled to start the  edomae sushi presentation. We were first presented with a pinapple flavored sake accompanied by  a small appetizer with fresh grated wasabi, okra, 3 cubs of lean tuna (from Spain), thin slices of cucumber and seaweed. It was good and you can taste the high quality of the tuna. The second, third, and fourth presenation was followed by an assortment of 9 pieces of nigiri. Of the assortment several pieces were delicious like the parrot fish, sweet lips, stripped pig (sounds exotic huh?!). If you have been a fan of Sushimon and Goyemon you will notice that there were many cuts of fish that you cannot find at any other sushi place. However compared to the pieces that were given at the bar, we found our pieces of fish so thin and very little rice. After the end of your nigiri dishes the server asks if you would like to purchase or order any additional fish. Keep in mind our party of 8 was divided into 2 tables. My friend and I (sitting at separate tables)  ordered the fresh sweet shrimp (so plump, lightly sweet, and tender). I repeated the order 3 separate times to the server to make sure that she understands. However,  she still had some confusion and two pieces were given to my friend at the other table. I asked the server I had also ordered one and she said it was coming out. She said that since the shrimp was large, they cut the shrimp in half and made two pieces. Well one of those pieces, turned out, was supposed to be mine. While I was waiting for my piece  (ten mins), I was getting so impatient because another couple who had entered later then us were already done.  I yelled at the server and asked her when i was getting my sweet shrimp! She said 'the other piece was yours!'..... OMG!!!! #1) if we were all given separate plates for our orders, why would you place two pieces on one plate #2) we sat at separate tables so why would they we together on one plate?! Our whole course took an unnecessary 2 1/2 hours. We were waiting almost 20 between each course, yet they were quick to take our plates :( 

Okay, my review is turning into a disaster and I really didnt want to write this review because we truly do love and support Sushimon & Goyemon..... my boyfriend and I go at least once every few weeks :( 

Before you go, here are some helpful tips in order to get your $48 worth 
#1. Do not go in big groups (bigger than 4) because you will get sat at a table. The $48 you pay isnt just for the high quality sushi but you are buying the whole experience; like interacting with the sushi chef, seeing your fish being cut, etc. 

#2. When you make reservations, ask to be sat at the sushi bar

#3. While the fish was spectacular, the pieces were so small. You will leave hungry so many stop by Monta Noodle for a snack to fill you up :) 

#4. The dessert was fabulous! My boyfriend and I ordered homemade mochi ice cream (peanut butter, green tea, citrus) and strawberry crepe cake (7 layers of crepe). Highly recommend these two items! 

#5. Remember this is not an AYCE place so don't expect to leave full! You are paying for the edomae sushi  experience and the fish that is flown in from Japanese. 

After this whole disaster, my boyfriend and I will give this place another try. Hopefully after following our own tips, we will have a better experience! : )",2012-05-31 17:00:28

If I were to list all of the food they brought us (it's so much more than what you order) this review would be a few pages long, so I'll resist and give you what you need to know. 

This is a beautiful restaurant - very classy and romantic setting. The service is impeccable. Everyone is friendly, polite and patient (describing dishes again and again) and our server was also hilarious, with a very dry sense of humour. 

Not all of the food ranks with the most delicious I've ever had, though it's all very tasty, but the creativity and artistry with which it's presented is... well it's just really something else. Once you've had a book that lets out a cloud of fragrant wood smoke brought to you to find a single piece of gravlax on lemon cream in a pastry shell inside, you can't really think of a cooler way to have salmon served to you. 

Favourite dishes of the many we were brought were the tagliatelle of calamari and the lobster cream cappuccino. The madeleines and macarons we were served with dessert were also exceptionally good.

LA Pastrami is definitely ranked pretty high on this list of pastrami mecca's. The only way to eat this tender cured sliced beef is simple in my opinion. On a french roll with mustard, pickles,  and cheese. Easy.

My sandwich today was perfect. A satisfying half pound portion of thinly sliced steamed meat piled high on a soft roll with mustard and pickles. Just like I described above.  Excellent! The meat was sliced perfect to stay tender and not over cooked to make it chewy or tough. 

LA Pastrami has a ton of other items they serve on the menu I must try. Burgers, fries, homemade ice cream and the list goes on and on. I did not expect such a list of offerings from this little run down pastrami hut.

The choice of noodles that I went with was the green tea noodle. Was it tasty? Yes it was tasty but the serving amount was enough for my 2 year grand daughter. I like the the concept of picking my own ingredients, which there was quite a selection to chose from. My husband wasn't too thrilled with the idea to begin with and he's still not thrilled with this place. Then we had to go pick our own condiments and appetizers from the bar. Let's just say they need to keep that area a little bit more tidier than it was. Choice of appetizers were limited to 2. They do have a conveyor belt around the general sitting area but since we were in a large group we were sat in a private room. They take your broth order first and once that arrives, the waiter comes in and takes the rest of your order. He takes everyone's order except for one of my friends. We had to go and find the waiter to finish hers. Then we asked for forks for a couple people and took me asking twice before we even got it. After all
the orders arrived, we realized everyone got theirs except for my husband and my friend, who's order they originally forgot to take.

Our party ordered their famous fried chicken, biscuits & gravy and brisket sliders to share amongst everyone. We also ordered mac and cheese along with their corn bread to pair with our entrees. The fried chicken was served hot out of the fryer and it was absolutely delicious! I believe our waiter mentioned their chickens are brined for 27 hours which explains the moistness behind every bite. The skin wasn't as crunchy as I expected but it was still nonetheless flavorful and good. The biscuits with gravy and eggs was a bit... messy. The egg was cooked over easy and the yolk sort of made everything else on the dish a little soggy. I know most people probably enjoy the combination of biscuits, chicken and eggs mixture; it was just a bit too much for me. The corn bread was good, but I definitely had better. The Mac and cheese was creamy, but it could have used a little more cheddar cheese to add that sharpness flavor to it. 

Overall, I really had a good dining experience here and would recommend others to try this place out. Really cool ambiance with couches and love sofas available for seating. They also have a full bar if you wanted to just chill and have a drink with your friends.

Now I'm not the biggest crepe fan in the world (usually a little too sweet for me), but this place has plenty of tasty options, with a wide variety of coffees, beers, and wines.  

It's a solid place for a coffee date with some inventive food options.  The decor is stylish stone and slightly darkened.  I was there for breakfast, but it seemed like a decent, slightly quirky choice for a first date.

The crepes themselves are light and airy pancakes made mostly from eggs.  They're a classic option in French and Swiss breakfasts, but Crepe Expectations has taken the classic crepe and fused in a colorful variety of filling options.  

While I was there, I started off with the Sonora.  We're in the SW and I wanted to know what the French crepe filled with filled with flank steak, fresh avocado and cheese would taste like.  The steak was properly cooked and still tender but I'm not sure if the Sonora is a great dish overall.  The steak is heavy and I appreciate a filling meal, but the crepe made the dish feel more like a wet burrito.  I loved the contents, just wasn't won over by the combination of crepe and burrito filling.

I also had the Avalon--a crepe filled with goat cheese, honeyed pear and walnuts.  Dear god that is sweet.  A little too sweet.  I loved the consistency of the walnuts and the softened pears, but the honeyed pear completely overwhelmed the tartness in the goat cheese.  That said, I want to love this crepe.  Even sitting here, I want to reach back into the past and dial back the honey on the crepe.  When I took matters into my own hands, controlled what was on my fork, and made sure there was plenty of goat cheese, it was a really wonderful flavor combination.  

The coffee was well-roasted and rich.  And they had nice little touches, like offering cucumber water and lemon water with the meal.  The beer and wine menu had some nice small brewery/small winery options and I'm a big fan of this place.  All in all, Crepe Expectations has earned a firm spot in my brunch rotation.

Based on the food, this place gets a solid 3.5 stars.  Inventive menu--that's pretty close to delicious even if the flavors were a little too sweet for me or a little off in my opinion.  The food was still prepared expertly and I do like imagination in a menu.  I threw in the extra .5 star because the staff is very welcoming and helpful.

My initial impression of the hotel when I walked in was that it looked pretty cool. I loved the ceiling of the casino area. It's quite nice how many details are created to resemble Paris. The check in counter was beautiful with all the chandeliers. 

So why 4 stars and not 5? I felt that the hotel was disorganized in their booking system and this affected the check in process. On the night my party arrived, we went to the express machines at check-in but they weren't working. So we lined up and there weren't many counter representatives so the line was quite long. Can't really complain since I know it's Vegas and other hotels could be just as busy.

My issue with the checkin is because my room was not available ... and I arrived at 11pm which is wayyyy later than the allowed check in time so my room should already be prepared. My room was booked ahead of time online. They did not prepare a room. Why was it not ready? How can a hotel like this be so disorganized? The staff who was checking my party in had to check the system which rooms were available at the price we paid. So we waited ...  then she tells us there is a room available with one king bed. But we booked a room with TWO beds, two queen beds. She said both rooms are about the same price. But it's not about the price. This is about customer needs. We (customers) paid for a room with 2 queen beds. If they overbooked a standard room then they should offer an upgraded room with 2 queen beds, not another room with 1 bed. I'm confused why she thinks we would take that offer when we paid for a room with 2 beds. 

Anyways. She made a call to see if there were any rooms left with two queen beds (which we booked and paid for in advance) and there was. So we got our room finally.

I was disappointed how can Paris hotel not have an available room which was booked and paid for. You would expect their system is accurate and they would not have such issues. 

Other than the horrible check in process, I think the hotel is nice. The housekeeping staff are friendly and they did a great job. I hope they improve on their check in process.",2017-08-31 06:41:25

My friend ordered the Rodizio all-you-can-eat meat circular, where they come to your table with skewered meats such as chicken, lamb, filet mignon, prime rib, etc.  If you want seafood you order from a more expensive but similar all-you-can-eat circular.  The cost was $38.99 for the Rodizio.  I ordered a grilled season chicken and fries for $28.99 that was good, but way too much food.  Which was the problem.

They don't keep a close eye on you here.  I was eating the extra meat from my friends extra plate the entire time waiting for my chicken.  By the time it arrived, I was full!  I should've not used the coupon and ordered an appetizer and snacked on the filet mignon coming around all night!

The meats were excellent as far as taste and presentation: I really enjoy them coming to the table with freshly grilled meat.  I would come here again for a special occassion such as birthday or something, but it is a little too expensive to eat here as often as I eat out.",2010-01-20 21:35:15

Accommodations were modern. Bedside tablet to control Everything in the room: lights, TV, curtains, temperature, room service, reservations, you name it! Bathroom was spacious with a room for a bathtub and a separate shower in one room. Every room has a corner view: even though that ""corner"" is about 2ft wide on one side, it is surprisingly enough to get a great view from every room!

The décor and setup is unique and did it's job for me making the restaurant look clean, fresh, cute and comfortable. 

The waitresses were attentive & respectful and although initially forgetting to bring us our utensils, responded quickly and kindly to our request. I noticed them making frequent rounds around the restaurant.

The menu itself is simple. Udons and Dons with either beef, chicken, pork or seafood. (Just like in Japan!) We ordered a few Dons and takoyaki balls. The Dons were unique, topped with some fruit + edamane in addition to what you'd typically expect. The downside was the portions which I found a bit light (borderline acceptable for the cost at ~$9...) Perhaps they should consider a large size? This is what a lot of places in Japan do. The takoyaki balls were crispy, with a generous portion of octopus. I would have liked a bit more sauce on ours.

Some ordered the grilled cheese, the bad breath burger and the ace burger. All burgers are grass fed with Wisconsin cheese. My friends said they were just ok. Not enough seasoning on the burger.

On our last trip we dined here again and it was just as good as we remembered.  Reservations are usually not hard to get within a few days or hours of your visit, but if you have a large group be sure and make one.  The bar area is our favorite place to sit because it's a little quieter and brighter than a table in the back of the restaurant itself, and the bartenders and cocktail waitresses always have the best service skills!  The full menu is available in the bar, so you don't miss out on anything and actually get a pretty good view of the Casino to keep you entertained during your meal.

The food is always excellent, and this visit was no exception.  Guacamole was on point - creamy but with a little texture from the fresh tomatoes and onions, a perfect way to start our meal.  It's worth noting that the chips and salsa here are really delicious as well, but you really should try the guacamole if you are a guac fan.  

Margaritas are always good - house on the rocks is a favorite of ours (simple, not too sweet, lots of lime flavor), and the skinny margarita is pretty good as well, but beware - the tequila flavor is strong, so if you need a little sweetness, just go with the house margarita and eat four less chips.  Pineapple margarita and blood orange margarita are our favorite fruit-flavored options, really smooth and packed with fresh fruit flavor.

Pretty much everything on the menu we have had is amazing, and they are happy to customize it however you'd like.  Ceviche on this trip was still fresh, flavorful, and a generous portion for a meal if you add a side of rice or beans with it.  The chicken tacos were light and nicely spiced - with fresh tortillas and some salsa for the top, they are a great lighter option if you are gearing up for a night at the tables.

Overall Javier's never disappoints every time we go.  While it does not have the best views of the Strip, it's definitely worth a visit if you are fan of Mexican food, or just really love a great margarita.

My ex picked a condo near 36th and Camelback 6 years ago.  Then I lived in a funky, cool condo community near Campbell and 44th.  And now I reside within a minute walk of La Grande Orange Grocery (pronounce it LGO, much easier) and the original Postino Wine Cafe.

The hazelnut was very, very good.  It had a nice, rich flavour (but not the super strong, clearly fake, extract flavour), it wasn't grainy, and it wasn't too sweet (which is the case with many, many gelato places).  It was cool and creamy and smooth, and it was frozen slightly harder than many gelatos, which I prefer because I hate when they melt prematurely.

In hindsight, maybe the ""special"", lighter-coloured pistachio may be better?

I also tried the mint chocolate chip at the Kensington location and it was just okay.  It could've been mintier, there could've been more chocolate, and I didn't like that it was electric green.

Despite the so-so pistachio and mint, and the impatient service, I give Dolce 4 stars for having the best hazelnut gelato I've tasted in the city. I'd be interested in trying other flavours.  But next time I'll make sure I know what I'm ordering by the time I get to the front of the line! :P",2014-09-12 15:25:11

We like the place that much.  We went again today and ordered the mussels, which always make me blaspheme with pleasure they are so good.  They are on par with fresh mussels I've had on the coasts.  Just amazing.  And the broth is bacony and oniony and peppery.  They give you one slice of very good garlic bread per order, which is really not enough.  That order should come with two pieces so I don't have to pay a buck for another one or start dipping things like french fries and tacos in that wonderful broth.  One of these days I'm going to ask Kevin to hook me up with a dirty martini with about a 1/2 shot of that broth.

We typically get the fish and chips, which have always been perfect, but today for some reason I tried something different.  I had the pork tacos app for my meal and it came with four fat stuffed little soft shells with some tasty tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo.  Tender pork and flavorful salsa.  My belly was very happy.  I topped that with a Newcastle, and then was feeling frisky so I asked Kevin for one of those Three Olives Froot Loop drinks.  Great dessert.  Trust me.  The Baileys Bread and Butter Pudding is a stellar dessert choice as well.  

Mr. M had the cod sandwich and it was fried perfectly, as the fish always has been there.  It may seem simple to some, but there's really an art to cooking fish.  It doesn't take much to overcook it and whoever is frying it up back in Fibber's kitchen knows what they are doing.   I don't usually eat a lot of fries but theirs are like crack for me because they are skinny and brown and salty.  Mmmmmm mmm mmm.  And I will say a few of them got dipped in that mussels broth and that was delicious. 

So my only simple request, with eyes wide open like Puss In Boots in the Shrek movies, is to add a second piece of garlic bread to the mussels order.  Maybe do only one when it's half off during happy hour, but faith n' begorrah, one just isn't enough!!",2012-09-16 03:50:08

I've tried a couple places and this place has to be the best. 

Other foods: They have a variety of Vietnamese dishes, Chinese, and even Thai. But nothing taste super Authentic. So that's why I never order anything there except the Vietnamese sandwiches and their boba (which is decent). Not a fan of their Pho

Sodium-rrific, and totally gym-worthy, but I wouldn't go out of my way to drive here for food since it's not my type of comfort food and there have been better tasting Taiwanese places I've ate at in Toronto these past 25 years. If you dare to challenge the status quo of tastebud hype and current trends, try  Tai Ping Hsiang (花蓮太平香燒腊店) at Metrosquare for equally good if not better, popcorn chicken. Izakaya Ju in J-Town on Steeles has more authentic takoyaki too. 

Yeah yeah, I hear all of you shouting that this is a street food vendor so I'm giving unfair comparisons. But this is a street food vendor that has chosen to try and spar with small sit-downs and takeaway establishments. It's only fair to expect them to step-up their game. In the near future, I hope Pa Pa Chang saves up money and moves to a roomier space with air conditioning next summer. 

And I hope they deal with that random ghetto wash sink I sat near---strangers getting up and lining up to wash their hands behind me as I ate popcorn chicken and said ""Yummy"" is a very unique experience...what they really need to do now is add a bucket to go with that sink since this shop lacks a washroom.

As I was entering the restaurant, I stopped someone who was leaving with leftovers, that's a good sign. I asked how his experience was. He was less then enthusiastic about the food and service. That was not a good sign.

The sign says, ""seat yourself."" I looked for a good spot to sit and found a table near where other were seated. I found that it had food particles on it and a few napkins. One of the two only active waitresses came by and asked me to go sit on some waiting chairs. I waited while a waitress went to clean the table.

Once it was clean, she waved me over and I sat down. The seats are nice, no arms, and the temperature was quite cool on a hot Summer 100 degree plus day. Though I did smell cigarette smoke from the bar next door.

The waitress came by and asked to take my drink order. It was delivered in a fairly large cup, water usually comes by thimble size in restaurants these days, so that was nice.

Then it was time to order an entree. I opted for the Two Meat Combo for $18.99 which comes with two sides. I asked the waitress what were her most ordered sides. She said the sweet potato crumble and mac & cheese. So I ordered those along with a 1/4 chicken and ribs.

My previous experience with BBQ in Las Vegas stems from many visits to Ellis Island's BBQ and Famous Dave's. Both places serve large meals for good prices. So I was expecting more than what I received and after a pretty good wait.

For $18.99 I received two ribs and a quarter chicken plus the sides I mentioned above. The temperature of sides were adequate. The sweet potato crumble was initially delicious, after some time, it became too much for me to finish. The other person I went with ordered a potato salad, which was much better. The mac & cheese was tasty. The chicken and ribs should have been super hot. They were slightly warm to the touch, not what I was looking for. The person I went with also ordered the 1/4 chicken. It too was slightly warm, but not hot.

The person I went with got their 1/4 chicken and two sides for $10.99. How can they justify two ribs for an extra $8?

GRILLED BEEF TONGUE WITH SEA SALT & BLACK PEPPER (3/5)

GRILLED RICE BALL WITH BUTTER, SALMON & PORK (4/5)
Recommending this! This dish came sizzling hot. The outside crust was very crispy and the rice in the inside was nice and soft. The rice had a teriyaki flavour, which was delicious.

BAKED SEAFOOD WITH AVOCADO & CHEESE (1/5)
It sounds yummy right?! That's what I thought until I tried it. Omg don't order this. I'm a huge fan of avocados and I don't usually hate its taste but I don't know what went wrong with this combination.

OKONOMIYAKI (4/5)
I liked this! Lots of flavour - it  came sizzling hot. There's a mix of egg, pancake, Japanese okonomiyaki sauce and bonito flakes. It was a seafood filled okonomiyaki with shrimp, calamari and imitation crab.

JAPANESE STYLE CURRY PORK CHOP ON RICE (4/5)
The flavour of the curry pork cutlet was okay but I'm giving this a high score because I think it's worth the money. The portion is really big. You can share this amongst two people. Side dishes as part of the curry pork cutlet rice includes salad with sesame sauce, ketchup and fries.

JAPANESE STYLE SUKIYAKI HOT POT (3/5)
This hot pot came with sliced beef, meat ball, cuttlefish ball, fish tofu, imitation crab stick, kamaboko, rice cake, tofu, onion, sliced white turnip, nappa (veggie), enoki mushroom, cabbage, corn, mushrooms and udon.

I spent most of my weekends downtown and this was the perfect place to grab a drink and a reasonably priced food. However, their downfall was always slow and poor table service.

I hadn't been here for dinner since those first few years of opening, so I thought I'd try it out. I was disappointed to find that the service was exactly the same - SLOWWWWW. We came here on a Monday night, the place was dead, and it took way too long to get a drink and an entree. On top of that, the server was not attentive and never came back to our table with the empty martini glasses to ask if we wanted another. We were fully prepared to get another, but by the time he asked, we were already asking for the check.

While the service is unfortunate, the food is okay. For the price you are paying, it's a pretty good deal. And the only redeeming element of this place is their extensive drink and dessert menu. I'm pretty sure there were over 25 types of martinis and over 10 types of spiked hot chocolate. And the martinis were pretty scrumptious. I didn't get dessert on this occasion, but I've got it enough times from here to know that I have never been disappointed by their sweet treats.

The server was very nice and attentive. Not sure if it was because (after a little while) we were the only table in the place or if she would always be that attentive. Something about her personality leads me to believe it was not because there was only one table - but, that's just my general feeling.

Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas.  And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson, I haven't found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits. . . 

That is until Super Burrito opened recently.  Driving down Eastern a few months ago, I suddenly noticed the place were there.  So I stopped in.  And after the first visit, I've kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in. . .  

Super Burrito is a top notch taqueria.  They do a great job with the classic burritos-- carne asada and chicken.  Well-prepared meat with delicious beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla.  Each time I order one, I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell, not knowing what he was missing.

If that was all that Super Burrito did, I would give them a solid 3.5 stars, but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats.  I have fallen in love with their green chile pork.  Spicy and sweet and tender.  It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy.  I've also tried the coca-cola pork, which was crispy and interesting, but a little sweet for me.

Each time I go in now, I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me.  Whether they come up with new offerings or not, Henderson finally has a good taqueria.  And that's something to celebrate.  I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito's honor right after they have their first taste.",2011-01-11 22:45:32

I, like everyone else, discovered this hidden gem on Food Network. The next day I was there, and it has since become a favorite. 

If you're going on Saturday, wear comfortable shoes. I have waited as long as an hour and a half. During the week, you should be in and out pretty quickly. The portions are insane! I am an eater, and a three meat combo lasts me about 3-4 meals.

Meats:

Brisket: I don't like brisket. I order brisket from Kill Grill every time. It's tender, juicy.. simply divine. A must.

Tri Tip: Better than the brisket. The only con is that they only have it twice a week. If they have it, get it.

Pulled Chicken: Pass on this one. I don't know what it is, but it just isn't good.

Pulled Pork: It's good, but not my favorite. Don't get me wrong - compared to other places it's awesome, but they have better options in my opinion.

Sausage: A favorite. I usually get them cut up and drenched in sauce. They're a little bit spicy, but they're packed with flavor.

Ribs: Great flavor and extremely tender and juicy. You literally won't want sauce.

Sides:

I won't go into great detail, but I have tried the beans, macaroni salad and mac and cheese. They are all pretty tasty, but the mac and cheese is probably the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. It's a must!

Cobbler:

I've tried all three flavors - the cherry is really sweet. I prefer the apple.

For the amount of food you get, the prices are extremely reasonable. When they're really busy the service can sometimes be lacking, but they try.

The restaurant side was dead. There was one other table but they left soon after we sat. The server was friendly, but she was MIA a lot.  We ordered shrimp scampi for an appetizer, and I ordered a patty melt with sweet potato tots, and he ordered the salmon pan-seared and NOT herb-crusted. 

The food came out pretty quickly, but we had a to wait a lot of the time for water refills. The scampi was good, but very rich. The bread it came with was delish. My patty melt was just ok. I ordered medium, but it looked a bit rare to me. It also lacked any seasonings. The tots were yum. I didn't try my boyfriend's salmon, but he said it was just okay as well. Even though he ordered it pan-seared, it still came out herb-crusted, which he didn't like.

Over all, the food is okay, especially for what we paid.  Next time I'll stick to more basic bar food, like quesadilla or chicken tenders.

Went for dinner yesterday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  14 of us showed up and were accommodated around a giant round table - a refreshing alternative to the conversation-killing ""banquet rectangle,"" as our whole party could be a prt of the dinner chat.

As one friend put it, ""this is the best restaurant in Toronto with white plastic table cloths.  In fact, the tables are lined with layers of them - just peel one off for each new seating.  Rol San isn't much for decor, but it was the food and company that we were interested in and Rol San delivered on both fronts.  

On top of affording us a 14-person dinner conversation, the food was fantastic - we enjoyed some of their famous all-day dim sum (har gow and barbeque pork buns), and sampled for a host of dinner-time staple that included peppercorn beef tenderloin, sweet and sour pork and the classic chicken with mixed vegetables.

I got my first taste of Malaysian cooking many years ago on exchange in Singapore, and I'm so happy that there's a place here that satisfies my occasional craving for spicy South Asian food!  I love spicy but I really can't take it that hot.  The spice heat level at this place is just right - spicy enough for quite the kick to have me reaching for my glass of hot tea to cool down, but not so much that all I can feel on my tongue and lips is fire.  I'm a wuss with spice, so those who like it hot should just roll your eyes at my spicy description.

I had a Malay stir fried ho fun dish which came with thin slices of fish cake and Chinese preserved sausage with a bit of a kick.  We also ordered the beef brisket curry roti which is a must-try!  I love the curry here - the beef is so tender and there is just enough potato to enjoy the delicious curry.  This only comes with one piece of roti though.  It's pretty small and definitely not enough to really enjoy every last drop of the curry.

It has so much going for it, primarily one of the nicest, most relaxing patios on LVB. The food is just always ""fine"". Service always spotty. On the most recent episode of ""Maybe Herringbone""

SERVICE 
Uneven yet accommodating. They accommodated a special request to make a salad into a sandwich. Even through end result was questionable, the effort is appreciated. They also gave a free dessert for the off-peak lunch order taking almost an hour to come out. Hostesses and roaming managers always super engaging and friendly. 

FOOD
Tomato/Avo Salad: craving some texture, so asked to put on a wrap or sandwich if possible. What I got was half a salad on a butter toasted hamburger bun. I mean, OK, I asked for something done off menu but also said is fine if chef can't do it or thinks a bad idea. Paying $20 for an entree salad which amounted to a side salad on a bun was not particularly inspiring. Food was decent, just an awkward interaction all around.

1) It's visually stunning.  A very cool conversion of the old Maple Leaf Gardens space into a clean, modern, inviting supermarket.  
2) They have the best selection of food in Toronto.  If you can't find it here, you probably won't find it in Toronto (except for some Asian specialties)
3) It is expensive. I know groceries are always expensive in Canada, but this place takes the cake, a very pricey cake.

In case you're wondering, here some of the wonders you will find:
~~The wall of cheese: a large selection of expensive cheese (thank you Quebec)
~~Bakery: serving ACE bread, which is the best you'll do in a chain store.
~~Deli: big deli.  Tip: take a number, do some other shopping and come back.
~~Produce Wonderland: Pretty good selection here...it pays to comparison shop though...some of these prices can just be outlandish. $6/lb. for asparagus?!
~~Fresh Flowers: Cute, by the door
~~Prepared foods: pizza, sandwiches, real food, salad bar, soups...it's good.
~~Organic section: It's not Whole Foods, but it's got the basics covered.
~~Cupcake Wonderland: featuring lots of cupcakes and other desserts...I made up the name ;)
~~Tea shop, coffee shop: cheap coffee, expensive tea.
~~Pharmacy: slightly cheaper than Shoppers and reasonably fast.

The only other major negative than the prices are that it gets crowded as all get out sometime...especially Sunday evenings.  Prepare to wait in line.  And do me a favor, when people get in the 16 items or less line with 35 items, help me give them a dirty look.

Other features within the complex are:
~~Walk-in Clinic: It's awful, don't go...see my other review.
~~LCBO: I'm kind of surprised how small it is (also small selection) relative to the business it doees.
~~Joe Fresh: haven't given it a try.

A nice, light dish with a lovely flavor from the coconut and lime broth. They also brought a complimentary sorbet for my friend for her birthday, which was really sweet of them to do.
The second time I came here, we arrived shortly after it opened for dinner service. It was about a quarter full, so we got in right away. It started getting busier, but service remained attentive. We got the Warm Goat Cheese Dip and Baked Rosemary Yam Fries to start. The Goat Cheese Dip was to die for!!! So so good. The Yam Fries were also excellent, and I loved the Garlic Aioli that came with them. I got the Noodles of Contribution, which were so yummy. The jalapeno pesto had a nice kick to it, but wasn't overly spicy which I liked. The pumpkin seeds gave some crunch, and the portion was extremely generous.

I was very excited to go to Fern and hubby and I decided to go and treat a colleague. I ordered BBQ eggplant, which was basically raw and tough and barely cooked. The mac and cheese was weird in flavor and not in a good way -- it was sweet too which was not appealing.

My hubby ordered ramen and he said it had no flavor. The broth was so bland, he had to jack it up with hot sauce and salt to give it some flavor.

Service is always outstanding. Starting from the hostess all the way to our server . The ambiance is nice, however because its located in a very high traffic area of the casino , it can get loud. If you want something quiet try to seat on a table in the back.

Decoration wise, the place doesn't send the vibe of a steak house. With lots of trees and plants surrounding the whole area it feels more of a jungle themed café or even a sushi house. Food quality is great. Not the best steak Ive had here but very good. Their surf and turf is great .cooked just right and if you get a chance order the lobster mashed potatoes. Trust me on this.Also their appetizers are tasty as well. And if you love seafood , get the platter which will be expensive but well worth it.

I can say kokomos is above average, but not one of the Vegas top ones. For the price I usually expect a full on experience which is a combination of food, ambiance, location, etc.

I'll review Koishi and Moosehead later (if I haven't already)...

Krazy Fish is one of the places in CLT that we always take our out of town guests. We take our guests there for a number of reasons: 1) we like to show our friends and family Plaza Midwood and tell the story of the neighborhood's renaissance and how the residents helped to transform a neighborhood in decline into a truly vibrant community; 2) I love the atmosphere inside the restaurant ranging from the mannequin mermaid in the middle of the dining space to the sasquatch statue on the large round table near the bar; 3) the staff are fabulous -the waiters are all passionate about the food they serve, make great recommendations, and provide fabulous customer service; and 4) the food is absolutely out of this world! Who knew that Pan-Asian/South American/soul food could result in such an amazing fusion?!?! I have to admit I was skeptical the first time I read the menu, but oh my goodness- the fusion is pulled off what has to be divinely inspired fashion!

First off, I was pretty shocked by how expensive everything was.  The gourmet pizzas were outrageous.  So, we decided to just order a sausage pizza with the whole-grain crust. Despite the fact that it was 645 on a Friday evening, we were told they were out of the whole-grain crust. We were offered gluten-free and vegan alternatives. I explain to them that we were not gluten-free nor were we vegan so we did not want those crusts but that we would go ahead and just order the original.

We got the pizza to go. It took 15 minutes to get our order which was more than reasonable. However, it was not even worth the short wait. The crust had a weird taste and texture. Not sure if we somehow ended up with a gluten-free crust but it was very unpleasant.  It left an aftertaste that lingered and lingered.  The sauce and cheese tasted fine however, there was hardly any sausage on the pizza. Maybe 2 to 3 pieces per slice. Definitely not worth the $20 we paid. 

We also ordered the Italian chopped salad.  The half-size was plenty for two people to share along with the pizza. However, the tomatoes were soft and mealy, Again, just really unpleasant. Kind of ruined the salad for both of us.  We will not be back.

edited to add that both my daughter and I ended up feeling sick all night long.  Stomach cramps and more.  Without getting graphic, it was a pretty rough night.  Now I'm wondering if that strange taste the pizza had was because something was off?",2015-04-04 02:37:10

Our waitress waved to us through the glass, as we walked through the front door. Since we came shortly after they opened, the place was quiet (to start!), and it was a weekday as opposed to their craZy busy weekends that I've bore witness to, as I bike by and see a line-up out the front door.

It was our first time there and we had a lot of questions. Our waitress was patient with us, which was wonderful and something that may not be awarded during the weekend brunch hours, so the time we went was perfect!

I ordered the omelette on the Specials list for the day. It was a three-free-range-egg omelette that came stuffed with fried cauliflower and ricotta cheese and with guacamole and salsa verde on top, two toasted pieces of bread (cut in half) and a side salad with honey dijon dressing (this, I ordered instead of the French fries), which was a solidly good choice, since their french fried tend to be quite done, almost, if not, to the point of over done. I also got the smoked trout. AMAZING! Smoked fish is honestly one of my downfalls, so damn good!   

The ambiance and the way Fanny's is set up definitely gives off a homestyle feel. My sister said it is a mix of modern diner with vintage and I would agree with her. It's extremely clean and very inviting. Their signature colours are orange and a light brown and they've designed it in such a way reflecting that, with those colours blended throughout the space. It's very well designed!

There were other things that could have improved the experience:

My omelette for example, originally came with bacon inside and a beef brisket. I supplanted the beef brisket with the smoked trout, but the bacon, which I specifically told my server that I do not eat RED meat, it came with the first omelette I received. Thankfully, my sister was interested in trying some and I saw the bacon when I cut the omelette open. I'm not really a hard core vegetarian. In fact, I am more of a flexitarian, however RED meat is something I feel rather strongly about, in that I do not wish to have it near the food I am eating (preferably). I told my server. She was mortified and I understood that people are people and they make mistakes. Especially since I've been in the hospitality industry myself to know what it is like. It was also her first lunch shift. 

And while others, who are more particular with their food intake (ie. strict vegans and strict vegetarians) may have blown up and been super upset because it's BACON! I maintained my composure. Our waitress was incredible about it and allowed us to take that one home. In addition to the new omelette, sans bacon that was prepared for me, on the fly.

Restaurants tend to get loud, very loud when there are a number of people filling up the empty spaces and having their own conversations with one another. Some are a lot louder than they need to be, especially when talking to people RIGHT BESIDE THEM- it's their own prerogative. Unfortunately we experienced this with those sitting behind us. It was somewhat unpleasant and uncomfortable, considering I turned around and told them but it was also something beyond our control. People wanna be that way, there is not much anyone can do, except those specific people. People wanna be inconsiderate, rude and disrespectful... by all means! 

Apart from that my experience was over-all good. I'd like to try their finnish pancakes and perhaps other items, but I might get take-out next time.",2014-04-23 14:24:47

the advantage utopia has over other bubble tea places is that they have a large selection of board games, darts machines, and mah jong. although there are a few similar places near the center of toronto, this is the main one in the suburbs.

the quality of the food and drinks is not as great as other nearby sit down bubble tea places but again, they offer something the other places don't.

He and I have been to Lili a handful of times both separately and together, and it always seems like the staff have nothing but disdain for our presence.

One example: My first time for brunch we ordered at the counter, but because there were staff milling about tables, I did not think I needed to bus my table when we were done.  We got up to leave, and a very pissed-off-sounding staff person intercepted me to say, ""you need to bus your own table; we don't DO that here, asshat.""  Okay let me emphasize that she definitely did, in reality, not say the word ""asshat."" I'm taking creative liberties so you can properly appreciate the scorn dripping from every syllable. 

So there's the Scorn.  There is also the tasty food. They don't seem to much want our type of business, but we definitely want their type of food.  I have only had brunch, but my dining partner raves about how their sandwiches are some of the tastiest and healthiest in town with many vegan options. The brunches are delicious fixed-price plates-- usually a yummy vegetarian and a meat option each Sunday.

I really like Simon Sushi! This place serves miso soup to every customer who comes in to dine.  I used to work in the area, so I would get their lunch specials for $5.99. For lunch, I've tried the avocado/cucumber rolls with yam rolls; House noodle soup, crispy rolls, bento box, etc. All delicious.

I have also been here for dinner a couple of times, and it tends to be a lot less busy during this time.  The great thing about dinner is that the chef gives a complimentary piece of their suicide roll as well as edamame! 

The atmosphere is sort of run down a bit.  They really should renovate and fix up the walls and decor.  The service is decent; however, most of the waitresses don't speak English very well, so it's difficult to make any special requests if you have any.",2012-03-02 22:53:50

If you've never been to this cafe for their late night specials, you are seriously missing out. They offer super cheap steak and eggs (like $5 cheap), as well as biscuits and gravy and a bunch of other stuff.

Now that we have a baby, we aren't able to catch those awesome graveyard specials any longer, but they still offer great values at dinner time as well. 

Their daily special is either prime rib or a porterhouse steak for $14.95. The meal is served with a potato and veggie side, as well as choice of soup or salad. We're not talking gourmet here, but it's a great meal for the price.

I recently discovered the sausalito burger and love it! It's what I think a patty melt should be - it has buttery, toasted bread and is super delicious!

New Seoul is an unassuming restaurant towards West Towne Mall that really does Korean food the old-fashioned way. No fusion nonsense, no weird Americanized Korean options - their food is something a Korean grandma would recognize and make.

Both were solid, and it came with three side dishes and bottomless soup. Again, A+ for authenticity. The bibimbop had all the right parts, and the mandatory hot sauce was both spicy and flavorful.

Food:
You can load up on anything uni, toro, sashimi, oysters, anything. But just know that you will take a key hit in quality. This is a notch down from Sushi-Mon. The menu is also a lot more limited from Sushi Mon, so be prepared for that. While still good, just don't expect the best. 

Service:
The chefs here are really awesome and try to stuff your face full when you're done with your sushi. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar if you can. The wait staff was friendly at the beginning, but I think they got a little annoyed that we were ordering too much food, which we all ate by the way. It seemed like they ignored us for a while at one point in the night. 

Price: 
Dinner price is $30, which is $2 more than Sushi-Mon and doesn't include desert and 18% forced gratuity on a party of 4. They include sashimi, but can't give you desert added to the all you can eat menu? Its not like someone would come to this place and load up on mochi ice cream.

This is a true all you can eat restaurant minus desert. If you want to load up a limited selection of sushi, come here. If you want a bigger selection of sushi with better quality, go to Sushi-Mon.

They make a hole in the top bun for the toppings which was a good idea. Limited seats however. Someone told me it's too prevent having to provide a washroom but I didn't get to verify... I ordered the Duke and my wife got the calamari. The Duke was super salty. It was fairly hard to taste anything else in the sandwich. Tasted their gravy and that was super bland. Had some of the calamari and that was bland. It's like they took all the salt from the rest of their menu and put it in my sandwich. Only saving grace is the fries. They were pretty good fries.

WHAT: clothes & fashion galore!

For this review, I am going to talk about the upsides and the downsides to this Forever21 location!

Positives- This location is huge, and it once used to be the Macy's department store! There are millions of product to choose from, so you are bound to walk out with at least one thing each and every time you decide to go inside.

Negatives- Like I have previously stated, this location is huge! & if you already have something in mind, it might take a while for you to find that one thing you came in looking for, haha. And! Their return policy is the worse! If you have not yet tried to return something, and do not know their policy. You have 30 days to return or exchange your item WITH YOUR RECEIPT, and for STORE CREDIT. You do not get cash back, so buy something that you really LOVE! =)

Another downside is their customer service is extremely poor! It is probably one of the top retail stores who try to give good customer service, but fail to do so... I was in there a couple of days ago, and there were these pants on a mannequin that I wanted to purchase.  I asked one of the workers, and she had told me it was the last pair. Then she followed with another sentence (rudely) saying they can't take it off the mannequin.  So, in my head I am thinking why leave it on the mannequin? Other retail stores would be happy to take the clothing off the mannequin and finally sell it!

In other words, have fun & hopefully you don't get into a situation like I did! Haha =)",2012-03-04 19:08:14

I had the New York Steak ($34) with grilled asparagus ($8) with raspberry ice tea ($3) while my son had the Shrimp Scampi ($25) with loaded mashed potatoes ($9) with raspberry ice tea ($3).  We were seated immediately in the main dining room.  Our waitress was Lynn and she was very pleasant plus attentive.  

The food came out about 25-30 minutes after our order was taken.  When it to our table, everything on the plates were at the right temperature and seasoned well.  

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.  It is a great place to have a business or family meals.  Yes, it is pricey, but the portions are very large.  I think next time an appetizer with a side would probably do the trick.",2017-12-31 00:34:43

I (of course ) had checked the yelp reviews and my mouth was watering before we even made it to the car. I couldn't decide between the sweet basil, the pad Thai, the spicy green beans or the green curry. Green curry won. 

I can't say how phenomenal it was. I got four out of five stars and the heat was great. The dish didn't sacrifice flavor for heat either. Possibly the best green curry I've ever had. 

My friend got the crispy chicken in cream sauce which he said he dreams about. I'd never had anything like it. It was very good.

RptaekN1lRLDHlhTGs911Q,YPyrFh8AImi-sgLDbt1-8A,ziJsGjXvidzZWC1I0-SOSg,3,1,2,1,"My husband took me here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night with reservations for 8:15.  It's intimate, dimly lit, and we were seated near the window at a table for two.  One of us had to choose to not have the window view, and therefore was able to watch the kitchen staff. Attire is ""smart business"" which is apparently a step above business casual, though I saw patrons wearing jeans and sports jerseys.  Our server was polite, helpful with recommendations, and expeditious after we had received our entress.  I'll break down our meals: 

Starters: 

1) Tandoor Naan.  This simple bread was delicious, and the cheapest (and probably most filling) on the menu.  It comes with garlicky hummus, cucumber sauce (think: tzatziki), and a very gingery berry sauce.  Probably too much ginger for my taste.  Also, don't do the hummus if you plan on being, erm, intimate with anyone.  Within the next week or so.  Just being cautious.  
2) Burrata. It had a great smoke taste in the tiny creamy portion and was accompanied by crisped pancetta which was more akin to burnt bacon, to be honest.  The honeydew and tarragon jelly were scant and really didn't impact the dish other than to provide some color on the rim of the dish. 

Entrees:  I enjoyed a nice glass of flowery moscato.  Best part of my meal. 

1) Black cod.  Fish was great, well cooked with a crisp skin.  Lobster ravioli was one large ravioli with small chunk lobster meat. Not worth $34.  
2) Jumbo Scallop.  The scallops were very gritty. I kept biting into it and experiencing the painful crunching of a scallop that was probably not soaked long enough.  And it was all of them.  They had a beautiful sear on one side only.  The succotash was terribly over-salted.  I like salt, but I couldn't eat it because it was just too much. The greens were relatively on-existent in the succotash. The cauliflower puree was missed, as it was just an empty promise on the menu to build up the description.  The two 1/8th-1/4th cup portions of the risotto was also disappointing in that I relied on them to fill me up in the absence of edible succotash. 

Dessert: Served with over-brewed, strong coffee, though we were given an urn to split between us, about 2 cups each.  Served with homemade sugar cubes, sugar packets, and cream.  Oh, coffee was additional. 

1) Sticky toffee pudding.  Delicious.  Small portion, delicious ice cream.  Sticky. 
2) Confused pineapple cake.  The pineapple was not sufficient to help me down the overly dry, crumbly, and dense butter cake. Neither was the artsy presentation. I don't remember the vanilla cream.  The tart cherry puree was used by myself in a desperate attempt to help me eat the stale yellow cake.  Waste of a good $9.  

All-in-all, it was an OK dining experience in a great atmosphere.  I agree with others who feel it's over-priced based on quality.  I'm sure it's costly due to locale of the restaurant.  We easily spent over $150 between two of us based on the meals above.  But, if you like expensive food served in beautifully displayed elf proportions, then this place may be right for you.  I think we may try it again, but only after we experience some of the other dining Pittsburgh has to offer.",2016-03-08 02:55:51

The first time was highly disappointing - I remember feeling robbed, and wishing we had gone to Roka Akor instead. Also, I did not appreciate one of the servers ""teaching"" us about why we shouldn't ask for soy sauce for sashimi we had ordered. Maybe the chef had advised the waitstaff to share that it had already been lightly brushed or whatever, but the message was lost in her air of pretension/didactic delivery. The networking event was...like any other networking event. My most recent visit, however, was amazing. We sat at the bar, and thoroughly enjoyed everything, especially the Kusshi oysters. I had qualms about eating oysters during a non ""R"" month, but they were plenty fresh. We spent a little more than we had anticipated despite the HH menu being priced very modestly (close to $100 for 2, I think?), but we'll definitely be going back for the HH. It will probably take a while before we go back for a full dining experience again, though. Oh, and the bartender was awesome.

Total scammers! 

I called them because the house I bought had a water heater installed from them previously and the valve on top was leaking along with having barely warm water coming out. I figured I would call them to see if the unit was under warranty. 
HUGE $455 mistake!!!!!!!! 
After calling to ask how long the warranty was, the next thing I know, I'm scheduled for a service call so they can tell me if its covered. 
OK, I fell for that sucker move.
Guy shows up in minutes (WTF? Was he waiting around the corner or something?) and after some lame questions, of which he was all wrong about, he diagnoses it as the circuit breaker. WRONG! I already checked it myself. 
Then some more lame questions and troubleshooting to find that the upper element is shot. Now, keep in mind, I'm still thinking its under warranty. Since this is a repair I have done myself a long time ago, and could easily re-do again, I let him continue with his diagnosis.
He comes back, after taking a personal phone call (RUDE), and tells me its $455 to rebuild  the unit (not under warranty) plus $70 for the valve but he'll only charge me the $455 (with some extra BS thrown in about being given ""the returning customer"" price and crap). Like a moron, I ""bite"" thinking the valve plus the kit would cost me about $120 from Home Depot and having to buy the tools to do it, another $100 or so.
Since having just moved in, I was unsure where all the tools were that I would need to do the job, I decided to green light the serious RAPING of my checkbook.
Later that day, I find myself at HD and out of curiosity, I look up the parts I had replaced that day from these clowns. $37 DOLLARS! Are you f'n kidding me???!!!!!!

Best part, I bought into all the additional crap spewed from the installer's mouth about how ""the stuff from HD was all wrong"" and ""it didn't have any install warranty"", blah, blah, BS, blah.

You can order anything from skewers, nigiri and an assortment of other food when you get the AYCE. I tried the bacon/scallop skewers which were ok.

This is what happened to Borders, my favorite book store. (I had to thin out my collection of books anyway since moving to a smaller space). Looks like there are three of these locations remaining in town.   

We just happened to come on a Book Fair day (there were a couple students in the front of the store, asking for customers to scan their code so that their school would get credit) so it was filled with people, this past saturday afternoon. Otherwise, unless a bookstore was going out of business, I had never seen it so filled up! Inside, there is a Starbucks (to the left, middle, when you walk inside). Magazines were to the immediate left side as you walk inside. I was searching for a newly released book in Fiction. I noticed that there are no marked down books, or maybe I didn't look far enough. I was mostly in the middle of the store. I didn't notice any empty chairs either, but then again, I was primarily focused on Fiction.

There was a ton of Harry Potter merchandise in the front of the store. There were books on quiddich, the sorting hats (my son put it on and told me, ""Take a picture"", the nasty jelly beans (like ""dirt"", gross), wands, etc.

I grew up on Southern California's ""Cali-Mex"" which is LOTS of AVOCADOS, lots of carne asada, light on the beans, and sometimes fries in the burrito.

Type Of Merchandise:

The majority of the shops were women's clothing, the sorts of things you'd find at Winners. Lots of children's shops. One entire aisle devoted to food, mostly jams and sauces and nuts, sort of like what you'd expect to see at outdoor fairs.

Originality of Shops & Merchandise:

Most of the shops had merchandise that was popular 5 or 10 years ago. There was very little innovative or new merchandise. There were some vendors that sold merchandise that was obviously not original or even made in Canada or not even remotely hand made. 

Price of Merchandise:

Fair to overpriced. Most vendors were between 5-10 dollars too expensive.

Type of Shoppers:

Mostly female, lots of strollers and mostly out-of-towners, and lots of the blue rinse crowd. 

Booth Rentals:

A vendor told me she paid $3500. for her small booth rental space only. It didn't include her display stands and lighting which she estimated cost her another $1000. 

Overall I think the show organizers are the ones making the money here. I got a free ticket to get in and would never pay the $14.00 they are asking. Overall I think the show is a bust.",2011-12-07 12:44:55

I cannot say what his experience was like, but  my husband and I have been the ones getting his vehicle serviced.   And we've also got our vehicle serviced here once, which is an old Ford Explorer.

We've had several service advisors - James Rubio, Robert Pence a couple times and Ashley.  When I asked James Rubio during one of the oil changes on my dad's car to take a look at something, he didn't do it.  He didn't even write it on the ticket.  His demeanor was okay - like a take it or leave it kinda attitude.

Robert Pence, both times we had him, someone else had to help us because he was either busy or helping someone else.  I believe one of the times James Rubio had to help us and it was the same thing - just so so customer service, not rude, but it seemed like he'd rather be somewhere else.  The 2nd time, which is when we got a recall notice for something in our Explorer and took it into the nearest Ford dealership, which is San Tan, we were scheduled with Robert.

Robert wasn't anywhere to be found when we came in, so Eric P helped us.  He was a very pleasant and nice guy.  He asked me if I wanted the car washed and I said yes.  He probably told Robert, but this wasn't written down.  I expressed to Eric I needed to pick up my car by a certain time and Robert gave us a call at 4 pm and said the car was ready.

Our Explorer was not washed.  When we arrived, Robert was on the phone talking with a customer.  He wouldn't even look up or look at me to acknowledge me.  I stood there at least 5 minutes and never once when I was looking did he look at me.  Eric, who was a couple desks down, saw that I had been waiting and it didn't look like Robert was going to get off the phone anytime soon, decided to help me instead.

So basically, my appointment was with Robert to take care of me, but Eric did all the work.  Not right.  If Eric has a lower position than Robert, they should switch because Eric gives good customer service and Robert stinks.  I give Eric a 5 and Robert a 1.  At least he could have looked at me and told me he would be with me shortly.  I was standing like 3 feet from him.

The 3rd time I came in for an oil change for my dad's car, Ashley helped us.  She did a walk around of the vehicle and found the bottom front passenger's side bumper/fender area loose.  She said she'd have the guys take a look at it.  When we got the car back, they had clipped the loose part off, did the oil change and washed the car.  Ashley called me when the car was ready.  Pretty much dealing with Ashley was totally great.  This is how a service adviser should be, not only a pleasant person to deal with but also does what she says she will do.  I give Ashley a 5 star, a 6 if I could.

With James Rubio, I also had to make a couple of calls to see when my car would be ready and when I came in and said it was done, they had not done the car wash, so I had to wait for that and I was in a hurry.  I give him a 2 star.

So, there should be more advisers like Ashley and Eric, but not Robert and James.",2014-08-27 13:39:42

The menu is not cheap. Since I only go when I'm in the mood to splurge, I've only ever ordered the omakasi (tasting menu). Actually, in the market of tasting menus, a set that is still under $100 is arguably a bargain. 

Mr. Shu uses fresh and high quality ingredients, and he prepares the dishes with a light sophisticated touch. Of the multiple courses, my favorites are the tuna tartar and the kobe steak.

My first encounter with Sugar Cafe was actually through their presence at the Yelp Event in Fall 2011 held at the Toonseum. They provided a smattering of macarons and cupcakes, all of which were delectable!

My second was a trip here with a Living Social coupon (methinks I have a shopping trend here). I came for brunch and ordered the grilled cheese on sourdough, complete with tomato, and an almond cupcake. Now, I'm a self-proclaimed grilled cheese connoisseur, and this one seriously took the cake (or sandwich)! I ordered mine with cheese options combined, so there was no shortage of fromage dripping from all sides. The sourdough really gave it nice flavor, since sandwich bread can be oh-so-bland.

As for the cupcake, I didn't expect it to be as tasty as it was. It almost seemed like they poured an entire bottle of almond extract in the frosting and batter, 'cause they definitely did NOT skimp on flavor! Too many bakery items claim almond as a name, but so few actually taste like it. While the texture of the cake itself was a bit dense for my taste, the flavor was just soooo divine.

They are known for  their ""seafood"" buffet on the weekends and I'm not sure if it's at night as well.  On seafood weekends they have fresh raw oysters, shrimp cocktail, crab legs ( I'm not sure if its king or snow ), cooked clams, and some other seafood dishes.  Then they have different cuisines like Greek, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Spanish and even Hawaiian.  It's a pretty long snake like buffet line with craving areas too, on the weekends and for dinner they have prime rib - yum!
There's also free wine, beer, lattes and espresso (please remember to tip!) and they have a gelato and sorbetto station which is awesome!  For the ice cream or cappuccinos, please remember to stand on the dessert line, it's rude to cut.  

My favorites from this place are their baked ziti, clam dish, prime rib with sweet potatoes and mashed potatoes and string beans, spicy tuna rolls, oxtail dish, shrimp cocktails, the warm snow crabs (they also have the chilled ones and I feel like they are super salty), cream brulee, flan, chocolate chip cookies (they bake it fresh!) and the gelato.  It's nice to be able to get a fresh cup of cappuccino to go with my dessert too, so that's a huge plus!

If you sign up for their players card and gamble a little, they send you flyers for buy one get one free for the buffet which we always take advantage of. 
This in my mind has topped Bellgio's buffet.",2011-08-26 20:00:29

It went really well with my stone pot rice and the korean pancake was also good. Almost a filipino version of Okoy. Service was prompt and the place was well maintained.

I'm giving them 3 stars because they met the minimum of what they had to do.

Because we have another Ford that is also fairly new bought at a different dealership, though I'm not happy with that dealership's sales department, most of the service department at the other Ford dealership nearby is alright, so as long as we don't get a couple of the guys.

I got Mike Bradley.  He was okay, but I have a number of better service people I've dealt with over the past couple years, so he was minimally polite to me.  He wasn't discourteous, but he was just doing what he's supposed to be doing.  I had an appointment set for 1:30 pm today, which I was on time for, maybe a couple minutes early.  When I set the appointment more than a week before, I told them I had other things going on and they said it would take at the most 1 1/2 hrs.

When I got there and asked Mike when my car would be ready, he said at least 2 hrs.  AT LEAST.  I told him that I was told it would take 1 1/2 hrs when I booked my appointment, which is what my schedule allowed.  They took the full 2 hrs, so then I was late to my 3:30 pm appointment by a 1/2 hr, not good.  

I told Mike about my dissatisfaction that if their booking people say 1 1/2 hrs, they should meet that or do better, not worse.  Everyone is busy and I went by what they said.  He was a little sarcastic with me at the beginning when I asked for my car to be washed.  Since I didn't know him, it was not appropriate to be sarcastic to me.  

When I got into my car, the outside looked alright, but the inside of my car was dirtier than when I gave them my car.  Someone with very dirty shoes got the inside of my car, driver's side, dirty.  A part of the interior of my car is cream colored.  Not cool.

The excuse I was given for it taking 2 hrs was because it had an oil change, tire rotation, and car wash.  That's the usual service that I get at SanTan Ford and they do it in less than 1 1/2 hrs usually for our other Ford.

I'll probably try a different AutoNation for our next service because I don't have a lot of confidence that if they dinged my car or something that they would say.  And, while I was there, there seemed to be a couple other people that were not happy with whatever was going on.

They have a really nice waiting area, but I really would prefer excellent service and work, and it was just okay.",2015-08-11 01:16:00

Serrano's isn't the best Mexican food ever, but its WAY better than SS.  I've been to Serrano's several times and I would go back.  SS, I wouldn't go back if you paid me, sorry.

Serrano's has real beans, pretty good chips and salsa and the bean dip is really good (my wife loves it).  I've never had anything bad there, only once was I a little dissapointed when they didn't have oregano to put in the menudo (hello?  its like not having any ketchup for your fries!).

All of the staff are very nice and willing to help. The theater can be hot at times, but the staff is usually very aware and will turn on extra ac if it gets too warm for the majority. Also the staff does a fantastic job at intermission with the ladies bathroom. They usually have 2-3 attendants pointing where to go and which stall is unoccupied. It makes the line go very quick, which I am appreciative. I like that they have drinks and snacks available to buy. $7 for a single pour mixed drink $10 for a double.  You can have your drinks in the theater but no food. 

With all of this being said, and of the around 10 shows I have been to I  have never had a problem... until Rock of Ages last Friday. There was an obnoxious group of drunk people who would not stop talking and singing louder than the actors. At one point yelling a profanity so loud (from the Mezzanine section) the actor looked up at her. After about 10 minutes I pulled aside the door person looking over the section to make sure people didn't have phones or food and asked her to say something. These people were on the end of the row literally right in front of her so I thought she would say something before I asked her. She told me she would go to her supervisor to ask him to say something. Totally cool, you only have so much authority. So we waited... and waited and listened to these people ruin the show. Nobody said a word. Not. One. I watched other employees come in and stare at them. I watched other people around get upset their experience was being ruined. And I watched the drunk group go in and out and get more and more drinks, apparently nobody stopped serving them. 

This was totally unacceptable. The staff did nothing and said nothing. Continued to serve these people, and watched idly as they dumped at least 4 drinks all over the floor.

She is always on point with refills and checking back with you even when it's busy.

As for the food, it has great taste and value. I tried the pancakes my gal-pal got and they were awesome. So awesome I had to come back a few days later just to order them specifically. They are really filling even if you get a short stack. The batter is crazy, I get this taste of vanilla or something that's added to it that really makes it taste awesome. Always gotta get the home fries with ketchup. 

Besides that, I've really only gotten that one where you get eggs, home fries, a meat, toast and juice for like 8$ or something. Tastes great and came out quick. Definitely would like to have an omelette next time.

The lamb ribs are frickin' delicious and my juicy burger was, too. Some kinks to work out as a new business, but I'll be back to try more menu items soon, no doubt about it.

FOOD: Menu is burgers and ribs. Duh. The aforementioned lamb ribs are what they recommend most, and with damn good reason. They're flavorful, they're juicy, they taste great. The Old Skool burger (American, mustard, pickles, onion, BBQ, and aioli) is classic, juicy perfection. Meats are really good quality, cooked just right. 

BEVERAGES: Wine, beer, ""craft bottled sodas"" and Fiji water available only. We were told tap water wasn't available yet the table next to us was offered some after they finished their beers. Other tables had a (probably lower-priced) generic water bottle yet we weren't offered other options than the small, room-temperature Fiji. Not really a fan of the inconsistency, just let me have iced water. Snag a can of Fosters to keep the Aussie spirit flowing.

SERVICE: Mostly friendly staff, management welcoming folks at the door, that's what I like to see! Line at door was backed up, moved slowly. Guy at register was easily distracted and took several minutes to take our simple order. Food took 40+ minutes to come out, I won't count this against them unless it's still that backed up when I return in a month. Expediting and streamlining the kitchen takes time with a new business, I get that.

PRICING: For the few other reviews whining about pricing, ribs are not budget food in the first place. The $18 rack of lamb was priced just right, IMO. Burger was under $10 but some went up to about $14. Still not outlandish, our dinner was right over $30. Considering the other options in this area AND the quality, they're not overpriced.

Butter chicken is not something that is part of traditional Indian cuisine, so for me, it's something special. This place is also special because it's not just Indian cuisine, but also Nepalese cuisine. While we didn't try anything that's traditionally Nepalese that evening, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and service, as well as the food. I will be back to try more things. Something that's interesting is that they served food on thalis (those metal tray-like dishes each item is separated in it's own place). I do not enjoy eating off thalis so much, but it's a different experience if you've never tried it before. The prices are fair, and the portions are large. Worth the visit!",2016-03-18 17:00:03

The price is pretty average for this type of restaurant but it's not really on the ""cheap"" side. The appetizers are always plentiful and delicious- they never skimp out on the kimchi. 

I've tried a wide variety of items of their menu and I have never been disappointed. Bibimbap, sushi dinner, sushi boat, kalbi, kimchi stew, udon soup, chicken teriyaki bento box.. They are all great. The sizes could be a bit bigger but if you're ordering the dinner sushi boxes, those will fill you up! 

The waiters sometimes need to be reminded of things to bring you (water, forks or extra tea) but they are good at checking in sometimes. Depends on which waiter you get.

A friend and I shared the Bleu Burger (shallot-port syrup and bacon mayo) and the 3AM (sunny side egg, peppered bacon, carmelized onion, hollandaise), and added on the truffle fries and potato skins with the check-in offer. The Bleu burger was awesome in that they totally deliver on the cheese, but I couldn't really taste the bacon-mayo. The 3AM burger wasn't really my thing, and neither of us finished our portion. Both burgers were overcooked to well-done but we felt it wasn't worth the hassle to ask them to remake them, but it did make a negative impact. I will say that the truffle fries were amazing, and I really liked the house-made ketchups. The potato skins were received after the rest of our order, but weren't bad.

Service was polite. The layout is a little odd with a walk-up counter but table service, and very little in the way of decor.

Yes, admittedly, the bar made of ice (normal bar but with a patch of ice running down the middle to set your drink on or play with if you are a strange person) was the deciding factor on entering this bar.  Just walking in and seeing the amazing architecture, chandeliers, and unique 3-story painting on the wall was worth the time.

I don't drink martinis and hardly drink while we are at it.....but these cocktails that the highly socially gifted bartender, Kerry, made for us were out of control.

Sunrise Coffee is located approximately 6~7 miles away from the Strip and the overall atmosphere is pretty hip with some trendy & smoothing background music (personally this is a great place to study). To my amazement, Sunrise Coffee actually has a drive thru! That gotta be the 1st non-franchised & family owned coffee shop drive thru I've visited.

Outlets are limited here (so pick your table wisely) & there's free self serving iced water. You will find many vegan & gluten free breakfast options. Once your are done with your drink & food, you can return both cups and plates at the pick up counter (you'll see a tray).

Alien Burrito (tomato basil tortilla with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell peppers and ranch dressing, $6.75): Not sure whether I actually like tomato tortilla (pretty rough texture). Pretty good for veggie burrito - I could taste both sour cream and avocado. The portion was fairly big too.

Nutella Latte (hot, small 12 oz $3.70): Oh wow ... sometimes it only takes that one sip to determine how great the coffee is and this latte belongs to THAT category. Oh such a glorious drink - aroma, sweet, and creaminess were in perfect balance. Normally you would think Nutella is really sweet - well not with this cup of latte!

Cowfish is the perfect place for us since I can get my sushi fix while he can eat regular american cuisine.  Whoever came up with this concept is a genius!  

The menu at Cowfish is very extensive including lots of tempting apps, a huge array of typical (and atypical) sushi, burgers, ""normal"" american entrees (grilled chicken, steak, etc), and plenty of milkshakes and other non-ice cream desserts.

We started with a FREE appetizer by becoming a ""cowfish junkie"" online before dinner.  All you have to do is enter your email address on their website and they'll send you coupons.  We had the blackened ahi tuna nachos.  I thought they were incredible with lots of complementing flavors coming together in a perfect combination.

I ordered a double salmon roll and the foreplay roll for dinner.  The sushi description says an 8 piece roll is big enough for an entree and I was a little skeptical.  Turns out, an 8 piece roll was more than enough to fill me up and I had to take 8 pieces home with me.  Each piece of the roll is huge and hard to fit in your mouth in one bite.  I would highly recommend asking for it to be cut into 10 pieces to avoid any awkwardness.  Both rolls were stuffed with fresh salmon and other ingredients and were delicious!  The sushi was definitely comparable to what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant.

The decor was modern cool with all red walls, black ceiling, and bright, colorful pop art on the walls.  This place could double as a decent date spot or a cool place to hang with some friends.  If you're cold-natured like me try not to sit next to the large garage-style retractable doors in the winter.  It gets a little breezy.

Our waiter was excellent and he gave good recommendations for each section of the menu.  That was quite helpful and practically everything we ordered came from his recommendations.  At the end of our meal the manager came over to introduce himself and he gave us 2 more FREE appetizer coupons!

We were seated sort of in a hallway, but it was nice because it wasn't in the fishbowl window looking out into the mall, and it was something of a private booth for two. Before dinner I went to wash my hands and the washrooms are immaculate. Great sinks and taps and a fireplace. Nicer than most of the places I lived in Edmonton. 

We ordered a veggie burger and their teriyaki rice bowl, and the food was great. The veggie patty itself was no big deal, but the pesto and vegetables on it were delicious. The rice bowl was great too, although a little sweet. 

Service was quick, with lots of staff buzzing about. I'm not sure they have their table numbering system memorized because we were brought our neighbour's food and someone else was brought ours, which was comical. (Not a huge deduction for that.)

I thought it was like loco moco to put egg over rice.  Turning the menu all the way back, they have many drink selection.  I couldn't resist but order boba drink.

I was very pleased with my shrimp and pork dish, nice flavor, and was glad I added the egg.  Boba drink was just okay. Unfortunately tapioca was still partially frozen and I think most of the tapioca was larger than think straw they gave me. I had to take the lid off to eat the remaining of tapioca.  Lychee tasted like regular lychee. They were frozen but I still liked them.

Great carving station but they had lamb- No beef!? Turkey, ham and chicken. 

There's and omelette station as well as eggs Benedict and corn beef hash as well as spam! 

Gemma is a great server. Very prompt and always checking in.

Definitely not a bad place to relax and enjoy a reasonably priced and good tasting meal. 

If you're in the area, I suggest this place as it looks newer than most of the area and it doesn't seem too busy. 

Thanks for feeding me and providing a wide selection of food to satisfy my pallet.

Oh yeah... They also have a champagne brunch... Get your buzz on!

Ariel was very helpful when I called to make the reservation. When we got there, they wouldn't seat us until more than half of our party had arrived. Once we finally sat the service was just really bad. It took forever for anyone to come and greet us and take our drink orders. When they did I ordered a pitcher of sangria that was on the drink menu and the waiter told me that they don't do pitchers. I told him it was on the menu but if they stopped making pitchers then we would just have 2 glasses. He said he'd have to check on that. He had only taken half of the table's drink orders and rather than take the rest he left to figure out about the sangria situation. He finally came back and said they don't make sangria anymore, ok fine. So we ordered the Berry Fresh specialty cocktails and those were actually quite good. They put out popcorn which is a nice touch and tasted very good but it was only 2 small bowls for our group of 12 and they never refilled or asked if we wanted more. Most of us ended up ordering burgers, mine was a turkey burger and it was ok, nothing special although the fries were good. No one ever checked to make sure we were happy with our food. After eating we just payed our bill right away and left. We actually went and had a drink at the bar right outside of Holstein's before heading to Marquee, maybe we would have stayed for another drink there but we all just wanted to leave. Honestly the food was decent and I would maybe consider giving them another try to check out the spiked milkshakes which looked very good, but the service really made our impression of Holstein's pretty negative so I'm not sure if I'll be back. I would rather go to Bachi Burger.",2015-10-24 20:50:35

Compare this to an incident at Harry's in La Jolla years ago.  There was a foreign object in my omelet.   The waitress apologized profusely, brought me a complete new breakfast, and my meal was on the house.

I think it would have been a nice touch for our waitress to at least apologize.  She may have surmised that my own lips had lipstick residue from kissing Lucinda.  Not so.  The ""Coffee Cup"" was soiled.  Our visit was a weekday morning.  No crowd.  Our food came practically in an instant.

I'm not a fan of blaring music.  Awful Jimmy Buffett tunes blasted forth.   An adjoining annex had a TV blaring, so we sat in the main area.

I don't get the raves about the décor.  It's just a jumble of water skis, old license plates, and photos of miscellaneous vacationers at the lake.  It's not an attractive mess like Blackie's by the Sea.

Tried the Banana eclair on the second visit along with duo of short bread and a mousse dessert.
Mousse was good. Banana eclair has real banana chunks in it. Good but overpriced in IMO.

I mean - c'mon service is great but let me finish my roll without making me confirm that all if good. 

Also, their prices are a bit high and it does not look like they have any kind of ""Happy Hour"" with discounts for things. However, to be honest, food quality was real good! No complaints about that at all.

The meal that I had last time was definitely much better than their breakfast. I came in here Christmas Eve morning and there wasn't much of a wait, which I appreciated.

That's not the fault of the restaurant, it's just a poor design. 

i got a Denver omelette which is pretty hard to mess up. It wasn't the worst that I've ever had but the omelette wasn't very hot and there was way too much cheese on it. Also, the hash browns had a weird taste that I can't explain. The toast and coffee was good. And so was the service for that matter.

on for a number of years. Great concept - Chinese/Mexican
(Con)fusion without any pretense. At the original location
by the horsey races they give Chino Bandido virgins the
whole flavor sample deal - you almost get a full meal just
trying all the different possible fillings. So in this
Chandler location I didn't notice that whole ritual. It
is more of just figure out what you want and fill out the order
sheet. 
   The order sheet seems to trip up a lot of folks.
It ain't rocket science or quantum finance, folks. Don't
even look at the sheet. Figure out what you want to eat
first and then look at the sheet (see photo) and figure out 
how to express that. 
  It's easy. You get 14 items to choose from: Carnitas, Chile
Relleno, Chinese BBQ Pork, Egg Foo Yung, Gringo Chicken, Hengrenade
Chicken, Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken, Emerald
Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Veggie Salad, Pollo Diablo, and Machaca.
Got all that? Now you can choose to get this as a rice bowl, 
combination, Quesadilla, or Burrito. 
   For the rice bowl, you just choose one item with steamed rice or
optional beans as well. You can also add fried rice for 75 cents.
   For the combo, you can choose two different items (it says 1-20 
but I think they meant 14) and circle either BLK for Black or REF for 
refried beans. Then you also choose what type of fried rice you want. 
JFR for Jerk Fried Rice, CFR for Chicken Fried Rice, PKFR for pork 
fried rice, and PLFR for plain fried rice. This is pretty much the 
full-on big plate. You can also get the items in either a burrito or 
a quesadilla by specifying a Q or B. This way you get a burrito or
quesadilla in addition to your fried rice and beans. 
   You can also get items as Quesadillas. You can mix more than one
item together if you're daring. Same with the burritos. 
   You can also order the rice and beans as a separate side if you 
didn't get the rice bowl or combo and wanted it anyway. You can get
it as a pint or quart as well if you want to take some home.
   Finally, the cookies. You get a free cookie anyway but if one ain't
enough they have a space for you to order half a dozen or a dozen.
   Drinks - pretty much self explanatory. I like this place. I don't need
an endorsement by Guy Fieri to justify my liking this place. This is 
an occasional lunch outing with co-workers when the mood strikes. Lately
I've just been getting Quesadillas and Burritos and skipping the whole
rice and beans thing. I don't need to fall asleep in any meetings thank
you. :) One thing about this location - even though you don't need 
higher education to fill out the order form you might still need a 
sextant, compass, telescope, and charts to find the place. The Google
map makes it look like it is right on Chandler but it's deep southeast 
into the mall. Lots of parking but not necessarily right next to the
place during the lunch rush.",2012-06-03 08:37:57

I went last night with two of my girlfriends after dancing away at the Rock in Rio festival. One of my friends who is a born and raised Las Vegan said The Peppermill is a Vegas staple and we HAD to go because my other friend and I have never been. By the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. The restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. We were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.

The ambiance is something else!! Probably the only positive about this place. Neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. I felt like I was in a different decade.

Our female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. I don't think she smiled once. We ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. We got a round of blue moons and ordered crab cakes, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings.

A different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. We closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. It didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down. 

- Crab Cakes; Average, nothing special. I think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce 
- Buffalo Chicken Wings; Lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! Came with carrots and celery per usual
- Nachos; HUGE portion. Had cheese, jalapeños, black olives on top. The cheese was cold and dry. They gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. Not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. Also came with guac, pico, and sour cream. 
-  Mozzarella Sticks; The most disturbing part of my experience. I bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. I was grossed out but know that these things happen. When I reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. Hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?

We were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. The mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. Also, I don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. Also not worth hunting down service.

Needles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. If I were to ever come back, I would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights.",2015-05-18 00:43:41

Everything I've ever had is perfectly good Thai food--standard fare and exactly what you would expect.  And this is why I always find it a little weird that they charge a dollar or so more than a regular Thai place for completely standard Thai food.  Really, this is my only objection to this place.  I know the location is good and there aren't lots of Thai places around here, so I guess that's the reason for the mark-up.

I have never seen such a layout of multilingual menus before (in Miami it's just spanish lol). Plus the staff was very nice and made ordering easy. I had the carne mechada arepa and empanada with queso. It was piping hot and very good. The sauces were also excellent, not too watery or too thick. 

My only gripe is that I'm used to queso guayanes on the arepa, which is a very thick cut, semisoft cheese that doesn't quite melt - giving an extra texture to the arepa. I'm not sure what type of cheese they used here, but it was thin and melted through. It was good, but I have never had it like that before.

I believe Match Play Mondays is a new offering too. They match anyone's deal you bring in up to $100. I've gone many times for this deal and I hope they keep it going! 

The beer selection is most amazing- over 100 total between bottled & a rotating draft list. Brews include many local faves such as Joseph James Rye'd n Dirty, Big Dog's Dirty Dog IPA, Tenaya Creek Pilsner. There was an offering from Lovelady Brewing also when I was there recently. Other standouts I've had are Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Porter & local seasonals such as CraftHaus.

For 5 years I was flying SWA out of ABQ and for the past 8 years I have been flying SWA out of PHX.  The best thing about SWA is their people... They actually seem to care about their customers, especially in comparison to any other airline I have flown... And, I have flown on every domestic carrier! There have been several instances where this genuine concern became very apparent to this high mileage road warrior. I fly enough to have both A-List and the Free Companion Card. Once when an emergency came up, my wife had to return from PVD the day before I could return, after much consternation, a manager was brought to the ticket counter at the T. F. Green Airport in PVD and he went ahead and issued a ticket to my wife at No Charge, despite the fact that I was not going to take the same flight until the next day... Hooray for that manager in PVD! He did the right thing despite violating company policy.  

For people like me who travel on business as part of their regular weekly job duties, the fact that SWA does not penalize their fliers for changing tickets at the last minute is the most truly distinguishing official policy difference with other airlines.  There have been many times I have arrived to the airport several hours earlier than planned due to finishing work in less time than originally estimated.  If there are seats available on an earlier flight home, no problem, SWA will put you on the earlier flight without a $150 change fee like other airlines.  This is great, and it works when you are late as well!  

Despite being a former US Airways Chairman Preferred snob who swore he would never fly on the ""Southwest Bus"", SWA has become my carrier of preference to the point where I will fly into an airport further away from my local destination, so I can fly on Southwest instead of any of the other ""We Hate Our Passengers"" airlines!

I've gone to more expensive, fancier pizza places, and have discovered that a couple of those places here are ""hit or miss"".  At Nicantoni's, you  don't have to worry about that.  They hit the bullseye every time.

Not that I had trouble getting in but I did see the line and felt bad for some of the people standing in the thousand person+ line.  Once inside as expected it blows you away.  Easily the biggest place I've ever been to nightclub wise.  Amazing music/Dj's and dancers and environment.

My main problem was a little with the layout of the club.  It had a walkway where they had these huge bouncers (i mean of course they were big otherwise what's the point of being a bouncer right?!) standing in the middle trying to direct traffic to keep moving.  I understand the idea there but it effectivly was like taking the 405 freeway in LA and leaving only one lane open.  Traffic backs up and then everyone starts to get agitated.

The patio was where I spent most of my night which was amazing.  Very nicely decorated and there was enough room to breath and talk with the friends I went with.

The other problem I had which I expected was the pricing.  But as it is the newest and hottest club in vegas (and most likely on the west coast and maybe even all of north america! I duno) the drinks and everything was very expensive.  I guess people come to vegas to blow lots of cash but as a local I gotta stay on a regular daily budget.

I'd say well worth the experience, but it is a pain getting in so maybe try somewhere else unless you have a connection to jump the line.

Located just west of Desert Ridge Marketplace on the west side of Tatum. Menu essentially the same as the Scottsdale location. Otherwise same excellent pizza, service, atmosphere. Parking could be a problem at times. 
Fresh local ingredients, fast service, and family atmosphere are the hallmarks of Humble Pie. Crust is thick at the edges, thin in the center. As a former Chicagoan the adjustment to thin crust was much easier with this quality dining spot. Love their salads too.
 I recommend the pepperoni pizza because it is not topped with conflicting flavors. The Sausage and Fennel would be much better without the fennel. I realize American tastes have moved towards ""scented"" and ""sweeter"", but I have not. So don't be afraid to ask if the pizza you will be ordering has any non-traditional flavors. Would you order a Super Supreme Pizza Hut pizza and sprinkle mint or lavender on it? At this place they would, so beware before you order.  Plan to order 1 pizza per adult. If you order carry-out, it only takes about 12 minutes to make a to-go pizza.
My only actual complaint about H.P. is the cramped dining area. And when the booze is flowing heavy the place gets loud.

Wording on the menu can be a bit confusing... you can add ingredients (pizza toppings) but you cannot substitute. You should research the menu online before going here. And their Sunday closing time online is not correct, so if you're going late - call first.

If there was a building I needed to make a pilgrimage to and that represented my youth the most, it was and is MLG. 

I grew up not far, went to high school a few blocks away and spent many days there getting free tickets to watch the Marlies on Sundays, or when a buddy's dad would take me to watch Maple Leaf wrestling where I saw Hulk Hogan vs Volkoff, or the Bulldogs vs Studd and Bundy, or Harts vs Rougeaus and always, Iron Mike Sharp.

But there was also the many times I'd go and hang around outside the back doors hoping to see my hero Mike Palmateer, instead only to get autographs by Miroslav Frycer and Peter Inachek on my binder. 

Or when Michelle Oates (sister of Adam) for whatever reason, took me to go watch her brother play against the Leafs because I helped her in English class. I rarely got to see the actual Maple Leafs play.  Maybe a total of 4 times including twice in the final year, and my last time ever in there as an arena, seeing a playoff game loss by the Leafs.

Or just the times we got to go for a free skate or hockey tournaments. Or just going through the shops of Doug Ault knowing I'd never be able to buy a jersey of either Palmateer or Bunny Laroque. And god knows I never wanted to be Trees (Mark Laforest) or Ken Wregget or worse, Peter Ing.

I also got to see Team USA's women volleyball squad right after the Seoul Olympic games with my biggest crush Lianne Sato there, who autographed my Asic Tigers. I proceeded to have a great club season... on the bench with the Cabbagetown cabbages. I didn't want to ruin the shoes!

And then there was the time I almost saw the greatest upset of all times with Team Canada with Steve Nash and Rick Fox almost beating team USA, with Fox slipping sprawled on the floor with 3 seconds left down by 3 and turning over the ball. 

Or when my dad took me to my first ever visit inside MLG when I was 8 or 9 and it'd be the only sporting event he'd ever join me at, the Harlem Globetrotters. I remember, being in the greys. It was high up. Really high up. Or that same first time I'd ever been in the bathrooms and getting scared of troughs. 

Or even the time an aunt took me to see Disney on ice, in which I wasn't all that interested, but I knew my aunt had gone out of her way to take me. And I did grow up loving Mickey.

We each ordered our own burger and a beer and also added the oreo and peanut butter boozy milkshakes at the end.

The meal began with complimentary pizza seasoned popcorn and then our burgers and beers were next.  We each ordered a different burger (gold standard, rising sun, and caliente) and each added a fried egg (because why not).  The upgrade price for the sides was a little excessive at $2.50 for a side salad substitution, already on top of a $20 burger, but it is what it is.  Each burger was great and definitely required a fork and knife once the egg broke.  The milkshakes were a spectacle.  Not much booze in them but delicious nonetheless.

The first thing you notice after the inner decor is the low prices. A mini sub and chips and drink are just $5. And it's big enough for a nice lunch. You can go 10, 14 and 17 inch on the subs as well. I had a 14 inch sub and meal for just $8. Really pretty great deal.

I got an Italian sub which was made with 4 meats and a nice soft tube of Italian bread. The sandwich wasn't the best ever, but still tasty. This shop is about the meal package so definitely recommend the meal if you go. 

It's clear that locals favor the shop as it was well trafficked during my late lunch visit.

Loved the sticky rice. What an innovative idea! It has the flavour profile and texture of Thai Coconut Sticky Rice. Very Frozen Rice Pudding-esque. Points for deviating from the norm :)

The service unfortunately was just ""OK"" Not terrible, however not much enthusiasm was shown when serving us, which was a table of two. 

We decided to try two different pizzas. They do not bake pizzas with two different flavours. You have to order one per person. The portions are quite generous!! 
We ordered the ""Margarita"" which is a basic tomato sauce, with a thin layer of cheese and fresh basil. Ours had two tiny leaves of basil. Quite stingy if you ask me!
Our other pizzas was a cheese base with caramelized onions and bacon. The flavour combination was great! Very much on the salty side.. Too salty for my taste. The bacon was cooked to a nice crisp. The onions were nicely browned and caramelized. The cheese was very much salty with no flavour. 

All this sounds delicious so far, right? Was was wrong? First and foremost it's far too thin! This was paper thin and very very soggy! You needed two hands to hold it so the pizza wouldn't fall apart. The crust was missing a great crunch factor and also quite soggy as well.

My son the linguine with the same sauce. Both of the pastas  tasted like fiberboard, with one over cooked and the other under cooked, not al dente, just under cooked. The sauce was like a can of crushed tomatoes with some unfamiliar tasting hot peppers added. Could not taste any other herbs or spices, like basil, oregano, bay leaves. Just bland with a bit of heat.

I honestly could've gone without because I don't really crave this food too often. I definitely don't mind it though.  The food that is of course. 

Upon entering there is a line of course. Went fast and I hadn't made up my mind of what I wanted. So my friend ordered hers first and her sister then me. Even after they placed their order it took me a second to decide if I wanted a burrito or a bowl. I understand there is a line but as an employee you don't have to have a look of annoyance on your face its a bit rude. The girl also seemed
Annoyed when my friend asked for peppers and onions when she had already passed it down the line past the meat for other toppings. My friend told me its a no no to them but a customer should be able to add whatever even if it is past a certain section. The next employee also seemed to have an attitude too as she was putting everything on top of our bowls. Next was the cashier who seemed pissed off at the world. She asked if we wanted something to drink and we said we would just have water and even After paying she didn't hand us our cups so we asked. My friend even tipped $3 in the tip jar and I asked her why she did that when they were all extremely rude ?! She said I know I shouldn't have. After getting water we went outside to sit and the patio was a mess ! I know you can't control were birds drop their bowels but you can have the tables wiped and trash picked up off the floor. We went back in to sit and the tables that were clean were right next to the entrance/exit door ( pet peeve of mine to sit by the entrance/exit ) but most tables were dirty and there was only one couple eating in the dining area. Mostly everyone was taking their orders to go and it's pretty obvious why. The place was a mess ! 

The rude cashier came out to sweep and was sweeping close to the couple that was eating and they were very annoyed she was not only sweeping while they were eating but she had swept their feet which is a big no no in some cultures ! 

We asked to speak to the manager because my friend and her sister were employees of a chipotle not too long ago. They had told me their was no culture , the restraunt was dirty despite not being super busy ( in their book ) and that the customer service was horrendous. The manager came out 10 minutes later ! 10 minutes are you serious ?! He stuck up for his crew and said we were the first ones to complain or say something negative about the store or his crew. I find that completely crazy because if they operate the way they did today id be surprised if anybody came back. I told him I live close here and I would drive 7 miles out of my way if I wanted chipotle because my experience was that bad here. He didn't even seemed like he cared. Didn't offer us a free meal or even ask how he could fix the problem. I definitely wasn't trying to get a free meal but something would have been a nice gesture. Will definitely not come back here and I would definitely take this issue to corporate after the way he handled the problem and I'm not one to complain like this to the extent I take it to corporate but it was pretty bad.",2014-09-27 10:07:50

Okay, one more thing: Last night we tried the grilled sausages with beans, and I am adding them to my list of things I love here. The sausages are made in house, and are firm, thick and delicious. (Get your mind outta the gutter!) They sit atop what is best described as a white bean stew. I would order the beans alone for the comfort food moment they provided me. I was sopping up the bean juice with bread! 

One other oddity that was quickly corrected: We ordered a pizza half with two toppings and the other half with a different two toppings, and when the bill came, we were charged the full prize for 4 toppings. We said, ""That kinda sucks."" And, the waiter went to the manager, and he agreed and adjusted the total. Appreciate the attentive customer service for sure!",2013-02-01 19:36:21

The best nightclub by far! Their shows are even better than Rain Nightclubs acrobats. 

I went in here after work and in an hour I saw a guy beatboxing Party Rock Anthem,  a dude singing along to a burlesque show, and a bunch of crazy looking workers dressed in wacky costumes. If I could upload videos onto Yelp I would have showed you something that I recorded of what I mentioned before.

It's sort of small, and the entrance halls are deceptive. Once u get past the first corridor you'll find the main club, where it transitions from a haunted house into a 1930s Speakeasy.

All the girls are wearing female mafia suits, and all the guys look like Tony Montana. The music alternates between live acts and DJs. 

Oh, an I came in here during locals night. So anyone who lives in Vegas can enjoy this every Wednesday. Horrays! 

Way better than scumbag First Friday. Way better than crackhead Fremont!

Whether I eat in or get takeout the food has always exceeded my expectations. With that said, I will admit that I have only had a few items off the menu.  This is not normal for me as I love trying new things but for some reason Gasoline Alley makes me break my rule of changing it up.

First of all, my absolute favorite item on the menu is the A La Arami sandwich. It is Pepperoni, Salami and Cream Cheese with Lettuce and Tomato in a Pita. Don't be a Sissy and get the Bully size for $9.99. Yes the sizes are Bully and Sissy!  I don't know what it is about this sandwich but I get it pretty much every time I come here. One time I got the Greek Burger and it was pretty good but no A La Arami! The stuff the Pita so full of goodness that I promise you will not go away hungry!  The fries are also exceptionally tasty.  I enjoy the homemade chips and dip, onion rings, kraut balls and the Clam Chowder is to die for.  So after more then half a dozen trips those are the only items I've had and I'm fine with that. Although, there are easily over 20 deli style sandwiches to try, burgers, pizzas and desserts.  I have ordered a few beers but they don't have the biggest selections.

The decor is definitely a Route 66 Americana motive that works well in a deli/diner setting. There isn't much seating and it can be tight quarters. I've only waited once on a Friday night but at the same time I've never seen them not at least 75% full.  They seem to do a good business and I will definitely keep coming back!",2016-02-03 03:37:39

Like so many of the other, newer lounges in Vegas, the décor is pretty chic and modern.  While View Bar in Aria has a bright, plush look and The Chandelier in Cosmo keeps a classy, glamorous appearance, Lily Bar goes more for a dark, ""by candlelight"" type of vibe.  Tables and seating seemed relatively plentiful, and their DJ spun a diverse mix of songs.  Drinks seemed to run slightly on the high side ($11 or so for a Makers and ginger), but the 2-for-1 drink tickets we had more than evened it out.

From what I've read, I can see why other Yelpers had problems with Lily Bar.  However, we didn't run into the same problems...possibly because we were only there for an hour and relatively early on a Sunday night.  We saw a lot of free tables, the servers were relatively friendly (or perhaps, not unfriendly), and the drinks were fine.  Could be quite different on a weekend though.

They're not something I order often, but when I do I always to go for the flax seed bagel. Plus, they're only $5, which considering the portion size, is a great deal. 

As for the standard bagel bar, it's top notch. You can get cream cheese and a variety of toppings. One time I was standing in line and the girl in front of me ordered cream cheese, tomatoes, pickles and sprouts.

Although the food was good, without the Groupon our bill would have been $45 and the friend who I dined with wasn't even totally full at the end of the meal.

The food:

-Truffle Edamame $4: warm, buttery, flavorful, good amount of food, but too salty

-Pork Gyoza Soup $6: overpriced for what you get, you get 4 dumplings which are supposedly filled with soup and pork. unfortunately, the way our dumplings were made they stuck to each other and the bottom of the plate so they ripped open when we picked them up and the ""soup"" spilled out. only 1 dumpling made it to my mouth intact and the soup was alright, nothing to write home about

-Ginger Mint Duck Salad $9: good value - you get a few slices of duck meat on top of a bed of shredded cabbage, the dressing was very good, tasted like a traditional Vietnamese salad -- I would come back to this place for that salad, but watch out for the spice. I like spicy and this had my mouth tingling for a little while after

-House Dynamite with Chicken $11: okay value, but they should serve it with rice or recommend that you order a side of rice when you place your order. rice is cheap so it's annoying that they skimp on this. the other reviews saying this dish is spicy are NOT true. I barely tasted any spice at all, even though the plate was covered in red pepper flakes, they weren't hot. I liked the assortment of veggies, including baby corn, that they used in this dish

-Mango Monkey Martini $11: yuck. I'm not a big alcohol drinker and this was way too strong for my taste and sort of reminded me of medicine. my friend thought it was okay, but also really strong. I don't think ginger and mango are the right flavors to mix together.

But get there, we did!
First of all, I'm a damn dumpling fanatic.  I don't care whose cuisine we're talking about, if they have a dumpling, I'm trying it.  I asked our server about the Gyoza at Yuzu Kitchen and she said that they were her favorites.  Say no more!  Put me down for the gyoza!  GBD(Golden, Brown and Delicious!) and moist and flavorful and freshly made and tasty and porky!  Yuzu Kitchen's gyoza rank up there with some of the best that I have had in San Francisco's and New York City's Chinatown neighborhoods. (I hate when restaurants serve ""frozen"" gyoza and try to pawn them off as house-made.  Yech!)

As far as our entrees, me and my LPIC were going to go with the ramen but decided to go with the ""Da Shoyu Mein"" at the last minute. Ramen noodles with pulled pork, Korean pickled bean sprouts, scallions, mushrooms and a 30 minute egg!  What form of madness is this?  Crazy goodness!  I swore off all forms of ramen noodles after college. (When the only thing that you can afford is 10 packs for a dollar ramen noodles and you eat them almost EVERY DAY for several years, you would swear them off too!)  However, Yuzu Kitchen made me a believer and we are already contemplating eating our way through the menu. (Just to make sure that they don't have anything bad on their menu.)  And while the space is small, it is truly artfully and elegantly designed.  Tres chic!

I made reservations a week in advance, mentioned the Groupon I had purchased earlier and got a confirmation in my Email. The place wasn't crowded at all on Sunday night. My party of 4 were welcomed and were given a choice to sit where we pleased. I absolutely adored the atmosphere and decor. It's a quite classy place, certainly good for professional meetings and celebrations. 

I had the cauliflower soup for appetizer, which was quite creamy and rich, garnished with olive oil. My friend tried the buffalo Mozzarella and tomatoes for appetizer and he liked it, even though I didn't like the cheese when I tried it. For main course I had the Alberta bison striploin and it was perfectly cooked medium, just the way I like it. Finally, for desert I had a milk chocolate mousse, which was alright, and not too sweet.

Which was understandable because we came in so late. When we walked in a elderly man came and greeted us. He does not speak much English but he was very sweet. Many people say he has bad customer service, but I don't see it. Yes there is a language barrier but you can work through it. We told him what we wanted, 3 or these, 3 of those etc. He repeated what we wanted back to us and while he was taking the donuts out he repeated it again. Which was so cute. He even added some donut holes on top of the donuts we ordered. 

Now to the donuts. They make it fresh and were pretty good. I felt like they focus on the donuts and not the glazed. To be honest I don't like it when my donuts are overly glazed and this is not the case at all. I know it's not what the donuts everyone else is used to including me and they probably marked them down a star or two. The donuts he makes are light and butterly.

Been here once before, but wasn't much memorable back then. Felt the same way the second time around. We were immediately given menus and water, which was cool. Took a little while for someone to take our order though, but no biggie.

Lots of different meat options for the pho. But felt that the broth itself was almost flavorless. Perhaps because it was a freshly cooked batch and didn't have enough time to steep? Who knows. But the side of herbs of basil, sprouts, lime, and jalapenos were very fresh though.  Spring rolls were also big and plump and a filling appetizer for two people. Just wish it had been cut in half to make it easier to eat.

Service wasn't exactly warm, but adequate. Waters were refilled without having to ask. No one checked in on us at the end though or dropped off a check, so we just paid at the counter. (Not sure what the normal protocol was).

My friend and I came here for lunch yesterday.  She recommended that I buy only half a salad.  That was a good recommendation as I left most of it.  I ordered the turkey cranberry salad.  There were a lot of chunks of white turkey meat, cranberries, Spring Mix for the greens, onion slices, and mushrooms.  My friend thinks the salad also included tofu.  I don't know.  What I do know is that I would have liked twice as much dressing.  I also know that it was hard to eat with a small plastic fork and a small plastic knife, especially since the bowl was so deep and so light  (plastic).  The reason I left so much of my salad isn't because it was too filling; it's because it was too damn hard to eat.  The salad came with a single slice of bread.

They have a nice selection of soft drinks.  The parking lot is pretty easy to maneuver; but it can be hard to get into if you have to make a left across Eastern coming out of Anthem.  Just be patient and be safe.  When you leave, be patient.  The place was clean enough; and the staff efficient.

We had a group of 5 people that wanted to go out to dinner and hang out on a Saturday night. Fran, one of the friends, called the restaurant and asked if they took reservations. The lady said that they did not and it was first come first serve but gave no indication of how long that could be. She said, ""I am sure we can get you in soon."" If you hear something like that you just assume that the wait is not that long. Well....we got there and the wait was an hour and a half or more. Waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhtttt??? Why wouldn't you say that over the phone? Not impressed at all. But we decided to stay. The only good thing is that the left side of the Church Brew Works is no reservations. So, if you were wily enough you could just wait for a table to open up and hope you get there fast enough to grab it.

Good news, I'm like a wily cat and grabbed a table, before they even cleared it, and we were seated 20 minutes or less after we got there. Big accomplishment! So we sat down and ordered some drinks and just looked over the menu. 

That is when the server issue started. Our server was no where to be seen throughout the entire dinner experience. And even to get the check took forever. I did not see many servers and even saw two managers helping out so I just assumed they must have been short staffed.  But that and not being told that there was that long of a wait bumped them to two stars.

Food:
Cup of French Onion Soup:
This was actually really good. This soup was really well made and was not salty at all. It had a great flavor to it. I really enjoyed the croutons and the melted cheese on the top. I wish there was a little more cheese and less of the croutons but overall it was well made.

Lettuce Wraps:
Diced southwest rubbed chicken breast tossed in a soy ginger reduction. Served with julienne carrots and zucchini noodles in an Asian sweet and sour sauce, crushed peanuts, and bibb lettuce.
Umm...the chicken was served cold. The chicken was not warm it was cold. That is not something that we were expecting at all. When I think lettuce wraps I usually have had the chicken hot/warm. Not these one they were served cold. The chicken was also in chunks and not ground. I am on the fence about that. While it was easier to handle not many people could share this dish because the were not many chunks. 

Side salad:
This side salad was huge. I was impressed with the portion size. The blue cheese dressing was also on point. I enjoyed this the most. 

Pizza: Wild Boar BBQ
Slow roasted pulled wild boar, Dunkel bbq sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese.
The pizza was so salty it was almost inedible to both Chris and I. AND it was $22. Nothing about this pizza was good. The pizza had too much sauce on it so it was floppy and each slice fell if you lifted it. The cheese over took the pizza and was choking. There was not a lot of the corn or red onions to counter act the taste of the bbq sauce that was not appetizing at all. And the boar was too salty as said before. I ate one slice, Chris ate one, and we ended up giving a $22 pizza away to someone who said they might want to eat it. Ugh... disappointing for sure.

1.  Selection - They do have a great selection of furniture, TV, carpet and electronics. Not so much on appliances.

2.  Sales/Service - The sales team are very aggressive and I have encountered some really goods ones and a lot of arrogant or pushy ones too. I just ignore the pushy ones and come back to buy from another later. Why come back, convenience and selection.

3.  Prices - Not bad, not great. 

4.  Store - Very nice set up and lots of great stuff. I have bought my fair share of goods here from the ""display"", so they are quite effective for sure.

5.  Bad Experience - My personal experience at the store is hit or miss. more misses. I used to come here with my family to browse and see what was available on a Saturday. One Saturday, they were giving out balloons to all the kids. I asked for one for each of my three kids and basically waited 10 minutes and no one could help me, or told me we had to get it at the end of our visit and not the beginning. So, I tried it and after 45 minutes we left and asked for balloons and they said no. I asked why all the other kids had them when they ENTERED the store but we had to wait... No positive answer.

6.  Bad Experience - Went there with the family when they were giving out hot dogs and drinks as a way to drive traffic.  Nothing was available and I was a bit annoyed.  I should have known better.

7.  Bad Experience - I complained to the store in writing about my experiences. NO RESPONSES on two occasions. Just a complaint on how to improve.

8.  Bad Experience - Went to buy a Fridge, huge 65"" flat screen, Microwaves and a 32"" flat screen for the office. Was dressed in work boots and kinda dirty. Most of the sales staff ignored me and turned the other way. I had to seek out a sales person, a newbie and bout over 10k from him in 15 minutes.  Why do I feel like I have to do all the work.

They have Left Hand Milk Stout (one of my favorite beers) on tap.  Without that little bit of joy, it might have only been 3 stars, but the fact that I saw the Left Hand right when I walked in set the tone for the rest of the, uh, 20 minutes we were there.

They are about $2.00 each.  Here is how they were.............

Milk Chocolate Chip-  These were pretty solid!  They were crisp on the outside, soft in the middle, and tasted great.  They weren't too sweet and they were a decent size for the price.  4 stars.

Peanut Butter-  These looked good, but unfortunately fell short in taste.  They had a crisp exterior and were softer inside.  Not as soft as the other 2 cookies as they were more dense, but still softer than the initial outer crust.  I ate the whole cookie, but I wasn't that impressed and would not buy this one again.  Wasn't nasty, but wasn't good either.  2.5-3 stars.

Double Chocolate with Sea Salt-  This was the best of the bunch!  By far!  This cookie was great!  Crisp initial bite, then soft and gooey like a brownie!  The sea salt complimented the chocolate well and this cookie was flat out awesome!  5 stars...easy!

I enjoyed everything about it, from the large, comfortable booth with royal blue, aqua, and lavender fabric in which we sat; the immediate pouncing on us after we were seated by water carrier, cocktail waitress, and server in quick succession; the snappy, blue and white, mini-skirted uniforms of the servers; the swirling neon blue and pink tubes of light overhead and tube of red light circling around the dining room below; the immense menu; to the wonderfully tasty and generously sized food that Diane and I enjoyed on a recent Tuesday night.  And, as we entered and left the restaurant, every served dish I saw on other diners' plates looked massive, well crafted, and tasty.

I began our late dinner with a bowl of Beef Barley Soup.  It contained cubed beef, barley, mushroom slices, tomato, celery, and a real tasty, oily beef broth.  The only negative is that the mushrooms appeared to be of the canned variety.  

An excellent Spinach Salad with egg, fresh spinach leaves, bacon, and a Catalina Dressing that tasted like Hot Bacon Dressing was next, followed by a BLTA packed with bacon, red tomato, lettuce, an ample smear of mayonnaise, and huge, beautifully green and yellow, cool chunks of perfectly ripe avocado on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread as I had requested.  Numerous French Fries were also on the plate, because I had forgotten to order desired Potato Salad, which was an included alternative, along with a choice of cottage cheese, onion rings, or a fruit cup.  So, just a little belatedly, I ordered and paid for a side of Potato Salad.  When it arrived in a large teardrop dish, my work in dispatching this large side, along with my jam-packed sandwich, began.  But it was easy to do, for this excellent creamy white, mayonnaise-based Dill Potato Salad with skin-on Red Potatoes and celery was simply delicious.  The Fries were good, but I enjoyed the Potato Salad more.

Diane, meanwhile, raved about the 3 large and juicy Arctic Cod fillets and the incredible amount of crisp deep-fried Curly Fries that covered her platter and constituted an order of Icelandic Fish and Chips.  She also very much liked her excellent, rich Hot Chocolate with Whipped Cream.  As usual, I finished all of my meal, and Diane ate what she could, and had the rest packed for lunch at home.

But we were by no means done.  I had my eye on another Peppermill offering as soon as I read through the gargantuan menu, and Diane was game, as well.  So, to cap off a fine dinner, we ordered a Colossal Hot Fudge Sundae to share.

And, this was some sundae.  Besides a generous supply of French Vanilla Ice Cream in a large and high elongated glass sundae dish, this treat featured mini-chocolate chips, chopped peanuts, a mountain of whipped cream, an obligatory cherry on top, and a load of warm and sweet Hot Fudge (see pic)--likely four times the amount of Hot Fudge one will find in the average Hot Fudge Sundae served elsewhere.  I asked our server how many scoops of ice cream were in our sundae, and she replied that normally 3 scoops are included but this was the first one she had ever made, and because she wanted us to be pleased with it, she had put in FIVE SCOOPS!  I highly recommend this dish--but not for just 1 person!  It was so wonderfully good that Diane and I finished it all--but just barely! 

This was a great meal with very friendly and mostly great service.  Only my specially ordered Potato Salad was initially forgotten temporarily, and I had to ask once for an Iced Tea refill.  Otherwise our server checked on us several times during our meal to make sure all was well and we were not wanting for anything. 

We peeked inside the Fireside Lounge before we left, and it looked like a great romantic place to have drinks with a special partner around the fire pit.

A couple other pluses about the Peppermill are that it is open 24/7, and access to lot parking is easy right off Las Vegas Boulevard just in front of the restaurant.  I expect to become a regular here, and work my way through the vast and enticing menu.

Haven't been in about 6 months and had pho today and it was the worst pho I've ever had.  The noodles were different from before - really thick rice noodles.  I prefer the thinner ones.  The beef was more fat than beef.  And the pieces that weren't fatty tasted kind of sour like it was old.  I will never eat here again.,2014-05-14 00:02:00

I have been to Peculiar Rabbit twice--once for dinner and once for brunch. We decided to try it out after a co-worker recommended going for a few drinks but once I saw Chicken & Waffles and Disco Fries on the menu I decided I needed to try the food as well.

The building itself, dining areas, bars, and rooftop are splendid and I will definitely be returning solely for the sunset view of the city. Caution: Be sure to check the weather, our first visit was plagued by sporadic raindrops, which sent us running under the awning a few times.

The drinks are strong and the craft beer selection was impressive. I enjoyed my Bloody Mary, but was slightly annoyed to have to have the spice subdued. Not a big deal.

We had a very difficult time with our waiter. Bless his heart, he was extremely friendly and admitted he was new, but made many errors with our order and had to be reminded of drink orders a few times.

The disco fries were the exact over-indulging, heart attack-inducing deliciousness you'd expect. If you're looking for comfort food, these are your answer.

I ordered the chicken & waffles and was disappointed that the waffle wasn't light and fluffy but overcooked and flaky. Long story short, the flakiness of the chicken (which alone was not too bad, but again, overcooked) paired with the overcooked, flaky chicken turned my meal into underwhelming flaky, overcooked mess. Thank god for the maple glaze, which may have been the best part of the dish. In summary, I should have ordered the shrimp & grits.

I wasn't keen on returning for brunch only a week and half later but were meeting friends and didn't really have a choice. I ordered the eggs benedict, a predictable choice for me.  Hollandaise was bland, shaved ham was flavorless and the hash-browns did not taste homemade. I was not very pleased with my meal, but to be fair, I tend to be overcritical when it comes to eggs benny's and very rarely am I impressed. :)

Overall this is a fun place to grab a few drinks or watch the sunset on the rooftop but the food seems to fall a bit flat. Too bad, I really wanted to like it.",2014-02-12 00:35:44

The car had a known issue with the vapor lock, where the car automatically shuts down when the temperature is hot. They sold her this car in JULY in LAS VEGAS. THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE THAT THEY DID NOT DISCLOSE. So dishonest. So now she's stuck with a car that she can't drive. 

This is a review strictly of the finance guy, Stratton. He is the most condescending, rude person working here. I was here with my mother, who was buying a new car, paying with cash. Stratton was so rude and off-putting that we were ready to walk out and go to a new dealership. 

My mom, who is over 70, didn't have an email address. So Andy, the first salesman we dealt with, just made up a generic random email address and put it in her file. A quick Google search showed me that the email belonged to another person. I asked them to change it to my email address, and they wouldn't do it. Super unethical.

We ordered the build your own 16-inch organic pizza with extra mozzarella and half of the Zo's chopped salad. The sauce and the cheese on the pizza were so delicious--very high quality, fresh-tasting with lots of flavor. The salad was also excellent. My daughter loved everything. The only thing I didn't love was the crust on the pizza. It was perfectly fine, and my daughter liked its crunchiness, but I prefer my crust a little chewier (we didn't order the gluten-free or I would totally understand the lack of chewiness). Service was also very good.

Yes, their prices are a bit higher than your average pizza place. The total for our dinner was $30.50 (before tax and tip), and we were STUFFED with leftovers. People, organic, vegan, and gluten-free ingredients are EXPENSIVE!! I know this because my husband is gluten-free and I try to buy organic for my kids.

There was a lot of seating available, including many tables for two and cozy booths.  We settled in at a table and our waitress told us it was margarita night so we both ordered the lime flavor ($5.99).  The drinks arrived in massive glasses requiring both hands to hold.

For the meal, we order the talapia with Greek salad ($13.99) and the avacado sandwich with sweet potato fries ($11.99).  The sandwich was probably better than the fish which was just a slab of salty, slightly burned talapia on a bed of salad consisting of mostly onions and green peppers.

It makes an evening of arts and culture just that much nicer to enjoy.

The facility, adjacent and accessible from Founders Hall, is (relatively) new and sparkling throughout.  The lobby spaces are very open and offer a number of modern chairs and benches to provide seating to patrons.  A wide spiral staircase connects you to your level of seats and each level has a concession bar offering beer, wine, spirits, water, and a few snacks.  Prices are a little steep, but not so bad as at your typical movieplex.  Bonus tip: you can pre-order and pay for a drink during intermission.  When you walk out, there is a side table with your drink and order slip waiting for you.  So convenient and easy, as your time waiting in line is all but eliminated.

I also think the seating inside the theater is very good, from most all levels.  If anything, the Orchestra seats may be close to the stage but require angling your neck up to see the action.  The seats in both the grand tier and mezzanine levels allow you to look down on the action but do offer unobstructed views.

The staff, located in the mint green jackets, are literally everywhere and available to help you find the most convenient door and path to your seats.  If you ever have a problem with patrons around you, a discreet word to an usher will quickly remedy the issue.  Bonus tip 2: they also sell parking passes for $5 before, during, and after the show.  There are 4 decks near the BPAC that accept the coupons.  The staff will check your parking ticket to make sure you parked in a qualifying deck and will then sell you a $5 ticket to get out after the show is over.  I can't say how helpful this is- you just feed the coupon into the gate and off you go- no digging for cash or waiting for a credit card receipt to slow you down.  

Bravo to this facility and their staff- they make a nice evening out just that much more enjoyable.",2011-03-22 01:42:43

Not the consumer's fault.  It's poor buyers, lack of understanding of your clientele and who you are trying to attract.  What a shame.",2017-02-10 22:48:07

The first horrible time they didn't have like 80% of the menu and I had only found out after I paid and ordered because the cashier was ill informed on inventory. And then they took away 2 of the better things they offered (curly fries and popcorn chicken), although replacing the popcorn chicken with seitan nuggets.  I literally cannot tell you the last time I returned something at a restaurant, and these were just that gross that I had to.  They looked nothing like the picture they advertised and tasted like burnt flour in dirty fryer oil.  And while I returned them I had waited at least 5 minutes before the employees had finished gossiping to notice me standing at the counter to help me out.  Granted they were nice and let me get something else.  Ugh get it together.  On top of that, two big dead bugs just chillin in the bathroom that had no toilet paper... not the greatest experience.  And there was horrible loud music playin.. simple plan? My chemical romance? Some emo stuff playing just too loud to hear your thoughts, or someone standing in front of the register for 5 minutes for that matter ;)

The facility is a cool historic house on East Blvd - I think Georgia didn't even know she was at the vet. She was very relaxed there, even while getting her nails clipped.

My friend made reservations in advance for a party of six people. Our hostess led us to the back of the restaurant to a cozy booth with additional chairs on the outskirts, which accommodated our party nicely. There weren't many people dining there at 7:00pm on a Wednesday, which was nice because we did receive a lot of attentive service from the waitstaff. 


FOOD
+ Oreo Milkshake: Started the evening off with a tall glass of this shake made from crushed Oreos and Bailey's Irish Cream. If you're concerned that you're going to receive a mouthful of booze, you won't. There was only a hint of Bailey's that I could detect. Rather than one ingredient dominating over the other, both blended nicely to create a creamy, concoction. 

+ Rising Sun Burger: Order the optional egg with this burger. Trust me. It's what makes it bomb. But even if you don't like eggs, this burger is solid. A little on the dense side. I wasn't sure if that was due to the thickness of the meat patty or the tempura avocado and yam toppings, but I had a tough time taking bites. I can't say if I enjoyed the sweetness of the teriyaki glaze. I think there was too much of it slathered onto my Kobe beef patty. Just a light amount brushed over the patty would've been perfect for my tastes. Other than that criticism, that didn't stop me from eating the entire burger and the side of fries.

SERVICE
Great service. Our server was friendly and patient, and she even placed a birthday candle on top of my friend's Drunken Monkey shake. Nice touch.

My husband & I had date night planned with a drive up to the restaurant on Saturday night. We arrived a bit earlier that anticipated (around 5:30pm) so it was fine that we didn't have a reservation however by the end of our dinner, we saw that other guests weren't able to get a table on the patio since the tables were reserved & most of the tables inside were also full so I'd recommend calling in ahead of time for anything after 6:00pm.

On to the food itself - it was good! We overheard the owner talking to a couple other groups & he was saying how all the dishes on the menu were his wife's family recipes. They really seemed to have items that took a while to develop flavor, like stews. Our server made some recommendations so we went ahead with a few of those -- Pao De Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread) to start and Moqueca de Peixe (Seafood Stew), & Feijoada (Black Bean Stew) for dinner.

The Cheese Bread was different than I expected but good. It had a very mild cheese flavor & wasn't super cheesy but still tasty, it came out freshly baked, piping hot! My husband & I agreed that we both liked the Seafood Stew more than the Black Bean Stew due to the flavor. There were large shrimp & a sizable piece of fish in this dish making it very filling. The Black Bean Stew did come with multiple items to eat together which was different, my husband enjoyed it.

If I were in the area, I'd consider stopping by but probably wouldn't go out of my way again. The service was a bit slow but still attentive, no complaints. We were in a bit of a hurry to leave but if I do go back, I'll save space for dessert - specifically, the flan!",2017-10-14 07:17:27

Well, I couldn't stop eating it & didn't crave the pita! My friends all got different kabob entrees and said it was excellent, very tasty and tender. 2 full skewers of meat that is generously cut. I had the lamb shank entree and altho Tristen (excellent server, btw!) told me their rice is GF, I went with the spicy lemon cubed potatoes. And let me tell you....I'm so happy I have leftovers! The meat was juicy, falling off the bone & was a nice portion. Not over seasoned or over sauced. Grilled vegies were fresh and cooked perfectly. The potatoes were also delicious, which I was very happy about since everyone raves about their cauliflower hot appie which I couldn't have (fried=gluten).

We also found out that this is a sister restaurant to Pizza Rock from downtown (cool! We like pizza rock!)

It's a small little place, pretty cozy, but cute. 
We enjoyed the El hefe on draft (from banger brewery downtown!) and started with the meatballs. Those were probably the highlight of our meal. The meatballs were delicious, made from beef, pork and veal, but that sauce really kicks them up a notch. 

For our main, we shared the Dillinger pizza. It's a deep dish, topped with chicken, onion, artichoke hearts, three different cheeses (so it says, but I couldn't tell if the cheddar was on it) among other toppings, but it didn't have sauce. The first few bites were delicious, but that's about all I could have! The pizza is hugeeeee and trust me, we've had our fair share of deep dish pizzas, but after it was all said and done, we decided it was just OK. Maybe the staff hyped it up for us, maybe we believed it when it said it won best pizza in 2014 or maybe we are just being too tough on them? Either way, it wasn't our favorite.

I don't think I need to describe the food as it was all the standard fare you'd get at every other Mexican restaurant in town so I won't detail it. It was flavorful and was served hot though so that's a plus.

The service..well, it was just kind of indifferent. Our server didn't greet us, didn't seem interested in serving us, and was about as indifferent as someone can be who is working in the service industry and earns tips. I was rather surprised given that this is Scottsdale and you really do need to work a little to earn a tip.

Came for the $38 dinner and got what I'd consider a 4 star experience by Winterlicious standards.

First off, I want to say that this places interior has been wonderfully styled. The oldschool booths but modern styling, contrasting industrial concrete vs wood accenting and well designed lighting, and even though the place is so big it didn't sound crazy loud.
The audio nerd in me especially loved the mixing board collage outside the bathrooms with the male and female phono jacks for bathroom signs. 

Food wise, I went with the Pork Tacos, Smoked Brisket & St. Louis Pork Ribs, and then the Cheesecake. Everything was quite good. The brisket was super tender, the ribs cooked well with tasty sauces to apply, and the cheesecake had blueberry compote on top of the somewhat ""more cake-like than cream cheese-like"" cheesecake. 
My date had the seafood salad, which was the only thing that missed the mark on our visit,  and the blackened sea bass which received full marks. 

Beer menu isn't the best but did have one craft beer on draught, a tasty ESB by Collingwood. Otherwise it was mostly Inbev and big brand options (Goose Island. Stella, Mill Street) aside from some other bottles of varying originality. 

All in all, I'm glad I came and would recommend it for anyone looking for high quality barbecue. The price will be a bit more than a lot of other bbq joints, but the added niceness of the place and high quality service levels make it easy to see where your money is going.",2017-01-30 14:52:35

After we discovered our daughter had multiple life threatening food allergies...we felt our options were pretty limited to just Disney---as they are the best at handling food allergies. I took a huge leap out of my comfort zone, as a parent to trust in Chef Eric and the entire staff at Gainey Ranch to have compassion and genuine care for my child....and I am so beyond blessed to share the experience we had. You have truly gained lifelong guests and many, many referrals for the rest of our life. 3 months before our stay..I was able to speak with Chef Eric personally. HE  assured me he would make her stay enjoyable and told me how much he takes food allergies seriously. The week before our stay we spoke via email and assured me again of his understanding. Upon check in, we were greeted by Chef Eric and the restaurant managers and sou chefs. They asked what her allergies were, what she liked to eat and assured her a relaxing trip and most importantly , a safe trip. They shook her hand and at that moment .... I knew it would be okay. Every stop at a restaurant in the resort, poolside and even room service was taken SO seriously. Each person knew her by NAME  (and not her label of allergies...) and knew her needs. She was able to eat whatever she wanted and for that, we thank you. For her to feel included, like her brothers and to not be limited ...is  a HUGE thing for a child with food allergies. We had the most enjoyable family trip that we have ever had in a long time and we enjoyed the resort, the pool, the staff and most of all....the compassion and stand up, class act of every single staff member  at the Gainey Ranch.

The Vegas location used to be in the MGM, and now it is hidden away in an offshoot mall near Planet Hollywood. There wasn't much foot traffic, and we got a seat right away.

First off, it reminded me of Denver's Casa Bonita--but not in a good way. Lots of small rooms with fake jungle greenery and mechanical animals blaring away in the background. Too bad there were no waterfalls or cliff divers to take our minds off the food.

I'm not a food snob, but my meal was WAY overcooked. I had the Parilla Yucatan plate off their seasonal menu: bacon-wrapped shrimp, grilled chicken topped with cheese, and mahi mahi topped with mango salsa. The seasoning was great, but the proteins were as tough as burlap. Nowhere near worth the $22 price tag.

My friends ordered mozzarella sticks, a cup of clam chowder, fried shrimp, and the jungle steak and shrimp. They seemed pretty pleased, but the food looked pretty pedestrian to me. And even though we didn't have any alcoholic drinks, the meal was over $100.

They are tourists. It's a tourist trap. And they were happy, so I'm glad for them. But with so many other great restaurants in Vegas, I know I will never be back.

To be honest, after reading the reviews and knowing this restaurant group, I was expecting a bit of fun. I would describe it as more somber than anything. But our server did well with asking if everything tasted good. 

We ordered some drinks to get started. While $16 can seem a little steep for a cocktail (and yes, I know this is a nicer restaurant, I'm just tired of the $15 to $16 cocktail), our drinks were really tasty and seemed to have been made with skill and attention. Side note, the bar area is beautiful and the Oak Manhattan is exceptional. 


We each ordered burrata salad, one person in our party got the vegetable soup, though they didn't actually order it and had just asked the server what the soup of the day is. To be fair, the person who asked what the soup of the day was had mostly lost their voice a little so it wasn't a big deal. The burrata though--I could eat the burrata salad every day of my life! It was so good! 


For the main course everyone except me ordered the filet and I got the 16 oz. ribeye. We also ordered several sides. For sides we got the pork belly mac n cheese, the assorted mushrooms, collard greens, and truffle frites. None of the sides were bad, none unfortunately none of them were all that memorable either. About half our table wasn't big on the dry, hard, chunks of pork belly in the mac. I personally thought it was delicious. My steak came out medium, but I had ordered it medium rare. I did expect a perfect cook here for a $54 steak. This was not a huge deal and I didn't want them to throw it away as waste, so I didn't mention it to the server.

I didn't try the Malabar fish angoori, but was told that it was delicious and very flavourful. It is also one of the restaurant's signature dishes.
 
For dessert, we shared the gulab jamun, which tasted just right and not too sweet. The servers were a little reserved, but were still quite warm and the food was served quite quickly.

the HH menu was nice and simple - $3 for a few food items, sangria, well drinks and i think domestic beers? I'm glad we tried them out during HH because everything was just ok, probably not worth the full price. 

the pizza was really good, and a great deal at $3 for a sizeable piece w/ 1 topping. i'd definitely go back for the bacon/pancetta slice. pastas were cooked perfeclty al dente, but spicy meat sauce was pretty bland. the classic meatball was really good - juicy and well seasoned. 

i tend to gravitate toward sweet drinks, but the white sangria was too sweet even for me. possibly because it's made w/ moscato wine, but the peach taste was overwhelming. the drink menu mentioned the sangria was full of boozy grapes, but ours only had 1 piece of bruised apple and 1 piece of pear. so looks like no grapes for HH cheap@sses.

When we got there, the place was bigger than expected as the views from the outside made the restaurant look very tiny. It wasn't busy at all and the mood was very relaxing and quaint, especially if you were on a date. All the other customers who were there were in pairs, it was a nice morning breakfast place that wasn't too noisy and had lots of room for chit-chatting.

Panagio's close at 4pm, so they do have a lunch section, including sandwiches, burgers, poutine and grilled cheese, to name a few and a dessert section!

V ordered a usual breakfast consisting of 3 eggs, 3 sausages (with choice of bacon or ham as well), homefries, fruits and toast. I've decided to stray away from that path and try something new for once and got eggs benedict. As it was my first time eating eggs benedict, I have to say that I do not enjoy it as much. The hollandaise sauce was too sweet for both our liking, and I'm not a fan of ham either.. sadly. They did give 5 eggs for my Eggs Benny and around 3 pieces of ham. I absolutely love their homefries as they were slightly crispy on the sides. The fruits were a joke compared to other breakfast places that offer fruits like Cora's - as shown above, they had only given 1 slice of orange and cantaloupe for both our dishes.

There was only one waitress going around, and her name was Lisa. She was very nice and was very attentive as she was ready to fill our water glasses up as soon as they were low. Our total came around $20 (including tax) - V's was about $7-8 whereas mine was about $10-11. However, they do not have a cash register(??) as I saw her going to the counter and pulling change out of a pouch instead of using an actual cash register... They do have a POS system as that was how Lisa did our orders. So, quite confused on that part.

From time to time, I will come back here for more food and I do enjoy the ambiance of the place, but personally, I will not go for their eggs benedict again. I guess I just don't appreciate the taste of eggs benedict.

He is also determined to make as many facets of Calistro locally influenced, all the way down to the pecan wood trimmings from a local Arizona retailer.

Now, to the food! Each food item is noticeably prepared with the freshest ingredients. Therefore, if you are used to eating foods with more processed ingredients, the food may seem to lack that belly busting punch. We ate appetizers, main course and desert. I left feeling satisfied, but not ill. I highly recommend the chicken, flatbread and creme brulee (butterscotch, not butterscotchy, but just a hint). Also, they offer their deserts for $5 and are a reasonable portion - I often thought restaurants should do cheaper and smaller deserts and patrons would be more likely to get that final course.

Chicken balls, chicken fried rice and ginger beef. Except if I had had Bill's, the rest would've been spoiled for me after that! And now... this will be the case.

Shrimp sizzling rice
lemon chicken
egg rolls

Aïe, aïe, aïe!!! Quelle expérience extraordinaire! Ma meilleure amie et moi avons décidé de se gâter pour nos anniversaires en se payant un petit souper au Europea et MTL à table est certainement le moment le plus accessible pour le faire.

Du début à la fin, le service était impeccable. Courtois, bien informé et extrêmement professionnel. Le nec plus ultra! La serveuse s'est même assuré qu'il n'y avait aucune allergie alimentaire avant de commencer le service.

Un menu était prédéterminé pour l'événement et je crois qu'ils ont vraiment mis le doigt dessus, tout les choix étaient PARFAITS!! Dès le départ, nous avons reçu un assortiment de bouchées. Boeuf séché, cigare de fromage et pop corn aux truffes (j'en mangerait un sac format cinéma de celui-là! Ensuite, nous avons reçu un Cappuccino de crème de homard, purée de truffe avec du pain chaud et des beurres maison. Absolument fabuleux. Tellement onctueux et ""homardeux"" que je ne saurais décrire mon expérience! Ensuite, un carpaccio de veau de lait du Québec avec une crémeuse au thon parfumé et mesclun de pétales de fleurs, très beau et surtout très bon. La meilleure partie du repas selon moi! Après ça, nous avons reçu un velouté de topinambour et porcinis avec du foie gras au torchon à la râpe. Ma copine n'aime pas les champignons alors j'en ai hérité et c'est tant mieux, c'était délicieux! Et ça continue, (j'aurais jamais dû manger le pain haha) on reçoit un Terre et mer d'un croustillant de langoustine et poitrine d'une poule de Cornouaille, perso j'aurais pris juste des langoustines, la poule c'était bon, mais sans plus.

We started off with some snazzy blackened green beans - nicely seasoned and delicious. I had the camelback burger (no bun), green salad and was surprisingly tasty, cooked to my exact medium rare temperature. Friends had the Caesar kale salad with chicken and orange chicken wok. Both were okay.

So many of us have tried the so called Chinese food in Chinese restaurants all over the world. However, many people do not realize that the food in those restaurants is actually not authentic Chinese! So when I was invited to join one of my wonderful Chinese friends to try authentic Chinese food, I gladly accepted. We gathered a big group of people from work so that we could try many different dishes. 
Arriving there, we could see that the restaurant was packed with people, mostly Chinese families. Inside, I could only hear mandarin/kantonese being spoken, even by the staff. On the walls are colorful papers with Chinese sign on, what I'm guessing would be the different dishes on the menu. 
Our friend ordered 8 different dishes and quickly after, we got out first dish together with hot tea. The first dish was winter melon soup with pork and seafood (has to be ordered in advance). It was very nice to look at and everyone immediately took out their phones to take photos. Before we finished our soup, the other dishes came out one by one until our table was so filled with food that we ran out of space. The dishes we had were whole boneless (!) chicken filled with sticky rice (ordered in advance), chili pork chops, eggplant, seafood taro basket, beef in some sauce with onions, green beans with pork and finally lobster. All the dishes were amazing, very flavorful but not spicy. Even though i enjoyed all of the above dishes, I'm highly recommending the eggplant, stuffed boneless chicken, pork chops and the beef. They are sooooo delicious! 
To top this off they serve a red bean soup for dessert,  on the house. I tried it and did not like it. It literally tastes like water with sugar and pieces of red beans in it. That's it. 
Based on this visit and previous ones, I rate this restaurant a 5* out of 5. Just make sure you preorder the boneless chicken and winter melon soup to avoid disappointment.",2016-10-29 15:02:07

After taking one bite of those I was thoroughly excited for the rest of my meal but sadly everything else was just ok.. we had the stuffed mushrooms, creamy spinach and gorganzola stuffed inside a mushroom topped with a cream sauce sounded good on paper but was not very well executed. The grilled chicken breast was a bit dry with not a lot of flavor, and the penne pasta was a little over cooked and mushy, and please don't get me started on the vegetable of the day, butternut squash, just gross, under cooked, under seasoned, and unimpressive. 
The crab legs, one of their daily specials were well prepared and tasty, no wow factor in them but delicious none the less, and the peppercorn steak soup and garden salad were both filling and yummy but still again nothing to call home to my mother about. 
As for the ambiance, it was pleasant, we sat out on the patio and although the traffic of Scottsdale road was a little distracting I still enjoy my time there, the music however was a little odd for a steakhouse, 80's hairband rock and weird techno beats, interesting if nothing else.

I remember hearing about this place opening and the usual long lines and hype around it. The pictures looked good, and I was definitely intrigued by the concept as the udon I usually have is the simple noodles and clear broth. Came here for dinner with my girlfriend and the place was pretty empty for a Thursday. The interior is simple and clean with a bar facing the semi open kitchen and tables everywhere else. 

Service: Simple, friendly service. Nothing terrible but nothing memorable either. It's a local spot and they serve noodles. It is what it is. 

Starters: Takoyaki. Probably the best takoyaki that I've had in Vegas, came out sizzling hot on a skillet garnished with onion flakes. Looks trippy as the flakes move due to the heat making it seem like the dish is alive. Just from first impressions I could tell that this was going to be top notch and i was right. The takoyaki is very hot but the perfect amount of crispiness, sauce, and of course octopus. Generous with the portions too compared to other places but if I could I would have ordered 3 plates. 

Entrees: Sea Urchin Cream Udon x Seafood Tomato Cream Udon. Both were great and it felt like I was eating pasta sometimes instead of udon. I love the creaminess of the broths as well as the generous amounts of uni in mine and also seafood in my girlfriends. The noodles are thick just like udon should be, but also just the right amount of tender. It's handmade in house and nothing beats hand made noodles whether it's pasta, ramen, or anything else. I found myself done with my noodles pretty fast and wishing for noodle refills which I'm not sure if they had. Luckily my girlfriend couldn't finish and gave me some of hers. I still wasn't satisfied and found myself drinking the broth as well. Be wary if you're someone who likes extra noodles alot, but the quality and portions are there. 

Thoughts: I've never tried the one in LA so I can't compare but I can definitely say that I'm a fan and it's refreshing to see something different from Ramen as there's so many around town these days. I love the lightly Italian inspired yet traditional dishes and the takoyaki itself is worth a visit.

The very next day, a Saturday, we decided to meet here at noon. I sort of panicked when I arrived because there were so many people obviously waiting to be seated.  I went in to find the host, but before I could get very far in, he found ME and asked how many.  Turns out he is the owner.  I put my name down, and 30 minutes later we had a seat outside.

The outside is basically a tented area on the sidewalk right out front of the restaurant. The heat wasn't too bad until it got later in the afternoon, I started to feel it (or maybe it was the mimosas??).  The inside is very small and packed. You have to order at the counter and then take a number to your table where they will bring you your food and drinks (if you ordered any).  If you want water though, you have to go get it yourself.  

It's a bit of a hassle ordering and getting water. There is a lot of jostling, and squeezing past people and tables and servers and bussers to order your food or to get water.  I wish they would at least serve you water at the table so you didn't have to get up in the middle of your meal to refill your tiny plastic water cup. Also, after we ordered and sat down, it took about 30 minutes for them to bring our food. 

However, the food is so amazing that I'm willing to forgive all of that. I ordered the Sonora crepe, which is carne asada, guacamole, fire roasted salsa and cheese. Everything about this crepe was perfection. The flavors worked so incredibly well together. I could not stop eating even after I was stuffed.  I can't wait to go back and eat it again!

Nope. Still burnt. Still totally frustrated that even having to wait 10 min in their store that they would actually do them right. When I expressed my disappointment in the outcome, I immediately got attitude about it. Another 15 min they wanted to re make the knots. Forget it, I'll just give them to a homeless person.

I got the chicken bento box, which came with chicken and broccoli in a delicious, homemade brown sauce, two fried shrimp, two crab rangoons, brown rice, and a salad. I also appreciated that they offered me a fork! He got a special roll - the Bamboo  - along with a few pieces of Nigiri. There weren't as many pieces in the Bamboo roll as he hoped, but that was the only bad thing about it. 

Service was outstanding, and since they were even more packed than usual and running a little behind, they brought us complimentary edamame.

The restaurant's space itself is beautiful.  It has a turn-of-the-century Paris vibe that really sets the mood for the food.  Our waiter was helpful and polite in an unobtrusive way that seemed peculiarly French.  Mind you, I've never been to France, so that's a statement of instinct.

Let me not forget the food, for it was delicious.  I ordered the Benedict Monte, with two beautifully poached, wispy eggs, ham, tomato, asparagus, potatoes, and Hollandaise sauce, served with a croissant.  It was fabulous.

The chardonnay was incredible subtle hints of fruit and a creamy finish. 

Then came the food... They brought out the seared tuna appetizer... did not order that... asked one of the bartenders what this was... it was not the salad so he took it back... then the original bartender came over to apologize.. fine whatever, but could you please ask the kitchen to put the herb dressing and ginger dressing on the side. He said sure and walked back to the kitchen...

Almost everyone whom I've spoken to has raved about the food at this Summerlin restaurant. Now, I can finally add my say to its long list of accolades. 

Appetizer - Elizabeth's Caesar Salad: A basic but pleasant starter to dinner. The salad was lightly dressed with black garlic dressing and parmesan cheese, and garnished with a puffy chickpea chip, which my friends and I wished were sold in bags at the restaurant. 

Main Course - Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken Breast: Moist and tender, the chicken breast laid upon a bed of mac and cheese with kale and Anaheim peppers. The downside of this course was the saltiness of the mac a cheese. I tasted random patches saltiness in mine; whereas, my friend's was consistent. Another friend ordered the Caramelized Sea Scallops that was buttery, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I hate to say it, but I should've ordered that instead. Though, don't get me wrong, the chicken and mac were good. 

Dessert - Brown Bag Baked Apple Pie: This one of Honey Salt's signature desserts. It's absolutely delightful tasting, and it pairs well with the scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. 

Service - Not bad. Our waiter was on top of it even as business picked up --  I would suggest making reservations no matter what  time of day you decide on visiting. 

Overall - This is my new Summerlin dining spot. With a variety of appetizing menu options, as well as a Sunday brunch feature, how could I not come back?",2014-03-16 19:57:48

This is probably one of the only places left where you can still buy CDs and have a great selection. Now they don't have every single album by every single artist but who does. That is probably a good thing because then I would end up buying half the store. So you might have to go back a few times to find what you are looking for. No big deal. It is nice to roam around the stacks.
They have every kind of music there is. So even you weirdos who listen to things no one has ever heard of or shouldn't hear ever they have it. The prices aren't too bad either. You could probably go on-line and save some money but by the time you pay shipping and wait around you probably didn't really save that much.

However, the food is mediocre at best. I ordered a curry rice meal and while they try to be cute and put as many things in the bowl as possible, there were a few pieces of fresh fruit in there. A very weird combination of tastes and I'd rather they just served fruit separately. In the end I left the fruit there and it's just a waste. 

Moreover, since it's technically a tea cafe, i'd expect their tea to be above average.  Ordered a green tea matcha as part of the meal and it was the most watery matcha I've ever tasted.

Told training director, Joe Ramos, that for the high training cost and my goals, I hoped for someone (preferably female) friendly and approachable who would encourage me on my weightloss journey. Instead, I was placed with a new, stereotypical meathead trainer who was very unfriendly and clearly wanted to be anywhere but our sessions(lose track of count(and would ask me the count), would look at watch frequently to see when our time was up , look anywhere but me and never spoke to me as a human being). When he couldn't make it to a session, I scheduled with Dillion, whom I really liked and learned a lot from but he abruptly quit. Even with my complaints about the previous trainer not being a good fit, Joe wanted to place me back with the same trainer. 

For a month, there was no one taking over my sessions. I asked if I was able to reduce the number of sessions I was paying for from 3 to 2 without penalty. Joe sat down with me and said they could do that with no problem and no penalty. He typed on the computer and said it was taken care of and I would hear from headquarters. I did not. 

After hubby's schedule changed and we could no longer afford the sessions due to increased daycare needs, I asked Joe about cancellation options. He said that I could not cancel, penalty-free until 32 weeks, so we decided together to do a reduction of sessions down to 1 until the 32 week mark. 

I received my bill the next month and was still being charged nearly $200 for all of the original sessions. When I called to inquire, I was told that we are not allowed to reduce sessions without penalty. They looked in the notes and Joe had written that he told me I ""could not reduce at this time and I understood."" Ummmm...no, you immoral d-bag. I was livid. No responses from Joe via phone, email or text, like a date gone wrong. Lol! Typically even-keeled, I went in in person the next day and said that I would be going directly to headquarters to report the unethical behavior and it will either be corrected now or through higher ups. Magically, when I get home, I had a message from Joe, stating that the cancelation had actually been approved that very same morning!!! Sunshine and rainbows. (I am not an idiot, as he told me cancelation wasn't even an option). I then asked to cancel my entire membership and was told it was taken care of. Guess who was charged again the following month? 

I did love the Wed. night Zumba class and the machines got the job done. The layout is awkward and group fitness room has windows where everyone working out looks right in at you. Dudes would often stop at the windows when we were shaking booties. Childcare is an additional cost and there is no way for people to clean equipment after use. 

Don't fall for phony Joe. He clearly only cares about the bottom line with trainers. If you MUST have a pool and group fitness, a typical membership would be worth it but if you only use machines, join YouFit or Planet Fitness where membership is much cheaper and equipment is newer and nicer.",2015-04-30 07:17:59

The service was a bit lacking because we couldn't find a server when we wanted to get our tea refilled. They do clear off our table quite quickly which was very necessary because we ordered a lot of food for four people.

We also picked Cracker Barrel because it is on the north side of Glendale Ave and it would be easier and quicker to navigate back to the Brown parking lot on 91st.

The spacious aisles and clean, organized displays are a nice change from the usually crammed downtown grocery shopping experience (e.g. the metro in the basement of College Park). Everything is easy to find and makes sense. The selection from produce, to meat/seafood, to prepared foods is excellent and not more expensive than other Loblaws locations. I have gone during busy hours, and even then there is never a lineup more than one or two people at the cashier. This location is very well-staffed compared to other Loblaws. 

Most recently, I tried the Patisserie. Cupcakes are $1.99 each, but if you buy a dozen, it costs $20.99. I find the pricing quite reasonable compared to other cupcake shops like Dufflet, Prairie Girl, Petite Thuet, etc. There are some fancier and larger cupcakes that cost a bit more. But for the $1.99 ones, flavours include: red velvet, chocolate, vanilla, sour cherry, caramel, bubble gum, chocolate peanut butter, cookies and cream, mint chocolate, orange cream, and lemon. I tried the bubble gum flavour. The cake part was a nice, fluffy texture. The icing is also surprisingly light and whipped -- very fresh and not hard on top. The bubble gum flavour is a bit weird to be honest, but people seemed to really like all the other flavours.

I made a reservation for 5:30pm, totally forgot about the insanity of downtown traffic on a weekday and got there are 5:50.  The host was gracious and accommodating to this bump in the road.  The only odd thing was that as soon as I got there, the waiter asked me what I wanted to eat.  There were several empty tables around me that didn't get filled until our dining experience was over (around 7:30) so I didn't understand what the rush was.  Other than that oddity, our waiter was very pleasant.

I ordered the potato leek soup and the scallops entree.  My dining partner ordered the Monkfish ""Osso Bucco"".  I was very much impressed with the potato leek soup.  The soup was accompanied by cheesy tater tots, confit bacon and a cute thinly sliced piece of toast.  The plate came out only with the accompaniments on them as the servers beautifully poured the soup around it.  Fancy, huh?  And so delicious.  The confit bacon is really incredible.  If I had done some better thinking I would have ordered two soups and called it a night.

I ordered the scallops dished based on many reviews here that I've read on Yelp.  It definitely did not disappoint.  I was torn between this and the monkfish, but this was surely the more heartier dish.  The scallops, risotto, and asparagus were executed well but in general this dish did not wow me.  That's not to say that it wasn't delicious but for me a dish like this looses points for originality.  The flavors were pretty standard.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and it's my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. Sorry, Rushton! I had made reservations at Mark McEwan's new restaurant, Fabbrica, but on the morning of the birthday became troubled by the deeply mixed reviews. I switched to Nota Bene at the last minute, and am so glad I did. They have everything all figured out.

I had made a reservation, which we were late for. I called to put it back and the hostesses were lovely about it and would accept no apologies when we arrived. The space is stunning. And huge. I was shocked at how much clean, contemporary, perfectly lit space was hiding behind that tiny little Queen and John facade. It's a beautiful place to have a long, quiet meal.

They have free corkage after 9, which we took advantage of. They took the bottle away from us while we had our cocktails, and brought it back at just the right moment. It had been decanted and allowed to air out just the right amount. I was nervous to bring it in and expected, perhaps, a bit of attitude about it or an up-sell on other things to make up for it - it didn't happen.

We were initially seated beside a group of four, with two drunk women that were simply screaming laughter. It was absolutely impossible to have any sort of conversation. We asked our server to re-seat us, stressing he had already begun to provide us with lovely service and did not want him to lose the table. He wasn't willing to be worried about that, but did remain our server in the end. The staff seemed to sense we were trying to have a quiet, intimate meal and ended up seating us in a completely empty area of the restaurant which we both recognized as a closed section. This was incredibly kind.

We saw lots of large groups having long, enjoyable, boozy meals. Everyone looked happy.

Salted cod appetizer was stunning to my palette. I could have eaten 3 servings. Just stunning. I had the Cavatelli with truffle oil and mushrooms, my boyfriend had the hangar steak - not one of the ""expensive ones."" Both were amazing - if this is the ""cheap steak,"" well... I don't know what to say. We had some sticky-toffee pudding for dessert, which was to die for, and they brought our a large piece of dark chocolate with ""Happy Birthday"" piped in white. Nice touch.

After many years working as a process engineer, I think that JM's could use a little of my help.  Looking at the change in reviews over the last couple of years, I can't figure out why they don't fix the problems that keep reoccurring in the local stores. 
This last visit is a good example of a major fault in their ""system"".  First of all, as a general comment, don't use the on-line ordering.  They screw this up all the time and you won't know until you get home that they missed something or your sandwiches have been sitting around for a couple of hours because they missed the time delay.

OK, this trip, simple order:  1 Regular Chicken Cheesesteak on Wheat with Provolone cheese and 1 giant Beef Cheesesteak on white with provolone and extra meat.  By the way, extra meat here is not like Subway's double meat, this is a half (or less) portion of the regular serving.

Error 1:  Verbal order, I'm ordering more than one sandwich, so when the girl wants to take the order without writing it down, I dropped one of the sandwiches off the list.  So they lost one giant sandwich there.  Ideally, they should have electronic POS system.  BK's is good, you see what you are ordering on the screen in front of you.  This also documents the order for everyone to use during the preparation.  

Error 2:  My order was handed off not once, but twice during my visit.  Here's what happened:  Girl takes order verbally and relays it to Guy 1 at the grille, he starts the sandwiches and walks away to get something else.  Guy 2 takes over the order on the grill and gets AMERICAN CHEESE ready to put on the sandwich.  From past experience, I know to watch what hits the grill and point out the miss to Guy 2.  He then proceeds to put the AMERICAN CHEESE on both sandwiches.  Guy 1 and the Girl remind him again that I wanted Provolone.  Guy 2 had already finished and wrapped the Chicken Cheesesteak, so he unpacked it, PUT IT BACK ON THE GRILL, and added the provolone, rewrapped it and dropped it in a bag.  The other Cheesesteak got the double cheese too, but before it was wrapped.  

OK, how to fix. . . ONE person takes the order and this must go into the electronic POS system.  NO hand offs, any one working in process development will tell you the failures and lost time occurs in handoffs to another task or person.   

Other issues:  The flattop in these stores is half the size it should be.  Busy stores get behind on the grille work and create delays.  The line runs backwards, the slicer outputs on the left and the line works to the right, this forces the sandwich maker to move around the slicer to put the meats/cheese onto the sandwich.  

Every time I go to JM's in the future, I'll add another segment to this story.  Watch my reviews and follow along. . .BobR",2017-05-27 00:19:52

I ordered the chicken kabob plate which is my usual fare in restaurants with this type of food. I have to say I wasn't particularly impressed. The quality of ingredients was decent but the chicken was fairly flavorless and the sauce they provided was tzatziki sauce which I don't care for but there were no other options such as garlic sauce found at other restaurants. My lunch wasn't cheap either; it came to around $13-14 which wasn't a good value based on the quality or the amount of food I received.

So first, don't expect fancy decor because I don't think they've redecorated since they opened the restaurant 30 years ago. This is a really traditional, family-style restaurant with no bells and whistles. The focus is on the FOOD. If you get there past 5pm on a weekend, you can expect a line-up.  That said, you can call ahead to order takeout.

In my opinion, Elio makes the best pizza in town. They're not cheap on the toppings, and I find their all-dressed to be a well-rounded mix of pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms and cheese. The crust is perfect - not too thick. I also appreciate that their crust is never wet like some places!  Their pasta dishes are equally good, with my favorite being the cavatelli. I'm not sure if they make their own pasta but if not, the guy they get it from does a real good job of giving me that illusion!  Elio's sauce is so good that I never leave the resto without buying a jar or two. Yup, Elio stocks the front fridge with sauce and a few pastas for those of us who want to bring some home. 

Elio offers a few different pastas and sauces that you can 'mix and match' if you like. They are very generous with their portions, so you'll leave there with a Buddha belly and quite possibly, a doggy bag. As well, their prices are super affordable.

Was downtown for a concert at Dodge Theater, and we wanted to grab a bite before the show. Walked past Z-Pizza (now closed, sadly), Harumi and the Thai place next door. Thai looked a little stuffy, Z-Pizza is kaput, so we figure sushi it is...

Place is super busy, but we get a nice booth in the back. Good banter with the older Asian gal that sat us. Dig it. We see some of the rolls on other people's plates, and they look sensational. 

They have Koshihikari Echigo and big bottles of Asahi at a reasonable price. Two of my favorites. Fuck yeah. 

Order the Poke Stack, a few rolls, some nigiri and Jalapeno Rolls. All are outstanding, some of the best fish I've had outside of super-locals-only-spots in Hawaii where I couldn't go without my Japanese lady friend. Absolutely love their rice, color and texture is perfect. The Jalapeno Roll was something I've never seen, but was executed perfectly. How they get the pepper cooked perfectly with perfect tempura on the outside is beyond me. Hats off!

Great conversation with the couple seated across from us after they ordered some sort of amazing roll served in a flaming foil fan. Very cool, and good vibes in this restaurant.

Service was fast, friendly and efficient. Food comes out quick given how busy they were. All the chefs are sure to wave ""bye"" when you leave, too.

No joke.

Prior to dining at Taco Tanto's proper, I've been luck enough to enjoy their delicious guacamole next door at Zephyr.  I was blown away by their guac, which is incredibly fresh and flavorful; some of the best I've had.  yet for some crazy reason, I never ventured into the restaurant or tried their other foods.  How silly of me.  I could have been enjoying delicious sweet potato burritos for months!  I don't know how they make it (I think it might be magic) but somehow the sweet potato and black beans combine to create heaven.  I'm not exaggerating.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is pretty tiny.  Yet during lunchtime on a Monday, it was also empty, so we had no concerns about snagging a table.  You order your food at the counter, and then they call your name when it's ready so you can pick it up.  Chances are your wait will be less than 5 minutes.

I am so glad I did. The restaurant was clean and well-staffed, and our waiter, although not real friendly or anything, was polite and efficient. I ordered a Yuengling which came in a huge .5L glass (a surprise to me) and was perfectly cold and fresh.

I ordered my sandwich with spicy Italian sausage. What came out of the kitchen was a thing of beauty. Two slices of soft, fresh Italian bread, with layers of sausage, fries, cole slaw, tomato and raw onion. It was absolutely delicious! It was filling without being really heavy--the fries are not real greasy and the cole slaw is vinegar-based, not doused in mayo.

The flavors of everything in the sandwich work perfectly together, and my pronouncement upon finishing the first half was that this was easily one of the best sandwiches I had ever eaten.

What I also find impressive is that Primanti's is such an institution, they could put out far inferior food and still coast on their reputation, but far from just being some gimmick, the sandwich is actually really tasty.

When we arrived, the restaurant was moderately busy, but there were a number of open tables.  Of course, we were led to the tiniest table that was placed so close between two others that I felt like we should offer to share food with our neighbors.  We asked to sit at an open booth, and were told no; they ""thought it might be reserved"".  We ended up deciding to sit at the bar, and no one used the booth the entire time.  

I was very excited about trying the bacon board, and it was darn tasty.  I absolutely loved the onion and tomato jams, and the lightly-cheesed toast was the perfect addition to the meats.  It was curious that the board was given to us without any explanation though.  I would have expected to have been told about the 5 different types of bacon and accompaniments.  We asked for some guidance so we knew what we were eating, but the server wasn't even sure the difference between a couple of them.  Still, it was tasty.  We also shared the BBQ Turkey breast.  I love that it came with homemade tortillas; it made delicious little tacos with the coleslaw on top.  We finished our meal by sharing the peach/blueberry cobbler.  Yum! 

Other than the seating issues, my main complaint was the chatter among the wait/host staff.  Since we were sitting at the bar, close to the kitchen entrance and hostess station, we were privy to a number of personal conversations that shouldn't have been taking place, including complaints about a customer across the room.

I came in with no kids and wanted a burger and a beer. When you walk in you immediately notice the open space and loud music. There are kids running around everywhere. They have some video games and a bowling alley. The game area is not too extensive so don't come here thinking you are going to play video games all night, you will quickly run out of options. They do have 6 pool tables and a skeeball machine if you are into that.  They have some bowling lanes towards the back with videos playing on large screens. 

I headed to the bar where I asked for a kilt lifter and a menu. The music was so loud the bartender couldn't hear me so I repeated my ask. She then said something but I couldn't hear her so we went back and forth like that yelling at each other to put my beer order in. 

I get a menu and immediately notice this really is all bar food. They had a few hamburgers you could pick from. Some over priced appetizers and a bunch of pizza options. I paid around $20 for a beer and a hamburger. I got the food and it was average at best. Frozen thin patty and fries. 

My Opinion: 
If you have kids and want to bowl, this is probably the place. If you don't have kids and are just looking for some beer and food, I would say go somewhere else unless you find the bartender attractive and want to sit here and stare at her (she is pretty cute) since you won't be able to hold a conversation over the music. 

Overall I would say the ""other"" entertainment place is much better for kids and adults. So if you want to bowl, this is your place. For anything else, keep driving a few more miles and you will probably have a better experience.",2016-05-21 20:07:49

The menu has two main options, chicken combinations and chicken sandwiches. Then there are sides, shakes, beer, wine, and sodas. We were all in the mood for chicken sandwiches and immediately narrowed in on that section of the menu. Oddly missing from the sandwich options was anything with a Buffalo breading. They do offer a variety of sauces to create your own spicy sandwich though.

I had the Cheesy Supreme Chicken Sandwich and a side of Corn & Bacon. The sandwich was very tasty. I really liked the flavor of the seasoning used in the breading on the chicken. The flavors all seemed fresh. The BR special sauce has a nice flavor that went well with the chicken. The sandwich held together nicely so I was able to enjoy it without a mess. The Corn & Bacon was as described, nothing special. I tried my husband's mashed potatoes and didn't enjoy this at all as they didn't seem freshly made to me. I also snagged French Fries from my brother and found these to be quite delicious. Each table had a variety of sauces that could be used to customize the flavor of your chicken.

The line to order took a minute and it took longer than expected for our food to arrive. I did like that food is delivered to the table instead of making people wait by the counter for food. The dining room was clean and employees were constantly coming around to help clear trash. It also seems like the restaurant cares about the environment and invests in compostable packaging for food and drink.",2016-11-14 03:11:02

My two favourite flavours here are the garlic garlic dry rub and the gar par. The wings also come with a side of fries and veggie sticks (depending on the location ) which is a nice bonus. 

Today we ordered the jalapeno poppers and 1 lb of the garlic garlic and gar par in the boneless wings as that was the Monday special. 

There were only 5 jalapeno poppers in a serving and it tasted kind of lacklustre, like it gave up trying to be an app. In my first bite, there was some unevenness going on, half of the jalapeno wasn't fully cooked and tasted cold still, while the other was burning hot.

The boneless wings tended to be more on the dry side when compared to their regular wings - probably because they are all white meat. 

But..I probably will come back just for the 2 seasoning flavors, as I haven't found anything that quite simulates them anywhere else yet. Having said that, stick to the wings (with bones) my friends.",2017-12-06 15:58:26
KzDGTiGFxPRQGTIG9fVDvQ,iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw,4,3,0,2,"Third stop on an Aria/Crystals foodie crawl.  We sat down at the bar eager for some tapas and sangria.  I got a glass of red sangria ($4.50 - bargain!), which is my favorite sangria in all of Las Vegas.  Perfect spice to it.  Doesn't just taste like watered down red wine.  My husband got a glass of white wine, the Albarino ($9) which was good but a little sweet for my tastes.  I like dry white wine.

We went a little nuts and got three tapas!  I was really intrigued by the salmon truffle ($12) which is a piece of salmon with bechamel truffle sauce atop a portabello mushroom.  This was actually disappointingly ok.  Maybe I was all truffled out from the truffle fritters at Jean Georges but this dish just didn't do much for me.

We also got the oysters ($10) which the server said could be served with a mango foam or traditional.  This was confusing because the menu said gazpacho foam.  We went for the mango foam, but when we got them, it was definitely gazpacho foam.  Either way, they were very good and fresh.  The oysters come in servings of 4.

Finally we got the pata negra ($35), which we always get here.  Now it is ham, some bread, and a tomato sauce, which may be a little offputting given the price.  But this is famous blackhoofed pig and only comes from Spain.  The ham is cured for 3 years and it is just so yummy.  The tomato sauce, which appears to be fresh tomatoes and olive oil, goes perfectly with the ham.

A good experience but I was disappointed by the salmon so I'll drop off a star.  Plus, they got slammed towards the end of our meal (our server actually exclaimed out loud about being slammed, so it must have been bad) and it took a while to get the check.  No biggie.  Nice atmosphere and it's open to the casino so great people watching.

Check out the bathrooms for sure here.  They are left of the bar towards the back.  Ladies to the left, mens to the right.  They pipe in some Spanish language tapes which are pretty hilarious.  Great restaurant!",2010-12-07 21:45:23
AA_1nnZ7W1vapmFlMForeA,2u5zHDck7j4V1dpw1lUnuQ,tCkjFVOL2Crz44D8_FDozg,2,1,0,0,"Well it's been several years since we have eaten at this restaurant. Not since the rigatoni's people owned it. We used to enjoy this place quite a bit as the food was good, patio ambiance was nice, and the service is usually spot on.

Only one Sunday afternoon tried again with the new ownership and left a bit disappointed. As mentioned above, the Trinity of restaurant experience of ambiance, food and service are necessary for good experience; however, if one is missing, and drastically missing here, experience is just marred.

We took a seat on the patio and were not greeted for 15 min. yes 15 full minutes sitting alone like hobo Joes. I kind of felt like leaving and going next door to dos gringos. The server finally approached was far from enthusiastic seemed like almost annoyance to her to be waiting tables this afternoon. Almost zombielike, probably just hung over. In fact all the service staff that I viewed seem to have this zombielike hangover.

Anyhow, I asked her about the bloody Mary's and they were good as I assume they should be a roadhouse and she said, ""the other awesome this bartender makes a really good."" I smiled and happily agreed and waited in anticipation for this bloody Mary of greatness. She left and we see her again for almost 15 min. which is absurd. When she did come back to the table she didn't have my drink she just wanted to take the food order simply said, ""you ready?"" Not much the menu lead huh. She took our food order and didn't offer an appetizer before leaving so I had to call her back to order one. Still no bloody Mary.

When the bloody Mary did arrive we have been seated for about 27 min. yes 27 min. to get a drink. What's more disappointing is how awful the drink was. I'm not particularly picky as I felt you can't really mess up a bloody Mary but they sure did. Came out in a small plastic tumbler glass and literally tasted like tomato juice with barely any spice in it and no garnish whatsoever. It looked really sad and tasted sad. What really pissed me off was about 15 feet away there was a couple of guys seating at the bar who have bloody Mary's in glass pint glasses with a salted rim and a bunch of garnishes with some celery stalk and you can see from the color of the drink that it was made like a bloody Mary. REALLY!! It really sucks and I totally felt cheated. Restaurants without consistency drive me crazy. A Big Mac in Boston is the same as a Big Mac in San Diego. Your drinks and food should be the same. 

The food runner or cook came to our table with an appetizer of sliders and said, ""your sliders."" I told him that we an order that that we ordered shrimp and he said, ""what you mean?"" I found that almost comical statement as it reiterated to him that we had ordered shrimp not sliders. About 5 min. later shrimp came out. This is where I have a hard time deciphering between two and three stars for this place because the food is really good. The Cajun shrimp drunken appetizer was outstanding. I even thought of ordering one to go for later on.

I had a Rubin and my mom had meatloaf. My mom's diabetic and can have a lot of sugar and the meatloaf came out with huge blobs of barbecue sauce on it. I'm not sure that was my mistake and I didn't read the menu correctly but I don't think I would have missed that. Anyhow we scraped off the barbecue sauce and my mom absolutely love smoky flavored meatloaf she commented about three times how good it was. My Reuben sandwich also was very good with an ample stacking of meat which I appreciated. Coleslaw was obviously fresh and had a good flavor but lacked the will of the seasoning and punch. Again food was outstanding. No doubt about that.

After the appetizer was served I had seen that they have Corona light on tap so I ordered one. 20 min. to get a beer and I was nearly finished with my meal when it came. This is stupid.

The only other negative was that the facility needs a bit of a facelift noticed was the same furniture from four or five years ago and it's starting to show.

Bottom line I probably won't go back because I can't deal with atrocious service.",2013-04-16 17:51:03

The beef carpaccio had lots going on but it worked perfectly. The ponzu sauce and garlic chips definitely enhanced this dish.

On the other hand, the duck confit spring rolls were very disappointing. The cheese and the duck did not go too well together. It did however did taste like I was eating a Peking duck with the sauce and the crunch of the spring roll. 

The tofu salad was not great as well. The tofu is a firm tofu and was too heavy. The tofu itself was too big and lacked flavours.

It was a lovely hotel with a great casino, and I hope to return sometime under better circumstances.

We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and this was the only annoying part of the hotel experience. The line was long as fuck, like at least second-tier Disneyland ride long. Aria must have a population size larger than many towns that voted Trump. Service was great. We were checked in by a nice young woman who'd just gotten her citizenship, who was still an undecided voter (she asked why we were in town, and we told her, but without saying which way we leaned). I hope she didn't vote for her own deportation.

The hotel was pretty in the Vegas way, every decor element over the top but somehow tasteful because of the ridiculous size of the hotel. Like insane light fixtures and velvet and leather walls (I touched all of those walls). The room was comfortable and nicely appointed, with a beautiful view. Beds were plush, and the bathroom clean with a good shower. I also enjoyed the control panel that let us open curtains and turn on lights. Mildly confusing, but very cool in an ""open sesame"" kind of way.

We spent a good amount of time in the casino, playing black jack and poker and pai gow (though let us not speak of the pai gow). We also ate at the pizza place and I think there was some kind of horrible election night party in the Aria, too, but honestly I was sad and a little sauced so I don't remember that in great detail (though there might have been a buffet that was only snack nuts). The parking situation was good, an easy garage with in and out privileges.

I'd recommend the Aria if you're looking for a hotel with a lot of modern luxury and only medium levels of Vegas cheese. The price point wasn't terrible (I won at the tables and covered my expenses easily), and I might come back for a real getaway one of these weekends.",2017-01-17 18:44:34

Your experience here will wow you in every aspect from the food to the drinks and the service, its an all around amazing experience.  When you come make sure to have room for all three courses. While I agree with everyone yes the bang bang shrimp is a staple if not THE staple for Bonefish Grill please kindly open your options to some of the other amazing items on the menu because if you haven't branched out you're doing yourself a disservice.  For starters the tuna sashimi appetizer is THE BEST one I have ever had in charlotte and believe me if I go out to eat and its offered I'm eating it no exceptions.  Its always perfectly seared and served with wasabi ginger soy sriracha and a perfect white sashimi sauce. Also if youre a fan of mussels this is always a win here also. 

Now on to the main course, they have an amazing selection of fish which is not limited to your average tilapia, salmon and trout. While they have these on the menu and they are some of the best sellers as they are delicious of course don't be afraid to go above and beyond with something like the seabass or the even branch out from the seafood category and try the fontina porkchop. Its to die for. This place perfected seafood but they also have landfood down pat too, from the fontina chop to the lilys chicken.  They also have specialty toppings that will take your entrée to the next level like you wouldn't believe, now these aren't always on the menu so be sure to ask for them. For example try the Imperial style topping that usually comes on the tilapia on the seabass. Basically its a seabass stuffed with shrimp scallops crabmeat gruyere and parmesean cheese then topped with a lemon butter caper sauce.... uh yes please!!  OR if your wanting something lighter try any fish Rheas style, its best on seabass and salmon but honestly compliments fish or steak perfectly its sautéed spinach lump crab meat and a lime tomato garlic sauce.  These are only examples of SOME of the toppings they have,,,,, can you tell I eat here too much? Just ask they have so many options to customize your order and make a delicious meal, that much more outstanding.

Also don't forget to pair your meal with the perfect glass (or bottle) of wine or cocktail they have one of the best wine menus I have seen in a chain restaurant and its ever changing with so many options to choose from.  Also save room for dessert as they have THE BEST coconut pie you have ever tasted served with freshly made whip cream and rum sauce.  They also always have a seasonal dessert, my favs being the chocolate crème brulee and/or the pumpkin crème brulee they have in the fall and winter.

Service is always amazing from the servers and bartenders to the management. Every experience you have here is always special in some way even beyond the food. I can definitely see why there are so many regulars myself included.",2016-04-13 04:02:54

Here is the back story: Several years ago we dropped in for a few slices during St. Patrick's day activities. At the time (and under the influence of green beer) we thought the pizza was amazing. So good we couldn't stop talking about it. The next day we picked up a whole pie and it was hot garbage pizza. I don't remember the details but we thought it was awful & we distrusted our drunken memory of the delicious pizza we thought we had enjoyed the day before. We vowed to never eat Nunzio's again. It became a punchline in our household--beware of Nunzio's, the pizza you should only eat intoxicated! 

Flash forward to this week, we walked home from a local establishment (not intoxicated but hungry) and decided to give the place another chance. Nunzio's is a Cleveland-area staple and it's really close to where we live too. So we picked up a few single slices which come with a can of pop per slice. Not a bad deal! They produced the slices in a timely manner and we're pretty friendly. (Note: The weird thing is they didn't tell us until after our order was complete that the ""credit card machine was down"" and they needed us to pay in cash. Fortunately we were able to do that.) When we got home we were pleasantly surprised! Nunzio's was good pizza again! How could this be?

Because we are new home owners we have received several ""welcome to the neighborhood"" complimentary pizzas and other coupons to local establishments. One of those happened to be Nunzio's & as stated previously, we were too cautious to enjoy even a free pizza. But after trying a few slices the week before we decided to give it a go. 

We ordered a large pepperoni and cheese pizza. We were given an estimate that the pizza would arrive in 45 minutes and it came in less time than that. The crust was good, crispy where it should be and not too ""bready"" like commercially prepared pizzas. Where I think Nunzio's shines is the pepperoni and cheese. The toppings were thick and likely to come off in one bite, leaving the slice naked but still yummy. I really enjoyed the ratio. 

The one thing you should be aware of.... this pizza is grease city! The slices were drenched in orange pepperoni grease and it was also on the box. They lined the box with was paper so the grease didn't seep through. Fortunately, the grease didn't upset my tummy or anything. 

I guess the last thing to know is that they deliver up to 3am. And that's really Nunzio's most unique quality. 

All in all, I'm glad I gave Nunzio's a second chance. I would like to give them more stars based on my most recent experiences... but my past memories are still very strong and I'm not ready to let my guard down.",2018-06-10 11:14:03

When I first moved here 3 years ago I would regularly search for honey/brick toast options in the valley and would always end up exasperated and resigned to the fact that I'd have to satisfy that craving when I visited California.

Now 3 years later and honey toast is all over the place! TBH I came here two years ago to see if they had honey toast and they did not at the time which was a bummer but not anymore!

Anyway, for a Wednesday night this place had a steady stream of customers at 10:30 PM. I came along because I needed to kill time waiting for my husband. While I'm confident in doing things independently, you won't be self-conscious and alone because there are tons of people studying.. going on dates.. celebrating with their families. 

Service is good. They answered my questions and were patient when I couldn't decide what to order and if I wanted it for here or to go. Finally I settled on honey toast with chocolate sauce, strawberries, and vanilla ice cream along with a mango iced tea. Both were so good. SO GOOD. The mango tea was a little sweet and heavy on the syrup but that was fine. The ice dilutes it. The honey toast is definitely shareable. It took about 10 minutes to make so be patient.

They have a salsa bar with a diverse array of choices, and I do enjoy the all the exotic options.  Oh and the Horchata is decent.

Unfortunately, I believe they will not last too long.  It is always empty, and they are closing earlier every time I visit.  Maybe location is not the greatest, and the service is sluggish, but I really hope they stick around.",2014-04-25 05:57:48

Called ahead to get wait time as this would be my 2nd attempt to try the brunch cuisine Another Broken Egg had to offer..1st attempt we didn't get seated due same issue, being told one wait time and upon arrival, having to wait much later.
We were finally  seated  this 2nd go around after waiting 20 minutes when we were told 5 min wait on the phone. (We were in the parking lot)

Our 1st server (yes 1st server) took our drink order and after she served them, became ""too busy"" to take our order, so someone else obliged us.  Our food arrived luke warm. Did I mention that we were told several  times that the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes frequently? This is where I grew a disdain. We arrived at 1:10pm... waited to be seated for approximately 20 mins...after being told it was a 5 min wait.
Server situation took an additional 20-25 mins. Now the server  has mentioned at least 4x how the restaurant closes SOON.

I give every place a 5 starting out. As the visit progresses, whatever happens dictates my ratings. I allowed myself to get excited about a mediocre restaurant just by reading the menu online. NEVER DO THAT!

I will not recommend this establishment to anyone. My Bloody Mary was the silver lining. So disappointed!


TODAY:
Better service and no wait time is what the difference was. Other than that, the lobster brie omelette tastes more like imitation crab and brie. The brie was sliced thickly this visit which overwhelmed everything else.

We wanted to try as many different types of foods as possible and I believe some of the raw oysters and scallops were only available on the weekend menu.  Upon entering the restaurant, you will notice how grand and upscale the place looks and the amount of different types of dessert that they had.  They definitely had a lot of desserts to choice from and my understanding was that they even won an award for their dessert selection. For this place, I will go through the good, the bad and the ugly as I have done so in previous buffet experiences. 

The good and probably the best were the raw scallops.  The raw scallops were nice and cold and immersed in a tray full of ice as it came out of the kitchen. The raw oysters and scallops come out approximately every fifteen minutes.  The scallops were fresh, healthy looking and quite tasty.  As per restaurant rules, you could only get three at a time however it doesn't say that you can't go back afterwards and go get some more at a later time.  The scallops itself were certainly well worth the wait.  Make sure you give them a try.  It's where you will get some of your money's worth.  Also good was the prime rib that evening.  The meat was nice and pink that evening and I was given a beautiful center piece. I had about two of those pieces that evening.  They also had a variety of hams and other meats available for one to choose from.  Another nice feature they had was a running chocolate fondue station.  People can gather as many marshmallows and fruits from other stations and have them drenched in a running fountain of chocolate.  This was very yummy and had many people flocking to its station.  

In terms of the bad, the squid legs in my mind were not the greatest here at this restaurant.  They seemed stale and almost had a hard rubber texture to it.  I'm not really too sure whether I got some tentacles that had been sitting there for quite some time but the squid legs weren't really my cup of tea that evening.  It actually took some effort to chew it apart and the bland taste of it certainly did not help matters.  My gut feeling was that it had been sitting out there for quite some time and unfortunately I was the recipient of it.  The hardest part about buffets is that it is sometimes very difficult to determine how long some of the food has been sitting at their stations.  Most places won't even consider throwing it out because after all it is food.  Regardless of the situation, the squid legs were just average at best. 

The worse part of the evening had to have been the raw oysters.  These oysters I know were ""fresh"" from the back because a lady had wheeled out a whole tray of them out from the back.  There was a lineup forming and the lady made sure that you were only to get three raw oysters each time around.  The three I took back were all somewhat deflated. (They are not the ones depicted in the picture)  Personally I could tell that they probably had not been sitting in the ice tray too long as the oysters were a little warm when I had them.  Needless to say, my fears were soon realized as I tried one of their oysters.  The oyster was warm and actually tasted like damp cardboard.  It didn't taste good at all and I actually ended up spitting out the first oyster I had on my plate. The second one was slightly better and by then I didn't even bother consuming  the third.  The problem with the raw oysters was that if they had been opened and just left in a tray and not iced for a long period of time or if the box itself has been sitting out for a while, then the oysters could potential begin to dry.  Another problem with eating raw oysters in an all you can eat buffet restaurant is that sometimes you could get shortchanged by getting some of the cheaper oysters of the sea.  With the oysters on my plate, all that was left on them was just the skin from what I could tell.  Good oysters, even the cheapest ones, still have some ""stuff"" on the inside so that the oyster looks healthy and inflated. The ones I had were all dehydrated and deflated to say the least. 

Overall it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  The raw scallops and their dessert section were actually my favorite especially with the huge variety of desserts that one could choose from.  I know I ate my money's worth however as mentioned above, the quality of some their seafood could have been better prepared.  Despite the odds and ends, the place was super packed and I would highly recommend getting reservations prior to going.",2017-02-20 23:02:03

Well, my husband recently surprised me with a staycation in a corner King Spa room so now I can say that I got to experience the beauty and luxury that is Kimpton Hotel Monaco. 

Let's start with the design and decor. Give me anything quirky and funky that involves bold pattern mixing, and I will eat it up. From the emerald tufted headboards to the houndstooth bathroom, I loved it all. Hotel Monaco is making a statement that screams ""I'm luxurious without taking myself too seriously."" 

Speaking of serious, let's move on to the gigantic bathroom and the seriously large soaking tub that stood in the middle of an open concept shower room. That tub was the tub of my dreams. Deep enough to get a complete soak and large enough for two people (three if you're adventurous). All the bath products smelled delicious too, so that was a bonus.

The King bed was absolutely divine. Is was so comfortable that I could have spent an entire week between the sheets (Room service could have kept me sustained).

For that reason is why I can only give it a max 4 star. Don't get me wrong the food was awesome! I just don't feel like the price is worth it to come back and eat here all the time. Especially for fried chicken. 

We ordered a wedge salad and fried green tomato appetizer and I love love love the pork belly!!! It was so good in both dishes I would just come back for that!! I've actually never had fried green tomato before and I will say it was a memorable dish. The salad was also fire! 

So the chicken wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had for I feel the batter is lacking. The preparation was actually phenomenal!! You can always tell when they cook the breast perfectly it's not too dry! Was still very juicy and I enjoyed it. I will say the waffle was really good too. The syrup they served with it was MEH. But that's just me I prefer just regular maple syrup would have been better than the bourbon they used. But combine all of it with the hot sauce in one bite and the combination was a party in my mouth. So I recommend taking a piece of chicken and waffle add syrup and hot sauce all in 1 bite! Yummy!! 

If yardbird found a way to bring their prices down or even offer some type of local specials I would see myself being a regular but until then it's hard to say when I would want to eat here again but I definitely enjoyed it!",2016-03-09 07:52:14

It's not the server's fault but.. still.. this place sucks.

Ambience: in a word? Awkward. It was nearly empty on a Saturday night. Probably because it's stuck way in the back corner next to a chiropractor's office. The lighting is much like a doctor's office, overly bright in an artificial way. The music is canned muzac... again like a doctor's office. And the layout of the place is terrible. The sushi station is in the center with a small bar and the booths line the way facing the bar. So basically the booth people are staring at the back of your head if you're at the bar. There are a few random tables on either side of this strangeness. 

Service: Clueless. Was the guy who seated us our server? Or is the sushi guy our server? Who do we order drinks with? Who do we order hot food/sushi from? So confusing. They seemed just as confused as us because when we ordered from the sushi guy, he clearly was annoyed and said he'd ""Take care of it""... uh ok.. thanks? Then we ordered some hot food which... never came. Until I asked for it, which of course was too late. 

Food: Good enough, but not good enough for me to come back. 

I don't know how Sushi Ko stays in business considering how they're hiding in the corner of the Chompie's shopping center, especially with such poor service and atmosphere. Pretty much what I'm saying is, go to Hiro Sushi down the street and just endure the wait. They have a wait because they're good at what they do.",2012-07-19 16:08:26

Food City sells the 1 bushel bags (~25-30lbs) in mild/medhot/hot or already roasted outside in the parking lot.  No guessing, wondering what you're getting.  If you buy bushels such as I, let the cashier know so they will charge you appropriately (10cents more per lb) and the guy outside will roast for you w/ receipt.  Roasting at home is a long and tedious process when you're talking 30-60 lbs of chilies on a normal grill.  I personally like to mix a bag of mild and medium to freeze for an entire year of green chili goodness.

Don't forget to pickup the cojita cheese and crema as well, apparently Food City is award winning for their corn and flour tortillas which this location does make on site.  Sometimes I purchase some of their watery fresh fruit juices if it's avail as I walk in.

Worst case if the chilies are out, you can go across the street for already roasted and bagged (about double in price) but you don't know what spice level chili you're buying.. so ask if you can sample.",2010-09-03 15:48:56

Like chili and chocolate and all sorts of yumminiess rolled together. I had an Arabic burrito which was much more delicious than it sounds. They happily made it without onions for me and it was awesome. 
Oh, and order the horchata. Trust me. They make it in house and if horchata tasted like this all the time I'd drink it way more often.

We took the hunt into our own hands, but really couldn't find any napkins anywhere. We waited for about 5 more minutes then we grabbed him from outside.

The owner could tell we'd never been to his establishment, and was extremely engaged with us to help make the right choice for our particular tastes. My wife took no time at all to make her decision, thanks in part to the fantastic pictures they have displayed on the counter for each available dog. They also have ""display only"" portions of some of the available sides (french fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, and I BELIEVE it was fried okra).

She opted for the Gagou Dog, which is a hot dog topped with cheese and pepperoni, ultimately converting it into a pizza dog. Hers was DELICIOUS! The dog was cooked just right, the cheese was melted just right, and the pepperoni was an awesome touch. The whole novelty of the ""pizza dog"" is so simple, but really good!

I wish I had ordered the same thing she did. Unfortunately, I did not.

Maybe it's because I'm not native to AZ, but I don't see the appeal to the Sonoran Dog. I ordered it because I've been told that it's a must eat in Arizona. I mean, don't get me wrong...it was palatable. But, I was pretty underwhelmed by it. It wasn't because the dog was bad, though. The dog was juicy, but it still had that crispness to it like it would make a snapping sound if you were to break it in half. It COULD have been the bun, though. It wasn't horrible, but it was extremely dry.

Perhaps a different choice in style would make for a better experience should we visit this place again. 

As we were leaving, I overheard a couple of the customers talking to the managers about ideas for new additions to the menu. The customer suggested some type of Italian dog, and the owner was all for it! He also mentioned that they would be adding some type of burrito to the menu within the next couple of weeks. I didn't get all of the details, but I did hear ""burrito"" and ""two weeks"". 

Could be interesting...",2012-12-07 02:26:11

I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate.

I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.

In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.

Finding local, high quality sushi?  Tougher still.  Finding local, high quality sushi at a reasonable price?  Yeah, good luck.  When people ask me for a recommendation for a good local sushi restaurant, the first place I always recommend is Hana.  A small comfortable neighborhood sushi spot with good product that won't totally crush your bank account.  Chain sushi places can deliver good sushi too, though often at a premium and in a fancy environment requiring requisite attire.  Well ladies and gentlemen, I didn't think I could recommend anything better than Hana.  Until today.

As I write this, Harumi Sushi is currently ranked as one of the top 10 highest rated restaurants in the Phoenix metro area on Yelp.  Seriously, check if you don't believe me.  There's five star reviews aplenty for this place even though they have almost no social media presence and no website.  I live just a half mile from Harumi so this place has been popping up on my radar for awhile.  Today I finally took the plunge.  The restaurant is fairly plain on the inside with a little bit of artwork around food prep area, but otherwise just simple tables and chairs.  Seats about 30-40 folks from what I could tell.  The owner (and head chef) Juno and the waitress on duty both greeted me and seated me immediately upon entering.

To start, I used the Yelp Check-in freebie for free miso soup and edamame.  Yes, they honor it and both dishes were excellent.  For the main course I was going to go with their staple, the Harumi roll.  The waitress gave me a look like ""that's all you're gonna eat?"" so I quickly sprung into action and got their Oh My God roll too.  Crisis averted.  First, the Harumi roll.  Shrimp, crab, purple rice, and avocado wrapped in tuna and topped with a spicy mayo blend.  Fantastic dish.  Rich flavors but not as heavy as I thought.  Next the Oh My God roll.  The first OMG about this roll is the presentation.  They bring out the roll wrapped in tin foil while the tin foil is on fire (I'm dead serious).  Don't worry, the waitress unwraps the foil for you, revealing a rainbow of colors.  Ingredients on this one include crab, shrimp, avocado, purple rice, eel, and tobiko (almost like a caviar) topped with eel sauce and that spicy mayo.  Oh My God yes.  Not overly spicy (though it does have some kick) and the two sauces smooth out the flavors perfectly.  The rolls were both huge (10 pieces each).  Somehow I had room (or motivation) for dessert so I decided to try some of their mango mochi ice cream.  Essentially a light mango rice cake with mango ice cream in the middle.  It came as four little bite sizes on the plate.  Clean, creamy, delicious and capped of the meal in spectacular fashion.

All together the free miso soup, free edamame, fountain drink, OMG roll, Harumi roll, mochi ice cream, and tax totaled $35.  I tipped the waitress $10 as she was super attentive and friendly the whole time (even though she scared me into ordering a second roll).  I enthusiastically thanked her and Juno for a wonderful meal.  Between the food, the service, and (most astonishingly) the price, Harumi sets itself apart from a saturated sushi industry in Phoenix.  I don't live next to major body of water, but Juno could've fooled me.",2014-07-16 01:42:55

The oysters were fresh and tasted like the ocean. The mignonette was classic and they also offered a fresh pico which was also a delight.

The place is fairly nice for a Henderson strip mall. Decor is appropriate and tasteful, you'd have friends and family here; unlike most Pho joints that feel like a Vietnamese Robertos. Not that there's anything wrong with Robertos, it's just not a place you'd take a hot date. Saigon 8 is. Actually,  a ""best I can get right now"" date or ""I'm feeling fat/unemployed"" kinda date, but regardless, you won't be ashamed of this place.

The Pho is excellent. Standard pho gringo rules apply with Pho, stick with the Pho tai until you know what you're dealing with. Tripe is not for the unfamiliar stomach.  One amazing thing they do here that's apparently illegal in Vietnam: the veggie pho actually features veggie broth, and IT'S MARKED ON THE CONTAINER.

Also a fun game we play every time I call:
I say: ""Hi can I have a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho please? Extra meat and extra Jalapenos""
They say: ""(Vocal Noises sounding mildly like english that may or may not be confirming my order.)""
""I didn't catch that, was that a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho""
""(Garbles that may be English with incomprehensible accent)... 10 minutes"".

Some items, like the side salads, are pedestrian. On a whole, though, there's no place like it in Cleveland. The long-time waitresses, the costumes, the music... you cannot replicate the atmosphere. The place is for sale, and I fear for its future. Go while you can.",2011-10-03 02:07:25

Jade Palace IS that one in one hundred place. 
A restaurant where the egg drop soup is such a brightly colored yellow, It will remind you of the scene in Pulp Fiction where Samuel L. Jackson opens the briefcase and whatever was in it, presumably gold, cast a golden hue onto his face. Its that bright!
And the flavor? Incomparable. Rich with depth and flavor. A rarity for egg drop. 

The egg drop soup however was merely foreplay as compared to my entree; Egg Foo Yung.
Most EFY's are served patty-shaped, or, as a thin layer covering the plate. 
Not here. 
Here, your EFY expectations will be overly exceeded when as you see it being delivered, you're unable to recognize it as an EFY. 
Mountainous, it looks like a beautifully golden browned soufflé, hot out of the oven. 
You can't wait to sample it. 
It's then you discover how its uncanny resemblance to a perky D-cup is the clever result of not one, but several layers of spongy EFY goodness. And to augment this delight, (as if a D-cup would ever need augmentation) there's a gravy boat filled to its gunwales with a rich and flavorful brown sauce, tying the dish together in a tightly woven knot. 

A pleasant young server. 
Egg Drop soup with a flavor so extraordinarily rare, I can still taste it. 
And a gigantic EFY mound that was definitely 'more than a mouthful'. 
That's what i call the ultimate Chinese experience. 

PS
My wife had the Chicken Chow Mein, which I didn't sample until 3 o'clock this morning. It was cold, gelatinous, and served in a box, which in no way resembled a big golden breast.

The menu is good sized and had allot to offer.   The steak choices are smaller part of menu. But that's ok with what is offered here.   The meals come with sides but salad is extra.   Salad or soup is an extra $ 4 ($6 for lobster bisque)  They also have happy hour 3-6.

The choice of the night was center cut filet.   The menu pairs this with smashed potatoes, but I substituted gouda red potatoes.   The steak was awesome (worth $29), no fat and prefect medium rare!  You really don't need that steak knife.   The filet actually had lots of flavor, the cabernet reduction sauce is to die for.   The gouda red taters come in crock about 700 degrees, so they can wait.  They are done with just enough cheese to taste but enough to taste the taters too.  They Brown the top to add flavor.

Out of many hours on the stove, beautiful Sullungtang is produced! Korean options are on the rise along Spring Mountain these days, and they are great options at that! Tang Tang Tang, the name so nice they said it thrice, is offering up some quality Korean soups/stews. Specifically, Triple Tang is about Sullungtang, and variations on Sullungtang, though other soups and stews round-out their menu. Technically speaking, this is the best Sullungtang that I know of in Vegas...though there is a very similar version of bone broth in town that I still prefer...but in addition to a great Sullungtang, Tri-Tang also provides an appealing atmosphere, with wonderfully friendly service...something you won't find at all other places in town. If you're new to Sullungtang it can seem a little bland at first, but the truth is that a wealth of flavor is lurking...waiting to be uncovered. The Koreans reading this will know to add salt, pepper, scallions, and of course dadaegi (chili paste). The rest of us should try to fit in and do the same.Once you nurse this broth a little the literal hours of love that have gone in to making this broth are awakened in full-blown kraken style.  

My love ordered the Spicy Beef Soup. This was tasty as well, but for the most part I think I'll stick with my Sullungtang. After all I get a craving once or twice a year for Sullungtang, and nothing else will really satisfy that hankering.

The food is definitely good (not the best ramen I've ever had, but definitely tasty). I am a HUGE ramen fanatic so I would certainly recommend coming here for a bowl of noodle soup or their excellent fried rice; however, do not let the prices on the menu deceive you! It only APPEARS like you are eating a quality meal for cheap; however, if you upgrade your food to the way you want it (extra noodles, toppings, etc.), it actually comes out to more $$ than you'd expect to pay for a ramen place. The bill came out to almost $40 between 3 people, which for a ramen place is HUGE! 

The service was below mediocre. They weren't attentive and they kept forgetting to bring some essentials... like water, soft drink, etc.. We did not go at a busy time, so unfortunately they had no excuse. 

My friend keeps wanting to go back for their fried rice and I wouldn't mind going back to try a different bowl of ramen either :). Just don't go here thinking you'll have the best ramen and service in town from of all the other yelp and magazine reviews, because then you will end up being disappointed like me...

The soup was good. Sweet from the carrots. The dishes we ordered were wonderful and decently portioned. The garlic string beans were fried. The garlic sauce on it added savoriness. The Peking pork chops were sweet and saucy but some of the pieces were too fatty. The tofu seafood hotpot had a good portion of fish shrimp and squid. It was really good. I loved the soft texture of the tofu. The beef chow fun was also great. The meat is not too chewy. It was tender and delicious.

We came as a party of 4. We had Waziri, Sultani, Qabli Palau, and Mantu for appetizer. 3 mains + 1 app was enough for 4 people. Actually...more than enough. Each dish had a salad, lots of rice, and a nice portion of meat. The kabob dishes come with bread. The kabob dishes were more or less what I expected. I live near Yonge/Finch which has quite a few Iranian restaurants so I'm used to eating kabobs. Afghan seasoning is different from Iranian. Both are delicious. And the beef tenderloin pieces were large and VERY tender. Same for the chicken breast pieces.

I was very happy with the Qabli Palau and the Mantu as these are new dishes to me. Mantu was unique, but not so mindblowingly good that I'd crave them. I'd recommend them as it's a unique dish that you won't find easily. With the Qabli Palau You get veal AND curry chicken (which is different from Indian curry). The carrots are slightly sweetened and soft so they go well with the rice. 

It's very close to a 5 stars. To me, price-value has to be there for me to give a place 5 stars. This doesn't mean expensive is automatically bad in my books. It just means food need to be expensive for a good reason. I've given good ratings to some expensive places before. N&K I find just a little expensive, especially when I have so many Iranian restaurants in my area as a benchmark. Iranian food and Afghan food use essentially the same raw ingredients except for seasoning. N&K needs to shave $1-2 off to be on par with the Iranian counterparts. You probably don't think $1-2 is a lot. To me, it is a ton because I eat out a lot. $1-2 per dish translates to 10-25% after taxes. It's like an extra meal every week when you eat out almost every day. 

By the way, like most middle eastern eateries, there's practically no service, and you don't pay tip. You order your food, get a pager, and get your food when it's ready. There's no one to serve you.

A lovely intimate/trendy addition to the Ossington Avenue strip, Boralia focuses on ""old Canadian"" - i.e. comfort foods and game meats dating back to early settlement times in Canada's trapper-and-hunter history. Besides the clever way the menu cites the inception of each dish in Canada's history, the presentation and flavors were all just shockingly GOOD. 

Started with a couple of cocktails that were reasonably priced and balanced in flavor. We started our food adventure with the chop suey croquettes, not exactly sure what to expect. Get these! They're delicious! They're like the wonderful taste of lo mein noodles and salty sweet umami in a light breaded arancini-esque ball. Actually, that's what I would call it. Asian arancini. It was such a tease!

The menu at Boralia is set up for sharing, so went with the sweetbreads & peas, hellfire salad, rabbit rubaboo and a special that night, pan-roasted duck breast with apples. LOVED the sweetbreads preparation. Sweetbreads - nice word to describe thymus and/or pancreas; acquired taste and absolutely delicious. The peas were actually sweet and complemented the salty sweatbreads, which were glazed with a wonderful garlic miso. Not overcooked. The hellfire salad was sheer bliss: ricotta and corn-stuffed squash blossom. Crunch, light, salty, sweet. A stellar choice if you're looking to cut the heavy meats. The rabbit rubaboo was a wonderful surprise: the ""sausage"" was more of a rabbit roll-up (similar to rouladin) and seasoned with mushrooms; perfectly complemented with beets. Probably the best preparation of rabbit I've had to date. The duck breast was medium rare, tender, and a generous portion considering the price. We finished the dinner with the hot chocolate beignets. These were awesome (fried dough, chocolate, sugar...can you do wrong?!) but I wanted them to be crispier and lighter. They were on the heavy doughy side. Still, an excellent finisher. 

Boralia provided all the things I'd want in a celebratory date night: inventive food, expert preparation, a variety of flavors, crafted cocktails, excellent wine selection, casual trendy atmosphere and attentive service. Score!",2015-10-18 18:41:46
NS40zU4SDALXznixzXHBLA,s5NcCy3L34sNIxPlNbJJ8w,26tPTT3jtCktaqowDEYSUA,4,5,0,1,"I know good boba shops, I lived in California practically my whole life so I KNOW good boba/tea. 

Now, usually good boba tea shops are owned by Asians -- not being racist, but they got the flavor profiles and textures down right statistically. I have a feeling this is definitely a local American run company. It's located in the San Tan Mall across Forever 21 near the Harkins Theater.  The design is like a beehive: black and yellow color themed and honey comb designs. The reason for that is because they carry honey boba, which is really delicious. Boba is a chewy tapioca pearl that is offered to be included in the bottom of your drink, among many other toppings (jelly/fruit/poppers). Boba is very hard to control quality wise for a business because you have to cook it just right for the chewiness and let it sit in a honey/sugar syrup BUT not for too long or it'll start to break down.

The menu may be confusing to some, but just ask the girls for suggestions. Go on Facebook ahead to look at their menu. Never tried any of their drink toppings? Ask for a sample.


I've tried a couple of their drinks, and I have a few suggestions. For the blended drinks, try not to add too much ice or it becomes too chunky and not as creamy as a blended drink should feel. For example, the tropical island blended drink: the flavor profile
Was very good: not too sweet, but too much ice killed the drink because it became more of a slush. I waited for the drink to thaw a bit and liquify and it was definitely a lot better with most of the ice out of the way. Thai iced tea for me is a hit or miss: I usually use that drink to tell whether a boba place is legit or not. It was good, the ratio between tea and cream was perfect. My only gripe was I ordered a large size and paid over $5.00 but didn't get it filled to the top. Boba was perfect consistency though.

Customer service was great, there wasn't much to say except that I felt bad for the three girls who were working. It was super busy and I felt they could have used an extra hand or something to not feel as overwhelmed. They were super nice and took the time to say ""welcome to fat straw!"" Every time someone came in the door. Poor girls were working super hard to get everyone's drinks out in a timely manner while trying to take orders and answer questions. 

The packaging of the drinks is a bit funny. The diameter of the drink cups are as wide as a donut, how am I supposed to put my drinks in the cipher of my car?

This is a small, family owned restaurant in charming Boulder City. I was not really that familiar with it until I saw it on an episode of ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"" a few years back. Pro tip: Don't go right after a replay of that episode airs, it gets REALLY busy!

It's not a huge place, but also not tiny. There is counter seating like at an old diner. There tends to be a long wait at peak times on weekends, so be prepared to wait - you can cruise one of the nearby antiques shops while you wait.

They are most known for their chili verde, which you can basically put on everything. This isn't really my flavor, so I tend to order biscuits and gravy or chicken fried steak. Both are good, but not the best I've had.

We visited for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. We had tried to stop once before for lunch but be advised they do close between lunch and dinner, so this was our second attempt at lunch here.
I love the vibe in this restaurant! The tables are gorgeous and comfortable. Service was exceptionally friendly. Our server seemed to know the regulars at several of the tables and greeted them with hugs, which I loved watching! 
We ordered nettle soup, the housemade kielbasa and pierogies, and the BLT. I had never tried nettle soup before and it was delicious. Very light and summery and I adored the antique little cast iron crock it was served in. Points for original presentation.
Chris's BLT was humongous. That thing was loaded down with ingredients and the bread was amazing brioche bread. The only downfall was that the sandwich was loaded with so many flavors that you almost lost the bacon. It was definitely there and a perfect texture addition but the flavor got a little lost in the mix. Not a problem though because all the other flavors were so amazing!
The kielbasa was fantastic and the pierogies definitely weren't mrs. T's thank god! (Seriously though restaurants that serve frozen pierogies in this area, it's a sin. Stop it. Log cabin I'm looking at you). We switched meals halfway through so we could both try each others lunches.
They only lost 1/2 a star because it took a really long time to get our food. We were there for almost an hour and a half. But our glasses were never empty and our server kept checking on us and updating us. Not to mention that he dealt with a different table complaining about their blt not having any bacon (after they are the entire sandwich! Really you didn't notice?

Holstein's is located on the strip inside the Cosmo.  

What does that mean?  It means that you'll probably have to wait a bit to be seated, a meal here is going to cost a grip, and you may be surrounded by that ""Vegas Baby"" crowd.   It would be very easy to hate on Holstein's.  But I understand what to expect on the strip in regards to the wait times and prices.  Besides, no one forced me to come here.  All that being said, the burgers here are pretty good and only quality beef is served here.  I got the Gold Standard on my first visit and amazed with the thickness, the juiciness, and taste.  It's basically a quality steak in a bun.  I recently got the Nom Nom Burger and it was good too, but lacked the thickness/size of the Gold Standard.  One things for sure, I'll be having the Gold Standard the next time I come back.  I can't even tell you how good or bad the desserts are because I don't have a sweet tooth and honestly, I just don't remember.  But I suggest that you try them because Holstein's is also known for their desserts.

At the end all your food is on the tray and you are met with these delicous looking home made brulees. OMG! Its hard to resist.

We tried the California chicken sandwich, lobster bisque , turkey avocado sandwhich and Maui tropical salad. 

Loved the salad...so refreshing and delicious. 5 

The lobster bisque was a little of a disappointment. I was expecting a creamy, lobster pieced filled soup like I have had at other restaurants. This one was more like mass produced, a bit watery based, no lobster soup. I get it that they probably go through gallons of this soup and they can't have people chopping up fresh lobster in the back so maybe u expectations were a little too high.

Champagne Doughnut filled with Champagne Custard, Topped with Champagne Frosting, Fresh Strawberry

Admittedly a fan of neither hot dogs nor foodtrucks it still strikes this writer as odd that Shortleash Hot Dogs was visited during a 15 month stay in Phoenix, but coming away fairly impressed at the time a return to the city shows the brand to have expanded substantially, several trucks now joined by something far more befitting my proclivities than encased meat in the form of fried dough.

Playing off the ""dog"" theme, patrons actually encouraged to send in photos of their furry friends in sponsorship of specials, it was just after 8am that I approached the small Vernon Avenue kiosk housing Rollover Doughnuts and greeted by a pair of friendly young woman I was sadly informed that the savory oft-cited ""Bear"" was no longer available due to 'lack of interest,' a half-dozen other options selected at the $11 discounted price.

Truly a ""cheaper by the dozen"" - or half dozen - space, doughnuts usually billed $2.00-$2.50 each, it was at a stone table nearby that seating was found for indulgence, items spread out and the New Year special ""Champagne"" offering glimpses of brilliance as the springy brioche pocketed rich cream custard beneath vibrant Strawberry glaze.

Attempting to taste in mild to bold fashion, a light ring of citrus topped in chopped pistachios strongly resembling a cannoli next to grace my tongue, it was unfortunate that the fritter was anything but a typical crunchy apple experience, the texture closer to a bready pull-apart without a lot of flavor beyond cinnamon to be found.

Back on track with Maple Bacon, the nearly ubiquitous modern-classic better than most as a result of natural tasting frosting and a hint of woody smoke, the best bite of the morning was next found in Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, both the base and frosting studded with dark chocolate that helped to anchor Salty Brown Butter Glaze.

Impressed to this point it was with ""Coffee Cake"" that the Rollover Doughnut tasting did end and although rarely a 'fan' of filled options the execution was every bit on-point with the fruity version prior, custard the flavor of lightly sweetened espresso quickly flooding the palate and dissipating slowly to nutty notes amidst subtle vanilla bean.",2016-01-07 15:39:43

Thoroughly enjoyed the grilled octopus and scallop ceviche appetizers. Their octopus app was refined and balanced, very well constructed. First a base of a wonderful romesco sauce, some patatas bravas (tasted like roasted fingerling potatoes) resting on the sauce, topped with beautifully grilled octopus garnished with herbs, an oil drizzle, and a drops of a cream sauce all pull this dish together. I dare say it certainly gives the dish at Milos a run for its money. Their burger had a nice blend of meats in their custom grind, I ordered it with the fried egg of course. I enjoyed the burger, but it paled in comparison to both appetizers. The brown bag peach cobbler had a nice crumble and a good amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg which I found to very pleasing. Great service this meal from Andrew and a very good overall experience.

I returned to Honey Salt just 2 days later to have Sunday brunch with my sister, brother in law, and my young nephew who were visiting from LA. We ordered the blueberry pancakes with lemon curd, corned beef hash, and biloxi fried chicken sandwich which were all quickly devoured by the 3 of us. What a great meal! Some of the best pancakes in town! Perfectly cooked, fluffy and moist with ample blueberries. The lemon curd was a perfect complement to the blueberries. Not that it needs it, for I could easily finish all the pancakes with just the lemon curd alone...but a little drizzle of the maple syrup is a nice addition to this plate. The corned beef hash is very good as well. Toasted slices of crusty bread topped with finely diced pieces of corned beef and potatoes finished with a sunny side up egg waiting to be cut so the yolk can run. The biloxi fried chicken sandwich was one of the best HOT fried chicken sandwiches I've eaten (Bunk sandwiches in Portland has a remarkable COLD fried chicken sandwich).

I had been watching them get ready to open since the fall as I drive by this location almost daily, and had been looking to find a place closer to our home that is as good as Honey Bears BBQ on Central downtown, where I frequently get my BBQ delights.
MARK MY WORDS: If the owners of Cherry Tree don't up their game and get competitive with other already established BBQ places in Phoenix, this business will FAIL before Labor Day. Here is why:

1-THE MENU IS INCONSISTENT.  It is written on a chalkboard and it seems given the various reviews I have read, different days have different offerings: like brisket only available on certain days. My wife and I were there last night (WED) around 645pm and they only had sandwiches and sides. No meat platters/combos and of course no brisket (My fav). I didn't even see mention of ribs on there.

2-THE PORTIONS ARE TINY and/or INCONSISTENT.. We ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich combo and a BBQ beef sandwich combo. Both with coleslaw one with fries one with creamed corn. The sandwiches were SMALL: regular hamburger bun with MAYBE 3oz of meat on each (think less than a can of tuna) you couldn't see any of it around the sides of the small bun, you had to lift it to be sure there was anything under there. A MINUSCULE 1.5oz container of coleslaw (the cheapest thing to make) offset by a fairly large order order of spicy fries, which were good, and a half-pint of creamed corn, which seemed oddly large next to the shot glasses of 'slaw. If it hadn't been for the corn and fries we would have had to make popcorn an hour after we got home.

3-THE COST. A sandwich with 2 sides is $13-$15. Sandwich alone $10??!!!! For what amounts to what should be about half that price. Why? Because one need only view Honey Bears BBQ menu online to see that they sell their sandwiches which are much fuller for $6.49. A combo with proportionate sides is $4.49 more so $11 for way more food. You can buy just meat at Honey Bears for between $13-$16 a POUND (16oz) all of their sides are $2.49 for 8oz, and that includes things like collard greens and mac 'n' cheese.
Basically we paid $30 for 2 meals that would have gone TWICE as far at Honey Bears, and they offer ALL MENU ITEMS ALL THE TIME.

4-THE FLAVOR/TEXTURE. It should be noted that the server who brought us our food mixed up the orders and I was given my wife's chicken sandwich and she got my beef and WE DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE UNTIL THE END! This is because they drown the meager meat portion in sauce so you can't taste anything BUT the sauce. She thought her chicken was stringy, I though the beef was a little light. We both agreed in the end that the chicken was the better of the two but neither was great. We also ordered a hot-link on its' own for $4.49to try it. It was like something out of a hot Smokies package from Safeway, and it was COLD. By the time we tried it we had resigned ourselves to just getting the food down and leave as we were starving and we had things to do later, I would deal with it on YELP.

The service was fine, but I got the impression the kitchen was being run by one or two teens. Perhaps in such early days the OWNERS might want to run the show until all the kinks have been ironed out from open to close. That's what needs to be done. You close at 8pm and don't serve breakfast. Suck it up and stay at work until you are CONFIDENT you are running a tight ship.

I worked in restaurants for 22years. The restaurant business is tough. If you want to be successful you have to know your established competition, know EXACTLY what they offer their customers and how, for what price and then do BETTER. Otherwise the contrast is glaring and you will fail. Simple as that. One need look no further than Honey Bears BBQ, an established, respected and loved business with 2 locations in the area to see where Cherry Tree is falling WAY short of the mark.

No one is reinventing BBQ. It's been around a long time. My mother has a house in North Carolina and I KNOW BBQ. Cherry Tree isn't worth it by a long shot. Take the $10 you'll save and drive to Honey Bears or any other well established BBQ place and enjoy your BBQ experience. 

I won't be back to Cherry Tree because there is no need to ever go back. I  drive by 2 other places all the time that I know are good. Perhaps it's time to channel Ben Franklin and put that Cherry Tree out of its misery? I will monitor this place on YELP, but am skeptical they can make the drastic changes they need to in order to be a competitor. I have a feeling this place was opened by someone who felt they had skills at BBQ at home, but had never operated or worked in  a successful restaurant. Maybe Honey Bears is accepting applications? You think Im being glib (which I am) but I'm serious. The guy who owns wildly successful Lolo's Chicken and Waffles was a cook at a chicken and waffles place for long enough to learn the business and then make it better.",2015-02-05 17:21:44

The flatbread pizza is a menu highlight, and usually there is something worth trying on the seasonal menu. The artichoke/crab dip app and the grilled veggie small salad are among my fave menu items.

If you're looking for something beyond the typical pistachio and mocha chocolate flavours of gelato, come to Baldwin street and try out these one of a kind flavours! Even if you're not the adventurous type, there's something for everyone. Tame flavours like Vietnamese coffee, HK milk tea, and mango are crowd pleasers while the adventurous will find something new in green bean coconut, durian, and red bean white chocolate, among many others. 

The flavours I have tried are all wonderful and just so yummy. It's a great way to cap off a night if you just had dinner on Baldwin. There are special waffle cones (black sesame and seaweed from my observation) that I'd like to try sometime. A friend had black sesame last time and was pleasantly surprised to find out it was a little on the savoury side; a really nice compliment to her mango scoop.

Like an average gelato house or other good ice cream parlours, they have little spoons for tasting. I wish they would use wooden spoons, or something biodegradable, however, as I'm sure they fly through thousands of those little plastic spoons only to end up in the trash after mere seconds of a taste. That's my only criticism, but it is one of great concern. I'll be back for sure, I just hope you guys look into spoons that are a little more environmentally friendly!",2014-07-31 06:44:51

The service was good and I really didn't have any complaints there. One disappointment was the valet service charging $5 to park your car when there isn't nearly enough onsite parking to begin with. Also, I was shocked last night to see they'd changed to frozen French fries. This caliber of a place should NOT be serving frozen food. I tried the burger and it was decent, not excellent and not bad. It definitely was not worth $12 though. It had double patties, but they were dry due to being so thin. The sautéed onions mayo and pickled cucumber slices saved it. The brooch bun was fresh and toasted, but slightly charred which I wasn't happy with. I won't order this again. My glass of eye chart wine was $11. My friends enjoyed the quinoa vege dish, the chicken sandwich, the veges, and the French onion soup. The vege side was an upcharge though and was only sautéed summer squash, same as was in the quinoa dish. Both of those seem over priced.

Today I went to drive thru and one car was at the pick-up window and one car was in front of me at the speaker/menu board.  I waited - waited - and waited for him to order so I could pull up and order.  Then I realized what the problem was.  They took his order at the speaker/menu and as he pulled up to window, I pulled up to speaker/menu and was asked to ""Please wait.""  As car in front pulled away from the pick-up window, I was finally told (via speaker) to proceed with my order.  While I was at the pick-up window, I looked in my rear view mirror to see the car behind me still waiting at the speaker/menu board.  WHAT?????  It was 11:00 AM!!  

Now, on to my order:  Chicken Caesar Wrap was literally thrown together.  When I opened the paper, the wrap was basically just a tortilla with lettuce and chicken on top, barely folded up into a ""wrap.""   Ordered unsweetened tea, but actually received sweet tea!!  Ordered a small Baja Salad - which was fine.  I did have to request a knife and fork.   My order wasn't messed up too badly this time, but it is irritating to order something and not receive what you ordered.   Many times I have requested no cheese, yet received cheese and ordered extra pickles and not received any pickles.  Arrgh!!!!  FRUSTRATING!!! 

On one occasion, I went inside to place my to-go order and Wendy's had some ""big men"" in suits behind the counter.  One little older woman behind the counter  was trying to give orders (commands) and confusing the young lady making the sandwich.  The  day shift cashier - who has been there for at least 6 years and KNOWS her job well was trying to help explain what the customer had ordered, but this little woman would hardly let her explain anything - just telling her to keep on at the register.  Great!  Now we have 6 people lined up at this counter and none of the orders are coming out correctly.   

Within the last 2 years, this Wendy's has gone down hill with the service.  Seems that if you make any request (extra pickles, no cheese, etc.) it still comes the way the menu shows; IT DOES NOT MATTER what you request.  It is really sad that this has happened; it USED to be my favorite Wendy's to go to - not anymore.   I only go here because it is close to work.

The interior of Hanny's is amazing. The modern elements and atmosphere is different than any other place I have visited in Phoenix. The bar is large and central and there are plenty of places to sit, lounge, hide, or socialize. The restrooms are upstairs, which could be troublesome as the night progresses, but thankfully they do have an elevator for those of use who are not steady on heels after a few drinks. The service at the bar was slow, but it was busy and having good company helped me forget that I was without drink. The long islands are strong, very strong, 2 day hang over strong- but they did the trick. 

Hanny's is the type of place I would take out of town friends to show them that Phoenix is a city on the rise and not just a Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters type of town.

The rice roll itself is very thin and is sticky and when dipped into fish sauce...heaven! The bun bo hue tasted a bit different but in a good way.

The restaurant is small and I recommend making reservations way in advance or you could wait an hour or more for a table. Considering there are only like six tables total, it's understandable.

My dinner companion and I both had the tasting menu, which turns out to just be a subset of dishes from tonight's dinner menu. This was somewhat disappointing -- what I liked about ordering a tasting menu is that it gives the chef an opportunity to present a coherent meal to showcase his/her vision/perspective. Instead, at Toast!, each person gets his/her own (seemingly random) sampling of dishes for the tasting menu. The idea sounds intriguing in theory. In practice, unless everyone is willing to share, it leads to some unfair inequalities.

My meal began with a tiny but tasty bit of froie gras; my companion's starter was less luxurious -- he got mac n' cheese w/ a fried egg. My second course was a dorade (small fish) over wild rice (a bit dry); my companion got the short end of the stick again -- an unpleasantly fishy bowl of scallops in their shells. We each had a small, inoffensive plate of salad/veggies as our third course. Finally, my companion's hanger steak (rare and thinly sliced) outshone my cube of suckling pig (a bit too salty).  The tasting menu ($40) does not include dessert, surprisingly. In retrospect, that was probably a hint that we should have stopped there.  At the server's recommendation, I ordered the pot de creme (not bad, but kind of one dimensional, not as decadent as Dinette's); my companion opted for some old fashioned doughnuts (which had a distractingly gritty texture from the undercooked dough). 

I don't disagree with other reviewers that the ambiance was nice and that the service was good. Toast! is not a bad restaurant. It just has not achieved the level of imagination and complexity demanded of the caliber of restaurants that it aspires to be.",2010-03-20 03:40:17

Even as i write this, i think fondly back of the flavours at my meal last month - and about the simplicity of their smoky mushroom salad (the best i've ever eaten). 

Earlier this year, i read an article in search for Toronto's newest restaurants. I was intrigued by the culinary backgrounds of husband and wife duo chefs and owners (Wayne Morrison and Evelyn Wu). I was lucky enough to make a last minute reservation, and with the food Gods on my side, Evelyn made sure to come by my table, give us a little laugh and walk through the menu. 

It left me with a taste for the entire menu. So we pretty much did, minus a couple of dishes. And what I can tell you is:

- The menu is unique - and truly Canadian. I'm sick of taking out of town guests to Bannock and saying this is the closest to Canadian food you'll get in the city. I'm excited to be able to now take them here.
- The flavours are traditional - i've recently been inspired with the concept of foraging for your ingredients with native species and plants, and this is the first 'restaurant' in Toronto i've seen really do this - example - Pine needle butter and smoke mussels. 
- The menu is creative and inspiring - as a home cook, i left feeling like i'd learnt something (i'm on a quest to have a Chinese mum teach me tea eggs) and i left with a greater understanding of native and historic style cooking. 


It's really is a great experience - while a small restaurant, it touches all the right notes to give you a historic sense of Toronto, with a modern flair. Everything is prepared with thought and intent. Even the red-fife bread i had was such a welcome surprise. I can't wait to come back.",2015-05-31 21:39:02

Being that our family is from Rhode Island, I haven't had much food out here that's tastes half way decent because the water in Vegas just blows. 

We walked in to find this place almost quiet, one other family in here before us.  This is a small place with maybe 5 tables to sit at.  We waited for the gentlemen behind the counter to finish up making their order.  The boyfriend mentions, ""look at the Familia House Pie, that sounds good"".  We all agreed a large would be decent to try minus the onion and easy on the green peppers.

While the pizza was cooking my mouth was watering just from the smell.  We loved the crust, I mean don't normally eat the crust at all because I usually hate it.  Not this crust, I'm not sure what they do differently but man KEEP IT UP!  The ingredients here are fresh there's no doubt about it. I posted a picture of the left over slice because we just couldn't resist digging into this pizza when it came to the table.  Thank you for making me hold out 2 years to try this place.

I for a minute while I was eating I actually felt like I was back East.  Great work on the atmosphere, service, quality and quantity. We left so full..

The restaurant is located on Murray Hill near Little Italy/Case. There is also parking in the rear which is a huge plus for this area. Inside, there's 4-5 tables which seats about a dozen or so people. You'll also see one of the tables with a few board games for when students want to come hang out. Looks like a nice place to study as well.

Anyhow, we stopped in a few nights ago for some quick food. It's basically a fast food Indian place where you can start by picking a wrap, rice bowl or salad and then topping; rather its chicken, lamb, or meatless. I ordered the murgi tikka (chicken) rice bowl and my girlfriend had the lipta lamb wrap. We also ordered paneer & spinach samosa as a starter and a savory lassi drink.

We received our to-go order a few minutes later. The lassi was alright. I think it had a bit too much yogurt. The mint did give it a nice refreshing flavor. The samosa were quite good and the sauce it came with had good flavor. I even used some of the samosa sauce on my main dish. The rice bowl had plenty of chicken and they were well marinated. The chicken was very tender and the seasoning was evenly distributed and wasn't too overwhelming. The basmati rice was also pretty good. My girlfriend enjoyed her wrap and she seem to like that more than my rice bowl.

Overall we were both pretty happy with the food and the value. It would be great if they expanded their menus a bit more. I think having a few simple curry dishes would be great for those who are less familiar with Indian food.",2013-10-28 19:13:08

The Rose Sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. Not a very good sandwhich.

Service was iffy at best. The young lady behind the counter was very nice and personable, but the other two seemed like they didn't want to be there...aloof is the appropriate term.

The ONLY saving grace were the Keogh's Dubliner Irish Cheese and Onion Potato Crisps imported from Ireland. If this place is going to rely on packaged potato chips to save them they won't be in business long.

So a SMALL sandwhich, chips and a 20oz bottle of diet coke set me back $14 with tip. That is a LOT for a LESS than adequate sandwhich. I will not be coming back.

We ordered pan fried dumplings, combination fried rice, combination kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef. Be warned my friends, this isn't your run of the mill hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, it tries to be white table so coming in dressed in work out clothes right after the gym and before their dinner rush probably wasn't such a good idea.

Back to the food...dishes at this place are not cheap. Don't think you're getting combination kung pao for $7.99 or even $9.99. Our chicken and seafood combo ended up being $20 plus dollars because of an up charge.

As far as tastiness and portions, it was nothing special, and not even enough to take home like most Chinese places, in fact the entire experience reminded me of Panda Express. So if you don't want to pay $40 or more for a Chinese dinner this isn't the place for you.",2017-08-30 01:24:15

The lobster bisque (Friday's only) is very tasty, but sometimes is extra thick and gravy like. Their grilled fish is usually always good. Thier zingers are superb.

tymrAgtJRi9e1fTAzFHYAg,Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,4tiFtmGNFcvKRSPXPVT8Hw,2,2,4,0,"We had such high hopes for this place. 1st it was taking over one of our favorite burger & bloody mary places in Vegas, LBS so I guess the expectation was high. We went on July 4th afternoon. we got there about 5 minutes to 4pm where we were told in a very terse voice that ""We don't open until 4pm"" - no offer of you can wait etc but being the rude NYC transplant I am, I plopped my arse down on one of their hobbit sized chairs and waited. 
Ok 1st lets just say.. you are leasing space in a prime spot in a very busy casino and it's on a holiday - perhaps you should look at your market - and not stick to rules that apply to cities that are 10x the size of your local market. In NYC & Chicago maybe you can open for 6 hours a day and make your rent - but in Vegas that is a 24/7 tourist town where you are in a LOCALS casino.. perhaps you need to adjust for that. 

We were finally seated at 401pm. after some discussion between the staff of who to give us to.. You'd think they'd never viewed a 6'8"" tall person and a 5'8"" fat person before. 

Finally we were seated and our very peppy (and nice) waitress told us they were new & they served family style like a tapas bar. that confused me. family style is usually giant bowls/platters of food shared among all parties & tapas is small plates of food which your order many to share or not. oh and 3 times with the ""we're new and just opened"" - kewl. No problem with that. we know - we've seen the hype. 

Drinks: 
cocktails: we ordered Bloody mary's. pretty standard for any stocked bar. Nope. not one. not even any tomato juice to fake one. reason? ""We're new"" - so we ordered one of their shots of mescal & a glass of sangria. the shot was fine - the sangria was a mix of odd flavors none of which were to be associated with any sangria i've ever experienced in the 40 years I've been imbibing. & that would be ok if it was drinkable. 
so I McGuyvered my own. I ordered a shot of vodka and an empty glass, 2 orders of their roja salsa - grabbed the lime from the sangria and wallah a Bloody mary. 

Food: 
Corn on the cob: delicious. 
Salsas: very good especially their salsa verde, nice full flavor with the roasted tomitilloes shining through the right amount of spice. 
2 orders of tacos in lettuce cups (nice option since they don't have 1 flour tortilla in the place) carne - tender meat and nicely spiced. pastor: dry. 
Chicken enchiladas: it's been 12 days and actually I don't even remember how they tasted so it must not have made an impression. 

Service: 
Other than the major discussion at 355-401pm over us - btw - we could hear you, ladies - our service was ok. nothing special. I guess because they were new. LOL 
The manager came over and looked quizzically at my McGuyvered Bloody mary glass so I explained my situation. I'm pretty sure they overstaffed since they were new. and he took the sangria off my bill. 

Total bill with 2 shots: 90.00 + 20% tip. 

Now for what you've been waiting for and why it's only 2 stars. 
the hobbit chairs are hella uncomfortable for a person over 6' tall. yes they have bench seating but humpy so not much better. 
no bloody marys is a personal choice. 
Hours of operation
the stage whispered discussion when we arrived 5 minutes early (and in my defense their door was open and there were people milling about.. did i know it wasn't open? no i didn't. did i know the milling people were actually staff? no i didn't. sorry we interrupted your party) 
This is ""mexican"" food as envisioned by Victoria Beckham or maybe even Selma Hayek as touted on their website (which btw has NO hours listed) - and if that is your preference, this is a great place to be seen eating and sipping chic drinks. 
it is not a place for people who are fans of street food straight off the back streets of Mazatlan sans the expended bullets or those who think authentic mex is what you get at Taco bell.",2014-07-16 17:50:09

The food is relatively good quality.   I wouldn't call it gourmet Korean but is more like comfort food level.
Tried the LA ribs, bulgogi, seafood pancake, bimbimbap.  All were good but not exceptional.
The stone pot for the bimbimbap is not always heated thoroughly enough so that the first time we had it, the rice was kind of mushy.  The kimchi appetizers are a bit sparse as only a selection of three but adequate.  Usually just sprouts, pickled daikon, and Kim chi.  Although we had the honey potatoes the last time.
Will need to try the hotpots as it seems like lots of customers order it.  Looks good.
Owner guy is really nice.  And service is better than typical Korean restaurants.  They have a little call bell system which helps a lot.  The owner helped identify where there were egg or milk concerns (watch the KFC as they marinate it in milk powder before frying) also.

What we ate:
1. machaca burrito-according to my son this was one of the best burritos he has had in a while..it was $3.50 and he ate it in like 4 bites..a bit small.

2. Jade red pork quesadilla, jerk chicken, white rice- the rice was fine, the quesadilla only had a few pieces of pork and the chunks were huge and very very dry and tough. That jerk chicken was the most awful thing I have ever tasted !!!! that was not jerk chicken...it was soaked, dredged in nothing but black pepper, I almost choked. Jerk should be spicy and I am a fan of the spice, this was not edible in any way.

3. carnitas burrito, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice-the chicken was average, tasted like sweet and sour chicken, the jerk fried rice was almost as overpowering as the chicken, but edible. the carnitas was like no other we have ever seen...shredded beyond belief and a weird spinach flavor to it. we asked if spinach was in it and was told it was cilantro. The cilantro may have taken on a bitter flavor from being cooked for so long...whatever the case ...the flavor was just odd and had a horrible after taste for hours.

Very good bowl of beef noodle
Variety of beef noodle options

Cons:
Parking might be hard to find during peak hours

Being a lover of beef noodle, I can't believe I have not reviewed this place before.  Better late than never I guess.  If you love Taiwanese beef noodle. you definitely need to give Mei Nung a try.

Mei Nung is located inside First Markham place.  If you've ever been to this place during peak times, you know parking is a pain in the you know what.  Just keep that in mind when you come to this place.  OK, now on to the good parts!

Mei Nung offers a variety of different types of beef noodle.  Most places usually offer the one bowl name braised beef noodle.  Mei Nung gives you the option of having different types of beef in your noodle. They also have some dry noodle options for days where you're not feeling soup.  This is something I really like about this place.  Some people like fattier cuts of beef and some people the leaner cuts.  Mei Nung has something to satisfy every beef noodle lover.  The dry noodles are great when it's hot and I don't want a hot bowl of soup.

The first time I came here long ago, I found the broth a little on the saltier side.  Recently I've noticed that they've toned down the sodium levels while still maintaining great flavour to the broth!!  Yay!!

The staff working while I was there with my 2 little ones were extremely helpful and patient.  Even though the place is on the small side, they do have a good amount of seats and turnover at this place is usually very quick so long wait times are a rare occurrence.

I really like Mei Nung.  It's one of my go to spots for beef noodle cravings.  As long as you are OK with the occasional smelly tofu order, you've got nothing to worry about!",2017-10-03 11:39:06

This particular location is a Pickle Barrel Grand (if I'm not mistaken) and has a huge menu and a very large dining room with a bar on the upper level.

I've had some bad experiences at this particular location but my coworker suggested it for lunch so I figured I'd give it another try. The menu here is huge and daunting. Do yourself a favor and check it out in advance of coming. For those of you on a diet, avoid this place at all costs. Very few if any dishes come in under 500 calories and the sodium is off the charts.

That being said, they do have some tasty food here. This time around I had the turkey burger with brie. It was tasty but it fell apart as I was eating it and it became a fork and knife kind of experience. I had sweet potato fries on the side and while they were kind of boring, the spicy chipotle mayo they served with it was tasty. The grilled cheese here is a simple but super tasty dish I've had many times, and the club is also very good. The chicken fingers are on par with other restaurants and the drinks here (alcoholic ones) are very tasty.

One thing to beware of here is the potentially slowwwwwwww service. I've never had slower or more laid back service anywhere compared to here. Servers take their time with everything, so if you're looking for a quick lunch, get takeout or go to the food court. I've had lunch here before and it was a two hour affair, not because we wanted to stay but because our server disappeared and no one else would get our bill.

Absurdly poor excuse for a newpaper.  

Quick Review™
+ N/A. Wait ... no. Parking is free*. Online stories are free, although I wouldn't suggest reading any of them. (*As of the date of publishing.)

- Sherman. That lil' twerp Frederick Sherman. Who-would-ever invest in such a vile lil' creep by employing him is suspect. Suspect.

- They don't even possess the decency to act like journalists most of the time. 

------------------------------------------

Truly trash. 

In fact, this rag of a paper is not even fit for trash. 

One should not sully one's trash by putting this preposterous excuse for a newspaper along with used tampons, cat litter, or common toilet paper. 

I would not even line a birdcage with this pathetically poor excuse for journalism. I would not read it even if it were free**. (**It is -- online -- but, one is bombarded with gaming adverts as a result.)

Lesser than garbage, it is worse than a cancer to this valley's feeble political winds. I am quite surprised they even managed to publish the Deadly Force special series; I suppose the saying goes that a broken clock is right at least twice a day. In that sense, it must have been a twice in a decade instance of the RJ getting it right*** (correct). (***They are right -- far right -- all the time.)

In terms of the RJ -- as it is known to locals -- it is permanently entrenched in the far-right all day every day, and mistakenly lands left twice a decade. During one of those rare occasions, the Metro critique was written+. (+ Right-wingers still cry about it.)

The fact that it has not been replicated speaks volumes. Boycott the RJ, and their website, and all of their advertisers. Boycott these losers until they are bankrupt. Boycott them and their evil Montgomery Burns-esque owner Sheldon Adelson.

Firsthand customer experiences
See that check-in? I did not do so while driving by a hundred kilometres per hour on the 95. I actually went to the LVRJ HQ lair/hideout and walked inside. It is confusing as fuck -- as any evil lair would presumably be, I suppose -- therefore ...

Pro Tip: once you approach and enter through the first gate make a sharp right instead of meandering straight ahead or veering left, as would be natural to non evil-doers. 

Once parked, one has to walk over railroad tracks (seriously) and around to the southern side of the edifice. (I am not certain if I am using that term correctly [I am not a legitimate professional writer {and neither is anyone here.}]) 

Head through the first sets of doors, make a sharp left to the receptionist. 

It is there where I was seen. I saw and was seen. Is that ""personal"" enough? 

I talked to a lady. My lens of how much I detest this cesspool probably painted my perception: she felt cold and dismissive to me. Such as, [thought bubble] you're not a billionaire clown like Adelson or Trump. What the hell do you want, Mexican-looking guy?

Maybe she was a nice old lady but I came with baggage. Shermanator baggage. It is my hypothesis that everyone absolutely hates Sherman besides Sherman and perhaps his mum.

In any case, she gave me what I came for and that was that. They're much nicer at the Las Vegas Sun (https://www.yelp.com/biz/las-vegas-sun-henderson ). It smells better over there too! (And they offer you a free print publication: and one that is actually worth reading!)

I will say it was still delicious albeit less than sanitary.",2013-05-14 18:08:58

Ahi Tuna w/ molecular raspberry, Chicken Skewer, Beef and Cheese, Lamb Chop, Mushroom Soup, Avocado/Tuna Cannoli, Serrano Ham, Brava Potatoes and the Santiago's Cake. Most of it was pretty good with the exception of the texture of the Avocado/ Tuna cannoli and the watery soup. I felt the texture was a little too soft and slippery for me. One thing of note was that Santiago's Cake. I would go back to this restaurant just for this cake. I will go back to this restaurant for this cake.

When you walk in, it's a great industrial/ modern feel. They have pop culture posters & signs hanging everywhere.
The menu is pretty simple, chix strips, slaw, fries and garlic toast, the options range in the amt of chix strips you want. I went with what they call The Box, I chose the lemonade, it looked fresh and was delicious. I enjoyed the chix strips, they were not greasy and actually had a good amount of chicken. The fries were the ole fashioned Ore Ida kind from when I was a kid. The slaw was ok and the garlic toast was great. The dipping sauce was average, I thought it was lacking a kick.

The first two to three visits were on weekends, and the food was average.  Only the most recent visit that was on a Tuesday lived up to its reputation.  To keep the long story short, the various chicken dishes were good but not better than other Chinese restaurants.  The duck dish was very good, not usually available at other Chinese restaurants, and was something one cannot easily make at home.  The fish dish was good but not better than other Chinese restaurants.  The shellfish dishes, such as clams, shrimps, were decent, and were considerately better made than other Chinese restaurants.  

In other words, there were hits and misses.  There were inconsistencies.  During the first few visits that I visited on weekends, maybe I ordered the wrong dishes, or maybe the kitchen was overwhelmed by the business volume.  During the last visit that I visited on a Tuesday, maybe I ordered the right dishes, or may be the kitchen could handle the volume just fine.

I wish the store was bigger with a bigger produce section though. I usually shop other places for most my groceries but this place has some staples you can't avoid or get anywhere else. 

Examples:

0% Greek Yogurt: Their brand is the best. Perfect thickness with the right amount of tart. If you like sweet, go for the vanilla one. I have tried so many yogurts and this is the only one I will buy. Get a big tub and just make your own servings for on the go.

Meatless Sausage: Again their brand. I hate fake meat. Usually makes me grossed out even though I'm a pescatarian. I LOVE these. I have people try them and they can hardly tell the difference. I make them with eggs and sauteed spinach in the morning. DELICIOUS! 

Southwest Salad: Another Trader Joe's brand. I swear it's impossible these days to find salads that don't have meat in them. This one is light with a flavor explosion. You have corn, black beans, cojita cheese, & a tangy ranch dressing. 

Meditteran Hummus: Again, Trader Joe's brand. I make this one at home sometimes but I will never match this one. It's perfect amount of creamy and zest. Use some carrots, celery, bell peppers to dip for a healthy snack.

Meatless Corn Dogs: (TJ Brand) I have never had a corn dog before except the vegetarian ones. I LOVE THEM! They are kinda pricey but worth it. 

Never forget to check our the wine sales. Always good deals. Easy to leave with 7 bottles of new ones to try at a reasonable price. I also love grabbing the fruit leathers. They make a great on the go snack.",2014-06-17 17:30:05

My breakfast was amazing. It had spinach, carrots, very crispy potatoes which were amazing, sourdough and the perfectly blended spices on top. The eggs were poached perfect and was not dry when you finally took that first cut. 

They give you a number for when they bring you your food. The seating is very communal but what I love about this concept is that gives you opportunity to meet new people or dogs since they let you bring dogs in.

I met a new friend just sitting down. Break the ice and saying hello is the best way to make things less awkward.

I headed over with my friend and it's a small little shop with one lady at the front. I let her know that I was just looking to have my eyebrows shaped and cleaned up and she went to work. This was my first time and the threading was nearly painless, much more so than waxing. There was a couple of times I felt a small pinch, but otherwise it didn't feel like much was going on.

Note# 2: Pho Kim 88 has collected a slew of awards over the past 4 years from The Pittsburgh Tribune Review, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The Pittsburgh City Paper (yes, their critics make it out of the East End and into the South Hills sometimes), and Pittsburgh Magazine. 

Phinally, I was able to try some pho a pair of nights ago at this dandy little restaurant in Castle Shannon.

WOWZA, that was a big bowl 'o noodle soup! A mess of thinly sliced beef 'n noodles floated around in the Pho Tai I ordered. 

Did I like it?

Yeah, I guess I did, but it wasn't the most mindblowingly yummy thing I've ever had. I suppose its brilliance lies in its simplicity, and I can see how this could be considered comfort food. It's also, as I alluded to, highly filling. Our adorable server, upon unwisely telling her that I wanted to order something else to go with the pho, became worried, saying in broken English, ""Oh no! That too much food!""

Kay glared at me from across the table.

""Dear, REMEMBER Burgatory?"" 

Indeed, the pho was enough. The beef flaps were acceptable, but as an earlier reviewer said, they seemed a tad overdone. The noodles were fantastically long and tangled and soft, the broth nigh ambrosial. 

Now, we ordered the Calamari Tempura as an appetizer but what they really brought us was the Seafood Combo Tempura ( in hindsight, their mistake saved us $2), which is a jumble of calamari, shrimp, scallops, and veggies, including chunks of carrot and green bell pepper of all things. 

I want their secret to making such incredible, puffy, delicate tempura batter so I can coat Oreos and all sorts of other edible things with it. And I used to hate cooked carrots too. I suppose I can be won over on brussel sprouts and liver as well if they are deep-fried in this manner. 

Of course the hot-oil-dipped seafood was a pleasure begat from pure sin. Silly you.

Guess what? They do fried ice-cream too, with that same tempura batter yet. As we double-teamed our dessert, we found that the batter didn't adhere very well, but we cared not. 

The aforementioned server suggested we share the ice cream. Does she read my reviews? Eeek!

Onto the service; Everyone was friendly and helpful and made sure we knew how to eat everything. I can't remember what Kay ate, but the owner came over and told her what to pour on what and all. Like the best ethnic restaurants, Pho Kim treats you like family regardless of where you come from or what language you speak. 

As we were finishing our meal, another couple came in. The female half was wearing a chef's uniform, proclaiming, ""I am famished! I hope you're not closing!""

""We getting close, but we have room for you always, doll. Sit down."" 

Hugs were then exchanged.

My friends and I decided to sit outside because they were very busy at night on a Friday night around 8/9pm. It's still cool out so it was a great place to drink tea and eat some honey toast! 

They have the 10% off per drink check-in deal so don't for get to do that if you buy a drink! My friends and I ordered tea, Thai Tea, Honeydew, and a type of Lemon tea (I forgot the actual name), and we ordered a Honey Toast with Vanilla ice-cream, bananas, and strawberries. The total came out to about $24. It is pricey because of the Honey Toast, you pay by the toppings. Base price for the Honey Toast is $5 and whatever toppings you want you get charged for it. Ex. 1 scoop of vanilla ice-cream is $1.50 or condensed milk drizzled on top of your Toast is $0.75 charge.

The sandwiches that are pre made here are huge!! I always opt for the capres sandwhich and the amount of mozzarella they give you is ridiculous.

I think it actually kind of freaky to see old dolls and trinkets lining the walls of Bent. My friends and I were seated in a prime and cozy corner towards the back of the restaurant, and I was staring at tiny Barbie-like dolls that looked like they would be coming alive from some horror movie...

In any event, I finally got to try Bent, after some hype about Brad Pitt eating there as well (I wonder if I sat in the same seat as him?!?!? *sigh*)

The menu is built for sharing - for a group of 5, the waiter suggested 8-10 dishes to share. On that note, we decided to order:

Tuna and Watermelon Ceviche - Refreshing, although I am not sure how you can go wrong with Tuna and Watermelon as these ingredients do not need any cooking.

Vegetable Quinoa - This was great, but again, simple. If I had to, I would order this dish again

Fried Chicken Dumplings - These were really good, although I almost felt jipped that I had to pay triple the price for something fried and, dare I say it, something one could get a China Buffet King (!)

Lamb - I am not a lamb person, but my friends said it was good. It looked like it was cooked a perfect medium (nice and pink) although no one wanted to eat the last piece

Short Ribs - Didn't get to try this as it was all gone! Clearly this was a winner

Lobster Tacos - Good, but nothing wow

Overall, I enjoyed my time here with friends, but the restaurant itself is forgettable. I like the atmosphere: dark, woodsy tones, chill. I also really, really love the idea of this restaurant being ""family run"" - a good opportunity for famous chef-dad (and super-designer mom) to show kids what the business is like and what it takes to succeed. Drinks menu are extensive and I like that they have a wide selection of both Wines and Sakes (although Sake bottles are expensive here. Our table decided to order a big bottle of Sake at $74 - the second cheapest option).

On the other hand, I don't like fusion-Asian cuisine because I like the real deal better. At times, I felt like I was eating Hype and Ambiance rather than Food taking central attention.

I would consider this a local-neighbourhood haunt which is another reason why I won't be back here anytime soon - it's just a little out of my ways.

Service - Professional 

FYI!

Reservations are a must. My friend, who booked for us, received the standard email that we would only be allowed to sit 2.5 hours and if we were late for more than 10 minutes, they would give our table to someone else.

So, unfortunately, the next few reviews may be bummers as I tried to get out of reviews being obits. 

The reason why I review closed places is a reminder of what these places did right and out of all the businesses closing, why these were undeservedly so. And it's also to all those newer companies claim they use focus groups and test marketing when the results are things we apparently want, like the way we were fed brussel sprouts as children.

Looking back, I think I rediscovered the refurbished Gold Spike (siegel version) after the downstairs café closed at Binion's. It was a busy weekend downtown and I wanted to get away from the hubub while I nursed a drunk enough to start to remember the incidents of a few hours before. 

The trap is they put such a delicious island cove of a bar before the 24 hour café, and you know the sun isn't anywhere near to being up yet, and it's my Friday (Saturday) so why don't we just stop in for one more beer? (I'll have to do a separate café review, hm.)

Gold Spike became something of a last stop before going home. Okay, the last stop before we went to another area with a cluster of bars. 

We used to make a joke that the renovations turned the wonky beat up 60's dive casino into a state of the art circa 1980's designed casino. And if you've ever been to Spike in those early days, you know it's definitely the Bellagio of what it used to be. But there was comfort in the simplicity of the design, and they used lighter colors. It's tough downtown away from the canopy for a business to pull off a dark look and also not appear shady. 

This time Spike was bought out by a financially more stable bidder. I never got to take part in the Sexy blackjack when they had it. Can Gold Spike do well as a boutique business with no gaming? The only business I can think to compare it to than I've been to before is Platinum. 

It's odd for a business to close a place right out from buying it, not maintaining an income, with no major plans they made aware. If there's no gaming, will the anchor tenant be another restaurant? A nightclub? 

There are empty plots of land that haven't been developed in decades, downtown. There are businesses that are dying to be refurbished- lookin at you, Ice House. Why close a running place?

The replies some people have of any development questions when they decide to speak for developers oblivious to such individuals goes like ""what have you built? What have you done?"" 

Businesses struggled and closed in waves with the economy tanking. We rallied together to go to our favorite spots to give them our business and went to events to support the scene. I vote with every dollar I spend is what I do. We're going to hang out the bars that charge less than $10 for a bottle of beer. (I'm being generous, I really mean $5.) Businesses charging Strip prices...

VIP isn't some place you buy your way in. It's when the bartender (or cocktailers) remember your name and knows what you're drinking before you order. And small downtown bars know and do this and have been around longer than the new downtown shoe-opoly players. 

Too many abandoned strip malls in the valley from companies that expanded faster than their openings and quarterly profits. Change can be good, when it doesn't alienate what could be weekly repeat business for tourists that visit a few times before going to the next big opening and not come back.

Good luck Fremont Street and Downtown, I remain a loyal fan!",2013-04-15 01:10:25

Naan and spreads: this was probably the best thing we had and bread and spreads is relatively hard to screw up so that's not saying much. I really enjoyed the different spread options. 

Butternut squash soup: while this soup had great flavor it was extremely sweet. Both of us could only eat half of the bowl. 

Black cod: this was by far the worst part of the meal. The entree was extremely expensive and I wasn't impressed with anything. It was all tasteless. 

I will say that the restaurant itself was very nice. The waiter was very friendly and offered plenty of suggestions. It's just far too expensive for the quality. I don't mind splurging a little and having a nice night out here and there but the food should at least be worth it.",2016-07-05 11:23:00

Felt like having rice anyway:

Vietnamese BBQ Spring Rolls: Actually I wanted the Fried Egg Rolls But I guess I ordered this instead.. No problem.. 4 Fat pieces of unfried spring rolls and a complex looking peanut sauce. I had to take a bite without the sauce to taste what I was working with.. Oooh Very nice! Great pork/meaty flavor, a healthy dose of herbs/veggies and a crunchy roll of texture! What a touch of genius.. That roll (looked like a stick of cinnamon) but tasted like a sweet cracker and gave that soft roll that crunch that I desire from Fried Egg Rolls.. Very Noice! The peanut sauce, wasn't the ordinary plain, expected peanut sauce.. It was obvious just by looking at it. Well, whatever they put it in there made me an even happier camper! Awesome way to start!

62. BBQ Pork with Broken Rice plus Chinese Sausage: Several thin slices of golden brown pork, dark red slices of chinese sausage over a bed of Broken rice and sweet pickled daikon (type of radish), carrots and cucmber. On the side for dipping the bbq pork, my server actually made my fish sauce mix tableside (water, vinegar, sugar and fish sauce, plus a splash of chili). The pork was tender, had a light flavor and dipping it in the sauce was Money!! One of the few items that you'd find in my freezer are Chinese sausages. I buy frozen packages at the Asian markets, slice em' thin, lightly fry and eat them like popcorn. They're Really REALLLY GOOD! Theirs seemed to taste a tad better maybe because theirs are supposedly never frozen.. The sweet pickled veggies were fresh and balanced some of the fattiness from the meats beautifully. The broken rice's appealing naturally buttery note was a Bonus! Subtle But Noticeable. Very Delicous Dish!! 

*Broken rice: Some history according to the server - Originally transporters from ancient times used to sift/throw away the ""broken"" grains of rice until it became so much that they decided to try cooking it themselves instead of wasting it. Come to find out, they discovered that it carried a different satisfying flavor. Now it's sold separately like a delicacy.. 

Pennywort Juice with Mung bean: Server told me that the this was formed from leaves that float like lily pads in the water and that they also add some coconut juice in it. If I were to blind taste this with Wheatgrass Juice, I wouldn't tell the difference except this had a grainy consistency. Not bad, I think it was healthy! 

Service Beyond what I expected in terms of knowledge of the food, especially coming from an African American Server! What's up ""Mo""! Super cool guy and a Very patient, Attentive and Easy to talk to. This place served up One of the better Vietnamese riced dishes and Rolls I've ever had. Value was there.

Now for the stinky tofu.  Firstly, it didn't stink that bad and tasted delish.  They coat it with a good brown slightly sweet drizzle (kind of like Japanese katsu sauce) and there are vinegary pickles on the side.

I walked through the front doors of the church (flashbacks/guilt kicked in automatically) to a camera crew. Apparently the Food Network was filming some sort of show because of their pierogies (which is pretty cool).  It was a bit hectic inside so we decided to take advantage of the weather and sit in the courtyard. 

The outdoor courtyard was nice and cozy. I have been in better ones but I have definitely been in worse ones. 

Food: I got the a Mediterranean salad, although I was a bit hesitant because it was $16 with shrimp.  The old man was footing the bill so I went for it but was a bit underwhelmed when the salad came out.  For $16 I was excepting a Mediterranean island on my plate...but no. My sister got the pierogies which were decent.  They were a bit cold by the time I got to them which was my fault. My dad got a fish sandwich which was the best thing on the table. Crunchy, flakey, moist (eww) 

Drinks: Solid beer list but I opted for wine tonight. It was a chilly night so I went with red. One glass of Cab Sav and one glass of Zinfandel. Delish. 

Pros: Architecture, Great drink list, outdoor seating, nice but awkward waiter, changing specials

Cons: Strangely expensive for random items, cheesy plastic furniture on patio (really? you spend how much money on redoing the venue but you couldn't throw some wrought iron furniture into the mix), food took a bit but I think that was because of the Food Network event.

It used to be one of my favourite restaurants ever but I'm dropping it to three stars now (it barely missed out on two).

In order to explain why I have to take you back in time to my very first visit to a Claim Jumper back in 1999 or so. It was in California and I was visiting the US for the first time. There was a two hour wait (which I had NEVER experienced in Oz - who the hell would wait two full HOURS to eat dinner?? #murica, that's who). Back then they had cards with words on them - like ""Golden Nugget"" or ""Prospector's Trail"" that they gave you because restaurant pagers hadn't been invented. They would call out ""Golden Nugget, party of four"" when your table was ready, I suppose so that your privacy wasn't invaded by your name being blasted out over the intercom? Anyway. We all went in and the first thing I noticed were the size of the seats and tables. I was wondering what manner of creatures needed seat benches a full two yards deep, until I saw some of the patrons. Five hundred pound people waddling about, it was straight up like being on that spaceship out of Wall-E. Anyway. Got my meal and it was gigantic! There was even a red apple on the plate as a bonus. I was amazed and delighted at the variety of foods and the portion size.

Fast forward several years to after I'd moved to the US and been living here for a few years. My teammates and I went to this CJ's for lunch one day. I wasn't feeling hungry so I thought I would just order an appetizer, and got the nachos. When everyone's meals were brought out, the nachos plate was singularly the largest thing on the table. At least two pounds of food, and my god was it delicious. I ate and ate until I was stuffed, boxed the rest and STILL had two meals' worth out of the remainder. Best/biggest nachos EVER.

They have an appetizer/side called cheese potatocakes, that are served with this white ""herbed salsa"" drizzle. They and the nachos were my absolute favourite appetizers of any restaurant. Purely divine. And then the have their prime rib - not spectacularly prepared or anything, just really well cooked and delicious. The prime rib became my favourite prime ever, over and above any steak restaurant I'd ever been to, except perhaps the one from Cattlemens which used to be on 83rd Ave in Peoria.

I didn't go to CJ's super often, because it is a little on the expensive side, but each time I went I enjoyed my meal thoroughly and it was quite a treat no matter the dish or the time of day.

Back to the present now. I went to CJs fully expecting to order my classic favourite, the prime rib. I didn't see it on the menu. And I learned that they don't sell it anymore. Not only don't they serve apples on your plate now, but they don't even have the bowl of apples at the front door that they used to have. They no longer serve the country's best nachos platter anymore. They no longer serve the ""I Declair"", a giant custard/pastry/whipped cream dessert that was the size of a loaf of bread. They no longer have the goat cheese and beet salad. Their menu has shrunk to about half its size.

The waitress was okay, but just a little clumsy in her delivery. She asked us if we wanted dessert when one of us was actually in the restroom at the time, for example. Nothing real bad but just.. *shrug*

They still have their potatocakes and those were still as delicious as ever. But the bread used to be this darker pumpernickel if I recall, and now they have some sort of cheese loaf. They used to have this amazing texas cheesy toast served as a side. Last night I didn't see that as an option. And my thirty dollar (!!!) one-pound ribeye was NOT worth thirty dollars. Honestly, I can buy a one-pound ribeye myself for eight dollars and pan fry it in some Penzey's spices at home with no drama at all. For thirty bucks I want something that's pretty damn close to Gordon Ramsay quality. This was a good steak, but it was absolutely nothing special. And finally, I got a honey pineapple margarita. It was okay, but tasted very little of honey and nothing whatsoever of pineapple. I should have just got the standard frozen marg.

Actually, we should have just gone somewhere else. I'm dropping the score here not because I got a cockroach in my meal or the flatware was dirty or anything like that. I'm dropping it because of my abject disappointment at returning to a restaurant I once considered among my top five eateries that has completely fallen from its previously-great heights and is now nothing more than an average crapbox place with woefully overinflated prices. The lack of a significant wait for a table on the Saturday night before Mother's Day seems to prove that I'm not alone in this sentiment. Bye CJs. It was real.. once.",2016-05-08 19:18:28

I was one happy girl. I shop with a purpose. I use cartwheel, mobile coupons, and I have a red card. I was checking out and the cashier Marco was very enthusiastic and upbeat!

What I discovered is that it is indeed a chain (be it a small one) trying to get that bit of the deli meat fast food business from the likes of Subway and Quizinos. What sets Which Wich apart from the competition is a more diverse menu as well as an original way of taking your order that set it apart from the competition.

The menu at Which Wich is divided into about ten categories, depending on your genre of meat. There's roast beef, turkey, vegetarian, breakfast, and more. Each category has several sandwich options listed under it. You will find both roast beef and corned beef under the roast beef section, and the ""ham and pork"" section has the ham sandwich, pulled pork, or ""The Hula"" which has ham and pineapple. 

Once you make your choice you don't go up to the counter to place your order. Instead you find a paper bag and mark all your choices on there. While Subway and other chains have one person taking your order and someone else asking you about what toppings you want and then a third person asking what you had when they ring you up, you don't necessarily have to talk to anyone (though if you don't at least say howdy they may think you're rude.) So this little paper bag has your sandwich choice, the size, the bread, the toppings, the dressings, everything you could possibly want. Don't like tomatoes on your sandwich? Then just don't mark it off, and you won't have to pick them out afterwards! You hand the bag to the cashier, they send it down the line to the sandwich makers and you pay there. When you're meal is ready they call your name out (there's a space on the bag to write your own name) and you're on your way. So they have an interesting way of serving you. Does the food make the cut as well?

Yes and no. The menu is pretty extensive for a chain deli shop and you will have more unique options here than the other guys. The cold cuts are of a much better quality than you would expect from Subway but they don't exactly match up to Boars Head cold cuts you would find at an actual deli or cafe. The veggie and dressing options are numerous and the veggies tasted pretty fresh and crisp. The portions of the meat and veggies are also more than you will get at the other places. One thing I did like was their chips that they make fresh daily. They are simply just salt and pepper ridged chips but the fresh fried sure beat a bag of Lays any day. They also serve milk shakes but I have not tried them yet...I don't exactly consider a milk shake a beverage option (it's a dessert!)

The service is pretty quick as you don't have people trying to explain what they want and don't want to the cashier, and the assembly line set up works pretty smoothly. Your first time there may be a bit confusing if you're not entirely ready to check off what you want on a bag but the cashiers were more than willing to come out and help newcomers at the bag station. The prices are a bit more than you would spend at the other fast food sandwich places but the quality is a bit better. It's a very good lunch option if you're in the Birkdale area.",2011-12-05 03:17:56

Happy hour runs Monday-Friday from 3 to 6 and every night from 10 to close. They offer some pretty good food specials and there is a good selection of draft beer to choose from. Deschutes Fresh Squeezed is my go-to. It's usually on tap and $2 off during happy hour. Personal pizzas with one topping are 5 bucks and they're pretty big for a personal pizza. 

I've had dinner in the dining room and drinks at the bar. Both are perfectly acceptable options. I tend to choose the bar unless I'm with a group.

Its a bit off the Strip, but well worth an Uber ride to get here.  We arrived at 10:45 am for the 11 am opening and a line was already forming.  Prices are about half the cost of Strip places like Bellagio Noodles and Caesar's Beijing Noodle 9, but food is twice as good.  Plus, you get authentic flavors and a free show in the open kitchen!

The beef pancakes are seared, little hockey-puck shaped dumplings filled with hot, seasoned and juicy ground meat. Our table loved these!  Eat with caution as scalding hot juices can hit your neighbor.

The spicy wontons are also good - mostly sweet and salty, with very smooth dumpling skin.  They have the Sichuan peppercorn flavors but the heat is manageable.

Pot Stickers were properly seared and crispy on the bottom, almost forming a flower-like presentation.  These were also popular with our group.

Finally the noodle bowls - each ranging from $9-$10 or so.  You get the option of hand pulled, knife cut, or regular noodles.  Not sure why anyone would choose regular - that's like asking for pre-packaged noodles.

The Shang Beef Noodle Soup is a safe choice with chewy noodles, super tender brisket, and still-crispy bok choy.  My mom felt my pork belly noodle soup was superior, since the braised pork belly had just enough richness from the fat and yet was so soft and tender.  My mom's pork rib noodle soup was okay - she felt the meat was on the drier side.

Overall, solid noodle place that's definitely worth an Uber ride.  Our server Ciara was excellent - super efficient and looking after the entire restaurant by herself.  Will definitely come here instead of Bellagio Noodles from now!",2017-02-12 00:50:43

We were walking down Fremont headed to Du-Par's as we were in the mood for shrimp cocktail when we saw a sign at Binion's advertising their 4.95 burger in the cafe and it looked good as it stated fresh ground meat daily. 

We are seated and the service was prompt we placed our order and got our drinks and food and started grubbing. However not really much of any service as our food was dropped and our server never returned other than with the check at the end. What if I had wanted a refill which I always do! Ugh

The hamburger was very tasty and was dress your own burger style with lettuce, onion, tomato, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard on the side.  The burger comes with a delicious red potato salad which was a nice treat or you can have fries for 1.50 more.

The low two star rating is for the bad service we received while dining and from the cashier as we were headed there to pay for meal. 

There was a Cashier stand towards the entrance/exit area of the cafe that we were headed to with bill in hand. As we were walking towards it this African American lady, (did not catch her name) grabs my boyfriend's arm tight and pulls him back saying she is on break come up here and pay. He was in shock, I did not see it because I was still in the process of walking to the cashier at the front exit. All I hear is my boyfriend hollering at me to come here and I see him at the other cashier looking puzzled. We have never dined at a restaurant and been manhandled, this was nuts!

As we are walking out my boyfriend grabs his arm and tells me what just took place. He was in serious shock from what just happened. He works as a person in charge at a well known restaurant and says he would never do what she did to a customer. It was totally out of line and inappropriate to say the least, that lady had no damn sense!

What she did was uncalled for and not professional. Yeah like we are really going to dine and dash on a 12.00 tab, if I was going to do that we would not have ordered a 4.95 special!

It was an honest mistake by walking to the wrong cashier station, how in the hell are we supposed to know she is on break?

54lbttiPZsNREAQsZSQ1Ug,BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,LNOnYo13ggdoEGD-syYHIA,5,1,0,2,"This is the best buffet in Las Vegas in terms of quality, variety and value. I eat here at least once a week. You can go all the time and never have the same meal twice. This buffet is a bargain at dinner time. For around $14 you can eat all you want and it includes a soda, coffee, tea, etc. 

This buffet isn't the fanciest in town but it excels at serving good quality, crowd pleasing dishes. There's a great salad bar that features several pre-made salads (think Asian salad, coleslaw, spinach and blue cheese salad, chicken salad, marinated artichoke hearts) and a fix-it-yourself traditional salad bar. Cocktail shrimp are also in this section as well as fruit and cottage cheese.

The Asian station is top notch with a variety of veggie, beef and fish dishes and good soups / rice / stir fry. The Mongolian grill is my favorite feature of this buffet! You load up your bowl with fresh vegetables (they have a great selection that includes spinach, mushrooms, onions, noodles, peppers, zucchini and lots more) then tell the chef the type of meat you want (chicken, shrimp, pork beef, Korean ribs) and choose from a list of sauces and they cook it up for you. It's always good and always fresh. They will also cook up a cheesesteak for you here too if you ask, or if you just want a plate of Korean ribs they'll oblige.

Next comes the Mexican station with MADE TO ORDER FAJITAS, several good Mexican dishes and a taco bar. The American station is fine with carved roast beef (usually prepared very well done), salmon at dinner and delicious roasted turkey. You'll usually find fried shrimp, fried chicken, baked fish and more. They have a good selection of vegetables here too, including green beans, broccoli, mashed potatoes, corn, cabbage, collard greens and other favorites like macaroni and cheese.

The Italian station is good too with sausage and peppers, a variety of pasta bakes, spaghetti, garlic veggies, and antipasti platter and YUMMY fresh-baked pizzas. I love the pizza here, it's so good but it's also popular so you may have to stand around and the pizza oven and wait for a fresh pie to come out on the line. You'd better move fast because the pizza disappears as fast as it's served.

The absolute highlight of this buffet is their dessert section. They have an INSANE selection of sugar free desserts. I am in dessert heaven at this place. Choose from sugar free brownies, cream pies, apple pie, cherry pie, chocolate fudge cake, lemon cake carrot cake, cheesecake....and this is just the sugar free section! They also have NO SUGAR ADDED frozen yogurt in their soft serve machine, another feature I go bonkers for! There's a scoopable ice cream case as well where you can get hand-spun milkshakes (sorry, no sugar free options in that case). I never eat the full sugar desserts but there are plenty of cookies, pastries and other goodies.

The lines here can get out of control so be prepared to wait. If you go at less popular times, you can usually get seated in less than 10 minutes. Go during peak hours and you'll be waiting anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. The only other negative comment I have about this buffet is the service. Sometimes it can be horrible, other times it's good. Try not to sit too far in the back, that's where you usually get stuck in the bad waiter zone.",2013-08-08 22:54:23

The only concern I had was the service. I had a reservation at 5:30pm and made a request to sit by the window for the view. When I got there, the seat was not offered to me because they were full, which is fine since they told me it's not guaranteed. When the couple sitting by the window left, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask if we could be switched over to that table since no one is sitting there now. Shockingly, the waiter snapped back at me with a solid no, because other people are waiting, they're very busy, and we're not the only ones who want it. ""That's all I'm saying"" was how he ended his response.. and then he walked off. As a customer, I was utterly disturbed with his attitude. A gentle ""I'm sorry, we have others coming in already"" would have been fine with me.

Later on that night, the same waiter came over to shift our utensils for a dish that he thought was supposed to be ours. However, it turns out that the platter was for the table beside ours. Again, no apology whatsoever. 

For the price I'm paying for this restaurant, I felt like the service is way under par and was treated with disrespect. The view was excellent and I did not mind the food though.",2012-11-07 18:55:08

Unfortunately I was not satisfied..... Let me just say that the tacos are the bad version of white people tacos. Meaning, not like authentic tacos and a white person on a bad day could make a better taco.  I ordered two chicken tacos, kinda on pricy side at about $7.  Dry chicken, with unidentified green topping... Maybe it was lettuce.. but it had the texture of rice or a mutant cousin of quinoa.  The topping bar was ok-ish , but the guacamole was runny and looked like slime.


Lesson learned. I should have known better by all the patrons flawking here in mom jeans.....

This is America; we love wings, pizza, beer, and puppies. But for some reason I just....ugh. I just don't like wings sometimes unless they're boneless (yes, that makes it worse). I'm a fraud.

Anyway...I was actually craving some last night, haha, so I went to Wingstop because Buffalo Wild Wings is too far and I'm lazy. I'll have you know that we got half bone-in, half boneless and I loved both equally. If you're into spice but don't want to die, I recommend the original hot and if you're like me and need to feel that sting in your eyes where you're trying not to cry or that sudden burn on your tongue that makes you feel like you're free-falling, then try the Mango Habanero; it's the second-hottest flavor they have. :)

Aside from the great wings - they have the most amazing fries. What's weird is that I've had the fries before but I don't remember them ever being this good. They were cooked just right, had the perfect amount of seasoning, and - correct me if I'm wrong - I'm pretty sure I tasted sugar. Sugar and salt?! Marry me, Fries.

Last but not least - did you know that the food is BROUGHT to your table rather than you having to go get it yourself when it's ready? We sat outside and I was worried we wouldn't hear when our order was up and suddenly this magical creature came bearing the gifts that were my wings and fries.

Easily found a parking spot so I had a good feeling it might not be that bad, but then saw a mass of people outside, then a mass of people inside. Uh oh...its got to be a 45 minute wait and I'm starving, so I started to think of where else to go as I approached the hostess stand. ""It will be about 10-15 minutes"" she said. Wow!

And it was about 10 minutes. This place knows how to move people in and out fast. Within mere seconds of sitting down, a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order. I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings, extra hot. Food was out in about 10 minutes.

Eggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes. All was cooked great. Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though. I'll give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. My friend said her wings weren't that spicy. They were pretty good sized though.

Overall, the service is what makes this place special, along with the cool decor. While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice, and a free photo which I doubt is actually free. My first time here I had a chicken fried steak which was pretty decent, but the eggs benedict weren't all that this time so I'll try another meal next time I'm back.",2015-06-10 02:28:00

I was, as usual, excessively early (20 minutes) and checked in our group and went to browse the nail color selections.

During this time several people tried to usher me along, though I preferred to wait for my group. Finally someone had me sit in the couch area and offered me sangria (it was delicious but I wouldn't be surprised if I was drinking berry juice instead of a beverage that should have wine and brandy). 
When everyone arrived (on time for a 6:00pm appointment) there were enough chairs for us but not enough technicians and since I was sitting on the end I got to awkwardly wait in a chair while my friends got their pedicures done. About 10 minutes later someone stopped by to fill the footbath with cold water, and another 5 or so someone sat down and got to work.

If you have the dough to drop, Hanny's is perhaps the coolest place to drink downtown.  The vibe is hip, the design is chic and one feels generally three degrees more trendy inside Hanny's.  I usually only have rum and diets to drink and they are basic (as would be assumed), but the one time I had an appletini I was quite impressed.  As far as the food it is pretty snazzy as well.  The pizzas are flat and cracker thin, but the toppings are generous. I love the pizza with prosciutto, the four cheese one, and there is one with apple and meat that has a unique taste to it.  I also love the onion strings.  Great to share.

The new Elephant Crossing is interesting and a drastic, drastic improvement over the old Pachyderm building.

I really liked how the cash used to be in the middle of the floor, with products surrounding it. Now, it's at the side and the store feels like a bunch of intersections.

 I do like the nail bar, but it's always so busy in there that I never get a chance to take advantage of it. There are some amazing polishes with glorious colours and finishes.

The fragrance selection is extensive, but they don't often come in gift packs so I won't buy them here. I'd love to see some more boutique fragrances here, but it's probably for the best as I don't need to spend any more money on perfume. 

During the holidays Sephora always puts together box sets of lipsticks, mascaras and other beauty faves. These are a great deal-- especially for a lipstick junkie like myself! In my opinion, a gal can never have too many lipsticks in enough colours!

I love the no pressure browsing that's possible in here.

BUT at the price point (100+ a head), you can do much better (think Mastro's - or if you need to be in a casino, Cholla steakhouse is a better option).

Reservations: +
- OpenTable - super easy, table ready for us on arrival

Service: - 
- Host was a goofy kid.  Very nice, but awkward and stumbling trying to sell the football story (hosts have to carry the football to the table and tell you about the 72 Dolphins)
- Servers (lead + 1-2 supporting) were all nice and basically competent.  Seems like amateur hour for such a high-end steakhouse.  Watched as each passed my empty scotch several times w/ no one even offering another.  Too bad.  At 14/glass, that's 3 bucks a shot in their pocket they forgo...  still, nice, but again amateurish... no concept of cadence (drinks fast, bread slow, 1st course fast, steaks slow, long pause for desert menu, etc.) that you'd get at say Mastro's or even Morton's
- Runner who brought 1st course put my caesar down and as expected as if I wanted cracked pepper... when I said yes, she disappeared around the corner to retrieve the pepper mill ???
- No serious complaints, but definitely not up to standards of competing entries at this price point.

Drinks: +
- MacCallan 12 served w/ acqua panna cube - GOOD.  easy, but at least they do it right
- Wife's foo-foo drink - YUMMY.  Not exactly sure what it was (some kinda fruity gin drink dressed w/ fresh fruit/berries), but it was really good.

Dinner: + / -
- Bread was fresh and surprisingly good (to the point where it's worth mentioning)
- Caesar salad - YUMMY, real, maybe just a bit overdressed
- French Onion soop - MEH.  Turine and chess piping hot, but yet soup inside lukewarm (?) - soup obviously premade and cold - then put into the turine and covered w/ cheese w/ expectation that the baking would make it adequately hot...
- NY Strip - GOOD cut, WELL-SEASONED, OVERDONE.  Wife ordered Medium, but was pretty close to Med-Well (fortunately, she actually likes med-well, but felt silly ordering such on a 45 dollar steak).  Despite the overcook, it was still tender and tasty
- Bone-in Filet (special) - GREAT cut.  WELL cooked.  OVERSEASONED.  POOR Bearnaise.  My filet was a perfect med-rare and ridiculously tender, but unfortunately was a bit overseasoned (salty).  It was served w/ Bearnaise on the side, but it came room-temp and tasted like mayonnaise and parsley (bummer, I love the taste of tarragon and was happily surprised at first to see on the plate).  Still, the great quality of the steak itself made it quite good overall
- Mashed Potato - YUMMY.  Simple mashed w/ garlic+nutmeg (one of my favorite flavor combos)
- Sauteed Mushrooms - SO-SO.  Decent as a steak topper, but not much flavor (odd given the types of mushrooms used)
- Creamed Spinach - SOLID.  Heavy as one would expect with nice flavor.

Desert: N/A
- Didn't bother as we were ready to move on at this point and the menu really didn't have anything that looked especially great

Dining Room: -
- Loud, but not in a good high-end steakhouse way (like Gibson's in Chicago)... 
- Cheesy, amateurish attempt at high-end environment - silly signed football placed on table listing the cuts (same as on menu), but autograph is on the underside of the ball, so you're not even sure who signed it.
- Not dark, not bright.

Bottom Line:  Very high quality ingredients w/ competent preparation.  Generally solid, but not close to high-end service.   Should I find myself staying at Wild Horse Pass again (quite a nice hotel/casino for PHX), I'll be picking Ling & Louie's for dinner instead...  Just not worth the money overall.",2014-04-21 00:52:46

I lured my parents to check it out too by saying.. we have to walk this pho out and walked right into IS SWEET ;) 

Hiding at the corner, this place is at the very end of the business complex. Mind you, do Not park under the covered parking structure. Or you'll get your car towed! I feel the businesses around this area has picked up exceedingly well from having Viet Noodle Bar open at this location. It works in both favors.. eat some delicious Vietnamese cuisine and then walk a few stores down.. Bam. You got yourself a place for after dinner non-alcoholic drinks and at the same time.. satisfy your sweet tooth ;) The best of both worlds for foodie lovers!!!

I, somewhat lost interest in trying this place, since a coworker told me it was just O-K. Damn I should've just went and tried it myself before dismissing it as the atmosphere is oh so cozy and nice! It was so wonderful. I was admiring the festive decoration they've done for Halloween ;) That's the spirit! I like that about local businesses that are open to do those things that make it fun and welcoming to the guests. It made me smile looking around.. those hanging skulls, bats upside down, skeletons on the windows, spider webs, and mummified skeleton got me in the mood to spook someone.. maybe with my silly laugh that my brother says is something else :P Hehe, keke, haha, hoho.. wait that's for Christmas!

The kind lady that helped me was patient and kind with answering all my questions on what's good here. I looked up and Thai Lemon Tea caught my eyes. My mom was eyeing the creme brulee, so we got those to try. You know when you drink or eat something and that flavor hits you on the first sip or bite and you have this animated cartoon look where your eyes become hearts popping out?! Yeah... my Mom and I had that moment. That Thai Lemon Tea got me. Grabbed my heart and ran kind of feeling. Remarkably refreshing. The hints of sweetness from the Thai Tea followed with sourness of the acidity from the lemon. It's like your favorite candy.. This would be for all the Sour Patch Kids Lovers.. but as a drink! I can seriously become an addict of this one. I slurped this up in F1 racing speed and I was instantly yearning for more. I'm even thinking about it right now as I write this review! Someone save me!!! Heroes! Batman, Superman, Voltron, Optimus Prime!!!??! Help me.. I need this driiiiiink! *with my hands reaching the sky.....Is anyone there?!

Creme Brulee.. one word.. LOVE. Strikingly gratifying. That custard-like creme that just melts on your tongue. Oh... . I'm lost for words. Give me a moment.... ....... ........................... ......... . Not overpoweringly sweet nor lacking of it. It's just a masterpiece. You can't go wrong with this dessert. No way, no how. There's some magic in this. I swear I took one bite and I was in happy land paradise. The sun was shining and a rainbow of color lit my palate. Let me tell you how good this dessert was... I can close my eyes and sleep with a smile :) Get some.

I'm going to stop by after work more often to this place when I just need that dessert fix I can't get from anywhere else. And to be open seven days of week til the strike of midnight?! I heart this place to the moon and back and back again I go!!! Love.",2015-10-21 09:24:40

 There are two houses with a large patio in the middle of this beautiful property. The deli building which houses fast service and food to go is to the left and the bar where food is ordered and the taps, is located in the building to the right. The seating in both are cozy and comfortable. The bar side displays an extensive array of beer and a chalk board to advertise the live beer alerts.

 We sat on the patio at a refectory table, an elongated table used originally for dining in monasteries in Medieval times or the Late Middle Ages. Think casual Harry Potter dining. The water misting system kept us very comfortable. Chill guys and gals come to your table to serve.

 The menu is showing gourmet options and exotic meats including duck sausage with dates, Moroccan lamb sausage, and turkey loukaniko, rattlesnake and rabbit. Traditional German food at a Christmas reunion table, with the exception of the snake. I also see local favorite food like grilled artisan sausages, burgers, Belgian fries, hand-twisted pretzels. 

 Today I ordered up a Chemay Cing Cents. $12. This is a 99 point triple white with an ABV of 8%. Poured into a Chimay Belgium 10 oz., goblet. Shows its typical golden colour, a slightly hazy appearance and its fine head. I love Trappist beer. For my second beer I order a Monk's Café Flemish Sour Ale. $8. Lightly chilled 11.2 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. This is an 86 point dark reddish brown ale. Drinks like a cider. Crisp and easy, definitely on the sweet side. A good sipper. My GF ordered the Spaten Oktoberfest $6.

 We shared a sweet brat with an apricot onion chutney topping. $5.75 and a hard pretzel. The Honey Mustard and the Dijon are Haus made. The sausage was excellent and the in house mustard was superb.

 I placed an order to go for the kids. The Pig Mac. $7.50 A 1/4 lb pork sausage & a 1/4 lb ground beef with lettuce, pickle, caramelized onion and hush hush sauce. This sandwich is a monster and will need to be cut into quarters to eat. On looks alone it's a winner.

 Also I brought home desert for later. Drunken Date Cake $5 An intoxicating sponge cake made with Oatmeal Stout. I might have this at midnight, will let you know.

Ditto, until I went to Precision Dental. Fun dental procedures are not a thing, probably because most regular folks fear syringes, drills, & hate the smell of their own teeth burning. It also doesn't help that (most) dental clinics are so...like........clinical. 

The staff of Precision Dental (from Dr Lam to Eva, Rex, Jackie) seems to be aware of that, & clearly share the same goal of providing patients the best dental experiences of their lives. The clinic is far from 'clinical' in vibe, & Dr Lam tells you what he's about to do as he performs the procedure.

Everything is explained in detail, & in the event that you need more than 1 dental procedure done, you will be advised on which tooth/teeth are best prioritized. They accept dental insurance, & will let you know how much your co-pay will be. 

Right before my root canal, Dr Lam asked me if I wanted to listen to some music (through headphones provided by them) during the procedure. ""Hellz yeah!!!!!"" I thought. The whole music thing is such a simple addition that I'm surprised not a lot of dentists use it to help their patients relax as they drill through their teeth. Anyway, I thought maybe I wanted EDM, but figured Drake's soothing voice would relax me more.

Do I still like Drake?

If I liked him before, I love him now. We went through something tough together. lol.

Fortunately, I have made new friends & that was how I ended up here. Thanks to Cresta I., I finally got to try Monta. I had accompanied her on a Mommy & me day. I, being the, me in the equation :P

We arrived a little before 6 pm on a Tuesday. We had actually tried to come around lunch time, which was silly of us, because it was way too packed. However, when we returned, it was less crowded & we were seated immediately at the counter. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with Nitamago & some chicken fried rice. The rice came out first & it was really good. Then, the moment I had been waiting for, and cue the angels...AHHHH...my ramen. It just looked so beautiful & smelled wonderful. As I write this now, my mouth is watering & I can just taste it. It really was so comforting & delicious, the epitome of Umami, in the general sense. I just wanted to dive in and backstroke in there! I was totally reminded of the movie Ramen Girl, and I could just feel the love, and heart & soul that went into this bowl of ramen. Unfortunately, I have nothing else to compare it to. I have been to Japan, but sadly I never had the pleasure of having ramen while I was there :(

Overall, I really love this place & I will definitely be back. The staff is wonderful & gracious. It was a lot of fun sitting @ the counter & watching the cooking going on back there. Lol, I did find it amusing to see some of my fellow Hispanics back there doing big things ;) I'm pretty sure they were trying to pass them off as Japanese by tying their headbands a little tighter than normal though.

I got all of the yelp deals available before ordering: 10 for 20$ and checking in for free garlic knots.  Even with my 20$ credit, I paid an extra 10$ for 2 pizzas and 2 waters.  So far, 30$ for 2 people worth of food is a little steep. But then the food came out and our pizzas were bigger than expected. We barely finished half of all of the food we ordered and took the rest of it home, absolutely stuffed. 

The pizzas were pretty good. Slap-yo-mama lasagna pizza didn't quite live up to its awesome name (not to say it was bad, just not exceptional) but the BBQ was freaking amazing. I wish I didn't have two pieces in my sitting so I could have taken more of it home. Btw that pizza is just as good cold as it is hot.

Lee had never been here, despite having lived in Etobicoke for a number of years. He has been riding his bicycle past this place for a number of years, and it never really blipped on his radar!

So anyway. I saw the pictures of the yummy things, and I decided that on my next trip up, we'd stop in and I'd get breakfast there. The way the place is organized, there are several counters to order things -- coffee, hot foods, donuts, and so on. There's also a central checkout place, so you can pretty much check out anywhere. There's a little seating area with tables and chairs where you can snack on your purchases.

We went in the weekend before Christmas, and the place was pretty busy, but not entirely overwhelming. We went to the donut/pastry counter and were immediately overwhelmed by the choices. I told Lee to at least get a black forest donut, because black forest cake is his favorite dessert. He also got what he thought was an eclair, but was something else entirely that was still delicious. I got a maple bacon donut, and later on a breakfast sandwich.

All of it was delicious. We saved the black forest donut for later, and we were both delighted to find that it was actually filled with cherry filling, and not just the expected cherry jam.  My maple bacon donut was wonderful, and whatever was on my breakfast sandwich (Eggs and some spicy peppers) was yummy and filling. Their coffee is really good as well.

If you want donuts, make sure to go in the mornings! This isn't like Tims, where you'll see them all day. Once they're gone, they're gone! We went in a second time that same weekend in the afternoon and noticed that, fact, as we enjoyed some brownies and coffee.

Onto my review.  I went with my fiancé and first shared the mortadella and the poutine to share.  The mortadella was plentiful and very good.  Unfortunately, it didn't come with comp bread, just the meat. We eventually ordered rye bread (forgive me we have never ordered a meat platter).  The poutine was very good (I would order this alone). It was perfectly seasoned but the quantity was so small compared to the mortadella, lol.  We didn't finish the bread or meat, but it made a good breakfast the next morning.

For the main course, I ordered the prime rib and she ordered the butchers steak. Her dinner tasted much better than mine. I thought the prime was ok, wasn't terrible but wasn't the best I had either. The au jeux lacked in flavour (kind of watered down), but having the small dish of salt helped. Otherwise, the prime was like any other piece of prime. The butchers steak was cooked perfectly, and the pesto sauce was the perfect flavour too.

I reserved ORCH C Level 4 27-12 (balcony) for only $20.  I gotta say, it was a spectacular afternoon/evening at the enchanting theatre.  The Nutcracker show was as professional as can be, and I believe Orpheum contributed to the engaging performance.  The ambiance, temperature, lighting, acoustics, and general mannerisms of the staff and attendees were exquisite.  The velvety seats were roomy to sit in, except for the leg room for people to walk past.  The ushers & usherettes (usually called ""docents"") were polite and looked/acted like they truly like their jobs.  There were refreshments and a cash bar but I brought my own water bottle, so I won't review that part.  I especially liked that they permitted us to walk around the inside of the building (3 floors?  4 floors?) to explore and take shots (in/out), and not block some areas off with that typical velvet rope.  I felt I was walking around a mini mansion and not a business.  They were not decorated for Christmas except for the tree in the lobby  The powder room in the basement was clean.  Overall, it just felt classy and welcoming in there- including the box office where I picked up my Will Call ticket.  That's just the thing about downtown Phoenix ;)
After I attended their free public tour last spring, I had hope that they'd have a Christmas show for me to attended to experience a true performance and lo and behold, when I saw that they were having the Nutcracker show, I quickly reserved my seat before it dared sell out.  I love the balcony area which made me feel special and important.  I happily support a small local theatre and will do so continually.  Orpheum, please do not ever disappear or change your name- how about I suggest you bring back the original cursive signage, like the one Los Angeles still has?
I bet the appeal of the Orpheum influenced alot of the nostalgic feel among people there that day.  Folks were well-behaved and dressed nicely!  Thanks, Orpheum and the Nutcracker, for all your entertainment!

I came recently with a date and was immediately struck by the open atmosphere.  It is simple and modern - almost like a fine cafeteria - but it works.  It doesn't feel too stuffy for its price or its setting, and yet due to the decor and the staff it still feels like it has a touch of class.

We ordered several things off the menu, with a few winning and few losing.  The lobster gazpacho was... a bowl of cold soup.  It was started with a tapioca capsule of soup on your spoon, and the overall taste was light and refreshing with a hint of cucumber.  But at the end of the day it was still cold soup.  If you're into it - you'll probably dig it.  I was not.

The winner was the creamy mushroom risotto.  Absolute simple brilliance.  It was just delicious.  I can't and won't say too much more other than it is definitely worth an order.

I love tapas places because you can order a bunch of things and come away with a decent tasting for a decent price.  Julian Serrano essentially delivers this, with a place a few steps up on the price rung than the rest.  It was too expensive, about $35 a head without drinks.

First of all, the customer service is great, the servers are polite and apologetic when one of the dishes we ordered was late (and gave me a candy as a sorry, lol).

The seatings on the other hand can accommodate groups, pairs, and singles depending on how busy it is or you may have to wait. 

Now for the dishes we ordered, its 50/50.  Heres why: 

Unagi Don - the fish was soft and flavourful because of the sauce. It was served in a decent amount of rice but the garnishing of seaweed was a little too much for my liking as it overpowered the actual dish. Its a good dish regardless but I felt like ALSO that the sauce soaked the eel a little too much...if you like saucy then this might be for you, I wouldn't personally order it again. 

Shigure Don - this was an interesting dish as we never had it before. It reminded me of Gyu don because its made and looked the same, but this dish is slightly different in taste from one or two ingredients. There was a lot of meat and it was very tender. Very filling. My partner liked it. 

Curry udon - I surprisingly liked this one. It had a very soupy consistency, and not overwhelming while eating it. The udon was really soft and chewy and the beef was tender too. I recommend this dish. I would get it again.

Tofu cheesecake - tasted okay but it wasn't at all creamy and it was hard to cut through it (I mean, tofu and cheesecake are basically easy to slice but not this one ironically). I think its been sitting on their fridge for awhile. Its a shame though. It had potential. Wont order it again. 

Overall, it was an okay experience. This is something like a fast dining experience more than anything because the food was, afterall, made quick and easy. I would come back here to try their other dishes in the future.",2016-04-03 03:25:21

Steer clear if you're claustrophobic, but otherwise you're pretty much guaranteed to have a good time at this completely unpretentious neighborhood hangout.

I actually came with a group of 6 folks around 11pm on a Thursday night.  We hung out at a restaurant for a friends birthday earlier in the evening, but the birthday girl wanted to put a cap on the night at this place.  Its located just around the corner from TexAZ Grill on the northeast corner of 16th Street and Bethany Home Road.  When we got there it was pretty packed, but there was just enough space in the west corner of the bar.

For others it's the numerous toys and trinkets randomly placed everywhere (a little toy Gumby was right next to my bar stool).  But the clear standout here is the drink selection, which is listed on a massive chalkboard inside.  As massive as it is, they pretty much have to use the entire board in tiny letters just to list the full beer and wine repertoire.  I got a can of Lumberyard Red Ale from Flagstaff's Lumberyard Brewing while the rest of the crew got a variety of different IPAs.  In addition, the bar area was packed with numerous games to kill time with my friends.  We played some Uno and some Connect Four, and I'm pretty sure I saw Cards Against Humanity nearby.  Additionally there's a chalkboard that patrons are free to write on themselves (some of which, as you might imagine, is far from PG rated, but hilarious).

And surprisingly the place was pretty slow for a Saturday night which made parking a breeze though. The bartender wasn't much better than the cashiers. He never smiled, didn't acknowledge my order when I placed an order which left me wondering if he heard me over the music, and he just threw my change on the wet counter and walked away. And no, he wasn't so busy that he couldn't be cordial. And then when I did try my drink which was supposed to be vodka and Sprite I realized he had made me a gin and tonic. Bleh. But I decided to just drink my drink rather than interact with the bartender again. And then there was the music. It seems like this country bar is q little confused.

It was linguine noodles tossed with garlic, oregano, olive oil and the sausage. It came with garlic bread which was also really good. Based on the taste of the food and the very friendly server I would be back. The wait to get our food did take a little while, but that is to be expected when the food is fresh and made to order. Other perk of made to order is the fact that we can alter the ingredients if you don't like something or want something else.

Know your order before you approach the register. They will not help you. The menu is absolutely confusing. Symbols with no explanation are confounding. 

I ordered a lemon lavender tea from the classic teas menu. I assumed that meant a brewed tea. Turns out it is a syrup. I cancelled and asked for a simple brewed tea. I was referred to a list of teas mixed with a bunch of items. Simple brewed tea, right? I couldn't get her to listen to me. My husband asked for a blueberry tea. After much discussion, they were out. Absolutely no pleasantries or attempt at customer service. We drove 40 minutes from Surprise and left empty handed because the employees here have not been trained in customer care.

Second, location. Market Square is just such a pain to deal with sometimes...especially when all I want is a burger! Ha.

Overall, Winghart's is currently my favorite burger joint in Pittsburgh, and this location is definitely the best of their options. While it's a little cramped and you feel like you're practically working in the kitchen thanks to the narrow layout and intimate setup, the food here is simply superior and more consistent than their Southside location.

Our last visit also showed us that the menu has finally expanded quite a bit. My favorite is the Shipwreck burger. It's filthy in all of the right ways, with it's white truffle aioli, brie, bacon, caramelized onions and arugula. If you're not a huge fan of red meat, as I try to avoid at times, you can get the The Boomer pizza. All of the same toppings, sans-meat, on pizza dough. An excellent alternative packed full of flavor!

I actually strayed last time and went for the Collin's Orangutan with chicken sausage, green apple, smoked gouda,caramelized onions and bacon. Yes, it's as excellent as it sounds.

I've tried their margherita pizza a few times as well. Simple, but well-executed. Good fries. Good chili. Good people. 

Overall, with good service, a nice whiskey list, decent beer choices, and excellent food, there's absolutely no reason for me to not recommend Winghart's. Of course, with such limited seating, you might want to keep those recommendations to minimum, or your seat will be taken and you'll be left standing by the door drooling.

The batter felt like it was under the warmer for maybe a little too long.. It has texture but not crispy.  Batter lacked a little flavor, and the chicken isn't as juicy as we hoped.  Maybe that's why there's a good assortment of flavored honey? I don't have a sweet tooth so I omitted the honey.

First let me start by saying, ""Props to the decorator."" I loved Mickey's Hangover, I really did, I was sad to see it go. But, whoever is responsible for transforming that 1970's dive into this sleek bar decorated with two full bars, leather couches and brick walls, nicely done! It is gorgeous inside. The smarties even added bathrooms, something that drove me nuts at Mickey's (they only had one bathroom). The patio also looked cool, it had swings and hammocks and lots of tables/chairs for just relaxing. 

That being said, I think they are more of a nightclub/Scottsdale bar than a sports bar. They're website says they are a PAC-10 and Dallas Cowboys sports bar, so we went there to watch football. The staff was very accommodating, they set up some tables for us, made sure the TVs were on what we wanted to watch and all in all just friendly. I didn't eat, but the friends that did said the food was really good; I know my vodka soda was yummy and my bottled Bud Light was great;) Oh, I should mention they have some great drink and appetizer specials, too. 

The only problem I noticed was that they had clubish music on at 7:30PM that was so loud we could feel our asses vibrating. I'm all for the club, and I expect that scene in Oldtown, but don't tout yourself as a place to watch sports if you are going to bring in the DJ. Now, maybe it would have been fine if we got there earlier in the day for football, or maybe they can just turn it down a little and then around 10/11PM crank up the volume; sports bar by day, club by night: best of both worlds. (I feel like my dad right now, complaining about the music volume, hahaha.) I think they may be on to something here. Either way, it wasn't unbearable by any means, just kind of loud. 

I think Firehouse has a great concept, they just need to tweak it a little bit. I'm excited to see what comes from them, I think they will be a great addition to Oldtown Scottsdale!

Luckily on a Monday late afternoon, there was enough availability to book a reservation on Open Table at 5:45 pm, just one hour prior. I was able to walk right on down to the second floor and check in within 5 minutes flat.

There was a baseball game and football game going on, so the bar/lounge area (which is right up front) was loud and rowdy. Even with seating in the wayy back away from the bar, it would still be noisy. I opted instead to order to go, charge the cost to my room, and enjoy the Rising Sun burger from the comfort of my hotel room with the TV show of my choice.

The burger itself was filling, which made me happy since it cost $18! It better fill me up at that price! The Rising Sun has a Kobe beef patty, tempura avocado (love it!), nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and teriyaki glaze. It also comes with a side of fries. The burger was good, but the teriyaki sauce was rather salty, which really takes away from an otherwise yummy choice. It didn't help that the fries were salty too. I really needed the ketchup not because I needed more flavor, but to use the taste to balance the saltiness. I was so full that 1/4 of the burger remained, which I snacked on and finished two hours later.

I've been going to this location for years. It's the closest 24 hour coffee shop to my house. I used to frequent this establishment about three or four times a week. 

It doesn't have the best coffee drinks I've ever tasted in my life, but he atmosphere is worth it. It's just very... chill. The baristas are always friendly and so are the patrons. You can almost always find someone interesting to talk to when you're bored. Has very limited seating on the inside, but also offers an outdoor patio - with plenty more space to sit.

First, I was surprised with the facility itself, which was incredibly new and clean... and huge.  They shelter dogs, cats, rabbits, and even horses.  The dog kennels were particularly impressive, as every dog has a decent-sized personal ""home"" with indoor/outdoor access, a bed, and a water fountain.  There is a large playground out back, where volunteers can take the dogs out to play and give them some exercise.

The staff was incredibly devoted to these animals and seem to do everything in their power to give them second chances and find them new homes.  

I look forward to volunteering again, and am thankful for all of the work that these people do.",2009-10-28 16:17:51

On my most recent trip, we stopped in for a late night treat. The staff was super friendly and chatted with us and pet our dog. They let us try some flavors to help us decide. Honestly, I wanted to try every single flavor, but stopped myself and just tried a couple. 

I settled on a scoop of cookie butter (!!!!) and a scoop of cocoa puff (with cocoa puff cereal topping). Both flavors were out of this world good. The cookie butter basically tasted like Trader Joe's cookie butter straight out of the jar. And the cocoa puff tasted like chocolate cereal milk, it transported me right back to my childhood. my boyfriend settled on french toast (with a maple syrup topping) and brownie batter. I got a taste of both and they were great. I would definitely recommend the french toast, and the brownie batter was good, not a rich as you would expect, which I really liked. We also split an order of churros, which they brought out to us, just made and still warm. OMG so good. the perfect pairing with that delish ice cream. 

Bonus, they also gave us a mini scoop of vanilla for our pooch. In an edible cup, in case he decided to eat that too. I thought that was so cool, I love any place that loves dogs. 

I'm not kidding when I said I wanted to try every flavor. Everything was just so fun and inventive. They have flavors that I've never seen anywhere else, and every single one sounded so good. I'm excited to go back and try the Thai tea flavor. They also have a bunch of vegan flavors, usually at least 3-4 every time I'm there. The vegan strawberry jam is my favorite so far.

I can't draw or paint very well, but my wife is good at that sort of thing so I like to bring her here every once in a while for a date night. 

They have lots of different things you can't choose to paint. It all seems terribly overpriced, but nothing we've painted has ever cracked or chipped so I'm guessing it's decent enough quality.

In addition to that, they also have plenty of art supplies and paint colors to choose from, so pretty much any idea you have, you can make happen. Well... As far as colors go anyway.

Painting is actually kinda tough to get right. You have to paint several coats for the color to show up boldly, and if you want to make fine designs and lines, you're pretty much going to have to accept that you'll probably never get anything near perfect.

The ladies who work here are usually pretty nice, but I still don't feel like I've ever really received an adequate demonstration on how to achieve a decent result with the paint. Maybe I'm just terrible at this. I'm not sure, but my wife has fun with it so that's all that matters.

Today, the wife and I were looking for an AYCE sushi spot and decided to look into it on Yelp. 5 stars on 81 reviews- it's was must try!

Naturally, went with the AYCE option because it only makes sense! $26.95 a person. At about $70 total with tax and tip for 2 people, it felt a little expensive but maybe it's the going rate. We haven't done AYCE sushi in over a year so I don't remember how the price compares. 

The waitress was super friendly, the chefs were cheerful. We were the only people in the whole restaurant eating at 4:30 on a Saturday and I was pretty shocked to see that.

The chef sent us over a white albacore special (that we didn't order) which we certainly appreciated. If we were paying for stuff and got a freebie, it would have felt like an even better gesture but regardless it was still very thoughtful so we appreciated it! 

A ton of great menu options. There was nothing I didn't like. My wife is more picky than me and said she felt like some of the fish that laid on top of her rolls was a little too thick. I say the more protein the better so I had no issue with it.

Plenty of enjoyable options to eat, an incredibly welcoming atmosphere, and an attentive wait staff are all wonderful reasons to come by Honey Salt. 

Some of my highlights from Honey Salt: 
1. The Scallops!...actually the scallops are good, but the cauliflower puree and truffle sauce that they come on are simply delightful and elevate the dish a great deal!

2. The Midnight Rambler--Bourbon/Honey/Orange/Bitters/Ginger!..It is a Bourbon-forward, balanced drink...I think it is anyway...see my note below on consistency   

3. The Anaheim Pepper Mac-n-Cheese!  Why doesn't everyone use Anaheim Peppers with pasta and cheese?  They play so well together!

4. The Steak Tartar!  Capers and Pickled Papaya?...um, yes please!

5. The wall of mirrors won't ever get old for me.  Love the feel of that side of the room especially...and the general inviting feel of the space as a whole.

The bottom line for me on 4 stars and not 5?...
1. I enjoy unique/creative approaches and most of what I've tried at Honey Salt is fairly straight forward, with a subtle change here or there...I guess I was just hoping for a little more from this Farm-to-table style spot.

2. Consistency...I'm hoping they iron this out.  If they don't I would drop it a star or two instantly.  I enjoyed The Midnight Rambler a great deal on my 1st visit.  On my 2nd time to Honey Salt I received an unbalanced shot of bourbon with some hints of the other ingredients.  The lesson learned here?...See Leann (sp?) at the bar for a sure bet.  Same thing happened with the Free Range Brick Oven Chicken...wonderfully moist the 1st time--dry and tough the second...I would hate to have someone else order this thinking that I liked it if was not executed perfectly!

3.  There are a lot of tables in Honey Salt.  They also have a great wait staff that is on the ball and moving quickly to keep you satisfied...the overall outcome of this is like watching an ant farm while you eat.  It can be a little over stimulating.  Additionally, the tables aren't jam-packed...but they are closer than I want for a nice evening out.

4.  The bar is way too small for the space.  This results in a wait that could have been easily avoided.",2012-11-11 17:41:45

The prices for appetizers and entres are about average for a bar/restaurant.  I wasn't impressed by anything special in the dcor, but it was kept up nice and appeared fairly clean.  I came on a Wednesday night, and the place was pretty packed; it was tough to find a parking space!  The outdoor seating area was packed with sports fan watching the latest game, and the sets broadcast the events at full volume.  It's definitely quieter inside, for those not interested in watching a game during their meal.  Service was a little slow, but there's a lot of ground to cover for one server!  My drinks were ok, as was my dinner, but they were nothing to write home about.  I'd come back, because there's not much better in Chandler.  However, they did just open a Dos Gringos next door to Iguana Mack's, so maybe a diner considering this place should think twice.

Second time there. First time was mediocre. We wanted to give it another shot with a few friends, but got some of the worst service possible. 
Sat down at 7:45. Our waiter took 20 minutes to ask for drink orders. Than disappeared for another 20 minutes after we got our drinks (which by the way, he got wrong). At 8:50 we had to ask him for the bread. A table that was seated at the same time was already well into their meal. Despite trying to be very quick with ordering food, it didn't arrive until 9:30. 
I ordered the Burger. I was told it's quite good and wanted to try it. Asked for Med-Rare... it came out mid-well. Next one came in complete raw. Had to send it out again. This time it came with a manager who very nicely said they will take it off the bill. I thought that was very nice until we got the bill. It had a built-in 20% gratuity (for a table of 6 people). They apparently couldn't take it off. The manager told me he was ""not allowed"" to take it off. He could have cared less about the service we got.

I've had two visits to the Wren now, which is still looking pretty lonely in its stretch of the Danforth, so it's nice to have a good eating option prior to imbibing at The Only.

The FOOD:  Well one visit was super awesome and the other was pretty ""meh"".  Our first visit had a chill special on the menu that rocked my world.  Meaty, fiery, unafraid of flavour....simply awesome.  Others were also generally quite pleased with their food.  The second visit was much more markedly a miss.  For burger week, I had something that tasted vaguely reminiscent of McDonald's, but priced at $15 with fries.  The green chile chicken, while flavourful wasn't exactly what we were expecting, and the portion was a little smallish.  Overall, a bit disappointed.

The BEER: Their beer list is above average, focusing on local Ontario beers.  That being said, going out with a group of beer geeks, we generally could only find 1 beer at a time on the menu that any of us that was impressive. or novel, but let's not be too hard on them.  

The SERVICE: Universally pretty good.  The male servers are all in the lumbersexual style.  They handled a member of our party being given a beer he ended up hating super well...simply replacing it without complaint.  That's good service, I'd say.

The AMBIANCE:  Rustic chic.  Yes, there are wooden benches and Edison bulbs.  I don't mind, it's nice and casual and has a volume where conversation is still possible.

Once we arrived, it was a 15 minute minute wait. 

During those 15 minutes I spent my time in the ""country store"" looking at useless stuff for sale. I remember that other Cracker Barrel's in the south sold cute things and yummy treats. This location has very few treats and a lot of junk. Even so, it was wall to wall people and very hard to get around the store. 

We were seated against the wall and even with the shade drawn down I had sun beating against the side of my face and the other lady had sun directly in her face. Nothing could be done about it except squint. When the meal was almost over, the sun did move so it wasn't so bright.

I ordered pancakes and eggs, two ordered meatloaf, and one ordered chicken fried steak. My pancakes were really good and cooked just right. Fluffy on the inside and a crunch on the outside. Grits were served but they weren't that good because they were runny. Biscuits and cornbread came but neither were very tasty. Easily skipped.

I have not had very good experiences with any of my car buying from Fairway Chevrolet, but i would like to take a moment to share the most recent experience that my mom has had with her Impala when taking it into the service department.

Her car had been starting to overheat, literally for maybe 2 days.(She stopped driving it at this point and made an appointment with the service department) She took it into them for a diagnostic check and was completely shocked when they told her she needed a whole new engine since she had blown the current engine by driving it while it was overheating. (The cost of this new engine...$6000+) We are talking about a 2003 Impala with over 100,000 miles. The service consultant stated that her car had failed a block test and it ""appeared"" that the ""heads"" were warped. After further conversation with the service consultant, it was apparent that the technician/s who evaluated her car had not actually dismantled any part of the engine or attempted to evaluate the car in any other way, other than preforming this ""block test"". My mom the explained to the consultant that the value of the car was not worth investing $6000 and she was just going to go ahead and come pick it up. He then expressed how regretful he was that he wasn't able to do anything for her and offered a minimal discount and stated ""there was nothing else wrong with her engine, other than these 2 blown heads..."". She then inquired how much it would be to replace just the 2 heads he was referring to. He stated he could not give her that estimate since that was NOT what they were recommending. They were ONLY recommending a new engine. His very next line..""Are we able to get you into a new car..."" Really, are you kidding me.. what scammers!

My mom did end up picking up her car and getting a second opinion, and surprise surprise.. no new engine. Instead, she ended up having her thermostat (which was sticking), the water pump (which was having trouble circulating) and a radiator fan replaced. Hmmm... all problems that could explain an engine trying to overheat!

I'm pretty disappointed at the lack of customer service and honesty shown by Fairway Chevrolet. You think with all the bad publicity lately, they would be trying a little harder to keep the customers they have, especially those who are part of the General Motors family!  

The second opinion that we got by the way was from Hefty Auto Service.. Great service, honest employees and decently priced! The owner definitely understand the frustration caused by dealerships.. he didn't even ask or care what was recommended on the car before hand, just gave his honest opinion.

This was the first car I've bought that was almost entirely internet based.  I asked for a quote on a vehicle in their inventory one evening and the next day I received an email from one of their salespeople, Joe Spann, with a quote accompanying a photo of the car.  A day later, I went to the dealership and drive the car.  1/2 hour later, I was leaving with all my questions answered and I promised Joe I'd get back to him.

Fast forward one and a half weeks and I had seen a similar car at another dealership.  I got a quote there, in person, and I had a bit of comparison although the equipment was different.  I sent Joe an email and said I'd buy the car for $ XXXXX.  The next day, he sent me back a counter offer and we had a deal.  I asked if he'd hold the car for two days--nothing interferes with hiking--and I assured Joe I was not talking to another dealership.

Today, after selling my old car to CarMax, I walked the mile and a half to the dealership to do the paperwork.  Today I met Chris Aizpitarte who worked with Joe putting the offer together.  Both men are very genial!  For them, the dealership would get 4 stars hands down.

But, then comes the part you can't do online.  I had to go through the process of trying to be sold extended warranties on the car, the tires and wheels, and just about anything else you can think of.  I know these are money makers for the dealers but the sell is really irritating especially when you end up spending too many hours dealing with this.  I wish there was an option you could sign off on saying you don't want that sales pitch and if you get it, the deal's off!  Next time, I'll insist on that.  Perhaps they could send all the options via email and let you return the email with a simple Yes or No to the options.  To me it's such a drag on the whole process, but again, I understand why dealers do this.  I just wanted to get out and drive my car home.

Usually you and your buds drink sake or beer and eat a bunch of small snacks to accompany it.  The best snacks to me are items off of the grilled menu (yakitori) - usually chicken skewers.  When paired with an Asahi superdry, something magical happens.  Does this place serve world class yakitori?  No.  But the fact that there is a place in the Valley to scratch this culinary itch is easily worth 4 stars in my book.   

My rec:  GO!  With coworkers or friends.  Order a japanese beer (preferably Asahi Super Dry).  Order off of the Yakitori menu - try at least one unusual meat - Beef Tongue is incredible.  Say ""Kanpai!"" a lot.  Drink more beer.",2014-10-17 18:20:36

I repeated my phone number 3 times because Mariah couldn't focus to input my phone number correctly. She told me that it wouldn't be a problem to give her my phone number.

Dozen Oysters
French Onion Soup
Beef Wellington for Two
Filet Mignon
The Oysters are always fresh and usually are eaten within minutes with some Merlot wine. The French Onion Soup has a full taste and is a meal in itself. The Beef Wellington, now this is the dish to really try, comes separated from the bones and is so delicious and soft that it melts in your mouth.

They come with cilantro, onions, and a hot sauce that is good, but very spicy (and I like spicy food). You have to pay 75 cents each for extra things like cheese, guac, sour cream, and pico. Personally, I think the cheese and pico should be included, as those are pretty standard. However, the tacos are super cheap - like $1.59 apiece. They each come in two small, soft corn tortillas that are quite good, hold up very well, and are plentifully filled with meat. The bottles of Mexican coke are also great. Love the sweetness.

It's hard for a restaurant to get more popular than this. Even on a weekday night, the restaurant seems almost full. They must be doing something right. After visiting, I think so too. They do take out which might be tempting when they are full. Just remember to get water from somewhere if you can't take spicy food well.

If you do sit down, remember that this isn't really a place for a quiet upscale dinner. The main area is like a school cafeteria. During busy hours, you are almost guaranteed to be sitting next to a stranger, similar to Wrvst. They do have some ""normal"" seating but they are for larger groups. 

Pros:
-Decent value. Around $9 per dish pre-tax. At this price level, you can forget Thai Express! 
-Decent portion! Especially when you consider the price. 
-Fast service. They clearly can consistently manage even full capacity.
-A rewards card. Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!
-Food tastes awesome! Authentic? Maybe I've never been to Thailand but Salad King is good for me! Some Thai places I've tried tasted like Chinese stir fry!

I called the day before, got a noon appointment for the next day, but they asked that I arrive at 11:30AM.  I wondered about that because after all this was not a doctor's appointment where you need time to fill out the paper work.  I arrived at 11:25AM and there were several people (some guests of the hotel) in a line either paying or ordering their services.  A young gentleman came around from behind the desk and asked me to write my name on a roster.  I was called in almost immediately and shown around by a nice young lady who indicated that I could partake of the steam room, sauna, hot tub, etc.  I was not going to be doing that today only my facial.  So basically I sat in a lounge area and waited 30 minutes for my facial.  Could that have been the reason they told me to come in 30 minutes earlier than my appointment?  I certainly could have partaken of the services AFTER the facial so I don't get the wasted 30 minutes.  BTW, there were refreshments such as ice tea, lemonade, etc.  Very nice. Never got my mimosa though.  

I opted for the glycolic acid peel (5%) which involved much more than that.  There was a wonderful treatment of the décolleté as well as an intensive hand treatment which warm creams and heated gloves.  Totally enjoyed that.  The glycolic acid treatment tingled just a tad and it was great.  My facialist was nothing short of amazing and there is no question that I will be back for a more intense glycolic facial. I really liked her.  

When I got home, washed my hair and put on makeup, my skin looked great or at least I thought it did.  Isn't that what counts?

I had a craving for some awesome bbq meat, and this place was right at the top of my list to try and did not disappoint. 

My other half and I came here on Wednesday right after work around 6 and the place was pretty quiet but as we eat our meal it was bustling with take out orders. When you first enter the first thing that hit me was the variety of options. Their menu did take up nearly an entire wall after all. There was plenty of seating which is awesome to see. Bbq, and wings are inherently ""finger food"", and the worse thing is to be rubbing elbows with your friend while trying to put a rib in your mouth. There was plenty of space to spread out, and spread out I did as I eat (so filling!)

Right when we came in we were cheerfully greeted, and was briefly walked through he options of the menu. We ended up getting a platter for 2 as we wanted a good sampling of ""everything"", had 3 sides (mac and cheese, beans and corn bread) as well as an extra side of cheddar jalapeno smoked sausage.

We were informed that it would be a bit of a wait as the pulled pork and pulled beef brisket was going to be freshly prepared, as they don't like to keep those things ""pre made"" through out the day, which I can really appreciate. 

The platter for two was just perfect. It came with pulled pork, pulled and sliced brisket, 1 lb of wings, half rack of ribs and two sides (mac and cheese and beans) and 2 drinks. 

We also got an extra sausage, corn bread and also some plain white thick cut bread.

Let me tell you, my craving for meat was completely and utterly satisfied. 

All the meat was tasty, moist and fall of the bone filled with smoky flavor. The side of carbs perfectly complemented the meat. On the table they also have some in house bbq sauces (hickory, original and honey mustard). Each was pretty much a perfect complement to all the meat. 

What really earned this place a special spot in my books is the absolutely friendly unpretentious service. We were checked in on quite a few times, walked through different options, and the server was kind enough to also give us an extra piece of freshly baked corn bread hot out of the oven! At first the corn bread was a tad lacking in flavor, but the fresh hot one definitely hit the spot! So try and make sure you get your corn bread hot!

I could go on about this place, but will likely run out of space. 

I'm going to just add on a final note that i would absolutely go back without hesitation.

Oh and they also have AYCE from Thurs to Sat from 5 onwards!

I enjoy felafels and have gone around trying them at various restaurants in Arizona. The felafel meat they serve here, is not that bad compared to several other places.  However, I can still tell it came from a box as the waitress confirmed.  And it was too spicy for me.

One of my favorite foods in the world is Tzatziki sauce because it's so cool and soothing with that delicate taste of cucumber.  Today I found out it's the American style Tzatziki sauce I like and not the salty authentic Greek kind because it was, yes you guessed it... too spicy.  Maybe it's the same for the hummus because it had such a zing to it, it burnt my tongue.  It tasted like spicy chunky ketchup with lots of ascorbic acid added to it.  But, hey... this is America.

The first time I came to this restaurant was about three years ago and I left disappointed. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was plain and just not very good. A little less than two years ago, I went to New Orleans and had fantastic food. We went to very good restaurants and had everything from barbecue shrimp to Gouda grits to gumbo and more. It was all absolutely delicious. I loved it. Due to this, I thought... Let's give this restaurant another try. Well... I'm sorry I did. 
Lola's is terrible in comparison to the quality of food that I had in New Orleans. I ordered the shrimp and grits again. Grits should be smooth, not lumpy, and just taste like heaven. The grits at Lola's were lumpy, pasty, and the consistency was that of a dish that was left out for a few hours and has therefore hardened rather than being smooth. The taste is not very good and leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, there is a diner with a few restaurants here in town that makes grits 10 times better than Lola's. The shrimp was plain and I would not order it again. My friend ordered the barbecue shrimp with rice and did not even finish the dish because it was just OK yet she would not order it again nor would she want to come back here again. She was disappointed. We did order the fried okra as a starter and it was not bad but it was not anything to write home about. The best part of our meal was the garlic bread! Pretty sad.
We did not even bother ordering dessert.
Lola's is not a restaurant I would recommend to anyone who asks me about great Louisiana food because I have tasted way better.
The service was OK. It was slow at times.
I know that this restaurant was on DDD's, which I'm not at all impressed by, yet I think that is where a lot of the hype comes in.
I was hoping that after going to New Orleans, where we stayed several days and ate a lot of great food, I would appreciate this restaurant more. It in fact did the opposite. Maybe this is what home cooked meals are supposed to look like, which aren't very good if that is the case, but this is not at all great restaurant quality top-of-the-line New Orleans quality food and I will not be going back.",2017-09-23 23:26:49

They said the soup broth has no msg but the flavour was not intense enough at least for me for the shio ramen.  The noodles were ok.  I prefer the chewier, eggier, curlier version of noodles rather than the wheatier straighter version that goro and gun serve.

Nice presentation and the waiters are nice. Atmosphere is open and modern as a remnant of the old West bar / lounge layout.  I rather prefer the old style intimate Japanese hustle bustle type eateries that are in Vancouver and LA where you crowd around small tables or the cooking area with the boiling vats of soup and noodles however.

Ok in a pinch for a downtown location.  Not as good as the original Shikiji ramen or their current version which is not quite as tasty as the original, but still ok for a noodle fix.",2014-06-01 00:39:52

I go because it's a sportsbar with lots of tvs that's close to my house.  The food would be good if served quickly, but that rarely happens.  In fact, this place would probably get four stars for the food, beer selection & tvs, except that the service is just so rediculously bad, it ruins everything.  EVERYTHING.  Maybe someone from Gallaghers will read this, fire everyone on the wait staff, and then start over. 

I hate people that tell isolated stories about their one experience with shitty service at a restaurant and make it all one sided like they are not ass holes, but I have this great story I gotta tell about this place and yes I hate myself for it so fuck off.  

I got a table with a buddy once outside (we were seated by the hostess) and got passed up by a server for 20 minutes of staring them in the face as they walked by, and then i tried waving my arms around when it appeared one of them was looking in my general direction (which did not work), then my buddy actually got up and snagged one of them, who promised she would be right back.  10 minutes after that I went to the bar & ordered a couple of beers for us.  The bartender acknowledges my beer order and, at that moment, a waitress comes in from outside and tells the bartender that she just doesn't have time for table #xx outside and if he could go get their order that would be great.  So I watch him forget about me and walk out to MY TABLE, talk to my buddy, then walk back in and pour us a couple of beers.  

I decided not to say anything because I was actually laughing at this point. Bartender tries to flag down the waitress to give her the beers to take out to the table, but she kept ignoring HIM!   Yes the bartender was unable to get the waitress' attention after he did her a favor.  So, finally she's in the little computer area behind the bar (I'm still just standing there being entertained), and shes keying in some order from somebody, and the bartender walks over to her and says ""I have your two beers for that outside table"".  She says ""what outside table?""  Bartender: ""The one you asked me to get the order from""  Waitress:  ""Well take the fucking beers out to the table then""  Bartender:  ""But that's your table.  I have other customers at the bar""  Waitress:  ""Then fucking give the beers to somebody at the bar.  Or drink them yourself.  I don't care, I just don't have time for this shit""

This is so great right!   So the bartender just stands there and looks at the waitress, who has her back to him and then, resigned, he walks back behind the bar, picks up the beers and takes them out to our table.  He comes back in, and asks me again what I wanted (because he forgot all about me), and I order a couple more beers because I know that I probably won't get served for the rest of the night.  So now we've got four beers.   Bartender agrees to ""put them on my tab"".

Over the course of the next 30 minutes with zero visits from the waitress, we work our way through those while shooting the shit.   As we're about finished, the waitress actually has the gonads to come up to our table all sweet and nice, and ask us if we'd like anything else.  No.  She puts the tab (for four beers, so she knows or should know that I went in to the bar to get beers at some point) on our table with a little heart on it and then goes into this whole story about how sorry she is and that the bar has just been sooooo busy and it's somebody elses fault bla bla bla bla.  Thank you.  No tip.  In fact I would take money away from you if I could lady.

I also did wait a bit for my food however,  I can tell you it was well worth the wait all around. Initially I wanted to visit Dairy Lane the sister restaurant to Blue Star Diner however, the wait was even longer. BlueStar also has a full Liquor Bar which I don't believe Dairy Lane does. I can't really speak highly enough of the hospitality and service. Alex who greeted me at the door was friendly and warm and welcoming and even offered me a cup of coffee while I wait. I sat at the bar as I'm dining alone and Megan probably took care of me. I decided to have a mimosa they're $5 all the time and you get your choice of OJ ,mango ,and or grapefruit. I decided to go with the mango and it was quite delicious. The coffee is free trade and brewed specifically for the restaurant and really quite good for a more medium-bodied roast. There were many craft specialties of breakfast and brunch favorites. It came down to the Alberta Lamb hash and or the Barbecue Jackfruit and Sweet Potato Hash. As my appetite was as big as I am this morning I decided to go with the Alberta lamb hash. Absolutely delicious! Soft poached egg on top( you can also get it medium), veggies including cucumber , potatoes ,and corned lamb with a side of homemade cornbread made this dish 10 out of 10 Stars.

Came in with the BF and we shared a rice plate and the cha gio eggrolls. 

There's just something a little extra that boost their eggrolls above all the others. It's juicier inside yet still maintains it's crunch. The accompaniments are not overlooked: I havent found a place that gives you a mound of noodles for your rolls. The herbs- they give the standard mint, but there's this heart-ish shaped herb that has a red underbelly that I really like and I haven't found another place here that gives you that with your cha gio (usually it's these long fish smelling herb that I'm not fond of). Then the cucumber is thin spears making it roll ready and the lovely pickled radish carrot. This is where you go if you want a proper cha gio. 

The plate is just as good as the last time so they definitely have a decent standard of consistency in their kitchen. Service is always friendly and the place is pleasant.

The BF swears he will not order broken rice anywhere else because he'll just be disappointed. Pretty big statement, but I totally get it- this place is a spot that is definitely worthy of being in the O.C., which is the place to go in the US for some real Viet gastronomic adventures (actually Bosa has a sister restaurant in Westminster- different name...can't recall right now).

Both nights we ended up seeking refuge at the America Diner at some ungodly hour, much like old travelers of yore would seek refuge at a Tavern to escape the icy snowstorm howling outside.   Except in our case it wasn't howling but it was the incessant sound of clinging coins, and it wasn't a snowstorm but utter mayhem on the Casino floor.   Lastly, it wasn't icy but it was an inconceivable amount of cheap booze that would leave us clutching ourselves in agony the next morning.  While the food pretty much sucked at America, I'm still pretty fucking glad the place was still open at 3 AM on Sunday morning.

While my wife ordered the steak the first night, she opted for the pancakes the second night.   I went with the Macaroni & Cheese and a Spicy Chicken Sandwich the first night and the Macaroni & Cheese and Potato Skins the second night.    (Hey! Nothing like simple carbs to absorb an insane amount of alcohol lounging about in your stomach)

The first night, the Mac & Cheese tasted very much like I what I imagine a Salt Lick tastes like.   The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was anything but.  I'm guessing they ran out of Buffalo sauce and they figured I was too drunk to give a fuck.   While it's true I was too drunk to start an argument then & there, I knew I'd get these fuckers on Yelp sooner or later.    The Mac & Cheese the 2nd night was legit... not great but certainly better than the first night since I could actually glimpse the taste of cheese that time around.   My wife said the steak was completely fucked up and she's still having painful bowel movements some 48 hours later.   The pancakes were good, but then again how does one really fuck up pancakes now, right?

If this was the Bay Area, I'd probably give this place 1 star or 2 at the very most.   Seeing as they're open 24 hours a day though, I'm being generous and giving them 3 stars.

Items are definitely Yorkville priced (maybe 15-18 for cocktails, 10-18 for apps, 15-80+ for mains -- high end being the Wagyu, etc.). This was dinner one of two so we were mainly interested in drinks and a light bite. 

To drink: FLIGHT OF THE REISHI is a vodka/lychee/grapefruit cocktail that is super easy drinking and just when I felt it was like eating asian jello cups, the grapefruit kicked in to ground it a bit. The CAESAR was a shisito-infused vodka base and wasabi rimmed glass. Did not care for the wasabi but the shisito vodka was delicious and made the drink taste like a spicy salsa. Potent but the kick doesn't linger for long. The HAMACHI CRUDO was delicious, served in a supremely well balanced yuzu sauce and topped with crispy carrot threads. The KAMAMESHI super reminded me of a lesser version of my mother's Chinese sticky rice fried rice (you fan). The truffled butter gives a lighter than expected fragrance and the mushroom/burdock root within provide some, but not a whole lot of contrast/interest. The wooden pot itself gives a hint of pleasant smokiness but overall slightly underwhelming considering all the hype -- echoing our overall feel for this place.

Parking was confusing. Apparently you can get parking validated if you park in a specific lot, but there weren't signs or directions to let us know that. We parked across the street next to the Diamondbacks stadium for not an obscene amount of money, but considering we are in Phoenix and not San Francisco, it was excessive. Plus there was some other event going on so we had to drive up several floors and there were annoying cones blocking off most of the available parking. WTF! 

Then we got to the lobby. The line was waaayyyy worse than the MVD. And the lobby is also pure concrete (think bomb shelter), so if you're trying to pull up a Groupon or something on your phone... give up. The cashier was kind enough to pull up our Groupons on her computer. The line was also complete with more than its fair share of impatient, screaming children who needed their naps. 

The actual exhibit was interesting. The only way to get from the ticket counter to the exhibit was a small, slow, in-the-corner elevator. We looked through a few of the permanent exhibits, and it was ok, but nothing special.",2013-05-08 21:12:37

My bf and I sat at the bar so we could see the magic that takes place in the kitchen aka the entertainment of seeing the noodles made. 

Service was prompt and great! Definitely the kind of service that makes you want to give a shout out to the awesome lady who made it worthwhile. I believe our server's name was Sarah and she was working alone but was very helpful, nice, knowledgeable and attentive to every table. She offered water right add we sat which was a plus in my book. Refills were right on time. Btw the water was nice and cold and tasted like it was lemon infused which was super refreshing. 

We decided to get the number one seller, the Shang beef noodles with hand pulled noodles, the chicken sesame cold noodles also with hand pulled noodles, and beef pancakes. 

Everything was delicious. His cold noodles was different from the taste that I was expecting. It first reminded me of peanut butter sauce but was not too sweet and was a bit on the bitter side and spicy but not too spicy. My bf said that that particular dish is more of an acquired taste but he said they made it right and enjoyed it. 

The beef pancakes came out hot and crispy and juicy! They cane out after our noodle dishes but Sarah let us know they'd be right out abd took a little longer to cook which was no problem. 

And the Shang beef noodles really were to die for. The moment I tasted the broth I was hooked. It wasn't too salty, none of that msg after taste and surprisingly was not oily! I would get this over ramen any day lol the bf agreed that it was one of the best he's had in a long long time. The cut of beef used was perfect and tender with the right amount of fat. 

Now the noodles are what made the dishes great! In the Shang beef, they didn't get soggy once throughout the meal! That was one thing I did not like about eating a dish with noodles in a broth but the noodles here retained their chewiness and texture and did not bloat! I appreciated that they weren't uniform either; some were a little thicker or thinner than others but it made the dish feel even more homey.

The owner Sam is a bright, young man and we were able to chat with him for a while. Thank you for bringing Shang Artisan Noodles to Vegas! This is place worth going to again and again.",2016-11-24 01:47:29

Amazing price for the quality, amount of tippings and size, and nice lunch set meal at a great deal...that is, if you do not come in a group. A bit peeved because their group gratuity is a bit steep at 18% (really 20% because it's off of price with tax, and the server solely took our orders and gave us our food) and they will only split the bill max 2 ways. 

Anyways let's concentrate on the food, which is very good and definitely worth your visit! 
They have a lunch set meal Monday-Thurs (11:30-4:00) for $12.75 meat options or $12.90 veggie options, which includes a choice of 4 ramens, plus a side dish and pop/tea. I ordered the 1) Garlic Shoyu Ramen, 2) Deep fried pork gyoza and 3) Coca Cola. 
Their ramen noodles are cooked perfectly and unlike many shops in Toronto, their soup base is perfectly seasoned and not overly salted! It also comes with a lot of toppings which you would have to pay $2 for each at other place, but here it's part of the bowl: bamboo, green onion, nori, half a soft-boiled egg. Gyoza were nicely fried, not super porky in flavour and average.

The restaurant is decked out in nice rustic Italian fashion with dim lighting and white table cloths. My party and I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than our reservation slot, but we were seated immediately anyway.

As per the norm of most Italian restaurants, warm bread was brought to the table in a basket covered with a napkin. Brought along with the fresh bread was a ramekin filled with a delicious concoction of what I believed to be olive oil, a bit of roasted garlic, and perhaps a hint of pesto. For appetizers we went with the calamari fritti (fried calamari) which was adorned with a lemon and marinara topped with red pepper flakes. Overall the calamari was mediocre, in my opinion.

For my entree I went for the Bucatini Corti all'Amatriciana. A $24 plate of thick, but hollow bucatini noodles topped with Italian bacon, onions, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. I've had variations of this dish in the past but this particular one did not rank up near the top with the others. Don't get me wrong, I knew exactly what I was getting into with my order however for the price I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately, I was not. I am making a general assumption in that the dish prices are predicated upon the restaurant's proximity to the strip, and I am certain the cost of the bacon is something to take note of.

The waitstaff certainly deserved 5 stars. Friendliness, knowledge of the menu, and attentiveness were definitely their strong suits that evening.

We stood around for a while in the bar area, and nobody offered us a menu or directed us to go order at the vintage trailer that serves as the kitchen.  I find the tables in the bar area to be completely uncomfortable (too high, awkward to get into, especially if you're wearing a dress, and there's nothing against which to lean).  But, if it's too cold to sit on the patio, those awful tables are pretty much your only option.  However, the food is fantastic.  I've never been disappointed.

My first impressions of the restaurant were excellent. We had made a reservation via OpenTable, and upon arriving for our 7:30 reservation at 7:25PM, the hostess took one glance at her terminal after asking my name and said, ""Your table is waiting, follow me."" That's what I want to hear.

Once we were sat, however, it was a full 10 minutes before our server came to our table. After such a prompt seating by a hostess who conveyed gravitas and professionalism (she wasn't some college kid, which impressed me greatly) I was expecting promptness and seasoned professionalism throughout the place. 

Our waiter finally showed up, and didn't ask if we wanted to know the specials, or have any information for us. Instead, when I asked him about the beers on draft, he informed me that no beers were on draft (which is fine) and disappeared for another five minutes to get us a beer menu. 

He placed it with us, then left again, then returned to ask us if we had decided on drinks. We had, so we ordered them, and again he was off - with no inquiry about if we had any questions on the menu, and no offer to take our order. Yeah, I was hungry. Got a problem with that?

We finally got bread, and water, which I had trouble getting refilled. I also drink a lot, and drink fast (which yes, caused me problems in my college days). I found that water-filling staff members would  come and fill the water glasses of the newly-seated tables around us, without a single look at my empty water glass. Finally, I stopped one woman going to the table next to me and asked with my eyes and a nudge if she could spare some more water. 

Our orders were eventually placed and the food was good - very good. But the portions were small. The three stars are for the food, to be sure. My husband ordered the lamb chop special, which he very much enjoyed. He particularly enjoyed the mint sauce that came with it.

I ordered the hangar steak, cooked medium, and the pan fried corn. I received hangar steak, cooked rare. Fortunately, I can enjoy steak cooked along the spectrum from rare to medium well, so I didn't send it back. Besides, I had waited long enough for my food, I wasn't about to let my server take it back so he could have them re-cook it and risk the spit. So yeah, when he checked in I smiled broadly and said, ""Everything is great!"" as I ate my steak that mooed. The corn was good, but nothing I couldn't easily recreate in a cast iron skillet at home with a few ears of fresh corn and some butter.

This restaurant visit was a part of our ""date night"" so my husband and I enjoyed  the evening. The next day, my husband confessed to me that he was expecting more from a ""wood-fired kitchen"" - like, stuff that actually tasted like it had been cooked over a wood fire. Neither of our entrees had any smokiness to them. He had been itching to go to Firebirds, but we chose Rooster's instead because it was ""new"". Firebirds delivered more on the smoke when we last visited there.

We likely won't be going back to Rooster's for date-night in the future. The food was okay, but didn't wow me. The ambiance was ""meh"". The gem of the night was that fantastic professional hostess. I wish Noble could channel that excellence into the rest of the experience at Roosters.",2012-03-06 00:00:33

Probably one of the better AYCE sushi joints in Mississauga, although the only other good one I can think of is Prince.   All other AYCE joints are pretty much meh.  I would have put the Spring Rolls by Square One as a good joint, but it's no longer AYCE.

I liked everything here except for the sushi itself.  While the fish was fresh, I thought there was way too much rice.  However, we also got the spicy salmon crispy roll and the rainbow roll, which was delicious.  Also, strange that they have no seaweed salad.

Full order:
Miso soup
Agedashi (cold tofu)
Spicy Salmon Crispy Roll
Grilled Squid/Calamari
Chicken Karage
Fish Roe, Tuna and Salmon Rose Sushi
Sole Fish Fillet
Spicy Beef Udon soup
Curry Chicken Don
Grilled Salmon Belly
Rainbow roll

I would say that the hot food and apps get 4/5 and the sushi itself gets 3.5/5.  While service was prompt and dishes came out quickly, there were a few strange things that I didn't like:

-you have to ask for plates when you do AYCE, which is kind of weird considering that we aren't going to eat straight from the serving dish
-ginger wasn't served with the wasabi, so had to ask for it
-10% tip added on automatically (even for 2 people)

So while I think this place has decent decor, decent food, it's got some little quirks that would prevent me from being an every month customer - maybe once every 2-3 months.  Also, lunch price is a bit more expensive than normal - $14.99.",2013-11-15 21:24:56

CocumCuel9cvrutv2gdCoA,7_RaCe5zzPBYWm9znlffUA,fJ-2acaqvWOsujUTAJB-ew,4,2,1,1,"While I am not a ramen connoisseur, Raijin Ramen was recommended by my friend's Japanese Registered Massage Therapist/Acupuncturist, as the best ramen in the neighborhood. 

Slurping loudly is one of pleasures of indulging in ramen! It is a sign of respect for the chef's hard work and dedication. 

I ordered the Dark Miso Ramen ($9.95).  Unfortunately, it did not induce as much slurping as I had hoped.It was saltier than I would have preferred. While the chicken broth was not as creamy as it's rich tonkotsu counterpart, a hint of smoky bamboo flavour did came through. The chicken cha-shu was juicy and tender.

Kara-age ($4.30) was decent. It was piping hot. Perhaps it is the potato starch to flour ratio, it was not as crisp as other restaurants. 

Raijin Ramen earned some respect after I sampled my friend's Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen ($12.25). It was very slurp-able. The broth was rich, smokey, and creamy. No wonder it is the #1 best seller at Raijin. My friend ignored the advice from her acupuncturist and puts her life at risk (grossly exaggerated) by ordering spicy ramen when she was cough excessively. Judging from the satisfying look on her face, it was well worth it. 

Who can blame her? Salty-spicy goodness with sweetness from the corn to balance the savoriness of the broth - slurp away! Any food lover would have done the same! I will be back for the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen!",2016-09-08 14:51:38

He thinks it shows character to not compromise your own beliefs to make money. I think it shows common sense to allow me to exchange my money for your chicken any time I damn well please. So we agree to disagree.

Chick Fil A is definitely up there with Chipotle and In & Out as a top tier ""Fast Food"" place. Their chicken is juicy and tender and delicious and they come with tons of pickles, which I love. My similarities to Snookie end there. They also give you a bunch of different sauce options, so when you get a really good sandwich, you feel like you can kind of take some of the credit because you chose the sauce. I am all about heaping undeserved praise on myself, so this really helps with that. Okay, my similarities to Snookie end THERE.

Their fountain drink machine has both Coke Zero AND Diet Dr Pepper as zero calorie options, which is fantastic. I wish all places would start offering more diet options in their fountain machine. I mean, seriously, who drinks real soda? Besides, maybe, during a hangover? I just cannot fathom consuming 240 empty calories just so my Coke has real corn syrup in it. Actually, all places just need to just get those touch screen coke machines, including this Chick Fil A, if they haven't (which I'm not sure because I've only used the drive through).

Finally, the employees are all SUPER nice. At first I thought it was a fluke, and I just happened to get a ridiculously pleasant drive through attendant, but they've all been like that so it must be part of their training or something. Or maybe my Dad is right, and they're just in a good mood because they have Sundays off.",2011-07-07 20:17:02

I had blood orange mojito to start off which was pretty but was ok, not worth $15 ! I would have ordered wine instead. The appy I ordered grilled calamari and they were yummy chewy and good portioned. 4-5 sizable calamaris. Definitely a good plate to share. The main of course I had to have black cod that everyone is raving about. I sat facing the kitchen and every time I see a black cod shone under the red light (meaning it's ready to be delivered to the table) I hoped that it was for me.

It's true. and it just glides over your tongue with its flavour.. I forgot what was on the bottom it was some sort of a puree that went with the cod. But I tell you you must try the cod..

Fast forward to this past weekend, it was our mission to eat here so we arrived at 4:40pm and the line was at full capacity, gee whiz!  Overall, our wait time from getting in line to getting seated  was a good 1.5 hours.

First off, the setup of the buffet is odd.  Yes, it's literally the shape of a ""B"" without the vertical line so, it was quite curvaceous.  Also, the main thoroughfare into the resto merged with the buffet line so there were a lot of people bumping into each other.  I will say however I was impressed.  With as long as the buffet was, there were not any duplicated offerings!

As far as food quality and selections, for a Vegas casino (Yes, I know it's technically in Henderson) it was decent.  They featured your standard buffet offerings such as Asian, Seafood, American, Italian, etc.  However, they had a few items that were unique, such as the Thai Beef Salad, Panang Beef which was spicy but delicious, Kalbi Short Ribs and Seafood Salad among a few other things.  I like how they also offered cold Crab and steamed Crab.  I didn't try the steamed Crab because the cold Crab I had was just too salty and wasn't craving anymore.  Also, I'm always hesitant about buffet Prime Rib but their Prime Rib was actually really good, just a few steps shy of steakhouse quality, in my opinion.

My favorite station overall was the Dessert station.  Granted the line for dessert was redonkulous, it was cool because it insured no one would just cut in and out.  They had your standard fare of desserts along with crepes and gelato.  I loved that they had a made to order Espresso station at the end.

Our server however was less than satisfactory.  I couldn't figure it out.  I observed the other servers in our area and they were stellar, bussing plates that were a foot high on a tray they'd carry above their shoulders, keep beves full and we get stuck with the ho hum server that would barely take our few dirty plates, much less, give us refills.  I wanted to leave him a dollar but the s/o felt bad.  Really?  The server was bad is more like it.

Overall, would I come here again?  The food was okay but it wasn't worth that horrendous wait.  As for the 5-star reviews well keep in mind, beer and wine are included in the buffet so, 'nuff said.  ""Best buffet in Vegas..."" y'all are trippin!!!  : /",2011-04-29 04:24:11

While I have never had the opportunity to work my way through each rack and display case (but would like to someday!), I have found my favorite brand of jeans (7 for All Mankind) a couple of times at what I think is a great price.  I have brought in items to consign as well.  Once you establish an account, the process is fairly quick and easy.  I don't dwell on which items sell, or the price, since I would have otherwise donated the clothing.  Any store credit received is a fun bonus to me!

One piece of advice - try on everything - even if the label says it is your size, and it is a brand you are familiar with.  Jeans, especially the designer brands, have many times been altered by the previous owner for waist size or length (and all sales are final).

While it's true nobody else cries or dies, I cry a little from the attitude the servers all provide.  If I didn't know any better, I'd think they were getting trained to do a little turn on the catwalk, yeah on the cat walk, but seriously they're not sexy enough to be right, said Fred.

We were seated promptly and greeted right away. We started with an order of monkey break and a few cocktails. the monkey break is very sweet but super tasty. I ordered the chorizo and eggs which come with Schreiner's chorizo in link form, which was new for me but enjoyable. My fiance ordered the chicken and waffles, which is not on their online menu but is worth asking about. The chicken was glazed in almost like an Asian sauce and was very moist, he really enjoyed it. Our friends ordered the notorious big burger and biscuits and gravy. We found the biscuits to be very dry but the chorizo gravy was very good. My friend did not enjoy the big burger as much and found it to be very messy. Based on the service and location I think we will be back to explore more of their menu.

The location is small and actually located in a house, but has seating inside and outside on a deck.  The parking is in the back with about 5-6 spots available for cars.  We arrived with out a reservation, but were seated almost immediately on a Sunday night during Restaurant Week.  They had a great selection of cocktails, local beers, and significant wine list. 

We ordered a few appetizers.  The fried tofu dish was ok...kind of smooshy in a soy sauce...didn't really care for it.  The seaweed salad was excellent, with marinated seaweed over shiitake mushrooms.  The spring roll was also well put together with dipping sauces. 

We absolutely loved the Veggie and Spicy Veggie buns.  The buns were perfectly cooked with an incredible sauce on the inside that almost makes my mouth water thinking about it.  The spicy wasn't really all that spicy, but taste SOOOOO good.  The combination of the soft bread, cucumbers, and fried tofu...amazing.  The veggie dumplings were also well done with the crispy crust and  chewy top.  Also filled with a nice assortment of diced vegs and tofu.

The Veggie Ramen was good.  I am not a huge fan of Ramen, but the addition of the spice bomb, and garlic bomb was excellent.  The smoked tofu and noodles were cooked well, and the soup surrounding it was flavorful.  We also tried the mango ice cream Mochi which was o.k.

Overall this is a great noodle shop in Madison.  What I really loved was the attentive service.  Our waiter was getting killed with it being restaurant week and the place being packed, but he NEVER let our water glasses get empty.  He brought the food out in a perfectly timed method that allowed us to enjoy each dish.  Just plain excellent service.",2015-07-20 16:12:56

The first time we came here for lunch and the place was still closed even though they said they would be open at 1130 and it was already noon, so that was not a good first impression. We decided to give it another chance and we had dinner there, keep in mind, only 1 groupon per table. At first the waiter seemed kind of rude, I think he was annoyed that we had a groupon and we had thought we could use two of them, or maybe it is just an Italian thing, he just kind of gave us a negative vibe at first, but you know am not one to make this experience a bad one so I gave him a second chance as well. He did get a lot nicer as the meal progressed. Upon his recommendations, we had the spaghetti & meatballs as well as the homemade finger pasta with Italian sausage. The pasta was delicious and still al dente, but if i were to pay full price for it, uhmmm i would have second thoughts. The other yelpers were raving about the tiramisu so I tried it, it did NOT IMPRESS me though, I thought it was plain and the Tiramisu you can buy at Smith's tasted better. I guess this is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant, but I think the ambience is not that upscale. If you are planning to celebrate a special occasion here, I would not recommend it if you are wanting it to be fancy and special, but if you just wanna try their pasta I would say go for it.

Apparently, you're not allowed to block the entrance or ask for change or ask to use the washroom - the hand written signs say so! Curious to see what kind of food this had to offer so we tried the beef brisket sandwich special ($10.99 with fries and drink) and their bacon cheddar burger ($5.80?) 

This place is cheeeap. And in the good way! Humble, diner food at reasonable prices. The lady at the counter could have been more friendly, but she got my order quick and correct. Food took about 15 minutes to prepare for take-out.

The burger was huge and the patty was definitely homemade since it was crumbling out of my bun. You had to eat this burger with two hands. It could have used more seasoning and sauce but not bad for $5.00. 

The beef brisket sandwich was delicious. Melt in the mouth beef, smothered in homemade BBQ sauce. It was really good and to have a complete combo meal for only $10.99, I can dig it.

However, the staff was super friendly, the ingredients look great, the pizza was very tasty and... to top it off, the flavored unsweetened tea was awesome as well. ( They had Black tea, passionfruit, and jasmine/blackberry tea).

The pizza crust was very thin and crispy and it cooks really fast. The setup us modern, the music is upbeat, and the prices are very reasonable. Daughter had a steak salad and the portion was big, and the said it was very tasty. My friend had the Hawaiian, hubby had the Italian meats or something like that, and I went crazy with a custom one.

Instead, I endured rudeness and verbal abuse and in a follow up call to the OWNER, complete lack of empathy and a general cockiness that was such an incredible turn off I will never cross their path again!
     The cupcakes themselves are sub-par, too much frosting and not enough taste. Showboy Cupcakes in Anthem are a superior product, and even cupcakery on Eastern has a better prodect and much nicer staff.
     I walked into GiGi's before work last Saturday with an old Groupon I was eager to redeem (for its value) and to purchase additional cupcakes for a friends birthday. I waited up front for approx 6 minutes. I called into the back, I opened and closed the front door to make the door ding, I leaned over counter and hollared at the girls I saw working in the back. Finally one came up and with complete nonchalance was like "" why didnt you ring the bell?"" What bell, the one with the sign that says ring for service, what bell, what sign? She points at a small bell taped to the other side of the service counter, with no sign. ""Oh... the sign must have torn off. oh well."" We then went back and forth about being able to use the value of the groupon, even tho the explanation was written right on top. I asked for 6 cupcakes, she put the first 3 I chose into a box for 4, I said I asked for 6, back and forth some more. Finally I was like fine, just give me a 4th one. She grabbed the red velvet roughly- leaving a FINGERPRINT in the frosting and stuffed it into the box. I asked to see a manager, again with manager went back and forth. I ended up leaving with the 4 cupcakes and had to dump the one with a FINGERPRINT in the frosting in the garbage!!!!
      I called a few days later and spoke to the OWNER. During our 10 minute conversation I never got a single apology about the situation I had to endure, I got excuses about new employees and I got numbers thrown at me about how much the shop makes and how many hotels use them and how great they are. Never once did the owner offer a solution to the situation or an apology. Over and over he talked about how great their shop was and how everyone in Vegas loves them.  I actually ended up hanging up on the owner during his 2nd or 3rd time telling me about how successful their business is and how wonderful their cupcakes are. HOWEVER- IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR REVIEWS....they are FAR from 5-star, so obviously not everyone loves them. And now I am another who does not love them.      
        If you want an average cupcake and a sub-par experience in their shop choosing your flavors...a possible finger in your product and rude owners telling you how great they are and that their new employees just need more experience...enjoy GiGi's....otherwise, I highly reccomend ANY of their competitors for a better cupcake and a SUPERIER EXPERIENCE!",2013-06-01 15:15:22

We stopped in to get some food as we were hungry and ordered some wings and I wanted the Prime Rib special which they were out of but said they had a ribeye as a substitute for the same price.

As for the wings, if you like EXTREMELY breaded and almost over fried wings you will love these.   We ordered the garlic parmesan and they were just a breaded mess.  There was no garlic taste, the kitchen was very stingy on the parmesan.  They really tasted like a breaded mess with no garlic and very little parmesan.

As for the ribeye, the quality was VERY VERY poor, it was over cooked and there was NO tenderness at all.  A good ribeye was fatty and juicy, this was a dry, overcooked tuff tasting piece of meat.  I guess for being a sports bar type place, the quality of the food they get is not of a high priority.  

I guess when people mostly young crowd are there to drink, they don't care about quality and this place definitely supports their lack of desire for quality.

This is a place we WILL NOT be back too.  It is very sad to write a bad review, but they unfortunately earned it.....Oh and on the wings, they do offer grilled versus breaded, but don't expect the server to share that information with you at the time of your order.

Service was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.  

I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).  I also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea, so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of Twinings.

The first was for the Captain's Dinner Dance cruies on Valentine's Day.  When you make your reservation, make a request if you want to be seated in a specific area, especially if you want window seating or to be seated on the main floor.  

I wasn't sure what to expect other than standard banquet fare and some dance music.  The cruise exceeded my expectations.  They were very efficient on getting passengers on board even though they herd you into a line so they can take your picture as you board the ship.  You were able to board about an hour before departure and enjoy a la carte drinks and appetizers.  Skip the appetizers and eat something before you get on or just save room for dinner.  Drinks were on the expensive side but that is to be expected at this type of event.  There were several speciality drinks that come in a souvenier cup.  Your second drink will be cheaper because you won't be paying for the glass again.  

As the boat pulled away from the docks, we were treated to a brief narration about hilights in Pittsburgh's skyline.  It was informative enough to give you a taste of information but not so intrusive that it was annoying.  Despite a fully packed boat, tables were escorted to the buffet quickly and efficiently and the food supply was constantly replenished.  Despite my thoughts that it would be standard banquet food, everything was actually quite tasty.  When the buffets were removed, the dancing started.  There was a live ""band"" that had guitar, keyboards and a singer (backed up by tracks of music).  Their quality of playing wasn't the best, but I'm a music snob so I let it slide so I could kick back nad have a good time.  They played a variety of music ranging over the decades but seemed to mostly focus on disco.  I would have preferred there to be more slow cances considering it was Valentine's Day, but we had a great time dancing.  Before we knew it, the boat was pulling back in to Station Square and a fun night came to a close.

The second time I took the Gateway Clipper was for the shuttle to a Pirates game.  The service was efficient and drops you off right at PNC Park.  My only complaint is that we just missed getting on to one of hte smaller ships so we had to wait until the larger one was at capacity before they shuttled us to PNC which ended up making us late for the start of the game.  If you plan on taking the shuttle, make sure you give yourself enough time.",2012-06-28 21:02:59

When you walk in, Bar North has a good sophisticated feel to it and I really liked the open air feel.    We initially started out sitting at the bar while we hawked a table outside to open up. Personally I think the drink choices are incredibly lacking for a place with the word ""Bar"" in its name. There were only 5 or 6 beer choices and the wine list was pretty meager as well.  A person next to us asked if they had Red Bull and they didn't...again as a ""bar"" even an upscale one at that, I was a bit surprised they didn't have Red Bull.   The two desserts that our group tried during the evening weren't very good at all...the cannolis were disgusting, but thankfully were only $4. The hazelnut cake did not get good reviews either from those in our group that tried it.

I could have gotten over a lackluster drink selection and disappointing desserts if the service had been awesome.  However, service, to be frank, sucks.  The girl behind the bar was awful (not friendly at all...it seemed like we were inconveniencing her) and when I tried to close our tab because we were moving outside, it took forever to finally get someone's attention.  Once we moved outside and had a waiter, it didn't get better.  He clearly walked by a few times and never asked how we were doing and if we wanted/needed more drinks. Once we got the bill, he never came and picked it up, so Kristin S. had to take it inside to the bar to pay.

To top the whole night off, the outside of Bar North faces the fountains. So we were treated to children screaming and running through the fountains at 10 pm. Later we saw one child sitting at a table in Bar North eating dessert...at like 10:30 pm. Awesome.",2008-05-12 16:39:32

Besides one MINOR things thing that was not perfect, our buttermilk fried chicken was a bit over cooked, everything else was spot on delish!

We had several apps to share - 
Mac & Cheese -OMG-YUMMERS!!!, 
Shishito Peppers -a bit too spicy for us, which was surprising because they are rarely hot. Maybe because we are late in the Shishito Pepper season?
and Alote Corn- Which was so, so good! 

Dinners were a success. I especially liked the gnocchi! And the Buttermilk Chicken sandwich is always a hit!

Save room for dessert!! We ordered the apple pie, and a toffee crunch pudding.
The pie was delicious in a super classic, can't go wring kind of way. I say that with love and respect!!

The welcome is a bit rude, as in the waitress just snubbed us.  I was feeling that if we don't get a table soon I may as well go to Ding Tai Fung as the fallback.

Eventually we did get a seat.

I got the Beef Noodle soup with no fixins small size for $5.99.  The amount of food was sufficient for my girth.  

The beef chunks were yummy, but a little tough if you have trouble chewing, though that didn't stop me since it does taste good.  Just had to use my hand to push up my jaw.  

The noodles were perfect for this type of dish.  A little chewy and al dente at the same time.  Feels hand made.

The soup was excellent, not too salty and I drank it all the way down like a ramen bowl.  I didn't care that I was in a Chinese restaurant it was that good.

The restaurant had three waiting staff, but they were very uncoordinated.  The tea refills didn't come right away.  So just because the service and welcome impression was bad, I deducted three stars.  However, the food was worth six stars because of the quality and price.

I came during restaurant week so the menu came priced at $30 with options from starter, entree, and dessert sections.  The choices were kale salad and salmon bites to start, brunch club sandwich, pancakes, and prime rib hash for entrees, and cookies and milk or donuts for dessert.  We decided to try as much as possible so we each ordered differently, excluding the pancakes.

We began with a complimentary champagne and the bread basket that came with an icing dipping sauce.  Unique bread offering, especially giving it a dessert feel to begin and end the meal.  The portions are enormous at every stage of the morning.  The kale salad was easily a meal on its own and as good as it gets.  The smoked salmon crackers with cream cheese had a full fish with the amount of lox they plated.  And these were just the starters.

The club sandwich came with plantain-like sweet potato fries and four double decker cuts.  The avocado was a great addition to this dish.  The prime rib hash came with a couple of poached eggs and some hash browns underneath with a nice sauce.  Out of those two, I would recommend the hash, especially since STK is still the Cosmo go to steak house, brunch or not.  But both are great options and enough to take home for a meal later in the day for sure.

The dessert - just plain ridiculous.  The donuts come 6 to a plate and are just well made, fresh offerings.  The milk and cookies (get this dessert!) comes with a medium sized vanilla milkshake (one of the best I've ever tasted), and 10 cookies.  Ours included gingerbread, chocolate chip, and powdered.  I believe it is based on chef's choice though.  Their dessert game is spot on from the opening bread to the ending platter.  I usually don't order dessert at restaurants, but I am really glad I came during restaurant week to experience this treat.

The atmosphere in the restaurant itself is very clubby with an active DJ during the 11am-2pm brunch time.  It didn't seem like a too crowded restaurant for brunch (maybe Eggslut's opening was taking some buzz) but it really should be.  I will most definitely be back to try other brunch offerings or for dinner to stuff my face once again.  It's not your typical high end, classy joint ambiance-wise (prices are on par, however), but still a fantastic meal.  Portions unbelievable and definitely a sweeter alternative for brunch in town.",2016-06-13 03:52:01

My drink is pretty simple, just iced coffee with coconut milk & syrup. I like black coffee, coffee with just syrup, coffee with just milk, pretty much any way. I am not picky at all. However, my coffee always ends up tasting awful from here. I know Starbucks has coffee that falls on the more bitter side, but my coffee always tastes sour and gross. 

We have always gone here just because it's the closest one to us and the staff are friendly and don't ever get upset when we have to get our drinks remade.

The gyro-meat shawarma fries with tzatziki sauce were salty and delicious.  The bed of fries were sprinkled with Mediterranean-style seasonings, although as mentioned above they were a bit too salty.  Nevertheless, the fries were cooked perfectly and became a great base for this dish.  I chose the gyro meat (over beef or chicken) and it was a great choice...tender, seasoned nicely and fresh of the spit.  Covering all of this was a generous portion of tangy, bitey, garlicky tzatziki sauce.  This was the equivalent of Greek nachos and they went down easy. ;-)

M's Fish dinner had to be sent back because it was just not that good and incredibly salty. They did make him another one which came out much better.
It was not the worst fish I have ever had, but not the best either. 
Maybe because, it is Phoenix and I am comparing it with other cities.
But, sad to say I am not a fan. However, the corn was really good. I am not a corn eater normally, but it was cut fresh off the corn and was really good.

The reason I am giving 5 stars is the dessert.
It was such good Key lime Pie! I mean really good. They say they make it right there in the restaurant! It tasted just like what I had in The Keys!
Who would ever think that you would go for fish and love the dessert instead, but it happened.
This is a place I would go to in the future for dessert for sure, the seafood is better than Red Lobster, but that is not saying much. Because, I cannot say I would ever go to a Red Lobster ever again. I might go back here though. Maybe we just need to give it another try.

It's a really nice theater, as most everyone has said it's small enough to feel intimate but not so small it's uncomfortable.  The theater is situated right in the middle of the action, skipping distance from Arizona Center, Phoenix Convention Center and Cityscape...not to mention hotels and restaurants in walking distance.  It makes for a great night out at the theater!

I've had the pleasure of being on both sides of the curtain here, and both experiences were great.  From the audience's perspective, the seats are comfortable with good views of the stage, the lobby is large enough to mingle in, and the concessions flow, if you'd like a beverage while you watch the show.  Backstage is a whole different experience, but equally enjoyable.  There are plenty of dressing rooms, courteous and professional staff, and plenty of room to get from place to place without being seen.

I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage pattie. Menu says 3 eggs, though the serving looked more like 2. Hash browns were tasty, but not as crispy as iike them, and the sausage was alright.

Although i have to agree with the other reviewer that the hallways at the upper levels DO SMELL OF WET MOP MILDEW... that WAS unpleasant.. i did read the reviews before i booked my stay and read that but didn't take it literally, when i smelled it myself, i just had to laugh cause that review was ENTIRELY TRUE.

THE BEDS were clean, not too many throw pillows (cleaner) cause you know they don't clean those after its been all over the floor..


a negative was the lack of towels and toilet paper, only about 2 body towels and 2 face towels.. Only one roll of 80% used toilet paper, had to grab one when i saw the cleaning staff's rolling rack of stuff!

And I don't know about everyone else, but when this store opened it was a very happy day for me, as they offer a really nice snacking alternative compared to the other things available in the area.

Know before you walk in there that the Oakland branch of the local Pittsburgh Popcorn Co. is small - there's a counter, carnival-themed posters and decorations, a popcorn maker and bins of fresh and flavored popcorn. That's it. There's no sitting room - people just walk in, get their popcorn and go here. Not surprising given the part of town they're in and the food they're selling, admittedly.

Worried that you won't know what you want? Don't fret: there are free samples so people can taste and pick their favorite from nine or ten gourmet popcorn flavors, which rotate and change from week to week. Popular flavors that I've seen include cheddar, chocolate, kettle, peanut butter and s'mores, as well as a Flavor of the Week. I personally am a big fan of the peanut butter and chocolate popcorn (surprised?), but have never been disappointed by what I've tasted.

I've admittedly noticed that while the company strives to make its popcorn fresh, the bags I've bought have varied in flavor and freshness. I'm not sure why this happens, but still, a bag of popcorn from this store is usually absolutely delicious, and often enough to keep me fed most of the day. (Why yes I did graduate recently, how can you tell?) I definitely recommend stopping in here to grab a bag of popcorn when you can - it's delicious and easily transportable, so it's win-win!",2012-10-15 21:46:32

So when I finally dragged a group out here to Monroeville to try some South Indian cuisine for the first time, I was excited see what the hype was all about.

Between the 5 of us, we tried the PAPER MASALA DOSA, a PANEER DOSA, an ONION & PEAS UTHAPPAM, a VEGETABLE UTHAPPAM, a SOUTH INDIAN THALI, a plain BHATURA, and a round of MASALA CHAIS and COFFEE.  Udipi's strength clearly lies in its carbier offerings, as the dosas, uthappams, and bhaturas were enjoyed by all, with the SAMBHAR and COCONUT CHUTNEY as flavorful accompaniments.  Some crispy dough, some creamy filling, plus a savory sweet dip make for a perfect bite.  The paneer filling didn't sing like I would have hoped--the flavor fell flat and it was a strange texture that was more mushy than anything else, but wrapped inside its dosa shell, it was perfect tasty anyway.

The thali was the biggest miss for me.  I honestly couldn't assign every dish to its name, but the only ones I really enjoyed were the RASAM and a sticky rice garnished with dried fruit.  The rasam was so wonderfully spiced and aromatic, I committed to another side order, and the sticky rice was toothsome and fragrant.  The PORIYAL was tasty enough, as was the ubiquitious SAMBHAR, but I mostly left the rest of the savory dishes and the PICKLES, as well as the PAYASAM, which I had been excited to try as I love milky desserts, but just didn't care for the flavoring of.  I like soft breads, so the CHAPATI and the PAPADUM just weren't my thing, and Udipi's versions were no exceptions.

The chais tasted sinfully creamy, almost too much so to sip, and my tiny cup was gone in minutes.  It would be great if they would offer refills, as the cups are so small for their price.  I enjoyed the creamy coffee as well, though it was a bit too indulgent for my black coffee-loving husband.

In total, our Saturday lunch was an adventurous and flavorful meal and well worth the trek as first-timers, though I ultimately much prefer the aloo gobis and korma dishes that I find much more satisfying.  I wish I had ordered a quart of the rasam to go, as I likely won't be back.",2017-01-15 23:05:30

The tapas were tasty and the service was attentive but I wasn't left with an overwhelming sense of desire to come back. 

We were staying at Aria and wanted a bite but without reservations there was a wait so we grabbed seats at the the bar. 

The stuffed dates lacked the little crunch you expect with cooked bacon. The meat seemed a little under done.

The ribeye was a disappointment. It wasn't served warm, it was served with four slices of overwhelmingly fatty pieces of meat. The potatoes it's served with were delicious. 

The pan manchengo was simple enough, toast with garlic tomato spread and slices of cheese. The price seemed like a stretch for such a simple dish. 

The churros and spicy Mexican chocolate sauce were enjoyable but the churros seemed overcooked. They had a snap like a chip and not like your usual churro with a softer center. The sauce was drinkable though. Absolutely perfect with deeps of rich chocolate and just a small about of heat.

So far, Bellwoods is the clear winner for best microbrewed beer in Toronto.  They have a great mix of styles, flavors, and traditional/experimental beers on tap.  I like that they do 4 oz tasters for $3 and full pours are in the $6.50-$8.50 range, which is reasonable for high-quality and often high-alcohol beers.  

I'm a particular fan of Grandma's Boy, a Belgian trippel that's been barrel aged for 6 months.  Wow, outstanding citrus flavors combine with wild yeast complexities.  Their IPA's are almost close to my ideal, one step back from the California style of adding as many hops as they can possibly fit in the kettle.  One or two beers weren't totally my style, but were still good. Their saison was a very interesting beer, for example, but completely different from the style that I was expecting for a farmhouse saison, much drier and more vegetal.

The food offers a nice mix of meat and vegetarian options.  The housemade sausage was quite good.  I also love that they know what an heirloom vegetable is!  I could take no issue with their (pickled) vegetables and their lovely acorn squash with grits and celery root.  Prices are reasonable and the taste is good.  It's even more amazing when you walk by and see how tiny the kitchen is.

The servers are friendly and quite knowledgeable about their beer.  I mean they're on the hipster side, but what else do you expect from a trendy microbrewery on Ossington?  I found that the tall guy had better beer recommendations than the hipster waitress with the neck piercing (can I say ouch!).    

The main problem: this is a small restaurant.  The outdoor patio is lovely and in the fall has nice heat lamps; however, come winter there's not a lot of seating.  It can be a real pain to get a seat, even when they're not busy.  So alas, I doubt I'll be here at too many peak times.

We shared a Toasted French Baguette with truffle butter and mixed mushrooms, and an Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The food was pretty good. The baguette smelled strongly of truffles, but it definitely smelled stronger than it tasted. Was hard to taste any truffle at all once you bite into the baguette. The mushroom mix on top was very flavourful though and made up for the lack in truffle taste. Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly. The yolk oozed out over the plate once you cut into it. I especially appreciated the root vegetables served with the dish. It's a bit different from other eggs benny dishes. Both dishes came with a side salad, which added some nice freshness.

This bad boy has no frills - just meat, guac, and salsa.  On a fresh tortilla.  No cheese.  No sour cream.  But damn is it tasty!  Still one of the better burritos I've had!  

Service was fast, order was even faster since we were like the only ones there that day.

A couple of things knocked this Roberto's down a star.  Ambiance.  So strange, who likes eating Mexican in the middle of a non-Mexican car wash station?  I literally sat on a tiny table next to the snack racks on one side, and the beer coolers on the other.  Need a Twinkie?  I could have reached out and grabbed one as dessert.  Other gripe is that this Roberto's has NO condiment/salsa bar like all the other ones do.  I like buffet options dammit!  I like making my own little plates of cucumbers, radishes, pickled carrots & jalapenos.  Plus I like copious amounts of red & green salsa for my meal.  None of this available at the Roberto's in the car wash station.  But they do have all of these items for you, just ask the cashier behind the Roberto's counter and they will give you little baggies & containers of veggies and salsa.  

Roberto's luckily your Carne Asada Burrito is just as good as the ones I've had before in other locations.  Meaty, fatty, rich, carb & calorie loaded, with a touch of fresh.  Just the way it should be!",2015-10-28 18:29:12

I guess it's good for pretty much everything if you're looking for great prices and/or large amounts! I agree with Nadia that this location is primo!

However, going to Costco can be an ordeal - you have to deal with parking, showing your id upon entering, finding what you're looking for, and then finding space in your car for everything you end up purchasing (which if you are anything like me, is much more than you anticipated going in).

The other day, I convinced future yelper, Alexa M, to join me for a 'quick trip' to Costco.  We were going in to purchase an ipod (birthday present for my sister).  That's all we were going to purchase.  But while we were there, we had to look around a bit... in addition to the ipod, we ended up checking out with a 12 pack of Dentyne Fire (my favorite gum), a DVD of season 3 of Prison Break (for Alexa), a 3 pack of Calvin Klein tank tops, and an itunes card to go with the ipod.  Upon check out, I was told that my Costco membership was up for renewal... so add another $100 to my total.

I paid and texted Jared that I renewed the membership and he called and said to get it reversed since he did it just a few weeks ago... add a Customer Service nightmare to this scenario as he gets on the phone and tells them it's been paid, Alexa leaves her keys in the ladies room (but luckily gets them back), I try to get reimbursed but the credit card machine won't work so they reimburse me cash instead, and then when we leave, the guy at the door realizes they charged me twice for the tank tops!

Ugh - I was happy they caught the double charge, but this trip ended up being even more of an ordeal than usual.  I will continue to go to Costco as soon as our membership renewal debacle is taken care of, but I will just make sure that when I go, I am patient and plan enough time...

Alexa - I'm sure you'll write a better review of our experience than I did.  Excited to see your review!",2008-08-31 01:33:49

XHivrkpdMW9tn7tgN8EY8g,jdqsQJqWBscCleYK5EhNuQ,K1nwSvx14on6eVBbu5E9rA,3,2,0,1,"When you walk in, the first couple of things think you think is sports bar meets seafood boil restaurant and cool interior design. Compared to The Captain's Boil, this place is bigger in size and has more of a sports entertainment vibe (and has plenty of bars on tap to match). With TVs lining the walls and a huge screen at one end of the restaurant, this place is built for keeping up with your fave teams. A group of four, we arrived around 7pm on a Sunday evening and the place was packed with groups waiting to be called. It took about 30-40 minutes for a table to free up for us. Once seated, we were greeted by a friendly, kind, and patient host who was knowledgeable about market prices (for dungeness crab, lobster, & crawfish) and super helpful in navigating the menu. 

We ended up ordering 5 items: A pound of shrimps ($12.95/lb) with the Good Catch Blend in mild and a cup of vermicelli on the side ($2.00), gumbo soup ($5.95), the soft shell crab basket ($13.95) with sweet potato fries (extra $1.00 for the fries upgrade to sweet potato; regular fries are included in the $13.95), fried calamari ($13.95), and the picture-worthy lobster nachos ($29.95). 

I would have rated Good Catch higher if not for the general saltiness of most of the items we ordered. While the flavours were definitely on par with what you'd expect and even a bit more than average, the salt levels in the calamari, soft shell crab, and gumbo soup were too high for all of us which was a let-down because had it not been for the salt, the dishes would have been closer to perfect (especially the soup and calamari; of all the three, the calamari was the saltiest then the crab then the soup though maybe it's just the night we came in - I don't see other reviews with the same issue). The lobster nachos, however, were up there on our list - the gooey cheesy, chunks of lobster were tossed together with black olives, tomato chunks, sour cream, jalapenos, onions, tri-coloured tortilla chips, and, oh yeah, guac (yay for not having to pay extra for guac though at $29.95 it needs to be included haha). Only complaint is it needs more lobster. The tail it comes with is empty - I'm guessing they've emptied it out for you to mix in with the nachos but the head still has meat stuff in it so chow away. The shrimps with the Good Catch blend, on the other hand, were the real highlight. You go to these seafood boil places mainly to experience the bib, gloves, and delicious mess and the shrimps we ordered did not disappoint. The blend wasn't salty - it was perfect, I'd say even better than the Captain's Boil blend. 

I'd recommend Good Catch - I'd come again mainly for their bagged seafood and spice blends and their menu is pretty extensive (more choices than Captain's Boil though Captain's has good stuff not offered at Good Catch). At the end of the day, Good Catch has a great atmosphere to relax in and definitely fits the downtown vibe Markham is building.",2017-05-15 16:01:41

We got charbroiled pork and a egg with chinese sausage bahn mi. It was indeed the same bread  and the veggie components were fresh. Charboiled pork was nicely seasoned and fragrant and the egg was fluffy and a good combo with the chinese sausage. 

Both our milk tea drinks were good - I got lychee green tea and he got plain milk tea. 

This spot lets you order at your table but I wouldn't really say this is table service really. You might have to wave if you need something or get up to the cashier to pay so be vocal or else you might sit there forever. 

Sit by the fish tank - the arothron dog faced puffer is super friendly and funny. He tries to show off to get attention.

When entering, you can turn right or left.  We turned left into the lounge area and made our way outside to the balcony.  What a beautiful view.  The DJ was jamming some good music and dancers were around. 

Later in the evening we found out that there were other rooms.  We then ended up going to the farther room (if I had turn right) which seems brighter in lighting and better crowd.

The inside looks tiny here, but there is an area upstairs that overlooks the front of the restaurant and the back brewing area. Service is always great up there even though you feel like you're tucked away in your own private alcove.

The beer list changes a fair bit and I appreciate the detailed descriptions on their menu card. I've tended towards trying the IPAs and have loved them all.

While Bellwoods gets a standing ovation for its beer, the food has to be applauded loud and long. This is not just a brewery with food, these are really well thought out and well prepared beer accompaniments. I wouldn't be surprised if people come here for grub who don't order beer. Me and my DC have mostly always ordered the same items on every visit and they've been consistently excellent - the kale and ryeberry salad, the duck meatballs - sometimes the fries, and the corn cobs when they're available... all are unique in their own way. We tried the queso fundido last time - surprisingly scoopable and so decadent with the chicharrones. Portion sizes are spot on.

We've only really had one food ""miss"" here - the smoked bratwurst (which seems to have disappeared the lamb sausage with fennel curry, which we really loved).

It's really just Taiwanese comfort food.  Really, really good comfort food.  I had the preserved egg with sausage & rice; sweet & spicy fried fish cake and a cabbage dish I can't remember the exact name of.

I'm not sure if it's because I was particularly famished that day, but that was definitely the best and most flavourful Taiwanese food I had in Toronto.  All I can say is this deserves a visit if you're ever around Markham.  I would definitely go back and try all the other items on their menu; each dish is dirt cheap and quantity is there.  However, service is not great because they got our order mixed up (not surprising due to volume of customers all the time) and also.. there's just no space to sit or even wait if you want take-out.

Go for the food and eat at the comfort of your car/home, this is a winner",2015-05-18 03:42:37

The menu had fun 80's and older song name for the dishes i.e. Paradise City, Buffalo Soldier. Incredibly small dining room though, a couple of tables and a couple outside. We sat outside which was nice except we were right next to the bus lane so as long as you don't mind bus patrons staring at you - then you are golden. I would have given this place four stars for the food but the lack of service knocked them down to three. 

Also for a dish made out of macaroni it seemed a bit pricey at the $11 price point after taxes, that being said I tried both the Buffalo Soldier (blue cheese with chicken nuggets with Frank's Red Hot Sauce) and the Sweet Home Alabama (Gouda mac'n'cheese with chicken nuggets with bacon and bbq sauce). 

I liked them both but for blue cheese the Buffalo Soldier had a very mild flavor, I preferred the Sweet Home Alabama (with my own added hot sauce of course). There was not a lot of sauce i.e. cheese but there was enough for flavor and the chicken was perfectly cooked, not greasy, with a crunchy light (panko?) breading. The portion size was decent too and we both left with left-overs. 

Also, tried the Fat Bottom Girls (cream puffs) one with chocolate and one without. It took quite some time to get our food, despite there only being one other customer that was already eating, so the cream puffs became our appetizer. 

My other complaints for service included when we went to get a take out box there was no one at the counter, my friend waited a good 10 minutes or so while trying to strain her neck to see if anyone was in the back before someone helped her. Also, we ended up bussing our own table - I supposed we could have just left everything outside but considering the area we didn't want anything to happen to their serving ware - so considering the lack of staff we decided to help them out. 

My friend ordered a soda and they forgot to give her the cup, she finally asked for it. 
Bottom Line - I enjoyed the comfort food and I think for macaroni and cheese they have some great flavor profiles, however the service was practically non-existant, and the prices weren't cheap, not expensive, but not cheap.",2014-05-09 22:39:55

I completely and whole heartedly invest my panini stock into Postino's. I am always left satisfied and with a smile. My top favorite panini i the Roast Beef, which is basically wood roasted beef with aged port salut cheese, onions, and the crispiest pickles ever. My second favorite is the Chicken & Mozzarella, which has grilled chicken with mozzarella, arugula, and spicy sun dried tomato mayo. I'm not a fan of the tomato mayo so I got it with just regular mayo. But hands down you gotta tr the Roast Beef.

If you put in an order of bruschetta, you get to pick 4 categories. My top 4 are White Bean with Chopped Tomato (i thought i was going to hate it, but it actually turned out to be my most favorite now), Warm Artichoke, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, and Tomato & Basil.

This place can get kind of loud, but nothing too wild to make me annoyed. The service was friendly, although I will say that I wish they had checked up on us more than just once.

Right after I entered the noodle shop, all the employees were shouting loudly in Japanese usual expression in turn: Irasshaimase, Irasshaimase! I felt so welcomed :p 

So, I decided to try the 'Tonkotsu' with boiled egg since it was one of their special dishes & highly recommended by the server. She brought some of the minced garlic and pickled ginger with it.  Without hesitation, I put a little bit of garlic in the soup just because I love garlic so much :)  I could totally taste of very rich and milky pork bone broth in my mouth. The noodle was very thin and straight. One of the toppings that really stands out was the sliced pork, the 'Chashu'. It was very tender and soft. 
Overall, I was happy with the Tonkotsu Ramen but, I liked the Miso Ramen with lots of bean sprouts @Shuseki little better. If someone wants to try richness of the broth & the amount of oil they want, the Tonkotsu Ramen is the one... 
Next time, I still want to try their Kimchi Fried Rice & Cold(chilled) Noodle(Hiyashi-chuka).

Upon check in at the hostess stand we were escorted to the lounge and would be called when our table was ready. A peak into the restaurant reveled many available tables but maybe their policy is not to seat guests early and also help increase the lounge beverage business. The lounge has plenty of interesting art and a great view of the strip from the outdoor patio. At 6:30 the hostess escorted to our dining room table. The dining room also has an patio with an outdoor bar. Live music begins later in the evening.
The artwork in the dining  room is also interesting. However, the room is tired and needs fresh paint and cleaning. Dust is obvious on some of the light fixtures and the light fixtures above the wall art could be better positioned so they are not skewed.
Our server was Amanda and she was assisted by Otto. Both  were attentive and knowledgeable of the menu Otto was especially talkative and entertaining. 
Both of us ordered from the Restaurant week menu. 
The crab cake appetizer consisted of two large patties topped by apple fennel slaw and surrounded by an apple mustard sauce. This dish was light and flavorful. The slaw added a nice crunch.
The 6 oz Filet of Beef was tender and cooked as requested. The baby carrots and cippolini onions were a perfect complement.
The Shrimp Thai Curry main course was described as spicy by our server. It delivered fantastic flavor with a pronounced amount of heat. The large shrimp were served in curry along with eggplant, cilantro, mint and Honshimeji mushrooms. A separate bowl contained a large portion of jasmine rice. I highly recommend this dish if you enjoy a spicy experience.

The molten chocolate cake includes two chocolate ganache truffles, and two raspberries. The truffles just melt in your mouth. The cake could have had more molten chocolate.
The calvados apple bread pudding with vanilla Ice Cream included a side container of warm sticky pecan caramel. When poured over the pudding it just melted the Ice Cream and soaked into the pudding. Just delicious and very rich.

I ended up ordering the shrimp scampi since it sounded really good and was highly recommended by the waitress. The dish itself was alright, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Honestly this was a dish I could probably make on my own at home (and I really don't cook often). The flavor didn't really feel cohesive to me and I think it's because the sauce didn't do a good job of bringing the dish together. The shrimp was good, but I had two tail pieces that were still left on, but considering the good amount of shrimp that I got, I guess it wasn't too bad.

However, this makes for a rather loud experience, and we could barely talk to each other during dinner.

We got the famous margherita pizza, and a sausage pizza (the Sam Giancana). The pizzas were decent -- each of us had our own preference, mine being the margherita. The crust was thin and chewy, and the tomato sauce was delicious. I would just mop up the tomato sauce on its own.

Little did I know that this hole in the wall joint will provide us with the best sandwiches and burgers in town! Brian perfected the art food to an exact science.

We ordered 502 fries- a pound of fries with chili, rib eye steak, pastrami, jalapenos, and grilled onions. 

Pastrami burger MOUNTED with two handfuls of pastrami! you could barely see the bun.

I got the gyro and we also got a Chipotle burger. Brian served us our food and even gave us step by step directions on how to eat every meal.

ALL WAS AMAZING! By the time we were done eating all of what we had we could barely breathe. but we pushed to try a custard milkshake. I tried the mango milkshake, but if you're going to try a milkshake try one thats off the menu the BANANA OREO MILKSHAKE its amazing. It tastes just like pie but in liquid form. We also tried the pomegranate lemonade and the strawberry lemonade to go with our meal. We walked out being four satisfied customers, and definitely a proud regular.

The amount of food they offer is more than what you paid for and definitely worth every penny. The best part is they offer you great conversation and the best sense of humor for FREE. That something you really can't find in any five star restaurant.

 I came for lunch and had the Warmed Kale salad with goat cheese cakes, which was really quite delicious and perfect for winter. My lunchmate had the Om Burger which also was good. Her side were the sauteed vegetables (also very good) s which came in a cute little tin. 

Less enjoyable was the coconut blueberry cupcake, which was too dense and didn't really taste like coconut. Also, the service was a bit spotty. While we were immediately seated and served quickly, and our water (cucumber-flavored!) glasses never were low, we were a bit annoyed that the server asked to take away our plates a number of times before we were done.

My wife ordered a burger that she pegged as the second (or third) best she's had in the valley. I had the brisket which had a nice little kick to it.

The meat and cheese plate felt a bit underwhelming. 1 cheese, a couple VERY thin slicers of a couple cured meats. Almonds. 3 pieces of bread. Mustard and some kind of preserve. We had to ask for the olives separately. That meat board is probably the main reason why I'm thinking 4 stars instead of 5.

Service was friendly but a tad slow. The bartender served us and he was friendly but when he had to tend bar, things got a bit slow. The restaurant is attempting to hire more staff so hopefully the speed will get better in time.

Restaurant has a nice decor and was clean. They have a full bar and the prices seemed reasonable. I would wish for a couple decent local brews on tap but I guess there are other options nearby for that.

Yes the menu is brief but honestly had a great variety!  The people next to us had the evening special which was beef stroganoff and they raved over it.

I've been to Azteca several times, but I'm always surprised by the little sopapillas they bring at the end as a complimentary dessert. Isn't that a wonderful little customer service bonus? You get used to the free nachos at Mexican spots, but the free dessert pushes Azteca over the line from a 4 star to a 5 star for me.

The ""letter system"" that they use in which customers were given a letter when purchasing a book that identified the group they were in for lining up was pretty effective.

But if the pizza is worth the wait, who cares?

Well, the dough is springy with a satisfyingly crispy crunch, especially around the edges. The ingredients were fresh. The roasted red peppers were visible, the tomato sauce was bright and tart, the fennel sausage made an appearance minus the fennel, the grana padano was grated on top along w/ the red onion and dollops of basil aioli added that same creaminess you get from ranch dipping sauce. All-in-all it wasn't worth the wait. All I tasted was bright, tart sauce and occasional tangy basil cream. The sausage, when I happened upon a piece, was occasionally fatty and flavorless which I found odd. On a positive note, it was filling enough for two hungry, but not starving adults.

Not only was there a sweet message on the box, but it even had a picture of us on the box... and it was wrapped in adorable ribbon.  

Inside the box was an assortment of cookies... 2 of each kind.  Also included was a sheet that contained descriptions of each cookie and instructions for heating up the cookies, making them crispier, and even freezing them.  My sweet tooth came on strong tonight and I remembered we had these cookies in our freezer - luckily my fiance didn't eat them all while I was out of town last week.

I decided on the ""Urban Cookie"" - ingredients include dark chocolate from Peru, rolled oats, toasted walnuts, and gourmet coconut bits.  I also made myself a cup of hot chocolate to go with it.  I think I am in cookie heaven.  I demolished the entire cookie but really tried to savor each bite.  

I'm excited to try the other flavors - I just hope I get to them before my fiance does!  I will likely use Urban Cookies for gifts in the future - they did a wonderful job!

1. The Food - It's just what you need to soak up booze, and it's cheap! 
2. The Staff - Lets face it.. when you are hungover you don't want to be seen or talk to people.. you want to sit down, get your coffee and eat.  That's what happens here, the staff doesn't want to talk much either. 
3. The Location - It's tucked right on the side of Detroit, very close to downtown, and depending where you were the night before might be near where you left you car.. not that I'd ever do that.... 

Important to Note - Doesn't take cards!  You need cash.  There is an ATM inside but for some reason it refuses my card every time.",2010-10-14 00:10:31

I tried this place out months ago and I didnt think it deserved a review. The only reason why im doing this now is because I had a what I thought was a weird dream until I woke up and realized it was a nightmare!

Bare with me. So here's my my Nightmare on Pho Street. 

Me and my wife just happen to be driving down Jones Blvd wondering what to eat for dinner. We see the sign that they were on the food network. Can't go wrong with that right? So we mosy on in and see that it is a nice sized restaurant. I see plenty of tables but only see one person eating soup by herself. Weird because it was around 6:30 dinner time. Out of nowhere this old crazy lookin lady sits us down. 

I look at the menu and wonder if the prices were in Vietnamese knowing that the US dollar has slipped a little bit. So im thinkin a small bowl of pho and a small bowl of oxtail soup wasnt gonna max out my credit card. All the while the old asian lady was throwing out suggestions like an announcer at a horse track only with a heavy asian accent. ""You want try eggrolls?"" No thanks. ""How bout spring rolls?"" No thanks. ""You want order drink?"" No thanks just water. ""You wanna no soda?"" Just water.

So off she went to go submit our order. I don't know if she was mad or if it was normal because it sounded like she was having some sort of argument with what I assume was the cook. 

After about 8 minutes she brought out our food. My wife was in the bathroom at the time so I decided to to take the opportunity to photograph our food. All of a sudden the asian lady comes out of nowhere and says ""What you doing? You should eat the soup right away. It's good hot!"" I explained to her that I was about to take a picture and that I was waiting for my wife to come back. She just gave a ""I don't understand confused look."" 

The two stars are for the pho and oxtail soup. I thought it was tasty BUT that's the only positive thing. Since we both ordered small bowls, we weren't hungry any more but at the same time we could have eaten more. Kinda pricey for small bowls too. That and the ""Hurry up and buy!"" attitude of the old asian lady did not help either. Im not makin fun of her. All that I described was what actually happened.

So I guess you can say she was Freddy Krueger and we were the hapless sleeping victims. I don't think I will be coming back. If you want good Pho place at decent prices and better service, I recommend Pho So 1. That's my go to Pho place.",2012-08-24 05:45:00

And I picked a great day to go the park. I wanted to treat the boys to a last of summer hurrah and they really wanted to go to WnW (they went last year with a camp). So I did some research, read reviews here and went on their website - they offer a discounted price Mon - Wed - that must mean there are less people there on those days! Yeah I believe it was true!

Tuesday morning I'm on the website and ordering the discounted tickets only to get a message that I ""timed out"" please check your email in 60 minutes to see if your order went through. What? I need to leave now since I have to drive an hour to get there. They are only open from 11 - 5 in August. We ate lunch on the way and arrived at 1pm.

So we leave the house thinking I'll check email on my phone. It takes an hour almost exactly from my S. Gilbert home. We pay for parking ($7)which I find so strange except I'm hoping this means less of a chance of someone breaking into my car where I've left a few valuables. We walk to the ticket counter and I tell her my story of the website. She checked the computer and determined my order didn't go through and honored the discounted rate of $109 for four people. 

I didn't know what to expect or what to bring so I'm telling you in case you are wondering too:

I brought a big beach bag with sunscreen, four towels, a change of clothes for all and a liter of water for all, and cash. 

You really don't need towels, nice to have but it's dry here you will dry off fast. 

The change of clothes was nice to have as we went to dinner after. A hair brush would have been nice to have too.

Bring more then a liter for each person it's dry and hot and if you are like me and scream you will need more water. 

I left the beach bag on the lounge chair in the shade and rented a locker for car keys and cash. Peace of Mind.

Next time I would bring sunglasses like Oakley's that fit well and wear them on the rides. It was awful not to wear any.

Everyone wore flip flops - must have - wear them through the lines then slip them on your hands/wrist/arms when you ride. (Some cool girl in line explained this to me.) Some kids leave them next to the line but then you have to run on very, very hot cement to get them after the ride. I heard a kid tell his parents - ""my flip flop broke so I took another pair that looked like them."" I didn't hear his parents say anything like put them back. So keep yours close.

We rode the tornado, raging river, Phoenix something, toilet bowl and m (something) falls, constrictor, wave pool. Tornado was the best we did that  twice. The Phoenix was fun but no misters made it too hot. Everything else was misted on this 108* day. The wave pool wasn't too crowded but definitely the most. I could see my smaller guy get in a bit of trouble in the waves in the deep end, the waves can be big and strong - scary. 

The only thing we bought was three Icee's for $14 and it was worth it. 

In the end a very good day - everyone had fun no complaints. I could give it five stars but it's my first, I hate to think this is the best and no misters at the Phoenix ride.",2011-08-03 06:11:57

The beer part they have down pat. After browsing through their enormous menu during my last visit I ordered a mixed beer that combined a draft beer (Can't remember which) and raspberry ale. It was a heavenly mix, I won't lie. So, seriously, if you like beer, you need to go here, and even if you don't like beer mixes like the one I got are fruity and sweet enough that you'll probably enjoy them regardless. 

The service, well, my experience wasn't totally awful but it wasn't exactly quick, either. If they only have one or two bartenders on staff, it's really hard to get your order. I had to pace along the bar a couple times before I could get them to notice me and it wasn't even particularly crowded when I went. Don't get me wrong, the staff were very nice once I actually got their attention - but given just how massive the bar area they're serving behind really is, it's the getting their attention part that you might have problems with.

Would I come here again? It depends. The Beer Market is great for large groups or friends meeting up and interacting in a casual environment after work, but it's not so great if you're looking for food to go with your beer, especially given the availability or lack thereof of options for meals-to-go in this particular area.

so anyway - this is the place that started it all. Seriously. This location has been here since 2005. The bartender/waitress has been working here since the place opened. You can't NOT believe me because the whole bar decor 'spills' it. HA! get it? Anyhoot.  The sign for 88 flavors was more than enough to suffice the gluttonous beast I am inside. On the positive note - they only use Canola Oil. No trans fat - waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa????? Oh ye. 

The flow of the entire place isn't constructed strategically. It's the basic blueprint of a bar. 1 long bar , booths along the window and some random tables chairs in middle. There's some postings for wing hot sauce competitions that keep the locals busy. I got a few good material for Alias names here. Apparently the Black Mamba is the most dangerously HAWT sauce of dem all - (Texas sand dune tune)...If I could type it out.. I would...

They have daily specials that aren't really extraordinary but the only one I'd urge you to come for is Monday - All you can eat. Say waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa??. 
for $22.99 you can eat all the wings you want. With the purchase of any beverage. Only catch is , everyone at your table has to get the all you can eat special and no doggy bags allowed. 

The bathrooms are redone and speak awhole notha language. I don't trust it, but it works. 

The menu is one long laminated page with different types of wing sauces. Some scary, some just down right odd, some make me call Dr. Frasier Crane , some make me believe I could been a wing-sauce mixing prefessor...at Harvard. 
 
The service is very local bar ;friendly but nothing too ritzy - which is standard for a wings joint. The wait time was a tad longer than expected but a few beers usually does the trick ;)

A few suggestions that will have you craving
Dry Lemon Pepper
Mediterranean Dry - ask for dipping sauce with this. 
Garlic Parm - do you really have to ask?
Horseradish - yip
Pineapple Curry - sweet and sour 
Taj Mahal - different
Hot Hawaiian Honey - sweet but mustardy
Cajun Creole Dijon - My favourite. Dry mustard type of sauce with a zing


The bill was all under $40 for 2 which is pretty rad and with the open past 1am , I'll be back.

So please, take this with a grain of salt. The dinner meals were about $15 each ($20 with tax and tip). This certainly surpasses the upper end of what I like to spend on a casual meal. Add a drink to that and you're headed to low $20+. The meals are larger than one person needs - but not quite large enough for two; the wife and I shared, but both left a bit hungry.

Everyone in the family appears to be lending a hand somewhere here, managing, serving, cooking, seating, and so on. The food itself I found to be done well enough and everyone there made you feel welcome and appreciated, like a member of their own family. I couldn't be happier with the service itself, and again, I wouldn't consider myself an aficionado when it comes to Scandinavian, but just about everything on the menu was fried, potatoes, or fried potatoes, so dieters beware. With that nugget of wisdom, I'd have preferred something not quite as fried.

Restaurant looks clean, we requested to sit out at the patio since the weather was nice. Scott our server greeted us, put down the complimentary chips and salsa (which was alright - not bad not good). Service was okay. Scott checked us frequently and made sure our drinks were filled. We didn't really talk much, no how are you today/is this your first time here etc. But he wasn't rude. He was alright. Anyway we ordered the Chile Verde Shrimp Enchilada, Spicy hot wings, Jalapeño Burger and a pumpkin flan for dessert. We had the green tamales to go as well. For drinks my bf had dos equis and I had a raspberry hibiscus lemonade. 
The pumpkin flan and the tamales were outstanding. The rest however, wasn't memorable. 

Bad parts: 
Ordered hot wings and it seemed we got buffalo flavored wings that was sprinkled by dried chili peppers. (See the picture) Nope, not even hot at all. It was a tad bit overcooked too so it was dry and wasnt juicy/succulent. My shrimp enchilada had the tiny shrimps inside, I know that shrimps are up this season since I work at a restaurant as well so I didn't really mind but the flavor was just lacking. The Mexican rice tasted like it was mixed with 3 cups of butter. I wasn't happy at all. Didn't finish it. My bf had their jalapeño burger and as Ive said in the description of my photo, it tasted like burger king with just salsa on top. The fries though were pretty decent. He didn't finish either. And we were starving when the food arrived. 

All in all, sitting on the patio was a major plus but watch out what you order. If it's your first time, better ask what's popular first and probably stick with that.

The staff here is incredible. Everyone was very friendly, on point, and went out of their way to be helpful and to make us feel comfortable. It's also pet friendly 

The rooms are newer, large, tastefully appointed, and full of amenities. Wifi is fairly quick, and it is included in the nightly rate... (Also, no hidden resort fees here!) My complaints about the room are few... They have HD TV's in the rooms, but the signal is analog, and the mattress was starting to show some age (with wallows, or ruts, in other words). 

My main issue is that this hotel is one that still offers ""smoking"" rooms. We could smell the smoke from these rooms in the halls and it even found it's way into our room through the cracks in the door. Non-smokers will NOT be happy if you're room ends up next to a smoker.

The public facilities are numerous and great, with the standout being a nice lobby bar stocked with some better names in wine and liquor, especially tequila, and big new HD TV's for watching a game. We ate at the onsite SWB restaurant and tried their ""Wine me Dine me"" dinner, which was fantastic and a real treat (see separate review for more). The meeting facilities are top notch, and the grounds are very nice.

The pool area is currently being renovated, with only the former ""adults pool"" now open, and I'm hoping it's going to be renovated as well, since the stone flooring under the lounge chairs is filthy, looking dated and in serious need of a deep cleaning.

Ate here for dinner before my flight back to Winnipeg. My parents and I were in the Square One area, and wanted to eat somewhere close to the airport, and a quick Yelp search brought this interesting place up.

The place wasn't too busy at 6pm, but it quickly filled up as we dined. It's been a while since we dined at a Korean restaurant, so we took a bit of time looking at the menu. At the end, we ordered a seafood soontofu and the sliced brisket BBQ for two. It didn't sound like a lot, but I wasn't really too hungry as I had lunch about 3 hours before.

We noticed a lot of tables ordered the fried chicken as we were waiting for our food, so that's definitely gonna be on our list next time. Regardless, the food that we ordered was really good. The brisket was juicy and had that nice sweetness that I'm accustomed to in Korean BBQ. The soontofu was about what I expected, it's hard to really go wrong with this to be honest.

Service was good, though sometimes you had to manually wave someone down instead of pressing the button, especially the couple of times they were busy due to the place filling up extremely fast. 

Definitely will go for the Korean fried chicken next time I dine here.",2018-03-17 01:40:11

Upon entering, Alex the owner greeted my friend and myself and asked if it was our first time here. He told us they have nutella in all their waffles, but we can substitute it with another sauce if we'd prefer. As he was introducing the menu options to us, one of his customers was leaving and informed us ""you won't be disappointed, ladies!"" That loyalty. Anywho, I ordered the #8: waffle, strawberries, nutella, and vanilla ice cream. It was $8.30. My friend ordered the #10, which was everything included in my order, plus bananas. Hers was $10.45. 

Alex informed us that we don't pay until we got our food, so we waited less than 10 minutes and then he called us up to grab our waffles/pay. We were the only customers in WaffleU, but it started picking up speed around 4pm that Saturday. While I greatly enjoyed my freshly made waffle, I must admit that I've had better (and bigger) dessert waffles elsewhere. I think what made WaffleU so successful before (and currently) was Alex's personal touch. 

Right before we left, I asked Alex about the unlimited toppings I'd been hearing about. He informed me that he only offers that promotion during special events or holidays, the most recent being Easter weekend. I'll definitely be back to try the unlimited greatness.

At first glance, it seemed like a small serving, but after digging in, it became clear that there was no way I was going to finish it - very filling. Based on the mac 'n' cheese (and my friend's insistence on the excellent wings), I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.

Zinburger is fine. I feel a gourmet hamburger walks a very fine line. On its own, hamburgers are easy to make and incredibly delicious. Typically, I find that gourmet placed add too many ingredients, play with the meat too much, use buns that are ill-fitted for hamburgers, and in so doing, ruin the brilliance of a burger. I have been to gourmet burger joints that have elevated, but more often than not, they careen down the chasm of bad burgers in their belief that bigger is better. Zinburger teeters on the edge of too much tinkering. 

The meat is always loose, wet and lacks much in the way of flavor. The buns they use often seem overwhelmed by the massive amount of toppings that accompany most burgers. The toppings themselves are typically unnecessary (to be fair, you can build your own burger).

What Zinburger does really well is virtually everything else. The milkshakes come in a good portion and are very delicious (and look great). The regular fries are forgettable, but the zucchini sticks, sweet potato fries and especially the absolutely delicious truffle fries are worth the extra price. The beer and wine list is nice and the bar is well set-up. There are always plenty of kids around, so they are very kid-friendly too. 

The managers are always very nice and receptive. We ate there recently and my mom felt her meal was undercooked. With no questions asked, the manager gave us 25% off our meal.

I fell victim to this place, much like a fly getting zapped by a mesmorizing bug light.

Walking in, I was kinda impressed. It seemed like this place had it all. It was like a mashup of everything I go out of my way for: convenience store drinks & snacks, Asian sandwiches, baked goods, frozen yogurt (coming soon), coffee, smoothies, boba, etc. It had all of this, plus it was open 24/7.

I was happy... giddy even. The concept of this store brought out the inner schoolgirl in me. 

That all went downhill after I placed my order. I ordered a sandwich; a grilled pork one. 

Price wasn't too bad. Maybe around the $4 spot.. decided to order a coffee with it as well. I sat at my table eagerly waiting (still on a schoolgirl mindset). Place wasn't really all that busy. Somehow, I still ended up waiting for my sandwich and coffee for over 10 minutes. A bit too long for a simple order. They call out order numbers using a DMV-like system. I'm guessing they're also trying to mimic the DMV wait times as well. Kinda boggles my mind to see how long it took, when I see what seems like 50 employees working the kitchen.

After I got my order, I no longer was ecstatic. My inner giddiness turned into a neutral feeling. The baguette bread of my sandwich was hard, almost stale tasting; the pork: nothing impressive.  After the first bite, I had the most plain pokerface going on. It was a bland, dry, and overall, a depressing food. 

The coffee had a very strong flavor, though creamed and sweetened to the max. The coffee taste was so intense that I felt like I was getting smacked in the face with a sack of coffee beans with each sip. I kinda liked it, in a kinky sort of way. 

Am I coming back to this place? Probably not. I know there's some new store kinks going on, but I just don't see how it can get much better than my initial visit.

Chu Chee Roasted duck - duck pieces are variable. The first time I ordered there wasn't a lof of meat but it was much better the second time around. The curry sauce is delicious with the right amount of cream and spices.

Chicken Tom Kha (coconut soup) - ordered it medium spicy and while the broth was really tasty, it was too spicy for me. Next time I will go milder for sure. Definitely a treat for the tastebuds!

Staff is nice and friendly, I appreciate that they give me an accurate waiting time for take out orders depending on how busy they get (and they are often busy which means lots of people like this place as well!)

I've been to Dukes countless times as it is my work team's 'local' / drinking hole. It offers such a consistency of experience and at this point is warm and familiar like a cozy old sweater. It's not that it is the most amazing establishment I've even been to, but for what it is it's great. Yes, it is a pub, a chain, and a place where the female staff have to wear silly outfits. Even so, we are fond of it. When my parents came to visit me in Canada we came here twice.

Some of the best features of Dukes are as follows:
- Half priced bottles of wine between 11am and 4pm from Monday to Friday (try the Argentinian pinot grigio) 
- Solid snack options: fries, nachos, sweet potato fries, kettle cooked chips
- Decent burgers: I find the veggie burger really hits the spot
- Large patio for the warmer months
- They take reservations and respond even if you are cutting it close
- Not pretentious considering the location
- The darkness and dark booths inside are kind of comforting and make you feel like you have a bit of anonymity even if you are drinking 100 feet from your work and likely surrounded by people from other departments
- Pretty consistent service and no snarky server attitude if you sit down with 5 people only to share one half priced bottle of wine and no food

I'll also mention that it can get pretty noisy and busy.  But, the tables are laid out in a way that you don't feel like you are sitting on top of other people or listening in on their conversations. It is also pretty clean, decent washrooms and doesn't smell too much like beer. So if you are looking for an easy, no fuss place to grab a drink/feed during lunch or after work in the FiDi the Duke of Devon is your place.",2016-11-11 17:25:25
C8Lx2X4djPsBX62YhoiUQA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,wOIh5bvOsSv1zcRrX6A8Lw,3,2,0,0,"After reading positive reviews from Phoenix Mag, here on Yelp, and from a friend, we decided to give Avalon a shot. Despite the fact that OpenTable showed they had open reservations 8:00, we arrived just before 8 to be told it'd be a 5-10 minute wait. 15 minutes later, we asked the hostess what was going on, and she said, ""Oh, okay, I can seat you now"" and walked us back to a dining room with about 5 open tables. I understand that restaurants seat based on server and not based on open tables, but making patrons wait with so many open tables is just bad business. As it would turn out, waiting is something we'd do a lot that evening.

After sitting down, we waited 5 minutes for the waiter to come over to ask about drinks. He brought our waters and then disappeared for 15 minutes. We had to flag down one of the hostesses to ask for some bread and to get our server so we could order. In the mean time, I noticed that another table sat down and waited about 10 minutes for their server to even show up at all, but at least once she did she got them drinks and bread immediately.

The first thing we noticed on the menu was that the chef had changed (it turns out the original chef left right after the new year). Once we did get our server, we ordered the organic greens salad, shrimp fettuccine carbonara, lamb osso bucco, and side of sauteed spinach.

The salad was a joke. For $8 you get about 8 bites of salad (the dressing is nice, though), plus they split ours in the kitchen, so we each were served a plate with about 4 bites. I don't care if it cost $3, you shouldn't serve anything that ridiculously small. The carbonara was quite good, with the added touch of lemon lightening up a typically heavier dish, but the osso bucco was pretty bland (although here the portion was huge). The spinach side was as small as the salad. Typically sides are enough for two to share, so if they're going to serve these petite sides, they should explain that to diners. The best dish was actually the dessert, banana bread pudding, which makes sense since the original chef was the former pastry chef for Sam Fox's restaurants.

After our dessert, we waited 15 more minutes from the time we asked for the check until our waiter returned. He apologized and said they were short staffed, but it was clearly just an effort to try to get a better tip.

The service was really a deal breaker for this place. And all of these problems could have been avoided if the hostess had just explained that they were short staffed and what the wait for a table (and good service) would actually be. That said, even if the service was perfect, I don't think the food was as exceptional as what I've had elsewhere for the same price, with the exception of the dessert. I don't see this place lasting long if these problems continue",2010-01-17 14:36:31

Great Dane has been in business since 1994 and is the first brewery to open in Madison since 1966. The building is amazing (you know me and my love for old buildings!)- it is split between a Queen Ann style and a Victorian brick both looking to be from the early to mid 1800's. There is a historic plaque outside that explains that this was once a fine hotel in Madison. The remodeling showcases the interior brick walls, a mahogany bar and a rathskeller in which the beer is made. But the coolest spot? An outdoor garden with brick pavers and up lighting makes this one of the best al fresco dining areas in the city. 

The bartender took care of me until my friends arrived- offering me samples of their local brewed goodness cuz I couldn't make up my mind. He knew all along just what I would like (sorry Dave- should have listened to you from the start!) 

We moved to a table with the gang arrived and had some tasty appetizers and burgers. When in Wisconsin- do as they do so everything we had was laden with cheese- deep fried cheese curds, nachos buried in cheese and meat and even a cheddar melt burger with onions and cheese. Now this was calorie worthy grub! 

Like playing pool or shuffleboard? They've got your game! And there is live music (so I am told) Thursday through Sunday. The staff is friendly and quick- keeping the beers flowing and the food coming. 

Dinner for 6 was around $80. Cheap, cheap cheap. But fun.

I had them work on a tooth which they said should be a root canal but they would wait to see if it is. They charged me over $600 for this procedure. I got a letter in the mail from my insurance saying it was free adn they paid for it. I had to call and ask them for my money back. They said they would have to look into everythign first. Over a week goes by and they call me to tell me that I would be refunded in a few weeks. 

After they worked on my tooth, the pain was wasy worse. I go in AGAIN for the root canal where the doctor ended up putting the tooth IN my hand thinking my hand was the assistant. She laughed it off like nothing. This process took OVER 2 hours. 

I went home and started having crazy bleeding and painful gums on the SAME tooth. I notice it looked bruised in the back. I started touching it and a cord came out that they LEFT in my mouth. I called to tell them so I booked ANOTHER appointment. They gave me a rinse to use and put more cement on the tooth. Then asked me to come back AGAIN to see if my gums are still receding from the cap. They STRONGLY recommend it. So I made my follow up appointment. I asked how do I know they are not going to screw up again. They said

They made this new rule to double check to make sure all the cords are taken out. 

(I asked them countless times to work with me on weekends since I work during the week and they would NOT accommodate even though they keep screwing up)

I went back to get it fixed since leaving the cord in cause my gums to receed leaving an open space between my tooth and the gums. 9 days later, the cap fell out and I had to reschedule ANOTHER appointment to get it fixed. 

I STRONGLY do not suggest anyone to go here. I would of switched dentist but since they were working on this tooth for MONTHS I knew my insurance would not cover someone else's mistake.",2012-08-17 18:28:33

Either would be fine, but it is hard to do both.  The museum was pretty cool, especially if you like mob history.  In the middle of the interactive game, you go into several rooms with photos, news clipping, and artifacts.  Again- it was still interesting, but it is hard to stop the game midstream and looks at stuff.  Maybe they should move the museum part to the end?

So this was my first visit to a cat café in general, and I definitely wasn't disappointed.
The whole establishment is vegan which frankly makes a lot of sense to me given the fact that we're all animal lovers here (why do the other cat cafés not have more vegan stuff??). We just grabbed (inexpensive) iced coffees but I'll definitely be back to try other stuff.

In terms of space and atmosphere, it was perfect- there's a cozy inclosed patio space with twinkle lights where the cats seem particularly happy. The inside of the café is adorable with lots of saturated-colour item furniture; great artwork; lots of cat paraphernalia; and soft, ephemeral tunes playing.

The only down side was maybe that there were only four cats in the whole establishment and they're clearly very used to a lot of affection from patrons. Needless to say, for the most part the kitties were not interested in hanging out with us. I reckon this is probably a regular thing for cat cafés. They were still fun to look at though!

Sadly, I don't think this dream will come true anytime soon, but because of that I cherish anytime I get a spa day and I'm pleased that my visit to Agave Spa was everything I hoped it would be!

The Westin Kierland itself is gorgeous and flawless, but it has more of a concrete decor feel to it. It doesn't have the Old Phoenix feel to it like some, but it's clean, gorgeous and flawless just the same. The Agave Spa has just the same feel. 

Walking in, I immediately caught wind of the delicious signature scent of the spa. It smelled so good, I wanted to put the scent in my bag and keep it with me at all times. The staff was extremely friendly right off the bat and quickly showed us to the ladies locker room to get us settled. I like to arrive to the spa as early as possible in order to enjoy as much time there as possible. 

Once I was settled in, I first used the gym to feel better about the pampering I would be doing later. As hard as it is to actually work out on a spa day, it makes me feel so much better and I've added it to my spa routine. But, I make sure I do it when I first arrive. The gym is refreshing because it overlooks the pool. The treadmill is state of the art, offered me way more options than I needed and even had a tv built inside. After my workout, it was time for the massage. The 50 minutes massage was just what the doctor ordered! The masseuse was friendly but not overly chatty which I really appreciate in a masseuse. The room felt refreshing and the music was soothing. The only problem I had with the room was that it was a little too bright for my liking, but then they put a scented mask on my eyes which helped. 

After my heavenly massage, we continued our girls day out and winded down in the jacuzzi, ordered lunch and drinks while we laid out at the tranquil adult's-only pool and used every amenity the spa had to offer. I decided to shower at the spa because the showers are gorgeous with the popular Westin shower heads and delicious Kai products.

A young lady greeted me with a genuine smile, I told her it was my first time and and she kindly made some recommendations to me which I appreciated a lot. I ended up buying a chocolate cupcake, a carrot one with a cream cheese frosting, one that was called ""the monkey"" (it had chocolate chips, some cinammon and fresh banana pieces!) a ginger cookie and a brownie. To make it short I was IMPRESSED by the texture of all of them, once you bite into them, there is not crumbs to be worried about, they also have the right amount of sweetness, I did not feel that grainy end once you swallow, you know what i am talking about? When you keep clearing your throat because of the 5 cups of sugar you just had?? NONE of that with these beauties!! I could taste every single ingredient in such a fresh way!

We ended our dinner by sharing a sticky toffee pudding which is one of the best desserts I've had anywhere. The service was great. The second time was on a Saturday afternoon. My friend and I shared a plate of nachos - they were some of the best that I've ever had. There was lots of cheese, the cajun chicken was nice (sliced rather than chunks or crumbled up in a sauce). The jalapeno crema was a nice hint of spice. I had a margherita pizza for lunch which was okay - lots of cheese but the tomato was a bit soggy. Again, I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert but it was just okay this time - it was a bit burned on the underside. Our service was decent except that we had to ask for water 3 times.

For those who are not familiar with HK style milk tea, it is a blend of Indian and Chinese teas designed to maximize aroma and flavour, and is meant to be had super strong, with condensed milk, also in very strong portions.  You can have it iced or hot, but the flavour has to be in your face.

This is the best incarnation of HK style tea I've had in Canada.  The owner apparently won a competition in HK for best HK style tea a few years back, and has been featured in the Toronto Star.

The décor is definitely old school Scarborough, meaning no frills and basic.  When you walk in you're greeted by old uncles chatting in Cantonese while watching news from HK.  There is a newer location in Richmond Hill, but this is the original so you get 'authenticity' with your visit.  If you're dropping in though, be sure to try the food, particularly the HK style breakfast favourites.  They have all the classics like macaroni and instant noodles soup, with different toppings like pork chops, ham etc...  

One time I wanted the pork chop pineapple bun sandwich for breakfast but the bakery doesn't deliver the pineapple buns until later in the day so I went for a rice noodle with satay beef on top.  Everything tastes as it should, with the satay sauce complementing the beef nicely and lettuce on the side.

A word of caution though: for those of you coming in expecting traditional Chinese food, or Thai style food, you won't get it here, but what you will get is a delicious tea, and a taste of HK's melding of different cultures from all around the world.",2015-06-09 01:14:55

It's outrageous to enforce a no backpack policy because of the shooting that happened months ago. Don't let one incident affect the everyday lives of good people.

The second reason is the casino hosts. I gambled pretty big there one day and lost a good amount of money. I was contacted by casino hosts with various offers to get me to come back. I went back on my own, won a lot of money, then I reached out to the host to accept his offer for free tickets.

Sterle's offers family style dining for parties of 8 or more so we opted for that (at $20 a person).  It gave us the opportunity to try multiple main courses.

Ive been wanting to try the cupcakes here for quite some time now and was uber excited when I finally got here. The place is small and have no tables for you to sit,chill, and eat..so it's more of a takeout place. My bf and I got here around 2 so this will probably explain why th cupcakes were dry? Anyway, I got the vanilla with regular icing and my bf got the chocolate with peanut butter icing and choc ganache center. I guess mine wasn't as dry as my bf's cupcake but I never thought I'd miss smiths cupcakes...yes ive had better. The choc/peanut butter on the other hand was just dry. The choc ganache did not help with the dryness either. It was thick and too rich so the combo of dryness and thickness made us want more and more water like no tomorrow. By the time we were finish we were both making weird hacking noises because it felt like there was a piece of cake stuck in our throats.

In Depth Review: I have been driving by this little restaurant tucked away in the old Holsum Bread Bakery on Charleston Ave and wanting to check it out since it opened 5 years ago. This past Thursday (7/17/14), I had the chance to go after a shopping trip across the street at the Premium Outlets with my wife. We got there at 8pm and the sign in the window switched to ""closed"" as we were walking up. The same sign said: ""open til 9pm,""  so we went in and took our chances. Restaurant was full and we were greeted by the GM named Hank at the entrance. Hank was friendly, said he would get us sat and that they switch to closed at 8pm sharp as that is the last seating time. So arrive early folks or you may not be seated to eat. This small but cozy place was full on a Thursday night. Seating is very limited, so I advise a reservation in advance (especially on the weekend). 

I was thirsty. Hank suggested a Louisiana micro brewery that they carry named Abita. Never had it and went with their Amber beer. It was chilled and was quite possibly the best beer I have had in a long time. Have since went to Total Wine & Liquor here in Vegas and filled my fridge with it. Try it, you can thank me later. 

Hank knew we were very hungry and that it was our first time visiting Lola's, he was kind enough to bring over a nice sampler of three of their best selling items. This was a nice touch and it solidified what we would eventually order as our entrees. He introduced us to our waitress and she was very knowledgeable of the dishes and made made good suggestions, including the crab-cake appetizer. We each ordered one and they were AMAZING! This is real crab, they are fresh, massive and not the frozen ""Krab"" cakes that many high-end restaurants try to pass off as ""authentic"" in Vegas. 

For our entrees we ordered the Catfish and Gouda Cheese Grits and Shrimp and Gouda Cheese Grits. The dishes were large and plentiful. The dishes were love at first bite. These Gouda Cheese Grits are a divine experience. Every bite was full of flavor. I inhaled my Shrimp and Gouda Cheese Grits and literally used the soft garlic bread to wipe the plate clean of any remaining evidence, I mean sauce. Both plates are a MUST try! 

We took some of Lola's special ""bread pudding"" home with us to eat later as we were both very full after eating our entrees. The bread pudding was also a divine experience that you must have if you visit. So good!!! 

Hank checked on us as we were finished and was kind enough to introduce us to the owner, Lola. We spoke to her and she was very kind and welcoming. She was happy that we had finally stopped in and invited us to come back and be part of the ""family."" I felt her words were legit and that she truly meant that. Good to see an owner be a gracious host and talk to the tables and guests. She touched every table and said goodbye to everyone. Could tell many guests were her regulars as she knew them by first name. What hospitality, you just don't see this in Vegas these days! 

Overall: I cannot wait to go back. I have already told dozens of people about my experience at Lola's last Thursday. Lola, Hank and the entire ""family"" at Lola's will welcome you with open arms. Just call ahead first and make that reservation, space is limited and it will fill up.

I basically couldn't tell how fresh the fish really was with the seasoning.  Was still enjoyable but mostly in the beginning before the heat just kind of killed it.  I would go back to try it but I would definitely tell them to ease up on the spice.  Less is more.  3/5.

What I like is that they take basic dishes (i.e shrimp cocktail/spinach artichoke dip/ asparagus) and make them something special- they put a twist on it. I am reminded of Top Chef when contestants are asked to put a new spin on an old favorite.

 The chilled shrimp appetizer was delicious! I loved all of the sauces (2 unique one classic cocktail) - I wish there were more shrimp in the portion because it was so tasty.

Asparagus Fries- huge asparagus stems covered in a light tempura served with soy vinaigrette and aioili - wow- just awesome!

Spinach Artichoke dip - with yucca chips- nice!

They have a bunch of frozen dishes you can grab off the conveyor belt kinda like genki sushi in Hawaii! But basically you choose a broth (which they have like 5 types) and you choose your meat dish (beef combo) and you can choose your noodles (noodle combo) and you veggies. 
My server was deni and he was SUPER helpful with explaining to us how to order and what is most popular and he was a very good server! He made our experience more enjoyable! 
There's also a whole area JUST for sauces! You can go and pick all your sauces and they don't charge so you can try all of them if you want. 
Half way through eating I thought I wouldn't be able to finish!!! There was so much food and it was so filling. I thought the bill would be over $100 since there was so much to eat. 
Surprisingly the bill came out to $60 and for the amount we ate it was DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. This place is of course just another hot pot spot that just opened but it really beats all the other hot pots in town.

I was craving breakfast food and saw that they served a vegetarian sausage meal, which consisted of the sausages, 2 eggs, toast, and homefries. However, I didn't want homefries so I asked if I could sub it for a side salad. The server, who wasn't very friendly tbh, said it would cost an additional $2! So then I asked if I could instead get the traditional breakfast, which has 2 eggs, sausage, and toast, but have the vegetarian sausage instead. All he responded with was ""you're basically ordering the same thing, so it'll cost the same"". 
Instead of starting an argument I settled for the first option and had no choice but to pay extra for the tiny bowl of leaves. 
My friend got the chicken fingers with fries. It took around 10-12 minutes for the food to arrive. The serving size was decent and the chicken fingers were good according to my friend.
As for my meal I wasn't that thrilled about it. First of all my ""toast"" was barely toasted, since it was soft, maybe not even toasted at all. Then the worst part of it were the eggs. I asked for my eggs to be poached. The server didn't ask how I would like my eggs cooked, and I assumed poached eggs should usually be served soft or medium. but my eggs were cooked completely well done (i.e., yolk cooked until firm). I have definitely had better diner food and for the price, this meal was no worth it at all!

Now I completely understand that it's nobody's fault if there's no produce left to pick because hey that's a harvest for you! No one can force them to grow more on demand, and yea its nearing the end of October so I can see how maybe we missed out and should've came earlier but our work schedules simply don't allow us that luxury. 

But it was disappointing to come all that way and not even leave with a pumpkin. We did have a nice time walking around together through the orchards but besides that it was a miss for me.

Even if we did find something to pick I wouldn't of wanted to waited in the line that had to be at least a forty minute wait to check out. We didn't even get to try the food because the line for that was equally as long.

PkiEvB1IYMacCkWQzjlv7g,7M-rWYRGPfCDnb7tjl7QGQ,CxsN79g8rZoouLwZvr_FVg,4,1,1,0,"Fern is the kind of restaurant, where after finishing your meal, will say ""that was great""-- but may not necessarily crave an item enough to put the restaurant on regular lunch/dinner rotation.

I've been here a few times, and each time, service was good, and the ambiance is nice with super rustic slab wood tables, custom-made fern-filled felt wall art, and artichoke salt and pepper shakers. 

For appetizers, the squash blossoms *are* as good as everyone says.  Creamy insides, crisp outsides. Very flavorful, despite the perception vegan cheese is bland.  But since they're out of season, they'll have an alternative appetizer.  Today it was potato croquettes (sweet potato and purple potato) dipped in pesto.  These were nice, though something slightly amiss.  Perhaps, too creamy inside? Nonetheless they were piping hot and fresh from the fryer. 

We also had the soup starter featuring yellow peas (I believe...) and butternut squash.  Nice, not overly salty, had sweet flavor from onions and squash.  Only served with a piece of toasted bread the size of a postage stamp.  Because the soup isn't a hearty, creamy soup, it would have been nice to have a larger piece of crusty bread to dip. 

This Indian fry bread appetizer is of the Native American kind of fry bread, not Indian from India.  Topped with a bean chili-type mixture, tomato and cheese, it's like an all-natural puffy taco.  My only criticism, which was shared by another woman I sat across the room from, the fry bread is a bit tough.  It's hard to cut and very chewy. Flavors are good. 

The popular Om Burger was indeed good. It was mostly because the bun was nicely toasted, the burger itself was meaty in texture, and the goat cheese a nice add-on.  Quinoa salad is a nice accompanying side.  I still like the veggie burger over at 131 Main better (I've had it about 6 times...beet and brown rice based with teriyaki glaze and havarti cheese.)

The Buddah Bowl changes, and I've had it two different times.  Both times, the veggie selection is nice, the vegan sauce/veggie sauce to accompany is good too, but could use a kick.  I mean, like Nicole W. mentioned, it needs spice of some kind.

Pot Pie: Mushroom cream sauce and large chunks of summer squash, a few pieces of carrot, and chickpeas.  I really liked the flavor of this dish hot. Thick, creamy, and again, super hot. But the veggies really varied in doneness.  The carrots were kind of hard...some yellow squash was medium hard...some zucchini was well cooked, as were the mushrooms.  When I think pot pie, I also would like a real puff pastry or any kind of ""top"".  Instead, it comes with a croissant.  Not the buttery, flaky make-a-mess-on-your-lap kind, but a hybrid 30% real croissant, and 70% Pilsbury Crescent Roll.  It's more bread than a croissant.  (Look at how in-depth I'm going into the scientifics of this carbohydrate product.) It was good at sopping up the sauce, and got the job done.  Just not what I expected. 

I also wondered why the vegetables in the pot pie weren't in season, and why they were so  ununiform in size. I had giant chunks of carrots...but small chickpeas, slivers of SUMMER squash.  

I think that does it for now.  Overall, it was good.  I felt good after I ate here, and would take my friends, veggie or not.  I did head a couple diners complain to their server about waiting 40 minutes for their main entrees to arrive...and I did overhead some other diners being just so-so satisfied with their meals.  If Fern amped up the flavor just a bit, and made some minor improvements, this restaurant would be a knock out.",2012-01-07 23:28:16

Nice looking space - not a big fan of all the mirrors on the one wall but wtf do i know about restaurant design.  I dig the openness to the kitchen.

Felt a little out of place since we were in our post- work out gym clothes.  We got the sense this place is the go to lunch spot for  women shopping nearby or after having their hair and nails done.  

We shared the turkey meatball pizza ($14 ) as an app.  Meatballs were very tender, nice crust - slight crunch followed by pillow center.  Overall, very tasty.

gf went with the fried chicken sandwich.  I choose the burger.  The FC sammie came with a salad - very fresh, crunchy veggies.  The fried chicken was tender with   mustard-y cole slaw.  Could've used a little more seasoning but overall well prepared.  ( i believe $15)

The burger also needed more salt otherwise it was PERFECT.  Juicy, juicy, juicy - great flavor.  We agreed to was a better burger than the Barrymore.  Fries decent especially since they provided a side of the tomato jam for dipping. again I believe it was $15 ) 

We finished with the bread pudding ( with a carmel/toffee sauce ) - excellent ( $9) and the baked alaskan ( $10) - sadly a miss.  the Meringue was great, the cake, very dry/stale, the ice cream - very good when eaten on it's own.

Definitely worth trying again for dinner or brunch.

Everyone I know who has been to a Chipotle raved about it and suggested that I go on my next trip to the mainland.  A lot of times, people tend to overrate things and I get disappointed but let me tell you-Chipotle definitely lived up to the hype. 
 
This Chipotle is located on the outskirts of Chandler Fashion Center.  I love the fact that you can build and customize your own burritos, tacos, salad, burrito bowls and order your food on an assembly line style system.  The employees working at this Chipotle on the day that I dined in were really friendly, upbeat, and fast-paced.  They definitely needed to work quickly because their lunch line was long and never-ending but they did an excellent job of working quickly through the line and we didn't have to wait too long until it was our turn.

I give my first burrito bowl an A+.  I had:
Cilantro-Lime Rice (YUM)
Black beans
Chicken and Steak (Really good flavor and I LOVE the option to mix your meat!)
Guacamole
Cheese
Corn Salsa
Sour Cream
Lettuce

Their burrito bowls are huge and are perfect if you're hungry but can also be good for a serving of 2 if you aren't that hungry and want to share it with someone.  Their chips and salsa are also really good and are of Mexican restaurant-quality.  The chips and salsa were both fresh and addicting.  They have self-serve Coke fountain products and free refills are available.

I picked out a 2012 Jetta SE, took it for a test drive and fell in love with it! My salesman was Marty, who was very helpful. Unfortunately he (along with everyone else that worked with us) was entirely dishonest. They finally came up with a plan for me that would roll my negative equity over into the new Jetta. Even though the payment was higher than I wanted to pay, I was happy just to get out of the Audi! We did the paperwork and I drove away in my new car...

3 weeks later, the financing manager called me and said that he needed me to come in and sign MORE paperwork. I called back and spoke with MARTY, who informed me that the bank had appproved my financing and they needed me to sign off on it. Immediately I was suspiscious, since I HAD SIGNED FOR THE CAR ALREADY... 3 weeks prior.

Food here is very average.  Sumo tries to be creative and add items to their menu that other restaurants wouldn't but ... for example, they have ""spicy"" miso soup - which is literally miso soup + sriracha.  
Their torched sushi was very, very, very average and did not add to my dinner.
The best part was their sweet shrimp - this usually comes out on weekends in other restaurants; so having it on a weekday was a bonus. 
They do have scallops and octupus which are restricted for the weekends.

Their teppanyaki and cooked section was good but nothing that tops other restaurants.

Do try their sumo rolls - it looks weird but does taste good.

$28 for a average week-day meal.

I won't be back for a while just because I want to try others AYCE but I won't complain if I get dragged here with friends.",2016-01-20 18:05:51

I have to say, it's pricey for what it is, but if you want to eat well, it's worth it. I had the Kale salad with an organic Arnold Palmer (it's not on the menu--I asked them to mix it for me). Both were delicious. It's one of those places where you pay, get a number, and pick a table where they come bring your food. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They came by a few times to see if I needed anything, and even offered me free refills. I'd come back here any day to try more items on their menu, but I'd probably have to limit it to about once a week. My lunch came out to $18 the last time I was there (not quite sure how though).

We arrived for brunch to celebrate the early-alcohol bill (better than before but still a bit backward at this day and age...) and the waiter wasn't aware of the time change, plus the actual alcohol selection was limited. I tried both the brunch cocktails and they were refreshing, but actually a little light on the booze. 

The seafood paella was individually portioned which surprised me as I never see this dish available in small quantities. When it came out, it made sense, though. It was a tad bit undercooked in spots. The seafood was delish and the chorizo wasn't as bad an addition as I feared. They also were able to custom-add a poached egg or two on request. This almost made up for the undercooked bits. 

The corn fritters appetizer wasn't anything special and I wished I had more options for a spread (savory and sweet butters would have been ideal). Probably wouldn't bother with that again, to conserve my calories and tummy space for more worthy options. Only one in three of the daily dessert shooters were good--the local peaches which actually tasted/felt like apples. The mocha mousse and lemon curd were ... unpleasant. Truly. Good crust base, though.  My understanding is those flavors change regularly so no telling if you'll have a similar or completely different experience. Gamble at your own risk. It was a fun and shareable crapshoot, at least, and we giggled quite a bit at how truly astringent the lemon curd was. 

The server was friendly and made my companions feel just right, which I appreciated, but he was new to the restaurant and you could tell he just wasn't that familiar with the menu, the kitchen, and the policies. As the face of the place, this alone loses a full star for me. 

Would I return? Yes. Would I order the seafood paella again? Yes. Will that be soon? No, I think I'll make the rounds and collect some other brunch touch points first.",2017-08-18 15:58:14

We saw CafeZupas on the way and lamented not going later

The larb...too sad to even count on. Ended up taking it home, only because I dont like wasting food. Anyways, took it home and added the missing mint, extra cilantro, and roasted ground rice that every good Thai larb dish has.  I'm always weary of Thai places that are ""too-Thai "" the ambience, the servers in Thai silk dresses. In Thailand they don't even dress like that except on marriage or a special day. Definitely not at a restaurant. The tamarind/cashew shrimp was palatable.  Not sure how much tamarind was in at all, but sounded good.  I spoke Thai to the server, AFTER the food was served . I don't look Thai at all, so maybe it was my kind way of saying "" Did you really just try to serve me this?"" Usually speaking Thai to the server is a prerequisite before ordering. To let them write the order in "" Thai style for Thai person""......... 

I guess it was my fault for being served sautéed hamburger meat with minor seasonings.

One time I wanted an earlier delivery and they were able to cater to my request.

Three important things:
1. They consistently deliver an hour earlier than expected...so make sure someone is home!
2. They always include something on the house, sometimes it could be maki and sometimes it is edamame. Yay free stuff!
3. You can order from JustEat or from their website, I have tried both and for some reason...ordering from their website turned out to be cheaper (due to the tax calculation I think).

They have a lot of turnover so the fish is quite fresh. Fried foods often arrive still crispy and warm. 
I like the BC Roll, which I learnt is not at all like the BC Roll in BC as it contains scallop (in generous portions). 
Their salmon sashimi and maki are good! Big pieces and fresh. 
The party trays are also a good deal to split between friends.

Not a big fan of their tempura veggies--the batter makes me a bit nauseated after a few bites.
I don't like the spicy tuna rolls either because the tuna is all mushed up...why? 
The spicy salmon hand cone was a ripoff ($3.45) but I needed something to bump my order up to $25. It was dinky and there was wayyy too much hot sauce in the spicy mayo sauce. It ruined the taste of salmon. Poor fishy. 

All in all, it is a good choice if you need a cheap, fairly good sushi fix.",2015-10-25 19:55:08

Having visited this location once before, I was looking forward to bringing my out of town guest to the ""fun pizza restaurant near my house"".  It started out well - we were seated right away and our waitress seemed very nice.  She brought my wine quickly, and took our pizza order.  Then, things started to go downhill.  My friend's wine didn't make it to our table.  Our pizza came (delivered by someone else, not our waitress) and still no wine.  Huh?  By then my water glass was empty, and I placed it at the edge of the table hoping to be able to flag her down for a refill (and ask for the wayward wine).  Nope.  She is chatting with a few other employees at the front of the restaurant.  I can't make eye contact.  AAAAAHHHH!  So I did something kind of embarrassing - walked over to the bar with my empty glass and asked the three people standing there if I could have a refill.  Funny, right after that our waitress came back, all smiles, with my friend's wine.  Coincidence??

My family has a collective sweet tooth that craves frozen yumminess at least once a week. After a sandwich at the shop next door, my Mom said that she wanted to get some yogurt. To our delight, we walked into the store to find flavors from around the world! Polynesian Vanilla, Mexican Hot Chocolate and Japanese Black Sesame were alongside the standard favorites of Cheesecake, Strawberry and Cookies&Cream. The toppings were fresh and tasty. My Mom loves to get mochi on her yogurt; she raved about how soft the mochi was. They also have a good variety of fresh fruits, cookie and candy toppings to add to your creation. Be advised that they charge per ounce and not by the size of your cup, so your order can quickly add up.
As we placed our desserts on the scale, the lady at the register politely told us of the extended hours on the weekends (open till 12am on Fri and Sat). She was so friendly and genuinely sweet. She thanked us for coming in and even stopped by our table to chat a little. 
 
We love Yogurtland for the delicious frozen yogurt and good selection. We left with smiles because the customer service was so great that it truly made us feel special.

 If a franchise can take the time to care about the happiness of their customers, why can't every other establishment do the same?

This shop has a winning combo! Great customer service and yummy food!

This is probably the sharpest looking Thai restaurant I have ever seen. When you walk in you see nothing but ornate wood walls with some teak wood carvings hanging throughout. Everything is so clean and laid out quite well. We are greeted by a host who introduces us to our waitress who escorts us to our booth. Both are very friendly and cordial. 

Aside from a slight language barrier issue, our service was friendly and quite attentive. We never had to wait to get our drinks refilled. 

Now the food was....amazing! Freaking loved it! One of us had the shrimp tom yum (spicy 10). He is STILL talking about how good it was! Although when you order a 10, you get a 10! He was making some weird noises over there due to the spicy level of the food. lol

I ordered the combo fried rice plate. Good size portion with plenty of meat/shrimp! Very tasty! My only complaint was it was a little on the greasy side. Nothing bad, just a bit more than I would have preferred. Certainly not a deal breaker by any means.

And the other person in our party had a bowl of beef pho. LOTS and LOTS of beef in that bowl. He raved about it as well, but only said he wished the bowl was bigger to enjoy more of that flavor filled pho!

So, for the 3 of us the bill came to about 50.00. Not dirt cheap, but certainly worth what you will receive IMO. I will definitely be back to try out more of the menu!

Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.

Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.

The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.
The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.
The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.
TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. 

Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. They're still in their soft-opening phase and busy as hell. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling.

I treated myself to a low-light, brow wax, and a pedicure. Being that is was so long ago, I forgot the stylists name that did my color - she did a really good job, wasn't all that chatty (thank god) and stayed focused. 

She did a good job and I was pleased. She knew I had two other appointments, so when she saw she was running out of time (as I have a lot of hair and it sucks up color) she asked one of her fellow classmates to assist in the blow out. Great job ladies! That's what I love to see, TEAMWORK! 

So then off to my toes I went... Hmmm, well for $12 bucks I basically got a color change. There was no really pedicure anything going on here... I could tell that my manicurist could really care less as she kept looking at the cheat sheet on the wall and she acted like my dogs would bite... I'm not saying they are scary or anything.. my feet are just fine... but that is how I felt once done. I was extremely jealous of the lady next to me... she was getting her toes done up right... But nonetheless my toes looked all pretty with the great Aveda product. 

Whoosh and there I was swooped up and taken to the spa area... I keep my brows shaped as best as I can do (and I'm blessed with a great arch), so there really wasn't much for the young lady to do -- so I asked that she just clean them up... you know to get rid of all the baby hair. 

I the clean up was just ok, but I think I may have scared her when I told her not to make them thinner...

The 'Meh' of the menu. The fondu is a bit salty and is very rich.

- Beef Carpaccio - 
Thin strips of raw beef with a spring salad on top drizzled with some kind of mustard sauce with capers. WIN. 

- Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant -
Dont really like eggplant very much but OH MAN THAT SAUCE IS GOOD!!!

- Margherita Flatbread - 
Very nice, Very tasty, Could use more basil but overall it's perfect as a starter

- Shrimptini - 
Already peeled shrimp in a martini glass filled with tasty salad. Very refreshing and awesome as a starter or in between rich dishes like the shrimp and eggplant

- Sliced Steak Bruschetta -

I tried their nom nom burrito which is too good to be true seriously if you come hear you must try it. I also ordered a vanilla latte and this is the reason why I took a star off, it had a bitter taste. I even tried my friends latte and we both thought so. I can barely taste the vanilla so I was kinda disappointed in this place since people rave about their coffee. Although I did like how it was strong enough to wake you up and it didn't have a watered or too milky taste I will definitely give their latte another chance! But I will be back here for the delicious burrito.

Okay well let's make this easy and start with my favorite thing about the place, the bread. LOL it's sad how serious I am. When bringing out the water, they bring out an assortment of bread and thin crisps along with this pico de gallo sort of concoction of tomatoes, along with a side of butter. I usually hate tomatoes but that side dish was DELISH. We literally asked our server to bring more at least 4 times. 

For an appetizer, we ordered crab cakes, which pretty much tasted like something you can find in the frozen food section of Costco. We also opted for the soup of the day which was an asparagus cream. Again, you could probably find it at Costco. Salads were typical, nothing to rave about, then again it was just a Caesar so there's not a lot you can mess up there. 

As the main course, my parents went with the steak...very fatty but still good. I decided to be healthy and go with a fish dish. It was mediocre, that's all I could remember from it. 

I say, go with the shrimp scampi, my dad has brought it home before and it was okay, very cheesy and greasy though. It's not the food that has lead me to decrease my rating, it's the service. First of all, every table is given two servers, one being the main one who takes your order and serves you courses, and the other acts as their assistant, constantly making sure your glass is full or if you need any extra items. With this type of service, you would expect it to be a high class restaurant with AMAZING service, you're given two afterall! Our main server would walk by our table yelling out the status of our food, as he walked to the back or to another table. He did it several times, after the 3rd or 4th we realized he was actually talking to us. The assistant was great, we honestly wanted to sneak him the whole tip but felt like he might get some trouble from his buddy, so we decided to be fair. 

As far as the overall ambiance of this 'steak house', it felt like a Golden Corral. 

Overall, this is a nice place to have dinner...if your meal is comped by the casino.",2012-11-13 16:47:56
_cLjh-syU150pyKuHGMVYg,F-1ClQ8bSEp2T7NSnVYNRA,sPzLsm3l1eUPMzz3ZJJu_w,1,3,1,1,"Well, this place has finally made my list of worsts for 2012, and it's a crying shame that it came to that. 

What happened? Went there for lunch today with my wife, expecting the same level of service (lax at best) but at least good food that we both remembered. What did I get? Neither. 

We show up at noon on a Friday and the place was completely deserted inside, maybe a handful of tables and for a place this size, that's nuts. What happened to the lunch crowd? I should have known something was up at that point, but foolishly decided to go ahead with it and get seated. 

First up, there was no bread service. At first I didn't realize, but then I saw bread on a few tables but not at others. I figured we would get some eventually, but that didn't happen. I inquired later in the meal about this and the server explained to me that they've been cutting costs by not giving out bread unless you ask for it, even though it is free if you want it. I asked her how I would know that I now have to ask for it, when I never did before, to which she responded that she probably should have asked if I wanted it. Yeah, right, as if the management wants you to ask everybody, it's obviously the policy to not say anything and hope the customer doesn't want it. Seriously, how much do you save on the miniscule bread they serve you? A few cents per table? What an absolutely ridiculous and stupid thing to do. 

Secondly, they have a new executive chef. The server explained to me that this guy was hot stuff and his food was excellent, but the reality didn't measure up. First she botched my wife's order and brought it out covered in onions, so it had to go back. No, they didn't re-make it, they just scraped them off. Gross. Additionally, my gyro tasted dry and nowhere near as good as previous visits. The presentation was sloppy too and everything was just sort of thrown onto the plate haphazardly. The pitas were obviously store bought and heated up (badly) and were in no way fresh or in-house, which was really off-putting. 

Worse yet, they got rid of their excellent french fries and now have these disgusting, over-greased and over-salted potato wedge looking things, absolutely revolting. They tasted worse than they looked, and I'm sure that's because this is another cost-cutting measure just like the bread. 

And no, it doesn't stop there. They also eliminated my favorite appetizer as well, the Greek Wings, which used to be absolutely fantastic and one of the things I really looked forward to with this place. No substitute, it's just gone in their menu re-design. Speaking of which, they also re-designed the prices, at least for the lunch, and pushed everything up a couple of dollars, minimum. Considering the lower quality of the food and that they skimped on the bread and wiped out my favorite, beloved appetizer, I don't see how they can justify asking for more money for the mediocre garbage they churn out. 

I'm sorry, but this place is on its last legs. Empty restaurant on a Friday for lunch, bad service, ridiculous cost cutting measures, new clueless chef and updated, worse but more expensive menu? These guys are going to be out of business by the end of 2012 in my opinion, as empty restaurants on a Friday at lunchtime are not long for this world. I am not going back and I'm warning my colleagues to avoid this place as well. There are so many better options out there, even down the street, that there's no reason to put up with this kind of a joke of a restaurant. 

What a shame they've fallen to this level, they had so much potential.",2012-02-11 01:57:25

The decor is...funktastic, like a 1970's disco party.  You were definitely transported back in time, like the menu says, to how Vegas used to be.  

Even on a Monday morning, business was good.  Thankfully, there was no wait for us because we were both famished and in a hurry to get on the road.

Puzzle:  A sexy cocktail server takes your alcoholic beverage order while a more normal one (still cute, just showing less cleavage) takes your food and juice orders.  Everything ends up on the same bill anyway.  Just thought that was kind of odd. 

Food:  Pretty yummy.  Breakfast portions were generous except hubby's NY Steak and eggs was normal sized.  I got corned beef hash and eggs and realized I didn't get any hash browns with it.  However, I noodled it over and reasoned that the corned beef already had potatoes in it.  Just so used to other places giving you a side of hash browns, this sort of made sense.  
My dish was pretty greasy...rather than a patty of corned beef hash, it was bowl of mushy stuff, sitting in a lot of butter.  I did enjoy my breakfast but it got pretty salty and I tried to avoid the parts sitting butter.  Hubby said his steak was ok and eggs were well cooked.

Cool stuff:  Sugar dispenser contained multi-colored crystals which resembled those tube-like beads you used to make jewelry.  I could resist taking a teaspoonful and eating it like a kid.  Downside:  The dispenser had some crusty old gunk on it so it was a little gross to handle.

Out of all the locations I've been to, this has to be my favorite for a couple of reasons. 

1.  Free-Weights:  At this location, there's plenty of if.  Like I stated in a previous Gold's review, I love the steel plates.  Just that hollow sound of the plates banging against each other is music to my ears. 

2.  Plenty of machines and cardio.  My only issue with their cardio, the treadmills are sometimes out of order. 

3.  Location:  Not the closest Gold's to my home, but still a convenient one. I actually prefer driving the extra 8 miles to get here.  It's also close to a ton of post-workout eats, grocery shopping, BabyCakes, etc. Enough parking as well. 

4.  Clean gym with clean restrooms

5.  Ambiance:  Since the Flamingo and Sahara locations are no longer around, you'll spot the occasional figure, bikini, and bodybuilding pros working out here.  Observing their workouts is like a free seminar. 

My only gripe about this place is the lack of leg machines, specifically their leg extensions and lying leg curls.  Nothing beats free-weights, but there's still a place for machines like extensions and leg curls.  Since there's only one of each, you have to make sure that you step it up when you see it open up.

The place was not crowded on a Friday night, so there was no wait.  Great for me, probably not so much for the restaurant.  After studying the menu, I ordered their Calamari Fritti, a benchmark test I have for Italian restaurants.  The portions were larger than I had expected, and it was better than okay.

I also ordered the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (another tried and true benchmark test), which is thin flat pasta, served with mussels, clams, shrimps, and really tiny scallops in a tomato sauce with crushed red peppers, garlic and wine.

Tiramisu was how I concluded this meal and unintentionally shut down the restaurant for the night.  It was again just okay. But overall it was a pleasant dining experience, and I can see why it was popular with the more mature crowd.

Aside from that, the burgers are deeeeelicious and the ambiance is great as well. But let me start from the beginning..

I wake up to a pounding headache and not feeling too hot as a whole..you know, when the thought of eating breakfast (eggs especially) makes you want to lose it. So, when my friend invited me to venture to Zinburger, I was excited. Not about moving...but about burgers. 

While en route to the restaurant, my friend calls and tells me that they have a Bacon infused vodka bloody mary and if she wanted me to order one. Ummm...YES???? Liquid bacon plus vodka in the form of a bloody mary? Mommy daddy...yay!!!!!! 

I arrive to this delicious beverage screaming my name, a sunny spot on the patio and just a prefect/fun atmosphere. The bloody mary alone was to die for. I had to refrain from eating the glass...

On to the food..burgers...and lots of them. Not to forget the sweet potato fries and other yummies. The burgers were great. Maybe only us people, who are completely obsessed with burgers, can truly appreciate a good burger. Others should opt for McDonalds. I don't care what you say..you can taste the difference: the meat, the cheeses, the buns, the lettuce...everything.

I wish I had more time to come here as often as I did the past couple of semesters seeing as students get to use the facility for free and there are 5 levels packed of resources to keep your blood pumping.

My schedule has been running every Monday from 10-6pm and after that, I would rush home to jog around the neighborhood with my mother. On my days off, I'm volunteering, studying, attending talks and all that fun stuff, forcing me to put the gym at a lesser priority than everything else. And I'm not too happy about it. Last fall, I enjoyed working up a sweat during Zumba toning classes they held at the second floor rooms. Other times (especially during hot weather), I would arrive on campus as early as 7am to hit the treadmills and exercise bikes - then leave the gym full of endorphins which lasted me all day!

I've heard of a relaxation rooms filled with massage chairs for those of you who need to destress during finals week. There's also a swimming pool on the first floor which I have yet to use and a running track on the 4th floor, a great alternative to the treadmill. Weights are situated on the second floor as well as most classes. They go from boot camp to yoga to spin classes. Lines are minimal and hygiene has never been a problem. Tissues and sanitizers are within view and available for gym-goers to wipe down their equipment when they are done so you can at least ensure that yours are clean. 

Staff has also been really nice. They understood that I forgot to bring my own lock for the lockers this one time and allowed me to keep my duffel on the cardio floor even if it's prohibited. You guys rock! I'm hoping to put in a little more time here if I can and while I can but seeing as the weather is getting cooler, school isn't too near and my schedule is quite demanding, I will keep up with my Sunday runs and neighborhood jogs in the park for now.",2015-10-23 23:52:28

This was just the kind of mexican food we were looking for, nothing fancy about it just your basic kind that you would expect to find at a place like this. Their salsa was good, not too chunky and their cheese sauce was also delicious. My husband and I both ordered two bean burritos with cheese sauce and a side of rice and we were both pleased.

As a person who grew up in a Catholic church what's not to love?  I practically worship beer, so beer being on center stage on the altar conjures up something special when I walk through those heavy wooden doors.  I almost wish they put beer in the white marble holy water fonts to make the sign of the cross as you enter.
Now for my latest experience as it's been probably three years since I have attended church due to travels and living abroad.  
My parents were in town and my dad loves everything about the beer making process, especially the consumption part.  It was also my wife's birthday and she too loves good beer, so to the Church we went.
Everyone minus me hadn't been there before, so there was a bit of awe factor for the noobs.  Though we were all a bit disappointed with generic wreath hanging on the plexi-glass barrier guarding the altar.  I don't remember this barrier in my prior visits, a small negative, but a negative none-the-less.  
We were seated in a heavy traffic area at a small table, which we requested later to be moved to more cozy location.  This request was met graciously and as a former server I understand you have to try to seat someone in those places....
We all ordered our beers and my father requested the Sour Piet.  Much to his dismay they returned with our beers and three samples glass of beers that were not Sour Piet.  He was informed that had kicked the keg earlier, but hadn't known.  He tasted the other beers and decided to get the Thunderhop (my favorite).  We only had Thunderhops and Cherry Saisons.  Both were very good, as per usual.  Disappointing that they had run out of the Sour, and a little miffed that our server was not privy to it being gone, but again just a little negative.
We ordered two large pizzas -- The Cinco Formaggio and the Wild Boar BBQ.  Both were cooked perfectly in their amazing brick oven.  The pizzas were a bit too salty for our standards and they seemed to skimp on some of the ingredients so the balance was lost a little.  The Wild Boar was very good, but it lacked something, maybe spice or tang.  I think there was only a few slivers of the red onions on it....Again a small disappointment. 
After polishing off the majority of our pizzas my dad asked our server to fill up a 64oz growler with the Cherry Saison.  The server acted like this would be near impossible since it was a seasonal and limited brew, but said he'd try.  He returned triumphantly and bragged about how he'd done us a favor since they were out of Sour Piet.  An obvious ploy to get a little added to his tip, but again a small disappointment.
I hope you caught on to the trend of a lot of little disappointments added up to make it a good experience, but not great.  I usually go after work for beers and pizzas with friends, for this it never disappoints.  But for a special occasion with family that has higher standard it left a little to be desired.

After several visits I was still baffled by how a Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh could produce the best damn sushi and rolls I'd ever had. I spoke to the Sushi Chef and he explained everything is flown in fresh daily. Then we had colleagues from San Francisco come to town and they were blown away by Nakama's. Finally we had Japanese customers in town for a week so we awkwardly asked them out to eat ""sushi in Pittsburgh!"". After the meal they said it was the best they had experienced in the US.

Absolutely the best nightclub and venue in Las Vegas. HANDS-DOWN.

Thankfully, we did not have to wait in line (heard it was a 3 hour wait) and so our overall experience was much more pleasant than other reviewers.

Pool and cabanas with clear-glass hot tubs. HOLY SH*T AWESOME. Beautiful views of the City Center, heated lamps, and mini bars sprawled everywhere.

YES, my kind of place.

There's even a ""Lighter Side Menu"", which I chose to partake in. Lighter side choices range from lean steaks, chicken, salmon, salads, and some white fish (i.e. Mahi Mahi and Tilapia). Of course, I went with their 5 oz Filet Brio.  This was served with asparagus and sweet potato.  You can't go wrong with grilled asparagus and their sweet potato was amazing.  My only issue with both...wish I had more.  As for their 5 oz filet, I had this cooked medium-well.  In the last 2 weeks I've had steak at least 3 other times at well respected steakhouses.  No joke...I think Brio's was up there in tenderness, taste, and presentation.  My entree was less than 400 calories and a little over $20.  Bang for your buck without a bang on your nutrition!

The ambiance was great. You gotta love the tall ceilings.  Our server was great as well. I know that this is an Italian restaurant and I didn't get anything Italian.  But their steaks are good and for that alone, I am a fan.

Plenty of parking garages in the vicinity so not a far walk once parked downtown. Great restaurants nearby. 
Pricing is good, too. I love that they offer discounts to teachers. Yay! They also do student rush tickets, too I believe. 
Trust Arts gets a great selection of shows to come to Pittsburgh so you can see a great Broadway series production in your hometown or if you visit Pittsburgh. And, in that case this is something to do on your visit. 
I sat most recently in the orchestra seat which are nice. I prefer the director's circle above so you don't have to dodge a head in front of you.  I did once sit in 4th row orchestra and well, that's pretty damn awesome! 
I will always be back to this theater.",2014-12-21 14:03:36

Dairy Queen was on the way home and it had been a while since my last visit.  The inside has totally been redone.  It looks great!  Very clean with new booths and tables.  Plus they have a child area with a little table and activities.  I was pleasantly surprised.

They seem to do a good job with getting orders out quickly.  There was only one person in front of me so it didn't take long for my order to be completed.

KuhEddvqjs4cu9j-nZ3D4A,dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw,5,0,3,0,"This review is on the market itself, not really the food court. I was first led here out of simple laziness. I was invited to a bbq and Hawaii style dictates try never to show up empty handed. Being too lazy to make something, I sought out the nearest Korean market since they almost always have marinated meats. So glad I was forced to come here! 

First off, the parking lot has slanted parking spots. As anyone who's been to Chinatown knows, Asians can't reverse for sh*t. Hey I'm not as bad as some, but sadly I'm included in that generalization. It's nice to shop w out worrying about some little old lady w a minivan backing I to your car.

The store is very clean since it's still pretty new and hopefully will stay that way. They have a great selection of produce, but sadly the quality is lacking. I got super excited about a box of dinosaur egg pluots by the entrance, but every single one was overripe. 

The seafood section isn't as extensive as other Asian markets in town, and nothing live swimming in tanks. But that's usually in Chinese markets, not so much w Korean ones. 

On to my reason for being there - the meat dept! Large selection of cheap marinated meats and everything I've tried so far was great. Spicy pork isn't too fatty and has great flavor, although I don't consider it spicy at all. I usually add more garlic chili paste before cooking it. Bulgogi is pretty good, but may not be marinated long enough since flavor wasn't really set in. Same with kalbi ribs, which were also extremely fatty. Yes I know the cut is supposed to have marbling, but this was excessive. 

They also have ready to fry tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and chicken katsu. Katsu is simple to make, but creates such a mess I hate it. Awesome to have this option. They must season the meat because it has flavor even w out katsu sauce. Spicy chicken is just ok, teri chicken is flavorful and so juicy.

Their regular meat section has cuts of varying quality including some beautiful and expensive kobe beef. Next to that is a small hot and cold prepared food section. The best thing there is the beef pancake. Its a beef patty w carrots and other veggies mixed in, dipped in egg and pan fried. Its like a patty version of meat jun. Whatever it is, just get it. FYI - the label simply said beef on mine. 

Greenland has the best selection of Korean snacks, nori, instant soups. It seems to be the only place that carries my fav potato noodle soup. 

Ladies at check out are quick and friendly, although they always talk to me in Korean. I respond by staring back blankly....  

I've only tried the homemade fried mandoo at island style. Its just like my Korean aunty used to make, and love that I can also get Hawaiian sun juice w it.

This market is pretty damn awesome, but I still prefer SF market (spring mtn/decatur) for my produce, seafood and spices since Greenland is solely Korean.",2011-07-10 14:08:56

I love getting a thali.  It comes with everything you could possibly want in an Indian meal.  The South Indian special is also outstanding.  My goal is to one day be able to finish an entire thali.  Overall, good service (particularly for an Indian restaurant) and completely worth the twenty-minute drive to Monroeville.  Eating at Udipi helps me to understand why the vegetables are so good you don't miss the meat.  Also, good water service, which is nice considering the spice levels are not oriented to the American palate.

That said I avoid this one when possible but today I had a craving after not having had it for a long while. I figured the retraining chipotle closed for yesterday would have made for some improvements. To her credit the girl greeted with a smile but I didn't make it past the beans. Ordered a burrito with black beans and to my dismay there was chicken and residue in them. I pointed it out and she offered to make new beans. Now call me picky but after all the fuss lately I decided that might be a good idea and keeps them vegetarian friendly. She said it'll be awhile and I said okay and stood there, awkwardly. She didn't suggest how long and that I might have a seat nor offer me a drink or chips while I wait. Neither did the manager who was sitting at a table towards the door think to chime in. Apparently the stove wasn't even on so I assume they still have to heat it, prep the beans and cook them. Made me wonder when all the previous food out was made if the grills weren't even hot. I sat down and after a few minutes the beans weren't out the back yet so I got up and left as the hangry set in. So to sum it up I feel they could be more careful with there food and more thoughtful when a problem arise especially since I was the only one at all in line. Maybe I'll try a chipotle again in a couple months.",2016-01-20 01:21:37

It's cool because you can still order breakfast for lunch if you feel like it! I had a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel and my hubby had the BLT sandwich with fries. It was good and the salmon portion was very generous! I usually have never enough because I really love that, but hubby finished my plate given the mountain of salmon they gave me! I really cannot complain about the food! 
Service, on another hand, was a bit below average as I had to ask 4 times for water and the waitress seemed to always forget. In this very hot day, I understand we might be less patient to get served water, but I'm fairly certain that this simple task could be done under 15 minutes!

UPDATE! Tried to give them a second chance today and the lady was extremely rude AGAIN!
We tried sitting on the patio in the shade (as I'm pregnant and burn in seconds!) and she ordered us to sit on a table in the sun because those 4 tables were apparently taken. We thought it was weird at 11am on a Monday lunch. We would have stayed like 20-30 mins for a quick lunch.

Tuesday 9/19, I went in and bought the bed I'd tried a few times, also bought a bench. My sales person JR, filled out a sales order and gave it to the clerk for me to pay. I paid just over $2200.  Bed to be delivered next day. They gave me a copy of sales order with my receipt. 

Next day deliverers showed up and were great! Super efficient and nice. Set everything up quickly. The bed didn't feel as soft as the store but I figured it was just unwrapped and maybe it needed to ""fluff up"" a bit. Nope

This is now the following day. My husband and I slept so poorly, we were up most of the night. This bed is firm with a pillow top. Don't know where the error occurred: the facility, the wrong sku... no clue but this is NOT WHAT WE ORDERED! 

So, while I was up most of the night I looked at the invoice, still not sure about the sku but I realized our salesman added a mattress protector for $109.99 without asking me or discussing this. Merely adding a hidden additional expense is stealing to me. 

Oddly, when the delivery guy handed it to me I thought this was so cool, they tossed in a thank you gift!! Nope. 

I've sent a message to our salesman to remedy this situation  and will update this review as I go along. But clearly, at this point I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BUSINESS! But 5 star express delivery gets a 5!


Update: I returned the mattress cover and was refunded my money. I was very clear I felt this was stealing and not happy about it. Additionally, manager was very eager to rectify the mattress situation and the mattress is to be changed out on Friday this week (only because I am out of town). I sat on the replacement bed at the warehouse and while it's nowhere near as soft as floor model it is significantly softer than the previously delivered one. So, while I am thinking about it, I'd recommend people buy their mattresses from a bed store. The selection would be greater and I'd anticipate fewer issues. Update will continue once I'm back in town and receive my bed.

Saga continues!! OM gosh... new bed delivered. What was ordered was a K-PPT Huntington extra soft. Delivered just now was a replacement a Chesapeake Bay luxury firm.  Grrrrr. The movers asked if the could just leave it here instead of changing it out again and let customer service deal with it. At this point I just want my money back and they can take it all!!

Update, they finally picked up the bed and accessories, returned my $, except for the shipping charge. I demanded that as well, since they shipped the wrong items. I bought a bed from a bed store and am super happy now.",2017-09-21 15:13:45

You need and then put the seat down.  I thought that was awesome!  

One thing I can say about the food is PORTION! Wow, do you get a pile of food here.  I ordered the .38 special omelet.  It had all the meats in it.  My Wife ordered the egg scramble.

Oh, and they have VEGAN OPTIONS. How rare is that? Yes, I said VEGAN! 

Second, the place is cozy and friendly and the staff are very welcoming and are patient every time I take up to five minutes to make my final pie slice decision.

A must item are the pot stickers, you get 8 to an order and they are huge monster size and could easily be a meal by itself.

Must item 1A - The fried fish fillet is also very good and has a nice minor kick to it but is not spicy but good and flavorful.

There are quite a bit of choices for noodles which are freshly made on the spot and good entertainment. You can get thin, thick, regular, flat thin, flat thick. I like the normal or thin, the thick is too much for me.

We had the #22 and the #19 Noodle dishes, the #19 was the Seafood with an Alfredo style sauce which was a bit thick and just okay sauce. 

Would recommend the #22 Noodles with Minched Pork which has good Sauce.

We also ordered the green beans which came out as a huge serving and were pretty good. 

Keep in mind this is a no frills place so come for the food not the decor and the service is pretty good. 

Glad we gave it a 2nd try and will be back again",2015-06-23 00:02:55

I'm not sure if it's management and staff changes, or if it's the new Dos Gringos that opened up next door, but something about Mack's just isn't fun anymore.  

Service: Spotty at best - if you can find a server when they are busy, they make you feel as if you should be apologizing to them for bothering them.  They are great about clearing empty bottles and glasses of the table, but try to get a fresh drink - you are better off wading through the crowd and going to the bar.

Food:  The food is still good, but again, the service isn't - so unless you are ok with cooling food and waiting for a while, it's not really worth it.  

Crowd:  Not sure what happened here, but the douche bag to human ratio has spiraled out of proportion.  It was always a biker type place, with plenty of normal people mixed in.

I'd probably give it closer to a 2.5 but overall it was a decent experience.

The food and portions are actually quite good, however a bit overpriced for what you get and compared to other similar restaurants. Service was lacking, friendly but really slow and the restaurant is decent, nothing special. 

I went with the two skewer chicken shish kabob dinner, hoping for leftovers for lunch the next day and it was around $22, plus I upgraded the salad for $2 to one of their specialty salads, the avocado spinach salad which was fresh tasting and loaded with goats cheese, avocado and strawberry, the portion was good for a starter salad. We then waited for probably over 30 minutes for our main dishes to come. In between that time, we actually had a server come out to try to give us our salads again, it seems that our order was duplicated for whatever reason. Finally after asking the waitress where our food was, it came. The portion, again was large for the chicken; I did get my leftovers! The rice was a small portion, which is strange as it's the cheapest part of the meal and it was sprinkled in some sort of sour spice (sumac?) and almonds or nuts. I'm not sure i'm a fan of nuts on my rice, I also wonder about people with allergies as it's not mentioned on the menu. This might be something to add to the menu or alerted to customers. On the plus side, the chicken was all white meat, tender and delicious. We also tried the fried eggplant salad which comes with pita, the pita was actually a bit stale tasting, maybe it was over toasted and the eggplant was decent but sweeter than I'm used to. 

On a Sunday night there was a bit of a wait, it seems to be a popular spot among the neighbourhood. The service wasn't great, our waitress seemed flustered and uncommunicative when our food was taking so long to come out, and other tables were getting their food before us even though we had ordered earlier. We were double served our salads and she just seemed really confused when we told her we had already gotten and finished our salads about 15 minutes earlier.

The restaurant is casual and clean but not all that notable. The tables are quite close together but it's not overly crowded feeling. We were sitting near the entrance which might get uncomfortable if there are lots of people waiting for a table.  

I think i'd prefer choices like Sofra or Me Va Me for this type of food, it's a few dollars cheaper and I find the food and service to be a bit better. Definitely not worth the $120 or so for 4 people.",2017-06-28 17:52:09

The ricotta cheese option makes this particular pizza stand out from others. They give the kids some dough to play with to pass the time, and there's an observation window in the back for them to watch the pizzas being made. Score!

The decor is pretty cool with wine bottles for pendant lights at the bar area and hanging from the ceilings. It's a very ""New York"" vibe with old signage from the original grimaldis. 

I love eating outside, so it's a big draw to me when restaurants have that as an option.

Back when I was a wee little lad, just started working, we would go and wait in line to get a huge burrito in Millbrae, CA. Home of the original Super Burrito store. I mean, this thing was huge, spicy and we would have to take a nap afterwards!

Fast forward to living in LV, I passed by this place several times and did not think it was the same as the California Chain. Then, I saw the signs, read up on this place on yelp and had to give it a shot!

1.  Location - Easy to get in and out of at a strip mall on the northeast corner of Pebble and Eastern.

2.  Ambiance - Clean and simple. Plenty of tables for eat in. You order at the counter. Signs of home sweet home SF and the Bridge! Yeah!

3.  Food - This is a cook to order place, so it is not like all the meat is in a warmer waiting for you, so timing wise, it will take a few minutes.

- Carne Asada Burrito 
- Chicken Burrito
- Carnitas Burrito
- Cheese Quesidilla

All above were pretty awesome. We ordered it as they prepare it, without the rice. Still very tasty.  Now this thing is not power packed like other places. No, it is wrapped nice and tight and has all the right amount of meat and stuff. This makes it easier to eat and to taste the meat.  All the meat was tender and juicy!

We have been getting used to the huge oversized burritos of late, however, the issue is that they fall apart and it is difficult to eat and enjoy it properly. We end up having to use fork an knife and to me that negates the experience and joy of eating a burrito with your hands!

The soup was udon noodle, simmered in an vegetable broth with fried tofu, mushrooms, broccoli, crispy soy fritters, carrots and vegetables. Not very delicious and again a bit expensive for the size of the dish.

Last week, I went for dinner and the food was inexcusable. The cheese curds were very greasy and almost all breading (no cheese). A friend and I got the sustain-a-burger and it was one of the worst burgers I had in a while. Not sure if they are getting complaisant or it was just a fluke, but I've lost all confidence in the Great Dane's food.",2015-05-27 17:43:18

But I do have a friend who has been helping out.  He actually is willing to work for some pizza and a Dr. Pepper.  As payment, I brought him to Bistro Pizza.  I saw the strong Yelp reviews as well as the offer for free order of garlic knots with a Yelp check-in.  It was on at that point.

This is some good pizza made with quality fresh ingredients.  Each pizza is made to order and 100% customizeable.  There are no cookie cutter prefab options here.  We ordered a large pizza with sausage, green bell pepper, mushroom and olives.  Plus the garlic knots with my check-in, of course.  

The knots were out first.  They were still slightly doughy inside which we both agreed was perfect.  They were buttery and slightly garlicy.  The big punch of garlic came from the chunks of fresh garlic in the marinara.  Everything about it was great.  And to make it better, there were six knots of comparible size.  Each of us got 3 and neither felt cheated.

When the pizza arrived a few minutes later and shortly after finishing our knots, I was shocked by how heavy handed this place is on the toppings.  It was nearly impossible to eat this pizza with out a fork and knife.  The full coverage of cheese.  The fresh mushrooms and bell peppers.  The ground mild Italian sausage.  All of it was perfect and not skimpy in the least.  There were so many toppings I was starting to feel full after just 2 slices.  I ended up taking a couple of slices home. I had some family come in from out of town later that day and they enjoyed a slice.  I had the final slice a day later.  It was just as good reheated.

The overall feel of Bistro Pizza is not one of high class.  This is a little pizza joint that doesn't pretend to be anything more.  There is paper and crayons on each table for some simple entertainment as you wait for your food.  The walls along the counter and pizza making station are lined with drawings from past customers.  You really get the impression that the staff here care for their customers.  They display their art work and they joke around with you.  It feels like old friends just hanging out when you come in here.

We got the gnocco fritto to start based on the barmaid's recommendation. It's basically three pieces of warm, fried dough with toppings on the side. The dough was like  an unsweetened donut but in the shape of an eggroll. It's empty inside. Next to it was a meat that was similar to a thick salami and then another meat similar to prosciutto, and then marinated eggplant. It was very good. You can put all the stuff inside the dough. 

Then we had the diavolo pizza. It was a bit long for them to make it but it was worth the wait. The barmaid recommended the mushroom pizza and the margarita pizza but we wanted something with meat on it. The diavolo pizza has pepperoni, tomatoes, chili peppers, and mozzarella di bufala. I added spicy oil to make it even spicier. I paired it with a montepulciano d'abruzzo red wine. It was super dry but once it was aerated it was so good! 

Mmm i will definitely be going back! 

I like the vibe and the decorations. There's a white brick wall and a marble looking bar. It was very zen. 


***review update ***

My friends and I went on Saturday night. We ordered the diavola again because we liked it so much last time. I ordered the Jimmy Conway. It was good but I still preferred the diavola. The jimmy Conway had salsiccia, rapini and provolone. My friend had the fun guy pizza and I tried a slice. It was bland and I do not recommend it. Another friend ordered tagliatelle and he loved it. The only negative thing he had to say is that the portion was too small but he has a slice of pizza and was fine after. 

We all ordered coffee to stay awake because we were so tired and I totally regretted it because it was the worst coffee I've ever had. It was fruity and acidic. It was too weird for me. The Americano and espresso tasted the same. Some of us ordered the ice cream - hazelnut, pistachio and lemon. The pistachio was so good! Another friend had the canolli and he didn't like the filling because he found it tasted fruity. 

This is a dimly lit, loud resto good for a night out with friends or even for a date. Basically come here for the pizza and pasta. The salads looked good and the portions were huge but I didn't want to order salad on a Saturday night lol. If you really want dessert get the pistachio ice cream and do NOT get coffee!",2018-09-17 02:46:36

My first time here a couple years ago was a bad experience, but the couple times after since I've gone they've been really good. 

At first I was going to get an egg dish and get a pancake on the side but the pancake was FOUR DOLLARS. FOUR DOLLARS FOR ONE PANCAKE. AND NOT EVEN A BIG PANCAKE, JUST A NORMAL SIZED PANCAKE. lol, ya'll are funny.


So instead, I got the pancake flight this time around and it was such a good decision. Three pancakes, three different flavors, so yum. I was only not feeling the pumpkin pancake, so I wish I would have gotten a different kind. BUT they had their pancake of the day which had chocolate and pomegranate and it was probably one of the best flavored pancakes I've ever eaten. I definitely suggest getting this flight if you can't choose from their selection.

A waitress looked at me and walked right on past to to say hi to the bartender then walked away. Um hello, greet your patrons!

The food...
*Bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar: nothing special. 
*Panko-Crusted Lump Crab with Chardonnay Cream, Roasted Corn: This came out luke warm and we tasted more fried panko crust than crab meat. 
*Roasted Chicken Breast with Asiago-Pine Nut Crust, Chardonnay Cream Sauce, Ham-Corn-Bacon Risotto: I thought the chicken was cooked perfectly with a crispy crust and juicy meat. Loved the sauce with it as well. The risotto was a bit hard and the green beans that were served were almost raw. 
*Crab-Stuffed Salmon with Lemon Cream Sauce, Pesto Risotto, Grilled Asparagus: The asparagus was the best part of this dish. The rest was boring and a better version could be made at home. 
*White Chocolate and Vanilla Crème Brûlée: Break through the sugar crust that tasted like propane to find flakes of vanilla settled at the bottom of cold custard. I ate it, but I've definitely had better from the frozen food's section at Target.

$12.99 per person, no 1/2 price for kids. The buffet is small with 6 stations-salad,dessert,asian,southern,carving station and mexican.
 It is way limited too with like 6-8 items per station and nothing special.

The best thing was not having to wait but that also meant they kept food out way too long and alot of items were dried out from being under a heat lamp for too long.

I don't understand why chinese food is made in advance anyways-everything is freakin chicken & cooks in a WOK in like 60 seconds! 

Wouldn't that add some flare & get people coming back. To me everything looked dried out,pastey sauces and just ""NOT going on my plate even for a picture at a buffet BAD!""

The majority of the stations were just like that-Food that had been sitting way too long.

I stuck to the soup,salad and desserts but did have some decent ribs, really good medium-rare prime rib and I liked the cream spinach.

Strange thing about the salad bar-they had to have an attendant because it was too far to reach behind the sneeze guard to get to the items. WEIRD!

The 2 best things were the SERVICE & NO line. We never once had to wait on drinks and the napkins & handy wipes were plentiful.

If you dont like waiting in a line-are good with soup & salad, some prime-rib for $13 give it a go, otherwise it's just average at best.",2009-06-14 21:02:02

 As fly by night Halloween stores  start popping up all over the valley, the contrast to this store is especially stark. If I had to sum up the difference in one word I would say- quality. There's also selection, great array of masks and accessories, novelty gifts and a fluffy black cat keeping watch over it all. 

 My daughter immediately started drooling over a furry fox mask, so I had to take note and remind her that birthday is just around the corner. 

 There is also a selection of decor, wigs, great novelty hat section. 
 
 Fitting room doors have a cool coffin design- these guys clearly take their business seriously! 

 The one thing that stumbled me was a sign on the door that said no one under 16 is allowed without an adult. I had my kids with me and was immediately confused by a combination of this stern warning and pictures of five year olds sporting Disney princess costumes in the window. I sort of poked my head in, didn't see anything more offensive than very well developed mannequins sporting someone's school girl fantasy outfits, and charged in. I think the only risqué item I spotted were ""boob"" and um, yeah, costumes in the corner, but very tame compared with Spencer's gifts.

The place is easy to find, smack dab in the middle of Little Italy, and I really dig not only the fact that the theater has 1 screen, but also that they seem to cater to us diehard fans of indy and art house cinema. At the very least, that strategy should keep out a lot of riff-raff.

Once you buy your ticket, you go into their lovely lobby area to wait until just before the screening starts. We were also warned that the film will begin very quickly after being allowed in to sit, so if we needed to relieve ourselves, it's ideal to do it before getting seated.
The pre-screening tinkle room is pretty standard. I was pleased to see the John Wayne 'Standing Tall' urinals in use at this place, and utilized that thing like a boss.

The popcorn is another department in which the Royal can hold its head up high. Perfect! 

The theater itself takes you back to the glory days when your biggest concern in choosing a seat wasn't to avoid cell-phone talkers or annoying douche-canoe teenagers, but rather the height of the gentlemen seated in front of you. Granted, this theater is sloped enough to probably not be an issue, but it reminded me just the same. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that the seats weren't run-down relics of many movie moons ago, but seemed pretty fresh and comfortable. The screen and acoustics are also perfectly acceptable.

I sampled the mimosa trio (10 dollars) and even that was lovely and refreshing. all the flavors were wonderful and something i would go back for.
so far I have had the caprese and had to stop myself from going into a food coma. the tomatoes tasted extra fresh and the amount of pesto was perfect so it didn't take away the flavor or the tomatoes or the fresh mozzarella. it also came with a side of watermelon. yums! the rosarito was another one i had tried and holy goodness. chorizo and guacamole and scrambled eggs and cheese! be still my little foodie heart. both were under 8 dollars and again something i would make a special trip for.

Menu a little confusing, but with the help of staff figured it out... The food displayed looked like it had been there for a while... Ordered Mandarin Pork (which they made fresh), Teriyaki Chicken, Walnut Shrimp (not fresh) They only had 2 choices of Dim Sum, otherwise they would have to make some...so tried Chicken and Pork/Shrimp.. They didn't have any teriyaki sauce, so they made some fresh.. Price $24 for two to go..about double everywhere else.. Food - ok. Dim Sum must have been sitting in steamer tray for long time..mushy and watery.
Two people walked in while i was waiting..looked at food display and left.. Without heavy volume, the Panda Express Style service will not work.. They need to rethink it and cook Chinese fast food wok style..to order.

The parking there continues to be a nightmare. Not sure why they chose this location but if you don't go super early or super late, you will play hell trying to park.  The food we ordered was tasty like always and the serving was good sized. HOWEVER, a manager or someone in a position of authority, really needs to walk the dining area and move the high school crowd outside who are only having a soda. We sat at a table close to them and the profanity they were spewing was outrageous and they were quite loud. I looked around many times, hoping a staff member would notice and re-direct them, but to no avail. I actually saw one couple who sat down by them move to the other side of the dining room. I'm sure it was because of the X-rated filth coming out of their mouths.  It was like a low rent version of the cast of ""GLEE"" without manners or boundaries. It was enough that we ate quickly and left. I would have enjoyed staying longer and maybe even having another glass of wine, but not with that crowd ruining the experience. This place is nice and can really be a good dining experience, but someone really needs to monitor the high school kids. If I had brought my grandchildren along, I would have certainly sought out a manager and demanded they be made to leave. Not cool Pei Wei.

I've been here twice.  Both times we had bottle reservations.  I highly recommend that with every club so that you have dedicated real estate for the entire evening.

Don't come here if you are prude and conservative.  The Act is intended to induce you with all of the sins that the city is known for.  From the decor, costumes, and ""acts""... it's only obvious that you should expect debauchery at it's finest. 

The music here is perfect to my liking.  It's open format which is a mix of EDM, Top-40, and Hip-Hop.  All of which I personally love.  The atmosphere is sexy and the crowd is mixed.  You'll see all types and age ranges here.   The Act is still so new that it is still trying to draw the right crowd and create its character.

It's a split-level club that navigates your focus to a main room that has two stages.  The main stage hosts the majority of the ""acts"" while the smaller stage in the middle is a pseudo performance and dance area.  The club itself isn't that big and the windy halls are confusing to navigate at times.  That and crowd (at times) are my only gripes, yet they are small ones.  The performances are entertaining and a nice change of pace between DJ sets.  Overall it's one of my favorite new hot spots.",2013-01-05 21:58:16

All of our dinners included a free soup and salad bar, which my daughter and I both took advantage of.  The fresh veggies make for a very good salad.  I should come here just for this!

I ordered chicken marsala and my daughter ordered a sirloin steak.  She said her steak was just okay.  It wasn't seasoned very much, but it was cooked medium, like we asked.  My son's perogis were filled with a fluffy cheese instead of cheese and potato like we were expecting.  He took one bite and didn't want another.  The kids' favorite item was the french fries.

Coat check was provided which was nice, and we were quickly seated at one of the tables in the very back which seemed reserved for those who made reservations. I could be wrong.

Upon being seated, we were immediately asked what we wanted to drink. When asked for sparkling water, we were given a choice between traditional bottled or in-house made sparkling water. Hubby left the choice up to me, so I chose traditional bottled and we were given Eska Sparkling Water.

Immediately upon ordering, we were brought warm bread and salted butter. Not too long after, our appetizers were brought to us. Little did we know how surprised we would be!

It was my first time having cold foie gras, and after trying it, now I know that I prefer my foie gras cooked hot. However, it was a great experience trying it, and when the foie gras was tasted with all the other ingredients of the dish together, it was tremendously well balanced, full of flavour and texture. There was no WOW factor, but that's only because I personally don't like cold foie gras. When eaten together with the apple, cranberry puree and honey, the taste of the foie gras was balanced out well, and the almonds provided the crunchy texture opposite of the foie gras. Overall, I enjoyed my appetizer and would recommend it to others that enjoy foie gras. I don't think I would personally order it again, but that's only because I want to try other appetizers on the menu!

Their desserts were phenomenal! The profiteroles were extremely delicate and not overly sweet! The vanilla ice cream was very smooth and surprisingly the least sweetest thing on the plate. I'm not sure what the cream inside the profiterole is specifically, but I do know that it was extremely tasty. Along with the caramel and hazelnut nougatine, it tasted heavenly! Graham's 10 Years Tawny Port, which I sadly don't have a picture of, tasted really good, very rich in flavour and had a long-lasting finish. The wine was great on its own, but also tasted just as well with the profiteroles.

The lemon tart ended up being one of the best desserts I had ever tried in my life so far, and I would definitely go back to Laloux just to have this dessert! It was that good. What I liked the most about this dessert was their incredible creativity; I mean, have you ever had pepper in your sorbet? Or rosemary in your marshmallows? These ingredients completely blew my mind and I definitely had my WOW factor moment when I tried my dessert. Overall, I would definitely recommend this dessert, and I would probably come back to Restaurant Laloux for seconds, thirds, and fourths of this dessert! I hope they don't take it off the menu because I would definitely want to try it again with the dessert wine pairing!

By the time we were leaving, the restaurant was full of customers and it was very busy. Our trip to Restaurant Laloux was an enjoyable one, and we left with our minds preparing for our second visit. Personally, I would love to try their bar next time and experience their Menu Entr'acte, 2 appetizers and a dessert for $20! I just checked their menu, and the lemon tart is on their dessert selection.",2015-05-15 07:21:51

Service is more on par with a diner, with friendly older ladies who exceed your expectations and call you variations of ""honey"" and ""sweetie"" every time they come by to check on you.

Food is delicious and affordable:
$4 app of beer-battered brats with spicy mustard is A+
Wings can be ordered in increments of 6, but only one sauce for 6 and 12 piece orders- if you want multiple flavors, just order multiple 6-pieces. Both ranch and bleu cheese dressing available, sauce variety has about ten types from mild to hot, extra spicy, lime, garlic, and blackened- their specialty.
The burgers though, are probably a highlight: just under $6 to build your own with the basics, adding on a few charges for add-ons like guac, grilled mushrooms, and jalapenos. Grilled and fresh onions are both free, found it odd that tomatoes were a fifty-cent charge.

To fit in in the iconic Strip District, a shop has got to have that perfect Timeless Vibe: Nothing too ritzy works well here (unless you count Cavo); It's all about getting a dose of the Good Old Days. From cheese counters where you pull a number and squeeze your way up to the front to outdoors veggie stands, the Strip is never TOO modern.

To rise to this standard, Allegheny Coffee and Tea Exchange provides a rustic yet sophisticated aesthetic, somewhere between a Spice Trader Shop and a Barrelhouse. Possibly because of the big barrels... Lining the walls and filling the center of the shop are barrels loaded with delightful smelling coffee beans in almost every flavor you can imagine, from traditional Guatemalan and Columbian beans to the less ordinary, a la Jalepeno Coconut or Apricot Creme.
My favorite of all time, which keeps me coming in, is the Autumn Blend. It is SPECTACULAR. And since they make the blends in-house, I can ask for it in Spring and not be let down!

The blended drink offerings are always superb too. A crowd favorite is the Lavender French Vanilla Latte, which is great. And you can't go wrong with their Pumpkin-y drinks (is my Basic showing?)

Last but not least: Let's talk about Nitro Coffee. Coffee served from a tap, Cold-Brew Draft Coffee. Because coffee is great and beer is great and they're pretty much interchangeable... Okay, maybe not. But Nitro Coffee is amazing! My growler filled with Cardamomma Mia or Kona Storm never stays full for long.

To sum it up, Allegheny Coffee & Tea Exchange is a lovely place to stop in to during your Strip District adventures, so grab your loafers and walk on in!",2017-10-02 21:36:06

I came with a bachelorette party and had been talking this place up to my friends, but our experience in the restaurant was far less superior than my visits to the bar/lounge area.

Everyone else claims it's the best ramen in Las Vegas, maybe, but I haven't been to enough places around to say for certain just yet. So far it's a no for me, because of the way I get sick.


Growing up in Japan with a Chinese family, I know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy the noodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which I hate, they have to be consistant! And on top of that I can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone. 

So like I said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking. I always get gyoza with my ramen and would feel weird if I didn't! Something I've done since I was a little child, besides the pair together taste great! 

The soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes I feel it's a bit salty (maybe my Asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. Also depends on the one you want, I'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). The noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though I like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. People like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in Japan do), but like I said hit and miss usually it's okay. 

Outside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, green onions, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! They also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.

Overall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in Japan. My only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time I've eaten it and since I've stopped it's been okay.",2014-01-01 00:36:08

I've had the pleasure of stopping by many early Saturday mornings and tried the punchy Espresso, the smooth Macchiato and my favorite, a creamy and frothy Latté! Annie the friendly Barista explains to me that the secret of the thick and rich foam is to carefuly warm up cold milk to its desired temperature, layer by layer, and not to rush it. As for the perfect espresso shot, you have to get the timing right. Too fast and coffee will be too light. Too long and coffee will taste burnt.

Hostess: Before we arrived we had called to see if they had availability for 6 guests. Luckily for us they did. When we arrived we ultimately ended up sitting at the bar and I went back to let the hostess know that we didn't need the table anymore. Most hostesses I know would be more than happy to move onto the next guests waiting for a table but this hostess made sure we were ok and double checked if we really wanted to give up our table. I appreciated the gesture.

Cocktail Server: Since we decided to eat in the bar we grabbed a high top table along the window. Unfortunately this table only fit 2 guests at a time while one guests stood. We decided to make due whilst we waited for 6 seats to open up at the bar. The cocktail server made her way over to the table and we ordered soups and salads and a few plates of sushi. Service wasn't too bad with her and I can honestly say she did a great job considering how busy she was.

Bartender (Asian Guy) Before we ordered food from our server we tried to get the attention of the bartender. His attitude was pretty shitty for the most part. He honestly acted like he didn't really give a shit. And for me I take notice of everything

Since happy hour had not ended we wanted to take advantage of the $5 martinis. I ordered a Mango Tango which tasted more like fruit punch and vodka. I was a less than impressed plus he charged me the full price of 9 or 10 bucks. Learn your happy hour deals dude! 

After the ""martini"" we decided to order a bottle of champagne from d check this I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in the entire establishment to order champagne.and honly had 1 champagne flute for a group of 6. One champagne flute and 5 water glasses. Are you for real? This is the epitome of ghetto. Working in the industry if you need 6 flutes you better pull 6 flutes out of your ass.

This humble dining room sets the standard for good service. I was awestruck by the great attitude, work ethic, and skill of these amazing servers. How they manage to be cheerful on top of all that work is beyond me. This restaurant must have a world-class manager to assemble such a great team. They've forgotten more about good service than most culinary employees will ever know.

The high point: They clear the used dishes without making a sound! No passive aggressive busboys slamming dishes into a tub.  The servers bus their own tables and they clearly make diner comfort a top priority. 

I wish I could say the food was better, but it wasn't bad.  Among three critics, there was one thumbs up and two thumbs sideways. 

My Ruben sandwich was pretty good except it was soggy.  I guess they slopped on the sauerkraut without draining it.  When I picked the potato salad I had a hunch it wouldn't be good and I was right. Potato salad seems to be a great challenge for most eateries. (The dab I sampled at Jerry's Famous is an exception.) The pickle was just an ordinary one from the restaurant supply. 

Another critic had spaghetti with meat sauce, which he described a pretty bland. It came with garlic toast that was more like French toast, he said.

Our third critic had beef broccoli from the Chinese menu.  She was very happy with it, saying ""The broccoli was just right.""  I tried a sample but didn't care for it. It wasn't even as good as Panda.  Her vote moved the food rating up to three stars.

Judging by the steady stream of customers (including families with kids), I would say that the food here must be good enough.

It's a spacious, well-lighted restaurant. I guess the new smoking laws make it smoke-free.  Ventilation is good enough that you don't suffer from fumes drifting over from the casino.

I'm not a frequenter of casinos, so I could be wrong, but South Point seemed packed for a Monday evening. Are these neighborhood casinos usually this busy?

I came in and was expecting a lot more I have to say. There wasn't a lot of variety in coffee drinks, and I was under the presumption that they had an actual menu, like soups and sandwiches. Instead, they had a one page list of around 3 sandwiches and a soup of the day. I get it, they're small, but after all I have heard about them, I was a little surprised. So I ordered a mocha. The barista was very nice and very polite.

But, I downgrade it to 3 because the care taken in preparing the food (and serving it) did not quite match what I would normally expect from an upscale restaurant like this. We had a very good experience with the scenery and the interior (and our conversation), but it could have been great if Le Mont went the extra mile and put in 100% effort into ingredients instead of building a foundation on iceberg lettuce. The food was basically average, not distinctive, and subpar at times. 

I have always been hesitant to try Le Mont (for the almost 3 years I have been in Pgh) due to somewhat mixed reviews, my fascination with the nearby Isabela which I always thought would be very hard to beat in romance, views, and relatively casual elegance, and, all right I will say it, the ""old money"" hunch I had of the place.  This hesitation was overcome last week when I wanted to treat some distinguished overseas visitors at a nice Mt. Washington eatery -- what place is better than Mt. Washington on a clear day to initiate an out-of-towner to Pittsburgh?

Le Mont is greatly successful in impressing visitors in two ways: outstanding scenery of the city and exquisitely decorated interiors. Sit at a table next to the window and enjoy the view both outside and inside. Deserves 5 stars easily for this. But that is 5 stars just for being at the right location at the right time. A great restaurant should do much more than that. 

The food and service are another story. From an upscale restaurant like Le Mont, I would have expected elegance in the food and ingredients that go into the food. The food was tasty, but it was lacking the fine care that is a staple of *great* restaurants. Let me explain. 

We ordered three appetizers: shrimp cocktail, crepes fontinia, and the oysters. Oysters were subpar, shrimp was not high quality and was served with iceberg like lettuce, crepes were just OK. Nothing was distinctive in the three dishes. The bottle of wine we got was very good, which made me somewhat forget, albeit temporarily, that the appetizers were average. The bread and butter were OK, but only with the cabernet my visitor chose. 

My swordfish entree was the best food I had, and it was actually good. The steak looked good, but I cannot vouch for it. A visitor had bouillabaise, which looked less soupy than what I think it is supposed to be, but he thought it was fine (maybe he was being polite).  

We did go all the way in and got desserts and coffee. I liked the carrot cake with cappuccino, but again nothing was really distinctive. 

Our main server, a gentleman who was clearly seasoned and confident in the art of waiting tables, was somewhat odd. He seemed he was always in a rush and was rough around the edges. I actually appreciated his experience and confidence (and even what could have been perceived as roughness), but I did not care much for the somewhat quick and rough service. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the service; it was fun, but I will for sure not call it elegant. 

To summarize:
+ Outstanding scenery and interiors
+ Good wine
- Average food, not necessarily prepared with great care
o Fun yet not-so-elegant service

Le Mont, thus, has great potential to improve and become an very good restaurant instead of an average one. I will probably give it another try at some point, but I would not take a date I am excited about to Le Mont.",2011-08-07 01:32:58

     The strange fortune for Julio's Barrio is that they somehow maintained the primary demographic which used to be a 'lock' for Red Robin (IE 18-20something, television-oriented, going to the place as an excuse to have fun with friends instead of choosing Julio's because of the quality). That said, Julio's pulls off the bait and switch in spades -- this place looks as though you may have the best time of your life here (see: Pied Pickle commercials from the 1980's). If you get hammered quickly, the night may (later) seem to have been fun. But then you remember how much you spent, and what you got in exchange...
     The burrito was huge, and cold. The accompanying salsa was straight-outta-jar (really?) as was the guacamole. The beans were precooked (perhaps prepackaged as 're-fried'?) and the 'greens' were industry standard 'shred'. Sigh.
     I really empathized with the staff, as they did their jobs well, yet one could tell that they knew exactly what they were a part of, and as such did not give anymore energy to the job as was required.
     So: no mitigating factors at Julio's Barrio -- unless you are wealthy. Then get 15 friends to meet you there, and use the space as for a debauched party. The management group will enable your behaviour, as long as you pay for it.",2011-12-04 21:25:39

They separate the soup from the noodles and beef which was great to ensure that the soup didn't overcook the beef or have the noodles soak up the soup. The soup base was nice and not overpowering compared to other places where you are left thirsty by the middle of the meal with lots of MSG. 

The beef and veggies were in small bags to easily pour out and not to contaminate the other ingredients or containers.  Beef was higher end quality as they used sirloin which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was slightly cooked so I control how rare it would be so it was still tender. The veggies appear to be similar to alfalfa sprouts and not the normal bean sprouts at other restaurants. 

By the end, the meal was filling and I didn't get hungry again until dinner time. The soup was not too hot but maybe since they had prepared the meals with a few orders together.

Located in the Downtown Grand and named in homage to immigrants Archibald Stewart and Peter Ogden, the appropriately named ""Stewart + Ogden"" Café has been the source of decidedly mixed reactions since its 2013 opening but having recently retooled the concept and the menu under the direction of Michel Richard protégé Todd Harrington I finally decided to see the restaurant for myself, an old friend in town coming along for a five plate jaunt through the restaurant's sweet breakfast selections plus a pair of desserts.  Served by Scott as trendy tunes floated overhead amidst a deluge of chandeliers it was to great coffee and friendly service that we were greeted just after the restaurant's 7am opening and seated close to the bar the it was with a simple request that courses were paced out in decadent progression, none less than good and a few truly exemplary over the course of an hour with coffee never less than half-full.  Beginning with a single savory before for moving to sweets, homemade biscuits would prove fluffy yet well-buttered beneath thick spiced gravy and although perhaps an odd pairing with a slice of ""The Best"" carrot cake, I actually preferred the biscuits as the cake itself was excellent while the frosting was just a bit too sweet.  Moving next to a far better use of the carrot cake batter, cast-iron skilled pancakes with light cream cheese drizzle would prove light and every bit on par with those at MTO Café while the similarly topped Red Velvet stack would prove the best I've had to date with light cocoa tones filling the a fluffy batter bronzed by the griddle.  At this point already impressed but expecting great things from what would follow given Harrington's Crème Brulee French toast at Central it was with a trio that the meal wrapped up and with the waffles truly harkening a crunchy yeasted cinnamon roll it was the nearly molten bread-pudding and complex, custard style French toast impressed most - the later begging for a little umbrella given its island influence and crispy coconut topping juxtaposing creamy cookie butter and bursting berries.",2014-03-15 22:56:22

When I entered, I was politely greeted by two young girls, one who was maintaining the wall. I asked if it was okay for my son and I to have a look around and she said it would be fine. 
I had just finished admiring the lead climbing area when we approached my son's favorite route. My son excitedly took two steps onto the wall ( remember he's 7) when I quickly responded for him to get down, explaining that they may not appreciate him being there. 
In the background, I heard the girl I initially spoke with telling a young man ""she's just looking"".  Moments later, the young man approached me in a way that was not only unprofessional but combative at best. He made my son,  who is a great kid feel extremely uncomfortable and made me feel belittled and unwelcome.  I replied that I understood his policy and that we would be leaving shortly. When I proceeded to exit, I noticed the young man talking to another employee, he was smirking and appeared to be boasting about the situation. As I was exiting, I expressed my disappointment with this display and he became more argumentative and rash. The Nevada Climbing Center has lost my loyalty and patronage. I'm terribly disappointed with the ""new ownership"".  I hope for their sake that my encounter was an exception and not their standard service model.",2012-06-03 00:31:43

now, on sundays, it's 2 bucks before 2pm to get in (it use to be free before 11am). and parking goes way up around 11am. we pulled into one of the side street lots and got parking for 5 bucks. as we were walking out, they changed the sign to 10 bucks, and then again to 15 bucks!

it was the same as last year...hot, full of greasy food, and more tattoo'd/booty short wearin/large panus people than you can shake a stick at! which is why it's so damn fun. 

we notice 4peaks was doing a beer exhibition and show, but that never materialized. we did buy the 35 dollar all you can ride wrist bands and made it onto about 5 rides, but then we got tired of standing in lines for over 30 minutes, so we spent the rest of the time wandering around and eating horribly. 

on that note, the deep fried watermelon was actually pretty darn good (it should be a 8.50). the deep fried nutella was gooey goodness as expected. i wasn't impressed with the deep fried reese cup. what blew us a way was the deep fried lasagna. we read that it was super good and they were correct. 

the dough was thin, just on the outside layer of pasta, and it was super crispy and salty. the lasagna itself was very tasty...thick marinara with plenty of spinach and mushrooms and cheese. our favorite food at the fair in many years. 

go early on the weekends and buy a 1 dollar water outside the gate, but don't open it (you are allowed unopened beverages) because once inside, that same water will cost 3 bucks.

Snazzy menu with unique dishes. Check.
Solid ingredients. Most definitely.
Adorable cow-fish mutant logo. Where can I buy t-shirts with this? 
Service that automatically offered to split a check for a table of 9. Double Check

Food. Half Check. I sort of came with high expectations but I will try to keep it objective. Serving sizes were huge. Our table was full before the entrees even arrived. I blame the menu. It makes you want to try everything. 

For appetizers we got calamari, ahi tuna nachos, fried pickles, and truffle fries. Truffle fries were the best--skinny cut and topped with creamy sauce. The topping of the nachos were great as well but I didn't care of the wonton. It didn't quite add to the flavors and fell apart before I could even eat it. Fried pickles, I guess, are a southern staple and unfortunately just not for me. Finally, the calamari was a major disappointment with the 2-1 batter-to-squid ratio. 

My entree was the 'taste explosion' roll which was disappointing. The flavors were interesting but there was too much rice in my roll and as a result turned into a carb-filled car crash when deep fried. For a generalist food fan, it might have been enjoyable, but it was much too heavy for a sushi roll.  I shared a spiked shake -- Sleepless in Brooklyn -- with a neighbor which was basically like your typical vanilla shake with some spiced rum and kahlua. Server recommended it and I'd probably try something more flavorful next time. 

I'm not sold on ""burgushi"" itself yet but I can't deny that this is a good restaurant. It has a lot of charm as well given the odd couple of burger and sushi as well as the strange voices and music playing the bathroom. Don't forget to sign up for the mailing list for a free appetizer coupon! A friend of mine got the Doug's filet roll which had rare filet mignon on top--I probably would have liked that better. P.s.

From the wood fire pit  we shared a pit master, this platter includes pork ribs, beef brisket and jalapeño sausage.The ribs were definitely a table favourite.

We enjoyed our mains and sides with a bottle of Chianti Castellare Classico which was super yummy and best of all only $39!!!

The rice came with a small miso soup and was a decent sized. It had nice toppings like edamame and a Japanese flavoured soft boiled egg. The gyudon itself didn't need the mayo but the crispy tempura bits was a nice touch.

My husband's steak, while flavorful, was over cooked. The challenge is likely managing such a huge production and getting all the orders right.

It's what's for dinner.

No, I wasn't talking about the bachelor party sitting across our table. I'm talking about red meat at BOA steakhouse.

This being Vegas and this being a steakhouse on the strip, expect the prices to be high but not ridiculous like CUT at the Palazzo.

We're glad that we went with the tasting menu, not only did it offer variety, it was priced right at $75 for 5 courses. The portions are quite generous for a ""tasting"" menu.

We started off with watercress salad. I'm personally not into watercress, but hey, I needed veggies. If it weren't for the hearts of palm and the feta cheese, I wouldn't have even touched this.

As a foie gras lover, I was excited when our second course came out.  Seared Hudson Valley foie on a toasted brioche, caramelized onions and blood orange syrup. My tastebuds were all in a frenzy. A fine frenzy.

The steamed Chilean sea bass looked pretty on the plate and tasty in the mouth! It was flaky and moist and if all fish were cooked like this, I'd eat it more often. The baby carrots and bok choy still had a nice crunch to it while the tropical salsa was the perfect complement.

Shortly after, my filet mignon came out. I was a wee bit disappointed that they over-salted my meat but it came out medium-rare as I requested. The mash potatoes wasn't too creamy which I liked, especially after having two of those buttery rolls they kept refilling my bread plate with and those were good sized rolls!

I was in the ladies room when they brought out the last course and the bf was actually finished with his by the time I got my dessert. Our waiter apologized because the kitchen forgot to make one for me! (I know, sad face!) When I dug into my warm banana cake with house made banana ice cream, it was good but the toffee sauce was too sweet, it took away from the subtle flavor of the cake. 

Service was excellent. Good drink recommendations, our bread plate and water glasses were never empty, cutlery were changed with every course and our server even offered to take our picture. (couple of pics actually!)

BOA gives you great value for your money, especially if you decide to do the tasting menu, although a little adjustment is needed on seasoning its meat. 

The bachelor party across our table? no extra seasoning needed ;)",2010-07-14 08:41:27

I think this may have been the WORST sushi I have ever had :(...It's very unfortunate because the staff was fairly friendly (though not professional by any means) and made you feel welcome...but that does not compensate for the poor quality of the food, the dark and unpleasant restaurant setup/atmosphere (it was SUPER dark and the lights in the bartop fridges that house the fish were NOT EVEN ON).  The rice was SUPER overcooked and the fish was definitely not the highest quality nor anywhere NEAR being fresh. And people this comes from someone that eats it ALL. I tried, I really did, but everything that was given to me looked as if it would give me food poisoning due to being old, out of recommended temperature and made with ingredients that were walked back and forth from the kitchen from across the room. The staff had on random clothes versus anything uniform and....it was just a strange experience overall.

Excellent service, great wine pairings.  We can't stop raving about the halibut dish we had, the butter milk vinaigrette totally elevated the dish.

My boyfriend and I shared the half and half (soy garlic and spicy) medium-sized order, which included 10 pieces. Interestingly, our server said that Korean fried chicken takes longer to cook, but it came out within five minutes. 

Another game-changer was the pimento cheese corn paired with the most addictive, indulgent shrimp chips. The shrimp chips were so good that when the owner stopped by our table I asked him how I could get more and if they sold it by the bag. He said that they make the chips in-house. 

All sides are only $4 each, a reasonable price. 

We also ordered a half-order of fire chicken, but it was too spicy for me, and this is coming from someone who loves spicy food. Completing our meal were the bao buns, and we agreed with the server's claim that they were like pillows of bread. If you order protein make sure you put them inside of the bao buns. 

The building and décor are industrial and minimalist, and I loved watching the Korean pop videos on the TVs throughout the space. 

The only reason that I don't give Seoul five stars was because nobody greeted us for almost ten minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even half-full. We had to wave down a server that was walking by before anyone noticed we were there. Also, the bus boy next to us accidently sprayed us with his cleaner. It was an accident so not a big deal to me, but I can imagine some grump throwing a fit if he gets a mouthful of cleaning chemicals. 

This was only its third night open so I am very forgiving, but that service component needs to be fixed if Seoul wants to make a name for itself in Charlotte's competitive food industry.

I strongly recommend either one of those dishes. Yellow curry if you want something small, islamic noodles if you want a big portion. 

We also shared chicken and beef skewers but in my opinion the chicken skewers were better. They make a great appetizer and we were literally fighting over them because they were too good. My only complaint about this place was that the service was really slow and we were waiting a really long time just to get our appetizers.

I bought my first big screen TV here, and a sectional couch (from the westside store). This time, my shopping brought me here looking for a new mattress.

I had visited all the mattress places, looking for a deal. Never ran into one that impressed me enough to make the purchase. Then I dropped in RC Willey's and checked out a few mattresses that I found online. I didn't find one I wanted at a good price either, so I looked in the clearance center and found a memory foam mattress from Health Care for the price I was hoping to spend (under $1K). This wasn't a clearance mattress, it was brand new and qualified for their 100 day comfort guarantee so I purchased it along with delivery ($50). Since I had an account already I was in and out of the cashier area in under 10 minutes.

Special inside note: Right next to the cashier are two massage chairs that are unbelievable good. Both time the demo really took the aches and pains out of my lower back. I will probably sneak in here just for those great chairs!!!!

Fast forward 30 days.....I wasn't a big fan of the Health Care memory foam mattress. It slept hot. Since 30 days had passed I was able to utilize my Comfort Guarantee. Looking online, they had dropped prices on my first bed choices so they fit into my budget. I bought a Beautyrest Marisol Luxury Firm for just $130 more than the Health Care. I hope this will last....mattress reviews for all makes and models aren't all that good. RC Willey does have an excellent guarantee program as well.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. Service was great, no issues there, delivery on time and in the 3 hour window they give you.

However, I was disappointed that every dog was the SAME HOT DOG under different toppings.  Especially if I am paying FIVE, SEVEN, and up to NINE DOLLARS for a dog, I better see some more effort than different toppings.  One day if they hope to expand, they might think about making their own sausages with different meats/flavors (go hot doug!).  

Now the FRIES---SALT OVERLOAD!  Tell the dude over the fryer to take it easy, man!  A good number of them were CRUSTED WITH SALT and I was anticipating a thirst outbreak in 30 minutes.  

All in all, not bad for a place that just opened.  They definitely have potential, but I won't be craving for a return visit.",2012-03-03 23:49:49

Coming from California everything out there is thai food. That's great but when you want really yummy chinese food it's just not the same. This place is my new favorite. You can tell they really care about putting out good food. Even the egg rolls are delicious. I say ""even the egg roll"" but so many restaurants just buy the cheapest frozen egg rolls and don't care. These are really good and shows making their customers happy means something to them. I love that and will be back to try everything on the menu.

The space itself looks nice and even though the place was packed, service was decent, just have to wait a bit. 

Menu is pretty big one for appetizers and meals and one for desserts and drinks. We ordered a few items and here's what's good and what's not:

GOOD
- grilled ox tongue
- popcorn chicken (tasty and huge portion)
- fruit tea (slightly too sweet but very flavourful)
- french fries (it came with some of the items we ordered)

NOT SO GOOD
- cheese filled pork cutlets (tasted like cheeze whiz inside and wasn't like what I was expecting)
- Japanese curry pork cutlet with rice (this curry was very very bad. DONT just don't do it)
- Taiwanese sausage (these were big but too lean and not fatty enough)
- Traditional grass jelly (the grass jelly has ribbed can marks so I'm guessing it came from a can. It was soft though so still decent but I didn't know there was coconut jelly inside. It just said jelly on the menu. The coconut flavour overpowered everything and I don't even like coconut flavour. Totally ruined the entire dish for me)

As you can see it's a 50/50 split. They also have individual hot pot which looked good (I was checking out my neighbour's food after some of my dishes disappointed). Maybe next time when it's super chilly I'll give this place another go. 

Prices were decent. It was out to $85 after taxes.",2016-11-26 02:19:20

The server said the chef gave me an extra slice because the two I ordered looked small. Ok, that's cool, leftovers for later. My eggs were good, but they and they bacon were excessively greasy. The bacon was... meh. Overcooked and has this ""in the fridge too long"" aftertaste. My French toast had the same aftertaste, and wasn't anything special. My whole meal was around maybe Dennys quality. 

My wife's buttermilk pancake was super thin, not fluffy at all. Her bacon was overdone. Her home fries were full of onions and green peppers, which were on top of her pancake, so guess what her pancake tasted like? Ew. We asked for an order without the onions and peppers, but were told they don't have that. They offered us an pancake in their place because she was still hungry, which we took. They didn't charge us extra for the pancake, but they didn't take the cost of the home fries off either.

(Ironically, I didn't even order a burger.)

We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and the place was already bustling. After sitting down at one of the last free tables, I perused the menu and quickly decided to order the Brisket Hash (""shredded beef brisket, potato, onion, and seasonal vegetables. Served with warm cornbread & two sunny side up eggs"").

It's a good dish, although it saddens me to say that it was not served hot. It was barely room temperature when I received it, and this continues to be one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants. (Seriously, how difficult is it to serve a hot meal hot?)

Anyway, the food is otherwise very tasty. The hash is quite flavorful and packed with tasty elements, although the beef brisket itself was a little on the sparse side. (I quite enjoyed the innovation of using french fries in place of potatoes, which gave the whole thing a kind of poutine-like feel.) The cornbread is decent, especially for Toronto.

Arrive 25 minutes early for our reservation and are immediately seated. Place is very modern upscale Italian eatery with various rooms, nooks, crannies, side rooms etc that gives each type of patron from an intimate 2 top to a larger party options.  

Quickly presented with the bottled water option, the wine list etc and two wonderful valued Sicilian wines are offered and IN VINTAGE.  Some garlic bread and rolls are presented with an Olive Oil garlic dipping sauce but the bread is Not hot and garlic bread simply cold.  

Various specials are given and many lean hard on White Truffles which are an additional $80.00 to any entree BE CAREFUL HERE on this part. If you stick to the basic menu you will be very satisfied. 

Appetizers in no particular order:

Shrimp Lemon butter Garlic two large shrimp in a delicate sauce were very fresh and extremely tasty. 

Stuffed pepper ""nonna's"" with beef, veal, mozerella, and eggplant topped with an unassuming marinara sauce was very much top shelf. 

Ceasar salad was very authentic with hearts of unbroken romaine lettuce with large slices of cheese covered with dressing heavy on anchovies and a hard boiled egg for esthetics. 

The Real winner was the Meatballs which were absolutely outstanding. 

Entrees:  No particular order

Veal marsala was two pieces of nice tender scalopini with a delicate sauce roasted potatoes and brocollini.  Thought the amount of veal was a little light for the price point but a 7 out of 10 taste wise. 

Two Special Veal Osso Bucco one with ""Faro"" not quite sure what that is were absolutely fresh and outstanding, quality and taste wise. $45.00

The best thing on the table was the Grilled Veal chop hanging off the bone it was by far one of the best Chops I've ever tasted.  With some nice mushrooms it was clearly one of the finest dishes presented. 

LOSER: My entree  Pasta Carbonara was almost cold as you can see the cream sauce congealing as it sat.  The peas were almost not cooked as the were hard like rocks and the overall taste of the dish was lacking in every facet on a 1-10 this one gets a 1 Really NOT AT ALL what was expected as they rave about home made pastas.

Skipping desert and coffee - it took some time to get the check and the appetizers came quickly while there was a significant delay in delivery of dinner entrees. Place was packed but still a little slow on delivery. 

Also was told our Taxi was waiting outside and we go out and nobody has any idea what we are talking about.

First and foremost, Rainforest is geared towards kids and the young at heart. It's not a romantic place to bring a date unless she's into animals roaring every now and then and kids running around.

This new location next to Planet Hollywood seems smaller than their old location at the MGM but still as cool(according to my daughter). Food wise, it's to be expected, nothing special and expensive. Although, the two people in the group who ordered salads were pretty impressed with their food. I had the clam chowder and it was not bad. There was not much in my tiny bowl, a little salty but at least there were clams in there. The kids enjoyed their food and had a lot of fun.

Our server was awesome too. He was pretty busy but very accommodating. If it was not too cold, it would have been nice to sit in their patio/balcony, overlooking the strip.

Here's a tip for those who are planning to go there....DO NOT park at Planet Hollywood and go through Miracle Mile. It's a looooooong walk. Park at Cosmopolitan and take the bridge or pay $5 at the parking lot across the street and take the bridge.

We went on a Sunday night, and we had difficulty placing an order because they were out of a lot of menu items/beers.

The hot seitan wings were pretty good, I liked that they actually had some kick to them and enough sauce to make them satisfyingly moist. The whole order though was pretty pricey for the small portion size, especially compared to seitan wings offered elsewhere in Pittsburgh (OTB, Spak bros, etc), and the wing sizes were really mis-proportioned which made splitting the order as an appetizer awkward.

They were out of vegan rolls for burgers, but I was craving a one, so I ordered the vegan lentil burger anyway on the multigrain bread. When it arrived, it had no toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) so I had to call back the waitress to ask for them and for some mustard. The lentil patty was good, but the meal tasted like a sandwich rather than a burger. The vegetable side of zucchini and squash was pretty watery and mild, though not terrible, I regretted not ordering a different side.

I'm not sure if it is always like this or if it is only during happy hour but they have several options for appetizers and you can get 1 for 10, 3 for 25 or 5 for 40. We opted for 3 and a few martinis.

The Shrimp Dumplings were OK, of all the things we had they were the least impactful. I would recommend you try something else.
The Chalupas were dericious. We loved these guys. The avocado sauce was great, the meat was great, even the tortillas were good. Definitely should be the top of your list when eating here.

Once acclimated, the menu board takes a little bit of studying and you kinda have to strain your neck looking up at the menu board as your place your order.

Like Subway or Chipotle, you give your order and they start cooking or reheating, depending on the protein.  One customer at a time.

The setup is great for individual meals but can get a bit hectic when placing orders for multiple items. 

Despite the craziness, they managed to get my entire ""to go"" order put together with little fuss.  Felt a bit bad for the people in line, behind me, who had to wait it out a bit.

With the cooked food all packaged and paid for, I head to their excellent little buffet of sauces and peppers.


The verdict?

Probably the best Taco & Burritos I've experienced in the Valley.

In visiting many of the valley ""taco shops"", I'd give 5 Stars for flavor and bite.
- Asada - Burrito
- Asada - 5 Street Tacos
- Grilled Fish Fajita - 3 Flour Tacos
- Baja Shrimp Fajita - 3 Flour Tacos
- Sauce and Pepper Buffet

The only downer was the Shredded Pork.  It was a bit too salty.

Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly enough, albeit razzled from trying to prepare multiple menu items.

Because it takes time to cook some of the meats and the tortilla, best bet would be to avoid ordering too many items.  Patience is key.

Moji Japanese Eatery is a restaurant that had opened recently. Its clean and friendly staff made it extra easy for people to sit and have a relaxing time and with photos of their food popping up online looking marvelous, it sure was a no-brainer for one to come and check out this establishment. We got their on a weekend afternoon and the place was half full.  We had gotten a seat right away which was great as we were all quite famished for the day.  Their menu again looked quite appetizing so after scanning the entire menu, he four of us all decided to order something a little different.

I wasn't feeling too well that afternoon, had lost my voice and was fighting a cold and I was hard pressed to find any good ginger teas in the neighborhood but as luck would have it, Moji's actually had one on their menu.  Normally I don't talk about the teas but this one was exceptionally good.  With steam pouring off the top, this mixed fruit ginger tea was hit all the right spots.  It was not overly sweet and had plenty of ginger extract in it.  The cup was no small cup either so certainly well worth the money one is paying.  

The Avocado Don was a dish that we had ordered for my daughter.  She loves avocadoes and crab meat so this dish was perfect for her.  Presentation wise it looked like a piece of art.  There were plenty of crab meat and the avocado was yellow and green with not a hint of blackness in it indicating that it was freshly cut and served.  There was again plenty of rice underneath all those ingredients and it was so yummy that my daughter actually finished the entire bowl herself.  For those who are not interested in rice noodles and would like a refreshing rice and salad, I think this bowl would certainly do the trick.  

I could best describe this item as this was my main dish for the day and it was absolutely tasty and delicious.  The eel was beautifully done with the perfect texture and seasoning and with fresh seaweed, beans melons, ginger and eggs, this dish was an absolute delight to have.  The eel was not mushy or stale and one could tell it was quite fresh when it was served.  There were plenty of rice along the bottom and the bowl, even though it is difficult to see from the photos, was rather large.  I would highly recommend this dish to anyone who loves Unagi Don as this one in my mind was made to perfection.  

I didn't really get a chance to taste this dish but I did have a taste of the soup base and it tingled on the right senses when I had it.  It was seasoned perfectly and according to my friend, the beef was very thinly sliced and it too tasted as advertised.  

My wife ordered the Seafood Tempura Donburi and pretty much gave it a thumbs on this dish.  The soup base could have been a touch more seasoned as it was slightly bland but otherwise she was happy with her order.  The shrimp tempura was crispy and hot when served and the shrimp was not soggy and mushy indicating that it too was pretty fresh.  There was also some squid inside her bowl of noodle soup, about a half dozen pieces or so.  The squid was tender and with some corn, eggs, beans and mushrooms it was a near perfect dish for her to have.   

Overall, everything tasted amazing.  I was able to take a sample of each of the items that were ordered and I can tell you that everything was fresh and tasty and the soup bases were spot on where it was not too salty or loaded with MSG.  I would definitely come back again although parking could be crazy there on the weekends however if you get a chance to go visit New Kennedy Square at Highway 7 and Kennedy Road be sure to pay a visit to Moji Japanese Eatery.  I am sure you would not be disappointed.",2016-11-25 05:58:09

Nothing says ""middle of spring"" like lunch on College, on a Monday with friends. 

Utopia's a cute little place. I found the staff just attentive enough and consistent with bringing our food out on time.

I REALLY liked my meal. I had a lamb sausage-and-brie burrito (which actually looked more like a wrap). Mmm - SO tasty. Also loved the rice and peas (yum! almost like mom's!), and the generous helping of freshly made coleslaw.

I also had a lava cake for dessert. Or rather, had a third of a lava cake. I actually thought there'd be ooey-gooey chocolate in the middle. But it was firm all the way through, and super-rich. Plus, I had no room after the ""burrito"", so I'm savin' it for later!

The pricing also seemed fair: my lunch entree was $12, and the lava cake was $5.

The only minor quibble: because it's such a small establishment, the tables were close together. As a result, I almost felt like I was being a little loud/obnoxious to the two young women sitting about a foot away from me. I know there's nothing that can be done about that. Maybe I'll have to  come back here when the back patio's open.

It's probably because I went for lunch after 1 p.m., but I honestly have no complaints about this place. I'd definitely return.",2011-05-02 23:32:44

I ordered the Garlic Shoyu Ramen - Isshin roast garlic oil, bamboo shoots, nori, marinated soft boiled egg, pork belly cha shu, green onions and thin wavy noodles.  The broth was flavourful and not too garlicky, so I managed to finish most of it without dying of thirst.  The pork belly was tender and tasty, plus all the ingredients complemented the ramen dish, plus the noodles were thin and cooked al dente.

For the side, I ordered the Takoyaki - deep fried battered octopus formed into balls topped with bonito flakes, takoyaki sauce & kupe mayo.  It was cooked nicely, crispy on the outside and soft inside which bursted with flavours and so delicious that I almost ordered another side because it was that good.

For the drink, I ordered the green tea which to my disappointment was a tea bag in a cup. I was expecting loose tea leaves or perhaps a pot of tea.  I would have prefered they just poured me a cup so I didn't have to see the tea bag.  It wasn't a good impression for me since I prefer loose tea leaves and thought that was what was being served.  Not a big deal, but I just find loose tea leaves taste a lot better and makes for a better presentation.

Service was welcoming and friendly, plus quite attentive as my glass of water and tea was never empty.

If It wasn't for my comp rooms and upgraded red room, I believe i would of past.

The casino floor is a bit small. everything seems so congested. I didn't venture into other parts of the casino or hotel. From the crowd, it seems like more of a couples or family scene. It gets so crowded near the path to the elevators.

The hubs and I were greeted by a very polite and well dressed man who seated us near the window at a tableclothed two top adorned with a pair of wine glasses and neatly folded cloth napkins. A view of the dining room showed a uniformed display of white with a subtle touch of olive green in front of a backdrop of textured walls reaching the high ceiling. Very clean and symmetrical. Will have to bring hubs to dinner to experience the nighttime ambiance.  
Our waiter greeted us promptly and took our order which was probably enough to feed a third person but upon arrival, the table next to us was being served sushi for 2 on an enormous platter--how can we resist? Yes, please! And while we're waiting, we'll have an order of shrimp tempura! And sake for the mom since that was the reason we came here. 
A small, no frills iceberg lettuce salad topped with ginger dressing and a delicious white miso soup arrived at our table which balanced our tempura appetizer.  
Our sushi for 2 arrived quickly followed by a pair of 'ooohhhs & aaaahhhs' as we gazed at the platter with an appreciation that SAKE has a few well trained sushi chefs! Score one for the Southside works! 
Sushi rice was seasoned perfectly--not too cold and whole rice grains stuck together nicely without being glutinous.  Fish slices cut diagonally in the correct thickness and length. Taco (Octopus) was tender enough to bite thru. A delightful feast to the eyes. 
A truly delicious fare for our full tummies as we finished the last few bites.

Service was very friendly and efficient. The atmosphere was comfortable enough and they had wine, so I was happy. I ordered a glass of Gruner Veltliner but was immediately struck with jealousy at the cool steins of Polish beer at a neighbouring table. I am not a beer drinker, but if you are, I highly recommend one of those bad boys.

I had a hard time deciding what to order since I grew up in a kitchen with a Polish grandmother and a Hungarian grandfather. We ate a lot of potato pancakes, perogies and goulash when I was a kid. I decided on the Bigos (Hunter's Stew) and a side of potato and cheddar perogies. My boyfriend had the Goulash and the pork perogies.

Everything was wonderfully tasty. The perogies were properly made and made me a little nostalgic. The pork in the goulash was a little dry, but benefitted from being cut into smaller pieces and eaten with a larger amount of the sauce. 

The potato pancakes being delivered to other tables were massive and looked delicious. The schnitzel seemed appealing, but I'm not really a schnitzel lover so I didn't have diner's regret over not ordering that.

I took a star off for the dry meat. I know a lot of Eastern Europeans cook the crap out of their proteins. Maybe that's why, but a gentle braise will leave the meat nice and juicy. I didn't feel like they achieved this with the goulash and the sauce was a bit flat for me. Perhaps that's because my Grampa loved spice and used to make his very zingy.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while due to the hype, but was a little disappointed. Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out either and if I'm paying $25 - $30 for an entree I expect the food to be pretty spectacular. I came here with a group of friends before a show at Gammage. My husband and I shared the soup special which was a white bean pork soup, the PEI mussels and the osso buco. To drink, my husband had the Franziskaner and I had the Green Thing and a margarita. The soup and mussels came out first. The mussels were good, but I've also cooked mussels as good as these. The soup was lukewarm, we should have sent it back but were with a group and didn't want to be bothersome and it was not as robust or flavorful as expected. They split the osso buco for us which was nice, but it wasn't one of the better osso bucos that I've had. The pork was cooked perfectly, but I felt that the sauce on it was too sweet and a little overpowering. It came with toasted white beans and sugar snap peas which I found to be a strange combo, a potato or other starch would have been better. The dish included gruyere, but the amount was so little that it didn't really add to the dish. My husband chose the flourless brownie for dessert and it was a bit on the dry side. I took one bite and it was good but not great, and not enough for me to want to waste the calories on. My favorite thing that I had was the Green Thing cocktail which had fresh cucumber and gin, it was delicious and very refreshing.

Most places along this strip is small and packed. We came here only because we saw seats available. 

We were greeted immediately upon entering. I have to say I love the decor of this place! Nice furniture and chandeliers.

I didn't try their food so I can't comment much. I looked at their cocktail menu and I ordered the Molly Jane drink. 

Drinks:
Molly Jane (gin, grapefruit juice, lemon juice , lavender)- this drink is nice if you like the taste of lavender. It was a nice blend of lavender and grapefruit. 

Overall, I love the atmosphere and ambience of this place, the decor is beautiful. It is nice place to get a drink. However, prices are on the higher end compared to nearby bars in the same area.",2018-05-10 14:32:20

Good pizza, friendly service, awesome patio, yet it felt a little like dining at a daycare center.  This place has all the makings of the next Old Town hot spot, except it was a few clowns shy of a circus.  There were kids running all over the place while parents ignored them, huge tables of t-ball teams, kids screaming; it was a mess.  Maybe they advertised at some mom groups or elementary schools or something but it was odd.  You wouldn't expect it at most other Old Town spots so why here?

For the record, I don't hate kids.  I just don't want to hear them running around as I try to enjoy a nice meal while the parents forget their responsibilities and treat the servers as babysitters.  

On the plus side, the place is massive, the patio is great, they had some really interesting pizza options and the service was solid.  Maybe the kids just showed up and took over.

My bf and I were excited to try their hibachi since the last experience we had (not going to mention the other hibachi restaurant) was not very good and memorable.

So, we ordered the New York steak and Shrimp hibachi with a couple of rolls. Let's start with the rolls - they were basically the highlight of our dinner. We tried the White Tiger and the Captain's rolls which were both surprisingly delicious. A must try! So after that we thought it will be better since the rolls were so good. Then the weird onion soup came. It had deep fried onions and crispy noodles in a clear broth. It would've been better if there were no crispy noodles. It just tasted funky. The salad that came with the hibachi set wasn't bad. So the hibachi chef started his show and cooked our food. My bf was getting nervous already when he saw how the chef cooked it. He didn't season the steak and shrimp. Put a little salt, soy sauce and pepper in the fried rice and veggies. So when we tasted our food, unsurprisingly it was very bland. I had to shower the whole plate with salt. Our hibachi experience was once again a disappointing one. We were not even given a sauce to dip our shrimp and New York steak. We saw on the other table, the chef gave them automatically the sauce. Plus the chef from the other table seasoned the shrimp and steak well by putting a little lemon and butter. Probably we were just unlucky getting that chef.

The service was not bad. The servers were attentive that's why I am giving 3 stars - one for each roll and service. 

Oh one more thing, I think their hibachi is pretty pricey. So the basic hibachi with veggies is $8.95 and if I want extra shrimp, it's extra $7.95 for probably 6 pieces of small shrimp. 

Maybe we will back for the rolls but for sure not for the hibachi unless we can be guaranteed that it will not be the same chef again.",2013-06-26 05:35:53

Came in after a long night of debauchery and was immediately accommodated even without a reservation.  I, however, highly recommend making one since there were already plenty of people waiting only an hour after opening.

Being situated inside the Wynn, this isn't your typical run of the mill breakfast joint.  The restaurant itself was nicely decorated with elaborate features throughout.  If available, request for the conservatory which boasts great lighting and awesome views of the outdoor pool.  They also have patio seats that's ideal for good weather conditions.  One aspect I particularly didn't like was how the crowd was too hoity-toity which somewhat ruined the ambiance.  Superb customer service though with remarkable attention to details such as offering small chairs for purses which we found quite hilarious.

Instead of ordering something off the menu that I can't easily get elsewhere, the inebriated part of me opted for the Tableau breakfast.  Indeed, that's as basic as anyone can get but it does come with complimentary beverage and pastry basket.

Overall, Tableau is one of the better choices for breakfast around the Strip.  Yet, nothing really stood out of this place that makes me want to rate this place anything higher than three stars.

Being a dog owner, I understand it's not easy to find a whole lot of pet friendly establishment! I get it, I don't have a problem with that! I chose to own a dog, I chose to bring her with us on trips. I have noticed a lot of restaurants are starting to have out side areas for pet owners which is great! Our dog is 4.5 lbs, she stays in her little black bag, So sometimes, I can even sneak her in, without them noticing it! Anyway, The Coffee Cup has seats outside. It was a nice day, so we stayed and sat our self. Turns out, they are just seats! We have to go inside and order, go back and get our food. They will not come out and let you know that your food is ready? So! Unless you are inside, you are not much of a customer! They do offer refills on your soda, even if you are outside! 

The Coffee Cup is located in a very cute area in Boulder City, like an old main street! Lots of shops, and food. I know this was on DDD before, since were on a road trip I always try to check them out with my wife! 

My wife had their BLT on a croissant! Bacon was a crispy thick cut, it was a pretty good sandwich!
I love chili verde ever since I was a kid, so I ordered their chili verde on hash browns, with scrambled eggs. Very good dish, wife even liked it. I grew up with two different versions of verde.

We come here at least twice a month, and the place is always clean and well kept. The employees are always friendly and happy. And, yes if you sign-up for the Harkin's cup deal, the soda refills are $1.00. Not bad. 

I know this must seem odd, but how do you evaluate a movie theater anyway? You can rate the films I guess -- but really it becomes a choice of location, area, convenience and yes, is the place clean and the seats comfortable?  Well, yes to all those questions.  It's a nice place.

Update to Cameron's response!

Hello Cameron, First, we have listened to the one originating call from June.  The two recordings were for the same initial call to establish service.  You did not provide the follow up calls when communications began to break down.
Second, in July we did not receive a text or email for the 30 day follow up on service.  We have to contact your company.  They scheduled a tech who did not show up.  The tech called and stated he was back at the office and missed our location due to your app failing.  The next day a different technician was sent out.  In September we called because we were due for the bi-monthly treatment according to the schedule your company provided.  Since we did not receive text or email 24 to 48 hours ahead of the service date, we contacted you again.  Kayla, the office manager, was rude and argumentative.  There is clearly a lack of customer service provided by this employee.  Excuses were shared as fast as she could come up with them.  Instead of scheduling a technician out, or apologizing for the inconvenience and lack of consideration, we received hostile treatment for requesting the agreed upon bi-monthly service.  The only thing we wanted was a visit from the technician in the time frame your company stated in the first place.  The other request was for you to honor the notification, stated in the call, of 24 to 48 hour notice before the technician is coming out.  Instead of either of these contractual agreements being honored, we received an email with the two recordings of the one call and a blank service contract.  When I responded and requested contact with the owner due to the poor customer service and lack of record keeping, I received an email stated my contract was being canceled for no justifiable cause.  The only cause here is Kayla lacking in training to service your customers.  I am saddened by this treatment from a company that provides a warranty and guarantee to provide service.  We have received a serious lack of service and a level of disrespect by your employee Kayla.  To have my contract canceled without cause is disturbing and worries me about the future of your business when an employee acts this way with your clientele.  As a business development professional working in higher education and servicing national accounts, my team would lose their position inside the company if they ever treated one our clients in this manner.  We would not cancel our clients contract, we would correct the internal problem and provide the guaranteed service that came with a warranty.   To think this entire situation could have been avoided with a simple scheduling of the service technician and a quick apology for any inconvenience over a lack of notification.  Russell Riter",2017-10-04 01:08:43

decided to try it out on last night for telus tuesdays, an month-long event that comps diners an appetizer & dessert if you order an entree. i'm not a fan of these types of deals only because it brings out cheap diners, who tip poorly and have terrible dining etiquette. but we did it anyways (and i feel that we were kind of punished for it, our service wasn't bad, it just wasn't super friendly. i blame telus tuesdays).


Started off my meal with an appetizer of seared scallops on black lentils, prosciutto,  sauerkraut, dill & dressed with a light balsamic and great olive oil ($14). scallops were perfectly seared although a tad cold, lentils were perfectly executed, still held their shape but soft & tender on the inside. a great start to the meal.


For my entree i chose the duck confit with pork belly ($27). the duck & pork belly sat on  a stew of white beans, cheese (sorry, I can't remember what type it was), and breadcrumbs. the duck was fall-off-the-bone succulent. it was literally the best duck confit i have ever had. pork belly was super porky, fatty (in a good way) and delicious. as was the white bean stew, the breadcrumbs were the perfect compliment, added a great crunch and texture.

I loved my main. ed also loved his main, he had a ragu of snails on baked polenta ($26). the other two in our party weren't so lucky. they both ordered the strip steak ($29), the most expensive item on the menu, which comes with nothing on the side. both ordered a side, gnocchi ($8) for one, turnips ($6) for the other. the steak was....not good. i don't know if it was the cut or if it wasn't rested properly (or brought to room temperature prior to cooking) but it was chewy & not appetizing. gnocchi were good, but as with my scallops, there weren't hot enough and were a bit dense. turnips were tasty (because everything tastes good sauteed in butter). our waiter clearly noticed that the steak wasn't received well, both that ordered it left about a third on their plate. when asked how it was, both parties expressed that they weren't happy with it. waiter did nothing to try to rectify the situation, he didn't offer any sort of apology and kind of ignored their comments. it was strange.


Dessert ended on a high note. i had the lemon tart with homemade roasted marshmallow & blueberry ($8), pictured above. it was delicious, the lemon curd was tart & the sweetness of marshmallow complimented it perfectly. an apple gratin ($8) was also very good as well as the soma chocolate & camrel pot du creme ($8).

Overall, a good meal. i really enjoyed everything i had. i wish it was the same for the rest of my party. service was okay. i felt an underlying thread of pretension which i haven't  seen in a long time, and was surprised especially for a restaurant that is as low-key & casual as woodlot. i also found it a little over-priced. maybe our server was having an off-night. maybe he was annoyed that it was telus tuesdays. let's hope that was the case.",2011-08-07 15:06:45

I wouldn't see any problem if the line of people continue standing out the door waiting for a table on a Saturday night.  I had ordered their pan fried dumplings, but somehow they came out steamed. I had to request to take it back.  I normally don't like to refuse food; you never know what you end up.   As for the noodle dishes, the shaved noodles were okay, it wasn't what I expected.  I was thinking of thinker noodle in ball shapes instead of long strips.  It was sort of difficult to eat.  The beef noodle with lemon topped with garlic was delicious according to my Sis-in-Law.  It just doesn't look like an Asian dish.  The noodle with Minced Pork was the best.  However, I wish they had cut the noodles so it would be easier to pull by using the chopstick.  The beef tripe noodle soup wasn't bad either.  One thing is that they actually ran out of wontons.  WHAT?  Wonton and noodle are like bacon and egg.  How can you run out at a noodle house?  As for the service, we had friendly waitress, but very forgetful.  If you want to sit and enjoy a long meal, don't come on a Saturday night.  I felt the wait staff was rushing us out after we paid.  I know there are people waiting, but you can't rush people out like we didn't pay.  I didn't even get to finish my dumplings.  Boo Hoo!

We went in on a Tuesday night and we were the only people there. We were immediately greeted by the server, who was super friendly. I'll say this: the service we had was really good. I would go back alone just for that.

She noticed that I was wearing a Modern Times beer hoodie and commented ""HEY! We have Modern Times here."" Major brownie points - they have a great beer selection and I even noticed a local brewery in the cooler.

The check-in offer is great - it says it's for free fries with purchase of a burger, but the waitress let me use it for tots (more browning points)! My BF and I started out by sharing the onion rings. These are more considered onion strings, but they were damn delicious.

I ordered the patty melt and I feel comfortable saying that this may be one of the best I've ever had. It was really delicious! I also ordered the tots, which you can tell are homemade - watch out for that sriracha ketchup though! I wasn't ready and it caught me off guard. Haha! My BF had the bacon burger and it was HUGE! It was also really good, and he got potato skins on the side. Those were probably my least favorite part of the meal, and they were still quite good.

The cafe by the baked good area makes a killer latte; forget the Starbucks in the Chapters as there's no comparison. My current addiction is the red velvet cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. It's $5 for a slice, but oh-so worth it.

There's also a ready-made food area. When throwing parties, you'll find me in this section buying entrees to serve my dinner guests. Their pinwheel sandiwches are perfect for an afternoon tea party. I also like their macaroni and cheese so if I'm in a pinch for lunch, I'll buy a pack. 

There's a seating area outside of the grocery store so you can buy lunch or a snack and enjoy it right away.

Garlic naan bread in house is better than to go. Unfortunately they wrap it in tinfoil and it sweats and loses any of it crispy outer crunch.

One worker was on the phone trying to fix the phone while another made the smoothies and the third just trolled around unsure what to do. The unsure one brought me my smoothie and some post it notes where he asked for my card to write down the number. I was not super keen on the idea but understood they need my money some way another. He wrote down all my info and then they got the machines working. He began to ring up my order which came out to double them amount, thank goodness I didn't end up blind sided by the charge later. I explained to him how the meals work and he then lowered the price. I asked for the paper with my card back, just to be safe. After all that I got my wrap where he just then realized he put tomatoes on it because he "" forgot to read the note"". Unfortunately for his excuse it was lousy considering he was the one that took the note. I said it was ok and wanted to be on my way because I was real ready to go by then.

While in SouthPark the family and I usually steer toward the typical four restaurants and one day we decided to randomly select and try something different after shopping and Yelp popped up Rooster and we said since it was first in the results we would try.
Today marked our second visit and each time we were HAPPY. Our first visit yielded memorable items in which we repeated one of them = the dessert of desserts Coconut Cream Cake. This cake is not your typical cake it's cool in temperature and extreme in flavor with layers of awesomeness and a MUST HAVE.
Our FAVORITE apps include the avocado toast it's so flavorful with cilantro and pickled red onions and the fried oysters. The oysters are fried to perfection and the sauce is full of flavor. This place is one of the very few places that give you a nice amount of fried oysters in your order which is a plus.

Tonight I tried the grouper over fingerling potatoes and a confee which was tasty, the potatoes and veggies more than anything because the fish was sorta over cooked but still tasty. If it was cooked a little less it would've been perfect. My hubby had the hanger steak which he wasn't too impressed with its flavor. He did however enjoy his duck tenders and the roasted corn side it was amazing.

The cashier let us try a sample of the Royal No. 9 milk tea. This tea has a subtle blueberry flavour as it is steeped with blueberries. Hubby tried the Royal No. 9 half sweet with fresh milk and less ice. He unfortunately preferred it the way it had been sampled, prepared with milk powder and a bit sweeter. The tea became more acidic and less creamy when made with fresh milk.

I debated between the Sweet Dew Oolong (a subtle oolong) and Iron Goddess (a more traditional stronger oolong milk tea, which holds up better to milk powder). I opted for the Iron Goddess since I like my oolong very noticeable. Half sweet was still plenty of sweetness in my opinion. I may try it with even less sugar next time.

I like how they brew tea leaves rather than deriving flavour from artificial powdered flavourings. I also like how they have unique toppings like purple rice, but also make their own tapioca (aka ""Deerioca"").

We started with the pretzel and chorizo fondue which was pretty bad - the cheese sauce had broken and was very grainy. Our server was nowhere to be found, so we waited until our entrees were being delivered, and advised the gentleman bringing our food. He was very nice about it, and immediately offered to either have a new batch made up or to take it off the bill. Since our food was already arriving, we opted for the second option. For our entrees, two of us split the prime rib sliders and the roasted green tomato bacon melt. Both were delicious, as were the fries that came with them! The horseradish aioli on the prime rib sliders was a bit much for my taste, but that's just a taste thing. Even with it, they were great! 

Unfortunately, overall the service was very poor. As I mentioned, we didn't see our server any time between the delivery of our appetizer and the delivery of our entrees. Then, we had to try several times to flag her down for drink refills. After we got her attention and indicated we needed something, we watched her head back to the kitchen, deliver other items, enter an order into the system and check in with another table before stopping by to see what we needed. By then we had all been out of drinks for about 10 minutes. The table behind us also tried flagging her down several times, and finally went up to the counter to make their request. We were planning to order dessert, but when the server later returned to our table, she just asked if we wanted separate checks. So, we took that as our invitation to leave.

Overall, I would definitely come here again, but hope that with time they can work out the food service kinks.

Upon arriving we were greeted right away from a nice gentleman who seemed to be the manger. He confirmed my reservation and actually gave us the choice of having a booth and sitting next to each other or a table where we would be sitting across! So because it was my anniversary of course we choose the booth to sit next to each other. For starters they brought us two glasses of champagne on the house for our celebration! What a nice gesture! We didn't order any appetizers because my partner ordered off the prix fixe menu which already included a nice salad! Very tasty I might add. The special for that night included a Porterhouse Pork Chop (cooked medium well) and for my dish I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye (Cooked Medium) with a Blue Cheese Fondue on the top. WOW again! I will have to say one of the best steaks I've had and not to mention I do believe it was worth the $60! I have to shout out my server for being so involved and helping the celebration of my anniversary go fabulous! In addition to the chocolate cake that came with the prix fixe menu we were brought some of the sorbet's of all different flavors! Each and every one of them was delicious!

As soon as i entered the restaurant, the host greeted me. I told him I was there to pick up my order and he asked if I was ""Cher""?  I told him yes and he took my payment and went to check on my order. A man walked in behind me and another server immediately asked him if he would like to dine at the bar or in the restaurant section of the restaurant. Before the host had time to return, three other employees asked me if I was had been helped. I told them, ""yes"" and before I knew it the young man was back with my order.

I checked my order to ensure the lettuce was crisp and it did not contain any cheese. The last few times my family picked up salads for me, they contained wilted lettuce and tons of cheese even though we requested that they be dairy free. 

This time Boston Pizza filled my order perfectly! However, I did specify that the lettuce must be crisp and there must not be any cheese on my order since they got it wrong the last few times. 

Allover, I was really happy with this takeout experience. The pickup process was a breeze and the employees were really great. 

I'm giving this location three stars as an average rating of my last few experiences. 

Every time I have dined in at the restaurant, there have been no quality issues with my food. I think it happens more often with take-out since you won't notice it until you get home.  Hopefully this is the beginning of improvements at Boston Pizza. 

My favourite gluten and dairy free dishes that can be tweaked to adjusted my dietary restrictions are the steak, salmon and beet salad. I highly recommend any of them if you visit this restaurant.",2017-03-30 07:55:57

Directly across from the National Theatre School and full of food and drink at fairly student-friendly prices, La Petite Marche often hums with the young, focused, inspired energy of a highly competitive arts school.

The plates are bountiful, bright, fresh and filling, perfect to sit and graze on through from breakfast to afternoon. The menu is several pages of fairly standard Quebecois cafe food done with heart and a big spirit. Tasty on several levels.",2012-02-05 18:26:34

Décor is really cool and unique, service is fine.

I've been here only once and I ordered the Kake Udon ($3.99), because I'm thrifty af and also because I thought that trying the most basic udon would show the quality of the soup broth. The soup broth was indeed impressive. It was light and had a subtle, fragrant, and definitely-not-artificial taste to it. I've never really been a huge fan of noodles but I honestly really liked this udon. My friend ordered the Curry Beef Udon ($5.99) and Takoyaki ($4.99). We both tried each other's food. The curry beef udon had a stronger taste than the kake udon, obviously. The curry was rich and there was lots of meat. The takoyaki was steaming hot when it came but when my friend ate it it was already room temperature, so it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, but I'm thinking of trying it again next time and eating it right when it comes.

Overall, Manpuku is a great place to grab some tasty, filling, and cheap food. Portions are surprisingly large with consideration to the prices. I'm looking forward to visiting again this academic year and trying out more items from their menu. And I'll be sure not to miss the +$2.00 combo option this time.",2015-07-30 21:13:24

The food selection here, or I guess at any Tropical Smoothie is sort of guilt-free, tastey, &, conveniently for us, along the way to our hiking spots! 

Because we're here pretty often, I see the same faces working and I know it's early, I KNOW, but we, the customers, are always the ones greeting them good morning. Hm. 

That's not too big of a deal though, what bugs me is that the last two times I ate here my spinach and feta wrap was cold in the middle (first one) and the second time it was still cold at the bottom. We were already headed toward the hike while eating in the car so I couldn't turn around and ask them to make me a new one or finish heating it so it bugged me enough to not want to come here anymore. Not just because MY food was cold, but another friend of mine ordered a spinach and feta wrap as well and HIS was still cold.

But here I am, ready for another hike and this restaurant is conveniently located near us & since it's open so early, we stopped by anyway. Although I'm not giving their spinach and feta wrap another shot, I decided to go for a peanut butter crunch flatbread. I didn't really like this one either, it had peanut butter that was an inch thick, like they took a spoon and slapped it all on there. I didn't finish it and threw it away.

They have an adorable little space and the decor is fantastic. Between the colorful wall with the #healthyaf signs and the underwater painting I don't know what was cuter.

Being that this wasn't my first time having poke I decided to create my own bowl. I was impressed with my bowl but my only complaint would be the options. Compared to Pittsburgh poke it seemed like they had less options to choose from. The unlimited toppings is one of my favorite parts of Pittsburgh Poke so I would have liked to see that here as well. All of the seafood tasted really fresh so again I was pleased with that as well.

We sat down and picked the normal cod, a sausage roll and by recommendation the haddock with maple batter. The waitress was even nice enough to recommend that we only get one of the battered fish with chips and not both as the portion of french fries is very large. 
The sausage roll was crispy and warm and paired with the dijon mustard was great. The fish was on another planet; the batter was flaky, the fish was warm and fell apart without the use of a knife, just how it should be. The tartar sauce was also incredible.

The meals are great if you're looking for healthier options.  This is the first place we've found so far in Vegas that serves bison meat.  

They have great cooks here, because a little seasoning goes a long way.  They do a good job keeping the food clean, not too much oil, not too much of anything that allows the natural ingredients to take on it's flavor.  If you're looking to add more flavor, they have probably 10 different types of hot sauces, sweet sauces that you can add on yourself.

For example, they have an omelette made with 6 egg whites, a little bit of ham, folded over, topped with a few spoonful of cottage cheese and voila, protein packed meal.  They serve this meal with a variety of freshly cut fruits like melon, pineapple to end on a sweet note.  

The average price is around $11 for a meal, but check them out on Groupon for better deals.  Download their app, so you can rack up free meals or smoothies with the online frequent card.  The current promotion with Yelp check-in for 10% off your order.  

We recently discovered the protein pancakes topped with their protein frozen yogurt and it was definitely a fun dessert.  I can't see how this was even good for me, but it wasn't overly sweet and I didn't feel disgusted, so it was just right up my alley.  Totally hits the spot to satisfy that sweet craving.

We like to take out of town guests for a healthy meal because we really like it here.

Let's start with the food -- the broth has a divider that allowed us to try three different broths. We got the heaven, hell, and mushroom (the mushroom was my personal favorite). The heaven and hell pot is called yin yang and you can get that by itself also! The conveyer belt is CONSTANTLY packed with food and restocked so you don't have to wait forever which is a problem I've had in the past. I ordered wine and they do NOT skimp on the wine like other places do and actually know what to recommend. Their serving sizes for the beef and lamb platters were perfect for four people. 

Moving on to the service, impeccable. One of the most considerate staff I've ever come across. They always came to refill all THREE of our broths and drinks. Unlike other restaurants that only check up on you when you wave them down. They explained the entire process for those of us that haven't been there and made the overall experience that much more enjoyable. The manager is also so great! We had a small hiccup with the mix up of food and she (sylvia) came straight out to fix everything and apologize. This is one of the only places that I've experienced this kind of genuine service.

They also both came with fresh, sauteed mushrooms which went perfectly with both dishes.

What is really great in this place is that the dumplings are not all looking or tasting like those usual ones you can eat everywhere (i.e. small, always shaped the same 3 or 4 different types). You will discover unexpected size, shapes, presentation and tastes. Congratulations! That being said, you wil encounter some really weird mixtures in some of these unusual dumplings, which do not allways fit with the basic palate and tastes.

Both right and left sides of the store are fish.  On the left, by the produce and on the right, by the frozen fish both are fish markets.  The closer we got to the left, where the mushrooms were the fishier the smell!  It was honestly horrible!

There is virtually no lineup now since it's been months since they grand opening. However, it still takes around 10 minutes for the order, because they make your food after you placed the order, to make sure it's freshly fried. Your number will be called once it's done. They only have forks at the restaurant, no knives, so if you want to share with a friend, you'd have to rip the chicken in halves. The chicken is so big because it's being held up by meat glue, find the seam, and it's easy to rip open. Be careful of the heat though.

I had the original and crispy chicken on separate visits. The original was flavourful, but I find the batter to be a little powdery. The crispy one was just ok. It was still good, but it didn't have as much character as the original flavour. Also, the crispy chicken that I got on my second visit was smaller than usual, so that's a rip off.

I lived in Vegas for nearly 2 years, was probably there 30 times before I made the move, and have been back twice since I've moved. I know a thing or two about a thing or two and this hotel didn't really do it for me. 

The Good: 
-Room itself was fine, the shower and tub were pretty awesome, view was pretty good.
-Rate they offered me was very reasonable, cheaper than some of the other hotels
-Staff at the Casino bar by the elevators to get to you're room. Same guys were working all weekend long. Awesome group of guys made hanging out there fun, you should commend them.
--Great dinner spots here, not really much for breakfast or lunch, but dinner they are covered on

The Bad:
--There's no place to get food by the pool. I mean they have a menu but it's extremely limited and you have to go inside to find something decent. PS- the casino is like 10 degrees below zero. So when you are partially wet outside by the pool and it's 115 outside, your implants basically freeze and you become a Popsicle this is not the look you are going for...trust me.
--It took us almost 30 mins to check into our room. Now granted it was ready, and it was like 1 pm, we actually walked by the line earlier say around 12 but the line was really long then too. So, we went and had lunch then came back and indeed it was slightly shorter, but not really. 
--Loosing, loosing money is bad we all lost money. #boo

The Ugly: 
--Coffee-I need it, I want it, I got to have it. There are only 2 places to get coffee here, you MUST go downstairs, and both are going to have lines that are at least 15 mins (no joke 20 people deep).  I can barely walk w/out coffee in the morning and I also hate lines. I also was too late to do room service b/c I'm out having fun 
--Couldn't get a late checkout, had a knock at the door at 11 am to make sure we were checking out, I hate this. I was offered a rate of $49 if I wanted to extend the room to 6 pm. My flight was at 420, Just needed the room to like 2 pm. Got a big no go on that one. Had to then go check my bags w/ the bellmen, go to another casino for lunch, come back and then head to the airport. They made this alot more difficult then it really needed to be. And lost me to another casino. 
--Table minimums are freaking STEEP here!  It's 4th of July weekend, I get it, but $100 mins at 7 pm for Black Jack?  The other mins were $200 and $300.  We had to go to another casino to gamble...now does that make sense at all to you?  The tables were not busy at all. Not surprising.

No crowd control because all of the security people were huddled in one area enjoying the night instead of doing their jobs.  And the fireworks went off directly above us, allowing ash to get all over our clothes, hair, and in our eyes (and it was not windy... so I guess they didn't really think the placement of the fireworks).  We didn't get a special glow bracelet that was synchronized to the music and fireworks.  The reason?  They ran out.  They were giving people 2-3 bracelets each when all you needed was one. Oh, except for the one kid I saw with 5 of them. Think people... these will only work again if somehow you know how to program them.

I have been waiting for this center to open for years.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of flow from one section to another. One area, the ""plaza"" section (Trader Joes, Sports Authority, etc)  seems out of harmony as it butts up to the ""mall"" section (Dillard's, Macy's, inner mall stores).

I got a nice lady on the phone, and she asked if it was an emergency and she could have someone out that day. Nope! so, she scheduled me for the next week. An older guy came (you know when they're older, they for SURE know what they're doing, right?) and he was great. Got it done quickly and took my check. He gave me a receipt, and apparently there was supposed to be a $50 service fee that they waived (nice). They didn't, however, waive the $12 or 12.50 fuel charge (which they forgot to mention, but since I had read yelp reviews I was kinda expecting it). 

We have a 3-car garage, and to replace the one double-door, sides and top, and the single-door, sides and top, plus the fuel charge, it was around $250. I needed it done quickly, as the painter was coming to paint the house (DARN those HOA ppl) and I didn't want to have to repaint things after he was done).   Thanks, A1!

The next day I thought I would go to one of my favorite Viet sandwich places and I was reminded of what a GOOD banh-mi is supposed to taste like. Delectable meats, crisp vegetables, mild but spicy jalapeno, and most importantly--soft, gourmet bread with a bite. I soon realized that Lee's is simply OK. The bread is hard, the service sucks, and the sandwich just isn't as flavorful as some of the other places in town.

The next day I tried another banh-mi place in Chinatown and was again reminded of how much better it was than Lee's.

I probably order from here about twice a week for dinner. Are actual Thai people cooking the food? I haven't a clue, but I WILL tell you that the dishes are as authentic as they're gonna be when you find yourself this far down the South. 

I would say their best dishes are the ""curries"" and the noodles. Go for the Chicken Masaman Curry. It will blow... your mind. It's got a savory and creamy coconut base that's incredibly addicting. I would lick the bowl clean if I wasn't surrounded by co-workers. My second favorite item is the Beef Pad See Ew.  Large portion of mouth-watering flat noodles with vegetables and stir-fried beef. 

My one qualm with this place is my experience with the specialty dishes. I tried the $22.95 Basil Duck and was not impressed in the slightest. Granted, they fry the shizzle out of the duck, so of course, one can't expect that robust of a flavor from the marinade, but I was looking for a wow factor, which somehow never came through. AND i lost 23 bucks :(

Since you're probably gonna dish out some dough when you come here, I wouldn't spend time ordering any of the specialty dishes, and instead, take a couple of appetizers (spring rolls? lettuc wraps?) and one good entree. That's definitely going to fill you up and make you smell like Thailand for a couple of days.

We've got tons of them.  But when I heard that Boa was having their 5 year anniversary and were offering 50% off their entire menu, I had to go try it.  Boy am I glad I did.

From the moment my girlfriend and I walked in, we were treated to fantastic service.  A manager passed us and greeted us, and even though it was odd that we didn't get menus when we sat down, they arrived shortly.

We started with the fritto misto, which is a calamari and artichoke dish.  My girlfriend loves artichokes, so she was very disappointed when it arrived and there were only two pieces in all of the calamari.  I asked our waitress Winnie if this was normal, and she said it was.  She explained the dish further to me and told us next time we could request extra artichokes.  Then two minutes later she came back with a bowl of artichokes for us, as she said my girlfriend's face looked like her dog had died when she found out the lack of artichoke was normal.  That was awesome of her.

For our main course, I took the waitress's recommendation of the rib eye, and my girlfriend had the prawns.  Neither of us were disappointed.  Her prawns were big and had a great flavor to them.  My steak was prepared to perfection... probably the best rib eye I've ever eaten.  I didn't even need the sauce I had ordered.

We were stuffed when Winne brought the dessert menu, but we looked it over anyways.  Chocolate filled donut holes with two dipping sauces?  How do we say no to that.  Let's just say we were overstuffed when we left.

Our entire bill pre-discount was $102, so $51.  Oh how I wish it was always $51 for this meal.  Worth it at $102, but probably going to save my pennies and hope they run this promotion at their 6 year anniversal.  Well done, Boa.",2010-01-17 08:46:03

It's not on the menu, but here's a little secret a friend shared: You can create your own half and half lunch combo! I ordered a half salad and bowl of soup which was perfect! 

The Tuscan Tomato Soup was warm, full of flavor and perfect for dipping the complimentary warm bread roll. 

The Golden Beet Salad with Quinoa, pistachios, avocado, goat cheese and other amazing goodness was in a word DELICIOUS! Seriously, if you like beets - you have to try this salad!  You can thank me later ;)

The service here was great. Staff were friendly - even came over to ask how our hike was and about my friend's FitBit fitness band. They even gave us an extra bread roll to enjoy later with our leftovers. 

I'll definitely be back! There's just too much good stuff on the menu - I want to come back and try it all!",2014-02-07 01:35:01

The only issue I have with this place is that the coffee isn't that great.  It's comparable to Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts- but I feel like it should be better.  Every unique coffee shop I've ever been to has the best coffee- this place is just OK.

We were greeted right away and you can see dough being kneaded, tossed and stretched right thru a glass window. Fresh!  Two big screen TV's with sports on. Bathrooms were clean.

Luckily, they had a gameday special.  Which was the 18"" cheese pizza, 20 wings with up to 4 flavors, and a big serving of fries all for $26 bucks.  The wings and fries alone was worth it.  Keep in mind we split it between 3 hungry people and we had leftovers for a 4th person.  As for the pizza, it was BIG with plenty of cheese plus we added pepperoni.  Why the star deduction?

I went with Becky, Boy 2 and Girls 1 & 2. Each of the girls received a free-kid-meal coupon last week during Speedstreet and since we only had half of the litter of childrens, we thought it would be nice to go for a, not-so-usual-for-us, small dinner.
The place is big and spacious and you can see how they're cooking your food. It's very clean and the staff is very friendly and attentive. The place was fairly empty when we visited which made it that much more of a nice, quiet visit for us and the kids. The menu is simple enough and priced like any other deli.
 Some of the items that stood out were the shrimp poboy (one of my favorite dishes) and the white bbq sammich. I ordered the poboy with lobster bisque and Becky the white bbq sammich. Girl 1 had a cheese pizza, Girl 2 a grilled cheese and Boy 2 also a shrimp poboy.
Service was fast and our server was very nice. Except for the cheese pizza, which had too much pizza sauce and not enough cheese for my taste, everything was really good. Nothing blew my mind, but everything was solid. My biggest problems were the shrimp in my poboy which were NOT breaded but, apparently, boiled. Not that it tasted poorly or anything, just not how I like my shrimp poboys and that Girl 2's grilled cheese was very bland.
The white bbq sammich was definitely unique and really good but I am not a big fan of anything other than Eastern Carolina bbq sauce, so not something I plan to order if we go back. The lobster bisque, although delicious, had nothing special or unique about it.

It doesn't lack character, it's the curb appeal that throws you off because it's not much to look at from the outside but inside meaning the food, it's worth exploring and enjoying. Went with a friend on a random Saturday brunch/breakfast outing. S wanted a place close to home, so, I looked via yelp, and noticed Mark's had good reviews and stars.

Anywho, the staff was friendly, endearing, and welcoming. They have a wide selection of omelettes, benedicts, and lunch items. They also have many special items, and from what our server told us, they accommodate special requests since Mark has a knack for coming up with good eats. I got the Ultimate Benedict, which comes with prosciutto, tomato, spinach, and avocado over a croissant, with either regular or spicy hollandaise, I recommend you get the spicy because it's not spicy per se but it has this smoky full flavor that grows with each bite. What I love about this benedict is that it's layered on top of a croissant, so, the bread just soaks up the sauce and all the goodness. I also got a single stack pancake (which is the size of the plate, so, get one if you're getting it as a side), and they have toppings, so, our server's recommendation was to get the banana pecan, my friend got the banana pecan combined with the blueberry compote.

The amazing thing about Eden is that it entirely eliminates that first scenario. 

I'm not suggesting that everything on the menu is going to conform to each and every person's ideal of a healthy meal, but I would venture to guess that most people would find the majority of Eden's offerings to fit well in their individual ranges.

The second great thing about Eden is that once you've gotten over your giddiness at your new freedom of choice, the options available are tasty and creative. 

I've been here for brunch and dinner on multiple occasions and I've yet to find a dish with which I wasn't pleased. I tend to shy away from 'faked' items like cheese and sauces, but someone here must spend a lot of time perfecting these because I'm consistently wowed by either the accuracy or the superiority said ingredients. It could also be that I love cashews [a common ingredient in the faked cheeses]. 

Nevertheless, should you be of sound mind and similar conscience toward living a 'mostly' healthy, plant-based lifestyle, you'll find a tons to love and few complaints about Eden.

We ordered a bunch of different tapas... fisherman's soup, ahi tuna tempura, white ceviche, pan manchego, lobster and heirloom salad, and a pork belly.  Everything was good but nothing extra special that would make me want to come back to eat when I came back to Vegas.

The place is really cute and modern with the little bar area decorated with apothecary jars and cute lamps and light fixtures all over.

At about $3 for a very small cup it is pretty pricey, but no doubt worth it.  I will hopefully be back soon to sample some of their other flavors.

**Meal #1: Excellent foie gras, lobster pot pie, and ice cream for dessert.



**Meal #2: I tried the seasonal tasting menu (pricey at a bit over $100) and the accompanying wine pairings (pricier still at $80 or $85).  Picasso is better, and no more expensive, but I still enjoyed myself.  The meal included hamachi tartare; lobster salad; (third course that I can't remember); kobe beef, foie gras and lobster mashed potatoes; trio of desserts, including an improbable but excellent sasparilla float.  Excellent meal.



**Meal #3: The meal started off with an amuse bouche of sweet pea soup: thin, slightly sweet, with a slight graininess.  A good start.  On the other hand, the roll that accompanied the meal had good flavor, but was doughy inside.

I started with one of the signature trios: foie gras, served both hot and cold, with three different accompaniments (lychee, poached pear, and pineapple).  The roasted foie gras was buttery smooth, but could have been a little crisper on the outside.  Still, it was very good.  The chilled torchon was as soft as warm butter, and full of flavor.  Overall, very good.

My entree was Phyllo-Dusted Dover Sole with Dungeness Cod Brandade.  It takes a simple dish like fried fish and mashed potatoes, and shows just how good it can be.  The fish was barely coated with phyllo, fried until crisp but very juicy and tender.  Under it was a bed of nicely flavored cod brandade.  Accompanying all this was horseradish butter and two tasty sauces.  A winner!

Dessert was three flavors of panna cotta: mango, coconut, and passion fruit.  I was a little disappointed.  The mango version was bland; it barely had the flavor of the fruit.  The same was true for the coconut version, which paled in comparison to a perfect version I had at Okada a few months earlier.  The passion fruit panna cotta was much better, with the sweet and very tart flavor of fresh passion fruit.",2007-06-20 19:00:22

The SO and I managed to score a table after a 20 min or so wait. 

We sampled shrimp dumplings, some shrimp and pork, the eggplant with shrimp paste, assorted veggie dumplings, the steamed egg custard and bean curd, sticky rice, fried pork dumplings, tofu with shrimp, squid tentacles and tea. To be honest I was really disappointed that we did not go to Markham. The dim sum was really ""meh"" - with the veggie options being particularly sub par. The squid tentacles were the standout.  Food came fast, but it was also on the pricier side. I was full, definitely, but not really impressed.

It was about a 5 minute walk to the spa. Came in and walked upstairs to the front desk. They gave me a new client form to fill out. It was a little difficult to complete as they use eraser boards with thick black marker. The markers are so thick that it is too hard to write in the small areas provided. They need to invest in thin eraser markers. Waited just a few minute and the girl came to get me. Her name was Tahlia and she didn't communicate really, and hardly said a word. From the reviews I read they supposedly give a thorough skin analysis which she just said ""oh your skin is soft and you don't need a lot of extractions"" so we ended up choosing the Urban Renewal Facial after she tried to tell me I should add on a $25 collagen mask without explaining why.

(Urban Renewal Facial: A deluxe facial experience for all skin types but especially good for skin that is sensitive, mature, dry and/or dehydrated. This rejuvenating facial includes all the components of the Pure + simple Facial plus a a two step mask procedure, hand, foot + scalp massage. $99)

So I don't know but many reviewers said that coming here was their first time getting a facial etc. etc. I lived in Arizona the ""spa capital"" for four years so I may be a little biased. This facial wasn't amazing. At most is was fair-good. It was more of a soft massage with 2 masks, 3 minutes of extractions (probably the shortest I have ever sat through) and the rest was just rubbing.
I guess you could call this a massage/facial? Because 70% of the time it was just rubbing my face over and over. Then during the 1st mask she massaged my legs and feet and during the second one she massaged my arms/hands/scalp. This was relaxing, better than having them leave the room. Although she did leave the room to change the water one time. 

Another thing that kind of boggled my mind...I was reading in the lobby that they do lash tinting and I was in need to get my lashes tinted. So at the beginning of the facial I asked if there was time to do that at the end. She said ""well that takes around 30 mins...so no"" I was like umm huh? Then she said ""i have a client after you"". There was no offer to see if there was another esthetician that could do the service for me. They obviously don't care for increasing their business. I just figured that I will go somewhere tomorrow that wants to do it for me and get it done.

When the facial was done. She stopped, stood up and just said ""mmm ok"" and left the room. I WAS SO CONFUSED?! I was like ummm is it over? Do I get up and change now? I waited 2 minutes and got up and changed. I then opened the door and walked myself upstairs where she was standing without a smile. She gave me her 2 minute speech on trying to sell stuff that she used during the facial. Then left. 

Usually after a facial when the client opens the door the esthetician is waiting there with water and walks you to the check out asking how everything was. This was just plain weird. I had to remember to walk up the stairs and go left or right since the place is a little confusing. 

Another note, during the whole facial you could here people stomping up and down the stairs. I read this in another Yelpers review and didn't think it would be so bad. They should do two things, increase the music sound (it is low anyways) and have their staff wear soft soled shoes or slippers. 

The lady at the check out was nice, after I paid she asked if I wanted to book my next facial. I said no politely and left.

Overall just an odd spa experience. :S",2013-03-23 01:17:53

But in all seriousness, this mom and pop shop type Vietnamese restaurant was on par with the average Viet place in the GTA, even though it's in Newmarket. So... I wouldn't necessarily say it was Pho-nomenal; but if you compare them with their peers in the area, they're pretty good!

On first impression I wasn't too big on the name, I mean, I don't want to go to a place that sounds like a joke... but I was already in the plaza after going to the bank, and if you're in the area around lunch time, the street that this place is on (Davis Dr.) is a total mess.. which meant getting to another Pho place would be another 15 min drive.... so I figured why not give it a try.

When I entered, this place was actually no joke! This place was so busy! I was really surprised! It seems like the locals really like this place. I like when a place is busy since it likely means that the food is fresh. People were even getting take out! In the short 45mins I was there they served two or three take out customers.

There are plenty of tables. The restaurant probably seats 40+ people easily. My only criticism is that it was kinda dark inside. The place doesn't get much natural light and the place was dimly lit. Also, the decor was questionable, but I wasn't at all concerned about, nor was there for, the ambiance. Oh another thing is that the tea is served in beer mugs... it's fine, but I'm like... but why?! ‍

As busy as it was, there was only one guy serving, bussing, and running the cash. I'm not sure whether they just weren't expecting too many people or if that's just the way it is most of the time. Either way, he did fine, and the food came fast anyway.

The Pho was legit (I got the dac biet), definitely comparable to home made Pho and I did enjoy the clarity and the tastiness of the beef broth. I also appreciated how they ran the bean spouts through hot water before serving. It really minimizes the chances of any bad bean sprouts ruining the rest of your day. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you haven't been to enough Pho places. The herbs were fresh, the lime provided was a bit dry.

Overall, the place is on par, and I will definitely go again. Does seem like they are serious about being Pho-nomenal, and I do hope they continue to find ways to live up to the name.",2017-03-28 01:58:18

First of all, there are both indoor and outdoor options- if you sit outdoors on a nice day (like we did) you are underneath huge umbrellas behind the pool. The inside atmosphere seems nice too, just a little more quiet.

Second of all, the food is really good. We had the duck hash and the french toast. The duck hash was really interesting because I am used to a poached egg with hollandaise and this was a cooked egg with a roasted tomato sauce. There is a generous portion of duck too. Really delicious. The french toast is one of the best I've had-- there are bits of candied orange in there which is a nice touch, but didn't taste too much of the white chocolate. But most importantly, the texture is spot on: crunchy on outside and soft and spongy on the inside.

Don't forget their house bread-- don't get the cornbread (too dry); instead, get the bacon and the poppyseed. Yum.

delicious.  My first interaction with the hostess was not very pleasurable,
I went into the restaurant at 1120a and they didn't open till 1130a. Gasp.
I wanted to sit down, grab a glass of wine and read Creative Loafing and wait for my girlfriend.  Let me just say I was denied access. 

 I know I have a lot of nerve showing up so early and before anyone explains to me the inner workings of a restaurant, I supported myself, full time, non-stop as a waitress for twenty years.  Let's just say good thing the food was delicious or I would have not been back.  Finally when the hostess saw fit to sit the now three tables at the door, she walked me to my table. 

 I sat down and ordered a glass of Prosecco, it came a little flat, I thought,  BOOOOO, but I couldn't complain, it would just be in bad form.  I drank my flat sparkling, I have had worse.  We started with basil rolls and chicken Larb.  The basil rolls were fresh and the dipping sauce was the perfect sweetness with a tiny kick of spicy chile paste.  I have only had Chicken Larb served chilled like a salad, this Larb,  the chicken was freshly cooked and served room temperature. Larb is usually a meat concoction of mint leaves, chili, onion, rice powder
in lime juice and fish sauce.  We also shared some chicken red curry, it was great, how can you go wrong with coconut milk and red curry?   

My second visit I went at a more suitable hour of 1p, so I didn't get any
lip from the hostess.  We had basil rolls again, shrimp fried in egg roll
wrappers and Pad Thai, everything is fresh and the heat index is perfect, you can ask for chili sauce and make dishes as spicy as you like.  I love this restaurant, I think I would go on off hours or weeknights or expect a wait, the restaurant only sits about 75 people. It is priced reasonable at lunch, with a bottle of wine our bill for two was $60, half of that was the wine.  If you haven't eaten Thai food, I would recommend going with two or more people so you can order a lot of food and try a lot of different items.

So far, everything I have had has been off the charts fresh and scrumptious.  I feel like everyone is allowed to have a bad day, maybe I could make sure I am really nice next time I go in there, maybe she won't remember me as that customer that came in too early.  I would rather be known as that lady who drinks at 1132a.

Main was organic salmon - it was a bit overcooked.  I think it was frozen --- tasted like the Loblaws President's Choice organic salmon.  Ambience is nice and airy.

The restaurant is located in Commerce Court (the Deloitte building) on the concourse level. It's hard to spot from the street, so just look for Far Niente - it's underneath.

Once inside, I was pleasantly surprised by the casual,cool vibe. The restaurant has a large bar area, with fairly loud music and plenty of funky light fixtures. Most of the tables are tall and large to accomodate group events. The menu has both small plates (three items for $25 and five items for $40 after 4. p.m.) or large platesfor around $13-$20. They also have martinis for $4.44 after 4 p.m.! 

My sister and I ordered a steamed edemame to share, which was a generous portion with lots of salt and spicy chilis. I had the spelt rigatoni with whole roasted mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese, while my sister had the jail island salmon which comes with fingerling potatoes, bok choy,mango, lime and coriander. We both really liked our mains. The pasta sauce was full of large pieces of tomatoes and big mushrooms, and the pasta was perfectly cooked and cooked el dente. 

The best part of the meal is dessert. If you ask for a dessert menu, they come out with a tray of shot glasses with about 8 different desserts. We tried the tiramissu and a chocolate strawberry mousse. Both were delicious and decadent and cost just $2. 

The restaurant wasn't very busy and our server was very attentive. I think this place is probably much more of a zoo during the lunch hour, but I definitely enjoyed it for post-work dinner. Note: they close on weekends.",2011-02-26 03:38:40

That's exactly what we did before going into Hakkasan.  There was a large group of us and we needed a centralized place to get organized so that we could get into the nightclub easily instead of everyone getting in at one time.  

We arrived early and had a few cocktails before the rest of the group showed up.  Once everyone arrived, we went in to Hakkasan.  Drink prices are a little higher here than the other bars at the MGM....probably because of the location.

The disappointing part of our experience was the service. No one gave us menus for at least 15 minutes, our water was not refilled, and when we asked our server a few questions about the menu, he was unable to answer them. Maybe service would have been better if we had waited for a seat inside

We ended up getting the baba ganoush as an appetizer, and I had the falafel wrap. Both were delicious! My dining partner also tried the Aryan yogurt drink. I was pretty skeptical but it was actually quite refreshing and served in a lovey copper pitcher, though beware it is pretty tart

Of the FroYo joints that have popped up in Toronto as of late, Yogurty's is the only one that comes close to competing with the chain that's nearest n' dearest to my heart, Yogurtland in California. The consistency of the FroYo at Yogurty's is consistently silky smooth and light (but still being substantial). This is in contrast to Toronto's other popular FroYo stops like Menchie's (large ice crystals in the yogurt), and Yogurt Spoon (slightly runny). The selection of flavors is large, and includes Tart (my favorite; it's a little milder than most ""tart"" FroYos), Honey, Chocolate, etc. The Vanilla is rather cloying, though. 

I also like the huge topping bar at Yogurty's, which includes the usual staples: fresh fruit, sprinkles, fruity popping boba, chocolate chips, cereal, etc. However, they also have options I haven't seen anywhere else, like River Rock candy (which I think is a little gross, but hey, it's your sundae), chocolate-covered pretzels and Cookie Dough. You got that right. COOKIE M'FING DOUGH. Nom, nom, nom. They also have a ""cheesecake"" topping that you put on to your FroYo with a scoop, but to me it looks like egg salad, so I pass on it. 

The bins for the dry goods at the topping bar (cereal, candy chips, etc) are rather small -- which is good since they have to be replaced/replenished often, but also bad because they get a little difficult to maneuver around, and as a result the floor around them always seems a bit sticky. 

The price is a little bit higher than similar shops, but it's worth it for the bacchanalian selection of yogurty deliciousness at your fingertips.",2011-08-31 23:14:21

This may have all changed.  Meeting a girlfriend in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, she chose to stay at The Aria so I stayed there too to make things easier. 

Oh, the joys of a modern hotel.  Visible and easily accessible plugs on the nightstand for my phone and Kindle.  A nightstand safe for laptops that is super easy to operate.  A nightstand control panel for damn near everything in my room. Lots of nooks and crannies for storage, suitcases, etc.  Curtains that open and close at the touch of a switch.  No more fumbling with the privacy card as it's just a push of a button.  The complimentary toiletries are NICE (nicer than the ones I brought so I may be squirreling them away for home use).   

I got a fantastic summer rate, they gave me a birthday room upgrade and they hotel delivered a lovely box of macarons to my room.

The room of beautifully decorated and the bed.. oh, the bed... it will swallow you whole.  I don't have plans until this afternoon so I sit cheerfully on my comfy bed, doing a bit of work and enjoying the gorgeous view.  

My room is quiet and the blackout curtains do a wonderful job of letting me sleep when I want to sleep.  

There are a couple areas they could improve:  

Check-in was dreadfully slow.  I probably waited in line for a half hour.  (To be fair, it was exacerbated by a five hour plane delay...I was quite tired of waiting by that point.)

As it hasn't been convenient to go shopping and buy bottled water, I've been drinking water out of the tap and it's akin to Phoenix water.  I'm reluctantly staying hydrated.  

The mini-fridge that is stocked to the gills with room for nothing else is irritating (although standard Vegas).  You can request another fridge be delivered to your room but that seems silly.  Just leave me a shelf.     

The disinfectant they use distinctly reminds me of my great grandmother's nursing home.  It's a little off putting but only because I have that association.

1. F I'm white, I forgot to tell them ""hey, I'm not white on the inside."" 
2. Naan or rice? No, naan and rice, but damnit I hate the bill when I see it charged. 
3. How come in Indian food terms... two entrees is never enough? It's always two meats & a side entree to share. It always turns out perfect, which is why I hold it too a higher level in my dining out than the ol' Canadian (New) of single entrees and fried appetizers. 

The passing of entrees... the sharing of left overs. The eating with hands with shared naan. It takes on its own/better way of dining. 

Damn do I dislike tablecloths and rooms without music, and that's what we have here. I'll never get over how much I don't like it and I'll never get over how anywhere I've traveled with an Indian restaurant comes this. 

And ghee, this food is heavy. The standard three entree situation is not necessary. Leftovers can happen with two, and one entree with naan is honestly enough food.

I agree with Will in that it's very typical -- typical food, typical service, and a typical scene that you'd find in any such establishment.  Think of it as a Panini's (before they started popping up everywhere around the city).

We went on a Friday night, and it wasn't super busy. It was easy to get a table, and there was plenty of room to eat at the bar if we would've been down for it.  I had a southwest chicken salad that was good.  But then again, it's pretty hard to mess something up if it's smothered with my second favorite condiment, sour cream.  Unlike other bar/taverns, the music was at a nice volume, which actually made it possible to carry on a conversation while dining.

Such a simple menu, burgers, fries, shakes and drinks but it is when you get into the customization that you find the magic of In N Out.

First thing first, it has its own entrance from the outside to the restaurant.  That's always been one of my major concerns - what if the mall closes before I leave the restaurant...  I don't want to spend the night at any malls, let alone the Boulevard's.  

They also have an ""outside"" patio that's actually al fresco to the inside of the mall.  So, yes, you can people watch or be watched by the mall-goers.  Either way, it's awkward fun. 

And then there's the food.  It's a modern take on Mexican food that's not offensive.  I personally think most fusion or modern food is unnecessary and culturally offensive.  However, Olivia's straddles the fine line between creativity and preserving each dish's element of essential flavors.  

This is what I remember what we had that was good: steak tartare pizza, calamari and scallops.  Our server asked if we wanted any dessert and we declined.  A couple minutes later, he returned with a mango mousse - compliment of the house.  It was good and refreshing.

You instantly feel cool as fuck upon walking into this bar. A huge part of that is the AWESOME FUCKING MUSIC playing on Friday's and Saturday's, but the other part is the lighting and interesting layout of the place. It's very unique and almost secretive. There's a weird basement downstairs that you can't get into, then upstairs is where the DJ spins incredible electronic music. There's another upstairs section with a separate bar and dining area, nice little spot to chill. You can overlook the restaurant, make sexual eye contact with the DJ, and flick water onto unsuspecting patrons. What! I have never done that. The bathrooms are kinda weird, at first I struggled on where I was supposed to go and how to open the door. It's even more difficult when you're hammered, but usually there's someone else up there wandering around wondering the same thing. Together, you'll probably figure it out. The drinks are very unique and strong. A good variety to choose from. A tad bit pricey, but it goes with the style of the bar. The food is great too. I've had their sandwiches, salads and pizzas. All were just delicious! I get very excited every time the suggestion of going to Hanny's come up during the weekend. I highly recommend this spot. :)

I go to casinos in Vegas when I have to for business.  I avoid them anywhere else, for their (often) well deserved reputation of being cheesy and tasteless.

I came here (to Talking Stick) to attend a good friend's birthday party and was actually more than a little impressed by the overall quality of the property as a whole.  Obviously they are not failing because we walked what seemed to be a mile from a remote corner or the parking lot.

Degree 270 is not bad.  It's on an upper floor and KUDOS, they have a couple of open air balconies so guests can either be romantic or get the heck away from the crowds.  We arrived early and there was plenty of room to mingle and talk.  Unfortunately you have to crowd into the bar because you have to go get your own drinks.  A promotional girl came around a couple times offering samples of a particular brand vodka (although she seemed selective in who she actually offered the samples to).

The Nate Williams Band was playing during the early hours and was very entertaining.  As the night moved on he was replaced by a DJ and very loud music.  Of course by then the guests were drunk, drunker and drunkest and took over the dance floor enmasse.  While I love to have fun, it just got too Scottsdale show-off-ey.  Time to leave!

It's a very cosy (read small) place, so it gets packed quite quickly. By 10 am the line was out of the door. The staff are very friendly  and the decor pays homage to the hosts' Egyptian lineage.

The Cairo Classic with beans, tomatoes, onions, hard boiled eggs, falafel and delicious bread is ridiculously filling but unfortunately quite limited in taste. Because the portion is so big, getting through the dish can seem like a chore towards the end.

The cumin fries while decent could've been more flavorful. I also ordered the Cardamom Tea,  a couple cookies and a vegan sandwich for friends, who all reported that the food was ok. Apparently the cardamom tea somehow tasted bitter.

I enjoyed my time at Maha's primarily because of the ambiance, experience of a slice of Egypt in Toronto and the sunny day.",2015-10-10 13:11:04

I wrote a review for his more casual Parma years ago, and was saddened (as everyone was) when it had closed. While it was a nice respite to be able to see his fresh pasta at farmers markets and to visit his pizza place (now also closed), I missed the sit down dining experience with his warm hospitality.

Enter Chef Marc's Trattoria. I bookmarked it shortly after opening but I'm ashamed to say that my mantra to eat less carbs (for some reason my brain doesn't count dumplings?) kept me from coming here as soon as I wanted to. It wasn't until my best friend was craving Italian that I suggested knowing JUST the place.

In summary, we were in the mood for classics. We shared a caesar salad which was exactly what you'd expect it to be although the dressing was just a touch lighter than most which was welcome. We also had the clams with linguine and the eggplant parmesan. Chef Marc came out to touch tables, as he does, and we got into it about different pasta textures, our favorites, and which hold different sauces better for different purposes etc. He mentioned that they had a house made bucatini that day, and I became VERY excited as thats my absolute favorite. I subbed that in for my pasta side alongside the eggplant parmesan.

The eggplant parm seemed less like it was dredged through breadcrumbs, and more like it was just crisp egg batter, and it was a welcome change. It gave the dish a lightness without sacrificing any of its silky richness. The bucatini was the first thing I finished- mm! The linguine with clams is just EXACTLY right. It hit all the right flavors and I still dream about it. Fresh clams, lemon, garlic, white wine, parsley and homemade pasta all humbly married together in harmony. It was spectacular.

If you're looking for classics, this is tops if you want to avoid the strip and breaking the bank. I have yet to try any of their more creative dishes, but look forward to the opportunity to visit again in the (hopefully) near future! Also, the music was on point with classics like Sinatra setting just the right mood.",2017-03-06 02:32:48
woAEsSDiG5mQov0F73TeeA,VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,2,5,5,1,"Went there today 6-21-15 for lunch. Stood awkwardly at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone could be bothered to take my order. 

I got a three piece chicken tender combo. When I hear ""combo"" I automatically think fries and a drink....not the case here. A combo is just the tenders,  fries, and cole slaw. I thought that was weird...especially since the combo was over $12.  So I got the ""combo"" with a root beer and asked for my fries loaded (topped with sour cream, cheese, and bacon).  The total was almost twenty bucks...more than I want to spend for lunch.  

The place was pretty busy and there were only four open tables but they were all dirty.  I just sat down anyways...cuz' that's how I roll.  A little chicken crumbs never hurt anybody and I don't want to be ""that lady"" and ask to have the table wiped down.  

These tenders were not good, ya'll.  Yes they were fresh, they were hot, they were moist, but there is a weird dry rub on the outside and the inside is really bland.  I could easily make these in my kitchen.  They have many sauces to try to disguise their bland chicken:
1) Habanero hot sauce - Just gross.  No tanginess at all...just sweet and slightly spicy.  Skip it. I much prefer Frank's Red Hot or buffalo sauce. 
2) Barbecue- Standard barbecue sauce...tastes just like the kind you get at the grocery store. 
3) Wasabi honey- This is literally wasabi-flavored honey.  It is watery and disgusting and I don't know who in the world likes this. 
4) Wildflower honey- Once again....this is just plain honey.  Who is dipping their chicken in honey?  This place doesn't even have biscuits so I dunno why they have honey. 
5) Chipotle barbecue- See #2

The coleslaw was awful.  I actually spit it out.  It's just cabbage, carrots, and vinegar.  Yuck.  

The fries were delicious.  The root beer was delicious.  

Cane's is about twenty times better and half the price.  I have no reason to go back here.  If I ever did end up back here I'd try something else...like maybe the wings or a sandwich.  The tenders are not worth it.

*update* When I ate there I asked the cashier if I could substitute the cole slaw for the pickled cucumbers and I was denied but I've read a couple of yelp reviews where yelpers were allowed to do this.  Eff you, too, blue ribbon chicken.  Why wouldn't you let me?",2015-06-22 05:00:51

Meh kinda is the feeling I had after eating here today. I went with a fellow Yelp friend who works down town. It was the lunch buffet so I did not know what I was in store for, but for the price of $8.99 I thought, why not. The place is really big inside. There is enough seating in there for large groups of people and even an area that looks like it could be sectioned off for a party that would be separate from the rest of the restaurant. 

The service was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. They sat us, they were friendly, but they weren't really checking often to see if we needed anything. I could have just went up to get another drink but decided against it and just had one. They did clear the tables rather quickly but checking to see if we needed anything else wasn't something that happened. So meh...

The food was also meh. Nothing out of this world spectacular but nothing that was terrible. The chicken was good and so was the veggie options. I will say that the tikka masala chicken was a little dry, which is hard to do, I think, for something that is marinated in a heavy sauce. But the sauce was also a bit watered down. So meh...

I won't say that I will come here again, but then again I do not head downtown very often. It was not terrible but it wasn't stellar. So meh. Try it out, and maybe dinner is better than the buffet!",2017-08-18 18:26:22

There is a DJ right by the bar and it really adds to the great atmosphere. I have (almost ) tried everything on the menu and can happily recommend: 

Tuna Tartar: Highest grade of tuna
Seafood Platter: Freshest ever! Coming from Miami I am a seafood snob and this platter always surpasses my expectations! 
Dover Sole: The brown butter sauce is A+++
Bone-In Filet: Lean yet flavorful
Truffle Fries: Thick cut so different from other restaurants 
Lobster Mashed Potatoes: Self explanatory as to why these are a must
Sweet Potato Donuts: Made fresh and melt in your mouth :)  

What really makes STK stand out from most restaurants is that the management touches base with the tables. For such a busy restaurant to do this is nothing short of amazing and such attention to detail is what keeps me coming back for more.

Also, for you people that can grill, but are not great at marinating meat..  El Rancho has a variety of pre-marinated meat at great prices.

We ended up ordering two sandwiches. One being the turkey day with a side of potato chips and also the sprang chicken sandwich with a salad as the side. I spent about $20. We did check in on Yelp (of course) and we got ourselves a free cookie. We most definitely had to go with the oatmeal chocolate chip!

Our sandwiches were delicious. The sprang chicken was the best and it came out nice and hot with the cheese being super goooey, yumm!! My turkey day sandwich was also great and yes, it is sweet from the cranpeño jelly that they put in it.

Second, the Guinness is poured correctly and has been fresh on the three occasions I've visited (three sporadic visits over the course of three years). Third, I do have to say that I think the food is a cut above average for an Irish pub. The poutine is GREAT by pub standards and their Irish stew is full of tender chunks of beef. Because of its location and ubiquitous appeal, the place is packed to the gills on every weekend night in the summer -- but it's still a fun ride.

The other thing I like here is their tomato soup especially on a cold day.,2011-11-07 01:43:06

It isn't overrated, overpriced, or overcrowded. And this is what the Coffee House feels like when you come here. It has a different and unique vibe that sets it apart from every other independent coffee shop as well as corporate Starbucks/Coffee Bean in town. 

I am an avid coffee-shop goer. I love searching for coffee shops high and low to do just about anything and everything - from schoolwork, business work, socializing with my peers, to some quality alone time with a good book in my lap. 

The first time I sought out this shop I was excited, for I had no idea what I was in for. Fortunately, my visit was incredibly pleasant and I felt satisfied knowing my love for cute, quaint, little coffee shops was just met.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by the shop owner Don who to me, is quite calm, cool, and collected. You can tell he loves what he does and feels comfortable enough to make it seem like this coffee shop is his own home. On my first visit I didn't know what to order so he helped me with my selection asking what it is that I am into. I liked that rather than suggesting the obvious and most popular drinks he adjusted to what it is that appeals to me. 

The prices here also are very affordable. You can get a large flavored macchiatto for less than $5! Beats Starbucks prices any day. 

The coffee shop itself is a decent size with many tables, cozy reading chairs, and a bar with stools that faces the outside windows. There is even outdoor seating available which is great when we have beautiful weather. 

Another thing I admire is the artwork sprawled around the room and all the local events he promotes through little ads and fliers. Locals supporting locals are the absolute best!

When visiting this shop it really gives you a feeling that you aren't even in Henderson, let alone Las Vegas. It is that unique. 

I highly recommend people to check out this great coffee shop for its ambiance - relaxed environment and of course, for its great coffee!",2013-05-31 03:57:06

So when we got in we noticed tsukemen wasn't anywhere on the menu. The waitress told us that when they received the noodles for the tsukemen it was the wrong kind and will be another month of so till they the new noodles. Not sure what rake so long to get different noodles. 

So we decided to just try the regular ramen and it was full of disappointment. May have been the worst ramen I had. 

We ordered the smoked chasu to share and I got the Tonkatsu shoyu ramen with garlic chip and egg add-ons. 

Smoked chasu was very flavorful and delicious. Meat quality was decent and the spicy sauce and the garlic on the side was a nice addition. Now on to the ramen. 

The broth - very light, kind of bland, and had a weird aftertaste. 

Noodles -  wasn't bad, wasn't great. I prefer the thinner noodles for Tonkatsu shoyu normally but decided to try it with thick since that is what they normally serve with this ramen

Chasu - the chasu in the ramen is of worse quality than the smoked chasu. It is probably some of the worst chasu I have had in ramen. Just looking at it you can tell the meat is of subpar quality. 

Garlic chips - I liked the crunchiness of the chips, but seemed a little overcooked to me. 

Service was good though and the workers were very friendly and that's the reason for the 2 stars.",2013-12-10 00:09:29

FULL STORY: Had a good Americano here -- not too acidic, not too watered-down, very pleasant with just a little cream.   I preferred this $2 coffee to the kinds they have at Pour (even though I think Pour is fancier, and it's definitely more expensive). 

Atmosphere here is.... oook.  Maybe 15 small tables with cushion-y chairs, and I liked that it was relatively quiet inside.  Actually I don't think any music was on the day I came.  It's just too dark inside... would prefer somewhere brighter if I'm working.  They have some funky paintings and artwork up - more of a college town coffeehouse vibe -- a little outdated. 

Baristas were easygoing and friendly.  Good option downtown if you're just stopping for coffee to go. 

Note: Noticed a very strange character lingering around the day I was here -- talking super loud, kind of making a scene, stopping by and interrupting people working... pretty weird and disruptive.  Not sure how common that is.",2017-09-22 19:10:19

It wasn't until this morning that I had the opportunity to return, and though the place was busy, we were easily able to get a seat (next to a table with a fussy toddler, naturally).

I wasn't in the mood for something breakfasty, so I decided to go with the intriguing Dizi Sangi (""a stew of lamb shank, lamb rib, chickpeas, white beans, potato, onion, tomato and spices cooked for over 4 hours""). The dish also comes with a lamb-broth soup, a small bowl of yogurt, a small bowl of a spicy relish, and a couple pieces of fresh bread.

It's a lot of food, certainly. The presentation is also quite interesting. The stew comes in a stone pot and you're meant to mash it (with the included masher) until it becomes a paste and you can eat it with your bread.

I mashed it a little but mostly I ate it with a spoon. It's quite tasty and the dish is absolutely packed with soft, tender pieces of lamb. And while the flavors are extremely subtle, the unusual dish is quite enjoyable (and extremely filling).",2018-05-11 20:58:32

So in the interests of full-disclosure, I have never ordered anything outside of the late-night $1.95 - $5.95 menu. Maybe the food quality and service is different if you order of the complete menu, maybe its not, I wouldn't know. Suffice to say, about 90% of the people who are here after midnight are here for the steak and eggs and other specials and the servers know it.

This place is all about turn over. When the average diner is spending less than bucks on their meal, the servers try as hard as they can to get you seated, fed, and out the door. With that being said, if you are looking for actual service that you find at most hotel cafes, look somewhere else. Your server will automatically bring you waters for everyone, and your check before you are even done eating. Once the food has arrived at the table, you are highly unlikely to see your waiter again. To be honest, this doesn't surprise or irk me in the slightest. Every time I come here, I know exactly what to expect. Ok food, cheap prices, and no service. But you do get what you pay for.

The food itself is not spectacular, but its good for the price. Its a perfect place for cheap late night eats. Many of the diners are usually drunk from the dollar drinks at the bowling alley or just got back from a club. Definitely check it out if your in the area and want some cheap late night food.",2013-01-07 02:48:37

One suggestion to the ladies, wear some comfy shoes cuz your toes will be fucking killing you if you don't... guess thats the price of trying to be cute.

The only thing that sucked last night were some of the retarded ass people in attendance.  Pushing and shoving is for 8 year olds with bad attitudes, not adults!

We came for Social Sunday for locals which gives 50% off food and beverages to certain restaurants at the SLS. This week it was Katsuya. FYI - the Omakase Geta, A4 robata and the Toro is not included in this promotion.

Spicy Tuna Crispy rolls: 4 pieces for $16 is a bit pricey for this dish. The maguro used was okay but the rice was too soft, over seasoned. The crispy rice wasn't quite crispy enough. Pass.

Lobster Chawan mushi with truffles: texturally it was nice and silky. Flavorwise, the truffle wasn't really there. (Actually all their truffle dishes didn't taste at all like truffles-I think they used Chinese truffles which look similar but have no flavor) The sauce on top was rather overly salty although the dish did improve after scooping up from the very bottom of the cup. Kinda of a meh dish for me.

Vegetable tempura consisted of about 10 small pieces of mushrooms, asparagus, sweet potato and zucchini. Nothing special except the exorbitant price.

Brussel sprouts, fried with dashi and vinegar were delicious. The crispy texture matched well with the nuts and mildly sweet glaze.  and definitely the best dish of the night.

Kakuni (""stewed pork belly""): sent it back because it was an entirely large piece of pork fat without little to no meat on it. Would not recommend.

Wagyu beef with Foie Gras: served with an overly sweet sauce, the dish lacked balance and could have used a bit more salt. The beef was perfectly cooked though and the foie had a nice sear to it. It was okay but not worth full price.

Tuna Tataki roll: too much sauce, mushier sushi rice caused the roll to break apart easily. The amount of tuna was generous enough though. Meh, don't need to order this again.

Omakase sashimi: the quality of the fish was very good however the serving size was rather small given the price.

Came here for Summerlicious, as I was told this place does it well and have done it for several years. It can't be that bad, right? Upon entering, I noticed a Conditional Pass sign on the front door. Hmm...

I was seated promptly as I reserved a table of two. The place was busy! They were right saying if you don't reserve, you're certainly not guaranteed a seat. I arrived about 10 minutes before my friend, but my server allowed me to get started on drinks.

I ordered the insalata caprese, orrecchiette, and the vanilla panna cotta. With it came bread; similar to Il Fornaro in that aspect.

The bread was very hard and tough to eat. However, I liked the olive oil and stuff that came along with it (still can never figure out if it's green before brown or the other way around...).

The insalata caprese was interesting. It was relatively simple, with tomatoes and two chunks of mozzarella cheese. The tomatoes were definitely picked fresh, the mozzarella cheese had the right amount of taste, and the extra virgin oil added perfectly to the appetizer.

In terms of the orrecchiette, it was average at best. The pasta didn't seem to be fully cooked, as it kept sticking to one another. The cauliflower and spinach were a good addition, and the prosciutto was good as well. I asked for parmesan cheese, however my server put way too much on it...covered the whole plate (and the plate was big!).

The vanilla panna cotta was meh...the custard was good, but the berry sauce tasted way off for my liking.

One thing this place has over other Italian restaurants is the portion size. They're huge! My friend barely finished his insalata tonno e arugula and didn't finish his strawberry shortcake.

First, I will say that this place is very clean. I imagine it's fairly easy to maintain since the customers are so few and far between. 2 of the 3 visits were during lunch, and one for dinner. I was the only customer for both lunch visits and one of three for dinner.

The service is polite but incredibly slow. I was literally the ONLY customer in the place for two of my visits, and it still took 10 - 15 minutes for them to make a single sushi roll. I ended up leaving not because I was satisfied, but because I was so tired of sitting there after 90 minutes and only 4 orders delivered.

The worst part was the food. The rice was cold and horribly soggy. It was sincerely disgusting. The nigiri was a huge ball of nasty, soggy rice with a tiny dry piece of fish. The rolls were about average size, but the quality of the ingredients was terrible and almost inedible. Just the thought of that rice makes me cringe.

I have eaten at most of the sushi places in Las Vegas, and Zen is by far the worst.",2015-04-03 21:42:57

I've driven by it many times and noticed that it's always full.  Upon arrival, I was promptly seated and I ordered orange juice and a veggie omelet.  The waitress asked me if syrup was okay for my pancakes.  I looked at her funny and she said, 'Pancakes come with your omelet.'  I was a little surprised by that.

A minute later, she delivered the orange juice, which I tasted.  It had a lot of pulp in it and I actually don't like that.  It was almost too thick to drink with a straw.

A few minutes later, my veggie omelet arrived.  It was huge!  It was very tasty, loaded with veggies, and was very satisfying.  I actually didn't finish it all.  

The pancakes that were served on the side came in a trio, were small, light, and fluffy.  They tasted perfect!  I loved the cakes.

The only downside to the breakfast was the price.  For my veggie omelet and orange juice, I paid over $14.  I believe this was the most expensive breakfast I've ever eaten.",2016-02-14 12:02:08

Misguided in the way that Papa John's, Pizza Hut or Domino's is ""pizza"" Upper Crust is better than those chains but so is frozen supermarket za.

It is worth driving out of my way, picking up some home made smoked mozzarella and other delicacies at Rocco's than having a greasy, soggy toward the center slice at Upper Crust. Or, going for Weds Chef Marc's fabulosity! 

Perhaps for those that AOk suffices: this will too. For those of us who value our heritage, a rare carb fest and miss NY pizza, Upper Crust does not live up to its name or its competitors.

I was wondering if they did a lunch buffet, but their doors were closed when we arrived at 3pm. They opened their doors at 4:30pm. 

Dinner buffet costs about $22.68+tax+tip... Pretty pricey for a dinner buffet, but of course, it's near a bunch of hotels and Pearson Airport. As such I expected excellent service here. The front end reception however was standoffish and slightly rude.. I asked them if they were still doing the free birthday meal, and they didn't really answer me and just started looking into the podium intensely ignoring my question. Upon leaving, I did say goodbye to the front reception, but no goodbye to us, or even acknowledgement we just spent our dinner here. They were sooo absorbed in their conversation. I suppose they were discussing some serious business.... Right, as if. However, our table server was nice, and provided us with fast service. 

The food was pretty good. They have a pretty big salad bar...except that is the last place I would go to when I feast at a buffet.Their hot item selection wasn't spectacular... But they were still delicious. I especially like their roasted chicken and roast beef (carving station); both are very tasty and juicy. Everything else was pretty much carbs (rice, noodles, pizza, fries etc). One thing that disturbed me was that I saw a nacho station...There is no need for something like that at a buffet! Cheap of them to do that actually. I expected better. As well I found most food on the warmers were not piping hot as I have experienced at other buffet restaurants. 

Well good thing is the dessert station is nice. There are two chocolate fountains (white and dark) for you to dip your fruit (cantaloupe, banana, honey dew.... but no strawberry WTF). I kind of expected strawberries for the price I paid. C'mon!

All I can say is that selection is narrow and few for the price paid. The ice cream was soft and from a fresh tub - but there were only 4 flavours (vanilla, chocolate, mango strawberry yogurt, no sugar added butterscotch). There are only 3 soups at the soup station... and none of which are really that great, except the chili I guess. And I feel they could add some better entree items in the hot foods section... there was what only 2 seafood dishes (mussels and some white fish on basmati rice)?

It was overall tasty, but kind of expensive for the limited selection.",2013-02-03 02:28:33

My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday, and he found a Groupon. $25 for $50 worth of food. An excellent deal. We'd both never been here, and he thought it would be nice to surprise me, and oh yes it was! 

The place has excellent decor, very minimalistic and simplistic, however it gives off a very nice and modern vibe. We had a reservation, so we were sat immediately. Probably the whole downside to the entire meal was that it was a tad bit cold in the seating area. But hey, if that's the biggest downside, then count me in anytime!

We had the nicest and most attentive waiter. It had been such a long time since we have gotten decent service at a restaurant. We were greatly pleased that the waiter would fold our napkins as we set them down and pour our drinks for us. He was extremely polite and seemed to have a vast knowledge of the menu. I also liked how he didn't mind at all that we were using a Groupon. There have been countless times where I have had waiters and waitresses dish out attitude for using Groupons or Yelp check-in offers. 

Being that it was my birthday dinner and that we had a Groupon, we decided to go all out. We got the Butterfish and Rock Tempura Shrimp as appetizers. The butterfish came out first. Small portion but PACKED with flavor. Extremely tender and melt-in-your-mouth fish quality. I really don't even know how to describe the taste. It was such a delicate and nice mix of a ton of flavors, that it's truly hard to explain. It was savory, but had sweetness to it, and at the same time it had like a citrusy tang. A strong 10/10. The rock tempura shrimp was literally the best shrimp dish I have ever eaten in my entire life. Tempura is easily messed up at a ton of sushi joints. This tempura was amazing. It was far from greasy, was perfectly flaky, and had a very delicate taste. It came with a chili mayonnaise that was out-of-this-world to die for! The serving size was also very large, which was nice. 

Then our rolls came. We orderd the hamachi serrano chili roll, the dynamite scallop roll, spicy tuna roll, and crispy prawn roll. Seriously. The best freaking sushi I've ever eaten. My favorite was the hamachi serrano chili roll. They were all very delicately balanced in flavor, and came as pretty hefty portions. It's about 8/9 pieces per roll, and each one was so delicious! 

By then, our tab was almost around $90 before the Groupon, so we decided to opt out. I have never been so pleased with a sushi meal in my life. The waiter came, gladfully took our Groupon, and seemed happy to serve us. 

Overall, this is one of the only restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area that gets a perfect 10/10 on all dining aspects. Seriously. Ambiance, food quality, service, everything is a perfect 10. I will definitely be back! Probably with more Groupons!",2013-07-16 16:31:28

The food and plating are exceptional.
Started out with a 2008 Rioja Riserva. Drand great and reasonably priced.
For appetizers:
The spicy tuna tartare and fried oyster combo was incredible. Right up there with top 10 appetizers of all time.
The arugula salad was stellar.
Next course: Pasta
We had the famed gnocchi. Pillows made to perfection in a veal ragu. Incredible. This dish would hold up against the finest Italian restaurants in the world.
Next: Fish
We had the trout over risotto. So delicious and light I ate it with the skin.
Dessert:
Coconut bundt cake with house made banana ice cream. So tasty, and so stuffed.
Shared all this with my daughter. A bit too much food with dessert, but had to go for it.

It's my favorite place to go for brunch. It's pricey and it's not a huge Vegas style buffet but all items are high quality and delicious. Plus, you can order a la carte plus the buffet and the price is the same or just a bit higher than the buffet alone. I also enjoy the decor and ambiance. 

We went for dinner last night and oh my!!! It was outstanding! I knew what I was going to order ( I have an obsession with looking at menus online before hand) but they surprised me with a Farm to Table menu from Chef Lee. The ""theme"" was pork,yum! And to make it even better, 3 courses for $40.
 
First course was pork belly with frisee greens and a poached egg. It was so goood!! A sprinkle of salt and pepper, crusty bread to scoop the egg and it was like breakfast :D

Second course, braised pork filled ravioli with bacon, squash, pearl onions. It also had a bit of cheese (Brie?) on top. I loved every single bite of it! It was amazing, the sweetness of the squash, the salty bacon, creamy Brie and the perfectly cooked ravioli bursting with the  braised pork was just heaven! 

Third course, goat cheese cheesecake with apple compote and caramel sauce. I'm not a huge fan of apple desserts but the compote was on the side.  I never had goat cheese cheesecake before (surprising since goat cheese is one of my favorite foods:) and this was great, creamy, not as tart. A perfect ending!

I've tried various Jersey Mike's along the west coast and they are all uniformly good, Ray Kroc would be proud.  What makes Mike's unique is the grilling of your meat for you Sub.  They have both a Philly and Hawaiian options, etc. 

The quality of the meats and sub bread seem above average as the prices reflect, but still a good sub!

QC9DWjvcogSnVFcmx9Am9g,6djyuTKCGCJHMk79AeiFYg,QrbS4LF0Iu5vApGAJLNzCA,3,0,0,0,"My boyfriend and I went for Restaurant week. While I had planned to order something different than him, they changed the menu from what was posted online, so I couldn't order what I had planned. I was a little disappointed about that but ordering the same thing meant we could both get a good idea about the dish and discuss.

We had the campfire mac and cheese to start. It was thick and creamy. I liked that they used cavatappi instead of shells or elbow macaroni. It's just such a fun noodle and really held on to the thick sauce. The bacon was a little crispier than I expected, but it was good. The onions also provided a nice crunch and broke up some of the rich cheese sauce.

The chicken and biscuit entree was really good. I liked the thick gravy and the evenly diced root vegetables. The beets and carrots went really well together. We noticed big differences in the size of our biscuits, and both thought they were a little dry. I reheated half of my food for lunch later and thought that warming up the biscuit actually made it seem better and less dry. The chicken was really moist. It was well seasoned, and we both liked that it was deboned. I expected to cut into it and have to pick meat off the bone but there was only the little wing drumstick at the end, so that made things easier. 

Dessert was where we differed. My boyfriend ordered the cookie and ice cream, which was really good. The huge cookie looked a little silly with such a tiny scoop of ice cream, but it tasted good. I ordered the lemon thyme creme brulee, which I loved. The lemon and thyme went really good together and mixed things up a bit from a typical super sweet creme brulee. 

I think that the food was good, but with their normal prices, seems a little over priced. Drinks were really the shining point of dinner. We each had one of their happy hour little mules, which defintiely have a spicier ginger flavor than most mules, and I love that. He had the blackberry gin fizz and I had the Prairie fire, which we didn't get to see made but I saw made previously and they actually light the rosemary sprig on fire when making the drink.

Service was good and our waitress was really friendly. The space is really nice, though my boyfriend found their chairs a little uncomfortable. I love the look o the bar and the whiskey posters they have. I'd probably go back for drinks and because I really want to try the beer cheese bread bowl, but I'm not sure I'd be back for a full meal.",2016-01-18 19:08:13

Figuring it would be a more relaxing atmosphere than Jack Astors and have better food than the Loose Moose, we ventured into the cavernous underground restaurant. 

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Our service was great, the food was fresh and the $12 Ontario Pinot Gregio  verrry good (Crush). 

For an appetizer we had the lamb meat balls in a mint sauce (very tasty) and bread with honey butter (delicious). The garden salad was fresh but the dressing overly vinegar-y. I had the cedar plank salmon which came with sour cream mashed potatoes. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were real. My man had the goat cheese stuffed chicken with a ""loaded"" baked potato ( grotesquely huge!). For dessert we had the tart cherries and whipped cream (very good. Real whipped cream and seriously tart cherries, which I love). 

Nothing overly innovative here but good simple comfort food. Dinner for two and our bill came to over $100 (including 2 glasses of wine, 2 pints and tax). These chain restaurants ain't cheap! Overall, if it weren't for our generous gift card we most likely wouldn't have dined here. Given the choice, to spend $100 on dinner again it would be somewhere more interesting than Canyon Creek (The Keg! I kid) But we were ultimately happy with our Circorp roulette results.

Ordered soft shelled crab sandwich with Cajun fries on the side. A simple sandwich, with soft bread, mango salsa and basic condiment mayo adds flavour and texture. It doesn't really compete with the soft shelled crab, but I was hoping the batter on the crab would be more seasoned and crispier. 

The Cajun skinny fries were good! A tad heavy handed on the salt but still nice and crunchy. Cruelly kind of addictive too... I wanted more... 

There's just enough contrast with the caesar salad and mango salsa with the sandwich to balance the flavours out. Since the dish was fried and I knew it was going to be a bit greasy, I requested for a cup of hot water and lemon on the side. That was nice way to end the meal. Super refreshing!

I paid premium for the ""VIP"" ticket package, which included 2 free drinks, your ticket, front row at the show and a commemorative pass. The doors first said that they opened at 6 in the web, then updated to 7.  Here is the reality...
Paid $5 to park in the nearly empty parking lot. Waited in line until 7:30. The VIP area was a raised area on the side, nowhere near the stage. After complaints, a metal barrier was erected to make a small standing area in front of the stage. The 2 free drinks ended up being ""venue's choice"", which were crappy premixed shots. You couldn't even get a beer, soda or water with your drink ticket. When you don't drink and you're at an outdoor Arizona venue in September, this sucks the big one. The ""commemorative pass""?

We substituted the mayo with avocado, then asked for it to be cooked medium.  It was perfectly cooked with a nice pink middle.  MmMmMm

While there was a lot of hype for this place , I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. I sat on the fence for writing a review, as they are still in their ""soft opening"" phase, so things will be hit and miss.

When I went, we ordered the signature clam ramen, smoked ramen, karaage and tofu nuggets.

We were never asked if we would like to drink anything, and we had to chase someone down to get water at the end of our meal. Yup, no one came by to get us water. We were not dying of thirst, but only got thirsty after eating. Would have been nice to have water already on hand.

Honestly the sides were very underwhelming. The tofu nuggets are nothing special, except for being a bit pricer then other places. The karaage had a tad too much burnt bits, and it was more ""batter with chicken"" then ""chicken with batter"". I honestly can't recommend the sides at all.

The clam broth was very aromatic, and tasty. The meat that comes with it is made ""sous vide"" style (that's the fancy way where they cook the meat in boiling water in a bag). It was definitely different from the usual charred bbq version most places serve.

I'm sitting on the fence with whether I liked the smoke ramen. When you first taste it, it's a very nice taste. But towards the end of the meal, you start to realize it's pretty much liquid smoke flavoring that was added in to give it that smoky flavor. What I'm trying to say is that the smoke flavor tasted very artificial. 

Though the actual ramen noodles were probably the best I have had in Toronto. Thin, yet they were still very nice and firm, with a nice bounce to the bite (al dante). 

Again since it's only a soft opening, I expect that there will be a lot of bugs, and I would be happy to update this review once I have the chance to come back a few times.

But for what I experienced, there is definitely room for improvement to go from good to great, but I was not wowed.",2017-12-18 00:34:43

Holsteins is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. There is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. 

Typically when I have friends in town, we seem to end up at Holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel). Either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).

There is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but I definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. Between my friends and I we tried the Drunken Monkey, Oreo, and Cereal Bowl (tastes just like Captain Crunch). For burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - The Classic, The Longhorn (with beef brisket as well), The Rising Sun (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), The Fun-Ghi (with assorted mushrooms), the El Machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the Billionaire Burger (kobe beef patty with foie gras). The Billionaire burger is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from California that can't get their foie gras anymore. You can also add a fried egg to your burger (which I recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.

The burgers also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. I have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for the substitution of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). I guess next time I'll just indulge in the fries.

Overall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. I'd definitely recommend enjoying the Billionaire Burger at least once.",2013-01-30 06:42:38

Udipi's best items are the dosas, which is different from the normal north Indian fare you get in most Indian restaurants. But it will become a craving once you've had it. Rava dosas, masala dosas and all their variants - all expertly prepared. I think I just made myself hungry writing this review!",2011-02-17 19:55:52

Un vrai délice!
Encore mieux au printemps, alors que je les ai dégustées sur place. Tu choisis celles que tu veux, et il y a vraiment beaucoup de choix, si tu sais pas quoi prendre tu decris si tu aimes les huîtres fermes, plutôt salées ou pas, grosses ou petites... et tu mentionnes combien tu en veux.
Ils te les ouvrent sur place et te les serve sur un joli plateau avec des morceaux d'ananas et des sauces a mettre dessus si tu veux. J'ai essayé un vinaigre avec des échalotes et ce qui devait etre du piment fort et c'était somptueux.
Je me suis assise au bar, a l'ombre, et j'ai profité de la belle météo, de la bonne humeur de tous. Les huîtres étaient delicieuses.
Il faut compter 2.5- 3$ par huitre. C'est le même prix si tu emportes ou tu manges sur place, avec juste le pourboire pour les ouvreurs a rajouter.

This is not a true steakhouse that focuses on various cuts and grades of meat nor is it a trendy, new American restaurant.  It is what one would expect from a Four Seasons property.

Regardless of what time you show up for your reservation (early or on time), you will be offered a seat in their comfortable lounge and given the time to order a drink.  It actually sets the mood for a good dinner.

The Kobe beef tartare is perfect.  Classic in every respect.  The spinach salad is also very good and classically prepared.

It goes without saying that any of their steaks are good.  Each is paired with an accompanying jus that matches very well with the slight differences in flavor of each cut of steak.  Their shortribs, while delicious, are not as good as that prepared at CraftSteak.

Be sure to try the truffle baked potato as a shared side.

I cannot speak to the deserts.  I have eaten here many times but never made it that far.

The slides and kids' area is well staffed although a tad bit micromanaged. I get it because safety MUST be a priority but there is a fine line that must be hard to dance around. We went in the middle of the week and the lines weren't terrible, but as the day wore on, it got pretty crowded. The Lazy River is a bit TOO lazy for my taste, but the wave pool is fun and the little kids' play area is just right for a variety of age groups. 

Here are the tips I was given to make W-n-W a fun visit that won't break the bank. 

1) Get there early so you can get a spot in the shade. This is critical because well...Arizona is hot. (duh)

2) Pack your own lunch in a cooler to leave in your car. When you want to eat, go out to the car and enjoy a picnic lunch there. This saved me AT LEAST $100 because food is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. 

3) You CAN bring in sealed water bottles to the park. Sippy cups have to be empty so unless you are breastfeeding, don't expect your little ones to have their juices or anything like that brought in.

4) WEAR FLIP FLOPS or AQUA SOCKS. The ground is searing and when you are waiting to get on some of these slides, your feet will melt off--literally-if you aren't wearing shoes. 

5) Save-Around guide has discount coupons if you're only going once and Luke AFB has discounts for Vets and current military. However, if you are planning to go multiple times this summer, the summer pass is worth it. 

6) Only bring in what you absolutely need. Lockers are pricey and if you buy your tickets online, you won't even need to bring in your wallet and can lock it in the trunk of your car. 

7) Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. Oh and sunscreen.",2013-06-29 23:42:01

It was the first ""boil"" that we've been to. After thinking long and hard about all the plastic that would be used, we went. My hubby said that the plastic bags used are biodegradable but are they just the type that break up into a million tiny plastic pieces? Or are they compostable or made of corn and are truly eco-friendly?  I forgot to ask. 

Other than being bothered by the amount of plastic used (bibs, gloves, bags) the quality of the seafood was quite good. We tried the Good Catch seasoning and it was very tasty especially if you like a bit of spice (Cajun) and loads of garlic!  We had the clams and snow crab legs in that flavour. The shrimp was garlic butter flavoured which was also very yummy!  I ended up dipping the shrimp into the Good Catch sauce. 

If you want to avoid plastic, the fish and chips is a good alternative. It is served in a basket with a piece of paper as a liner. The Cajun fries were pretty good. The two generously sized fish pieces were nicely battered (light and crispy).  If we do return, I'll avoid the bags by ordering this.

For sides, we found the Brussels sprouts to be slightly undercooked and over priced. Corn was ok, perhaps not in season as they had no sweetness. Also $1 for a quarter of a cob wasn't quite worth it either but we need our veggies. Thankfully there was the seasoning to make up for that. 

All-in-all we liked the flavour but questioned if bags are necessary when the food could be seasoned by other means and placed on plates?  I'm sure it wouldn't affect the flavour. I understand that's all the craze now having seafood in bags but what's the environmental impact??  Not sure if we will go back because of this.",2017-03-29 03:47:07

Pricing wise, the pints are not too bad, but they sure ask a lot for some of their bottled beers.

The brisket is good, but that's about it. I didn't have the best experience at THIS Jessie Rae's BBQ because I felt that my order was wrong and the rest of the food was just okay.  Overall, I'm not dissing Jessie Rae's BBQ.  I'm dissing Jessie Rae's BBQ inside Cactus Jacks.  I'll just have to try their original location.  Until then, a very generous 3 stars is all they get from me.  

The Food:
-House Hold of Three: This is supposed to be a huge sandwich with brisket, pulled pork, and a smoked sausage.  Instead, I got an average sized bun with pulled pork and chicken.  My order was wrong and since I was craving brisket, I was a bit disappointed.  I brought my order to the bartender and he stated that my order IS the House Hold of Three.  Well, they better fix their menu then.  Look at my pictures. I see chicken in my pictures, not brisket or smoked sausage.  Fail!  The good news was that I was able to try the brisket since my girlfriend got it. The brisket is good and I recommend it. 

-The Pulled Pork:  Not the best.  Maybe a little more sauce is needed to hide the taste of grease. 

-The Chicken:  I didn't order this, but ate it anyway.  It was just okay.

-The Mac n' Cheese:  Small, a little pasty, and bland. 

-The Baked Beans:  Besides the brisket, this was my favorite. Very rich and hearty. 

The Service:
The main dining area was closed off and I'm not sure if they typically have servers.  They didn't on the day that we went so we gave our orders to the bartender.  Our food didn't take too long to be served.  I still feel that my order was wrong. 

The Establishment:
Located inside Cactus Jacks.  Keep in mind that you're in a bar, which also means you'll be dining with the cigarette smokers. 

Tips:  
-Try their original location.  They have all the great reviews.

keJURCE0Fznwggt19sJZFQ,7OjUhdATOsekdIQSE6TS4A,ftvZ6BVmbZndKcVPEdakIQ,4,3,3,2,"GENERAL NOTES
An arepa is a Venezuelan corn-bread like pita thing stuffed with delicious meats and veggies. The meat is generally the kind you'd scoop out of a chafing dish with a large ice cream scooper. You can get lots of different things on the arepa but the most common inclusions are beans, plantains, cheese and avocado. They are moderately sized and delicious.

The arepa itself is just the cornbread thing and you can get it one the side of a platter which just contains the toppings on a plate. These are bigger and also delicious. 

The also apparently offer breakfast arepas. Most likely delicious. 

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Pabellon Arepa - shredded flank steak, beans, cheese, sweet plantain

It's a small wet baseball of delicious shredded meat with the listed toppings and although sort of messy, this is a big win. I was a little dissatisfied in paying $9.50 for this and I didn't get $9.50 full but it was very tasty. 

I'd be tempted to try the Pabellon Caraqueno (platter) version of this for $12.50 as you get that much more of everything...except the arepa! (you only get a 1/2)

LOCATION NOTES
North side of Queen just West of Augusta. Cafe style seating for 15-20. 

SERVICE NOTES
I always feel like I'm getting something authentic if the person serving me has what I believe is an authentic accent. Our server was great, very knowledge and helpful and said everything in a wonderfully difficult to understand Venezuelan accent. It was a little slow for a cafe but her helpfulness more than made up for that. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
Our server had that weird, extra terrestrial-looking hotness to her that made me flash back to being really weirded out by myself as a 14 year old for sort of being attracted to the women of Star Trek. Is it wrong to like aliens? I mean, they're not humans and I was under the impression that everything non-human was off the table, at least in terms of social acceptance.

Now, i wouldn't be filling the whole cafe with vapor but i love to vape with a good cup of coffee and since there's no problem vaping here i believe this is my favorite cafe.

Short but sweet. Definitely give their coffee a good go if you're in the area. Friendly customer service and great tasting coffee in a home-y and comfortable shop. Will definitely be back",2014-01-01 21:59:20

Most of our friends and family are of Irish heritage. So, when we moved here we needed to find the nearest and best Irish Pub. Where else would we take our friends. So my husband and I stopped in for lunch to try it out. 
It was completely empty and completely silent, yet it took the waitress/bartender 15 minutes to come to our table. There was a short menu with only one Irish item on it, Shepard's pie. My husband ordered it because, one he loves it, second we are trying an Irish pub. After a few more minutes she comes back and tells us she doesn't have the ingredients for Shepard's Pie. He ended up with a boring, badly cooked, unseasoned burger. I got the Reuben which had hacked up corned beef it was both sliced and chopped so the texture was unpleasant, and the entire sandwich was salty and soggy. 
For a bar it didn't have a drink menu with any signature drinks, the bartender had no suggestions, I ended up just getting ice tea, I believe it's the first time ever I ordered a non-alcoholic drink in an Irish Pub. 
I won't be returning and I am still on the hunt for an Irish Pub to frequent. Adding Irish flags, shamrocks and Guinness posters doesn't make you an Irish Pub.",2017-09-10 01:36:28

This crepe shop has a whole lot of personality that screams black and purple. Its very intimate and romantic (great for sunday brunch dates or coffee shop dates. Wink wink fellas!)

It is a petite shop, and you better believe the seats never stay empty! There is also an outdoor seating area which is a nice spot to have Saturday breakfast when all the cool vintage cars are parked outside. It makes a great start for conversation!

I came with my mom who absolutely adores this place (if my mom is willing to a take a trip down to this area then you know its for a good reason!) 

She ordered the Berry Delight crepe ($7.50) and you get the berry works! It includes blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries with whipped cream on top. Its berry delightful! (Insert drum roll here) If you don't want a sweet and heavy crepe this would be a great option. Its filled with fruit, which won't be filling to your tummy. I picked the Monkey ($6.50). It's a typical choice for me since my favorite crepe includes nutella, bananas, and strawberries. The Monkey has bananas, nutella, and whipped cream. I also added strawberries as an additional ingredient. I intent to come back again, and step outside of the box to try the rest of the menu items. They also have great Savory Menu with crepe items that have pepperoni, spinach, mozarella, tomato ingredients, and more!

Lastly, a great pair with our crepes was the Mimosa Trio Sampler ($10.00) which provides your choice of three various mimosas to taste that you can pick from the menu. Its a perfect sample size especially if you're in it for taste and less on getting crunk in the AM or afternoon. (Fellas this would be a fun option if you bring a date with you! Hint. Hint) We chose the blood orange, guava, and cherry mimosa to sample. My favorite was the blood orange! Filled with a variety flavors on the menu and they are all such original selections. I never knew that there was a variety of ways to make mimosas besides OJ until now!

How fun! You can watch them make your crepe on the tv as well. So you know exactly when your order is coming!

The Carbon Bar fit the bill and had good reviews to boot. This place boasts themselves to be a BBQ place..errr...maybe I'm spoiled by the awesome BBQ places in Michigan but BBQ it is not at CB. 

I had a seat at the bar. I was initially ignored by the male bartender. Finally the female came over and gave me a menu. She was really nice and attentive. I got the pit fired BC salmon and a glass of red wine.

The food arrived after not long. The salmon was very tender but the flavor was rather non-existent. The ""asparagus"" was basically shavings with some lettuce mixed in. Lastly and the worst, was the ""fingerling potatoes"". Actually, there was one potato and it had clearly been cooked and cooled, then microwaved for my dinner. Potatoes don't taste right after they've been reheated and this was certainly the case. When you're charging $25 an entree, it should be well executed. 

I was still starving after eating my tiny piece of salmon, one potato and shaved asparagus so I got the candy bar. It's a higher price than what is listed on the website and while it was delicious, it was literally one bite. I could have eaten another additional meal after this meal, that's how little it filled me. I did consider the brisket but it seems as though they have no sauce they serve it with, at least that was my understanding. You have to have some house made sauces if you are going to serve brisket.

This place smells so freaking good! Like, for once, I've stumbled in a place that was both hip AND authentic AND tastes great. It's small and humble, with prices on par with Chipotle, so I expect something great. 

I went with a green chili (pork) burrito with black beans. I can say that while the beans & rice are good, the main attraction falls flat. It's not spicy. It's barely flavorful! what a letdown. I found myself dousing it with the green habanero sauce featured at the table. 

Oh yeah, don't expect any sort of complimentary salsa bar. Salsa (and chips) will cost you a bit extra, and if you're going to shell out the $3, you might as well just drop the same amount for a better burrito + chips + salsa combo at a place like La Santisima...or even Qdoba.

Scottsdale-based Square One Concepts (proprietors of other valley restaurants such as Wasted Grain and Bourbon & Bones) is the brainchild behind this growing chain of burger joints (10 strong as of when I write this) which have received mixed reviews from those I've spoken to.  My Dad wanted a good burger for lunch on Memorial Day and it just so happened that CBC's central Phoenix location was open nearby so off we went to satisfy our curiosity (and hopefully a burger craving).

The central Phoenix location sits along 7th Street between Missouri and Bethany Home Road, alongside a large and growing list of new restaurants lining this stretch of the valley.  Burger joints are a pretty easy find in CenPho so one would think CBC would need to offer something unique to survive in this saturated market.  CBC's answer?  Variety.  Both the food and beverage menus are impressively extensive with about two dozen burger options (including the ability to build your own), plus upwards of 100 beers to choose from.  And that doesn't even account for the lengthy wine and cocktail options.  Or the hot dog, sandwich, or appetizer options.  Seriously, reading through this long menu is tantamount to reading those long binder menus at the Cheesecake Factory.  And while it may seem a bit overwhelming, CBC doesn't veer too far from the types of items you would likely expect to see at a sports bar setup.  There's just a lot more of them to choose from than say a Zipp's or a Twin Peaks.

Anyhow, I started off with a Scottsdale Blonde Ale for my beer (one of about 20 AZ produced microbrews on the menu).  After looking up and down at the burger menu, my eyes stopped and transfixed on one burger in particular.  The Pastrami Burger.  Pastami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and thousand island dressing atop a 1/2 pound burger patty and sandwiched between a toasted artisan bun.  Came with a side of twice cooked lightly seasoned potato chips.  Total cost for the food, beer, tax and tip came to about $28.  I was actually really pleased with the bun they used as it held together just fine despite the inevitable mess a piled high burger like this can make.  The burger was also delicious, though as a point of comparison, I would give valley favorite Rocket Burger the edge in the Pastrami Burger pecking order.  Rocket's version has more meat and tastes just as good for a cheaper price.  Still, I'd give CBC's version pretty high marks for their version.

I've seen some Yelpers state that this location has bad servers.  We experienced nothing of the sort as our server was friendly, attentive, and efficient.  I won't disagree that the prices for the food here are pretty steep compared to most sports bars and thus why I can't give this place a 5 star rating.  But taken as a whole, I was impressed with the food I had, the variety of options to choose from, the stellar sports bar setup with plenty of TVs for big game days, and with the staff that took care of us.  You can find plenty of other cheaper sports bar options in CenPho and around the valley.  But during happy hour and on game days, CBC might very well become one of my go to's.",2017-05-29 22:52:39

Fried chicken w/ watermelon and waffles ($32): The fried chicken was full of flavor and quite juicy on the inside.  The waffles were good, but the whiskey syrup was definitely a bit too much...especially if you've been shootin' whiskey all trip long...

Burger ($18): I wasn't a huge fan of this burger.  While the flavors were good, it was too much.  This tasted like something you would order at the heart attack grill...full of grease, meat, bacon, and sauce.  I'm more of a traditional burger guy, though I do make exceptions.  Because they add pork to their patty meat, they have to cook the patty medium well, which made it dry.  For comparison, Slater's 50/50 has the same concept but pulls it off better.  The fries that came with the dish were fried perfectly.

When I saw the sign go up initially I was super excited to see what this shop was going to bring.  As most of you know in Vegas butcher shops are few and far between.  Most of us do the grocery shopping thang and wrap it up in one trip.  Here is your reason to make the extra stop....

Walking in the place was rather small but there were other customers in there.  There were two guys working-one working the counter and the butcher in the back. They had anything you could think of for meat.  Seriously stuff I have never heard of. The display was set up nicely.  They had several styles of rubs that you could purchase along with different kind sauces.  They did have a small deli section with Boars Head meats and cheeses.  I am a Boars Head snob.  It is simply the best.  Nothing compares to it.  Quality here is key.

I looked around and immediately noticed marinated carne asada.  I am a big fan of the carne asada at Cardenas so I was anxious to try their version.  (Cardenas is way out of my way).  Instead of the carne we opted for the chicken asada $5 lb - I thought that was a great price.  The marinade was a spicy version which is always a plus.  I asked if they carried the rub they used and he said it was their special recipe.  I ordered some skewered herb and garlic shrimp that were $4 each, some lobster-crab stuffed mushrooms $1.00 each and bacon wrapped cheese stuffed jalepenos $1.50 each.  They might be high in price for some things but I thought it was pretty reasonable for quality with an educated conversation and recommendation.  The guy at the counter was super helpful and so easy and nice to speak with. I mentioned that his place was just on ROTD from my buddy Rachel B. two days ago and he was pleasantly surprised.  

So what it all comes down to is how they turned out cooked.  Right?  Everything was amazing.  The chicken was so delicious with an obvious spicy kick.  The ""secret"" marinade held onto the chicken giving it a flavorful taste.  The chicken was even great left over. The shrimp was ok-a little on the bland side but needed a little salt.  The jalepenos were ok.  I wasn't sure how to cook them so I'm sure it was my fault.  A lot of the cheese oozed out.  I will definitely ask next time.  The mushrooms the BF loved and they sure looked great. (I didn't have any-not a mushroom girl)

There are so many things I want to try here. I will definitely be back this weekend for another potential grillin adventure.

The facility is indeed state of the art. There are two ice rinks and in between is a restaurant/bar called MacKenzie River Pizza Grill & Pub with great views of both rinks. There is a Golden Knight store where you can buy team logo clothes and souvenirs and surprisingly skates and equipment. This is also the headquarters for the VGK too. Everyone we encountered were super nice.  Check online for the schedule as they offer open skating and leagues. The atmosphere throughout the facility (as it was at the VGK game at TMOBILE) is full of excitement!! Thank you Bill Foley!!!,2017-10-06 00:37:35

AAAp_fjLbVqScy0Ht7uSyw,VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,3,11,2,3,"I had a tough decision on booking Le Cirque for dinner, a few hours before Le Reve at Wynn.  The restaurant has been around 18 years, virtually day one since Bellagio opened.  Very good Yelp reviews (though none among my Yelp friends), a Michelin Star, and top rankings from various local ""best Vegas restaurants"" lists and blogs.  The first red flag was my coworker buddy who ate here a week before who commented meh - French food that does not compare to Le Pigeon in Portland.  Nonetheless, I took the gamble and booked here anyways.

Overall I felt the dinner was good, but not excellent. I liked the small, intimate restaurant next to the Bellagio fountains, and the cute circus-themed art and colorful decorations.  Service was excellent along with the wine glasses suggested by our sommelier.  It was the execution of the 5-course tasting menu that was slightly uneven and the quality-to-price ratio that drove me to the 3-star rating overall.  The 5-course menu gives you more dishes, but portions seem smaller than going ala carte or many even the 3-course menu.  Plus they have several dishes with price supplements that can easily increase the price!

Excellent aspects:
+ The bread service.  Wow the coffee-chocolate bread sounds like dessert and is borderline sweet, but man did that taste good.  Next is the bacon roll!

+ Australian Truffle Risotto.  Superb, creamy, and surprisingly not to rich.  Several generous pieces of shaved black truffle but expect to pay a whopping $40 supplement.

+ Foie Gras of course, and it works so well with cherries and cherry amaretto sauce.

+ Service from the waitstaff and sommelier were definitely friendly and Michelin-worthy.

Good aspects:
+ Potato stuffed sea bass was a small portion, so perhaps that is why it seemed slightly overcooked and you really need to eat it with the wine reduction.  Excellent leeks!

+ Diver scallop was perfectly cooked and served in a shell with lobster bisque.  Its just one for a $19 supplement, so a bit pricey.

+ Colorado lamb - Meaty and cooked well.  I liked the veggie sides and the sauce.  

+ Chilled Corn Soup - Interesting and colorful, and has some crunch from the buckwheat popcorn and some sweetness from vanilla snow.

+ The raspberry parfait dessert was nice, with lychees and raspberries adding a nice surprise.

Mediocre aspects:
+ 3-oz A5 Wagyu Beef - At a $105 supplement we were hoping to be blown away, but sadly while some portions were indeed juicy and soft, the ends seemed drier and overcooked.  The A5 we had at Carmel's Aubergine (a 4 oz) literally melted in our mouth, while the Le Cirque version required some chewing.  Flavors were good, but the execution on texture didn't seem up to par.

+ Panna Cotta - presentation was beautiful, and the custard was good.  Somehow biting into the pears in the dish gave me the feeling that they felt canned, but that may be just me.

Overall, I think Le Cirque is good, but for the price I think L'Atelier is a far better option.  With all the supplements, our 5-course tasting menu with 2 glasses wine, 1 coffee, and tax and tip came to about $600 for two.  The 10-course tasting menu at L'Atelier was less than that and there every course was awesome.",2016-08-14 13:33:26

Salad was $15 which was not big for what it was. Avocado and cherry tomatoes with guacamole smeared on the bowl and a dash of crumbled feta. I wouldn't get it again as it's not worth it.

A good spot for dates and gatherings with friends. I've came here at 7:30pm~and there was just enough people so that it wasn't awkwardly dead. Place starts to get busy closer to 11 but not so much that you're thrown in a crowd. You can mingle with others or privately carry your own conversation. Cheap drinks before 10pm and waitress comes around and serves you Cheetos/chips on the house. 

Just like entering in someone's fancy home. There's a living room area with a bar on the side and couches around where you can play simple party games like Jenga, headbands and the like. 

Next room is a games room with jitz and free arcade-like games with a bar at the back too. However, the machines to be overplayed a lot and don't work properly. It wasn't so busy on a Thursday so there wasn't anyone really mingling in this room. 

The atmosphere was just a really relaxed, dimly-lit, and lux. Games were not the focus but just a great complimentary. I hope it remains as chill as it is now without the big crowds.",2016-02-13 05:35:42

They never had some of the beer on tap; excusable but then their domestic beer tasted watered down. I ordered the mixed grill (surf and turf); which had chicken/beef kebabs ; tandoori chicken , and lamb chops. The highlight was definitely the Tandoori Lamb chops; if I do ever go back, it would be for the that. Everything else was pretty generic. 

Ordered the cheese naan for $4 ; felt let down as the item did not have the value. Thin naan with cheese in between. There are several other indian places in the neighbourhood with a lot more flavor.

I know there's a thing with the various Rosati's around town, like some owned by one branch of the family and others owned by another branch of the family....I'm not quite sure how it shakes out except that this one and the one at I-17 and Thunderbird seem to be run the same and have the same food so those are the only two I go to. 

Oh, yeah, the food.  So, I'm from Chicago, which is where this chain began, and that also means that I am extremely particular when it comes to pizza.  And I don't know where the mythology started that ""Chicago style"" pizza is thick crust or pan?  No.  The original Chicago style pizza is actually served on a thin crust and cut into squares.  The secondary Chicago style pizza, that actually didn't really take off until maybe the late 1970s/early 1980s, is what folks around here call ""deep dish"" pizza but is actually in Chicago referred to as ""stuffed.""  There's your food history lesson for today.

So the quintessential Chicago style pizza is a thin crust topped with Italian sausage.  CRUMBLED Italian sausage (to those doofuses who want to slice it).  And, quite frankly, Rosatti's is the only place in town that does it worth a hoot.  Now there's that new place, Lou what's-his-name, but I never went to his place in Chicago and to be quite honest, I'm not rushing to try his place here.  

So, bottom line:  the pizza at Rosati's is authentic and delicious Chicago-style pizza.  Also, their Italian Beef is the only beef in town besides Portillo's that's worth eating.  Case closed.

PS:  There are some places around that make these things, I think they might call them wood-fired pizza or some such thing?  Places like Fired Pie and I don't know who else.  Some of them turn out some food that is quite delicious.  But I'm sorry, unless it has a tomato sauce, Italian sausage (or in rare cases pepperoni) and mozzarella cheese, it is not a pizza.  Whatever it is may be delicious, but it is not a pizza.  Just so ya know, ya' know?",2016-07-06 11:20:01

I have to admit I am always a bit skeptical on the hype that exists over any restaurants but even with this skepticism I was looking forward to the opportunity to dine at this joint. I made my way over on a Tuesday. The interior is broken up into two floors with tables and a bar on the first floor as well as the second floor. I opted to go to the second floor to grab a seat at the bar. The décor is a cool and has a hustle and bustle vibe to it. The first floor has a pretty impressive wall of drinks stacked up against it with a nice chandelier thing hanging. 

The few times ive been here, I was always immediately greeted when sitting at the bar and pretty shortly thereafter provided a menu for perusal. They have a pretty solid array of food and drinks so the last few visits have been me asking the bartender for their recommendations for drinks/food. These guys are executing solid cocktails and drinks and were able to meet my random requests for recommendations. After a bit of perusing of the menu, I immediately gravitated towards the pig candy and the dirty pasta based on all the rave reviews. Both were really solid and definitely let me feel I was enjoying the finer cuisine in life. The pig candy is delicious and has the perfect compliments of spices and sweetness to it and is perfectly married with the pork belly. The dirty pasta has the perfect amount of ingredients and is made perfectly as well. It is tossed with ground duck , sage, and pecorino romano making it just heavenly. The noodles were cooked to perfection and I think I literally had to stop myself from licking the plate clean. I have also had the opportunity to try the steak here which was cooked perfectly and delicious with the right amount of tenderness behind it.

Then it wouldn't even stay up if pulled up manually. We called our home warranty company and they sent a tech out. They informed us that A1 had used the wrong springs, didn't tighten the bolts and put the bolts in crooked! This was quite the shocker since we paid over $510 for the service A1 provided. We called A1 the same day to report it and see if they could send someone out to look and fix the shoty work.

He checked everything, denied the springs were the wrong ones, said the bolts were loose because over time that happens, but admitted the bolts were hung crooked. Said he had to call his manager to see if he should fix them. After a lengthy talk with the manager on the phone he decided he would not be fixing the crooked bolts without payment.

I literally know of one other place that has it.  Yes I know it's pan fried shrimp in condensed milk and mayo. But when you tasted it for the first time at 16 while vacationing in San Francisco you kind of associate it with that magic feeling of eating some ""exotic"" in an exotic place.  I get nostalgic sometimes, this place fills that niche, and for that I'm grateful. The only thing it's missing is the insanely hot little peppers that came as a garnish at the place I first tried the dish. Also the sushi is pretty top notch.  All in all give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.",2017-01-16 01:51:21

It's very pricey (one chicken breast is $5). For the amount of money you pay, I would expect a little more flavor (doesn't seem like they season the chicken before they batter it) so remember to bring your salt and pepper shakers with you.",2016-11-13 16:44:42

I don't like seafood so I only come here when my family goes, but the chicken wings are so worth it. Odd that it's my favorite thing on the menu but the size is perfect and they're always cooked perfectly and packed with flavor. My family always gets shrimp, catfish, and gumbo. And they all say the flavor is amazing also.
I think the price is amazing. This is my go-to restaurant to treat my family to. For 6 people getting appetizers, drinks, and main coarse meals... The price is always at or below 100 which is awesome for me because we order so much food for so many people! Definitely the best bang for your buck.",2017-05-15 22:50:10

Fresco lunch. I never even noticed the patio in the last visit but it is awesome. It's tucked in between the buildings but doesn't disappoint. There is a giant fireplace, cushy chairs, plenty of umbrellas etc. 

I had a tasty meatball sandwich with delightful truffle fries. The fries were not extra oily from being drizzled....instead they were crisp but still truffly! How nice! 

I definitely recommend lunch or dinner on the patio. Left happy and craving satiated.",2013-10-28 04:36:47

We went in around 10am and were seated. Our food and drinks were fantastic and, while pricey, represented good value. The quality and quantity were not wanting in the least. 

Finally, the service. My God, the service. It. Was. Amazing. The waitress knew the menu inside-out and gave some very astute recommendations. The couple points she didn't know--I ask esoteric questions on occasion; I'm curious--she promptly found answers for. 

We had a fantastic time and hope to produce enough income to become regulars here. Great food, great service, great experience. Thanks!",2014-11-15 23:32:54

Went with coworkers to Jimmy's Hot Dogs for lunch, was kinda like um I don't know, but I'll go, cuz either you like hot dogs or you don't and most of the time I don't.  On the way to Jimmys I was reading their Yelp reviews and saw most of them are 4 to 5 star reviews, so I was thinking um this might be ok. When I got there the line was out the door, but it did move fast, the menu is simple and yes the fries are very fresh, I was watching the dude turn a raw potato into my fries, no frozen stuff there!

The hot dog, let me tell you, it's a Chicago dog, it has peppers, onions, tomatoes, pickles on this great roll, so dang tasty!!   Oh and fries always comes with your hot dog, and you want to know the even crazier part, I got my hot dog & fries for $3.25, WHAT!! You say, that's right $3.25 for a dang tasty dog & fresh french fries, man you can't go wrong!

I wished it was nice patio weather.  The place was very cozy and a little uncomfortable padded banko seating.  If the tables were only several inches higher, it would have been better!  

First off, we ordered Baked Brie and Raspberry  wrapped in puff pastry hors d'oeuvres with a side of grapes.  A couple of glasses of light and fruity red Portugal wines paired well. 

""Can I have some lemonade?"", nope, no lemonade.  ""How about Sprite?"", sorry, no Sprite.  So sad to see the look on cutie pie's face.  Even wine bars would have had something for him to drink.  ""Okay, water is fine.""  He gloomly said.  We promised him an Italian soda next door at Lola's.  He cheered up.

Killer pizzas, so I've heard.  We decided to order the Mozarella, basil (pesto instead), white truffle oil pizza.  The crust is amazingly toasty outside and soft and flaky inside.  Good 14"" inches for $12 pie!   We added Risotto with manchego cheese/chorizo.  It was very, very, very rich!  It was so rich, I wanted to reach for some bread to sop it up!

We were so full and carbo-ed up!  We didn't balance out our meals very well.   Good thing we took the lightrail downtown.  We needed to do a lot of walking after all that eating!

Kudos to the chef and the hostess/server, they were absolutely wonderful.

AKByTWqP5gMd9oi_BqMeaw,FEgL-l6xXolYrlvzcUY75Q,go_uJsNgk2WCRtl5m-v72g,1,0,0,0,"To preface the experience I would like to highlight some issues before the issue of the entree itself, the service. While I give credit to the male server on his friendliness what I was having trouble figuring out was whether it was busy, he was new, or just flustered.

When we sat down we waited approximately 5 minutes for him to come to the table to take a drink order. Not knowing who would be our server I watched a few people go back and forth, no one really acknowledging that we had been helped. The guy who ended up eventually coming to our table was observed in the dining room running food back and forth between tables seemingly rushed and out of his element. 

By the time he actually came we had looked at the menu long enough to want an appetizer which was ordered with the drinks. The drinks, while only waters took just as much time to arrive then when we were waited to be greeted. By then a party of 4 and a party of 6 next to us had been seated well after we had with a different server had already had drinks and was starting the ordering process. 

The appetizer and salad/breadsticks took time to get out. Seemed disorganized in the planning of that. While I indicated I had no preference as to what came first I just wanted something to eat, after waiting a bit too long. 

At some point we ordered our 2 chicken scampis and ate what we had until they arrived....whenever that was. 

Everytime I have gone to Olive Garden I have ALWAYS gotten nothing but that entree. I've been familiar with its taste and more importantly its presentation. Lightly browned seasoned chicken, cooked vegetables, and a generous serving of scampi sauce. 

When we both order the exact same thing each time we go to this location it NEVER FAILS. Every. Single. Time. One plate is fine and as it should be, while the other is bland, dry, chicken burnt, and has barely any sauce on it. Clearly they STILL can't figure out how to properly cook double in one pan and serve both equally. 

The other major issue was the server. By the time our entrees arrived the dining room was half empty and seemed less busy then it was 30 or minutes prior. After for the THIRD TIME of getting a poorly executed scampi I felt I needed to voice how dissatisfied I was with it and the past times in general....but I couldn't right away....because it took over 5 minutes for  our server to come back and check on how we liked it. UGH. 

Whenever he did come back from doing whatever it was he was doing, in between passing our table up multiple times to check in on others I noted I was not happy with the lack of sauce, while my partner had a good amount of it. He offered to go back to the kitchen to get more sauce. That took longer as well. Spooning sauce didn't seem to help either. It was them when eating the chicken that the side laying on the pasta was dark brown borderline well done with bits of burnt end pieces in parts of the dish. 

Still pretty shocked he would even suggest to ""get more sauce"". WHY?! It's already cold from waiting for you so long. Why not go back and tell them redo it THE RIGHT WAY?!  

By then I was just done. Done eating, done with waiting too long in between anything to ask or complain, done trying to figure out why this place is just horrible...just lost whatever appetite or need to enjoy what I had. But had to wait more than a few minutes AGAIN for him to come back to ask if we either wanted a box or dessert. He observed I hadn't touched much of it and I further expressed my disdain after finding the chicken the way it was. He offered for me to pick another dish but by that time all the time in between we just wanted to leave. He apologized, and left it at that. Nothing else. Just walked off.",2014-06-30 15:39:29
