The pizza was pizza, nothing over the top but greasy and was savory on the taste buds like pizza normally is... BUT THE FRIES WERE AMAZING! 

If you are like me you enjoy quality but also appreciate quantity. I have never seen a single order of fries this large anywhere! And by God it was deliciously greasy and good! 

Again it's been a long time and I don't eat that type of food much anymore but I think one day soon I will return and enjoy this gem of a restaurant once again! 

Get the fries bro... Just get the fries",2014-12-26 21:00:13
ByMvIz_-lGnHZL8ZKisGIA,LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,2,1,2,1,"I have certainly had better, especially at these prices. 

Fried lobster, grilled branzino, salmon sashimi salad, deviled eggs, tuna sashimi, and a cocktail for $105. Was i satisfied when i left? Not really, as i have had far better meals for half the price for two. The best of the dishes for me was the deviled eggs at $11, but Carson's Kitchen's eggs are better and for less money. The grilled branzino was the typical preparation of lemon and rosemary in the center and grilled which i do myself at home, so i expect to have something a bit more when i come to a restaurant known for creativity? Salmon salad was, just ok as i didn't feel like the greens added much if anything to the small cuts of salmon. Yonaka does a salmon with micro greens with larger cuts of fish and more balance, and again for less money. Fried lobster was tasty, but as another mentioned certainly not worth the price tag for the size of the serving. 

I think there is a theme to my review, which is i see/taste your food and i have had better and for less elsewhere. I will pay the money for the right meal and return regularly at that, but this was one of those meals that left me feeling unsatisfied. Maybe the happy hour gets a lot of play, and that's where a lot of the hype comes from so maybe give that a look. But for my dinner on this night, it just wasn't working for me. Side note, our waitress was quiet friendly and was pleasant during our visit.",2018-03-26 23:18:43

Prices are pretty decent too, beers are about $7. Cigar prices vary, but it's not a smoke shop so that was no real surprise. I had a server the other night which was a bit confused, but most of my experiences here had been exceptional and I will continue to frequent this location.

I did have an experience here once where a woman at a surrounding table asked me to please stop blowing smoke hear her/her table. I may have casually mentioned that although she might have not noticed, the sign did say ""cigar bar"" upon walking in....thought that was pretty funny.

I will continue to be a regular!",2013-11-27 18:25:10

Just a quick interjection, usually when I review places I take into account service.  However, since I liked the food so much here, I am ignoring our terrible waitress that we had and giving this place its deserved 5-star rating.

To start out with, my table ordered the nachos.  They were devoured in under 3 minutes.  They were delicious.  Not too much meat and cheese piled on top.  It was the perfect amount.  However, there were tiny amounts of guacamole and sour cream with the plate.  But the cheesy meaty goodness made me forget about the lack of guac and cream.

Of course for my main course I had to go with creating my own burger.  It was delicious.  I got a beef burger with basically anything I could throw onto it.  My only nitpicking here was that the cooks seem to go short on some of the toppings.  For example I got two little pieces of avocado, and bits of bacon.  But once again, the ""melt-in-your-mouth"" taste of the burger canceled out my complaints.  

The chips that came with the burger were also delicious.  I dipped those bad boys in ranch dressing.. ohhh boyyy I was feeling good.

Even the side of veggies I got were delicious.  Granted I thought there was going to be more than just two different veggies on the plate for $3.50, but yet again, the deliciousness canceled out the complaint.

Finally, my table ordered two different shakes: Caramel Pretzel and Smores.  Both were so good that i took the honor of sitting for an extra 10 minutes to make sure i slurped out every last drip.

Burgatory was defiantly everything I hoped it would be (besides the terrible waitress).  It was a great meal, and I could easily see myself taking the 45minute drive out there in the next week just to have another burger.",2011-08-16 01:03:26

Mister Steer est une excellente alternative pour ceux qui souhaitent redécouvrir le vrai goût d'un burger à l'américaine, et ça dure depuis plus de 50 ans. Quand la serveuse m'a demandé quel type de cuisson je désirais, j'ai compris que je n'étais pas dans une simple gargote à pelotes. Il y a un spécial chaque jour. Ça a bien tombé pour moi, car j'ai eu droit au spécial cheesburger, que j'ai commandé bien cuit. L'assiette est accompagnée d'un monticule de frites tourbillonnées (assez bonnes dans le ketchup) d'une salade et d'une boisson gazeuse (root beer forever). Le burger nous arrive pratiquement dénudé, sauf si l'on le veut avec tomate,  fromage et oignons. Le reste des condiments (moutarde, ketchup, relish, cornichons à volonté (!) et vinaigrette pour la salade) repose sur la table. L'on a qu'à doser à notre goût.

La boulette est particulièrement petite et faite en hauteur, ce qui donne un hamburger relativement surélevé et dépourvu sur les flancs (ça coule de partout!). N'empêche que la viande est fraîche, goûteuse et juteuse à souhait. L'on le mange dans une ambiance américaine, s'apparentant aux «diner» des années 50. Le restaurant est immense; se déploie à une telle profondeur que j'ai eu de la misère à voir le bout d'où j'étais assis. Mon assiette m'a coûté une dizaine de dollars, ce qui est pas mal pour la qualité du burger. Je ne suis pas prêts à dire que c'est le meilleur au monde (c'est leur slogan, pas le mien), mais en tout cas, une chose est certaine, ce fut au-delà de mes attentes. J'ai bien mangé et me suis sali comme un chef...

The casual atmosphere, tremendous staff, great beer selection and decent food all added up to a solid experience.  This was part of a self-directed Pub Crawl in Gateway District.  By the time I hit Greenhouse I'd been to about 5 other spots so I was ready to relax a bit and have something to eat.  I had been saving the eating portion of the night for Greenhouse and I'm glad I did.  There's so much to try here and it's tough to rate a place as eclectic as Greenhouse on a couple items so I'll just say that the food I had was very good, but not blow you off the bar stool great.

I'm a bit of a late bloomer but there is a first time for everything, right? Shopping at Ikea was everything I thought it would be; big, modern, minimalist and unsurprising. Guided through the showroom maze, I ended up buying more than what I came for (good on you, Ikea marketing team!). Although I am aware Ikea isn't renown for its quality, I managed to find several kitchen and bathroom items which I'd been needing for a while. And so in that department, I am mostly satisfied.

Now, on Ikea's cafeteria food... Oh, the food... Where to begin? It made many years since I had witnessed such a sad selection of foodstuff stacked on metal shelves and platters that way. Extremely processed, as poor in taste as it is in nutrients, eating at Ikea felt like what I imagine dining at a Dollarama would: cheap and dirty. When I sat, I almost reached in my pocket for my phone to take a picture but then refrained. I did not want to immortalize this moment. I wanted it to be over with. Dear shoppers, do yourself and your health a favor; bring a lunch or eat elsewhere. You don't have to do this to yourself. I'm serious, you really don't have to!

Although I will still order Ikea furniture online, I will avoid going there as much as possible in the future. I will also stay far to resist the urge of setting on fire that poor excuse of a restaurant to save all future shoppers the ordeal of having to eat there.",2014-06-20 05:38:20

She was the girl of my dreams. Too bad I was with my college girlfriend at the time. She definitely snuffed out the flame that almost was ignited from the many sparks that were flying at our dinner table between me and the waitress. If I would have known how that relationship would have ended up, I would have been like Lefty from the song the place is named after, rode off into the sunset with the waitress.

The food has been good and fresh. But now I'm worried. The last two or three times I've been, there seems to be a management/employee problem. I've had to wait a much longer time than before, they didn't have water available for the longest time (I went ahead and just poured some tea), tables weren't wiped off. It was just kind of a mess the last time I went. The time before that I waited a really long time for a takeout. It made me late to where I was heading.

So bottom line is: I want you back Crisp - from the service standpoint. The food continues to be good. I will come back again but it would be great to have you back to where you were a year or so ago.",2016-06-29 13:11:11

I was staying downtown and didn't want the same ol' stuff you find everywhere, nor a buffet blah, so I fired up the app and found MTO. Just a few short blocks from downtown, it's a place that tourists can get to on foot if they want to leave the craziness, but it's great to see so many reviews from locals as well.

They seem to focus a lot on the brunch/breakfast aspect, and have a really great selection of simple lunches as well. Most people will talk about the breakfast and that seems to be their focus, but I was in desperate need of a salad after a heavy dinner the night before, and the light stroll with light fare was just what the doctor ordered.

Even though a cobb salad isn't exactly the lightest salad around, it was still perfect. Extremely generous portions of tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon, meat, and a hard-boiled egg. I polished it off completely, but really, you'll be able to share one. I also got a big bowl of fruit that seemed genuinely fresh. Strawberries, apple, blueberries; all in a cup. Your fruit may vary, depending on the season.

Most of all, though, I need to address that dressing. I'm in love with dill, and this dressing was packed with it. It was exquisitely dilled, and I couldn't get enough. I spread it over the salad (takeout comes with dressing on the side) and licked the little container clean. I haven't been this taken with a dressing in a long time, and I'll think it about it for a while after I'm back home.

Like I mentioned, I ordered the delivery right from the Yelp app. They also offered delivery, but I wanted some fresh air and it was a beautiful day. I'd love to come back from breakfast or brunch, as it seems they have a fresh twist on the classics.

Not as good as the best I've ever had in New York City but definitely well above average and better than Pita Jungle! Pitas tasted as they should, falafel and meats were moist and flavorful and the Arabic coffee was the perfect sweet dessert all by itself. They could add a few little extras to spice up their sandwiches like tomatoes and onions. I asked for some extra tahini and they quickly brought me a cup at no extra charge. I like that!

They seem a bit understaffed with employees going back and forth between the restaurant and the connected grocery store, so getting a waiter's attention can take a few minutes. Despite this, the service was okay. They don't tell you, but they won't give you a check...only a stub that you're supposed to take to the cashier yourself. It's laid back in that way, which is kind of nice. I only wish they had a napkin dispenser or a paper towel roll at the table because this kind of food uses up paper napkins fast and one is far from enough!

The skinny 
I have had back pain since I was a young lad and have visited specialist chiropractors and acupuncturist all have provided temporary relief and the dr's usually prescribe me Vicodin or soma for pain. Both pills make me sick and I am taking another pill for my stomach and the cycle began before I knew it I was taking 3-6 pills a day just for pain and other ailments. I discovered that marijuana provided enough for all my ailments that I may be able to sleep through the whole night and also the cbd's that are in marijuana helped with my pain. I was smoking illegally for years before I decided to protect myself. I was recommended this place by a friend who also has his card and I can't thank him enough, I brought in my medical records and cash for all fees was in and out within an hour or so. The dr was great took time to hear me out and understood my concerns and also explained the pros and cons about my card. I left there feeling like a million bucks like the weight of being arrested for trying to feel normal with no pain. 
The bad

This place sets itself apart by adding gourmet hot dogs to the mix. Plus the burger meat is different. Instead of beef patties, you get flattened steak cuts. I wasn't used to the thin sliced steak patties but it tastes pretty good all the same. 

I really enjoyed the oreo dirt custard. I now have an excuse to enjoy oreo dirt cake, but of course, this time instead of cake, it's a mix in for thick, creamy custard. 

The interior of this fast food restaurant is more fun than Culvers since they take the 1950s vibe pretty seriously. It reminds me of being inside a 5 and Diner.

Walking in you get the feel that this is the hotel of choice for the local rub a dubs.  The people hanging in the lobby for the free coffee.

My first problem with this hotel was not their fault.  My corporate travel provider told me I would have a queen sized bed.  Instead I got two twins. I haven't slept in a twin in over thirty years.  Talking to the front desk staff there isn't a single queen bed in the entire hotel.  I had to move the nightstand between the beds and push them together.  One of the maids put them back one day.

The rooms were well appointed and clean though.  Not as chic as the Hyatt, but quite decent.  One slight issue with the layout though, if I use the remote to turn on the tv in the bedroom, the tv in the living room turns on in the living room.

I had issues with the wifi.  It is incredibly slow.  To load a simple web site like google takes about two minutes.  Wifi speeds are slower than that of a 14.4 modem.  I couldn't really get any help from the front desk.

Beyond the clean room and the decent restaurant, I don't plan on staying here unless I can't avoid it.

I had a couple of dogs, and a carne asada taco.  I thought the dogs were very good!  If ever back in Tucson, I am definitely going back.  Anyways......I was excited when I heard that they were opening one here in Phoenix!

 A few months ago, I woke up on a Sunday morning and was craving a hot dog!  I saw that El Guero Canelo opened at 9am on Sundays.  I got in my car, drove down and was super excited to get an early morning breakfast of some Sonoran Dogs and a Mexican Coke.  I walk in the joint, stood there by the register for a good 3-4 minutes before anyone acknowledged me (workers definitely saw me standing there...I made eye contact with about 3 of them in the back, yet none of them ever called to anyone to let them know someone was wanting to place an order).  Finally a lady comes up to the register to take my order.  I ordered 2 Sonoran Dogs and a Mexican Coke.  She glances towards the back, then shakes her head and tells me that they don't have hot dogs.  They only had breakfast burritos and menudo.  WTF?  Granted, it was early (9:30am), but if you are open for business, how can you NOT HAVE YOUR MOST FAMOUS ITEM available?  They said that the hot dogs wouldn't be ready until about after 10:30am. I wasn't about to sit there for an hour, so I left.  I was unbelievably pissed off and disappointed...its not a quick drive from Surprise, either.  

Anyways.........fast forward a few months later.  I was driving down 51st and was about to pass El Guero Canelo.  I was hungry enough to stop and sample one of their dogs.  I walked in, placed my order for a hot dog with no mayo, paid the lady my money (about that....the dogs are $2.78 and come out to $3.02 after tax.  Why not make them $2.76, so it's an even $3.00.  Who wants to fuck with breaking another dollar, or getting back $.98 cents in change?  Not I says the fly!) and took a seat.  About 2 minutes later, my dog was ready.  Here is how it was.........

Sonoran Hot Dog-  Good, but not great.  The OG location in Tucson is/was better.  My dog came with a bacon wrapped frank, beans, onions, tomatoes, mustard and a jalapeno type sauce.  All of this is stuffed inside a super soft bun.  They use a cheap hot dog which detracts from this being a great dog.  I did really like the bun and the onions (grilled and nice and sweet!).  The beans surprisingly work really well, too.  I may just shoot for a dog with onions, mustard and jalapeno sauce next time though.  While technically this wouldn't then be a ""Sonoran Dog"", I think I would enjoy it a bit more.  I'm usually a plain jane type guy when it comes to my dogs (mustard, onion and sometimes relish).  I ate my dog pretty quick, and was out of there.

Overall, it was A-OK.  I have another/better Sonoran Dog spot in Phoenix already that I would hit up before coming back here, but if I was down in this neighborhood and a Sonoran Dog craving hit, I would come back.  Service was much friendlier this time and the price is fair.  If all these Sonoran dog places could start using a good hot dog (Nathans, Hebrew National etc), they would be much better than they already are!  If I ran the place, Tim's Sonoran Dog stand would definitely use a higher quality dog ;-). Maybe I'll take that idea to Shark Tank and see if Mark Cuban will partner with me to get higher quality dogs in these joints.  A man can dream, right?",2016-05-26 07:03:20

Oh and get this, you would think appetizer is something comes first before the main dish, but ours did not.  It came in the middle of the main dishes.  This is the order we got our food: Rainbow roll, Spider roll, Ika Yaki (grilled squid), Seafood Tempura, another sushi roll which I don't recall what it was and last but not least, unagi don which by the way I didn't know it serves COLD????  
Needless to say, it was a great disappointment.  I am sorry but I would not want to come back and give this another chance.  It's just not even worth another chance at all....not even when at the end the chef gave us four tiny little complementary salmon rolls.",2011-12-19 07:59:13

4) Eager faces and watering mouths as tapas are slowly brought out to their owners

yummm.. makes me drool just reminiscing about the experience and especially my meal! Absolutely everything we ordered had an extra kick or zing that took me by surprise. Every ""normal"" dish offered, or so it was described, had an unexpected twist of flavors.

We ordered Wild Mushrooms On Toast (Panini), Ahi Tuna with Sesame & Soy Drizzle (Skewers), Sashimi Tuna Tacos (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Sticky Veal Short Ribs (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Soul Roll (Sushi: Soul Originals), Goat Cheese Ice Cream and Pistachio Ice Cream (Soul Made Ice Cream). All this for two little girls who, by the way, finished every last bite! In parentheses are the categories of each item. I would recommend any and all of these dishes, but my absolute favorite is the Sticky Veal Short Ribs! These were the most amazing short ribs I have ever had! The meat was so tender and the flavors oh so rich. The meat slid off the bone with ease and every bite was drenched with flavors!  Aside from the amazing short ribs, I have to say that Soul houses the best Pistachio Ice Cream.. IN THE WORLD! The entire meal was absolutely divine. I can't wait to come back!

What I enjoyed was the fact that you get to pick four courses for $44 also known as a prix-fixe menu. Also, the cocktails were very good, especially the one with vodka, lemon soda and an orange.

I started with the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates which only came with three and were very underwhelming. While chocolate and bacon sounds good, it just doesn't taste that great.

Next were the chicken wings, which came with about 10. The meat fell right off the bone which was amazing, but the lime/jalapeno flavor was just not evenly distributed and just didn't mix appropriately.

Luckily, my dinner course was pretty delish. I got the Duck 'n Pumpkin Pasta which was basically ground duck mixed in with a great sweet and spicy sauce with bits of pumpkin in it. I took a risk with this one cause I don't usually eat duck but was pleasantly surprised.

The real treat was the desert. The Caramel Chocolate Pot Au Feu was like heaven in my mouth. Seriously, if you end your meal with this you won't be disappointed.

The girl at the table next to me got sick during her meal, but that's what you get for ordering Steak Tartar. Raw beef and a raw egg never equals a happy stomach if you ask me.

They serve pizza by the slice and true to NY style they are huge thin crust slices that you can fold over to get it in your mouth. If you see someone take a knife and fork to it, smack them. I assume it could only add to their authentic NY experience. THen show them how to eat it properly. Fold nearly in half, insert into mouth.

If you've ever tried the lime Tostito chips with the fake overwhelming lime flavor, that is exactly what my burrito tasted like but more limey and more fake.

The hostesses luckily had square sampling of thin crust pizza to calm the hunger. While waiting we went over to the bar area where I sipped on a moscato.  Cold crisp sweet adult grape juice!

All the plates came out at the same time - as not suggested and waiting so long for the salad that should not have taken 15 minutes-ish. 

The salad is always great because it's reasonably packed with kalamata olives, romaine lettuce, feta cheese, roasted red peppers, red onion rings, pine nuts and honey vinegarette. The pine nuts tasted stale and old. Luckily those dropped to the bottom of the plate. Wings were great. The pasta dish was supposed to be composed of the poblanos pasta diced Roma tomatoes and cream.

We got a complimentary dish with shrimp and mushrooms. It was very tasty. It took quite a long time but our 3 bowls of ramen eventually came out and they looked...meh.

Since it was a Tuesday, and the show has been out for awhile, there were all of 11 people in this very large theatre.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd go here more often.",2011-06-21 22:57:33

I was SO impressed by the amount of outdoor seating and the grounds. The format for ordering was very efficient. Very little wait time for our meals. I'm not a thin crust pizza fan, i generally prefer extra cheesy greasy pizza, but there was definitely a difference in the fresh toppings right down to the pepperoni.

They were amazing about getting me a fairly last minute reservation for 9 people and we ended up with kind of a private room. Our server was really great especially with all the special requests we had going on. We tried the pimento cheese dip and crostini which I actually really liked a lot. I went for the pan fried chicken and for my 3 sides I did the southern green beans, mac and cheese, and creamed corn. So first off, they were out of white meat, it was a bit of a disappointment, but not a deal breaker. The chicken was okay, but not a ton of flavor. There just wasn't any spice to it. The green beans were delicious, and the mac and cheese was seriously work dying for!! I was instantly transported to Sunday potlucks at church. I'm talking true southern mac and cheese, yumm! The corn was decent, but I could have done with double mac and cheese and been happier. I also got a biscuit which was delicious. Normally in a situation like this I'd probably only give 3 stars because the food wasn't super impressive. However there were enough items I liked, the service was fantastic, and the Bordeaux we got was a great choice. I love the purpose of the restaurant as well and that alone is enough for another star. I'd come back to try something else and get a vat of mac and cheese lol.",2017-03-09 20:12:57

The service is friendly, the place is spotless and if you manage to get yourself a seat, you can watch all the neighbourhood four legged friends pass by.

Why is this latte my new favourite?  It's the perfect middle of the road - not weak and not so strong that I feel like I could change the oil in my car with it.  I compare this to a wine tasting...different notes and tones and complexities.  If I was drinking from a clear glass I would be looking for legs on this bad boy.

The donut...I must try them all...but for a start I shared the peanut butter and jelly with my friend.

Place is clean and very well put together. The food is abysmal. I went with a recommendation - Cuban sandwich. No swiss cheese, wasn't griddled, quite dry and entirely flavorless. The coleslaw was among the worst I've ever had. The homemade chips, which the waitress raved over, were cold. A simple heat lamp would make them warm, even if they weren't fresh from the fryer. 

I feel a tinge of remorse for leaving a bad review -- the staff was incredibly friendly.

I ordered the steak frites and my coworker ordered the Salmon served with pimento cheese grits.  I also tacked on a biscuit because. . . why not?

The steak was good.  Not great.  It was cooked to my liking and the demi glace was good but I wish the steak itself had been seasoned more.  The frites were good.  My coworker let me try the pimento cheese grits and those were delicious.  Very rich flavor.  The biscuit was pretty meh.  I expected something to be served with it (butter? jelly?)

Selection is wonderful at this place.  I find the produce to be a good selection, as well as other sections of the store.  And their store brand I find to be of good quality as well.

Located around the Capital, we saw many patrons dining both inside and outside and decided to grab dinner here. Their menu consists of many shareable plates and is good for a nice romantic dinner. We tried tagliolini, a seafood ceviche, scallops, beef tartare, and the bread plate. It was a perfect amount of food for two people. Food comes out slowly, but that's a positive thing if you consider the ""french style"" dining. 

The food was nice and well executed but nothing stood out. The tagliolini was drowning in butter and coupled with the butter soaked bread dish, was a little rich for me. I enjoyed the seafood ceviche but the bread that came with it did not work well and seemed to be just a filler. It also just didn't seem to be too fresh (the avocados were a bit off in it and had a strange taste), but I suppose this is Madison, so I can't set my expectations too high. I also enjoyed their take on beef tartare and that it was not a completely raw plate of beef. 

The scallops were enjoyable and probably my favorite dish there. Well done with good flavors. 

Overall, I enjoyed the ambience and location of the area. The food was well executed but nothing to write home about. Prices were reasonable, but with so many nice New American options in Madison, I might make a circuit and check those out before I come back.",2018-07-15 16:48:57

It was a Wednesday night, not unlike any other night, but I was craving some wings....not just any wings. I wanted some good looking wings, just like the commercials, and wanted to have the opportunity to try some good tasty menu items that are featured on the website.

Off to wild wings in Steele Creek.....This is relatively new, appears clean and fresh from the outside and it features a nice large covered patio area with some tv's with ample seating.  But this mind you is where the good stuff ends, and the adventure begins. 

It took a few minutes for the hostess to locate a table for us, there were 2 clean tables and six ( yes 6 ) dirty tables that were never bussed or cleaned in the main area toward the entrance or front door.  I mention six tables as they were the same six tables that were never cleaned prior to our departure.

The service was slow, the atmosphere or environment could have been nice, but regardless where you are .....if you are sitting next to trash and dirty tables, then you may as well be eating next to a landfill, this place was a dive.  Trash on the floor, filthy tables, and did I mention the dirty tables, Geez, the UFC was on, the football game was on, and all I could see was the trash!

So we ordered drinks and an Appetizer, the hostess was the food runner, and brought the mushrooms after 10 minutes or so.... The wings, well we were going to eat them there, however with all the trash, we chose to have our meals boxed to go since we could not stand the trash.  As I recall, there were no silverware for us to use , and the mushrooms came out in a cardboard type box, so why can't the servers just throw the trash away? 

Will I be back, Don't Think so!

Just thought this location needs a boot in the buttocks, as if management noticed this and allowed this location to look like that, then it won't take long before it will become like the Buffalo, Nearing Extinction.

What looked like copper pipe cut for the napkin rings, small vases with a sprig of mint on each table... definitely no unnecessary frills here! Luckily the surroundings are simplistic because when the dishes are served - look out! Magic, spice and everything nice begins.

We ordered almost everything on the menu (or so it seemed).
So when it comes to starting off the meal, I highly recommend sharing the grilled cheese with pancetta & roasted red pepper tomato soup AND the vegetable chop salad with pumpkin seed brittle and a champagne vinaigrette. Although I won't lie - the creamy grits & spicy andouille sausage and mustard came in as a close second. The server mentioned there were three (count them....3!) different types of sausages in the dish. Fantastic and very unique.

Onto the entrees! We tried four but of the ones we picked it was a close tie between the short ribs and the pork osso buco confit. The pork was interesting because it was served with a butternut squash spaetzle, roasted veggies and a black pepper reduction. Quite the combo!

Looking for some serious winter-ish food?? Don't pass up the chicken n dumplings...just like mom used to make (shhh....only waaaaay better!)

I almost forgot about the cocktails! They run a little on the sweet side so I'd recommend a cocktail to start but then stick with wine. We tried almost all of the cocktails but my fave was Miss Katie's Pimms Cup!

Lastly, let's talk about dessert.
While the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel, housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter and graham cracker was a novel idea - DO NOT PASS UP THE FIG & PECAN PIE.

We were seated at a great table and were instantly welcomed by our waiter.  He was very friendly and helpful, helping us make several selections, and was always attentive but never overbearing. 

We selected a fabulous wine from their list and the half carafe turned out to be the perfect size.  At the conclusion of our meal I also ordered one of their cocktails- the Bridgette Bardot- which was phenomenal.  I was nervous it would be overly sweet but it had a perfect apple flavor, a real apple flavor, not a sickly sweet syrup.  I highly suggest it.

We started with the escargot in pastry puff that was soaked in oil and garlic.  It was one of their specials for that day so I'm not sure if it's always on the menu but if it is, I would highly recommend ordering it.  I ordered the gnocchi for dinner which was absolutely extraordinary.  The gnocchi is made differently from Italian style gnocchi, with no potato but instead pastry puff.  The portion was very generous and the combination with tomatoes, leeks, and goat cheese was perfect.  My husband ordered the slow-cooked lamb shoulder, also a special not on the menu, and couldn't believe how amazing it was.  The lamb literally fell apart with the touch of the fork and was perfectly seasoned and was complimented by the garlic risotto. The waiter informed us that Keller actually pioneered a new method of slow cooking that was so different that he and a few other chefs had to devise the health code regulations that govern the new method because there was no standard for it.  The waiter informed us that they always offer some special slow roasted dish - whether it be meat, vegetable or even fruit for dessert.  I would highly recommend getting whatever dish features this amazing technique.

For dessert we chose the beignets, which are cream filled fried dough pastries that came with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce.  They were the perfect way to finish off the meal.  My husband enjoyed a very good cappuccino and we both enjoyed the plate of mini cookies that they brought to us.  The sommelier also helped my husband choose a cigar from their cigar menu for later in the night.

This was truly a fantastic dining experience.   I am eager to return and try their brunch and I highly recommend it for a relatively inexpensive dinner in Vegas.",2007-09-04 03:38:48

We made reservation ahead of time for a table for 10 for Friday dinner, but it turned out the reservation wasn't needed, because the restaurant was only half filled. Compared to the other Chinese seafood restaurants nearby, Sang Ho isn't as popular.

We really wanted Lobsters, but the 3 dishes party combo was $75 and the Double Lobster dish itself was $44. We ended up picking one dish per person to share, along with the Lobster dish. 

The food came rather quickly, but they messed up our order a few times, such as giving us the wrong dish or completely missing dishes. The meal came with complementary house soup and dessert, much like the other restaurants nearby. I really liked their Sweet Ribs, Deep fried duck with taro, and of course, the Lobsters.

The service was pretty much what you would expect from around here...grumpy middle aged Chinese people, but will respond to you most of the times. I was annoyed of how long it took them to get our bills though because it was during their break time and apparently no one wanted to get up to do their job. Debit and credit is accepted over $20.

Overall, I think the place is decent, not too pricey, as it ended up being $26 after tax and tips for us. Though I think the place is subpar compared to the other Seafood places nearby, both in terms of prices, quantity, and quality",2018-04-22 16:28:08

The initial scent of sweaty gym socks and piss as soon as you walk in only lasts about 5 minutes then, you get used to the smell. To the left, is an area where you can pick out your prize and to the right is a virtual gaming room for those who love PC games. Straight ahead are arcade games, circus games, simulators, Air Hockey, photo booth, etc. To the right and towards the back are private rooms for events and parties. At the very back is the bar/restaurant.

I've been here for a work function and so, we were in a private room. I was pleasantly surprised by the food they served us: chicken marsala, salads, braised beef with veggies, and funnel cakes. They also had more items on the menu. I was expecting pizza, fries, nachos, hotdogs and other junk. We had 2-hour game cards - those don't work on games that could instantly win you a prize (like those machines with claws that grab a toy) and the photobooth. Your time starts dwindling down as soon as you use it.

I felt the need to re-live my youth and play games that I loved as a kid: Street Fighter (hadouken! Tiger uppercut! Sonic boom! Face bite! Helicopter kick!), Air Hockey, DDR and of course, Super Shot - that basketball shooting game. I would spend hours playing Super Shot...that has not changed the few times I've been to Gameworks. I get so into it like you don't even know. Sweat, focus, hand-eye coordination and a little tippy toe so i could see where the ball is going. I got hit on the head with a loose basketball by the kid 2 spaces away from me and I'm still going. I'd wake up the next day with my shoulders and calves feeling sore - but oh my gosh, it's so fun! I got people watching me when I play - I'm either such a badass at playing or there isn't a free hoop to shoot.

I tried all of the other games when I got tired. I got challenged to play Air Hockey by my sister and a few other people - I owned every single one of them.

* complimentary pickled cucumber ($4) - okay

* 2 complimentary wood ears & tofu skins ($5) - really good tofu skins

* 1 five spiced eggplant ($5) - eggplant was cooked well but the spicy sauce did nothing for me

* 5 pork soup dumplings ($9) - not the best but probably as good as you can get in Pittsburgh, the skin was nice and delicate - a little too delicate at times as it was hard to get out of the steamer without losing the soup, the filling could be more tender though

* 2 pork & crab meat soup dumplings ($11) - not worth ordering the crab, just stick to plain 

* 1 shrimp & loofah soup dumplings ($12) - interesting but again not as good as the plain pork, couldn't really taste the loofah

* 2 vegetable dumplings ($9) - really great filling, probably my favorite dumpling

* 2 rolled onion pancakes w/ sliced beef ($8) - okay, skip this

* 4 pan fried green onion pancake ($6) - meh, skip this

* 4 taiwanese style pork belly sliders($6) - everyone raves about this - including my family - but I didn't get it, the pork belly wasn't very tender though the sliders are huge - more like hamburger size

* 2 noodles with minced pork sauce (zha zhang mian $7) - my favorite dish of the evening but I would expect as much from a restaurants that touts their hand pulled noodles - noodles were very chewy tasty and excellent

* 1 Taiwanese style sesame cold noodles ($6) - didn't like the noodles in this as much

* 2 sweet bean paste crispy pancakes ($7) - awesome, I ate a whole plate

* complimentary creamy crispy mini bun ($4) - my family liked this but it just wasn't to my taste

My picks if I were to come back are in ranked order 1) noodles with minced pork sauce (dry noodles), 2) sweet bean paste crispy pancakes (dessert), 3) vegetable dumplings, 4) pork soup dumplings. 4 stars for these dishes. Skip everything else.

Came in for lunch on a Friday without prior reservation. We had intended to go to a different indian buffet but they were closed for renovations. It is possible that it being temporarily offline caused this place to get a lot more customers.

There's a washroom upstairs, outside of the restaurant itself. The washroom itself is pretty nice, with an excellent hand-dryer.

When we arrived, there was a line waiting at the door. Maybe three or four groups of people in front of us. We looked in to get their attention and noticed a number of empty tables, but we were informed that they have been reserved already. Well, given that Friday lunches tend to be quite busy, probably should've called in.

After 15 mins, a table cleared up and we got seated. Now, this was when we realized there was a SECOND entrance on the other side of the restaurant, and there was also a line-up there. Basically, this place has two entrances, and the staff are just walking back and forth to greet people. Weird.

The seating plan is quite cramped, and expect to weave around the room to get to your seat, especially if it's really busy there's a number of bottle necks. There are a number of tables placed really close to the food area, which isn't going to be particularly comfortable for those sitting there, and those trying to get food.
Worse, for some reason, they decided to place the hot foods next to where those tables are, rather than off to the side. The salad bar's over at the side and no one really goes there.

Floors were also sticky, but I guess it's reasonable since it's busy and they don't really have time to clean up any accidents. Service staff only came around like twice during the 30 mins we were there, but again, they're really busy and there was this huge company lunch that seemed to be getting more attention.

In terms of food selection, I think there's less than the other indian buffets in the area. I did enjoy the taste and quality of the food however, so if they carry your favourite dishes, then quality over quantity right? Food re-fills don't come too fast so if it's busy, you may end up having to wait for the next batch.",2017-01-20 20:41:53

I brought friends of mine to this restaurant and most recently a friend of mine that is a chef. - He said that this is the best AYCE sushi place he's ever been to, and I second his word, it is definitely amazing.

Like I said in my first review of this place, it's designed nice and fits nicely with the environment. They attend to you quickly and service is very quick even on a busy day. They're very friendly, even when in a bad mood; customer service is a huge deal to the manager.

The sushi rolls are still amazing, green dragon, salmon rolls. I didn't like the sano roll though, it tasted weird and the crab was not authentic but what can you expect for such a deal?

The salmon sashimi is cut so perfectly and so fresh. AMAZING.

The food has continued to impress and I will continue going there. The only thing I've spotted that has been different is the amount of wasabi they give now as opposed to before. They used to give a huge amount of wasabi but now limit it - That's totally understandable though because they wouldn't want it to go to waste.

Along with the amazing food, they still have a great incentive to go there. - 15% off dinner, 10% off lunch - If you pay with cash.

I wanted to grab something fast and easy and thought, Hmmmmm, Carl's Jr.? Why not, what could go wrong? There were already several vehicles in line and one pulled up quickly behind me. Once I arrived at the intercom to order, the woman at the drive thru explained that she could not hear me, so I spoke louder, she explained that she still could not here, after the 3rd time of her telling me she could not here me she tells me that I have to go into the restaurant to order. After about 10 minutes of sitting I was able to get to the window and tried to order there, but again she explained she could not here me face to face and I have to still go inside. 

Once inside, I asked Pedro how many pieces came with the chicken tenders, he looked at me confused, I asked how many chicken tenders can I order, he said 20 was the highest amount. He explained he did not understand the question, I then had to explain that I was not wearing my glasses or my contacts and wanted to know the amounts they offered, he said all the pieces are about the same size. I had to explain, some places come with a 3 pc, 6 pc, 9 pc, etc, finally he got it. I placed my order, asked what type of fries I can order, regular, curly, waffle? He took another 5 minutes for me to explain which option of fries were, finally he says OH we have waffle styled fries, I asked what dipping sauce choices do I and he points across the way and says they are there, I again explained that I did not have my glasses on (they were in the car) and he rolls his eyes and rambles what the choices were.

I enjoyed the different meats and thought they were decent quality and the selection was solid with the options of Ribeye, chicken, shrimp, and pork belly.  All of it fresh but as you know you have to cook it yourself .  Overall a good experience but a little pricey for what you actually get and I probably will go back at some point but not for a while.  I also felt frustrated with the seasonings on the meat and a lot of times was missing out because I lack the experience with which Korean spices I like the best.  This issue left much of the meat sort of bland and forgettable which is a shame.

Left it there went back picked it up 3 hours later, paid the 85.00 and left. That was late in the evening so in the morning I took my daughter to school, happy she has a new working phone, life is great. We pick her up from school....phone dead. what.  Yes.  I swear...i need to go there AGAIN!!!! I am going to flip my lid! I do not have timed to do this. So i make appointment and off we go AGAIN! By this point I am irritated, tired, mad, just want a stupid working phone. 
     It was our lucky day! We got ""TUCKER"" as our service rep.  He took one look and asked me a couple of questions and immediately said....""I will make this right- DO NOT WORRY"" I could have went bat shit crazy (but I said OK)  Tucker ran a few tests, asked me a couple more questions and said ""I will get you a new phone"". I had already been told the day before it would 249 to replace if there was water damage (so i was expecting to buy a 249 phone). I of course say ""Oh a refurbished phone(because I am fine with that as long as it works!)  Tucker said ""NO- we do not give out used phones ever!"" I was like ""OH..ok..im fine with that too!""  Tucker was juggling 3 customers and was very professional and personable.  He asked me if anyone offered a phone to us yesterday, i said no.  He had his manager bring a new iphone out and power it up and transfer all of her data onto it!!! MY EYES WERE AS BIG AS SAUCERS!! Then he pulled up my invoice from the night before and had the manager refund me my 85.00.  He indicated in the 6 years he worked there he never had seen this happen and just knew he needed to make the customer happy from the start!  I was simply shocked! I have been left completely in shock!  I think I will get the whole family Iphones now! I have been left IMPRESSED!  I highly recommend having ""Tucker"" help you...he is great with people and extremely efficient!

With that said, it is a bit different for the neophyte to the characteristics of the Vietnamese kitchen. It has different smalls, suttle tastes and sometimes present consistencies that the Western eater aren't ready for. 

But this shouldn't discourage the adventurer. The food is good, and it isn't that hard to stay on a meat free path. The service have room to improve, but I shouldn't venture there.. I seem to be a privately owned business, so I should let them run this place as they see fit. But even so, I wasn't blown away - however, I will return and give this place a second chance.

The service isn't quite as shining. Water glasses sit empty, and we haven't seen our fave waitress who knows what we like right down to our extra bowls for curry. She truly makes the food taste better with her attentiveness, smile and amazing memory. The food has also suffered from a little inconsistency, probably growing pains from opening an additional location. One of the last curries I ordered was over spiced. The heat overwhelmed the flavors.

Some of the hole in the wall charm is wearing off. I hope they have plans to make the place a bit spiffier like their sister location. And, there is a charge for brown rice now, which isn't a big deal really. I just wanted to update that from my first review.

Strippers can have all my money. It's been this way forever. This is why I don't go to strip clubs often. 
I drain my bank account, even if it's the last $10 I have, to spend. I could be saving money for a heart operation and if you take me in a strip club, that's it. Over.

second of all , my attraction to strippers is similiar to the average dirty old man in America 
I like them blonde, skinny, small waists with huge fake tits 

for some reason we couldn't get the stripper I wanted to come over, she was fake blonde hair, fake big tits, fake face.
i asked for her twice and even our waitress asked her to come over, but she kept saying she was too busy with her friends and would come over later

I said ""that's it, we don't even need to see anyone else after her, she is IT"" 
If I wasnt dragged out of there, I would still be getting lap dances from her right now

She almost made me a LESBO

It was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.

The burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.  Seriously.  Man, that shit was spicy.  I kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me.

I had to laugh when I opened up my to-go back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I didn't get ANY salsa, but when I took a look they gave me soooo much.  I made a small tower beside my meal, like a Stonehenge of heat.

Three stars:  Good.  Not great.  Weird bathroom.  Unfriendly lady.  Good food.  Too expensive.",2010-06-11 21:37:29

I ordered the 6 piece nuggets, Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger (plain), and had to try their new BBQ Pork Cheese Fries. You have a choice of sweet, smoky, or spicy sauce. I decided to try the sweet. Their Coca Cola Freestyle machines were out of a lot of flavors. Tables were dirty and needed to be wiped down. When the food came out, I was disappointed to see onions on the pork fries. I didn't realize it came with onions, so we had to scoop them off. Of course you can never get them all... There wasn't a lot of BBQ pork on the fries. The flavor was nothing special. I had a bite of my boyfriend's pork sandwich with the smoky sauce and I liked that sauce better. The sandwich was a whole lot more bread than pork though. Kinda sad really. My burger was simple but tasted good with the bacon. The nuggets were fine (actually got 7) but didn't really do it for me tonight. Should've gone for the spicy nuggets.

My issue with Cantina Laredo is their ingredients - everything in our meal came out of a can or a freezer bag which resulted in really stale food. I go out to eat to get food I can't make as well as home, but I'll settle for food that's as good as I make at home...Cantina Laredo couldn't even meet that. The dish concepts really sounded so good, if only they used fresh and good ingredients. We had:

- Chili con queso: I was expecting a queso fundido like dip but instead it was canned nacho cheese with a can of rotel diced tomato/chillis. This would be fine if it was HH & bar food & priced at something around $3...not appropriate to charge $8 for this crap. It really was bad canned nacho cheese.
- Spinach Enchiladas: The spinach filling very clearly tasted like frozen spinach (without any fresh garlic or other flavors to dress it up) and the green bean vegetables on the side were very clearly frozen green beans (awful). The roasted poblano cream sauce just tasted like sour cream without any chili flavor.
- Chicken Enchiladas: My boyfriend got this dish & enjoyed his enchiladas. However he had the same issue with the green beans, and the rice tasted like boxed rice from the grocery store (which isn't terrible but I would expect an upscale restaurant to do better).
- Mango Margarita: Yummy. Easily the tastiest thing I had all night.

First off rotisserie chicken should be really juicy, but it wasn't. They give a garlic  spread that is made with sour cream I think but they give a really small amount of it. They need to give a whole lot more since they chicken was a little bland other than the skin. 

I was hoping that this place made rotisserie chicken like Zankuo chicken in LA but no luck there. It wasn't even as good as my rotisserie from my Ronco showtime oven. 

I was full but I was un-satisfied since it was missing flavor.",2010-12-27 02:38:13

It's a pretty small, clean, no frills establishment. Almost feels like ordering at a food court counter. They have a paper menu but also have everything written above the cash counter, you order, go back to your seat and return to take your food on plastic trays! The meat combinations are pretty extensive; my eyes watered staring at the back lit board trying to figure out what to order. I finally went with the lamb kabobs, bread and salad. My friend ordered the fish and rice. It's not as cheap as you'd think it would be, given the whole set-up.

We could smell them cook our food, the spices they use are flavorful and very fragrant! I loved the meat: juicy, tender and flavorful and the bread was amazing: warm, crisp and with the right amount of sesame! My friends salmon was really, really good: crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and so flavorful. You could feel the excess spices hit your tongue as you bit into the fish! The rice was super delicious as well. The garden salad was just meh in comparison and felt like an after thought. 

We were plenty full and satisfied after our trip, though a bit smelly on the subway ride back home. I bet that the other riders probably thought,  ""Damn, that smells delicious!""

The food strictly is 4 star worthy, rest of the restaurant space is very sterile, no-frills 2-3 stars worthy. Much better for take out than for a dine-in experience.",2012-04-20 19:27:06

Next time I'll ask to cut a little more because of my ingrown skin (skin not nail, crazy I know). Believe it or not, the massage chairs were uncomfortable for me.

Anyone else have this problem? I've never experienced this, maybe I did something wrong with my chair I have no idea. The male nail tech was friendly and gentle.

I came home and put a clear coat on. The weird thing though.... whatever clear coat they use is not shiny at all, it almost made my nails feel like they had a matte look to them. No clue, but I put a clear coat on them and they look fabulous now. Overall, the place is clean, elegant, vibrant, and the workers are all chatty (in English) and laughing, having a good time. Love it! Water bottles are offered as well. So my main couple of disappointments is their pedicure chairs aren't comfortable, although high tech and new.

The hotel reminds me of Vdara. Super swanky, new, and less smokey due to the lack of casinos. It's connected to Miracle Mile and Planet Hollywood, so staples such as Earl's and Fat Tuesdays are only a stumble away.

The room was spacious with us managing to fit nearly 15 people in some fashion. I particularly enjoyed the hot tub inside the bedroom. It can fit 3-4 folks for a good ol pool party inside your very own space. The large kitchen was an added treat and really allowed us to pre-game properly before heading out.

My only real gripe with the room was the bathroom setup. The glass door for the toilet (while shading out the actual toilet seat) was a bit awkward. You saw feet every time somebody was present.

Security was interesting since you were required to actually insert your room key with the man downstairs. Not a huge issue, but can be awkward if you are attempting to have a lot of people enter at once. Just smile and walk with confidence.

The pool was probably the best part of our stay. As a group, we ended up reserving a cabana. The catch? You just needed to spend $200 in food and drinks, and the shade was yours. Our spot was directly in front of the hot tub and next to the showers and toilets. What more could you ask for? With a large group, it was a steal.

Elara was a fantastic experience and I would recommend it for anyone wishing to stay in a comfortable, clean, and convenient location. The three Cs work! For the price we paid, we couldn't have gotten a better deal... maybe an upgrade in the future.",2016-06-29 14:31:46

54Xo0GWxSe1S0kpTAWBCtw,Nr2uHirba5WNcG0vOXoVDA,cVlW0omVTRaVJqnT-OBBsQ,4,1,1,1,"I've been both mayor and duchess of Piola simultaneously, so I guess it's high time I wrote a review. Since the Piola chain opened up a restaurant in Toronto, and having been introduced to it by one Ashleigh G., I've been making it a pretty regular pitstop for dinner night out with the family.

The Italian side of my family is from Treviso, where Piola originated, so it seems like a natural pairing that we eat here. We've had nothing but excellent service and good food since coming here. I can even bring my 92 year old great aunt who is generally very fussy, as all old Italian people are, without worry. There are no steps to get in and out of the place, which is great and she loves the food and wine. She even flirts with the male servers! Her only complaint is the music. Admittedly, they did have a Justin Bieber remix on rotation for awhile but will also plays some great Motown, Jackson, Orbison, and even Arcade Fire.

Tonight we enjoyed 3 bottles of wine all on special for 1/2 price. It's not the holidays unless you get liquored up with your relatives over a big meal, right? 

I'm a fan of their gnocchi, which they tell me has no egg in it (honestly, I find that quite baffling, since traditional recipes call for egg) but I'm not complaining, since an egg-less gnocchi means it's vegan when paired with tomato sauce. 

Other plates that can be enjoyed vegan are the Insalata Ricca that comes with romaine lettuce, beets, beans and olives. I also enjoy the Moderna pizza, which is arugula and tomato or the Ortomisto, a grilled veggie pizza, which can be made vegan by omitting the cheese.

The pizza crust almost, almost rivals Libretto and really, I'm happier to come here rather than put up with the wait and the noise level at Libretto with my family in tow. We've been there and done that, and it's way too taxing.

Did I mention how great the service is? It's worth saying again. The manager has always been very attentive and if there has ever been even the slightest mistake (once my pizza was served only luke warm) we have been compensated and then some. Good service is a big part of why we keep returning for family dinners. We've also had a great server who is .. british, australia? One of those, but she is excellent, has a great cheery personality that is contagious and the bartender/server time who had his mo'stache in full bloom tonight was also wonderful as well.

The menu is on the dairy-heavy side but it is easy for a lacto vegetarian to navigate and they are able to make a lot of dishes vegan by request. It's also gluten-heavy, and I would not recommend it if you're gluten intolerant or just phobic because there's scant choice beyond appetizers.

In the summer there's a nice little patio on the sidewalk and they have TVs for watching euro soccer games at the bar inside and even had one set up outdoors during the world cup. 

I'm going to keep coming back to Piola and enjoy all the best foods that start with 'p'; pizza. pasta, and prosecco! 

And yes, they do a Lucky Gnocchi night EACH (not every, because that implies more than one) 29th of the month. We always note this grammatical error in their marketing. It is a good deal for vegetarians and omnivores alike (but not the vegan or the gluten-free.) 14.99 buys you AYCE gnocchi in a variety of sauces.",2012-11-29 05:57:31

While they were getting our table ready, a few of us sat at the bar and had a drink. I decided to ask the bartender for one of his personal specialties. He ended up giving me something he calls the Naughty Irishman. I didn't really watch him make it, but it looked like it was primarily Jameson and Bailey's with crushed ice. I give him props for hand crushing the ice. The drink was pretty good, but it came with the typical Vegas price tag of about $13.

Once seated, we did the AYCE tapas thing for $19.99 per person. Note that you technically need a Hard Rock player's card to get that price; otherwise, it's $23.99. Based on the prices of each item, I got my money's worth. On the other hand, if I disregard how much they list each item, I still probably got my money's worth. I'd say their tapas are a mixed bag. Most of them were decent to very good. Nothing was amazing. If I do this again, I have a few items I would skip.

The Good
* Poona Tuna - I started off with this because someone mentioned it on Yelp. The cherry limeade was an interesting sauce and the tuna was maybe slightly overcooked, but I enjoyed the dish.
* Jack & Coke - One of the better items. Very tasty.
* Lettuce Cups - Shrimp was slightly overcooked, but that's just being picky. This was quite tasty.
* Sea Bass - I only tried some of this from someone else's order. It was pretty good, but not my favorite.
* Tuna Sashimi - It's hard to mess up ahi tuna. This was simple and tasty.
* Surf & Turf - The vanilla butter added a strange flavor to the mix, but pretty good overall.
* Grilled PB&J - I found it a little strange that the jelly was on the side i.e. you had to add it yourself, but it was still good. Honestly, I prefer the Fried PB&J we had at the Elite event at Republic, but come on. It's Grilled PB&J!

The Bad
* Chicken & Waffles - Disappointing. The chicken was not tasty at all. I didn't like the breading and (once again) it was overcooked. The waffle fries were pretty good though.
* Octapussy - I don't like the tapioca batter that they use. Skip.

The Ugly
* Tater Tots - It might be the truffle oil, but these smelled and tasted like gasoline. They were nauseous.

Come to find out yes they do so we ordered that and some sweet and sour chicken. When we got our order the Tom Yum soup did not look like what we normally order this one was full of noodles and had no mushrooms but we tried it anyway took a couple bites and that was enough for us yuck. Next was the sweet and sour chicken yuck fried way to long and the chicken was dry. My fried rice was suppose to come out with my chicken but they forgot to make it so I had to eat my chicken and wait for the rice to come out like it was my dessert. When the cook saw the waiter throwing away a whole bowl of soup she was curious why so she asked us. We told her that Tom Yum soup we are use to is not full of noodles come to find out the waiter ordered us the wrong dish!! She made us a new batch of soup to take home I have not tried it yet so we will see. I wish they would not have family helping out that does not know anything about Thai food.

We sat outside, near the Venezia Tower pool and garden (which is also lovely) on a beautiful morning.  It was my mom's birthday brunch so everyone ordered what they wanted, we ordered a few extra things, three of us had cocktails, and I still thought the overall cost was very reasonable, considering what we all had.

My stepdad had the Moules au Safron, which was clearly the showstopper dish amongst all of them at the table.  It was beautifully presented in this really cool pot with a dipping section, and they were tender and flavorful and overall fabulous.  There were a ton of them and he cleaned them out (we all chipped in a bit).

My friend and I both had the omelet of the day which was broccoli rabe and cheddar.  It was delicious.  It also came with a giant stack of super crispy and very tasty bacon and brioche.  Yum.

Mom had the quiche of the day, which was spinach.  It was very good, too, but didn't come with anything on the side.

My only real complaint is that the beignets we ordered were not light and puffed up beignets but really were like a plate of mini-donuts.  They tasted good and came with strawberry sauce and Nutella, but it was just not what I was expecting.

Our drinks were also very good - coffee, bloody marys, mimosas - and the service was excellent, although we did end up waiting a bit to get our check.

So, firstly, the taste of the food is decent. It's not incredibly yummy, but it's also not terrible either. I had the mini bowl of chicken and vegetables and my friend got the beef and chicken with brown rice.

While the whole concept of Flame Broiler is that it serves healthy food, I would say that it's not really healthy since the meats are doused in salty sauce. There are several different kinds of sauces that you can put on your meal. The Magic Sauce is like a soy sauce/teriyaki sauce blend.

- poor portions that contained 50% fat and bone in the meal
- small drink for a high price 
- long wait time for our dinner which arrived in stages and was not hot
- a policy not to do separate bills
- an automatic addition of 18% for a group
- bland disappointing dishes
- Surprises on the bill (nickel and diming over what comes with your meal and what is extra)

The Margarita on various pages I previously saw was in a margarita glass and looked great. What I actually got was small and disappointing. Not even in a proper glass. $12 for a tiny  drink. I asked the waiter for a proper glass and to his credit, he corrected it but it is disappointing it was necessary to do so. The portion was pretty small compared to other Margaritas I have had.

The beans and rice were not served on our main plate as pictured in other reviews. They arrived on small plates with tiny portions and they were cold. Not appetizing or inspiring. I could have gotten better out of a tin from the grocery store. 

My main was Res En Salsa Verde (Braised Beef) $15. It looks NOTHING like what other reviewer's pictures have been. Luke warm, full of fat and bone. Bland. The server asked how our meals were and I let him know it was bland and fatty. He just said sorry and that it was supposed to be like that. What is the point of asking if you don't take corrective action?

Others ordered the Barbacoa (Lamb) $18 and the Shrimp $?. The Shrimp got a good review. The Barbacoa was okay but not spicy. Unfortunately, an order of guacamole was ordered $9. Small portions and bland. Overall it was felt we could have done better at a fast food burrito place. Wow. That doesn't say much to me. What happened to all the good experiences I read about and some saying it was like home cooking they remember in Mexico? This was not my experience. 

I might have given a slightly higher review but then came the bill. The server indicated they don't split the bill and then agreed to split it among the couples at the table. That turned out badly. People who did not drink and had a small order were given $80 bills and those who did drink and ordered appetizers got the lowest. He claimed all the bills were split evenly but they weren't so we asked for one bill and worked to figure out what we each owed ourselves. That took a long time and ruined the meal. 

We also discovered extra charges for the tortillas even through we had a large table and there was only enough for six of us. He earlier indicated that each meal would come with the tortillas. There were 4 containers and 8 people so seems to me someone didn't get theirs. We had to share and then get charged for extra when we never got what we already paid for. I noticed this occurred in another review and I can confirm this happened again to us. 

Sadly, I cannot recommend this place in good conscience. The interior is nice and the staff are generally friendly. I really wish I could have given a better review. 

Now I await my stomach ache from cold fatty food to settle down.

About those chips and salsa.  First basket of chips was cold, second was warm.  Didn't really matter.  There was nothing special about them or the salsa.  The salsa was good, but too sweet for me, and it could use a little more heat.  Overall, average.

The menu was interesting and shows a lot of promise.  For one thing, forget only standard beans and rice for sides.  Options include both black beans and refried beans, an Anaheim chile stuffed with sweet potato, corn pudding, green chile rice, and an open-faced tamale with wild rice.  The refried beans had good flavor, but I wasn't a fan of the texture.  I like whole beans and I like mashed beans, but these were more like a combination.  My husband liked them though.  The black beans were disappointingly bland for both of us.  The stuffed chile was good, but the sweet potatoes were...well, sweet, very sweet.  I really liked this dish, but would have liked to see more done with the potatoes.  A little more spice, a little smokiness to balance out the sweet.  The open-faced tamale was basically masa topped with a creamy wild rice.  I loved this dish with the exception of the masa which was way too hard.  I'm not a tamale-making expert, so not sure if this was a result of the preparation or over-cooking, but the end result was completely the opposite of what it should be.  I almost needed a knife to cut through it.  Would love to see a little more work on that.

As for entrees, we went with pretty basic stuff...carnitas burrito and green chile burrito.  First, the tortillas were a disaster.  I didn't expect the best, but these ladies should know the importance of the carb.  I'm the one who gets tired of the filling, pulls it all out, and eats the tortilla.  I tried that, but it had the consistency of cardboard.  Please, please, please find another supplier.  Both burritos had shredded meat, which I thought a little strange, especially with the carnitas.  The carnitas wasn't bad, but it was dry, and barely warm, not even warm enough to melt the  cheese inside.  The green chile was also borderline cold which I didn't get considering it's supposedly simmered for hours.  I liked this better than the carnitas, but it, too, was missing something.  I actually prefer mild dishes, but even I thought they could turn up the heat a notch.

Overall, I think there's a lot of potential here with a little work on the dishes.  Certainly an A-OK experience just out the gate.  I might also suggest they consider a cocktail menu, if they haven't already.  I was hoping for a margarita with agave nectar & lime juice, but couldn't get any useful info from the server beyond they have a ""house"" margarita and a cucumber margarita. But again, this was only night two, so I'll return in a few weeks and see how they're coming along.  Good luck!",2011-10-19 19:28:59

I realize that they have only recently opened, so they may have a few kinks to work out.  We found the host staff in need of more training.  We asked for a booth and were advised of a 15 minute wait.  When our buzzer went off, we were led to a table.  When we reminded then that we had requested a booth, our host grumbled and went back to the host desk to sort this problem out.  We had to wait a couple more minutes for a booth.  Funny.

Our server was a totally different story.  Nicholas is amazing.  He took time to explain the menu and offered his opinion on different entrees.  Also, he made sure my iced tea glass was always full and even voluntarily brought out more ice when he noticed that mine was disappearing.  Very attentive.    

I opted for the Kung Pao Spaghetti with shrimp.  I loved the heat of the chilies.  Very good.  My bf got an Italian deli sandwich on herb-onion Focaccia.  The bread is made using their pizza dough and is so yummy.  The sandwich consisted of capicola ham, salami and pepperoni Mozzarella and Fontina cheeses, basil and shredded lettuce tossed with our herb-mustard Parmesan vinaigrette.  The combination of the basil and dressing was so very good.  He also got the asparagus soup.  So good.

We decided to try the butter cake for dessert.  It was served warm with a scoop of Häagen-Dazs.  It's a really yummy treat.  We can't wait to go back.",2010-11-16 02:57:11

The first time I went I had a completely forgettable experience with their thai noodle bowl. I had legitimately forgotten this restaurant existed until the first crisp morning of fall I had a sudden craving for spaghetti and meatballs. I frantically search google maps for a nearby restaurant that could provide me with this and allow me to get back to my office quickly. I thought Noodles & Company was my solution.

I went at 11:00am and I was the only customer almost the entire visit. I quickly ordered my spaghetti and meatballs before I settled in to wait. I watched as a worker finally started to assemble my to go bag when the most bizarre thing happened. Instead of grabbing my spaghetti which was sitting on the counter, the only item left to complete my order, he stopped and went to greet the second customer of the day. I sat and watched the whole time he walked her through the menu and took her order while none of the other staff took a second to finish my bag. I honestly considered jumping past the counter to just grab my food and go. Wildly inefficient but he did apologize when he finally finished my bag. 

The real problem is that when I got back to my desk my meatballs were heartbreakingly bland. There wasn't enough sauce for the spaghetti. The side salad was ridiculously small, even for a side.

The reason this place deserves a review is because the service is so good. This is corny, but I always leave this restaurant feeling great because everyone there is so nice. Unless these were just random letters written on my receipt, the employee in charge of my order yesterday was named Pat. Without exception, I've received super friendly experience from every employee I've interacted with there. 

Food-wise, I've honestly never understood the craze and could not tell you a Five Guys burger tastes that much better than any other burger I've eaten. The patty is maybe juicier than a Big Mac but now I'm just looking for differences that I didn't immediately notice when eating. 

They are filling though. I eat a lot and I've resorted to getting the Little Burgers now. I like how they have grilled mushrooms and grilled onions as free topping options. I've tried the regular burgers and the burgers with bacon and I don't really feel like the bacon adds anything. 

I also usually get a regular size cajun fries, which is always too much but I never learn my lesson. A Little Burger and a Little fries would be enough, especially because they fill the fries container and then scoop another container full into the bag. They're nothing special, but they taste good and sometimes I just crave the cajun flavouring because I'm not familiar with any other place in Markham that does that with their fries.

There are also sides available, such as chicken wings, gyoza (fried dumplings), gyu don (beef on rice), and zangi (fried chicken bits). Typically the prices are between $4.50-$5.50.

Anyway, I'll get off my high horse...here is what we tried:

-Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted fresh...both salsas they brought out were very flavorful. One of them which I believe was the roasted salsa was basically just a chunky mash up of roasted peppers and onions and was spicy heaven in a cup.

-Carne Asada Tacos - Wow. Seriously...MY GOD. This is probably the best carne asada I've ever had. Tender, flavorful, glorious toppings...served on a soft and fluffy flour tortilla...foodgasm. 

-Barbacoa Tacos - Melt in your mouth good...just like the carne asada taco's I pretty much didn't know what to say after biting into it, it left me speechless.

-Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada - They used three different types of cheeses...that combined with the tasty tortilla and flavorful carne asada made this yet another winner. 

God was cruel to me and made me allergic to avocado...so I didn't get to try the guacamole, but Katrina thought it was great.

Another thing that was odd was they didnt even offer gyros on their menu...wtf!? The women working there were ok but when we got up to leave they didnt say goodbye or thanks for coming in...nada nothing zip. They were just hanging out and chatting. The only plus was that the place is very clean and neat and we didnt have to wait becuase we were the only ones there. Also the rice and salad that come with the Shawarma meals is bland like cardboard. Very little rice and no dressing for the salad. Other Mediterranean restaurants really hook you up with the rice but not this place. Barely a serving of rice actually. So in summation if your looking for real Shawarma stay away from this place. Im sure there's much better out there.",2012-10-20 15:40:15

First off the place is beautiful. But don't feel the stressful need to dress up as there were a lot of people in jeans and shorts!

Appetizers: Fried calamari was FANTASTIC!!!! the little pit of the Poke i tried was very good as well.  I wasn't too fond of the crab cakes but everyone else seemed to love them.

Dinner:  First off... it took almost 45 min for our food to arrive at the table...
A majority of us had the bison steak.  It was good... but wasn't the best bison i have had. a little disappointed with that.  took a little piece of someones fried chicken and OH MY GOODNESS was it good!

Side dishes:  I personally liked the au gratin potatoes the best! very good.  everyone else loved the creamed corn... it was good but i'm normally not a fan of it in the first place.  the mac and cheese was good... nothing to rant over.  mashed potatoes were very good.... but i like the au gratin better!  the asparagus was under cooked and hard.  was very bland as well and just wasn't worth the $12 or whatever overpriced amount it was.

As our large group walked in, we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated at an accommodating table in the back. I noticed how homey the atmosphere was with the low lightening, the open kitchen and the wooden and brick architecture. Although the restaurant is situated in a random strip mall in Arcadia, you would never know once you get situated inside. 

We started with cocktails and I went for the Palmaire. Tasty!! It had pomegranate infused vodka/juice of some sorts and the soda added a perfect blend to it. 

So now moving on to the food. 

Order everything on the menu, or as much as you can handle for the size of your group because everything I tasted was delicious. The enchiladas have a zing to them, the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness, the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more. 

Now that I was nearly stuffed from the appetizers alone, I moved to the entree. Although I was full and could have (should have) gone with a lighter option, I heard such amazing things about the short ribs that I had to give it a go. Yes, it was worth every bite and more. The shorts ribs were so tender, the meat fell into my fork and the potatoes and green beans were the perfect compliment. 

To end the meal marathon, the group tasted all the desserts on the menu. Yes all of them. Each one was good in its own way, but my favorite was the chocolate souffle cake. What can I say, I'm a chocoholic. 

In summary, this is a great dining option for dinner with your sweetie or with a huge group. You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphere.

Let me also might add...they are only open for dinner and get there early because there will be a wait.",2011-01-27 15:56:05

We had the breads and spreads. My friend ate about a pound of butter! I loved the house made crispy wafers served with it. 

Dinner was port chop for him, cooked perfectly with just a touch of pink and nicely presented. I did the animal frites, made it about 1/4 way through and gave up that battle.

The band was great and the atmosphere was warm and intimate (different from last time I came, which was for an event and the place was packed!). Seating is a bit limited though, so I would advise coming early (like ~10pm when the band is just starting). Currently, they have live music every Friday and Saturday night. The owner, Shawn, said that he's planning for live music 4 nights/week come summertime. On the other nights, they're spinning vinyl and he said you can bring your own and they'll be happy to play it. 

Other notes:
- I tried the Bette Davis, and had a sip of my DC's Bitches Brew. However, the Spanish Fly is still my fave. 
- TV screen behind the bar plays films on mute. On this night, it was ""Chico and Rita"" by Fernando Trueba. 
- The place is pretty dark at night. They give you a mini flashlight to help you read the menu. Cute. 
- Went to check out the back patio. Looks like it'll be a great spot when the weather warms up. You can still hear the music but it's quieter and a nice place to chill.

the staff is really friendly, from when i sat down they were offering cheese balls and corn bread. also they came around to fill our water and make sure we're ok.

we didn't want to eat everything after a while, so when we were refusing the meat they brought us, they were really nice to ask us what we wanted and then soon enough brought it out.

overall, i'd say the chicken was really good. the ribs had good sauce and fell off bone. the steak, only some were good. i liked the top sirlion, chimichurri steak, garlic sirlon, bacon wrapped filet mignon. overall the steak were quite good.

the pineapple is really good, they must put lots of sugar on it cause pineapple can't be that sweet.

but the BEST, was the corn bread, especially right out of the oven. i'd eat that all night it it was worth the $38.99 for dinner.

the salad bar has good variety but i did not bother eating too much from it except to get the necessary veggies in a salad.

i'd say it's quite expensive, i'd rather just go get a nice steak at a steak house.

Their normal entrees of Thai staples like fried rice, pad thai, and pad see ew were pretty decently priced. For the price, the portions weren't too bad at all. For the taste and the service, it's a little bit iffy.

When I received my order of pad thai, the thing I noticed was a good third of my plate was occupied by bean sprouts and the rest of noodles. They have this illusion that you got a lot of food, when all you got was an average amount. I did not really like how they did that, but it was $6.95, what's there to complain about? The taste of the pad thai was how you expect it to taste, so nothing funky there. When the pad see ew came, a lot more food looked present than in the pad thai. That was a very good sign to me! But the bad thing was that it had a funky after taste that I'm not use to. It's not the typical taste that I have had at other places, and the aftertaste wasn't a good aftertaste either. I don't know if that's how they normally make it or it was just that day, but I didn't like it too much. The fried rice that my friends ordered though, especially the fried chicken fried rice looked pretty epic... I should have gotten that, had I known how much they would give for that. Well, their portions were good, but it didn't really make up for the service that bothered me a little bit. 

The waitresses were nice and served us appropriately. They took our orders in a timely fashion and refilled our waters before it hit the bottom of the glass, but the thing that bothered me was that they rushed our party a little bit toward the end of our meal. This particular location is a little small, and so larger parties are going to have a hard time being seated. My party consisted of 6 and we had a little trouble being seated. When another party came in that was 6 as well, they kind if made it a point they wanted us out to sit the next people. I understand it's a business and they want to make money, but you shouldn't shoo away the customers that you have for the next set. That's fairly rude if you ask me. So after a bit, my friends finished eating and we headed out. 

I won't be coming back here under my own choosing. I'm not really big on the service, or the taste of the Thai food, but it's decently cheap for the portions they give you and so if you want value, I will recommend this place, but not so much on taste & service.",2013-10-23 10:32:01

As soon as I walked in, the two instructors welcomed me and introduced themselves.  They were very friendly and gave me a tour and explanation on how the circuit training works.  Since this was my first time at this type of gym, I was a bit confused with how it works.  The instructors assured me that it'll make sense once we get started.  

So the class begins with the timer on the TV screens.  You basically follow the instructions on the TV screen for your section and move through each section twice.  I think these circuit classes are great for both beginners or seasoned athletes who want to fine tune their skills.

The good:
This place isn't afraid of the heat.
Large selection meats.
Affordable.

The not so good:
Crap tortillas
They skimp on the meat
Chipotle like system.

Came in to pick up some tacos to go and ordered 10 of varying meats.  Overall, the meat is decent. It's like a grade above Filibertos.

They measure out the meat very conservatively, using what looks like a quarter cup measuring cup, and the tortillas are run of the mill store bought tortillas, so 5 is enough for one person.

I don't have too much to say negatively, but the food experience on the whole was underwhelming at best.

When I get street tacos, I don't want to be asked about toppings (Chipotle style system), especially with as many meat options as they offer, as each meat pairs with certain taco toppings.

I told them to do it as they do it, and every taco had as much cilantro as meat and some onions.

The balance was off on them.

Also, the girl didn't get my meat selections right.

Just seems like there isn't much effort put into quality/authenticity.

I will gladly pay twice as much for tacos that have some real craftsmanship behind them.

Any ghetto looking taco shop in a shopping center that isn't a bertos clone, will smash this place, and places like Tacos Chiwas completely dominate them on multiple levels.",2018-07-26 00:08:24

This location is attached to the funky smelling Vietnamese supermarket B&T (which sets them apart, I suppose, from T&T). The prices range from $2.50 to $3.75 and the options are cold cuts, super, chicken, vegetarian (which comes with delicious tofu), lemon grass sausage and more. As is typical of banh mi the sandwiches come with coriander, pickled carrots, their special mayonnaise and, should you consent, hot peppers. The problem with that is that they refuse to spread it evenly and one gets a blob of hot spice all in one shot, in one bite and in one spot. Ouch!
On the plus side, all banh mi are made freshly in front of you. 

As to why Vietnamese sandwiches are so cheap well leave that to the wonders of 'mystery meat' and ask no questions.

I prefer their original downtown location for the simple fact that getting into and out of Vaughan Mills is a drag and a chore. Greedy mall owners stuff their premises with so many buildings and businesses that there is always a long line of cars snaking in and snaking out. It is just not worth going to the malls, which have more traffic than the 401 and less parking space than a Wal-Mart with a new shipment of tacky ladies' animal print pants.

The buns on the banh mi are also fantastic. I understand they have their own bakery in North York.

I will speak of my latest experience as my first one was a while ago at this point. 

My dining partner and I arrived and sat right near the front. After deliberating for a while with the drink list, we each ordered a glass of pinotage (a polarizing South African offering- both of us have parents from SA so it was a deliberate choice). It was absolutely delicious. Even though it was pricey, we each ordered another glass because we enjoyed it so much. ""Dark and juicy with plenty of rich damson and baked plums, a hint of coffee on the nose and soft tannins."" - definitely juicy and just so tasty!

We ordered the following dishes as nibbles to accompany our drinks:

Palak Paneer Naan Truffle Oil, Jalapeño, Peppered Honey           

Seared Scallops Thai Asparagus, Baby Shitake Mushroom, Fresh Bean Sprouts, Tagarashi  

Tofu and Vegetable Thai Curry  Green Curry, Broccoli, Red Pepper, Cauliflower, Shredded Coconut, Shitake Mushroom, Almonds

They were all quite delicious, with the scallops ranking as the least exciting (though still tasty) and the paneer naan being the dish that I wanted to scarf down the most (come on, paneer and naan fused together?! heaven). The reason I have given Kultura 3 stars despite speaking quite highly of the food is that it is overpriced, the atmosphere is a bit cheesy or something (the space IS beautiful though) and I found the service to be just OK both times I've been there.",2012-03-20 05:27:55

Of the $50 you spend per person $6 of that goes to charity to help local food banks.  At the end of the meal we each received a $50 gift card to go back!!!  I mean can you get a better deal then that???  I hate to say this but Tao's food is way better from what I can tell, but the drinks here were divine.  One of us ordered a negroni drink that was basically a show of fire and ice and smoke or something wild.  My girlfriend's and I loved the strawberry basil martini and lycheetini!  I tried the dim sum- can't go wrong there pretty much, and the Chilean sea bass.  The Chilean sea bass was overcooked and my spoiled @ss has had Chilean sea bass everywhere and neeever had that complaint.  So that was weird because I expected a lot from Hakkasan.  The dessert was pretty neat- not something my boyfriend or I would normally have ordered because it was fruity and not chocolately but it was absolutely a work of art in a glass with perfectly severed citrus fruits and something like green apple pop rocks.  It was a dessert worth a try and very neat but unfortunately the tart dessert is more of a palatte cleanser then a dessert to me.  I will be going back soon to use my gift card to try other items on the menu and see if I choose other foods if it can be better then Tao restaurant, but so far only the drinks are better.

The place is pretty basic, but a plus is there is some outside seating. Today was quite nice so outdoors we went. 

From the look of the menu, this ""Meditteranean"" place seems to be a mix....I noticed Lebanese dishes, some Greek.

I grabbed a Shish Kafta plate which comes with rice, salad, flatbread and a bit of pickled cabbage and turnip. Pretty decent lunch deal for I believe $6.95. Shish Kafta are ground up  lamb or beef made into a long hot dog shaped patty. It was pretty decent, juicy and good with the tzatiki it came with. Rice was flavorful with saffron butter in it. I also got a side of falafel ($1.29 for 3)....it was okay. They were pretty small and small makes for crunchy, but then it loses some of it's moisture in the middle so I just dipped it heavily in the tahini sauce it comes with. 

The BF got a falafel plate and that was also around $6.95. He added a side of baba ganoush (99cents) which was okay. It was more whipped instead of the usual chunky and definitely has a lot of tahini in it.

We also both got a baklava for dessert (99 cents). It's a small cut, but good. It's a lot spicier of a baklava so it's not the usual mellow honey kind. The BF like that it was very light and flaky and cites that is the ideal baklava texture for him.
 
2 plates, 2 extras, 2 drinks, and 2 baklavas- $22 and some change.

2.5 stars.

Came for happy hour, but didn't find anything on the happy hour food menu I wanted to try, so I ordered a medium Emilia Romagna pizza (mozzarella, parmesan, and 12-year balsamic vinegar- Aceto Balsamico).  Can't recall what the price was on this pizza, but it was probably around the $14 range.  The pizza came a bit too charred on the bottom, and the very thin-crust didn't stay crispy for very long, perhaps just 5 minutes, and definitely soggy by the 10-minute mark.  While I enjoyed the slice I had at the restaurant, the leftovers proved to be too salty when I tried to re-heat the pizza at home, so I had to toss the rest- not economical for the price, I'm sorry to say.  I only ate a slice at Fred's, bec. I wanted to try the cobbler-of-the-day, which was the apple cobbler topped w/ Haagen-Daaz ice cream (if I recall correctly).  Had to order it sans powdered sugar (corn allergy), and I found it good, and not too sweet.  I'd try their other cobblers, too, if they didn't come at a high cost ($9, plus the ice cream has corn syrup in it- corn allergy).  I'd also like to try the profiteroles, but they, too, come w/ a $9 tag, which means $4.50 per profiterol- I believe I'd asked how many came in a dish and was quoted two...

Don't be fooled by the scowl that the bouncer-type bartender constantly has on his face-- he actually was nice to talk to, at least the first time I spoke to him.  A couple of friends and I went there after a mixer about a month ago, and he was unapproachable, and projected himself to be too busy to do more than to come over and take our order.  No hellos and how-are-yous that night- such a big turn-off, and w/ a high-priced menu, I don't think I'll come by again.

Dim sum always has a wide variety of dishes fresh from the kitchen.  You HAVE to try the coconut jello, it's one of my favorite desserts.  The consistency is fluffy, and not quite like a jello.  It's hard to describe, but so delicious.  Plus, prices are CHEAP.  I can eat here with friends and leave stuffed and only pay $10 (including tip!).

Hot pot is also great and they qive you a lot of food in each order.  I love that each person gets their own individual pot to cook meat and veggies in, so each person can choose a different flavor broth if they want.  Plus vegetarians won't get their broth tainted by meat-eaters.

The only con is if you arrive at the busy time on the weekend, you will have to wait to get your dim sum.  Best to arrive around 10 or 10:30 to avoid the wait.",2014-01-09 23:33:06

(Pretty clever stationing himself there) He pointed to the mobile phone section and explained that Target Mobile is full-service mobile retail outlet operated by RadioShack. It's separate from their electronics department, that's why they are located in a different section of the store. Right by the entrance next to customer service.

He also informed me that the phone I was holding in my hand ( Samsung Skyrocket) was eligible for a trade in. The trade in value for it at the moment was going for $114!  Well that caught my attention! It was worth more than what I initially paid for it 6 months ago too!

He explained the trade in program to me..you are given a gift card which you can apply to your phone purchase. The trade in value depends on how recent model is and condition. You can bring as many phones you want to trade in.

The prices vary from Target Mobile, RadioShack stores and individual carriers. Sales rep explained to me they are all separate. I like that they have this trade in program deal here. I dont remember my wireless carrier offering this program.

The wireless carriers and phones I saw were Sprint, Verizon and AT&T.  AT&T seemed to be the one with the most selection and various prices.  I concentrated on upgrade prices since I already have a carrier and didnt want to change data plans.    

I knew I had an upgrade available on one of our lines and knew what phone I wanted, zeroed in on it, decided the upgrade price was right, minus the trade in value for my current phone, the S3 that I wanted came out to a pretty good deal! 

Sales rep was really friendly and  very knowledgeable and answered all questions I had about the specs for the S3 and the upgrade process. 

Transaction went pretty quick. While the sales rep worked on the upgrade process, I got my phone ready to trade in, transferred my contacts, info and pix to my sd card and restored my phone to factory settings. They'll usually do it or guide you through it but I already knew how.
 
So 25 minutes later I had a new phone!!  That's how long it took to pick, pay and switch phones, log on my new phone. add back my Yelp app and check in! That easy! Off to do my shopping.

As for the performances, most of them were brilliant impersonations. I thought the Mariah Carey was a little bland, but the Celine Dion, Liza Minelli, and Tina Turner were spot on (just to name a few that stood out in memory). The problem for me is that although they are all pretty good at what they do, it started to get a little tired about two-thirds of the way through.

The mul Mandu was pleasant and the filling flavourful.

The beef rib soup had a delicious broth with threads of chilli running through it leaving abit of spice. The only thing I didn't like is the very tough meat that was hard to remove from the bone and chew.

I've been here probably 4 to 5 times. First two or three times seemed fine. The last time I went they royally messed up my drink which made me have to return to the location to get it fixed since I had gone through drive-through. They were pleasant enough inside and fixed it but it's an issue that shouldn't have happened in the first place. This morning I went there to get a frappe  and the drive-through line was at least 5-6 cars back so I chose to go inside. Seems strange to me that all of the employees in the store would only take the drive-through orders first because they came in first rather than helping someone who parked and came into the store. Don't see why ONE employee can't be dedicated to service the customers who come into the store. There were at least 4 to 5 employees in there besides the one who is running the cash register. Surely one of them have the time to fill the orders of the customers who order at the counter. So one of the employees finally did make my drink but he read the sticker wrong and made an Iced coffee instead of a frappe so I had to wait longer yet for him to make it again the correct way. He even double checked the sticker and kind of shrugged because he knew he read it wrong. Might be my last time coming here either drive-through or inside the store. Hopefully management will get on top of this and train these employees right. *** As you can see in the photo, he just grabbed a cup to make my drink and this is what it said.

We always opted for a deluxe suite though, and usually tried to stay in the same room every time because it had special memories to us. Deluxe suites include a nice one person jacuzzi tub, a large shower, a very comfortable bed with tons of pillows, and floor to ceiling windows that are amazing if you have a city view.

It only took one incident for me to feel the need to lower my rating from 5 stars to 2.

My fiance moved to Vegas a year ago, and on my birthday he planned for us to stay in the specific hotel room mentioned in my first review, and he was going to propose. He called in advance, got the reservation for the weekend, and was guaranteed the specific room he asked for. Come the weekend of my birthday, my fiance checked in, and the man at the counter informed him that our room that we were guaranteed was given to someone else. Bummed, my fiance reluctantly agreed to accept another room. That is when he was told that, despite it being check-in time, there were no rooms available yet, and that we would have to wait. My fiance came back and told me, and we stood there and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. With our luggage right there, mind you.

An hour passed and we were still not checked in. I finally got fed up and spoke with the manager, a short blonde/light brunette female (didn't remember her name). I was firm but polite about my annoyance with the situation, and she was RUDE beyond belief. She kept talking over me, interrupting me, and telling me that we were never guaranteed the room, when yes, we were. Finally she offered to knock off $10 off our stay, and a room became available immediately.

The flour used on the wrapping/skin is not high quality flour since I am somewhat gluten sensitive and the food here triggered it.

As I am a very healthy eater approximately 29/30 days each month as part of my lifestyle, I haven't even experienced the 20 best restaurants in Columbus, my home city.  With that in mind, as a rule I generally don't revisit restaurants, especially when on vacation.   How is it that I found myself back at Bouchon only 2 days after my original experience you might ask?  Because dollar for dollar it is the best restaurant in Vegas.  It's the same reason I found myself at Bouchon Bakery four times in four days.  Call me obsessive if you like, I consider it a pursuit of perfection and as of yet I've not found anything in terms of food or service that Thomas Keller does less than perfect.

Arriving for Saturday brunch around 7:50am the night after dinner at Alex one might assume I was both happy and full...and difficult to impress.  One would be correct.  With those things in mind, the Buckeyes and Gophers game was starting at 9:00am and I was meeting friends at the Palazzo Sports Book so an early trip to Bouchon was ideal.  Seated outside I was once again greeted by the same fantastic service I received on trip one and was presented the specials including a phenomenal sounding Lobster gratin, Lorraine quiche, Strawberry croissant, and Cauliflower soup.  While the gratin was incredibly tempting the draw of the French toast bread pudding was simply too much this time around and my neighbors had the cinnamon beignets which appeared heavenly.  One French toast, one order of beignets, and a coffee please.

Unlike the first time, for this meal I was started off with Keller's famous epi-baguettes which I first experienced in NYC back in June.  Still wonderfully crunchy on the outside and soft and buttery within and served with that sinful sweet butter and raspberry preserves the baguettes were gone by the time my beignets arrived.

The beignets, as expected, were incredible.  Having tried the custard and Raspberry filled versions at Bouchon Bakery the day before I opted for the donut-esque versions this time around which were served with a beautiful apricot jam and a pot of warm Nutella.  Light, airy, sweet, and still warm/glistening the beignets were much more than a ""donut"" and when dipped in the Nutella were even better than Ducasse's famous madelines from two nights prior.  Magical.  Losing myself in the morning sun, wonderful taste, and bold coffee I slowly indulged until all the jam and nutella was spent.

Plates cleared and table dusted off for posterity, my coffee was refilled and returned along with the French Toast.  Smaller than expected, yet delicate in appearance I dug in slowly expecting to be amazed...and amazed I was.  While small, the taste was compact and potent with a creamy texture of butter cut by the texture of spiced apple and the fragrance of cinnamon.  Syrup was utilized sparingly, yet wonderfully to create a masterpiece without overpowering with sweetness.  While not a ""true"" bread pudding in the sense of the one served at Bouchon Bakery, this is my second favorite bread pudding ever behind only Nancy Olson's life-altering version at Gramercy Tavern.

Meal finished I paid my bill and thanked my server for the wonderful meal.  All things being equal I would have returned for a late brunch around 2pm in order to check out the gratin or chicken and waffles, but after hanging out at the Sportsbook for a few others my buddy made other plans.  Oh well, at least I made my fourth and final stop at the Bakery on my way over to the Palazzo for some mid-game snacks.

Two meals in four days, four stops at the Bakery, and a previous visit to the NYC location back in June...certainly not normal for me...then again, there is nothing normal about Bouchon; it is fantastic.  With fellowship interviews coming up later this year I fully expect myself to wind up on both coasts for interviews...if schedules work out, a trip to French Laundry, Ad Hoc, and/or Per Se is almost a guarantee.

In my six years in Lakewood, this is the third different bar/restaurant/gastro-whatever to be located on these premises. The last time I was here it was a Mexican place. I seem to remember a girl walking around in a Red Bull T-shirt giving people free Jello shots. For some reason, I don't remember much more after that.

That said, Deagan's, this incarnation of this place, is pretty excellent. It bills itself as a ""gastropub."" I know ""gastro"" means food...right? And ""pub"" of course means...pub. So, like, it's a bar where you can get food? That's selling it way short. I went here on a Saturday night attempting to impress a lady with my savvy dining choices. The service was fast and friendly, and their beer selection looked off-the-hook, even though I didn't order any due to the previous night's indulgences. I got the fish and chips, which was fantastic -- perfectly fried and with a just-hot-enough-but-not-too-hot sauce on the side. My, uh, dinner companion got the Ohio Beef Burger, which got high marks. And dessert got pretty crazy -- the Pumpkin Cheesecake was the largest slice of cheesecake I've gotten outside of Manhattan. 

All in all,  Deagan's is a touch too pricey to make this a twice-a-week hangout spot, but I'm glad there's a restaurant of this caliber within stumbling distance of my tiny apartment.",2011-10-11 13:44:01

1.Queso Dip with the amazing little tortillas and chips
2. Bottomless Mimosas (which have gotten kind of expensive). You still have to pay like a penny after the first one just a FYI
3. Carne Asada street tacos, fish tacos, and pork tacos (not for me).
And last but not least the best ever

The Churro French Toast with Prickly Pear Cactus syrup.

Honestly we probably only drive 45 minutes for the French toast because brunch can be cheaper so many other places but it's THAT good. Make sure you call before you go to verify they're having brunch otherwise you might be heavily disappointed.

Parking was easy, check in was fast and we were given a king suite on the 3rd floor. The elevators were clean but really slow. It wouldn't have been bad but the cleaning staff were using them most of the time and their carts took up the entire elevator. 

We arrived in the room and the electronic key actually worked the first time! The room was very clean. We had a couch that was quite comfortable, along with a flat screen TV and about 60 channels. There was also a mini bar area but we forgot to bring drinks! The lighting in the bathroom/counter area was excellent, as was the water pressure!

The bed was uncomfortable and only made worse by the air conditioner unit 2 feet away blowing directly on the bed. There were two units in the room but they were both controlled together on the wall. We had to make a choice between freezing all night or turning off the unit and going into thermal overload! We chose to leave it on half the night and turn it off the other half. Strangely enough, our friend, Larry the cockroach didn't seem to mind the temperature as he was scurrying around the bathroom in pure delight! My wife didn't have any shoes on when she found him at 2:30am so she just put the trash can over him so he wouldn't be inclined to crawl in bed with us.

The sandwich and drink were $11 and change, plus I threw in a $1 tip.  I skipped the chips to save money and the sandwich was be enough to just eat half if you aren't very hungry.  I ended up eating the whole thing.

- At my 1st visit, I was on their patio with a dining out social Group; I had 2 bottles of Moosehead to drink.
- At my 2nd visit, I was on their patio with 2 friends; I had Blood Brothers' Brett IPA to drink.

- At my 4th visit, I was inside with a 'Downtown cool bars' social Group; I had O'Hara's Irish Stout to drink.

I've quite enjoyed all 4 of my visits to the venue.  The service is quite prompt and the venue, while pretty small inside, is supplemented by their not too small front patio, which is almost always packed on a nice day.  Considering that it's in Kensington Market, it's not an upscale venue but does have quite a bit of character.  They have a really great beer selection and they are one of those venues which allows you to bring in outside food - in fact, The Grilled Cheese, another venue across the street, used to (and maybe still does) allow patrons to order take-out from them and they will actually deliver your order to you at Ronnie's.  It can get loud inside due to the size of the venue, the no. of patrons inside and the volume/type of music playing but it does tend to draw a younger clientele which generally doesn't mind the volume level.

My experience yesterday was such a big chaos and annoyance!! I brought my friends here for dinner who are on vacation here in LV.

The staff don't know how to pay attention! Waited about 15 minutes on the line. When we finally got there, the staff are serving different customers at a time! They don't pay attention on who's next! Felt bad for the old grandpa in front of us.

Two ladies were served first before him. Then they were going to serve us next, missing him again, i said, hey, this grandpa has been here waiting to be served. 

I ordered a grilled meat platter for $22.95. I asked the lady if rice is included in the platter (HEY it should right!! Especially pinoys! Who eats bbq without rice?!) But thought Id still ask. She said yes it's included. She then asked if we want soup or naked salad, since its also included. Soup with meatballs?! EW. But if its included why not. We got to the cashier and she was charging us $27.95 for the platter, im like, i thought it's 22.95. She said, with the rice and soup, it's 27.95. OK.. the lady didn't told me that! I asked if rice is included in the 22.95 platter, she said yes! She didnt mention that at at all! I mean $5 is no biggie, but because Im already pissed off by how super unorganized they were in the beginning, every little mistake will make me mad! UGH!
 
This is what really annoyed me and ruined my day.
My friend asked the cashier how to get a suki card to start getting points. She instructed her where to go and that once she got the card, she can come back with it along with the receipt. Guess what. She got the card, she came back with the receipt, and the cashier told her, ""Oh ma'am, sorry, we can't do it anymore"" WTF! She came back to the table very pissed! She was embarassed. I was gonna tell that cashier off if my friend didn't stop me! Why would you tell one thing and then not do it! UGH! 

They are pretty stingy when it comes to vinegar too! She originally gave us one small container of vinegar for the whole platter! We had to ask her to give us more. She added 2. We had to ask her one more time to add more! She add 1. REALLY! I was so pissed off! I want my vinegar on my rice and bbq so give me a bunch! Lol!

So with the platter, chicken inasal is super dry and tasted old! yuck! although pork Liempo and bbq's are good. We also ordered squid which is 2 for $14. They were bland. KAPUSO's squid is way better.

I hope the staff over here gets it together! I understand they're fairly new. But come on! Simple customer service skills, be nice, smile, pay attention, tell the truth, and don't be stingy on your sauces! GDI!

I loved the rustic feel of the restaurant and the beautiful fresh flowers on every table. I also liked that you got a lot of natural light coming through the large windows.

Now to the actual brunch...

So on the day of the brunch, when we were seated at the table and Caleb brought out the first plate for us to share, my friend pointed out that unfortunately her food could not be touching bread. So all he had to do was put the bread in a small bowl rather than mix it all together on one plate. Plus, he did not have to do this with every plate, just the one she would be eating from (1/3 plates). However simple the request seemed, this was the exchange (note that it is not verbatim, but damn close):

Caleb/owner: ""You did not tell me that when we spoke on the phone.""

My friend: ""I am sorry. I thought I did.""

Caleb/owner: ""No, you did not tell me. When we spoke you should have told me this."" As he grabbed the plate back and stomped away.

Me: ""Huh? Did he just chastise her? And did he just have a tantrum?""

11 people looked at me and nodded.

My friends: ""Wow, I can't believe he just treated her like that! How rude!""

Sigh. To say that I was embarrassed and regretting having chosen this restaurant is an under-statement. But it had to get better!

Food

We sampled (in the order of preference):

Pancakes (one stack shared between 6)-moist in the inside and crispy on the outside. Simply perfect.
The ploughman's plate (one plate shared between 4)-I loved everything on the plate-the crackers, cheeses, chicken rilette, pickled vegetables, hummus (some plates had hummus and others had chicken rilette).
The huevos rancheros (one plate shared between 6)-I love beans, tortillas and cheese. Enough said.
Canoe potatoes (2 each)-I liked the crispy exterior and fluffy center-I also thought they were well-seasoned and the herbs accentuated the dish.
Eggs Murgatroid (Benedict with chicken-each person got one egg on 1/2 of an English muffin)-loved the sourdough English muffin. I did not like that there was still fat on the chicken. Chewing on fat killed the dish for me. If the chicken had been shredded with more care, the dish would have been significantly more successful.
Brisket and grits (day special)-I am not a fan of grits. I do not eat it when visiting the south (where grits are a staple), and don't care for it here in Canada. The dish was fine, and several of my guests enjoyed it, but I did not care for it.

Deal-breakers

One of my guests does not like runny yolks, and I did tell her that she should have told me in advance so that I could have communicated it to Caleb in advance. Nevertheless, I took her egg to Caleb and asked if it would be okay to have it cooked some more. He proceeded to tell me that he could not just throw it back in the boiling water, so he would have to make a whole new one. I tried to count to 10 in my mind and keep my cool.

Asking my table if we were still hungry and needed the next course. We had a deal, so honor it. Don't try to get out of it by implying that we should be full! We were starving! We were sharing one small dish between 4-6 people!

Dishes took a long time to come out. We were there from 11am-1:30pm-2.5 hours! We had to wait close to 30 minutes per dish. In other words, we cut one small dish into much smaller portions, eat it in 2 seconds, and then wait 30+ minutes for the next small plate to share. We certainly got plenty of time to digest each dish. Could that be why were still hungry? Probably!

We were using saucers as plates, and kept reusing the same saucer. When we asked if we could have new saucers to put our tiny portion of the pancakes on, he told us that we had all his saucers and that we would have to wait while he washed them. Was this communicated in a kind and professional way to us? Nope. It was our fault for being a big group using his limited dinnerware after all. What a nuisance we were! Huh?

At around 1pm we were all staring at each other wondering if there would be a last dish. We knew from the agreement we made that there should be a sweet dish. However, there was so much confusion and frustration in the room, that I had no idea what was happening. And to make matters worse, I did not want to be the one to ask. I generally lead and attend to any concerns my friends and I have when dining out, but with Caleb's attitude, I was afraid to approach him since there was a strong likelihood that an argument would ensue-he was rude not only to me but also my friends! No one insults my friends! So a friend decided to inquire on our behalf and learned that it would be another 15-20 minutes for the next dish. So unable to wait that long, one friend left without trying ""dessert."" I asked her as she was leaving if Caleb had apologized to her when she went up to pay, or at least offered her a cookie, and she said no, he had not.

Taking his suggestion while discussing the other six varieties available I was quoted prices, terroir, and tasting notes as he prepared my single drip and with options ranging from $12.99 for 12oz to $29.99 for 12oz I was told that all were available by the cup if I wanted to taste - a mental note well engrained for my next trip to the area.

1) To their credit, the crabcakes in the combo platter were full of lump crabmeat, but mine was slightly cold in the center.  The garlic sauce was flavorful, but it was too salty and there was too much of it. 
2) The hush puppies were a bit dense and could have used butter for dipping.
3) The fries were a greasy mess - undercooked, mushy, and flavorless.
4) The corn was overcooked and covered with a salty sauce (maybe the same as the crabcake?).
5) Coleslaw was part of the combo, but they had none. We were not offered any substitutes or a reduction in price. Just ""no coleslaw for you.""

I walked in only needing wood shavings but left with a small hen feeder, an apple scented Jolly Ball, scratch for my hens, and a huge bag or wood shavings for the nesting boxes.

I don't like the parking set up much.  Seems there are a select few that feel they must park right in front of the entrance to the building.  I am talking less than 10' from the entrance.  

Can I suggest that folks avoid buying and giving their pups a 5 in 1 vaccine here?
A combo vacc is hard on the babies system.  Look up Jean Dodds vaccine protocol.

The ambience was incredible.  I went for lunch with my one of my #1 foodie partners and we could not believe the incredible food.  Chuck, the master chef was very anxious for us to try dessert before appetizers...we did not hesitate!  The chef-made chocolate ice cream was great to sample.  It was so good...I went back the next day to get some to go...with cooler and ice in tow!

I am tempted to copy the ENTIRE menu here, but will only say that everything I have had on the menu, from scotch eggs, to fried turkey spinach salad was great.

I have enjoyed Bask so much that is often my first choice for a business partner lunch.  

We have even had one of our ""KB After Dark - Crew"" Get Togethers at Bask and Chuck and staff did not miss a beat.  A+ service!!!

Alex, Chuck and Craig are outstanding owners and everytime I have gone have had an opportunity to speak with one or all of them.

Bask is a great place to go if you are looking for great wines and appetizers or a full dinner before a concert at the NC Music Factory venues.

A tip, call first to put in your order or you may end up waiting a long time. I called and it was a 45-50 min wait and then I waited further when I got there. But I'll get to that later.

I love Sashimi so I ordered the Sashimi Momiji. I'd say there were really 5 cuts of fish, but really only like 9 pieces. They had this one fish that was like almost julienned, no idea what fish it was but that was my favorite.

The packaging is kind of like what I'd find at those sushi places in malls, but it's still nicer packaging that like styrofoam. They probably had a selection of salmon, tuna, snapper and that little cut up fish that I have no idea what it was but just melted in my mouth.
I also liked the little dish to put my soya sauce in. Too many times I try to find a small container for the soya sauce for takeout and I end up using some overly-large tupperware.

The price point I think is probably right for the quality of fish, but with that said it's more expensive than many other places because quality is a bit better.

The wait though was like really long. Everyone is polite about it, waiting until they get their food. I may order again because it does taste good, but I will make sure to order well in advance.",2013-04-01 16:51:15

We were in a 1 bedroom condo and I enjoyed my stay. However, the toilet was really old and we ended up clogging the toilet somehow with toilet paper after we did number 1! The staff was quick to respond but not really. It took about an hour and several phone calls for them to respond to our flooded toilet at 1am and even more time and phone calls for them to send someone to sanitize the bathroom and give us towels.

The amenities are nice- lazy river, huge jacuzzi, free laundry detergent with a washer and dryer in each unit, basic spices in the kitchen, dish soap, and silverware and plates.

Parking is a little hard during the day but is ok at night.

I would definitely come back because my family is a Worldmark owner. However, I don't think I would personally purchase this particular chain since I've stayed at other timeshares and there are way nicer ones.

I ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread and it took a while to come out. Then my friends' food wasn't served for another 5 minutes so mine became cold while waiting for theirs to be served. The chicken on my flatbread was sparse and the buffalo sauce was not balanced with a ranch or blue cheese dressing so I was drinking my water quickly.

Was told someone would be with us soon.  After 30 more minutes pass of us patiently waiting, without anyone saying word one to us, I finally ask for a time estimate, and I am told we would be helped in 5 minutes. Someone finally seats me, and I tell her that I'm really here for my daughter (which I had told the first employee 45 minutes earlier).  Another female employee then says nastily to us, ""Well, I'm working on this woman, so your daughter's just going to have to wait.""  I should note that the woman she was working on walked in, also without an appointment, 30 minutes after us but was immediately helped. At that point, I grab my daughter and leave.

My order (don't judge me)
McChicken combo - old lettuce yuck
9 nuggets - oh YA. Just as good as I remembered them. 
1 Small caramel iced coffee
Wrap special - grilled chkn with taco mix. - This is surprisingly very delicious. They have 3 new flavours but the taco makes me wanna fiesta all the way through and out the drive thru. 

The staff here are pretty majority female. Considering this place is RIGHT across work, I've still YET to see a male employee. Oddness. Perhaps with the new renovation they are also trying to promote how well a female and kitchen/food create a happy place in the world. 

= 27.35 (I remember when a trip to McD's wouldn't cost me more than $5. My how the times have changed. ) 

If you are in the area, don't hesitate, as long as you arent ordering the McChicken. The drive thru is quick and pretty efficient. I suppose this is what happens when you put females in charge. JUST sayin.

2. Massage with Robbie
3. Facial with Claudia. 

Today I discovered that I have finally found one person I want working on me in terms of massage and what a good day it was! Robbie is officially my favorite masseuse. I have had massages in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, and San Diego and while I've enjoyed them all I have never written the person's name down in my day planner to remember to ask for that person next time. I did that today - with both Robbie AND Claudia. Robbie did my scrub and massage and he has a really nice touch - firm, but not too overbearing, with smooth transitions. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with him and I will be back to request him again. 
I also had a facial with Claudia. Let me tell you, Claudia KNOWS her business. She took one look at me and knew exactly what kind of skin I have (and therefore what products to use on me). As she went through each stage of the facial, she explained to me exactly what each step was that she was about to slather on me and what I should expect (i.e., ""Now I'm applying a pineapple and papaya [something or another], it should tingle a little bit."")

~What To Do~
Get your hair cut, colored, primped, primed for greatness

~The Good~
The stylists at each location are pretty even across the board as far as expertise goes. You can go to each location you want and get pretty much the exact hair cut. I still am amazed that no other hair place keeps your hair records like GC does. Why not, other stores?! That makes it so much easier on me, not having to remember my numbers and styles, etc. Also, as always, the discounts they have seasonally on cuts are nice on my wallets, as are the the general prices. Finally, for not having to set up appointments, its pretty fast eating for a cut.. I never have had to wait too long to get my hair cut which is a plus.

~The Bad~
Is primarily quality of the hair cut. The expertise seriously lacks beyond basic comprehension for a general haircut. I was paying a lot more for much nicer haircuts, but its not a big deal to me since I just need my hair to look decent. But seriously, everyone knows this place is for all the new hair cutters to get their feet wet in the business. If you expect anything more than a generic haircut, be forewarned. If you want a specific style, be wary, for it might not come out how you'd like it. I still think most people whom go here are already aware of most of this. Also, its hit or miss as far as the personality you work with. Some of the stylists are visibly in another dimension at times, they seem like they would rather be a garbage picker than working their....then there are the ones whom go the extra mile. Unfortunately the ones that do just that are the ones whom move up to a better job, oh well..

~The Down Low ~
This specific location is closest to me and allows me to go get my haircut for a relatively cheap rate. If I get a better job (crosses fingers) then I would really prefer going somewhere else...But until then, its Great Clips. They do get 3 stars, which I think is generous, for their haircut record keeping system, low prices/deals, and quick turnaround time for service when walking in. If you are on a budget, its a neccesity to find a low-cost barber shop. Honestly, I would prefer a local shop, but the deals that you get here are real good. I might change and go with a barber soon, but for now its Great Clips.",2013-03-11 15:47:33

The Thai lettuce wraps were quite good. Chicken was a little dry (maybe due to lack of fat--not all bad). It was actually better the next day once the flavors melded. 

However, the ""Thai Wonton Soup"" has not one ounce of Thai flavor. If you have the flu, get the soup. It's essentially an extra brothy chicken noodle soup. The name is misleading. The wontons are fine, nothing to write home about. I would have expected some thai basil or something to jazz it up.

This is a long delayed review, but I had out my experiences in the back of my mind until we met a strange character, Dr. Saul from AD at a Yelp event earlier this month.

The last time I saw Dr. Schreiber was over a year ago when I went to him for a reoccurring rash I had on my stomach (which would spread to other parts of my body). I sat waited in the office for 30-40 minutes with an appointment made the week prior, then waited for the doctor for about 20 minutes as I dressed into the paper coverings I was left. Dr. Schreiber came in, told me that the rash was due to metal contact from the button in jeans with my skin and wrote me a script for medication used to treat scabies and psoriasis without any real direction other than to apply the cream and lotion twice daily. I filled the prescriptions, and the medication was messy so application wasn't really clean cut. The medication didn't work, but I was too turned off by my first experience to come back to this office. 

After some research, I was able to come up with my own prediction- I may have been intolerant of an iron supplement added to a medication I was taking. I had the prescription changed and like magic, the rash cleared up completely within a few months. I would have preferred had he offered an allergy test or biopsy of some sort to conclude a diagnosis, but I guess he didn't have the time. 

I would compare a visit to this office to a visit to your local UMC Quick Care. There's very little compassion from the front desk for their long wait times, and the doctor makes a quick diagnosis with no follow-up what-so-ever. Maybe in some cases, his diagnosis is correct and his treatment works. In my case, it did not but thankfully I am now able to manage my skin condition.",2013-12-27 07:09:43

While pulling up they had a ""Now Open"" sign.. haven't they been open for almost 2 years now? Am I miss something? As I walk up to the door they have a pretty tacky poster board that says ""We're open everyday"" that's awesome, when did they change that because I remember coming here several times and they were closed.
I finally walk in and there's a sign that says please wait to be seated, so I'm standing there patiently waiting with my infant, staring at the server who's in the back who doesn't even notice me til I literally walk towards the back of their restaurant to go to their bathroom, which was weird and filthy, there's a random table and like some lawn mower looking thing under the table, I think that might be a hazard..

So while talking to our server, I guess they changed owners a few months ago, hopefully their customer service is better than the last and the food stays the same.

Our food comes out, everything is pretty delicious, then they began to get incredibly busy, we needed our check and a few boxes, we literally sat there while watching our server, the only server there handle 14 tables by himself, I felt bad for the kid.. But at the same time we needed our check and some boxes.. it literally took us 20 minutes to even get acknowledged, and we gave him the bill and he sat it down with some lady, randomly at the counter top, where it sat for another 15 minutes until my aunt went up there and asked the lady to run her card. The lady ran the card but charged us too much, we brought it to her attention, she didn't do anything about it and it took forever, so we didn't want to wait again, so we just told her the tip is what she over charged us with and threw in an extra 2 dollars on top of it.. Not sure if our server got the tip out of it, but I have a feeling he'd have a pretty crappy tip day anyways, all of the surrounding tables were complaining and wanting to leave too. I felt bad for him, but they need to manage their restaurant better and give this poor kid a helping hand.. hire some more help and get more organized,  or you guys will lose alot of business!

They have a great spot downtown right across the road from the Eaton Centre, and the everything inside including their dressing rooms was ultra clean and comfortable.

Service was awesome. They were very friendly and knowledgeable about what needed to get done. The price I paid was way, way lower than what I would have coughed up at David's Bridal or something.

When I got the dress back, it was perfect. Hemmed flawlessly to my height with no noticeable changes and retained the original look of the dress!

When asked if we could sit in the party room, we were told no.
The kids had a blast although little ones were crying left and right from the lack of supervision.
The worst part of all was when we were packing up to leave, we noticed that someone stole our child's shoes!

This place is pretty good , good value and good meats . One thing that I love about it is the grill, it cooks the meat fast and you don't have to worry about any pieces of meat falling through to its firey death . Lettuce and garlic is free which is a must for me when eating kbbq. 

First time I went we had the all you can eat option. Pretty much tried everything on the menu. My favorite was the kalbi and the brisket. As far as the rest of the meats, they were good and were able to satisfy my craving . However it is not the best quality . The servers were nice and helped to occasionally cut/turn the meat to make sure they are not being burnt . I did have to ask however for the Korean tea which they didn't bring out until I asked . 

Second time I went we had the combo set A . It consisted of the pork belly and brisket as the meats as well as a choice of Korean soup and fried rice to end the meal. A drink was also included (1 bottle soju or beer ). My two friends I went with aren't big eaters so I got to eat most of it ! I found the set to be good for those who can't eat much . It was yummy and had a lot of variety . 

Overall i think honey pig is a good option if you want all you can eat bbq any time of the day . Especially because they are open 24/7 ! Their combo options are nice if you would like a smaller option but also have an option for all you can eat .",2016-05-14 01:34:42

The pepperoni pizza or pepperoni and onion topping combination are also perfect. And those puffy, twisted cheese sprinkled baked dough twisties with the slightly gooey centers dipped in the delightful Michaels sauce are also perfect.

We've eaten here dozens of times and celebrated so many family milestones here over twisties, pizza and pitchers of Yuengling through the past several years. And we have Meghan, our favorite Saturday afternoon bartender. This little bar on the Southside holds a happy place in my heart.

In fact, most of my family members have also reviewed Michaels and have all given it 5 stars. My star deduction is solely based on one thing and to me it's a biggie - pizza toppings. My favorite pizza has always been pepperoni & mushrooms and they use canned mushrooms. I've tried multiple times to come up with a reasonable alternative and until we went with the onions, everything just fell short. I like jalapeños,they only have banana peppers. Tried the bacon and the spinach, nope not worthy. So pepperoni and onions it is! And I'm now a happy camper.

We've tried the hockey puck, a fried dough ball covered in sauce and its really good. The fried mac and cheese didn't do it for me & i can live with that. The hoagies come out weighing more than your head. If you enjoy a fully loaded hoagie, theirs may be your ticket to heavenly delight.

It is a bit expensive if you don't have a membership to the Botanical Gardens or the Arboretum, so if you're going to pay for admission, plan to go for a good chunk of the day. 

The highlights of this place are the canopy walk and the emergent tower (possibly extra cost if you don't have a membership).  The canopy walk is beautiful but not for those that get nervous on shaky terrain. Even though you're not allowed to jump, there will be someone who decides to jump and shake the bridge. Recommend bringing a way to carry your baby or young toddler.  Although my toddler is comfortable walking, he would have taken forever to get through the canopy walk and there is not a lot of room for people to pass.

The tower is my favorite. You first get an excellent workout climbing up several flights of stairs.  There is typically a line on nice days, but it moves relatively fast.  Once you get to the top, you're rewarded with a beautiful breeze (hopefully) and even more gorgeous view.  It is truly spectacular.  This activity is not for those that cannot climb several flights of stairs. There are areas where you can stop and rest, but again, not a lot of room to pass people so most people keep a decent pace.  

The rest of the arboretum is just a delight to walk through. Landscaped gardens, ponds, butterfly garden - lovely way to spend a day outside.  You can bring in a packed lunch and there are picnic tables near the visitor center.  If you bring a wagon for a child, be mindful that most of the ground has gravel so you're going to make a lot of noise as you pass through the park, although it might have been more of a nuisance to us than other folks.",2017-10-18 20:11:13

Salsa Blanca serves your meal on real plates and you sit in a nice dining room so it has the feel of a sit down eatery and this place has delivery service .

As for the food we find it somewhat average and for the most part what we'd expect for this kind of place .

I had the Chicken Taco Salad the meal was served on a large oval plate (not a taco shell? taco salad?) but on the up side the peppers and onions were sauteed not raw so it was more like a fajita salad so I guess that is an upgrade . I also tried a side of guacamole ,it seemed to be made with fresh avocado but it had sour cream mixed into it so for me it wasn't the best but it also wasn't the worst either (I really hate when guacamole is frozen or made with frozen avocado) I confess I was not a fan of the seasoning on this particular chicken in my salad but they offer others .

My husband had a combination plate of three things with rice and beans . This place fresh fries your taco so it is one better for tacos than some places that use the shell out of a box . The chicken in his enchilada looked like white meat shredded he thought his meal was OK . I might also need to note we were checked on several times by many different people....so I can say service is stellar .

We have many similar restaurants in this area and Each one is unique and each one does at least one thing better than the others . For a low cost fast casual meal out it's OK .",2011-05-19 13:17:59

Some of NY branches make great burgers including the first store in Madison square park of NYC but not all branches. Finally opened in Charlotte and was not great as much as I expected. Ordered shake burger and the patty was not that juicy. Also adding cherry peppers and pickles was not a good idea as it gives too strong flavor. It was not balanced well with other ingredients. BBQ cheddar and bacon burger was okay. Sauce was good but a little salty and patty was a bit dry. Still like their soft bun and crispy french fries. Somewhat upgrade version of fast food burger but still can do better!,2018-06-16 16:16:14

I'm budget-conscious (save more, spend more!), 2. it's several miles drive to another Walmart, and 3. for health reasons I don't have the ability to have to run all over NE Phoenix to do a few simple errands that I can often get done right here.  Plus - there are some things I can only get at this store and not at other grocers or even at the next closest Walmart.

That said, i'll be honest, this store continues to be a mixed experience and this 5 start rating and following review comments are LIMITED ONLY to the topic of their employees and service:

Several of the employees at this particular store are truly wonderful people, some of whom have worked there for years and I'd like to give them mention by name.  They deserve special recognition for not only a job well done but for standing out -- in a positive light -- among their peers as excellent representatives of this Walmart Supercenter:

NEDDY - always cheerful, kind, friendly and obviously a very hard worker
BONNIE - we miss your friendly helpful nature at the self-checkout now that you've moved to pharmacy...  you always kept things moving with grace and ease
NADA - warm and helpful, a fast, competent worker
JAIRO - friendly and very helpful, knows his stuff
JESSIE - always upbeat and friendly while obviously extremely competent and a real hard worker
MAGGIE - fun and friendly, she really knows her job and how to keep a cool head
AMANDA - lovely person and so helpful

There's also a woman w/long red hair (and an adorable grandchild that I met once while we were all in line :-)  I'm so sorry i didn't get her name but I'm sure her manager will be able to ID her...  She's super pleasant and one of the most efficient, competent cashiers I've ever met (along with the others mentioned here, of course!)

The 2 male greeters on the evening shift...  one from back east, NJ, I think: he's funny and friendly -- always makes a visit to WM an adventure.  And the other gentleman wears a small neat ponytail.... he's more understated but warm and friendly - always makes me feel welcomed though the door!

And last but not least, the evening shift front end manager, Lou.  (not sure about title).  Lou deserves a hearty pat on the back and not only recognition for her own hard work and friendly, pleasant attitude (especially considering the pressures she must face), but she also deserves kudos and recognition for leading a team of so many outstanding representatives for Walmart in a store that still has some serious challenges.  

Thank you, Lou and thanks to your wonderful staff!

The hot tea is really good and they would refill it (including a fresh tea bag) as much as you wanted.

The other adventurous sandwiches are roughly $10.
I HAVE to go back and try this Smores one ... It just sounds divine!

They have limited seating which kinda sucks because then you are stuck taking it to go and with winter around the corner, you can't sit out in the sun. 

At the end of the I think $6 for a grilled cheese is a bit much because it's around $3 to actually make?  But you can't argue that this is a great sandwich with friendly chatter from the staff and fresh (and sometimes healthy) ingredients going into your creation.

This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Champaign. It is always super busy and you have to wait in line whether it is before they open or any time during the day. Part of the demand is the small restaurant space, but the food itself is top notch and likely the best BBQ restaurant in IL. I have been here twice and only tried the burnt end sandwich. It is always too busy for me to come for dinner especially if you have a kid due to the limited booth spaces. The burnt end sandwich is a culinary masterpiece due to the nice smokiness of the the beef along with the crunch of the cole slaw and the acidity/sweetness of the georgia peach bbq sauce. I like my bbq sauce with spices and on the sweet side. They have a large selection of bbq sauce which I have not even tried yet. You also get a side which for me is the double baked potato. This is simply cooked to perfection loaded with cheese not too salty or heavy. I always want to try something else for lunch, but just knowing the burnt ends are limited makes me order this off the menu! Easily a 5 star + restaurant down here in Champaign

Pros: flavorful bbq, great sauce selection, the dishes are well balance and have the right taste along with the perfect texture blend

Cons: you have to wait a long time if you come late, we were here 5 minutes early and the restaurant was immediately full after they opened the door and the line was forming around the corner

By the time I finished eating it, I didn't have room for anymore. From what my co-workers said, the chicken was extremely good too. Their drinks were also not expensive.

Well, I visited the Apple Store today to buy an iPhone 6 or 7 to upgrade my iPhone 4.  A total waste of my time.  Here I am, walking into your store wanting to spend money, and no one seems interested in helping me.

First, when entering the store, there is no obvious method of getting in line.  The store didn't appear significantly busy today, but I walked in and wandered around the store for 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged that I was in the store.  Finally I approached a guy in the Apple red shirt and asked to be helped.  He asked my name and typed it into his iPad and said someone would be helping me in 5 minutes.

Second, where's the transparency in whatever line I'm in waiting for customer service?  I waited another 10 minutes and no one came to me to help.  It would be nice to have some transparency about what line there is.  I don't have a clue where I am in line and just wait.

Finally, I just gave up and left.  No way do I want to return and try to again figure out what the customer service is at the Apple Store.  I'll by my iPhone 6 or 7 from Best Buy or directly from Verizon.  Easier and without the Apple Store hassle.",2016-12-14 22:48:21

There are several cases full of a wide range of pastries, shelves of bread loaves in the back and a list of cafe drink options to combine into a meal or the perfect snack. I randomly chose a cannoli, a Portuguese egg tart (not in the case but they had them in the back - so ask if you don't see them) and a Portuguese shrimp dumpling. The three treats came out to only $4.80!! They also have soup and sandwich options but I didn't get past the pastry case options to consider them. 

The cannoli was delicious, and my favorite of the three choices. The pastry was thick but crisp, which held up against the (almond?) paste filling and a thick drizzle of chocolate. The Portuguese egg tart came in second. The tart shell was super thin but leant a different texture to the generous amount of golden egg-custard filling. A slight caramel flavor in each bite was great. Last was the shrimp dumpling, well made and cheesy but I used it more as a palate cleanser from all the sugar I was consuming. Great old-school local bakery to grab a bite, spend a couple hours reading and maybe take a loaf of bread home afterwards.",2017-02-28 17:45:39

We ordered our dishes, and spring rolls to start. This was a mistake. Not because they weren't good(which they were. Not great, but good), but because we were both full less than halfway through the main course. The portions are quite large!

I ordered a noodle dish with coconut curry, cabbage, potatoes, bean sprouts and other deliciousness.

A few hours later T.J. called me and explained that when I had the car in to get my fan clutch replaced they had accidentally tightened a screw into my radiator causing the leak.  He told me they had a new radiator ordered and I could pick it up later in the day no charge.

They ordered lobster bisque and French Onion soup which they both enjoyed, side salad w/ their dinner was pretty big, and steaks were cooked perfectly. We ordered a side of sauteed spinach and asparagus spears which were both good as well.  Drinks were constantly being replenished during our meal without having to ask.

I would definitely recommend Canal Street to other clients if they're staying at the Orleans Hotel.

It's kind of shady to do that, just pick the stuff up and serve it from a standing position.

Didn't hurt that they were promoting all sizes of dimsum at one price : $2.25.

I'm ready to give them the benefit of the doubt that weekdays is not optimal for their dimsum.  One cart sits in the corner steaming the same dimsum all through lunch service while another holds room temperature fried items.  This is because only three tables out of over a hundred (most of which are empty) are ordering dimsum - the rest are eating from the buffet, where I found only two items possibly worth eating.

The best one was the Chiu Chow dumpling stuffed with moist flavorful pork, veg and peanuts.  The shrimp dumpling wrapper suffered from sitting in the steamer too long.  The beef ribs (their take on the usual spare ribs) were quite tasty and probably not as sensitive to over steaming.

I'd be wiling to give them another try on a weekend.  Dimsum needs flow.  They should just make it to order like China Chan on the West side on weekdays and carts only on weekends.",2009-01-26 07:24:55

banana cream pie was good-very little banana-but cream & ala mode were very smooth and sweet.

they had coke & mr. pibb, the iced tea was a little watered down.

It's pay what you can, which is great, but they are moving locations soon, and the art exhibits currently on display were disappointing to me. There was a fountain on display outside the building, which was interesting but I didn't realize it was one of the 3 pieces on display until I went in and saw just how small this place is. There was a video, a sailboat on it's side and a chalet. That was it. It was interesting to walk through the chalet and look into the boat and be able to touch the objects that were part of each display. The video seemed interesting but was approx 45 mins long and we didn't want to sit through it. All in all, it seemed like a waste of a trip.

I'm not sure if I'll visit the new location. I took me years to get to this one, only to be disappointed at how little it had on display.

But I wasn't really hooked. Then, a few years ago, my girlfriend introduced me to PT Noodle and re-acquainted me with Vietnamese food. I'm hooked.

Even in the dead of summer, a big bowl of Pho sounds good because the quality and freshness of the ingredients is impressive. If you doubt the power of first impressions, understand this. I still remember the conversation between my girlfriend and I about the freshness of the produce and the quality of the proteins. For this reason alone, we have been regular customers ever since.

While she is a creature of habit here, I decided to venture off and try something different on our recent visit. We've enjoyed the spring rolls before, and they're excellent! They are a delicious start to a meal on a hot summer night.

It doesn't matter if you're a Pho traditionalist, or enjoy other rice or noodle creations, the flavors are always incredible. Oh, and the Pho is so filling. It's a generous portion.

We have been watching Bobby on the food network forever and I have been to Mesa grill in New York, but wasn't exactly blown away. 

The ""Vegas Experience"" far exceeded our expectations. 

The vibe is cool, it's very laid back and not nearly as stuffy as many of the high end restaurants in Vegas. You can walk in there wearing jeans and a t shirt (as I did b/c I left my freshly pressed collared shirt in the rental car) without a smug or dirty look from the host/hostess. 

The Food:

Bread (off the hook, give me more please)
Freshly baked varieties including  an amazing raisin bread, sourdough with cheddar and jalapeno and a freshly baked soft and moist corn muffin

Roasted Corn Soup
Excellent smoky, roasted corn flavors, very light and well seasoned. Excellent start to the evening

BBQ Duck Blue Corn Pancake
Lots of duck in this bad boy. Duck was very tender, well seasoned and the blue corn pancake, although a bit soggy, was a nice touch.

Fire Roasted Veal Chop
The most delicious, succulent, tender chop of veal I have EVER tasted. Topped with a spicy sauce that was truly incredible and a perfect balance of sweet, spicy and tart

New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin
GF ordered this one and she asked for it well done. I know, I know, I tried to help her understand that medium or medium rare pork is not a good idea, unless you are visiting a fine dining establishment such as this one. Despite the fact that it was well done (and cooked perfectly considering the fauz pas) this dish was killer! It was tender, spicy, sweet contrast and just delicious, served with a tangy and spicy BBQ sauce that was an excellent compliment to the dish. 

Coconut Cake
This cake is moist, soft, spongy and amazing! As many non coconut fans are thinking (I hate coconut) not to worry. It's the freshest combination of coconut flavor and sweetness, with an piping hot (luke warm) cup of coffee, makes for the perfect dessert. Had I not given up drinking years ago, I would have enjoyed a glass of Port with this dessert and it would have been the perfect yin to this sweet and tasty yang. 

Our waiter and the entire wait staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, to make our date night/pre show experience very special.

Las Vegas has a unique baseball scene. Without a Major League team, the Las Vegas baseball scene is a melting pot of baseball team fans from throughout the Country. Because Las Vegas is in need of a Major League baseball team, baseball fans unite at the 51s minor league game. Cashman Field is the home of the Las Vegas 51s, who are currently the NY Met's Triple-A affiliate team. Born and raised in New York, this adds another dimension to the 51s game.

  Cashman Field stands proudly in downtown Las Vegas. It is a homerun-out-of-the-park-hit from the Historic Mormon Fort where the City of Las Vegas began. It is off of Las Vegas Boulevard a few miles north of the glitter and glamor of the Las Vegas Strip and two traffic lights north of the I-515/US 93/US 95 freeway.

  On good days parking is as easy as finding a slot machine in a casino. On crowded days parking is a challenge. Regardless, the $4 parking admission is relatively inexpensive. The best way to describe the parking lot is a lower and upper parking lot. Cashman Field is built in a hilly area that some would argue would make a nice park if Cashman Field is relocated. A grassy hill separates the upper and lower parking lot. The hill affords a showcase view of the stadium and a distant Frenchman Mountain. Children love playing on the grassy hill. Adults love walking down its concrete walkway in anticipation of the game.

  The admission ticket process is fast and smooth. The general admission is $8 per person. The stadium is simple to navigate through. A bonus is that they hand out booklets showing the game schedule and baseball players.

  At Cashman Field, the majority of the seats are field level. Every time I watched baseball here, I sat on bucket seats with a cup holder instead of bleachers. Bucket seats add to the quality of the baseball experience because they are much more comfortable than bleachers. Besides seats, there are a couple of grassy areas for people to watch the game. There are zero nosebleed seats unless a foul ball was to strike a spectator's nose. Nearly every seat outside home plate is in a foul ball zone. The reality is that fowl balls frequently land in the crowd causing a need for spectators  to be alert.

   In my opinion the seats overlooking first base are the best. First base is where the 51s dugout is. From my first base seat, I had a close-up perspective of the 51s and possibly future NY Met's stars walking to the dugout. Occasionally one of them would toss a ball toward these very seats.

  Minor league baseball is more than a game. It is Entertainment!. The 51s mascot Cosmo the Allien has all the bases covered when it comes to entertaining the crowd. During the game, fans do the stretch. There is an opportunity for fans to catch a t-shirt. After the game, children had the privilege of running along the bases. 

  Cashman Field holds 9,934 seats. When we attended the game this past Sunday there were closer seats sitting empty. Security made sure they were empty. When fans attempted to grab these seats, Security stopped them. Security was protective of the season ticket holders seats. Cashman Field is one stadium where playing musical chairs is prohibited. 

  Cashman Field is a minor league stadium where fans enjoy the baseball tradition of a hot dog with a beer or soda. Their concession is nothing fancy. It is just your basic ball park snack bar. I must state that draft beer has gone up. Draft beer was $7 and a pretzel was $4.

  Is the Las Vegas baseball scene better for day or night games? There is so much to do in Vegas at night. When the weather is beautiful like it was this past April Sunday, when I saw the game, I prefer day games. I am an outdoor enthusiast who appreciated sitting outside in beautiful weather. Fast-forward  to the summer when the desert is baking hotter than an oven, I prefer night games.

  In the news, I hear all this talk that Cashman Field is outdated and it needs to be torn down !? Cashman Field is not a work of art like the PGE Park in Portland. Cashman Field is a minor league stadium that is current with the times, is affordable,  a component of the Downtown Cultural Corridor, and convenient to the majority of locals and tourists. With that said, I think there will be at least a few more baseball seasons that I will be playing in the Las Vegas baseball scene having a good time in  Cashman Field.",2014-04-13 07:58:07

My boyfriend and I were totally wowed on our first experience at Jailhouse by the service, food and atmosphere here. Our waiter was fun and full of energy. He is the type of waiter that you can tell is jazzed about their job and the menu. He told us about his favorite dishes as well as the coveted Gorgonzola sauce that would change our lives. 

We decided to order the Pesto Parmesan wings and the special of the night which was Osso Buco Stroganoff. The wings are a good size and the pesto parm flavor is delicious. Where else have you seen this combo? I could not get enough of the Stroganoff. The meat was fall off the bone and packed with flavor. You could easily tell the spaetzle was made from scratch and the fried mushrooms... Oh my gosh...! 

Another great feature of this place is they have a huge patio and local bands that play often. We were able to enjoy sitting on the patio and listening to music while we ate.

I came here a couple weeks ago and received sub par service but because I had really great experiences in the past I decided it was only fair to give them another chance as I may have just come on a bad day. Today I brought my entire family and talked so highly about Sakana prior to arrival, only to be disappointed. 

Took us about 15 minutes to get our waters and we were the first guests there. I asked if they could do no rice rolls and our server told us multiple times that they could then another server came up to us and proceeded to say that it was not possible and they would charge us ON TOP OF THE AYCE PRICE! 
Determined to not let it ruin my experience I passed it off as a misunderstanding and waited and waited and waited for our rolls. It is currently 12:54 and I've been here since 11:30 and I'm still waiting for rolls I ordered over an hour ago. 

I ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream a la carte and they came out with the most pathetic excuse of a scoop of ice cream. Their ""scoop"" bad basically 2 spoon scoop, something a grown adult can basically finish in 2-3 bites. When I brought it up without server she gave us attitude me proceeded to respond ""well that's our scoop"". For the price that I'm paying ($2.50) I'd at least expect a decent scoop of ice cream. 

I've always loved Sakana and was originally going to give this 3 stars because maybe I came at a wrong time, but my experience only got worse the longer I stayed.

I met a friend out for dinner last night. Initially I was in the mood for deep-fried goodness, so we ventured to D's Six Pax and Dogz.  Unfortunately, D's doesn't serve food after 10pm on the weekends.  Luckily, The Map Room was open, and the kitchen was still making food.

We sat down and were greeted by our friendly waiter. While we continued to search for an entrée we ordered fried zucchini and crab cakes.  We were also served some tasty local beers- delicious!

Our appetizers came in 10 minutes, and we quickly dug in.  The zucchini was perfectly fresh, and hand breaded.  A tasty dipping sauce was a nice accompaniment for the crispy veggies.  Homemade crab cakes were equally as good.  Large chunks of sweet crab, breadcrumbs, and egg bound the sautéed cakes together.  A mild tartar sauce complimented the pronounced flavor of the dish.

House salads came before our entrees.  Fresh greens, ripe cherry tomatoes, large slices of red onion, fresh (homemade) croutons, and herbs made for a flavorsome mixture.  The homemade blue cheese dressing was sweet, and creamy.

Entrée were next.  I chose the fish and chips.  Large portions of fresh fish were served with hand-cut fries.  Rich beer batter coated the perfectly cooked, golden brown fish.  The fries were crispy, and well seasoned.  My dinner mates chose risotto, and pasta with mushrooms with veggies- both dishes were delicious.

The food at the Map Room is sophisticated, and enjoyable.  The prices are moderate for the area.  If you're looking for a new spot to enjoy some well-prepared food, give the Map Room a try.",2013-07-09 18:11:06

JJBC is a small brewery here in Southern Nevada.  They distribute to about a dozen different states right now.  As a local, I am proud of what they have done for Las Vegas and craft beer.  

The free tour happens every third Saturday of the month.  Ours was started by Matthew Lisowski, the owner of the brewery.  Matt gave us an introduction and a short history of the brewery, including where the name came from (you will have to go on the tour to hear the story!).  Then Alex, the head brewer, took over the tour while Matt constantly poured us samples of the various beers that Joseph James makes.  It was really neat to drink really ""green"" beer straight out of the fermenter.  One such beer was a Steam lager that was a recipe by a local homebrewer, and was probably my favorite beer of the tour.  We also had a couple of other special release beers like the Hubub, a super hoppy, unbalanced beer that was brewed just once.  The 6 pack was free!  

Matt definitely goes out of his way to make everyone feel at home in his small brewery.  We got to see the mash tun, the boil kettle, the grain mill, and various huge fermenters fermenting away.  As a homebrewer, it is always fascinating to see how the pros do this stuff.  Joseph James is a very intimate brewery, with a small staff, but they have some good beer, like the Red Fox Imperial Stout.  

If you want to do the tour, just give them a call ahead of time and reserve a spot for you and your friends/family.  As others have mentioned, they also make soda, although you do have to be 21 to go on the tour.",2011-07-19 23:28:20

She was speaking the truth; we have been customers of this dealership since they were smaller and across the street from S&D Coffee. We have bought countless cars from them and have sent our entire extended family to them. She mentioned that we would not look for service elsewhere. While I wouldn't have expected in a million years that she was wrong, she was. Over the past couple weeks we have seriously considered purchasing a new car from this location. The sales guy we dealt with was very nice, helpful and patient (hence the one star). We visited multiple times trying to narrow things down and talked a lot via telephone. Tonight we spent time trying to reach a deal and we were literally shown the door. We were interested in two different cars with slightly different prices. We took all the information offered by the dealership and made a counter on one of them (it wasn't even a crazy request). The sales manager came out and while he thanked us for showing up, he literally cut us off at the knees and did not entertain any further deals OR revisit the other car we were looking at. We have NEVER been treated like this in all of our car buying experiences. Perhaps they were upset we had compared prices from another dealership? It's not like we did it on purpose (it's not our style but what smart purchaser wouldn't anyway?), but we have looked at this particular car for a while and have visited various dealerships depending on where we were at the time; other numbers just came with the territory. We ultimately ended back up at this dealership because we are LOYAL customers even though their prices were slightly higher but that was the wrong decision. This sales manager was not interested in selling a car or even respectfully dealing with us. Simply saying thanks doesn't do much when your undertones are rude. Even if the dealership was unable to meet what we wanted, they could have dealt in a MUCH better manner and not made us feel as if our business is worth nothing and we asked for the moon. Decades of loyalty thrown down the drain in an instant. Literally. An ENTIRE family of customers will never visit this place again.

As a disclaimer, I had lunch and not gelato.

Two things to note here...

The place is a frantic mix of lots of things. If you are thinking ""I want coffee, Asian dumplings, gelato, a sandwich, and a hot plate lunch special"", this is the place for you.

The plate lunch I had was a pricey, $16.95 plate of brisket with succotash, chimichuri, and sweet potatoes that was filling, yet too salty.

I'm not that crazy about Greenhouse Tavern for lunch.  Service was slow on multiple occasions, which is really irritating when you need to get back to the office.  The lunch menu also seemed fairly pedestrian for such a well-regarded establishment, and the actual food (I recall having the Beef Dip sandwich) failed to impress.

Dinner was a substantial improvement.  I really enjoy the French Breakfast Radishes--a simple dish, but one that I think fills the appetizer role nicely without getting you too full.  We also had some poutine, which was listed on the menu as Gravy Fries--french fries (or pomme frites, whatever) covered in mozzarella cheese and brown gravy.

For a main course, I had the Roasted Pig's Head after the server's recommendation (""What's the best thing on the menu?"").  Any Anthony Bourdain watchers out there might remember the Philippines episode where Bourdain has some lechon (roasted pig) in Cebu and tells Augusto that once the lechon is out, he's going straight for the cheek.  Now I can see why--the meat is extremely tender, albeit quite fatty (so don't be surprised).  The barbecue sauce that covered the dish was a little strong, but tasty.  I wonder if Jonathon Sawyer would consider adding a side of Mang Tomas to go with the dish.  The presentation is literally half a pig's head (I got the left side) flat on a plate, nose (oh wait, snout) and all.  The kitchen is willing to cut it up and portion it out if it bothers you, but my recommendation is to just dig right into the pig's face.  (It's smiling at you!)

The vegetarians have surely stopped reading.  The general environment at the restaurant is trendy casual.  I'm not really into the locavore philosophy, so I don't really add any premium to Greenhouse's dedication to the concept.  Actually, I think it really hurts their bar when you can't get your cocktail of choice.  Overall, I don't like Greenhouse Tavern as a lunch spot, but it's a fairly decent place for dinner.  If I only judged the restaurant based on dinner, I think it would seriously contend for four stars.  But, with my lunch experiences, I have no qualms dropping it down to three.",2010-10-30 06:05:49

First, with arrangements having been made beforehand (as you should with a group), they were most accommodating! The service simply couldn't have been any better for our group!  Ian, the Manager, personally made sure that everything was taken care of for us.
Those in our group tried quite a variety of things from the menus.  So first, about the menu... they are very extensive and include dishes from several areas that geographically surround Malaysia.  They have everything from Japanese Sushi, to Indian curries, to multiple Chinese favorites.  They even have some Malaysian specialties on the menu too!  ; )  Some of the dishes that seemed to stand out for our group included the Malaysian Sea Bass and another Malaysian dish made with Stingray (or Skate).  I had the Curry Duck and thought it was quite good! I think that everyone in our group enjoyed the dishes they ordered, and that (for me) is quite a statement!
The location is great for dining before or after downtown activities or sporting events and there is adequate parking on both sides of the building.

SfZdifBhgHcqU7Tl5gmy8Q,PBV_oQCoABX958-zjiLGwQ,9v9cMGBpUm_IzTuPfXXEOw,2,7,2,2,"I'd like to preface this review to say the food we ordered at this time (9:30pm-10:30pm) were tasty and adequate for a wannabe-upscale HK style restaurant.  The porkchop, French toast, HK tea, bbq eel & battered shrimp met the standards we expected.
When we dined here on a Thursday, the restaurant had a staff of 1 waiter, 2 waitresses, and 3-4 tables of diners who came at varying times. I mention this so readers can better rationalize my experience before excusing their service attitude due to being ""overwhelmed"" by customers.
I respect and follow the etiquette and suggested guidelines for tipping, and NEVER have I encountered a disappointing experience where I walk away without tipping until now.  The food was good, and the portions were so large we had leftovers, but this was when our dining experience went downhill and possibly past the 9 rings of hell.  
The only service we had was a waiter took our order, and the waiter and waitresses came with the food. Nothing further. Nobody asked ""Can I get you anything else?""  At the end of our meal, we made eye contact and tried to get the waiter's attention (no call button). He made eye contact but continued to serve other tables, amongst them a table of 10+ who had just sat down and ordered their drinks from a waitress.  After failing to get our waiter's attention, we attempted to make eye contact and wave for any of the three servers' attention so we could get our bill and takeout boxes to pack leftovers. Minutes pass, and they were so transfixed with providing excellent customer service to the larger table that had now ordered beers, I decided to go find the takeaway boxes on my own (they were in plain view about 20 steps from our table, near their customer washrooms).  Just when I grabbed the boxes I needed, one of the waitresses approaches and says in Cantonese, ""Can I help you with something?"" and not even the slightest apology for having made us wait, or for their preoccupations elsewhere. So in response, I asked her if we can please get the bill.  
I return to our table, the waiter approaches and puts down the bill. After tax, our meal came to $37.59. Implied gratuity etiquette suggests customers should give a 10% tip before taxes for services rendered. The waiter and waitresses served us food. But they did not follow through at the end of our meal (I hypothesize that's because they must have thought the bigger table of diners could give them a bigger tip at the end of the night). With this lack of service, admittedly, we gave them $40 cash and did not ask for change and that meant only 7% tip and not 10%. 
The waiter stands beside us, sees the $40 cash, and doesn't take it. I thought he didn't pay attention (just like most of the evening), so I said take it and we don't need change.  He takes the bill, points at the final amount, and says he can't take the money until I put down more gratuity. My immediate reaction was ""What?"" and confusion. He repeats, that I need to give him more tip, and then he further reiterates that I need to give him more tip because the economy is bad.  As if.......the economy is not bad for everybody?  Let me rephrase: he did not say he wanted more tip because he felt it wasn't enough for his services--he wanted more tip because the economy is bad.
I ask him, ""Why should I tip you more for service you didn't provide? Why should I tip more when I had to get my own takeout boxes because you ignored us?"" I ask to see his manager because I need to understand why I'm wrong.
He pursed his lips and waved over a waitress.  Expecting her to rectify the situation, she also points at the bill and says that I did not tip enough because tip is ""supposed to be"" 10%.  I repeat there was a lack of service and I'm not asking for change. She repeats I'm ""supposed to"" tip 10%.  Supposed to. Has nothing to do with service.  Making my decision, I said I am not tipping 10%, and in fact, I'm now not tipping at all and want my change back.  The second waitress returned with my change, didn't apologize and also defended that 10% is mandatory.
I always tip even if the service is bad, but never have I had a waiter stand around insisting that I open my wallet and give him more.  I have never waited tables, so perhaps there's a mentality to tips that I don't understand as a customer who experienced really poor service.  But penny pincher pound foolish, their insistence on me adding extra gratuity has lost 2 returning diners.
The economy is bad and affects us all. You make a desperate choice and give 100% customer service to a bigger table of diners and ignore us. Based on the waiter and waitresses' defense for insisting on a 10% gratuity without acknowledging that gratuity has a positive correlation with service, I do not expect this restaurant to reflect on any of the customer reviews presented here in order to improve their service and business management.",2014-05-23 04:39:55

Looking for a restaurant that compares to Island Sushi is difficult in Las Vegas, so I looked for a four plus star restaurant. The restaurant is compact with wooden tables, wooden floor, and little room to move in. I started thinking that maybe I should go to Diamond China for their delicious steamed fish. I got a menu to order take out... Holy!!! Korean food?! Great! I am tempted to order here now being a fellow Korean.

I got the spicy chick (Korean style) with the hopes that it compares with my mother's. Brown rice added. The server came and gave me boiled peanuts and water as I waited for my order. This is the first restaurant in Las Vegas that I have been to with a boiled peanut appetizer. Amazing!!! So far, so good.

Korean spicy chicken is usually only good if the bone(s) are still attached to the chicken. I took some boiled peanuts to go along with some sriracha sauce to mix with the brown rice. The chicken is delicious although it came in chopped thigh pieces (no bones). I was quite amazed at the flavor of the dish. The take out order came with kimchi (kimchi is good, but better at Mr. Tofu) and macaroni salad as well. I think I could have gotten more chicken pieces, but it was definitely worth a try.

I am excited to check out the soon dubu as it will be compared to Mr. Tofu.",2012-08-02 20:17:52

Just as RJ said, we seemed to keep buildling towards something. There was an escalation of sorts at hand, if not in terms of quality but size, stature, poshness of surroundings. Zeeno's was still on top, defeating Sal's, demonstrating that a pizza needs to taste better than it looks. The unassuming Zeno's was on a tear. 

So here we were, working our way down Carson, finding Pizza Sola. There are stools, hard, finished wooden counters, a young perky gal behind the counter. This was a New York pizzeria by way of Shadyside. 

The pizzas behind the glass were even better looking than that ones at Sal's, more sophisticated, as if they actually read books that weren't about beauty, celebrities, or metrosexual vampires. One can have an intelligent conversation with this pizza. 

I bucked the trend somewhat and went with a white pizza adorned with breaded eggplant. 

It was like Sal's Pizza (large, crispy crust) but even bigger and with more flavor despite it being sauceless. This was the smarter sister, the one that rebels by going to poetry readings and book club meetings instead of house parties. She's also better looking, knows it, but isn't hung up on it. She doesn't even wear makeup. She doesn't need to. 

If there is such a thing as Gourmet New York Street Pizza, this would serve as an example. The eggplant worked brilliantly as a topping as well and was a new twist for me.

I tasted RJ's standard pep pizza and Kay's plain Sicilian after they griped about the sauce tasting canned. It took a few tastes, but yeah, it came off as supplied-by-third-party-in-buckets as opposed to made-by-Nana-at-6-this-morning. 

She's a brainiac, a knockout, and sees modeling as a sideline to a career in academia.

But she eats ice cream bars incessantly, leaves candy wrappers everywhere, makes a weird grunting sound when she laughs, and is obsessed with Cake Mania. She's a keeper though. Nobody's perfect. 

Right now, Zeeno's and Pizza Sola are tied.  

Which one will I marry? Dilemmas...I have 'em...

The patty was one of the better veggie burgers I've had in comparison to other bar restaurants I've been to so I recommend it for my vegetarians out there. However, the salsa on top was a weird choice, and it didn't go well with the burger in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered the nachos as his meal which he would not recommend.

However, I'm so disappointed to say that today's experience was anything but satisfactory. Although an employee that normally works when I visit the store WAS there he was attending another customer. He said he would be with me in a moment, which is fine by me but another employee (whom I have never seen before) came to take my order. This employee began by saying (to me) ""I'm not really working but I'll help you anyways since he's busy"" ok?? Like he has to let me know that he's doing me a favor?!? In my experience as long as I am behind the counter (since I was a Starbucks barista) I am on the clock and even if I am not I wouldn't tell the customer that! I'd gladly take their order and help them the best I could to represent the company. Afterall, whether I am ""on the clock"" or not, I am still a part of the team. This guy thought he was doing his part anyways. 

Here's what happened. Just at the moment when the employee asks me ""What can I get for you?"" another young woman walks in behind me and he immediately interrupts me as I was starting to order and greets the girl by the name asking her what she's gonna do today. He then apologizes BRIEFLY saying, ""Sorry, I know her."" I thought to myself '...well no shit.' She answers his question and he then also asks her, ""What would you like to drink today?"" And mind you this is all taking place OVER ME as he is standing in front of me and she is behind me. He says sorry again and makes up some excuse about how he can get our drinks at the same time so he just wanted to know what her order was so he can make it while she tans.

When I finally was asked what I wanted I only was able to tell him the base, flavor and first mix-in I wanted before he interrupted me and said, ""Sorry you're gonna have to tell me over her that's a lot of stuff"" he said it in such a rude way though unlike other employees and he added with an attitude that ""I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's cool to have a ton of mix-ins, good for you!""

I think its been open for quite some time but its tucked away in the Dairy Queen plaza in a corner. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it.

I wanted to find out if I could just walk in for an appointment so I called ahead and they ended up making an appointment for me. Now I'm not sure if they generally accept walk-ins or not, so it would be best to call ahead and make sure they have space for you. 

I showed up a tad early for my appointment (maybe 5-7 minutes) and there was no one at the front desk and no bell or anything that would indicate someone walking in the main doors. I sat down, expecting someone to come up at some point; I got a phone call while I was waiting but even after that, still no one had come up. Another woman getting a pedicure told the woman working on her feet that someone was at the front. I figured out that there were about 4 other staff plus the owner hiding around back so I don't know why there was no one around at the front. I suppose that's something they should work on.

I was originally only going to get a pedicure but they had a good special on, mani/pedi for $35, whereas a standard pedicure is $29. Getting my hands done as well for $6? Sold. 

They asked me to pick out my colors and while they didn't have a huge selection, they had enough colors for me to take a minute to pick out what I wanted and it was all OPI polish. I always get a different color on my hands than on my feet (you can get away with brighter crazier colors on your feet better than on your hands, imo) and then took my seat in the pedicure chair.

The woman that did my mani/pedi was wonderful; while she didn't talk much at all, she was very professional and surprised me by asking me what exactly I wanted done at certain points during my pedicure. First of all, they gave me a ziplock bag with a buffer and a few other things in it; I can bring it back next time and they'll use the same tools on me. Cost $0.50 but its nice to know I can just pop that in my bag anytime I go there and its all MY stuff. But she ASKED me if that was okay - which I appreciated. She also asked me whether I wanted my heels razored, which no one has ever done before, they usually just do it. And she didn't go overboard - usually they do quite a number on my heels - they're silky smooth afterwards, but a lot of skin gets taken off. She had a light hand and I was appreciative of that. They also did a foot and leg massage, which was a very nice touch. I'm really really happy with the pedicure - the color is great, the nails are nicely shaped and its been lasting even though I'm wearing flip flops around and I regularly bang my feet (and as a result usually chip my pedi within days).

My manicure was a very pleasant experience - my nails are very short right now and peeling a lot but they did a wonderful job on my cuticles and shaping my nails. They look fantastic and while one of my fingers is peeling, its largely because my nails themselves are peeling. While she did her best to limit the amount of nail that was peeling away, this was unavoidable. Regardless, my nails dried to a nice hard finish and for once I didn't screw up my fingernails because the polish wasn't set yet. As with my feet, she did a really nice hand massage and overall, I was rather pleased.

The ambiance here is definitely spa-like. I don't know that I'd call it a spa, but all of the finishes are done nicely, everything looks really clean and it was a very relaxing atmosphere. The TV's were muted and there was soft music in the background. If you want to go and pamper yourself after a long day of work, this is a great place to do it.

A side note - to the woman who was bitching and complaining about the prices of the shellac mani/pedi and refusing to pay while I was having my treatments done - thank you for making a massive fuss in the store when other people were trying to relax and enjoy their treatments. Before you get a treatment, you should ASK how much it is before you get it done. This goes for anyone: their website is a tad lacking, so ask for the price lists when you go in. They do offer shellac but the price list is posted in-store, not online. 

I had absolutely no qualms with my service except that I don't like going to get a mani/pedi/spa service done where the employees are conversing with each other in another language. That has always bothered me but I suppose its par for the course. Overall, I'd recommend this place and I think it will be my new mani/pedi place from now on.",2012-03-19 03:47:45

On my quest to eat at every Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps even the world, I knew I would eventually have to be drug out of my city and into the suburbs to tick a few off my list.

This branch of Tamarind is owned by the same person(s) who manage the restaurant by the same name in Oakland. The Greentree location is more enjoyable in ambiance, largely because there is more space comparatively. The dining room is pretty and relaxing, with dark wood accents and tone-on-tone muted green striped walls. The server that helped us was excellent at doing so, attentive, and friendly.

Where things fell short for me was with the food. I enjoy a meal typically at medium spiciness or in the range of 5-6 if on a scale of 10. This is a pretty typical scale around these parts and this is the way I always order, but the Navaratan Korma that I ordered came at around an 8. I have nothing to prove by eating spicy food in terms of asserting my own toughness, so food this spicy only proves to muddle the beautiful mix of ingredients in the sauce to me. About the only other note I could really taste was a lot of sweetness, which sometimes happens with this dish. I wasn't impressed with this one though because they use a mix of vegetables, some of which come prepared either from frozen or from canned when the way this restaurant describes Navaratan's ingredients is as ""garden fresh vegetables."" Navaratan translates loosely as 9 jewels and so the dish traditionally has a mix of 9 vegetables, fruits, and nuts. This misstatement was a disappointment and was misleading, as I would not have ordered the dish if it had not been for that description.

My husband's food experience was a bit better. He got the mysore masala dosa and it was delicious. It doesn't beat the Udipi dosa, but it was the second best dosa in Pittsburgh that I've found.

We ended the meal with galub jamun, but I would suggest you skip it or try something different for dessert. It was pretty forgettable and the pieces had no texture other than mushiness.

I'm not really sure why my experience was so different from all of the 5-star ratings I'm seeing from users before me. While this wasn't a bad experience, I certainly wouldn't drive out to Greentree for a special trip. Pittsburgh is fortunate to have so many Indian restaurants, and there are far better ones out there where you can spend your time.",2011-07-17 04:32:28

It is a quaint little place on the north corner of Coventry.  There is inexpensive, relatively safe parking in the Coventry parking garage just down the street.

I have been there countless times over the years and their sushi and sashimi are always fresh.  I particularly love their lunch time sushi/sashimi combo that is served with miso soup, salad with japanese dressing, and green tea.  Also excellent are their large rolls (ie. Giant Spider roll, yum!!!) which are great for ordering for the group.  If sushi/sashimi is not really your thing, they also have a great tempura, a bento box with a variety of goods (good sampler dish), various Japanese noodle soups and noodle dishes.  All are really, really good!  

The last several years they have added some other SE Asian cuisine--I just have not tried them so cannot comment on them.

I will have to say that I have never had a disappointing meal at Pacific East and it will stand as one of my favorite places to eat.

I came specifically for pan dulce, so I didn't get the opportunity to check out much of their other inventory. Most of their pan dulce is 2 for a dollar and they have other specialty pastries for 75 cents each. The selection wasn't the best and I was a little disappointed by their freshness.

We ordered a pork belly ""slider,"" the dry dan dan noodles (with wide noodles), the golden tofu appetizer, and a bubble tea with coconut lychee.
The person taking our order (who was also the hostess) was polite and organized, and clued us in to the fact that the wide and narrow noodles (but not the rice noodles) are the ones made in-house without us even asking. I'm unable to say anything more about the service, but this is a good sign for the rest of the restaurant.
The tofu was our least favorite--we're big fans of tofu, particularly fried tofu, but this had a very very thin skin on it and the vegetarian oyster sauce drizzled over the top just didn't provide the flavor that tofu requires. We ended up dipping them in our dan dan sauce and that made them more palatable.
The dan dan noodles were good. I can see how some found the sauce monotonous, but we were splitting the entree and so were spared from some of that. The noodle texture was pleasant and the wide noodles sopped up the sauce and something nutty sprinkled over the top. Caveat: we ate these in the dark so I'm not 100% positive what all the ingredients were.
OMG the pork belly slider. I want more of these. First off, this thing was HUGE. The steamed bun was probably about the size of a waffle (husband says IHOP pancake; apparently we have a breakfast theme going), and the pork belly extended to the very edges, a veritable bargain for $6. Also, it was ridiculously delicious, so that's always a bonus. I would order from here again just for this, even forgoing the dinner theater for the immediate gratification that is takeout.
And the bubble tea was actually quite good, though perhaps a poor choice for a cold evening. I was thrilled to be able to get my coconut lychee as an add-on, as I hadn't yet found a place in Pittsburgh that offers it. They have many options beyond just boba (bear in mind the add-ons are literally added on, so you get, for example, lychee AND boba for your upcharge).
For a dinner that cost us barely $25, we were quite pleased. We'll stay away from the tofu and double (or possibly triple) down on those amazing amazing pork belly sliders! The lack of reservation ability means I'll probably only be visiting during off hours or ordering to-go, but the quality of the pork belly slider alone merits a return.",2014-11-08 04:39:28

They've got everything here: books, magazines, comics, video games for all platforms, action figures, sheet music, music on CDs, records and tapes, movies on DVD & VHS - think I might even seen a few laser discs... And porn of course (in the brown cabinet left of the entrance), if that's your thing :D

Got some trade? Drop it off on the counter on your left. They'll give you a playing card to identify your stash and an E.T.A. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 20-30 minutes for the verdict - of course I'm usually browsing for a lot longer than that. They pay pretty well. Not as much as Zia for music and movies, but they'll take stuff that Zia won't. Your choice of cash or trade credit, which is broken out into 'A' & 'B'. A is good for anything in the store, B is just for books.",2008-07-25 01:04:51

As for Lee's  Banh mi (french baguette stuffed with various sorts of meats and vegetables), they seem to actually take a full size baguette and cut it in half for the sandwich whereas in most places I go they use a small mini-baguette, which I have to say, I prefer a bit more but for the price (my sandwich was like $3.50) I'm not going to complain too much and maybe it's more of a case of what I expect from a sandwich. If I took price into account I might go 4 starts but I wanted to focus purely on the experience of the food and that means, I would eat it again but if I could get one in the more traditional fashion, even if it cost me a bit more, I would go for that type Vietnamese sandwich.

What I did like is that one can also order full size baguettes at the same time the sandwich is ordered and like the sandwiches, quite inexpensive at only $1.25 each. I bought one and started eating it on the way home (yes, I know, crumbs everywhere but that is why they have those vacuums at the car wash). I could see picking up a loaf or two of this bread every weekend as I like the crunchy crust and the wonderfully soft interior of their loafs.

I also had an iced mint milk and well, that was rather blah, tasted overly sweet and artificial so not something I would order again but they have a lot of other options.

Bottom line....the bread is great, the sandwiches a great deal if you are looking for value for your money and an okay deal if you are looking for the highest quality Vietnamese sandwich. I would check out the Tea Light Cafe at Scottsdale 101 if you want to try a really good Vietnamese sandwich.",2012-01-16 15:59:15

My boyfriend and I headed over to Soul on a random Sunday night just after 5pm in order to get one of the coveted outdoor tables to enjoy the weather over dinner. We ordered a plethora of options to share, including: 

 - White bean goat cheese dip with pita points: so good that my boyfriend, who doesn't like goat cheese, devoured it.
- Athenian tomato salsa: delicious - I thought it'd just be regular old salsa, but the seasoning was divine. 
- Veggie roll: in order to entice my boyfriend into eating sushi, we started with this option, and he really liked it. Looking forward to more adventurous options next time.
- Soul roll: this was my dinner roll - delicious with the jalapeno and spicy mayo for a bit of a kick. 
- Tuna skewer: sauce that came on this skewer was very good, and it was seared perfectly. 
- Chicken pita: great flavor and presentation.

They also make cupcakes in house and change flavors periodically, so be sure to try them all so you don't miss out!

Parking can be a bit tricky in that area, and the place fills up quickly on weekends, so head over there early if you don't want to wait.

CoolN2 as its name suggests is pretty cool (and as I am typing this, I am JUST realizing how N2 reflects the chemical name of nitrogen gas...). Their menu consists of:

ice cream - simple scoop with standard toppings
pop ice - pudding base, topped with fresh fruit, and in between are dipping-dot-like crunchy ice cream shards. The texture is definitely something quirky but fun to try.
dragon breath - cheetos spiked with liquid nitrogen that creates the illusion that you are exhaling poofs of ""dragon breath""

Also note that most of their flavours are on the light and fruity side. You won't find any chocolate-y or dense tastes.

Although this place is pricey (the cheapest item is ~$7) note that you are also paying for the show of them making the ice cream. It's a somewhat complicated process, but you get to see first hand the hydrophopic nitrogen condense as the chemicals spill over your ice cream (my nerdy side is showing!!!)

There was a small patio seating near the entrance, so I'm not to sure how guests sitting there feel if it's busy with people walking in and out. 

On to the meal. I decided to order a lime and mint drink. I found it quite sour so I will not be ordering that in the future. The appetizer chosen was the 3 item sampler that they had which consisted of a meat filled with cheese, pork belly and another item that had olives all over it (I avoid olives). 
This was followed by the seafood pasta in red sauce which was absolutely delicious!!!! I inhaled this in no time and wished the portion was larger seeing as I was still hungry. The other entree ordered was the steak with brussel sprouts, which added flavor to it, and a few potatoes.  

For dessert we decided on the gelato. Since it came with the scoops we choose lime, pistachio and chocolate. This came with a biscotti. Personally I loved the pistachio and lime the best and I expected the scoops to be larger.

I can only speak for their breakfast menu since I come for breakfast only, but I usually order the ""Lai Wan"" style congee with ""Fried Turnip Cake"" or ""Vermecelli noodles"". The congee is a heaping portion for one person (around 2 1/2 bowls worth). The turnip cake is a hit or miss at times and the vermecelli is what you can expect of fried vermecelli with egg. 

From their menu, you can either choose a congee (eg. LaI Wan, Pork Liver, Fermented Egg) plus a side dish (eg. Fried Turnip Cake, Vermecelli noodles, Chinese Fried Dough) for around 5$. Other combos on the menu include western style dishes (Eggs with ham/sausage plus pasta that comes with a drink) for around the same price. 

The food itself won't be pleasing to the eye if you're used to upper scale restaurants, but for the price and speed at which you get your food, it can be overlooked. 

The environment itself is very noisy. It's a typical chinese fast food restaurant where it is expected that once you're done your food, you pay the bill and leave. Quick and efficient. 

Overall, My family and I come back to this restaurant because we are the type of people that just want our meal and want to head out shortly after. It's a good quick stop place. It's not somewhere to go if you want to sit around and catch up with friends. 

Not bad! I will definitely be coming back.",2016-09-14 16:00:17

Expectations are high and Joel's outpost in Vegas doesn't disappoint. The recession has certainly had its effect here as I doubt many can dine on 16 courses at $385 anymore without the expense account. They now offer a variation of smaller 2-6 course menus. Simpler and perhaps with more reason. So how does this compare in the world of French Laundry, Per Se, Alain Ducasse, El Bulli? 

Pretty well.

We were staying at the MGM so the gold limo and private entrance we'll have to assume are pretty sweet. The quaint, regal homely dining room is impressive and the purple banquet seating is perfect for letting the food settle in. But the ultimate key is the food.

Highlights -

Bread cart - amazing selection, sample at least 3-4 pieces, the sweet rolls were buttery goodness
Truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage (Suppl. $30) - amazing pocket of bursting flavour, well worth the suppl and the best app
Duck and seared foie gras with cherries and fresh almonds - my love affair with foie continues with this amazing preparation
Spring lamb skewer with sweet spices, vegetables with lemon confit (Suppl. $25) - easily the best main, so tender and not a hint of gameyness.
Moka - The (i.e. French candy/chocolate cart) - This sweets cart just amazes. Like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory in French, I couldn't resist the hazelnut chocolates and truffles.

So, it is expensive and it is a dining experience worth the price. The food was top notch, the service was impeccable and the bread/sweet carts are an offering unique onto itself. I'll be back once the credit markets free up again.",2010-08-01 21:52:56

I thought this event would be the highlight of my Saturday night but it was just so boring. Maybe it wasn't for me but everything was sort of closed down when we got there but they should have at least more excitement for the late comers, but nope. The only things I liked were the chairs exhibit, doodle board, and a techno rave. I wanted to see more artwork but mainly were bunch of local artists playing their music. The entire festival was held under the bridge so the space was utilized but the capacity was large enough to place more content! An utter disappointment, I wished there were a lot more to see but barely anything. We basically walked from one end to the other, and left.

For the appetizer, we went for their vegan poutine, which to be honest was not great unfortunately.

Rodney was at the Yelp Downtown Revival party - I was bummed the bourbon was all gone by the time I got to him, and all he had going was the gin. Not a gin fan at all, he sensed my disappointment and pulled a smaller bottle of whiskey out for me to try.

It.Was.Amazing!!!
And - not available in stores - to get it, I'd have to go to the distillery in Tempe.

I did that (with Robyn N.) on Saturday after a huge and wonderful lunch - and am so happy I did!

The place is a bit confusing to get to - I'd suggest calling first and asking directions. We really weren't sure we were in the right place.

We met up with Jason, Rodney's partner and the master distiller.

While the restaurant does offer some Indonesian cuisine, the options are admittedly limited - there were only about 4 or 5 Indonesian items on the menu. Most of the menu consisted of sushi, with a random assortment of hibachi style dishes and Thai food.

I tried the soto ayam, siomay, batagor, and basil fried rice. The dishes overall were somewhat bland, and lacked a strong punch that I typically expect from Indonesian food. The mackerel fish cake could have used a lot more flavor, the siomay just tasted very bland a potato-y, but the soto ayam wasn't too bad. The basil fried rice was not too bad, but did not have any stand out flavors to it.

Surprise Stadium is a beautiful venue.  I also appreciated how the stadium was very clean and well maintained.

We arrived at the ballpark probably about two hours before the game was scheduled to start, so parking was easy since we were some of the first fans there.  Parking was free and volunteers directed us on where to park.  We were staying in a hotel in Chandler, so the drive from the hotel to the ballpark was about an hour or so.

We had field level seats in Section 106 which were in the shade.  There's a second deck that's almost entirely in the shade, but there are also plenty of field level seats (the ones closer to home plate) available that are out of the sun if that's what you are looking for.

Although the stadium is nice, the food could really use some major improvement.  The food options are plentiful enough, but the quality of the food is really below par.  During the game, I had a toasted turkey sandwich, fries, a soft pretzel, and a frozen iced tea.  The turkey sandwich wasn't very good, pretty much packaged turkey meat, shredded lettuce, and ranch dressing in between toasted bread.  I've had frozen packaged fries that were better than the fries served here.  The pretzel was decent and the frozen iced tea was good.

The volunteers that work at the stadium were really nice and I got to talk to a couple of them who told me where they were from and why they now live in AZ.

And recently I have been hearing comments regarding their food quality changing for the worse (mostly about their brunch, which for awhile was the hottest brunch in town). 

My friend and I were heading into Noda on Friday for a few drinks. I thought drinking on an empty stomach was probably a bad idea, so we decided to stop in for a quick bite. 

The place was packed, but we were able to get a table immediately (this was at around 8:30pm). Our server (forgot to get his name) was excellent given the busy night. He was upbeat and energetic. It's always nice to have a smiley face server instead of one that acts like he/she hates the job.  

We ordered the chicken bucket, which was the healthiest thing on the menu. It's essentially a fried chicken salad in a sweet and tangy vinaigrette. For $10 it's a lot of salad, plenty to be shared by 2 people (or even more). The Baked Lobster & Scallop Cavatapi dish is a little pricey ($22). 2 baked small lobster tails on top of a sizable casserole of cheesy pasta with bay scallops mixed in, it was amazingly tasty. The sauce was perfect. The lobster tails were the best quality, obviously frozen, but at least you get 2 of them. The only thing I found misleading was the ""seared scallops."" Seared scallops tend to imply sea scallops, but these were the tiny bay scallops, and in my opinion they weren't exactly ""seared."" It's still good nonetheless.

Tickets are pretty cheap, which makes for a great night of entertainment, where you can drink, yell at people and enjoy some hockey.

The coolest thing about Wranglers games is the fact that it brings every hockey fan in Las Vegas together. Go to a game and you'll see a lot of Wranglers jerseys, but you'll see just about every NHL jersey as well. Mom and I enjoy playing the license plate game with jerseys during intermissions. Double points for Penguins fans, of course. More if you get a high five from one. Automatic win if you trip a Flyers fan. Maybe not, but it's a thought if a game really goes sour and we need something else to do.

Right, the Wranglers. I'm not totally sure what the mascot, Duke, is, but he's a cool guy. He runs around the Arena giving high fives to kids, sitting on fans' laps, leading cheers, shooting T-shirt guns and mooning the visiting team. 

Wranglers fans have a number of cheers, most of which include the word ""suck,"" whether it be directed at the visiting team or the referees. They are fun to yell, so I would recommend learning them. 

Quick correction (yes, I went there, Misti--) the LV Wranglers are a pro sports team. They're part of the ECHL, which supports the AHL and the NHL. Unfortunately, that means our players are often signed to other leagues, but that's the price of having good players, right?

Seems reasonable. I came in with a few of my Vegas resident friends for dinner before the night got started. It's just a few miles from the strip on Tropicana. For AYCE, you can pretty much order off the entire menu. Their special rolls were decent, nothing spectacular, still good. I had the salmon and white tuna sushi. It wasn't as fresh as I'd like it to be. Not that it wasn't fresh though. I just prefer it to be slightly colder when I bite into my sushi's. The ahi poke salad appetizer was good. Had a bit of a kick to it. People that enjoy spicy food may like that.

Service was decent. Although, our friends told us that the serve indicated we would receive a sake shot with ordering AYCE after 8pm. Well, we did not receive it. When we had asked the server, she said because it was busy they had to move the time to 9pm. Really? With at least 5 tables still empty and still plenty of chairs available for the bar area, that was busy? I don't think a small order of sake would make any difference in how busy a restaurant is. Because of that, they weren't a favorite in my opinion. We asked for separate checks, 3 bills. The bill for 2 people with gratuity included came out to be $72! They added $11 in gratuity. There was only 5 people dining. I always thought gratuity gets added on for a party of 6 or more, something 8 or more. I definitely wasn't pleased about it.

I got the shrimp tacos with rice & beans. My date got three of the street tacos - asada, pollo, & carnitas with rice & beans. He enjoyed them but said they were not spectacular. The shrimp taco had potential to be really good as it had the well-seasoned shrimp, rice, and sour cream, but there were way too many jalapeños in it. I like food that has a kick but this was almost inedible. I did my best to pick them out and added the beans to tone down the heat.

The Ceasar Salad is placed in a large metal bowl with all the different items and mixed together and then placed in a bowl to be served. 

The Cuban Panini came with a side salad which was just okay. As for the sandwich the meat was sparse and the bread was okay.

Price wise the small salad seemed a little pricy and the sandwich was on the high average end.

I was a little confused on the sushi here as it seemed overly flavored with sauces so the fish doesn't really stand out.

If you're from Calgary, you already know the answer to this question, and since you're on BMO Biz Page, I'm assuming you've got a pretty good hankering. It's... (drum roll please) The BMO Centre!

From competing in mountain bike dirt jump competitions at the Outdoor show in grade 11 to my highschool grad banquet, to the 50+ Living show as my first time on Country 105 to Beer Fest, Comicon and countless others, I've had my chance to see all sides of the BMO Centre from attendee to vendor to... hair model? Seriously.

What Rocks: 
Boasting 5 exhibition halls, It's so easy to navigate for how how deceptively large it is. Most shows will give instructions  like Hall D&E and you're left to figure it out. In the brilliant, timeless words of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, ""DON'T PANIC!"" It's actually easy. You'll find it. There's one main hallway around the outside and more often than not you just wind up where you're supposed to be. If you don't, there are plenty of signs to help you out. It's spacious, clean and well lit. Exactly what you need a large, open venue.

If you're a vendor, there's excellent load in access to the halls allowing you to bring utility vehicles right inside the hall. 

What I do NOT like:
$15 Parking. This city is notorious for terrible parking fees and BMO Centre, you are not helping. This often includes vendors as well. If you can, take the C-Train and get off at Victoria Park/Stampede Station. There's ample parking, but there's a demand for it and they don't mind gouging you.

$1,500/minute WiFi. Maybe I forget the actual number and am making something up, but it's really expensive. If there's something the Stampede Grounds are very good at, it's getting ALL of the monies! Why are we charging everybody for WiFi again? After $15 Parking for a $25 show, I'm not paying you for WiFi, but it would be a very nice perk. If you didn't offer it, WiFi would also help both vendors and attendees get their social media on and get even more people out to the event at the BMO Centre. 

Anyway, just take the train, don't use their WiFi and don't eat the food (oh yah, that.) and it's one heck of a fantastic trade show (and much more) venue.",2014-10-07 04:47:09

The super creamy grits & schreiner's sausage trio was a bit rich for my taste yet worth a try if you like comfort food.

I was impressed by their selection of beer. I'm not a beer-expert, but I feel like most fanatics would enjoy this place. Their specials were good and had lots of interesting choices!

I'm probably being a little generous with a five star review, but I wanted to get your attention. The ambiance does leave a little bit to be desired. I think they are still using the original Taco Bell seating! You order at the counter and food is served to you on a Styrofoam plate on a red plastic tray. You have your choice of chop sticks or plastic utensils. Mister Cook's is all about the food. And I'm fine with that!

I love all the dishes I've tried (so far). The menu is pretty standard Americanized Chinese, with all the usual items included. They do have a ""Diet Menu"" with five choices. And a $7.45 per person dinner special. They have a nice lunch special, served daily 11:00 - 3:00, priced at $5.25 - $6.35, depending on your main dish, served with rice and soup. I started with the Kung Pao Chicken and plan on working my way through the rest of the menu over time.

With this in mind, I recently placed a large order for a party from this Pizza Pit on Monroe, which was the closest one to our venue. Sadly, the pizzas came lukewarm and left much to be desired. 

This may have been because the delivery person couldn't figure out how to walk into the building and so there was about a 10-15 minute delay from the time he first called our phone to the time we received our pizzas. However, the taco pizza looked nothing like the menu picture, bright with toppings. Instead, it was pieces of chicken, cheese, and slightly soggy tortilla chips. The buffalo chicken pizza was also unimpressive, more cheese and chicken, and the macaroni pizza was slightly dry, leaving me longing for Ian's instead. I couldn't bring myself to try the fourth pizza. If I find myself having to order from here again, I guess I'd stick with the basics like pepperoni, and pick it up myself if possible. 

While ordering, customer service on the phone was great, and they were willing to deliver slightly outside of their zone for such a large order. Ragret.

We were the 3rd ones on the list and I was keeping eye out for our name to be called. A gentlemen walks in , leans over host stand whispering something to host and trying to hand him a $20.

Since I was standing pretty much behind him I witnessed this as well as the other guests who were next on the list. 

The host tried to shrug him off because I was eyeing the whole situation but guest was persistent on making this happen and the host did. 

The guest then went to grab the rest of his party and the host sat them down and the guest gave him money. As I watched this happen the host then went back to the stand and I asked him where was his name because I pointed to the other guests who was next and told him they were next. 

He got nervous when I told him I saw him walk in and pretty much give him money to sit them down before everyone else. 

He told me they just came and sat down and he'll fix it and I said no, he gave you money to get them seated and you sat them. 

Anyways, end of story he got them to get up from table and they had to wait like everyone else. Playing dumb like they didn't know what happened and why they had to get up. Other guests who was next was seated and host got removed from front and manager took over.

Great for vegetarians, vegans or anyone with dietary restrictions, who (if you're like me), doesn't want to be ""that guy"" bugging the staff about every ingredient. But also great if you're bad at choices - they have a pre-fixed menu as well.

The fish itself is really fresh and my 8 piece roll was just enough to comfortably fill me without that sushi bloat (you know it). Also try the chicken balls with the spicy mayo dip.

I've always visited Geisha on the weekend before heading out to Old Town and really love coming here on Sunday nights (1/2 price drinks and apps!). They have a DJ every weekend night playing great tunes while you eat yummy sushi and stare at dead rock stars behind the bar. Yep, there are beautiful photos of Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Sid Vicious along with a rock (literally) themed wall and sculpture in the middle of the restaurant.  I really enjoy the sushi here and have never had a bad roll. My absolute favorite drink to get tipsy on is their Kinki Kooler. It consists of Dragonberry vodka, fresh kiwi, and lime juice. So delicious, before you know it you have downed three and started dancing to the music in your chair, yep, you are that person! You're welcome.

Service has always been great, friendly, attentive staff. Once it gets busy it can be hard to find the hostess, but when she does, you get helped right away. There are also private karaoke rooms that one can rent out for an event which all have patios that you can sit at and people watch at night (that is always a good time). I did notice about four TV's inside playing a football game, while there were an additional four outside playing a different game.

The ramen itself is not all that bad. It's not the absolute best I have ever had, but it gets the job done. What really shines here are the sides and the kids meals!

I had a side of the kimchee fried rice, and let me tell you..... It is by far THE BEST I have ever had!!! It's so damn good. Love the pieces of pork belly mixed in. I also have tried the fried noodle side dish, in which you can order it with the thick noodles or the ramen thin noodles, as well as a choice of beef, chicken, or pork (and maybe one other choice. I can't remember). It was a little oily, but still super delish.

My other favorite things to order are the boba tea (AVOCADO, PLEASE) and the honey toast. One weird thing though. The first time I ordered it, the toast was dipped in egg and cooked, like a traditional french toast. The second time, the bread was just toasted, no ""french"" at all. Hmmm. Kinda odd.

 With a quick one-month renovation from the former Colborne Lane space, the high ceiling, exposed brick with wooden theme throughout the space. The space was very inviting especially with the large windows that bring in some natural light. Very elegant and yet has an organic feel to it

 The wine list range from local to imports and are all very reasonably priced form $10-15 a glass and most bottles from $40-75 while some pricier ones like a $380 Tuscan Red is also available. While the beer list are mostly local Canadian microbrews.

Cabernet Sauvignon 2008 Crew (Ontario) $65
We originally wanted to go with a safe one from Tawse that we had before but our server suggested this one saying that it's one of his favorite. I am surprise that he notice that we wanted something local and suggest an Ontario wine to us.
Never heard of this winery before but love the strong robust flavor of this wine with a rather chewy tannis finish. Loved it so much that we are tempted to go to the winery one day.

Yes, I know it's a boring picture of a piece of bread but I just wanted to mention that they made their this sour dough bread in house and it was so good that I think I had at least 3 slices.

  Seared Quebec Foie Gras $19
~ Purple potato puree, lobster mushrooms, bacon crispy confit, Saskatoon Compote
~  I can never resist ordering foie gras each time I see it on the menu and this was no exception. 
~ Not only was it cook perfectly but doesn't it look so pretty with the purple potato puree, the greens on the blank white plate... it's like a piece of art work.

 Venison Carpaccio $16
~ Black Trumpets, Wild Leek, Corn Nuts, Seedlings
~  We were pleasantly surprise at how tender this venison can be, it was perfectly seasoned with the right amount of gaminess to it which was further complimented by the trumpets and the crunchiness of the corn nuts. 
~ Ben is having a really tough time forgetting this =P

The most delicious Mini Hot Dog you can ever have.... perfect crispy casing, perfect flavor, perfect sweet relish and a perfect toasted soft pillowy roll. Thanks Chef for this amazing fun amuse.

Roasted Muscovy Duck Breast $28
~ Tatsoi, shallot, sourdough croutons, crispy confit, dried cherries, duck egg béarnaise
~ This was cook so perfect, just how I like it since I do find it overcook and chewy in a lot of places. 
~ The duck itself was very lightly seasoned which work here so that I can taste the natural duck flavor which was further complimented by the tart cherries and slight mustard-y kick from the tatsoi.

Chicken Cordon Blue $26
~ Prosciutto cotto, monforte paradiso, chicken jus, Jerusalem artichoke, roasted pepper & black olive salad
 ~ Ben was so tempted to order the steak and chose this one instead since chicken tends to take more skills to cook than steak. 
~ This was no disappointment, although being all white chick breast meat it was tender and juicy with a thin crispy outer layer.
~  It was perfect with the intense chicken jus and the olives salad on the side.

 Buckthorn Pavlova $11
~ Buckthorn curd, milk chocolate ganache, black sesame ice cream
 ~ What a cute presentation and thanks for doing this even though I didn't requested it (^_^)
~ Even though it was so pretty and we weren't sure if we should dig in, we eventually did after admiring it for a minute and everything on this dish (except for the candle) was so delicious.

 Raspberry Macaronnade $11
~ Mascarpone mousse, basil ice cream, macaroon, raspberry tuile, texture of raspberry, salted pine nuts
~ The smooth and light mousse was interlace with raspberry coulis was just a beauty in the Manson jar with all the raspberry seeds peeking through.
~ I also love how the use the jar lid to hold the ice cream but presentation aside, the basil ice cream can easily hold it's own ground and need I say extra bonus point from me since I love basil (yes, I love it so much that I can munch on it).
~ This is the perfect summer dessert, light and not overly sweet with a fresh outdoor airy feel to it.


Verdict :
~ Haven't had such a fantastic meal from start to finish for a long time.
~ Great friendly, attentive and knowledgeable service
~ Great tasting and Great presentations
 ~ Great spacious settings, def no listening to next table conversation.
~  I already miss this place and hopefully I will go back soon.",2013-08-01 02:39:11

Our server was very good and we did not want for anything. She took our drink orders quickly and gave us enough time to make up our mind on a very extensive menu.

She enjoyed her Sandwich and proclaimed it to be one of the best she had had. My Shepard Pie was good although I am a traditionalist and prefer lamb. Plenty of beef however and a good savory taste with ample portions.

You see a commerical and then have that awful song in your head and you go buy a $5 foot long.  The only problem is that you end up spending $10 after you add other stuff.  
Go to a Subway and have a custom sandwich built just for you! Cheers!",2011-06-11 19:52:11

I still remember when the owner set up a tiny booth in the winter outside Jtown selling grilled chicken skewers, and he told me he wanted to open a restaurant there. In a few months Izakaya Ju was open and they had a very limited menu with the focus being the Yakitori chicken, but over the years have expanded the menu and real estate to take the adjacent store space too. 

My favourite item is still the Yakitori don which is only available during lunch. The chicken burger is also amazing! Obviously their speciality is the yakitori, but I have tried almost everything on the menu and every dish is consistently good quality with good presentation. They hire all Japanese servers and so the service is great. It may be a little challenging for some people as their English ability isn't the greatest, but they are more than patient. 

Their menu may not be as extensive as some other izakayas, but it is a nice cozy spot with reliable quality and service.",2017-08-03 21:56:34

Following what could be called a ""burger movement"" in Toronto, it seems almost natural to move on to its fast-food counterpart and give it the much-needed makeover. And Craft Dogs does just that. Imagine everything you think you know about hot dogs and throw it out the window.

First off, the hot dogs are hand-crafted and contain only natural ingredients, even the casings. Yup,  ALL-natural. Most, if not all, of the condiments and drinks (less the beer, I presume) are made in-house too. If you love your lemonade like I do, go for the simple yet why-aren't-more-people-doing-this maple syrup version.

Second, the mainstays are crazy! In a good way. Everything from duck to pork belly to kobe beef are dressed to impress. One standout is the Thai dog topped with a mango salsa, but I hear the avocado dog is equally as good.

Finally, do you work in the financial district and tire of the corporate culture trickling down into the restaurant offerings? Escape here and eat well.

Shout out to the owners Kathleen and Brian who, following the success of their now sold Beer Bistro, clearly know what this city craves in food and drink.",2013-05-24 03:27:04

However, we made a special trip to the King's Kitchen today with a group of 10 people (we made reservations).  You probably know that The King's Kitchen is a non-profit restaurant owned by Charlotte chef and minister Jim Noble.  The restaurant began with no debt; it was all paid for which helps them give more back to people.

In a place serving mostly southern style food, I had to get sweet tea, which is not one of my faves.  However, if all sweet tea tasted like this, I'd probably drink it much more often.  We ordered some pimento cheese for an app, which was a decent size scoop but served with only about 5 crackers.  This wasn't a problem when the made-from-scratch biscuits and cornbread came out though.  They tasted great by themselves, but they were also good with the cheese.  I make pimento cheese often, and prefer mine with more of a kick of hot sauce, but this cheese was still very good.  I got the pan-fried all natural chicken with white meat.  The chicken was slightly dry (because white meat often is) but the breading made up for it.  It tasted like they used panko and that stuff is awesome.  The meat comes with three sides for lunch, so I got mac and cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, and fruit.  The sweet potatoes were awesome and so was the mac and cheese.  Everyone ordered a variety of items and everyone really liked what they got (keep in mind more than half of this group are native southerners and two are even native to Charlotte).  The pineapple upside down cake was also moist sweet, and delicious.  

It took a little bit to get our checks, but that's a minor issue.  It's a rare occurrence when a restaurant gets our group's order 100% correct and even rarer when everyone loves their food.",2011-06-17 23:57:11

Now, Vegas doesn't have a perfect pub.  The main problem in our city is that every pub ruins its ambiance by installing those damn video poker machines in the bar.  And part of the greatness of a pub is a spacious wooden bar (uncluttered by anything except empty pints). So in Vegas, we already start a star down (try resting your elbow on the bar with those blocky video poker machines in the way).

But when you lower the bar for Vegas, Crown & Anchor is an excellent choice.  They have a solid selection of British, Irish and American beers and a decent whiskey collection.  Add in a nice dart board and a solid crowd of good-humored patrons.  Head there for a big soccer match or rugby match and you'll find a nice batch of rowdy fans yelling at a television.  It's comfortable and fun, with tasty fried food and drinks.  What you'd expect from a good pub.

And there are some advantages to drinking in a Vegas pub.  Like all successful Vegas businesses, Crown & Anchor has perfected the art of hiring sexy wait staff.

Located in a very small strip plaza on Smith Rd near Brookpark.  When I saw the glowing reviews I thought it was a joke.  This place is very small.  But it's no joke.

When I walk in I am greeted by a gentleman behind a counter with an interesting moustache and a smile.  He is extremely nice and very genuine.  I sat and ate my lunch at one of the 4 tables close to the door (that's all that's in the place).  He knew more than half of the customers that were checking out by name.  Asking how their mom is doing among other personal details.  I could see why because when I checked out he struck up a conversation.  It's hard not to talk with him.  He is very genuine and easy to talk to.

He asked me if it was my first time in.  I said yes.  He told me to go to the counter in the back and they would take care of me.  A much younger version of the moustache gentleman (with a beard) made me a sandwich sampler.  So I know what to try on the menu.  Apparently, that's what they do for first timers.

They are known for the their wraps over bread or hoagies.  And their prize sandwich is the reuben wrap.  They explain that is their baby and what they are most proud of.  They make the corned beef from scratch in house.  With aged house made kraut.  And all the sauces on their sandwiches are house made.  The flavors that are layered in the reuben make it one of the best I've had anywhere.  Tender pita for the wrap.  Tender and flavorful corned beef.  The tangy kraut with a savory crunch.  Mixed in with smooth and tasty 1000 island dressing.  

Their business is based on superior customer service.  Spending extra time and care to get to know their customers.  Spending extra time and care to create some of the best food in a sandwich I've ever had.  It shows.

Easily worth the 5 stars they get here.  Well deserved.  I can't wait to order their catering so I can share this place with others in the area.",2017-12-22 01:31:56

I've definitely had better BBQ in Chinatown proper and Scarborough/Markham. Beware when ordering a ""medium"" or ""large"" sized duck/chicken. They told us the medium was a half a duck and the large was the entire duck, but they were definitely missing some pieces, such as the breast and wing. We figured they used those part for the ""small"" or combo with rice dishes. I don't like the white meat anyway, plus $8 for a half a duck would have been pretty cheap so I wasn't too bothered by it but some of my BBQ afficianado friends were quite offended.

Anyway, my chicken pot pie was good, though took long to come out.  About 40 minutes and it wasn't too busy.  My chicken breast sandwich came out sooner, but I had to send it back because it was not done in the middle.  Fortunately it came back better, and I avoided any possible food sickness.

They've replaced the carpeting with vinyl that looks like wood and feels cheap under your feet. There is a rug in the room, but I wish there were more soft surfaces to walk on after you've kicked off your shoes. The furniture is mostly new and retro. The bathroom hasn't been updated in close to 30 years. Overall, the new room looks better than it used to, and the way the furniture is arranged it makes the room feel bigger. If I had a preference, I'd take the upgrade to the Go room over the Fab, but I wouldn't turn down a Fab room.

The Flamingo seems to be catering to the 2 Broke Girls set - those who want to stay at Planet Hollywood who don't have the funds. Why else would two girls be walking into the hotel on a Friday night, one carrying a bottle of vodka and the other a curling iron. Travel light, ladies. The location remains prime and the prices are fairly reasonable. The food is mostly terrible and expensive. The pool is one of the best in Vegas.

Keep in mind that there's major construction going on both sides of the hotel. At one end, they're turning Bill's into an upscale boutique hotel. On the other, they're building Project Linq and refurbishing the common areas of the Quad (formerly Imperial Palace). That means you want a room in the middle of the property. You definitely don't want to be next to the Quad right now, as that construction site is jackhammering away 24/7. Ask where your room is before you take it, and check in as early as you can to avoid being stuck in a room across from a construction site. Tip: Total Rewards members can use the kiosk while everyone else is stuck standing in line. Go get the card.

We were super tired so we just decided to order some rolls al a carte and take it home. What I liked is the guy recommended for us to get their special combo to get your money's worth, add another roll and save some money, why would I say no.  

The rolls were done pretty quick, they show you the sushi before they bag it, and I liked how they put the sauces on the side.

The restaurant is pretty much the same as any other viet restaurant and mix in the area where it's located makes it even more authentic. 

The restaurant is fairly clean and has enough space to hold a mass amount of people.

Their pho is pretty fresh and the broth is smooth. You don't get that thirsty feeling from the thousand ounces of MSG so that's good. It's not too salty, fatty and too little. The portion size is fair and the price shows it too.

The store is clean and I can always find what I'm looking for here.  I don't go to TJ's for the produce.  It's never all that great looking and very limited.  I like some of the prepackaged produce items though. 

TJ's markets itself as organic or a place where you can find less processed food.  I do like the fact that most of their frozen foods have very few ingrediants and are some of the best frozen foods around.  Their tameles are pretty darn good for frozen tameles.  Their spaghetti sauces are darn good and they are pretty cheap.  I also love their whole wheat sourdough bread.  

I recently read an article that said TJ's was owned by a German company.  Really?  A store that seems so darn American and even has a Hawaiian/surfer vibe to it is owned by a German company??

I also recommend the Dirty Fires. This is essentially a large plate of fries with peppers, jalapeños, and onions along with a special gravy, sweet-like sauce. You also get your choice of 2 dips. It's very heavy so you can definitely share along 2 or 3 people. 

Their ice cream is also pretty good. You can get Duck Fry Bits added on (they're alright, you're not missing out if you don't add).

They have excellent service to go with their quality fish and offer a good variety on their AYCE menu - which will only cost you around $20 for lunch and $22 for dinner.  Can't beat that!

THE MEAT:  We went in for lunch on a Wednesday and were 1 of the only 2 tables there.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and the food came out in good time and pace.  The soft shell crab was light and served with a tasty ponzu sauce.  ""The shit"" (crab and cooked salmon in nori, deep fried and served with yum yum sauce) didn't quite live up to its slang name (I wonder if they chose it for its aesthetic resemblance).  The salmon kama was presented beautifully (as all of their food are)... it is a piece not quite on the collar itself but still very tender.  The monkey brains will please any fusion fan, it surely teased my palette with familiar crab salad mixed with sweet banana tempura.  I wanted to hate it so bad, but got quite the opposite effect.  

And the sushi, my oh my.  The fish to rice ratio is ridunculous!  We loved the salmon, hamachi, super white tuna... and the lasagna roll is good if you like cream cheese.  How they make profit for serving great quality with an extensive AYCE menu for so cheap in a low key neighborhood eludes me.  I do hope they can keep up the exceptional value for your money!  I would totally franchise this spot.  Binge on good sushi with flip flops here or hide in one of the dark corners with an ugly mistress.  GOGOGO!  (P.S. I recommend not bringing the kids unless it was for lunch, or if they are capable of behaving like... college students out for sushi and sake.)

Please note that if you park in the Stanwix Street garage you will be charged $15.00 for event parking. If you move over one block to the 6th St garage across from the Byrum theater then you'll pay the typical weekend $7.00.

The venue is all over the downtown area so we limited ourselves to the artist's market and caught a few musicians here and there. They now have the area between Stanwix St and the street just before the Fort PItt Bridge approach roped off so you can see the weekend artists in that area.

The place is packed as usual. Some of the vendors I have seen from before while others are new and sell everything from paintings to wearable art to jewelry.  Much is expensive but some places are reasonable. You basically pay for what you get.

The Wyndham hotel has a covered area set up for food and drinks provided you stay on their property. All around the festival are set up food stands which include my all time favorite lobster burger as well as lemonade, ice cream and the usual fare.

Once you cross over to Point state park there were more vendors from the market surrounding the area by the bridge underpass. Along this side of Stanwix St is the main food court where the food is overpriced and fair. I bought a lemonade for myself and my daughter and they were just barely cold. What can one expect in this heat?

Gone were sitting areas. You now must bring a blanket since the festival stage is in that same area.

The place is jammed packed with people as is typical the case so it is a bit hard to move from vendor to vendor. Still I find their work interesting and ended up buying my daughter a lithograph.

With all the walking and standing it is just a bit too much for me to see the juried exhibitions but i did manage to get a picture of some art under the portal bridge.

They do offer entertainment at certain times during the day and they do have evening shows.

It's truly worth a visit just to see it and for once we did not have to deal with rain. The festival lasts 10 days only. The artist's market changes constantly so there will be new vendors later on in the week.",2015-06-07 21:56:33

I do think the isles are too narrow.  There's no need for one to feel crowded in a store when only half a dozen people are shopping at one time, but if half of you are in the same isle AND one or two are pushing a cart or stroller, it's a traffic jam.

I got it for 69 dollars a night by using priceline and selecting 5 star strip hotels, this was about 20 dollars less per night than their website price. This was over Thanksgiving a few years ago. Upon checking in I negotiated with the check in person and got upgraded to a larger strip view room for 10 dollars a night and a 20 dollar tip. You still have to pay a resort fee if you book online through another source- but that was like 12 dollars - I'm not sure if the resort fee is covered in their online price.   Since then a few sets of family members have stayed there as well and they all liked it.

There is no casino inside the Trump- so if you want to gamble without leaving your hotel this is not the place for you. While considered ""on the strip"" it is actually about 2 blocks back from Las Vegas Blvd right across a small side street from fashion show mall (if you stay here eat at stripburger for sure). It is about a 5 minute walk from the Wynn. 

The rooms are designed like condos- single open room and bathroom. The room is large, has a king bed, and a small kitchen area with a fridge and stove.

The vibe is definitely trendy, not straight up Japanese, hence the A Go Go I suppose. There's a creative drink menu, including some crafty beers, and the sushi menu is definitely not your Japanese mama's selection. There are teriyaki chicken sliders and a roll topped with fritos. Overall, I think the food gets most of its punch for being creative. I actually couldn't resist ordering a role with grilled chicken, as I wasn't feeling fish, and the overwhelming flavor was of burnt breast. That's what you get for ordering chicken at a sushi spot!

W8qFKImG92bmhXK_EKnZxw,eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,-FtngCwHCD2tRlH8jpj_Ag,3,0,0,1,"I came in to Hash House A Go Go for a late breakfast/early lunch. I ordered a mushroom swiss buger because, well, mushrooms. Rather than fries I ordered my burger with a side salad. 

I wanted Italian dressing which they do not have at Hash House. The server told me the salad comes with cucumber ranch or I could choose one of their other dressings. He listed regular ranch and a vinaigrette and a couple of others I can't remember. I chose the cucumber ranch. I probably should have gone with the vinaigrette. The cucumber ranch sounds refreshing but I really couldn't taste much. The salad had potential with the romaine, green onion and radishes. But the lack of flavor in the dressing and the strange chewy croutons (cornbread?) were a turnoff.

The burger itself was good. The meat reminded me of the camp steaks my mom used to cook when I was a kid. Not sure of that is a good thing but it was familiar. It was a big burger for sure. I actually had a hard time finishing it and I am traditionally a big eater. The burgers here are ""stuffed."" Really it was like having two patties with mushrooms and cheese in between. Then there were the standard burger toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. The big a$$ knife stuck through the middle to keep the burger together was a bit much. I suppose it was meant to be used to cut the burger in half but I don't roll that way. To me, a simple wooden skewer would have sufficed. I also didn't appreciate the giant spring of fresh rosemary stuck in the top bun. I like rosemary as an herb to flavor foods while cooking but used only sparingly. I am of the school of thought that garnishes should be edible. A woody stem of rosemary is not. On the subject of strange garnishes are the twiggy thinks strewn about my plate. It looked like sticks of burnt uncooked spaghetti. What was that all about? If it doesn't serve a purpose, leave it off my plate, thank you.

Hash House A Go Go is a popular place. They have many locations nationwide that all seem to be busy so they must be doing something right in some peoples eyes. For me, it seems over rated and over priced. Yes, you get a lot of food so the prices are probably fair based on portion size. But if you aren't entirely happy with the food, bigger isn't necessarily better. I enjoy the country atmosphere but the industrial metal chairs are terribly uncomfortable. For those of us who are a little wide side-to-side, the back of the chairs wraps around and digs into the waist and hips. I wasn't really able to sit all the way back so sat forward which led to slipping off a bit. One would think that a place that boasts larger portions would have larger patrons. Appropriate seating would be appreciated. Please take no offense to that statement as it is not meant to be disparaging. Just an honest thought I had while squirming and waiting for my meal. Having now tried Hash House, the curiosity is satisfied and the desire is gone. Will I come back? Perhaps. But it will likely be a while.",2017-10-22 18:56:23

Any location I've been to the service has always been friendly, and I like the wide variety of smoothies they offer (even though I pretty much stick to just a couple). I'd probably give most locations 4-stars. 

However, this location easily gets 5 stars because of the customer service. I'm not at all surprised to see another recent 5 star review point out the general manager Jason by name, because he's the one I'm specifically referring to re: the great customer service. 

I've been coming here quite a bit the past few months, and my mom decided to get me a gift card here for Christmas because she knew I'd take advantage of it. Well, when I came in here and tried using it for the first time it didn't work. Jason happened to be working, and gave me my smoothie for free that day. He gave me the phone number to call to see what the issue was and it turned out for whatever reason when my mom bought the gift card the transaction was canceled almost immediately after she purchased it. The customer service rep emailed me the receipt (they were able to look it up using the gift card number).

As a result, my mom technically didn't wind up buying the gift card (but she didn't realize this, obviously). I brought in the copy of the receipt to the store, and I really didn't expect them to do anything since at the end of the day no purchase was actually made (granted, this was due to a mistake on there part). Again, Jason happened to be working and gave me several free smoothie coupons that more than covered the cost of the gift card. 

Honestly, since this is the closest Jamba Juice to my house, and I like the smoothies here I'd continue coming back no matter what, but it doesn't hurt that  the customer service here is so good (by ALL the employees I've met when coming in), and in particular the GM, Jason.",2014-01-25 23:43:06

The prices are pretty darn amazing ($6 for a sandwich and side?  Awesome).  And they have fresh squeezed lemonade, free refills.  My first time here was with my mom and stepdad, and they loved it.  My stepdad hates pretty much every restaurant we go to, and his most frequently said phrase after dinner is ""4/10.""  Black Dog got an ""Eh, I'd come back here,"" which is a ringing endorsement from him.

In addition they have a nice selection of beers on draft at all times.  The first time I went here, my boyfriend got the sampler and it had 4 pale ales, which I was a little disappointed in (though they were pretty good).  However, they rotate in 6 new beers every week or so (I'm guessing) so it's worth coming back frequently.  I was there just the other day and got a Left Hand Milk Stout, which happens to be one of my favorites.  So smooth, so good.",2010-08-18 23:54:53

They have everything crafts you could ever need and also a custom framing section. I paint so I get all my acrylics, brushes, mod podges and polyurethane (glossy spray) here. Although they lock up the glossy spray, when you want it they have to unlock it and the girl will take it to the register and by the time you get to the register you forget and the cashier doesn't know it was yours so you leave without what you went there for and then you either go to Walmart where they don't lock up the glossy spray or order on Amazon. So, for most basic items this is a great store. If you can find Michael's coupons they really help you can end up walking out of here paying $50 for craft stuff if you're not careful. They have coupons all the time for 20% off just google them :) And Michael's it time to go with the times: people don't lock up the spray anymore, only you :) thanks!",2017-11-17 20:00:51

Nadege is a popular brand when it comes to desserts, when they decided to open a store literally right underneath my office, I had no excuse not to try.  Since then, I came here probably on 5 different occasions already.

Service is great here, they are friendly, attentive and can always provide you with great recommendations when you are struggling to see what you want from the large selections of cakes, croissants, chocolates and macarons!  I tried their cakes, macarons and lattes here so far and I am very satisfy with the quality.

For cakes, I tried the Praline, Pur Noir and C3 and I personally prefer the Praline because of the wonderful hazelnuts taste!  The Pur Noir is also very decent, the chocolate was very rich and not too sweet.

For macarons, I tired pretty much most of their flavours.  Chocolate, Mojito, Matcha, Rose, Cotton Candy and Cappuccino.  My personal favourite so far is the Mojito and Rose.  I did hear the Salted Caramel is also good, so I will for sure try it out next time!  Latte here is also very smooth and I do enjoy a cup everytime I'm there.

Just a warning, the desserts here are not cheap, but if you want some legit desserts after a long day at work, this is a perfect way to cheer yourself up (just don't think about how much you paid for the desserts!!).  Or if you want to pick up a small gift for a friend or colleague, this will be a good option too because they have beautiful packaging for both the cakes and macarons.",2015-04-25 22:29:56

I had their Egg Baguette Panini.  I had mine with the eggs, turkey, spinach, mushrooms, and their tomato basil sauce.  This panini comes with Swiss cheese, but opted to have it taken out.  At first bite, I thought that the bread was the highlight.  Their breads are freshly made in front of you if you're lucky like me, then you get to the substance, which is the turkey and egg.  My goodness...I loved my meal.  I chased my panini with a cup of their chowder.  This was so good too.  Dining inside looks to be a little tough during lunch time since the restaurant is small and the outside seating is minimal.

-Friends had the pastrami sliders, buffalo burger and inside out French onion grilled cheese... all of which looked amazing.... and they said it was too.

Service was spot-on.  They were there when we needed them as if they knew somehow.  Otherwise, they left us alone to enjoy each other's company and the music.

Tried to make reservations the day before for 6:00pm, thinking it would be no problem for an early weeknight dinner.  Wrong!  The earliest reservation they had available was 8:15pm.  We decied to show up early and take our chances at the first-come tables in the bar or patio.  We got there about 20 minutes after the place opened, and there was already a 90 minute wait for a table.  Wow!  Anyway, the hostesses were very nice and accomodating.  They had the perfect solution for us, which was to order some drinks and snacks from the bar, and hang out at one of the unserved tables in the back until we could get a table in the dining area, which ended up taking only about an hour.  

We had a round of 1/2 price margaritas and Tecate to start since it was happy hour.  We also got an order of the pineapple-jicama-mint guacamole.  Everything was so good, we decided to go for another round before dinner.  This time we got 2 margarita samplers (3 flavors of 1/2 size margaritas. Love it!).  We tried the spicy mango, pineapple, guava, hibiscus flower, strawberry-mint, and pa-bango.  I had no idea what pa-bango was, but it tasted a lot like the guava.  It was a different color though, so I don't think they just gave us two of the same.  My favorite was the hibiscus flower, but they were all good.  We also ordred the queso fundido app without the chorizo.  It was tasty, but a little watery.  Would have definitely been better with the chorizo, but then we couldn't  have shared it with our vegetarian dining companion.

For dinner, I had the smoked trout and crab chilaquiles, which would have earned Momocho 5 stars even if everything else had been dreadful.  It was that good.  Definitely in the top 10 meals of my life.

My husband had the pork chop, which he said was just ok (probably because he tasted how awesome mine was and was disappointed he didn't get the same thing).  Our friend had the vegetarian taquitos with beets and spinach, which she said were good, and also a good alternative to the typical vegetarian options she usually sees.  Nothing that we ordered was particularly spicy, so if you're worried about spice these are all good choices.

A trip to Momocho definitely requires patience, or at least pre-planning, as it's very popular and not very big.  It was well worth the wait for us, and both the drinks and the food are deserving of a repeat visit.",2012-06-22 13:46:09

I came here once in the summer and it was lovely sitting on their outdoor ""patio"" area which is tucked in a little alleyway. Service was pretty decent as well, they were knowledgeable and good about answering questions, of which we had many.

For starters, we ordered the nodini (warm bread knots, olive oil, rosemary, garlic) and the orrechio di maiale (crispy pig's ears). A number of Yelp reviews I read talked about how delicious the nodini was, and I thought it was pretty tasty, well-seasoned bread, but end of the day it was just... bread. I enjoyed the crispy pig's ears more, which were also well-seasoned and felt kind of like eating chips and were just as addictive.

For mains, I ordered the bigoli (duck egg pasta) and my two friends got some kind of clam pasta and the vitello da latte (milk poached veal tenderloin.) First off, I really really enjoyed my pasta - there was a good balance of savoury and sweet flavours, the sauce was very creamy (probably because of the mascarpone), and the noodles were tougher than what is typical, but not in an unpleasant way; in fact, I actually quite enjoyed the texture of the noodles.

The clam pasta wasn't bad, although my friend did comment that the flavour was kind of unexpected for her... not exactly the traditional clammy/seafood flavour you normally find... maybe they used a different kind of sauce? The veal tenderloin, however, was such a standout dish, it was soooooo so soft and tender. To the point where my friend called it ""euphoric."" 

While absolutely delicious, the portions really were not that big, so we found ourselves sharing two desserts to end off our meal - tiramisu and a pork blood chocolate tart. One of Buca's big things apparently is that they use unconventional and (for some) slightly frightening ingredients in their dishes, like pork blood, horse eye, lamb's brain, etc. The pork blood didn't really add any special flavour to the tart, but maybe changed the texture a little so that it seemed more gelatinous? Overall nothing to fear though. There were some nuts sprinkled on top, and the tart was very rich... something chocolate-lovers would enjoy. From what I remember of the tiramisu (clearly wasn't that memorable), it was good but I think didn't have enough bread/biscuit in it and was too liquid-y for my liking.

Drinks-wise, they have some decent cocktails, mine wasn't memorable but my friend got one that had olive oil in it which made the texture super smooth and she loved it.

My first experience here was fabulous, and I would love to come back to try other menu items. Again, I just wish their portions were bigger because a) they're delicious and b) I'm a growing woman with a healthy appetite, so Buca will definitely be more of a ""treat yo'self"" thing for me rather than a regular dining spot.",2015-11-12 22:04:50

It's never a good thing when you order the grilled wings and they come out a minute later, not just our order, but the gentleman next to us. They were cold, chewy and not impressive. No carrots and celery, as they had run out the night before.  I get this might happen when you just open a restaurant.

The first time I was here for a friends birthday party few years ago. I was so busy socializing I did not pay much attention to the food. This time we were on a quest to find a new restaurant for lunch/dinner. I realized I was here once as soon as I walked in. 

Hostess was very friendly. They let us choose wherever we prefer to seat. I love all the tall windows that give the restaurant good lighting. Very relaxing and welcoming at the same time. 

We ordered garlic knots as our appetizer. If u plan on kissing anyone tonight, this dish is probably not for you. It is covered with garlic and we love it. For the main entree, my friend ordered a pizza and they actually use shiitake mushroom on it. So delicious! As for me, I ordered bolognese with meat sauce. I didnt like the type of pasta they used and they were kind enough to use spaghetti and recook for whole meal for us without asking. I cannot be more grateful. 

As for dessert, we took a cheese cake and tiramisu to go. I think the Tiramisu is a bit too sweet for my taste but my friend loves the cheese cakes. Overall I think this is a wonderful Italian restaurant and would love to come back here again.",2015-07-12 22:52:53

In an effort to avoid restaurant craziness in Uptown during CIAA weekend, we decided this South Park area would be absolutely perfect for dinner out this past Saturday night. Plus, the night got kicked off to an amazing start as our Uber driver changed the voice navigation voice to that of Morgan Freeman....that combined with the amazing food was a Saturday night perfection!

We made reservations for 6:30 on Saturday. When we arrived, the place was fairly busy already (aka. Make reservations!). We were seated at a slightly odd table, see comments below for more info, but they did have some neat looking half circular booths that seemed super romantic and cozy!

Upon looking at the drink menu, we decided to go with a bottle of a French Chianti. The Sommelier was excellent and extremely knowledgeable. Our wine comfort zone is typically California and some areas of Italy; however, this bottle was absolutely excellent and made me want to venture into French wines a bit more often!

As we were looking at the menu, we were brought out some sourdough bread and butter. This bread was soooo tasty! We decided to start with the Fiery Mussels (based on the recommendation from some awesome fellow Yelpers!) with the french fries. The fiery mussel portion was ginormous!!! I mean, this was easily enough for our meal! The sauce was incredible.....the winning combo was dipping the bread in the sauce. Yes, the second basket of bread really was necessary! Completely messy and so totally delicious! The french fries were really good as well. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. While writing this, I am wondering to myself why I didn't dip the fries in the mussel sauce! Even though we were completely full, we also decided to order the escargot. The order came with 6 in this awesome garlic butter sauce. So glad we pushed on through the fullness to get the escargot cause they were super tasty!

The meal was absolutely fantastic and this easily would have been a 5 star review if it weren't for service. We were put at this weird corner table that probably should have never been in existence. My chair was kicked somewhere around 8 times during the night (I actually stopped counting) simply cause the table was awkward and stuck out. I literally got hit in the head twice with the big sheet paper that goes on top of the table when one of the waiters walked by to clean off some of the tables nearby. Having big sheets of paper hit you in the head (twice) provided my husband with entertainment, so that's a plus! I'm working on the assumption he didn't notice either time cause he didn't stop or anything. Our waiter was in a bit of a daze the whole night and seemed like he wasn't having one of the best of days (completely understandable, as we are all human). I guess, I have just heard amazing things about this restaurant and was a bit disappointed at the service level, which is something so controllable. 

Absolutely outstanding meal! We will definitely be returning (hello, bottomless mussels on Tuesdays!) but will just request a different table next time.",2016-02-29 16:47:34

The decor is similar to the McGill location. I love it! It so zen and romantic...especially now with the Christmas lights outside the building. 

I arrived at 6:50pm and there was a 5 a 7 spécial which meant $5 cocktails! So worth it! I ordered two right away. I ordered one cocktail with gin and berries and another with Canadian Club and cucumber. The first was fruity and sweet. The second was light and refreshing. Both were good but you couldn't really taste the alcohol. I think a lot of ladies would like it. I feel like both would make for very nice summer drinks. I later ordered the miso cocktail with sake and pineapple miso but I didn't like that one at all. I switched to Blanche beer after that. 

So I only ordered the gnocchi. It was good but the plate was small. I should have ordered an entree as well. That's my bad. I thought eating pasta would be filling enough. There was half a lemon that I squeezed all over the pasta. The gnocchi was with pesto, Parmesan, basil and arugula. The size of each gnocchi was big for gnocchi but I just wish there had been more gnocchi on my plate. My friend gave me a kombucha battered onion ring and it was the best onion ring I ever had! They were humongous and so crunchy! With the aioli it was even more delicious! You don't taste the kombucha. I also tried a bite of my friend's vegetarian burger. It was just ok. Nothing special. I would not order it. The fries were solid though!! 

Considering we were a group of approx 15 people I have to say the service was good! The waitress kept asking if everything was ok which I really appreciated. When I went to the McGill location I remember the service was terrible and I was only with two other people! 

On a side note, I have to add that there were some inconsistencies with the menu. They had a special  with the burger or banh mi which came with either beer, wine OR kombucha as stated on the French menu but on the English menu it said beer, wine AND kombucha so it was a bit misleading. For sure it was meant to be OR because otherwise it would have been too good to be true but still my friend got excited at the thought of getting wine beer and kombucha when he read the English menu lol

That thing is MUCH more than a sampler.

Their salsa is great, and there're few things I love more than a good salsa.  Again, their flautas come with a cheese sauce that I could eat by the spoonful.  Their shrimp bisque also serves as a delicious chip accompaniment.  The Queso Flameado (on the appetizer menu) with chicken, shrimp, or both rules my life.

And Kathy H here has since visited quite a lot of bars in Toronto! (and other cities! not Markham, my home, as they don't have any bars... not really)

Firstly
- kangaroo, bison, boar, pheasant, elk sausages
- chorizo, ocktoberfest, italian sausages
- the cheapest is the $6 all beef/bacon sausage called ""Danger Dog""
There's more on the menu. just as an FYI I've had all of these above ;) so you're right, I have been returning here. A lot.

I've had them served on a bun, like a hot-dog, I usually go with onions and/or peppers (two free toppings)
and I've had the sausages cut up into bite-sized pieces and drenched in tomato curry sauce (currywvrst)

I can die here.

Fries are delicious with the duck-fat. Sometimes they put too little, sometimes soaked. Dirty Duck version is peppers, jalapeños and onions with lots of WVRST specialty sauce. This is tasty, and I'd order if you think fries are a little boring. It's sort of like a deluxe WVRST-style poutine (without cheese, without gravy).

""Small"" is actually a generous portion of fries. One person eats a Small (without sausage) and can get full.

Dipping sauces are made in-house, comes free with your order. Or +$1 to add another. Chipotle has always been my favourite. The fries plus currywvrst are also surprisingly delicious. Sweet Chili is nice too. Never really liked the Wasabi Miso.

Beer selection is fantastic!! I love the German wheat beer, second last on the LEFT menu. Whatever that is. I can never pronounce it right.

Meat like that is way too tender to be overdone, and we all ordered it either rare or medium, in turn we all received medium-well and well done. It was the most chewy and stiff meat I have ever eaten. The only thing tolerable on that plate was the fries --another aspect saving this rating from being a 1-star.

Meh. I've experienced WAY better (sorrynotsorry).",2014-03-27 22:53:17

Sure, it may have been a special occasion that the owner was aware of. Sure, I may have been sitting with a man with connections, who knew the owner personally. But, don't hold that against me. Luck of the draw, I tell ya. 

I had heard great things about this place, yet had been surprised that I had never heard of this place - until it was time to have a group birthday dinner. What a way to celebrate! 

Wine, appetizers, entrees, champagne, dessert... It's no wonder somebody didn't have to roll me out afterward. I sampled the calamari and prosciutto/melon apps. Both were very good, although the latter was a bit too salty for me. The bread in the bread basket was good - great way to curb the appetite before ordering - but nothing compared the the herb butter. HOLY CRAP! I don't think I've ever met a butter I fell instantly in love with - well, not until I dined at Tutti Santi, that is. 

I ordered the special - orange roughy stuffed with eggplant, mushrooms and probably some kind of cheese. Regardless, it was very good. The creamy sauce was heavenly, too, and I really don't like cream sauces. It came with a side of pasta that was seasoned very well. You didn't need to dip it into anything. It was great as a stand-alone side to the special. 

I wasn't the only one who enjoyed my entree. Everyone at the table seemed to gobble up their food. I was the last to finish. Maybe I'm a slow eater? I don't know. 

Then came dessert - tiramisu, cannoli, cheesecake. My god! Plus, the owner celebrated our birthdays with a bottle of champagne. So good. Surprisingly, I wasn't overly stuffed to where I felt sick. I probably should have been, but after moving all day, I was sure hungry! 

I definitely recommend Tutti Santi for a special occasion, whether it's with a loved one, a birthday party or a family event. You can't go wrong here. As for the atmosphere, it's warm, inviting, cozy - with dim lighting and the soft sway of conversation. If nothing else, there's sure alot of pictures and things on the wall to keep your attention - that is if you're not too busy stuffing your face.",2008-02-04 17:02:28

I have been taking my vehicles there for the past 12 years, actually just picked my ""truck"" up today. I drive my cars into the ground. Literally, I do not have a the cash to just weed through new cars, or replace old ones... I put huge miles on my vehicles...

It started with a 1980/1 Chrysler LeBaron, Petri, the car that couldn't fly... The guys at the shop managed to help keep that thing running for as long as it ran. From oil changes, belts, tune ups, anything and everything Petri needed, he got (Thanks Dad ;)). I would go hang out because I had to have my car the minute it was ready. Which meant for certain repairs, it was ready the same day. Now, mind you, that was a loooooong time ago and I wouldn't recommend just hanging out, especially not in the summer, just wait for them to call and they will... Reuniting with your car will feel so good. HA! It's the truth, because every time I have gotten my car back, it's been great, seriously.  

Then it was, the '89 golf... I hated that thing, and it hated me. Massive spillage of some sort, pouring everywhere out of my engine, late one night in west phoenix. Well, Ron and the guys magically fixed that, stupid thing ran for a long while after that too I'm sure, until I decided I'd had enough and upgraded to a 1993 LeBaron, Sally. Man that thing was fast. Anyway, I know for a fact they serviced that vehicle for me as well. 

Now, I'm on to a faceless X-terra without a name... I say faceless because it's missing a front end. I want to try to repair that with my son, so I haven't inquired about it at Richards... I just picked it up for a new catalytic convertor, and shocks both of which were desperately needed. Emissions coming around and whatnot, even better, Ron had mentioned it to me some time last year that I would be needing one, I think when I went in for a stud/screw/whatever its called, that Discount Tire couldn't remove when I went in for a tire repair. 

However, I will say this, over the past decade and four cars that I have owned, I don't trust anyone else to touch my ride. I must admit that I haven't been anywhere else to see if there is a 'bargain', but, I know the dealership charged more for oil changes than at the shop. My knowledge of reliable, honest mechanics is that its a special trade that one must be skilled to do appropriately and honestly. Well, that's these guys, and they do a kick butt job at it! I have always heard people talking about how difficult it is to find a good mechanic, well, I must have gotten lucky to begin with because I've never had a complaint. 

Tell your friends, take your car in for your next oil change just to check them out, I'd call ahead of time though, just as a heads up, or you can probably just stop by and say hi to them they're super friendly.

As for the guard dog... Well, you'll have to check that out for yourself.

I'm a for life customer, and would proudly claim them as my mechanic for any car repair needs, any day!",2013-03-07 05:57:56

I've been here several times in the past, and though I'm a NYC pizza kind of guy, something about the burnt thin crust, sauce and toppings really appeal to me. I took an out of town guest here Wednesday night. We were seated almost immediately.

We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and sausage, a small order of meatballs and ricotta, and a couple of iced teas. I still don't get the ""only bottled soft drinks here"" thing. Why no fountain drinks - you have beer taps? C'mon.

Anyway, there was a couple with a small child seated on the other side of the restaurant from us and the little Beelzabub had a scream somewhere between Jamie Lee Curtis and nails on chalkboard. And it was near constant. The parents just talked and laughed, and would give the kids things to play with, which she would immediately deposit on the floor. I didn't want to complain to them or the wait staff, but you'd think they would say something to the couple. Or that the couple would, heaven forbid, parent. But it went on for a bit, disturbing everyone in the restaurant. Such is life I guess - finally they left of their own accord. I'm all for family friendly, but doesn't a Tazmanian Devil fall under the category of pets?

First our meatballs arrived, and they were delicious, with a small dollop of ricotta and sauce. Then our pizza came, with the same delicious burnt crust, good quality crumbled sausage and fresh mushrooms. Can not complain about the food, though it seems many here have. To those who complain about the pizza being well done - CAN YOU NOT READ THE SIGNS POSTED EVERYWHERE IN THE RESTAURANT?

It was then that I noticed that the restaurant seating area was totally devoid of wait staff. They were all congregated behind the service counter in two small groups, giggling away and in discussion. This wouldn't normally bother me (though it might have bothered the other diners who were waiting for service), but our waitress was doubling as the bartender AND was in her own intense conversation with a guy at the end of the bar. She had placed the check on our table about 5 minutes before, and I immediately put down my credit card. She was much too absorbed in conversation to notice much of anything. After about another 10 minutes I gave my check and credit card to another wait person who happened to finally walk by (and who was none to happy that I violated protocol), and she took it immediately to our waitress/bartender. Finally! But of course her conversation with bar anchor wasn't finished, and we had to wait at least ANOTHER 5 minutes until I finally got the receipt to sign.

So, to sum it all up, food top notch, service EXTREMELY spotty.",2014-08-22 17:08:17

I've been in a few times since my last review and just now decided to update my review. DAMN I LOVE THIS PLACE! There review updated. Really though every time I go in service is great and the food is consistent. I've have tried other places and none have matched up to the food or service here. Don't just take my word for it look at the other reviews. They are so good they had to get a sign saying when the meat is gone cause they sell out yes they will run out of meats cause they don't mass produce large quantities and though it in the fridge or freezer. This is probably why the meats always taste great and always consistent.,2017-05-21 02:17:42

It's another sub shop, where you enter and order at a counter while they make it for you, then grab your finished sandwich and pay all at the front. They have a big board behind the counter showcasing all of their different items. This location has a daily special (at least during the weekdays) which is a regular sandwich and a drink for like $7. You can add on chips for an additional dollar. I went for the special which was tuna since it was a Friday. 

They have different types of bread (white, wheat, sourdough and something with cheese), but I just stuck with classic white. They added mayo, lettuce, onion, tomatoes and pickles to the sandwich and I was pretty into it! It had good flavor and was a decent size. If I had the choice I would definitely come here before subway, just in comparison. It felt like their ingredients were better quality than the slimy stuff you get at other places. 

The store was clean and the staff were nice. I saw other reviews that spoke about employees and the owner/manager sitting at tables by the register and I did notice this, however it didn't really bother me. Just a disclaimer if you're someone who doesn't like that.",2018-03-09 20:05:19

- poke was also very delicious 
- the avocado tuna tar tar was a little bland (not pictured)
- the spicy salmon sushi was very fresh and not overwhelming with all the toppings

Environment - our table had fish swimming it (it's kind of cruel but I guess was meant to fit the aesthetic of getting the 'bigger' table) -- other than that it was dim lit but made to match the intimate atmosphere of sharing food and hanging out with friends

Take this at face value: I prefer Kingyo over Guu/Kinka overall. I love the energetic atmosphere that Guu has, but in terms of food quality I liked Kingyo over Guu.

There seemed to be a heavy Power Rangers theme in Kingyo, and it showed via many of the decorations, in addition to an actual Power Rangers clip behind the sushi chefs' table. Even the washrooms in the basement had some Power Rangers decorations, in addition to very traditional Japanese music.

Anyway, on to the food...my family ordered tako wasabi, garlic tuna tataki and ponzu jelly, Kingyo legendary chicken wings, stone grilled kobe beef, grilled black cod, aburi toro, aburi shime saba, and frozen matcha creme brulée.

Personally I enjoyed almost every one of these foods in different ways! The tako wasabi was unique, as you're given both a raw and cooked option (or both). I went with a mix option, as I've never had cooked tako wasabi before. It honestly tastes just as good! The garlic tuna tataki was seared nicely and the ponzu jelly had a very unique taste to it. The chicken wings were also juicy and delicious, and I can definitely see where the ""legendary"" aspect came from. The stone grilled kobe beef wins for uniqueness; you're literally grilling beef on a stone! The black cod was also very good (why is that not in the everyday menu?) and the frozen matcha creme brulée was one of the best I've had in an izakaya joint.

This leaves behind the aburi toro and aburi shime saba...I liked the aburi toro, however the rice fell apart too easily for my liking. Considering that was the most expensive dish of my meal, I had to dock some marks off. Finally, the aburi shime saba was too fishy for my liking, and I didn't notice anywhere where the mackerel was torched.

Service was great; the servers were very knowledgeable about their products and consistently made sure we had enough water and the fact all our food has arrived.

Overall I definitely enjoyed my visit, considering it was my birthday dinner. I like how there are other izakaya restaurants in Toronto that I can choose aside from Guu, and this place definitely is up there in my favourite izakaya places I've visited in the city!",2015-11-11 23:15:11

It's the next best thing to being in Tijuana eating barbecued iguana. (I can't swear there isn't an iguana taco -- have another 'rita and go take a look, 'kay?)

It's a ""scene"" restaurant, as most things on Mill Avenue are, so not the thing if you're feeling incapable of coping with sudden, loud noises, many of them made by inebriated undergraduates. If you go at a dead-ish time of day, it's not in-your-face loud. The staff are perky and patient while you figure out the menu for the first time, and they don't go nuts over trying to turn tables if there isn't a crowd. This is counter service -- order up front, pick up the food in the back when called -- so it's pretty low key.

The breakfast tacos are pleasant, more than life-changing. If you have a serious problem with fairly well-done scrambled eggs, ask up front to have them runnier or order something else, as these are quite well-done eggs. In the future, I would stick to variations where there's something greasy like chorizo to counter the stiffness of the eggs. These tacos are very generous -- I thought I was starving and couldn't finish a plate of two with the accompanying Latin potatoes (which are very nice) and refried beans (which are generic).

As far as Mexican restaurants of this sort -- silly name, self-conciously funky decor, waitresses in tight shirts, very large drinks, loud music, okay food -- go, this is a bargain with a nice view of the neighborhood.",2014-03-31 00:25:28

The hot dogs are pretty good. If you look at the pictures, it's primarily hot dogs. The french frie servings are huge (but not Oakland O huge). Pizza is good. I'd recommends staying aware from the other options. I haven't been impressed with the hoagies and wings.

As a note, be careful with some of the bottles. I've had some old ones on occasion when I've picked some of the odder selections. That being said, this would be my pick for a bottle bar.

The tartare was definitely my favorite, as it had a slight smokiness that married well with the vinaigrette and pickled veggies served with it.

The mac n cheese was creamy with hints of several cheeses blended together. Although bacon and I have a troubled history, I felt the risk was worth it as it wasn't overcooked nor did it overpower the dish.

I've tried similar concepts in Honolulu and Seattle and Cafe Sanuki is comparable.  We went for the soft opening and our meal was on the house.  We tried the carbonara udon and the curry udon by default (they ran out of the beef and tofu options). The texture of the noodles was spot on, not mushy like some other places that serve packaged udon.  The carbonara was creamy and flavorful. My 2 year old especially liked this udon.  Nothing special stood out for the curry udon, it's decent curry but not amazing.  I'm glad they did the soft opening so they can work out kinks like running out of certain dishes and organization of order numbers.  I also tried the mini garlic pork belly bowl.  The pork belly is cut thin and was a nice savory flavor with just the right amount of salt for me.  We also tried the tempura shrimp and fish cake.

this better work since i want to be the FIRST to review something in canada :)

did you know that montreal is a bachelor party haven...not bachelorette party, but bachelor.  don't ask me why...and i don't want to know either :)  

like any chain hotel, this sofitel is just a standard hotel with a restaurant, bar, exercise facility, in-room massage service and other amenities catered to tourists and business travelers.  it's a minimalistic modern place located pretty much within walking distance to many attractions but away from noisy bars and nightlife scenes.  the room was adequate in size and for the price we paid, but i prefer something more classy and ornate.  the concierge desk was very helpful when we inquired about tour options although you could get a better deal in chinatown just a few blocks down the street.

It should be at the prices customers are being charged.  Is it insanely good?  Do my eyes roll to the back of my head when I take a bite?  The simple answer is no.  The reason is simple.  The food isn't unique.  It's good and very much like every other high end French restaurant I've been to.  

The formula goes like this:

- Lots of art, mirrors, white linen tablecloths, silverware changed every five minutes, 14 different people serving you, etc, etc
- Menu written in French with short English translations underneath.  Usually you haven't heard of either the preparation style or the ingredients
- Foie gras is always heavily involved (yes, I'm a sucker for anything foie gras related)
- Many courses
- Many very small courses
- Lots o' butter (albeit very good butter)
- The appetizers and the mains are very good (seared foie gras!,  white (because green is just too ordinary) asparagus with a tangy sauce, and four tiny bites of rib eye, which was very nicely aged, but it was missing that rib eye fat sizzle)
- Desserts are off the hook (the souffle, oh my!)

The only thing unique about Joel Robuchon's is the amazing sweetscart.  And by amazing, I'm talking forty different kinds of candied deliciousness!

When I came in I noticed this place was decorated pretty well. I had made an appointment earlier in the day. When I approached the front desk I noticed the girl behind the counter wasn't that interested. I told her my name and instead of checking the appointment book she half heartedly asked if I had an appointment. I was then told to go pick out a color but wasn't told where that was. After a half ass answer of, ""It's in the back"" I wander through the first room to finally discover the backroom with a table of nail polish. 

I only stood there for a minute before I was taken to the pedicure chair. I repeated several times that I like the water really hot, but gave up when it seemed like she either didn't understand or didn't care. I handed the girl my polishes (I do two colors plus glitter/sparkle on top) and explained what I wanted. She seemed to understand and I can say she was friendly. I sat back to enjoy my pedicure. 

Being a runner, hiker, weightlifter, and all around athletic person, my feet tend to get a working. I explained that nothing word hurt so please just make sure to get them good and smooth. I had to keep insisting and she kept going back but with little effort. She never got NEAR the amount of skin off that my regular place gets but I get tired of repeating myself and gave up. After a fairly useless massage (sorry, I'd rather have my feet soft then someone rub my calves) we move over to her table to do the manicure. 

When I sat down I quickly realized she didn't bring all the polish. I had to ask several times and explain again how I wanted my nails painted. It was actually rather annoying and stressful as I knew if that combination got broken up or we just couldn't find them then my nails would be messed up and mismatched. Luckily she was able to scavenge them back from someone who did take them

I finally got done and out of there. Within a few days the polish was already chipping. This doesn't typically happen as I work a desk job so I could tell she didn't either put enough coats on or a good top coat. 

All in all I wasn't completely disappointed and won't go back. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was that the interior is nice and the girl was friendly. Go elsewhere.",2015-05-05 10:06:02

It is usually not a word with positive connotations.  However, upon visiting the Communal Mule located on the Dundas West Strip - I now have something positive to recall.

Came to the Communal Mule as it was the only coffee shop that seemed to be open in this neck of the woods around 5PM.  All the other ones (e.g. Ella's Uncle, Ezras Pound) were all closed.  We were looking for a place to hang out until the restaurants opened at around 6PM.  This strip of town is dead between the hours of 5-6PM as literally nothing is open (at least from the food/hospitality side of things).

The Communal Mule is a quaint coffee shop with operating room lights overhanging some of the tables, and rustic looking art made of wood adorning the walls.

I ordered a Cappuccino while my DC ordered an Americano and we decided to share a Dulce de Leche cookie to tide us over until dinner time.The Cappuccino was quite good as it had a rich coffee flavour to it.  Even though I got mine made with skim milk, it was still quite creamy and satisfying... almost like drinking the real thing!

The Americano was a bit disappointing as it tasted like a watered down coffee.  The Dulce de Leche cookie was made with shredded coconut and was a rather dense cookie.  It was surprisingly just the right amount of sweetness without making you feel like running off to see your dentist for cavities.

Verdict:

We rang out at around $9 for the 3 items we ordered which is pretty reasonable for a non-chain coffee shop.  The barista was very friendly and witty.  The Commuanl Mule is a cool place to grab a coffee and there is even seating by the window in case you feel like people-watching.  I would definitely come back again.",2011-05-09 15:00:30

The first visit was for brunch. We arrived right at 9AM for brunch on Saturday and the staff acted surprised to see us, which is funny because their website says Weekend Brunch 9AM-1PM.  We were seated and a server was rounded up for us. We enjoyed the cinnamon rolls for the table and as we were a larger group, enjoyed pretty much one of each thing on the brunch menu. It was all tasty but the service was clumsy because I guess they forgot that they serve brunch. Other patrons came in during that time so it wasn't like they were just accommodating us. 

The next time we came, I brought my kids for brunch. My littlest doesn't care for biscuits so I asked if we could replace his biscuit for toast instead. The server said sure but then tried to charge me for the toast on my bill. We had to practically beg for refills and our food was cold. Our server seemed very put out when we sent the food back but I refuse to eat cold eggs and I shouldn't have to be made to feel like I'm inconveniencing someone in the process. 

The third time we came was for dinner. Another time of begging for refills. I had the Autumn salad and husband had the Royale with Cheese. The salad was tasty but the burger had to be sent back twice. Just because he likes it well done doesn't mean it should be a hockey puck. The server was attentive and apologetic but even he didn't seem to get what well done meant. 

The servers don't seem to be trained properly and seem confused when you ask for something outside of what's precisely written on the menu listing. The restaurant itself is kinda dirty. Twice I've noticed food jammed into the booth creases and the bathrooms are dusty. The food tastes good but as I've said in previous reviews, dining out is the about all 3 elements-service, ambiance, and food. 2 of those 3 elements are just meh here.

The building isn't that new,  but that's just one of the reasons I like the place, it has some of it's own character.  It's small inside, but there was plenty of seating.  

We got a lamb dish and a vegetarian dish because I heard good reviews on Yelp about the lentils (patting myself on the back for good advance reconnoitering!).   The waitress was thoughtful enough to check if there was a problem with mixing the meat and veggies, which to me is no problem but good thinking in the event a vegan and a normal person were eating together ;).

Food was all very good tasting and the injera (spongy leavened soda-ish flatbread) was more than enough, now if only Indian restaurants could be this generous with their Naan!  The honey wine is always a must, although I saw a bottle in the window that was of Armenian provenance which would be slightly disappointing if that is the only one available.

Other reviews claimed the dishes were spicy, but even our pepper based sauce wasn't all that spicy --- non-spicy options are also available if needed.  With all the injera I ate, I left feeling quite full, but the entrees were a little bit smaller than I had expected considering the $10-13 cost.  I would hope that the honey wine is of East African origin, however it still tasted good and is a worthy substitute if that is the only one readily available.

First for the pros. I had the 2 piece white Broaster Chicken combo. It was excellent! I have never had Broaster and was curious. The skin was ever so lightly breaded and seasoned and extremely crispy, the meat inside moist and juicy. Chicken could not have been any better. It came with 2 potato wedges and a choice of a side. I choose pasta salad. It was above average with a sun dried tomato and olive dressing, my only complaint was I like my pasta cooked just a tad more. Potato wedges were average Jojo type taters that you can find at the deli where hot foods are usually served. A great price too, $6.25 for the combo.  Our son had the kids spaghetti with the addition of 2 meatballs for a dollar more. Looked like average tomato sauce, but the presentation was 5 star. He said it was good and he ate it, so no complaints from me. Meal came with cheesy garlic bread and a small drink. With a $6.25 price tag it was a bargain and could easily have feed an average adult.

Now for the con!  My husbands #7 The Best of everything was clearly going to be a disappointment just by looking at it. It had about 3 slices of meat, a few half slices of red onion, a tablespoon of shredded lettuce and 2 pepperoncini's (he did ask for no tomato). He said it was the worst sandwich ever and the lack of fresh lettuce made it worse. For $10 we expected alot more and could have gotten 2 foot long sandwiches at Subway with double meat for about $.75 more. It did come with side, he had chips. The best part of his meal.

If this review was based on the sub it would have gotten 1 star but the chicken and great priced kids meal was this dining experience saving grace. Online ordering was breeze and the food was ready at the time promised.",2016-09-24 00:47:01

The service was average at best, wait time was much slower than it should be.  The champagne arrived warm and it took over 20 minutes for it to get to an acceptable chill.  I had to ask the waiter to please bring more ice since when we complained that it was warm and they didn't respond.

We shared the foie gras and it was extremely small for $20 and the toast served with it was so heavily drenched in butter it overpowered the taste.  We had to ask for plain bread instead.  We then had the salmon entree and a side order of the mac n cheese.  Very nice flavor and we left feeling satisfied.

However, around 5 hours later, we both started experiencing stomach cramps and diarrhea.  This went on all night long.  I wasn't happy about spending $180 for dinner and getting sick, so the next morning I called to tell management our experience.  I wasn't sure what to, but I thought they should know.  She spoke to me very courteously, but basically said, ' they checked all their food for expiration, and no one else complained"".  This reaction annoyed me.  I feel at the very least an apology was in order and perhaps offer of something on our next visit, anything!  This is very poor customer service and I will not return there again.  There are too many places for fine dinning here, i don't have to patronize an establishment that is not concerned about my comfort or satisfaction.",2013-07-02 23:23:15

Plus, the serving is smaller.
Last time I was there, they had a choice of hot sauces out to top your order, not anymore, now you have to buy a bottle, they are $7.95 each.
In the same area, there used to be napkins, now there are none, I had to ask for some from behind the counter.

My girlfriend ordered the taco's, they were cold (I know we should have asked them to heat them up, but it was enough work just getting the nachos the old way).

In my last review, I mentioned that next to try was the soup.
Like the nachos, there is no longer a choice of toppings, you get just what the menu states. 
This does not entice me to try the soup at all, I really liked the idea of choosing what I wanted in my soup.

2gu1TZmKUk0ZKUhNdReetQ,9bcFzhy96znoZGpZnjChJw,kVqj5hrjUnoDV6nb6oRFbg,3,13,5,6,"This is a bit of a weighted average review.  Let me explain.

Over the 10 years I've lived in Calgary, I've been here twice. Once for dinner, which really didn't blow me away. In fact, it really disappointed me as my party of 6 or so all found the steaks and such to be pretty sub-standard to say the least. As this was a time before I was a Yelper, let alone a Yelp Elite, I really didn't say or write much more than... ""meh, had better"". This experience would be a 2 star at best.

But recently, I tried out the Sunday Brunch for the first time. Now here's something to actually write about. 

It wasn't a huge buffet brunch, but there was a decent selection of salads, hot foods, breads, desserts and such. No seafood to speak of, but then it's not necessarily a hard and fast rule in buffet brunches that there had to be.

You see, on top of the usual choose your own omelette station (which is then delivered to your table...nice touch) and that the beverages were part of the price (thank heavens, I HATE paying an extra $3 for coffee at a buffet brunch), there was the surprise of having an all you can eat all you can eat top sirloin steak offer thrown in with the whole thing. Needless to say, 2x 3oz. medium rare steaks later, I was IN.

The food overall was average to above average depending on the item, but then people rarely go to a buffet expecting 4-star cuisine. But as an experience and value overall (very family friendly too), this was a winner. I wouldn't mind going back again and again over the next few years, though I was pretty damn full after that Sunday Brunch.

Soooo... I would give that experience about a 3.5 to 3.75.  Add the 2 together and divide, you get more or less a 2.75 rating, which would round up to 3. 

Sooo.. Thanks Sunday Brunch for redeeming Nick's in my eyes!",2013-12-21 02:03:52

I think they're a perfect fit between the relaxed clothing at Old Navy and the formality of Banana Republic. Plus, I like that I can usually get great deals here, even if it is a little bit out of my way. 

On my most recent trip here, I came to get a button-up shirt or two for the workplace. Plus, I brought my mom along to pick out stuff as her birthday present. All the shirts I was looking at were the same price as the stuff at the regular Gap I go to (Charleston/Rampart). That was kinda strange, I thought, but I know that sometimes that happens with these places. At the same time, I found some shorts and shirts that were substantially cheaper here than they are at the regular Gap. That made my trip better, plus my mom found some cheap stuff, too. On one occasion, I came in here to find belts, and I walked out with a really nice-looking sweater for $3. Yeah. Three dollars. It's the best deal ever. 

I've never had a problem with the staff here, though today they were kinda jerks about the fact that they were out of bags. I understand things like that can happen, and it's a non-issue most of the time -- until the girl at the checkout decides to stuff shirts, shorts, pants, a sweater, some ladies shirts, and socks into a bag the size of a shoe box. I don't know how she did it, and I'm actually kind of impressed that she was able to do that, but come on. Also, they're kinda jerks about returning stuff.

Additionally, I'm certain a diner (by genre) suggests everything is buttery and greasy in the best way. Unfortunately, my toast wasn't.

I however had a bad experience when eating here the last time that I feel you need to know about.

We ordered the special they had at the time where you get Fajitas and a Margarita for $9.99. When it came time to pay the check the server said she needed one of our Stations Reward Cards for the discounted price of $9.99 (without your card you don't get it at that price) and I happened to have mine handy so I gave it to her along with $45 to pay for the meal and asked for the change. I looked at my receipt when I got home and noticed she used my stations card to pay for the meal with point from my card and not the cash which leads me to believe she pocketed the cash. She did bring change back but said it was $7 and I had told her to keep that for her tip. I wish I would have payed attention to the receipt then and there but I just didn't and trusted her and what she said.
I called the Reward Center and told them about hat happened and that I wanted the points put back on my card that this was absolutely unacceptable. She agreed and assured me someone from Food and Beverage would be contacting me.
Well, after 3 phone calls and 2 e-mails I cannot get anybody to respond to this complaint. I even went in person to Cabo and they said that person was off and they would have them contact me.

Last year, my house was starting to be invaded by all sorts of pests. From black widows in my garage to scorpions coming in the house. I tried the spray stuff sold at Home Depot, only to have a relentless attack follow. It was scary to think I might slip on my shoes and find a scorpion in there.

It was easy to set an appointment to have a technician come out and do the initial spray of the house, going so far as to take precaution since I have a dog. My package also included sticky pads which live in the garage which helped ENORMOUSLY containing all the roaches and other pests that would otherwise try and break into the house.

SUPER easy to spot at night. If you are coming in from Spring Mountain, its the huge brightly lit Shrimp at the end of the plaza. XD 

Decor - very interesting, unique design. they have particular tastes, that may be quite different from others XD 

After hearing about their hot pot combo AND their skewers... THATS GOTTA BE what we will try ! 

Lamb Sticks - $5.95 for 8 skewers - We tried the spicy and the medium. Spicy was first. Meat was kind of small. Flavor wise, DELICIOUS ! Spicy and flavorful. Cumin, pepper, and i believe lemon grass as well? Yummy ! Priced good too ! Medium level was actually a bit disappointing. It was quite the huge gap in spice level between medium and spicy. You can call the spicy, on a scale of 1-10, maybe an 8. Medium, 3-4. It wasn't spicy. It was actually sweet to me. Doriee had called it teriyaki lamb. XD 

Beef Sticks - $4.95 for 8 skewers - Spicy level as well. Same seasoning as the lamb skewers. Was a little awkward because usually the cumin spice is used for lamb. Was still good. Spicy like the spicy lamb too. Meat amount was more than then lamb. 

Hot Pot Combo - $11.95 for 20 sticks with up to 4 different items - We had ordered shrimp, fried tofu, king oyster mushroom, and beef tendon balls. 

Shrimp - Cooked perfectly. Kind of flavorless. Some people had called this place the sichuan hot n juicy. No where near it. None of the sauce stuck. Even peeling the shell and dipping back into sauce didnt help. The Hot Pot ""soup"" is too thin for that application. 

King Oyster Mushroom - Good texture as this mushroom known to be. Slides OFF the skewer very easily... so you'll have to go caveman spear pokin for it later or just use two skewers and go chopsticks style. 

Beef Tendon Balls - Cut into maybe 1/8 slivers ? Holds the soup flavor pretty well. Seemed to have nicely absorbed into the slivers. 

Fried Tofu - Lol. I had called this ""the item to screw thy self with""... Fried tofu tends to be VERY porous and is KNOWN to soak up ANYTHING you put it in thats liquid. Spicy hot pot soup and a sponge of a tofu? Yep... XD Holds a LOT of soup in each piece. Tends to dribble down your chin too so be CAREFUL to not get it on yourself and be VERY careful cuz it will ""explode"" when you bite into it :P 

Overall, the lamb skewers were delicious. Beef was ok. Hot pot combo, im pretty sure the soup base is the same one i use for hot pot at home ... Lol flavor was VERY VERY similar... XD Not bad overall. would come back for the lamb skewers alone.",2014-03-10 05:38:17

not too busy on a Tuesday, so we got our drinks quickly, and also got to, you know, actually hear the musicians playing.

I'm glad we decided to take his advice on Eddie V's, cause I had one of the best evenings of great live Jazz in the Phoenix area sitting right at the bar. After some encouragement by our group, the musicians decided to really lay into it with their music and turn it up from the typical elevator music to something you could really dance along to.

I read the menu online and it sounded good but in actuality it was just okay.  I ordered an omelet which spinach, sautéed spinach was used which had too much liquid that should have been drained better prior to use other than that it was okay.  I had prime rib well-done but there was some confusion about ordering it which was cleared up after 10-15 minutes.  When I received the prime rib, it was too fatty and I had to do a lot of cutting to get to the meat.  The meat was tender but needed more seasoning.

The buffet had desserts but they were not as good as I expected they would be such as the coconut macaroons and bread pudding.  The flavors were not well developed so the taste fell flat; I could not bring myself to touch another dessert.  The bacon was plentiful and good.  I love salad and had a Caesar salad that was drenched with dressing and the leaves were wilted and the croutons were awful.  Mussels and steam shrimp was offered, they would have been great with a little seasoning without it they were bland.  

In addition to the buffet, a few tapas (small) plates were available to order.  I ordered beignets and received three miniature ones served with a fruit compote which were okay.  The restaurants uses multiple servers per table.  Later, I ordered more beignets from a different served and was told as a small plate only one beignet is placed on the plate but how many do I want.  I looked at him for a moment and had to hold my tongue because clearly he does not understand the meaning of tapas.  I simply responded three beignets is fine.  When I received the order, it was worse than the first.  It was drained of color and oily.  I lost my appetite and asked for the check.

I liked that a terrace was available for outdoor seating which is where I sat and loved every moment of it.  The women's restroom was great, the stalls were spacious, the sink had motion detector so I did not have to touch a handle and plenty of soap and napkins were available.  It's a shame that the terrace and restroom were the highlight of dining at Georges Brasserie.

We try to fit a ""sibling"" meal in at least monthly to catch up; trying out the latest spot @ South Point was a great idea. I'm trying desperately here not to hold it up against my favorite neighborhood Sushi-Ya, because it is a fusion/Hawai'i style location. Never having been to Island Sushi put me at a loss as to what to expect. 

Speaking of lost, holy heck, this place might as well be in CA. The car park was INSANE. I was cursing like a sailor on the phone with SM trying to find a spot for 15+ minutes. Do yourself a favor & go to Self Park. 

Normally, I'd be sitting at the sushi bar, but SM & Anthony procured a table in dining room to right. Kind of glad because the sushi bar area was open to Casino and it was packed Friday night. It is brand spanking new, which showed in decor and some service hiccups (they ran out of menus? So our server had to take away the one we wanted to keep: no biggie, but since we order family style, we might have ordered more with a chance to really peruse it as we munched and gabbed)

We had the Eggplant ""fries"" deceptively light for a deep fried item and the batter was airy, like tempura. We also shared the Ahi Poke Tacos (x2 orders) which were very good, with high quality tuna, guacamole and creme fraiche. The Hamachi Sashimi with jalapeño over truffle oil & yuzu was indulgent. We turned at least 4 over zealous bussers away because we wanted to keep that oil for the House Sashimi Sampler and the Salmon Carpaccio. I did not taste the Dynamite Mussels, but I'm picky about mussels. The fish was fresh enough, cut and presented well. It just wasn't that ""flown in last night, killed in front of you"" quality I've become accustomed to. We all really enjoyed the salmon skin salad: on a bed of super fresh micro greens with a light delicious dressing. The only ding was that the slices of salmon skin were very inconsistent in their cuts, with most being on the thin side. 

There were choices for any palate on the menu, so carnivores, ramen lovers, local Ono style and bowl folks alike should walk away satisfied. My Belvedere with a side of soda (I'm super picky and usually mix it myself: former bartender problems) was only $6. You read that right. So clearly, marking up premium vodka is not an issue here! 

In all, this is a great spot to grab ""Asian"" food in this part of town. On a funny note: I was lost and asked SP employee where the new restaurant was and rolled my eyes when she said ""Oh, the Asian place..."" and very kindly pointed me there. Then I walk up and see a giant honking sign proclaiming ""Asian Restaurant"" so I was getting all non politically correct riled up over nada. 3.5 stars rounded up because it shows promise. And ALL of these delicious dishes were just 30$ each+ tip (split 3 ways which is our style) extremely affordable!

The food didn't really blow me away. The best thing I ate were the Pastor Tacos (the asada was a bit tough and dry). The homemade hot sauces do kick butt! The Burrito with ground beef was just okay.

The portion was very generous and if I remember correctly only cost about $4.85 (so you can't complain too much when your belly is full).

Things I don't like:
Service is never what you'd call 'brisk'
The place could use a bit of a scrub
Patrons can be surly on game nights.
But what do ya want? It's a pub, right?

The perfect place to end a long evening on a warm spring night.",2010-02-23 22:16:33

My wife and I were looking for perogies. Pierogi Euro Kitchen has a wonderful array of perogies, potato pancakes and other dishes from Europe and Russia. We had the potato and cheddar perogies pan fried. They come with onions, sour cream and bacon on the side. The potato pancakes comes with apple sauce and sour cream on the side. Both were excellent. Your meal starts with Hollie Bread  and a small salad which were both tasty. This is comfort food at its finest. Thank you fellow Yelper's for this gem of a restaurant.",2017-03-25 05:42:14

Well, last weekend, my roomie and I were reducing our book collection and decided to take 2 Trader Joe bags of books into Bookmans so someone else could reuse them.  We dropped them off at the front and then browsed the store while they figure out our exchange rate... cool right?  Well... kinda.  The problem was that, even though a lot of our books were cool travel books and fiction reads, they said they only wanted  2 books from both of our very full bags!  Then they ask if we wanted to donate the rest.  We said sure but, I might go back in later to see if our books were really donated to a cause or if they were donated to the Bookmans cause.  Seems weird that they only wanted 2 books out of about 20 books.  That was a $7 credit.  

Oh, and I'd recommend going to exchange on a weekday, not Sat or Sun.  They were way busy in the exchange dept. and then we put the books we'd picked out down and left because they had a HUGE check-out line and only 1 register going.  Really?  

This was my first experience and I think it ruined me.  In general the store was well organized, has a lot of variety of books and other media, has a cafe and, has comfy chairs to rest in... but I'm not sure I'll ever be back, even to use the credit.  So... I guess we 'donated' all of our books, which is fine so long as they're actually donated.

I heard a lot about 121 in the past, but I never purchased a pass because I thought it was too expensive. I believe regular membership is about $60/month + initiation fees. Yikes! As a starving medical student, this was just too much for me. But! I recently found out that the student membership costs only $39. Okay, not too bad I guess? HOWEVER, if you're a graduate student, it's only $29/month with the membership fee charged onto your tuition! SCORE! 
Other Yelpers have complained that their equipments are outdated and old. I didn't find this a problem because the equipments are very clean and easy to use! 
What I love the most about 121 are the classes! The instructors are super helpful and always introduce multiple variations of movements to accommodate the different levels of students! Some of my favorite classes are Zumba, cardio muscle, muscle conditioning, and yoga flow. There are multiple instructors for each class, and each of them have their own style of teaching, so you kind of have to attend different sessions to feel out which style you like the best! The class schedule is available on their website. It accommodates to your work/school schedule, with classes at 6am, noon, and after 4:30pm! 
And did I mention there's FREE parking in Veale? Free for 3 hours on weekdays and 4 hours on weekends! Just make sure you get it validated by the front desk before or after your work out! :)",2014-05-22 18:15:56

We were lucky to get some seating because this place was hopping. Didn't have to wait too long and the hostess were attentive and prompt. 

I read through the menu and I got excited. I already started to plan what I was going to have the next time I come back to this place.

I ordered the buttermilk half fried chicken with fries and homemade lemonade iced tea and the wife had mushroom melt french toast with home fries. The lemonade iced tea was refreshing and really good which made me excited again. Maybe too excited to wait but a-waiting we did. The food took some time to come out and can tell why the place was so busy.

When it finally came out, it looked spectacular. Normally I try to eat healthy and a rule is to have some colour in a dish. Maybe some veggies or salad on the side. This was all brown and I was liking it. Overall the food was cooked well. The seasoning (salt and pepper) was too much for me. It was like eating a bag of chips and I needed a gallon if water to get that salty taste out of my mouth. It was the same for my wife's dish.

I came with some friends on a Saturday evening around 7pm, and let me just say BAD timing.  The place was packed and we had to wait almost an hour to get seated (there were 5 in our group).  There are 2 bars and we were able to grab beers and chat while we were waiting, but it was so packed there wasn't a whole lot of room for us even in the bar area.

After we were finally seated our food was served to us by a frustrated little man.  He seemed agitated and he wasn't very pleasant.  I had the signature tacos, one with beer battered white fish and the other was beer battered shrimp just to make sure I got my fill of fried goodness.  I ordered the jalapeno and cheese mashers (mashed potatoes topped with shredded cheese and chopped jalapenos from a jar) which I thought were pretty tasty.  My tacos were decent but seemed to be lacking flavor, maybe needed more sauce of some sort.  They seemed dry and I nearly choked on the lettuce and tortilla shell because it felt like eating paper.

Parking is extremely limited especially on a busy weekend night.  The prices are decent and they had a fairly good selection of beer on tap.  Overall this would be a great place to stop in for lunch but I definitely won't be back for dinner.",2011-01-30 04:40:15

BBQ and Whiskey -  Hayden Block picked the two best things on the planet, two things that Calgary wasn't even unfamiliar with, and then they taught us that we had no idea what we were missing. Where have you been my whole life?

*Smoke.*
Through a quick conversation with Calgary yelper, MJ L., she told me that she's been looking for a BBQ place that doesn't ""hide their meat under the mop"" or in a way that I wouldn't immediately understand - bury it in BBQ sauce. For me, Hayden block is that kind of BBQ. I ordered the pulled pork. Each of the meats clock in at around $10 - $12 for a half pound and are served on a tray, in a pile along with some pickles and whatever side you happened to order. In this case I wen with the broccoli salad which showed up in a cute, red and white checker print paper tray next to the half pound pie of pork. While they've got three spectacular BBQ sauces in the middle of the table, House BBQ, Spicy Vinegar, and Espresso, I found that the meat was so deliciously complex on its own that I didn't want to mask it's wood smoke flavours with any kind of sauce, no matter how good. What kind of mind games are you playing with me, Hayden Block? You give me BBQ sauces unlike anything I've ever set my tongue upon, and then you give me BBQ so good I don't even want to touch it. You're messing with my emotions and you know it!

*Whiskey*
I think Calgary finally has a whiskey bar! There are others in town, sure, but I haven't seen any menus that have really encouraged me to dive in and drink straight whiskey that I've never tried in the same way that Hayden Block's does. They have whiskies from around the globe, listed by country but all on the same page. I like this because it makes it really easy to globe trot in the way of whiskey (or whiskey). Canada was fun, let's head on south to the states, time to hop across the pond to Scotland and then all the way out east to see what the Japanese have been up to. I stuck to cocktails this time around, but I'm really looking forward to going on a world whiskey tour. With a 1/2 price whiskey happy hour, how could you not?

*Sides*
They've got communal seating which makes for a social atmosphere. See a group of two sitting at a table for six? Just go on over, introduce yourself and take a seat.

TVs - There's a lot of them. Seriously Calgary, can we please get over the need to have a line of giant TVs lined up next to each other playing the same damn thing? How awesome your bar is is not directly proportionate to the number of TVs you have. It's not impressive, can we please knock this off? I understand full well at this time of year it doesn't matter if you're a sports bar or not, the NHL playoffs have to be on - but does having whatever random news channel on mute really add to anyone's social whiskey drink experience? Maybe when there's nothing of importance on, these could be utilized for something cool that adds to the experience.

The cocktails were damn exceptional... Most of the time. There's so many bartenders back there, and being new, there's still some serious inconsistencies. Order it once  and it's bold, whiskey forward with a big punch of spicy pepper. Order it a second time and it's mild, sweet, and even comes with a sugar rim. I'm sure it was the same ingredients, but these were two very different drinks. I hope this get worked out over the upcoming months, because Hayden block has the potential to be a quality cocktail bar to boot.",2016-06-11 03:40:43

Considering the meal was over two hours long I had plenty of time to type while I waited. If I could give them zero stars I would. 

SERVICE: The service here is quite horrible.  Aside from Gerry the bartender who is working his butt off the other staff seemed quite lazy, especially the hostesses.  They are also not friendly or pleasant. There were two hostesses, and neither was doing anything. When we arrived I had to wait several minutes for someone to arrive at the podiums.  Then I checked in a party of 2 on a Sunday at 1240 we were told a 40 minute wait.  There were no less than 8 open tables at that time. Many were not cleared of dishes and sat that way through our entire wait.  The hostesses just stand around and chat with each other. Not helping out with clearing tables or keeping track of the empty tables.   We inquired if it was customary to leave open tables unseated with such a long wait list. The hostess initially got attitude and asked if we meant the one table by the hostess stand. When we pointed out the abundance of other tables sitting unused she gave some BS reason about not overwhelming the waitstaff.  Then proceeded to seat parties in the tables that we had pointed out were empty.  So much for not overwhelming the waitstaff.  Meanwhile a table opened up in the bar so we took it.  From here there's an even better birds eye view of all the open tables.  Even through all of this, the bartender is steadily getting hammered and doing his best, and the two hostesses are not lifting a finger to help him out at all. One waitress has come by to help him out occasionally, and if he sees someone idle he will delegate tasks, but this poor man is working his butt off and those hostesses aren't doing a thing. Not even their own jobs. They are also incapable of changing the tv channel in the bar.  Instead they asked the overworked bartender.  Apparently using a remote is also too advanced for them. 

HYGEINE: Tables were left cluttered with dirty dishes for very long periods of time. Like 20-30 minutes at a time. The rag used to wipe the tables down looked really gross and not cleaned. More importantly, people in the kitchen were handling food without gloves.  Touching utensils, tickets that servers wrote on, then food. With the same bare hand.  Disgusting. Waiters transferred muffins and other food items with bare hands. 

FOOD: We ordered before 1:30. Watched people stand around in the kitchen and not move any food. Someone's order of chicken and waffles literally sat in the window for 15 minutes before it went out. I watched and counted. Food finally arrived at 208. The food was cold, as we figured it would be given the high level of dysfunction.  It was mediocre. Not great. Banana nut bread pancakes are a hoax.  The difference in flavor was imperceptible.  Corned beef hash was greasy and flavorless.  Everything was under salted. Scrambled eggs were cold and runny. 

MANAGEMENT:  Clearly, It seemed as though there wasn't any. Turns out there were at least two.  We saw someone else complaining to one, but we ended up speaking with another after our conversation he said he would comp our meal, still somehow we ended up with a bill for $13. Apparently complimentary doesn't mean the same thing all the time? 


Finally left over two hours later, needless to say we will not be returning, and I will be posting this on every social media platform possible.

6kzUrfxHtKn1KL67Khgf1w,ACwN3HGetqPVhAgGKzdnsA,miCnPJ3lYHwU2kcvqzs7jg,4,4,0,0,"So I joined this new gym after trying a few of their crack-o-dawn 'BodyPump' classes.. which really kicked my butt and showed me that I need to greatly increase my training since I've been away from Ryan, my former trainer and gotten weak.

I ended up going to 3 BodyPump classes in a week - score!  I am back on the wagon! 

The place is not perfect (duh), most notably these few observations:
1) treadmills need a good scrubbing.. they collect a lot of debris and I have yet to see staff work as diligently as TRC staff did to keep their machines spic & span clean
2) the wet wipes for cleaning off equipment are POINTless because they are dry and not wet in any way
3) not a lot of room in the main gym area for jump-rope, etc.
4) you have to sign a 1yr contract unless you do personal training (which I did) and then you can do 1-3 mo at a time

The good points:
-They have a TON of classes and they are bust-your-ass difficult
-There are a lot of treadmills/bikes/stairmasters/ellipticals and weight stations that I've never had to wait for someone else or be in someone's way
-LOTS of TVs and each cardio equipment has its own TV with the entire cable spectrum available (TRC only had like 15 or so channels)
-The personal trainer I've had so far is attentive, tough with me and corrects my posture as well as gives me solid eating and working out guidelines like my old trainer used to give me

The young man working there wouldn't have been more courteous and the service was fast.  The restaurant was clean which is absolutely essential to me.   We had pizza that was already prepared and ready to go.  I can't say it was the best in the world.  I don't know that maybe it was a type that didn't appeal to me.  It didn't look like it had been prepared and waiting for to long.  I said I wanted a basic pizza so the young man did his best to help me get what I wanted.  I did notice they offer five types and mentioned to Norma that we might try the thin crust nest time?

Now the good news.  While my friend Norma and I were sitting there, a large Italian looking man had a very large pizza delivered to his table.  It was a deep dish cheese pizza that made me salivate just looking at it.  Obviously this has to be one of there specialty pizzas and we missed the boat by not knowing to order it.   We certainly will next time!

They offered something I am not used to seeing-chocolate chip cheesecake.  Norma said it was good.

One thing I did appreciate about Rosati's.    They had two large screen TV's set to sports channels.  The volume was set to a level that a normal person could enjoy it!  How nice to be able to watch the game and be able to discuss it without having to scream to be heard.

I am really looking forward to going back for that deep dish pizza!",2012-01-15 04:46:49

It is like a delicious octopus bruschetta. We went with the Forager as our pizza option. Lordy, was it a good choice. The dough is charred and chewy - similar to Neapolitan style.

After biting into this masterpiece, I was regretting the decision to order the small plates, as I would have loved to try another of the pizza creations.

- mini fridge in the room was great! kept our vodka ice cold! :P
- burger joint: flamingo's all night diner had a great deal - the burger deal or whatever, but basically a burger and fries for only $2! cant beat that

cons:
- room cleanliness: the carpet in the room looked like the floor of a frat house; stains everywhere - even in the closet! ... i was also unsettled by the beginnings of mildew on the shower curtain
- check in: i wasnt expecting the long line at the check in counter at 1am on a friday. i had to wait an HOUR in line just to check in. i didnt understand it considering it only took me about ten mins when i got to the counter

would i stay here again? probably not. i came on the recommendation from a friend that the renovated rooms were very nice, and im sure they are, but if you get stuck in the older wing of the hotel, dont expect anything! its only slightly better than a motel. so not worth the amount of money i paid ($240 for two nights!)",2010-07-27 06:19:42

Last night, I really needed some sort of recovery food, and ""Asian"" was on my mind.

Yes, this place is a chain, but who cares. If it's good, why not go. I'm Elite, not a pretentious moron. 

I placed my order to go from their Web site. The site is pretty easy to navigate and each item has a corresponding picture. The best part, was you could customize each dish without having to call and tell them. For example, I wanted each of my dishes, ""spicy"". This is the way on-line ordering should be.

Then, I drove up to the location, and noticed there was a separate entrance for Pick Up orders. FANTASTIC! 

By the time I got to the counter, my food was ready, and packed neatly so that none of the sauces would spill. When I asked for chili and soy sauces, I got TONS. Also have a bunch of chopsticks now. Great job here. A+

The food itself was fantastic. It wasn't like home-made, but then again, I wasn't looking for home-made. We split the Thai Dynamite Chicken (large chunks of chicken, delicious basil, no vegetables sadly), and the Chicken Japanese Chile Ramen (very spicy, delicious and perfect). 

Each dish is portioned for one person, so if you want ""a la carte"" or ""family"" style, tell them ahead of time so they can separate the rice or noodles for you.

I can't wait to come back and dine in. The restaurant was a cafe and ""Fast Casual"" style. Clean, simple menu.

I thought it a perfect time to visit friend Anthony Duca's baby, Daddy Duke's in Avondale.  (Truth be told, I've promised Anthony I'd try his family's cooking years ago when his son-in-law used to own the Philadelphia Sandwich Co. in Old Town Scottsdale.  Anthony himself used to own and run Mancini's in Phoenix before selling it and opening DD.  This is the first time I was able to live up to my promise.)  

I walked into the clean, uncluttered restaurant around 4:45p.  I was surprised to see Tony there, along with his wife Mary and Tony's father, who is visiting from New Jersey.  I instantly felt at home in this space that could easily fit 100+ patrons.  As to why, I really cannot say.  The look and the vibe just took me back to the days of family dining in CA and all of the eastern states I lived in.  My server was friendly and helpful as I tried to get a few food issues cleared away.  I already knew I'd order cheesesteak, but I also wanted to try the sweet potato fries here.  [I needed to find out if they were of the same version sold at the PSC, bec. I did not like the ones I tried there.  When Mary said that DD serves pancake syrup with their fries here, I knew to stay away (PSC serves its fries w/ syrup, too.)]  I was also torn between silencing my cheesesteak craving or ordering the special this evening, which was penne with prosciutto and peas with a garlic butter sauce.  In the end, I wished I'd tried the pasta.  

The 10' cheesesteak I chose was steak, provolone, and grilled onions in a roll.  The bread had a nice crust on the outside and was soft on the inside.  Since I'm a fan of crusty bread, I'll have to ask them to carve out some of the soft bread next time, since it really was too much bread for me.  The meat and the fried onions were good, but the cheese was lacking, and when Mary asked me if I was enjoying the sandwich, I told her it was just ""ok"" since it needed more cheese.  As I opened up the other half of the roll to show her, she asked ""Well, where's the cheese?""  She immediately corrected the oversight, and the sandwich was a little tastier after that.  I wasn't going to order anything for dessert since I'd planned to go to Angel Sweet in Chandler for some gelato, but the dessert sign on the table exclaimed ""Cannoli, Pumpkin roll, Cheesecake, Eat me!,"" so I had asked if the cannolis and the pumpkin roll contained **.  The baker reported yes on both, but no allergens in the pumpkin cheesecake.  ""Oh, alright, I'll have the pumpkin cheesecake.""  Am I glad I did, for this was the highlight of the meal!  If you're a pumpkin cheesecake lover, you must try DD's version.  You won't be sorry!

So three stars only for the cheesesteak and the overall service- clean, uncluttered space; clean restroom; and inviting atmosphere.  My original server had to leave early, and my other server didn't come to check as often as the first; otherwise, I may have rated an extra star for the service alone (it irked me a little that, after fruitlessly waiting for my server to pick up my check and credit card, I had to walk over to the register to pay for my meal myself- don't know if this is standard practice here).  The extra star was for the awesome cheesecake- the pumpkin and cream cheese filling was so light and tasted exquisite with the graham cracker crust.  The light dusting of cinnamon was just perfect!  I'd drive 17 miles one-way just to eat another slice.

BTW, plan on visiting for dinner around the same time (5'ish), as the parking lot started to fill up by the time I left (around 5:30p).

p.s.  I will have to try the sweet potato fries next time I visit DD's.  I think weeks' old oil may have been the culprit at PSC (dirty-looking, soggy fries tasted very greasy- inedible, I thought).",2008-11-15 06:46:03

This is an interesting, funky, steampunk restaurant by celebrity chef Rick Moonen. It is quite different that what I would have expected, especially at Mandalay Bay.

Happy hour is from 5-7PM daily. Their specials include select cocktails, wines, and appetizers.

Drinks are well made and they are served with a complimentary bowl of tortilla chips and salsa. 

The CHICKEN POT PIE NUGGETS are delicious, but skip the tiny, lackluster portion of ""DEVILS ON HORSEBACK"" (bacon wrapped dates). The NEW BEDFORD JUMBO SCALLOPS on the regular menu are some of the best ones I've had - perfectly cooked with a nice smoky flavor.

Don't get me wrong.  The service is beyond excellent.  We were well taken care of and our table was checked in on every ten minutes or so to make sure we were comfortable.

The fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=aA_po75wwNmG17nAJRbA-w) are really, really good.  So good that it may have overshadowed the rest of the dishes.  And, they're free!

The bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=zfNxS8fv1_fwMvMb9ka8aA) came in an iron skillet of sorts, warm and fresh out of the oven.  Well seasoned and soft.

Skip the lobster fritters (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=4SSJ0mnzE0v1w69Xpmwdag).  It was flavorless.  I didn't taste lobster.  I didn't taste bacon.  I just taste fried dough.  Bleh.

I had the Kansas strip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=FBhiB59p-kaGZlbKi7adQw).  It's a really intimidating piece of meat, 14 oz in all.  Good thing I took the rest to go and it was still fine the next morning.  The texture was a bit too chewy for my taste...but I would have gotten yelled at if I ordered the prime rib at a steak house.

The 16 oz bone-in rib eye (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=V7XFHkvuJnnrXErP7T0JCw) was good, too.  Maybe even better than the Kansas strip.

The creamed spinach (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=-kT8S3f8RYyMTk4hpmD-qg) was a good complement to our steaks.

Came by on a Saturday night with a party of six and we had to wait about an hour and a half before we got seated. By the time we did get seated they had run out of: brisket, burnt tips, smoked catfish, smoked chex mix and their potato casserole which included a couple things that I had wanted to try. 

I ended up going with the two meat platter and got bacon meat loaf and fried cat fish while one of my friends got pulled pork and ribs. The ribs and meat loaf were pretty good, but the pulled pork was a little dry and the fried cat fish was just average as well. I would say all the sides are pretty delicious and I had a try at the cornbread, potato salad, slaw, and beans. The corn bread is outstanding with bits of meat in it and the potato salad was pretty good as well. You get to choose hot sauces to go with your meal and I would definitely recommend the Georgia peach! I will have to try this place again to see how the brisket, burnt tips, and smoked cat fish are!",2015-09-08 12:31:01

The staff was very accommodating to the constant change in number of people attending, but luckily on a Sunday evening, it was not packed. Had a nice seating outside, communal table style.

Various appetizers, and tried the grits with sausage and brussel sprouts. Very tasty. I ordered the pork osso buco confit with the waiter and coworker's recommendation. It being served with the spaetzle was a huge plus, which was pretty good. The pork was very tender and fell off the bone. We also indulged in local AZ wine as on Sundays, bottles are half off!

My favorite part was the cheddar bacon biscuits we ordered with the apple butter. Biscuits were very flaky and delicious!

For dessert I went with the chocolate covered bacon and s'mores, a deconstructed version. I don't like marshmallows, but these were homemade and tasted super different than Kraft, in a good way! Whipped peanut butter and graham crackers were excellent as well. I tasted my coworker's peach cobbler, and that was even yummier!

mRYiqSwo6ZXExF5yROLl5Q,yaBIVHDxaUBN2YHQ8-YiuQ,PEWqLRLzzUIeucqYdkjxYA,1,10,4,1,"Cabs in Pittsburgh are not like cabs in other cities.  In Chicago, cabs are part of the transportation landscape.  You go stand outside and hail one.  Maybe you have to walk to a busy corner, but whatever, you can find one.  Not so, in Pittsburgh.  On the rare occasion you see a cab, it's already got somebody inside, and you need to call.  Fine.  One more reason the transit here is a total fail.

So I need to get downtown on a Saturday morning by 8 am.  I call a little after 7:15 and ask if I can get a cab to pick me up at 7:45.  No can do, the dispatcher says - you can't reserve times.  You call when you are ready and then the cab is dispatched.  She also told me this after I was on hold for 10 minutes so I was already cranky.

Maybe this is common practice - is it?  But it's really annoying.  I had no idea how long it would take the cab to get to me - if I called when I was ""ready,"" the cab might take forever and I'd be late.  if I call before I'm ready the cab might be early and either charge me for waiting, or just leave.  But I took a chance and called around 7:30.  The lady on the phone said it'd be about 20-30 minutes and I was SO angry - I CALLED 20-30 minutes before and you told me to call when I was READY and now I'm READY and now I have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WHAAAAAAAAAAT.

Fortunately, a cab was dispatched and got to me within 5 minutes which was a total surprise, but I managed to get my stuff together and get out the door when he arrived. Seriously - don't say 20 minutes and then it's 5 minutes. People need accurate information!

So I get in the cab, and the very chatty driver proceeds to be a complete jerk.  It takes maybe 10-12 minutes to get  me downtown, and in that time he proceeded to make fun of Indian people by doing a fake accent - charming.  And then he used the word ""b*tch"" twice to refer to women.  Joked about kidnapping the actress who plays Hermione Granger and bringing her home to his kids and commanding her, ""do a spell, b*tch!""  And using the B-word to describe women who call cabs the morning after a one-night stand.

Maybe if I'd been saying racist and sexist things, it would've made sense for him to join right in, but he just said this stuff out of the blue, unprompted.  I was so offended, but when I'm in the cab of person like that, I don't feel comfortable saying anything since we're essentially alone.  But I tell you - if I ever get a cab again and he's the driver, I'd say forget it.  I'm tempted to call and complain - this guy was the worst.  I got to my destination on time at least, which is a relief since I'd hate to spend one more minute with him than I'd have to.

Yuck.  I don't ever want to take a cab in this city again, and I'd go out of my way to avoid doing so if this is what their service is like.",2011-06-13 16:04:39

I was a party of 1 because I had been desperately craving Korean BBQ. The prices are pretty reasonable, although I know most of you will whine that they aren't AYCE. They have slightly lower prices on certain meats during lunch and happy hour. I started off with the typical pork belly, beef brisket and seaweed salad. I must say the quality of meats is a step above the other AYCE places on Spring Mtn. hence you get what you pay for. Both meats were very delicious and I was still a tad bit hungry so my server recommended to me pork toro. The meat was just okay and I actually prefer the pork belly instead of this, plus it's cheaper too. The service was good for the most part, but since the place was empty, at one point the server and host both disappeared on me, which delayed me from ordering my second round of meat. It wasn't too big a deal because someone eventually appeared again in the dinning room. I live really close to this place and I will probably be coming more often. This is a perfect option if you want Korean BBQ, but your waistline can't afford to do AYCE. Also a nice place for lunch, because if I would of stuck to the beef brisket, pork belly and rice my bill would of been around $10.

The atmosphere itself is amazing--starting with the shockingly white decor, attractive hostesses, huge goldfish tanks, and even the very walls of the restaurant (white panels with cut out shapes set in front of the actual walls).

And that's where the magic stops.  Things didn't start well when the hostess (as attractive as she may be) made me wait for a table even though the restaurant was barely a quarter full.  They may have been severely understaffed, but that excuse is probably giving BNN9 way too much credit.  On my way out of the restaurant, she pulled the same routine with another diner.  Unsurprisingly, the poor service (which was neither fast nor friendly) continued inside the restaurant--sending the clear message that BNN9 neither cared about nor desired your patronage.

The Char Siu Bao (steamed pork buns) was okay, with the nice soft doughy exterior as expected, but the barbecue pork filling seemed to be a little short on flavoring (at least for a what should be a high quality bun).  The Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Soup was enjoyable, with the seaweed and dried baby shrimp providing unique taste accents.  Finally, while I'm a fan of auspiciousness, $7.09 for a bottle of Tsing Tao borders on insanity.

Our server was doing the best she could trying to accommodate us as much as possible as we waited for our food (generously speaking, there was a little bit of delay), the ambiance was great, the drinks were well made, and as we sat at the table behind the open kitchen bar we watched the chefs pump plate after plate out. We, like many others, ordered a selection of small plates and they were definitely all edible, just on different levels.

-the samosa: not much of a doughy pocket, but excelled as a fried wonton filled with deliciousness.
-the scotch egg: unappealing overcooked green ring aside it was amazing. one of the better in town. love the mustard sauce. 
-the shrimp: my friend scoffed at my love of them, without the sauce. they tasted exactly like how my father used to cook them in the summertime, which we decided was due to their simplicity, but seriously, I was on memory lane and I didn't care. (sometimes it's nice to showcase what a food can do on its own)
-the crabcakes: good crab meat/breading ratio. loved the pineapple and mango with it. 

Then, a few nights ago my sister and I stopped in to redeem my almost forgotten about livingsocial. Around 930 on a Wednesday night, we ended up being one of three tables in the place. We grabbed the jalap poppers and the hummus to start. The poppers were a bit of a russian roulette. Some were fine, nothing too spicy, and then every third one or so there would be a surprising explosion of pimiento cheese and heat from the pepper. (It was fairly entertaining.) The hummus was awesome, though it had more of the consistency of a tapenade to me, and the pita chips were delish. We moved on to the medium plates and I grabbed the santa fe chicken and she took the veggie burger.  Both were really nice, I loved the flavors on my sandwich, but I think when I return I'll go back to sampling multiple small plates.

MA8rRuDMnfokfUlpbBEEyw,bNVWxkusRF2SXlBtE37OIA,o_TPuqXuH-O_FbEkFNACUA,3,0,0,0,"Summary: Hakka restaurant holds its own in saucy classics such as Manchurian and Chili chicken, but REALLY stands out with it's dry chicken seasoning, although you'll have to forgive the service and average portion size

Top Must-Get: Bombay chicken 
Top Regret: Spring rolls

My friend and I have come here for lunch a few times as it's right in the area. It's in a quiet plaza just south of Frederick's, which is a more well-known Hakka restaurant - making comparisons between the two natural. Frederick's offers literally more (both in menu options and quantity), but Hakka Legend, in my experience, has a slight edge in flavour and taste in some of its dishes.

FOOD
Manchurian chicken: this is my go-to Hakka dish. At Hakka Legend, it was good but not incredible. The colour of the sauce was less vivid than others (and that's a good thing - I find I am a bit more cautious eating bright red foods than dull coloured sauces). 3.5/5

Bombay chicken: amazing flavour in this dry rub dish, although it leans to the slightly salty end. This has plenty of kick, and the more you eat it, the more the heat will kick in. 4.5/5

Lunch specials come with your choice of soup or spring roll. Neither were particularly amazing, but the spring roll tasted oily and soggy the first time I had it. The second time around, it was slightly better, but I definitely wouldn't come here for those.

SERVICE
You get your seats and your order in pretty quickly, and your food comes not too long after that, but that's where it seems to end. It's not too busy, so the slow service is really puzzling. 

We had our water refilled once (and only after a few minutes of trying to flag someone down), and this has happened almost every time I've been here. To be fair, the owner seems to care when he's not in the kitchen, but the serving staff are definitely not appearing interested in customer service.

My thought is that restaurants that want to get away with shoddy service or check-ins should really provide whole pitchers of water/drinks. How can you serve spicy foods and not expect people to get thirsty?

The service pulls it down to a 3/5. However, the Bombay chicken (and close proximity) keeps me coming back from time to time.",2017-02-07 07:13:45

They do a marvellous Korean mochi with sweet, red bean paste ... stretchy outside bursting with smooth, sweet, red bean inside.

You can explore at your own leisure with the audio tour device (which are available in English, Spanish and French), or join the daily docent tour at 2 p.m. I recently did both during one visit.  I joined the docent tour of the Andy Warhol exhibit and found the docent to be extremely knowledgeable, informative, and held our attention with stories about the artist that we would not have heard otherwise.  I then just walked around on my own to fully appreciate the art.  Previously, I had been to the Monet exhibit and was very impressed with the collection that was displayed.  

For a small exhibit, they are able to procure some great works of art to share with the community and art lovers.  And if you are an art AND wine lover- be sure to check out their Art & Wine event every second Wednesday of the month.  There is great FREE art to view too, you just have to be on the lookout as you walk through the Bellagio Hotel.

He couldn't get our order right, his eyes were glazed over and (here's the kicker) he ran his fingers through my husband's hair!  We alerted the manager out of concern for the waiter- was he drunk?

I wanted lobster pho or the surf and turf pho, but for the price tag of $49 (I think) and $35 respectively, I compromised with oxtail pho which was a lot more reasonable at $14. After all, pho is pho right?

The oxtail soup was clean. It was refreshing and the meat was falling off the bone. Good size meat pieces too. 

As the lobster pho passed by, it did look like a legit size/portion and looked AMAZINGLY good, but still don't know if I would be willing to fork out the cash. 

The service was good and the menu looked very interesting. I'm looking forward to going back to try other items on the menu.

it smells like fish intensely when you walk in.  then your olfactory fatigue sets in and you bask in the seafaring decorations and tablecloths  they help to call this place their home away from home.

the place itself is like a triangular sliver of a place.  its like no one knew what to do with this strange spot and these guys just slithered in here and made it fantastic.  i feel like theyve used every inch of space they could in an efficient way. 

it seems this place is owned by a japanese couple, hence the excellent use of space.  there are a couple tables, covered with the blue and white checkered tablecloths.  behind those tables is a miniature black and white portable tv.  around that are many drinks, magazines, condiments, and other items related to seafood for sale.

i ordered the special for the day which was a combo of homemade clam chowder and a calamari sandwich.  this was all for ten bucks.  both of them were awesome.  the clam chowder even seemed to have extra bits of seafood in it.  it was hot, creamy and plentiful.  the sandwich was in the freshest of buns, with lettuce, spiced and fried calamari and a little lemon for good measure.

as i was sitting there eating a crabby looking woman in a parka waddled in and asked about the specials for the day.  she was allergic to calamari so she opted for another fish atop a salad.  she had to go get cash (as they only take cash) and proceeded to horde a bunch of free gum that the owners leave out for customers in a little box that has a sign on it saying ""no one likes fishy breath, take a piece of gum.""  i guess for her that meant free is free, so there.  the owner looked at the box when she left for her money, shook his head with a smile and i asked him what happened (i hadnt noticed that box until this incident).  he sort of gave a shrug of the shoulders, we both giggled and that was that.  he still treated her with the same respect he had before the gum incident.

This location just opened last Wednesday!!! They are located in the old Polka Dots location in the shopping plaza on Woodlawn Rd. I'm so excited to try all their flavors!!!

They have a great $2 Tuesday special where all the cupcakes are $2 and the cookies and cakepops are $1. 

I was very good on this trip and only got one cupcake. I couldn't decide and the young man working said his favorite was the cookies and creme truffle cupcake so I had to get it. Some of the cupcakes seem to be stored in a refrigerated case. This one wasn't. 

As for the cupcake it was very tasty. I'm not a chocolate fan and this cupcake was not overwhelming chocolaty. The actually cake was good but the best part was the delicious frosting and the creamy center. I believe the frosting has to have marshmallow in it but I'm not sure. It was soooo good. 

I will definitely be back to try other flavors like caramel apple and the mint Oreo!",2017-05-23 23:21:53

The 1PM show got moved to somewhere around 3PM or 4PM. Throughout the afternoon it was pretty hard to get any accurate info on the exact when and where of anything and where to wait, etc. Not even the band had the info to give us since the restaurant hadn't figured out all the kinks yet. We were all starving and got take out from inside the restaurant. The food was pretty good. We got a variety of items and everything tasted awesome. Once everything got going it was a bit more organized but still a bit confusing.

I call and lo and behold, it ""just"" came in. So I go in to pick it up and the old, grumpy lady asks me if someone called me. Haha. No, no one called me. I had to call YOU guys and I had to wait on hold for over 10 mins until the nice gentleman that works there told me it was in. 

BTW when I paid the said $400+, the old grumpy lady messed up. I never been to Hancock before, so I didn't have a Hancock card. She set me up with one, but when I left she didn't give me the card. I asked for it, and she made a huge deal about me already having a card and I was already in the system. After I asked the gentleman to check the number of the card, the old grump realized she had my card in front of her the whole time. And then she just handed it to me and looked away.

It was definitely a vegas bucket list for me. The space is hidden on the 10th floor of the Venetian and it's kind of hard to find. The restaurant I think is a beautiful open space with a classic French design. The menu isn't too expansive. It's small and the way it's organized can be a little confusing. 

We started off with mimosas, escargot, froie grois pate, and the small seafood platter as appetizers. They also served is complimentary bread with the most delicious butter and blackberry jam combination. I loved the escargots . It can with a puff pastry on top to soak up the garlicky oil goodness. I even dipped extra bread in that sauce. The texture of the escargot and flavor was on point. The froie was good but it's was really hard. Like a spoon can stand upright in it. I definitely like the taste of a actual froie filet better but texture of this was good. I give it 3/5 stars.   The seafood platter was a beauty. We couldn't stop snapping pics of it. The lobster is flavored and it was delicious. The texture was a little chewy. The shrimp was also plump and fresh but it would have been ""crispier"" if you know what I mean. The oysters were delicious!  Both kinds were. Sweet and fresh. Loved them. The mussels were ok. Could have passed on that.

We didn't get our mimosas until after the appetizers and the waitress felt so bad she gave it to us on the house. That was such a sweet gesture. I love it when restaurants comp things for you when service isn't just right. 

For main dishes we got the croquet Madame, the salmon plate, the burger and the steak hash which was the special. The croque Madame is so rich and buttery and gluttonous. I don't think I can eat all of that but my friends did. We also upgraded to truffle fries and that was an excellent idea since it was delicious and the biggest hit. I liked my salmon plate. Nothing special and it's something you can make at home though. The steak hash wasn't that great actually. For 30 bucks it tasted like the steak hash I can get at a diner.

Pros:
Well made dishes
Friendly service

Cons:
Long wait for food
Portions could be better

I had the day off so I went downtown to take my GF for lunch.  We were feeling Thai and noticed this place on the way thinking about Salad King.  I'm almost certain this place used to be a Chinese restaurant but I'm not absolutely certain.  Walking up the steps, there are quite a bit more seats than I thought there would be.  There are plenty of seats.

We're greeted by the staff and he's very pleasant and nice throughout our stay there.  We're seated immediately and given the menus.  There's quite a bit to choose from.  There's also a lunch special menu with about 7-8 entrees for $7.95.  Everything on the lunch special comes with a soup and spring roll.  My GF ordered the green curry from the lunch menu and I got the Pad Kee Mong from the regular menu.

The free soup and spring roll come out pretty quickly.  My GF had the soup and we split the spring roll.  She says the soup is pretty good.  The spring roll was nice and crispy. It takes about 25 minutes for my dish to come out and then another 10 minutes more for my GF's curry to come.  If you're here casually, it's no biggie, but when you're on a lunch hour, it's very ideal.  By the time my GF got her curry, she had 10 minutes to eat before she had to rush back to work.  We were a bit unlucky because we got there just after 3 other tables had sat down.  This probably contributed more to the wait time than anything.

The dishes themselves were very good though.  Previous reviews all rave about the authenticity.  I have no idea what real authentic Thai tastes like, but these dishes were definitely very good and had a unique flavour.  I was very impressed.  I wished the portions could of been better.  My GF is not the biggest eater so when she wanted bigger portions, you know they could of been better.

All in all, a very good Thai place to try.  I would definitely recommend this place if you got plenty of time to spare.  Going during lunch hour can be risky as if they're busy, you might spend most of your lunch hour just waiting.  The service was spectacular as well.",2016-04-28 11:32:39

The problem lies in the amount of grease and salt in the dishes, which was a great deal.  The zucchini box stained paper underneath it and the bag it was placed in glistened with grease.  I took advantage of a coupon offer for $9.90 for a large pizza with one topping.  The Tambellini large pizza is considered a small at other establishments like the great Mineo's Pizza House in Squirrel Hill and Mount Lebanon.  It contains eight average size slices. The restaurant was stingy with the amount of mushrooms placed on the pizza, which were few and far between. I was intrigued by the low price for the zucchini, but found upon opening the box that it is a tiny portion relative to restaurants that charge more for the dish. The zucchini was limp from the grease.  The meat sauce which accompanied it was delicious.

The inside is very true to the theme- lots of old time-y decorations and they have the original menu up on the wall too for comparison.
Since it was my first time at Mickey's I had to get the Scrambler - for those few who have yet to try one, you get to choose your fillings and a cheese and it comes on top of a mound of potatoes with gravy. I decided on broccoli with pepper jack cheese.
My dining companion decided on the Reuben omelet based on a recommendation by our server and got cheese and onions on the yanks (potatoes). It was a really interesting combination of flavors for an omelette but it all worked together really well!
The portion sizes are HUGE- at least two if not three to four meals worth of food.
Their coffee was surprisingly very tasty - much better than typical unlimited diner coffee.
We also couldn't leave without trying one of their shakes -we got the malted chocolate shake and it was delicious (as expected). They also were super nice and gave us the excess shake since we were sharing.",2017-06-24 03:13:46

Since it was my birthday and my friends know I am such a foodie, I got a sampling of a few things that were ordered :)  I love my friends!

Fried Chicken - double coated and fried, very crunchy, excellently cooked tender flavorful chicken. It's a special of Thursdays. It was great!
Pastrami Sandwich - great meat with cole slaw and excellent bread (pretezel, a chicago favorite!)
Jambalaya - Very yummy, perfect consistency and great tasting.  Comes with Shrimp, chicken, sausage and okra, each piece cooked to the perfect consistency
Cheese Burger - Perfectly cooked burger, great flavor, excellent bun made of angus beef, and cheddar and with grilled onoins


Salted Caramel Pudding - a nice sweet and salty treat to top it off, a bit overly on the salty side, it kinda burned my throat, but still very good.

The first time we came here, everything was spot on. We ordered Combo A. Our server cooked our food for us, everything was tasty and DELICIOUS. The fried rice at the end of our meal was AMAZING.

I ended up returning with another couple. This time we had AYCE. I didn't even KNOW they had AYCE! Everything was fantastic. This place was in my heart again.

The hostesses were sweet and friendly, and once seated our server was professional and pleasant, never pressuring us to order hastily, really letting us relax and enjoy our meal.  The service here never disappoints - it is always on point.

Oysters and hamachi were the appetizers we chose, and both were delicious.  We really enjoyed the green goddess sauce served with the oysters, and the hamachi was probably my favorite dish of the night.  The fish was buttery and fresh, and the sauce drizzled over it had a nice heat that really punched up the overall flavor of the dish.  Definintely recommend trying it!

The steaks were perfect per usual, and the seafood was just as fresh as I remembered.  The server recommended the ribeye, and it really was the star of the show.  A blue cheese topping took it over the top, but it was not so heavy that the entire steak could not be finished by one person.
For sides we loved the mushrooms and pearl onions.  They tasted great as a topping on just about everything, but also as a side just eaten on their own.  The pureed potatoes were also creamy and delicious (something new that we tried), but the portion size was huge.  One order is plenty for 4+ adults to share, and definitely try them topped with lobster.  
If you save room, the sorbet for dessert is a simple, sweet way to end your meal, but if you are feeling more decadent, the dessert menu should not be missed.

Be sure to make reservations - and don't miss the Hamachi!

We didn't have reservations but got seated right away. The ambiance was great, warm and dark and the place was mostly full the whole time. 

I got a chocolate martini and even though I usually don't like martinis I really loved it. The bf tried to order two different beers that they were out of before finding one they had. Their beer selection was good but then they seemed to be out of quite a few on the menu. 

We got angry calamari that was really perfect. Then we got the perogie sampler which was really more like ravioli than perogies, it was alright.

Then for our meals. I tried to order the bone-in ribeye but they were out. So I got the pork chops. The bf got the smoked chicken ravioli which was to die for. My pork chops were amazing too. They were the best pork chops I've had, the baked apples were chopped up small so you could get some - along with bbq sauce and mashed potatoes - in every bite. But the chicken ravioli was even better. I am definitely getting that next time.

The second time coming here was their T-Bone (roast beef, turkey, bacon, cheddar, horseradish & mayo). Though the T-Bone is on the cold subs menu, ask them that you want it hot and it brings out more flavor to the roast beef. Not really that big of a fan of mustards, so the horseradish sauce kind of ruined the taste for me but overall it was still an ok sub.

First of all, someone please tell me why the kitchen is out in the open right when you walk in...with bright cooking lights shining and only a few feet away from the dance floor. Talk about mood kill. When you are trying to have fun and dance and drink with friends... it's kind of awkward to have an open kitchen right in your face. Just a stupid and awkward set up. The kitchen should be in the restaurant area, not the night club area. 

We did go sit in the back and grab food before we headed to the ""club"". It was just okay. Nothing to write home about. Too expensive for what it is. I got a cajun hamburger and fries, which cost $16. Then, I got a Sangria to drink which was $10. After it was all said and done after tip, My meal alone was $32 bucks. A little ridiculous for one person for average food that wasn't even that good.

I went last night which was a Sunday, so not sure how the rest of the nights are... but this place is 100% country. Stoneys at least breaks it up and will play some booty shakin freestyle dance music every hour or so to change it up, which I like since I don't really country dance well. Unless you are a die hard country music lover, this place probably wont be for you. They didn't even play cupid's shuffle or the cha cha slide. The basic fun and less country line dances that everyone knows and loves.

Now the final straw.. This bikini bull riding. It went on ALL night long pretty much. It consisted of mostly overweight or obese women in bikinis and underwear trying to look sexy on the bull... while the lighting and jiggling of the bull accentuates every dimple and unsightly flaw. I was embarrassed for them. However, this was mildly entertaining, plus there was some fun and nice people there to talk to from a convention that made good company.... so that's why I give 2 stars. 

The old Gilleys was a blast. Had a bigger and better lay out. Had better ambiance and appeal and seemed more with it.. and more like a night club and bar. This Gilleys has the wrong lay out and you are next to a bright kitchen and a small dance floor, and watching the bull is the highlight of the night.

I got the stone pot which was delicious. A scorching hot stone pot to keep your rice hot throughout the meal. Comes with veggies, an egg, and bulgogi - which I pretty much really thinly sliced marinated beef. I love getting the stone pot because if you leave the rice undistrubed for maybe 5 mins, it becomes burnt and very crispy which adds a nice crunch to the meal. My one critique could be that I wish the bulgogi was more flavored, however there was so much going on in my stone pot that my mouth was exploding with different spices. 
Another nice thing is that you can buy all the little side dishes or kimchi togo. So you can just stop in and stock up for home.",2013-06-17 16:12:40

I originally gave them 4 stars thinking they were just another decently good boba place. I thought they were just another place to grab a drink and go. I thought they were just small competition for my previous go-to-spot for boba.. I thought wrong..

After a bit more exploring their wide variety of drinks on their menu, and a few long and exhausting study sessions there (thanks UNLV).. I discovered there was more than what I knew about boba. There existed things like real taro slushes that don't taste overly artificial, or Okinawa tea that doesn't jip you flat on flavor. 

Brew tea bar also offers the ""love your drink or we will remake for free"" deal (not that I ever had to have a drink remade). Staff is also 24/7 friendly and welcoming. Their crepes are fresh and about half price of competitors, and their clean interior and free wifi makes it an ideal place to study (not like other boba cafes that play a strange playlist of Korean pop mixed with mainstream radio hits on max volume and reek of second hand smoke, yuck!).

Not knowing how big the portion sizes would be, we also ordered a fried rice dish, and Ka re moo. (coconut curry dish with pork). Once again the portion sizes were on the small side.  
I thought from reading other reviews, that I may have found my new Thai restaurant without having to travel all the way downtown.
It looks like I'll still be making the trek to the King and I. (Mel the owner is very personable). 
In summation, did I say this place had small portions. Yeah it does. Let me break it down for you. Appy 4 small spring rolls(1 order), coconut rice(Bland) for 4, Ka re moo, and an order of fried rice. Oh yeah and one diet Pepsi  $55.00. Plus tip.

This business should focus on product quality late night instead of speed.  If they took a few extra moments to improve the final product and ensuring things were fresh they could be busier.  Instead they had no line in the drive thru and put out mediocre late night snackage.",2015-09-21 15:58:34

There were only 2 tables occupied and I was greeted promptly but the server had to go back and ask somebody in the kitchen about the soup - I'm not sure if she was asking if they had any left or if they had it at all. Some guy from the back peeked out to see who was inquiring and quickly withdrew with a startled look on his face after checking me out. The server told me yes they indeed had it and that it would cost $5.60 (a little steep) and that they only took cash. I went to the Scotia Bank a few doors down (not my bank) and it wouldn't give me any money so I rustled up some change from the car (luckily I had that much, I normally don't) then I went back to place my order and proceeded to wait almost 20 minutes for 1 soup!!

The washrooms are a bit dirty and the carpeted interiors definitely need an overhaul. However, this place excels in every other category. There's really REALLY good service here. The waitress we had was super friendly. For the food: 

Satay chicken skewer (appetizer; 4 skewers): We were pleasantly surprised to see it came with a fruit salad, but it was tossed in a ranch/caesar dressing. The fruit was fresh but the sauce was kind of an odd choice. Next time, we'll be sure to ask the waitress that we just want the fruit on its own. The skewers themselves are great. There wasn't really a satay flavour, but it came with a peanut sauce which was amazing. (Skewers were 4.5/5 stars, weird fruit salad was 2/5)

Free soup to start (Choice of Chinese, cream, or Russian borscht): We had the Chinese and borscht. Both were good. Nothing out of the ordinary (think Campbell soup), but it was tasty (3.5/5 stars)

Baked beef brisket with rice: The sauce was great and had a bit of a kick but don't worry, it's not too spicy at all. The beef was perfectly cooked as well. (4/5 stars)

Sweet and sour pork rice: The meat was well cooked and had a lot of crunchy parts, which was great. The sauce was tasty too. (4/5 stars)

Cold H.K. milk tea = A great drink for a hot summer day. If you've had milk tea from Lucullus, I would say that it's a bit milkier/sweeter here. (5/5 stars)

Overall, it all came to around $34 for everything and the portion sizes were big. We had to take the entrees to go. HK Bistro Cafe is a great choice if you're in the area.",2017-06-25 19:13:13

Originally I was just going to see if I could get a walk-in blowout but when I stumbled upon Parlour, the buzzy new salon at the foot of Ossington, I thought, ""hey, I am kinda overdue for a haircut - why not!"" 

Thankfully Trevor was able to get me a walk-in time with Paul, and while I waited he gave me free wi-fi access so I could finish up some work, and a lovely Vitamin Water (that happened to be my favourite flavour!) to quench my thirst. Things were off to a great start!

Paul, an Irish ex-pat with a love of Sinead O'Connor, strong aversion to all things Sinatra and an uncanny resemblance to Stephen Rea (of The Crying Game - also Irish!), took a good, long look at my hair situation, asked me what was on my mind and then took me to have my hair washed - truly the best part of any salon experience. 

Parlour uses Kevin Murphy products, an Australian line of hair products made with natural ingredients, high grade essential oils and amino acids. All good stuff, and no yucky parabens or sulphates. I also had a hair treatment ($10) since my tresses had been under an extra amount of duress lately with all the hot tools I'd been subjecting them to.

The music in Parlour is old-timey and sexy - I glanced around a few times looking for a freakin' gramophone, because it was that crackly 1920s/1930s music that makes you wanna do 'jazz hands' and waltz with the nearest stranger.

Paul cut and cut and cut. And razored and razored. He was meticulously precise about every movement and I appreciated his attention to detail. The cut looked fabulous wet, but I wasn't particularly fond of the way he styled it once it was dry (curly - which I don't often do, and I really wanted to see it straight), so when I spoke up he immediately made things right and flat ironed it so I could see his handiwork. 

It looked amazing and he took several pounds of heavy weight (I have a LOT of fine hair) off my head. I've only washed my hair a few times since the cut a few weeks ago but the styling is standard and looks good straight or wavy, and I love how tiny and slim my ponytail is now! I'll be back.

Don't let the exterior fool you; yes, its in a strip mall.   And even the interior, yes, its relatively non-descript and pretty tight.

However, the quality and thought behind the food makes for a delicious experience; whether you go the sushi route or the Japanese grill, you won't be disappointed.    

This isn't a meal that is rushed, so if you only have 45 minutes for dinner wait for another night.  (Yes, the service is pretty inconsistent as most of the other reviews have indicated.)",2014-04-10 20:33:34
qQh8GKMe95HWzmVXA9hmhg,iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ,3,2,1,2,"I've been here about three times. Some things are good, some things suck. For example, this place claims to be the Home of the Original Margarita (apparently created in 1941).  Just goes to show that time can improve upon almost anything... because their margaritas suck!  They are super sour and not much tequila.  I also hate mai tais from Trader Vics.  Original does not mean good, people!

But the food here is actually pretty unique if you are adventurous.  It is high quality food and the price reflects that (e.g. $4 per taco, which are small street tacos).  

You can get bone marrow tacos (which I actually would not recommend), beef cheek tacos (which I do recommend if you like gamey flavors) and tongue tacos (gotta try everything at least once - and not too bad!).  Just keep in mind, the portion sizes are seriously small and they charge extra for things you normally wouldn't expect, like getting diced tomatoes and lettuce on your tacos.  I mean seriously, 50 cents for lettuce on my tacos!?! That better be some seriously good, mind-blowing lettuce.

Just make sure to ask a lot of questions about portion size and presentation before ordering so you aren't surprised or disappointed.  For example, as other reviewers have said, the nachos are basically individual chips with the nacho toppings expertly placed on them.  Not the typical huge plate of tortilla chips covered in toppings that we normally associate with bar food.

One thing that is great about this place is the mariachi band.  They are hilarious!  One of them has a harp!  They play a great variety of songs and occasionally call for audience participation, which can score you free drinks.  My friend and I were the loudest at yelling ""TEQUILA!"" during the Tequila song which scored us free tequila shots.

Also, the chips and salsa are free and are both pretty good! Despite the fact that the chips come out of what appears to be a popcorn machine.

Keep an open mind, stay away from the margaritas, be prepared to shell out a bit more than you normally would, and make sure you come here when the mariachi band is playing (call ahead).  Then you will have a good time!",2010-12-20 20:32:22

I had never had it or even seen it anywhere besides there (probably because of that whole ""secret menu"" thing chinese restaurants like to do). So when I moved from the Tempe area a few months ago, not being a stones throw from Miu's was, quite honestly, the saddest part.

When I found out the Szechwan Palace (Located about three blocks from where I used to live in Arcadia, BTW) also offered the spicy cucumbers, dan dan noodles, and spicy lamb ribs I had come to love, I was so excited to try it and PRAYED it would fill the void in my life that Miu's once filled.  Well, it didn't.

That's not to say it's not like 1000x better than any other ""Americanized"" Chinese restaurant out there (Also, it's hilarious that they have a an actual section of the menu called ""Americanized Chinese""), but when comparing Apple to Apples (which I always do when it comes to restaurants like this) Miu's is a 5 and Szechwan is about a 3. Here's my deal (and i ordered my exact order):

1) Spicy cucumbers were warm  One of the most delightful aspects of this dish is the cool temperature combined with the heat.  Warm cucumber are gross.

2) Dan Dan noodles were standard. Much cheaper than Miu's though so that got them a star

3) Spicy Lamb Ribs were a little weak. I get that I'm a white girl drinking pinot grigio, but a can handle my heat.  Please don't coddle me. 

Basically, if you need szechwan in the area, which I do, I'm glad they are here.  But if you are looking for top notch food, go to miu's.  If you're looking for top notch service, don't get chinese, because it sucks everywhere.",2013-11-10 03:38:09

We started with the soup of the day (a sweet potatoe soup) and ordered the grilled salmon with pasta and eggplant parmesan (a special of the day) to have for entree. We asked for a recommendation for what to have with our meal and were recommended a red wine. The soup tasted good flavour wise but could have been a little creamier and less watery. Both main were good, but it was a little surprsing that the eggplant parmesan wasn't served with anything else (no pasta? no rice?). It tasted great (I love eggplant), but wish I was told that so I could order something to go with it. We didn't think the wine went well with the meal, and it was a little sour as well (the perils of ordering per glass I guess). For dessert we ordered the house made tiramisu.

Classes range in price. My two classes were a little under 400$. One class is a 8 week class and one of my classes is a 6 week class. So for the amount of classes I am taking its a pretty good deal. 

I highly recommend this place.",2017-01-12 17:34:55

The Italian cab tasted like pinot noir and not particularly great pinot at that. 

I got the calamari and then the steak for dinner. The calamari was fried perfectly, the batter was crispy and the inside was soft. The shishito peppers and lemon created some depth without being overly strong. The steak was prepared perfectly as well, a true medium and the meat was marbled and delicious. The roasted garlic and Brussel sprouts were more like a garnish but added some flavor.

2) you can't win, so why play $25 hands. Last couple of times I've been here I've been massacred at the tables

I heard Windsor and Churn were opening up and I always love to check out a new place, especially when it is owned by someone with a good track record. When we pulled up I knew I was in love.

It's the ambiance and atmosphere of a restaurant that gives you a certain feel, a certain experience. Between the friendly and stylish staff, the people, the stung lights on the patio, and the wooden benches surrounded by catci pots they nailed it. The wall of cassette tapes and the saying son the walls were also a great touch. Our wait on a Fri night was surprisingly short and we had a cocktail waitress take care of us in the meantime. The drinks are kind of expensive but the No. 11 was tasty enough to warrant the price tag.

My boyfriend and I got a great seat on the patio. Privacy. We shared a kale caesar salad. Usually won cannot be all too wowed by a salad but damn was this good. What a long way a clever idea like cheddar croutons can go. Then we split a the brown bag chicken sandwich with friend okra. Tasty.

I came to StripSteak for a business function and a group of approximately 20 different people. The dining space is slightly upscale, with a welcoming atmosphere, nice lighting, and not ridiculously loud music. Service was tentative and friendly was worked our group well without hiccups. The food was from a fixed menu like usual with larger groups, choosing a starter, and your entree from 2-3 choices. I had a prawn starter that came with 3 large prawns and a sauce on the plate (i don't see this on regular menu). Fresh, good, and perfect starter for a much heavier beef entree to come very soon. My steak choices were of the 16 oz. Rib eye or 10 oz. Filet and i opted for the filet as i wasn't overly hungry and the smaller cut would be perfect. The meat was pleasantly prepared consistent throughout the table and was of quality you would expect at a place like StripSteak. Sides that were offered were Broccolini and Mashed Potatoes, the Broccolini was quite tasty and i didnt try the Potatoes but im sure they were good as well given the feedback at the table. All in all it was a good meal, actually the best i had over the 4 day event being in town and having a meal each night at a new place. You would expect that when you come to a place such as StripSteak, with the pricing that your meal should always be a thumbs up but its not the case. The same time last year a similar group went to Carnevino, and the quality of the food was not up to par as i am guessing it has to do with maybe the large group and fixed menu. So if your looking for a quality spot that will handle your corporate event, with good food, solid service, and a positive impression StripSteak ranks up there for me.",2016-05-02 21:24:16

The place has an interesting atmosphere. The restaurant is like an upscale diner with a trendy bar area.

I was here with a group from a conference I was attending here. We had a 45 minute wait when we arrived at 8pm so we started at the bar. The bartender seemed a little put off when we asked to sample the craft beer options.For me the draft options were just ok. The Deschutes IPA was the best of the bunch and at least I've had it before so I knew what I was getting into.

When finally seated at our table, we ordered a few appetizers - the pretzels with provolone cheese, the shrimp, and the zucchini fritters. The shrimp was the best of the bunch with a spicy coating. The fritters were second best but the pretzels were a disappointment. They were like pretzel rolls and huge with no real flavor. Same with the cheese. Smaller bites may have made them more enjoyable.

For an entree, I ordered the sea bass which came with barley and arugula. The fish was good and I enjoyed the crispy edges but the barley was too salty portion size was quite tiny. 

The best thing about this place to me was our server who was great with explaining specials, her favorites, and refilling drinks. But when you hit a restaurant, you expect the food to stand out and it did not for me.

However, yesterday at the Deer Valley location my sub took a long time to make and there was nobody in the store. Points off there. Hmmm, however, now that I think about it the guy gave me the more expensive bread option for no additional charge so that was cool!

The sandwich was tasty though.I guess the place is Ok. Nothing really to write home about. I just heard Firehouse Subs opened a store in AZ so that makes me want to write home more than my JJ experience.  My friend thinks Jimmy Johns is too expensive for their meal deals.

I was immediately skeptical when I entered the bakery, however, because the girl behind the counter was really skinny and pretty. I typically don't trust bakeries with skinny employees. But not to worry, this place is legit, I promise. Obviously, everything looked amazing so I asked the girl there for some recommendations. She basically recommended everything and then said, ""Oh, how could I forget about the cream puff!""

So Mesa Grill has been at the Caesar's for a while now and I'm always thinking, why would I pay a premium for Mexican food?  I live in LA; I have Mexican food everywhere.  But I see the light now.  It's Mexican/Southwestern fusion-ish food.  I came for lunch on Saturday and even though I made a reservation through Open Table, it wasn't busy.

Apps: Tiger Shrimp & Corn Tamale.  Only one is enough because it is super rich with the sauce but it is oh so good.  The corn was the sweet it needed to bite through all the garlic you taste from the tamale and sauce.  I felt a bit of a kick in the flavor as well.  The tamale was probably the best thing we had.

Entrees: Ranch Style Egg Tostada.  A sizeable scrambled egg atop a fried tortilla with a red chile sauce.  The like how the crunch tostada provided a different texture from the fluffy eggs.  Not very rich so it felt somewhat healthy.  The cheese added a bit of needed fat that I felt was  needed.  Overall a decent dish.

Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash: Sweet potato hash was a bit strange for me.  The hash made it too sweet and the chicken wasn't spicy enough to make it all come together.  The poached egg provided the fat but in the end just an OK dish.

The bread basket included an assortment of breads including the blue cornmeal cornbread muffin.  I thought this was the star of the basket.

So Mr. Bobby Flay.  The meal was pretty good.  Some dishes better than others.  I will definitely be back for the shrimp tamale and I heard there was a shrimp taco special which I wish I got.

The good was that the place was packed for the match. The bad? Let me count the ways. The straight out of the 80's building design and decor was the first bad sign. Then as you begin to enter the building, you feel as though you are entering a dungeon. But again, with so many people there, you think there has got to be some redeeming qualities. We get inside and get some food in the ""snack bar."" As we waited in line, I looked around and was too terrified to touch anything. Outdated furnishings and pieces that looked as though they couldn't be cleaned if you wanted to. I bought a bottle water, soft pretzel, and order of fries. Total was $6 which I thought to be very reasonable. The girl told me 3 min on the pretzel and fries. I got the pretzel in 3 min and the fries in 15 min. I was so pissed since the match started by then. When I finally got my food, we went to find seats. That was a total joke. There were folded chairs on the rink floor in addition to the seats on the outside of the rink. Every seat was filled and people standing everywhere. So apparently buying a ticket does not guarantee you a seat. Ridiculous. The match was just okay. I thought there would be more action but how much can there be when fans are sitting on the actual site of the match?  We didn't stay for the second match, after all, who wants to stand the whole time? My advice? Have low, low expectations before coming here and it shall not disappoint.",2010-02-21 05:25:23

It was literally just watered down; no flavor whatsoever! So we told the waitress nicely that we did not like the soup at all, its very bland. She basically just smiled and said, ""sorry"", and walked away. We noticed another employee was standing by whom could overhear the conversation, but did not offer any solution. My husband and I were just stunned, and figured that the employees doesn't really care about the customer's satisfaction.

Since switching jobs, now working in the Tempe area I've been on a Thai and Pho binge.  The second Thai restaurant I've tried in Tempe was Yupha's Thai Kitchen.  I decided to dine in.  After being seated, I sat alone for about 13 minutes before the server came to take my order.  I ordered Veggie Drunken Noodles.  She said help yourself to the salad and soup bar.  I did!

I was about 2 spoons in with my soup and my food came out.  It was SUPER quick!  While the server was putting my plate down I got a strong whiff of a fish smell.  He said enjoy and walked off.  I finished my soup and salad and took just one forkful of drunken noodles.  It was disgusting!  Gross!  It tasted like soggy noodles cooked in a pan with fish.  My server never came back.  I got the attention of a hostess, explained why I didn't like my meal and told her I'll just stick with the soul and salad. She explained the price difference in just ordering the soup and salad bar ($8) and a chicken meal ($9.50).  She was right so I decided to try something else.  I asked for a few suggestions.
She informed me that the Drunken Noodles are cooked with Thai Basil.  The Thai Basil cause that it's cooked in is fish based.  Who would have thought that?!  The items on the menu that is made with Oyster Sauce or Oyster Oil is indicated on the menu with parenthesis.  I think there should be some sort of indication of the fish content in ALL items, even those with Thai Basil.  

I also think when the hostess seats you, they should tell you to help yourself to the soup and salad bar.  Or, the person that brings the water should say something.

This place is a gold mine of delicious! From the outside you sort of expect it to be grimy and a little scary. Nope. It's clean, organized and has just about everything you need to have a Mexican feast.

My one very large complaint about the place. If you are not a fan of cilantro... then your choices become very limited on what you can add to your burritos or plates.  

Cilantro and lime rice
Pico de Gallo(which is to be expected)
Corn and cilantro...

That leaves you with sour cream... cheese...and lettuce to add as your toppings. 

I'm not a fan of cilantro... so the menu really shrank.

Biscuits and pig sauce (thick gravy) came with 3 large buiscuits to the portion. Little harder round the edges. Felt they may have sat under the heat lamp a little too long. Gravy was 100% fantastic. Thick and flavourful and a good size portion to go with the buiscuits.

You walk in and there is definitely an air of vintage feeling you get when you walk in.  I love that the place is split up by color which gives it a more organized, welcoming look than other vintage places where you feel like everything is a mess.

I found a few cool pieces there, but the prices were still a bit high for me to pay and for the most part, most of the pieces weren't my taste, but I still enjoyed perusing through the store and getting a little taste of fashion history along the way.

I probably wouldn't shop there regularly, but definitely planning on bringing my best friend next time she is in town because I know she will adore this place!",2013-03-10 03:46:02

It's on the pricey side but that's what you pay for friendly attentive service, hip atmosphere, and fusion food. It's a Vietnamese fusion. There were 2 of us so we sat at the bar, which is a full bar but we ordered their specialty drinks along with 5 food items.

Vietnamese donkey: 5/5 basically a lychee Moscow mule. Very light

Fresh coconut mojito: 5/5 it comes in a real coconut and tastes very refreshing. They also give you coconut juice on the side to drink as well

Pork belly buns: 4/5 good appetizer, nothing amazing. They used Vietnamese radish and carrots which was different but it didn't blow me away. 

Oxtail fries: 5/5 I loved it! Definitely recommend this as an appetizer or even a side dish. The meat was very tender and had a pulled pork consistency. It comes with a sunny side up egg too so if you don't want it to get too soggy just put the fries to the side and break the egg on the other side and dip it in 

Garlic noodles: 4/5 pricey for what it is. It was on the dry side and the garlic flavor wasn't completely there but the garnishes added a fresh flavor to it 

Shaken beef: 5/5 super tender and they used the more traditional Vietnamese butter rice I believe. This entree also came with eggs and you get to choose how it's cooked

Short rib combo plate: 4/5 short ribs were marinated very well and tasty, but portion on that was small. I only got 1 small slab of kalbi and the Chinese sausages were hard so I only had a bite of that and I was done. I liked that they also included an egg in the meal so I had it sunny side up so the yolk dropped over my rice when I punctured it.. Yummmm I love runny yolk 

Overall, I would defiantly recommend this place and come back to try other items on their menu",2016-01-23 03:31:00

They didn't seem to keen about it and watched us closely when we came back (perhaps to see if we'd dump the poo diaper in the bathroom? I took it home with me so they had nothing to worry about), but it's nice that they gave us the room.

Lunch specials are available, but you have to ask for them. They have a pretty decent selection, all around $8 - $9, and each comes with a spring roll and a drink. The lunch menus have a variety of food options, but the main menu is mostly northern food.

Luckily for all, especially me because I am bizarrely obsessed with this place, the food is still good!  The menu now is actually more diverse and with a greater selection.  I think it's actually cheaper too, now that I think of it.  So, that's good, right?  

Well, for the most part the change is okay.  I have a hard time saying that. I liked the old waitstaff and I could always understand them, just for the record.  Also, they took the best rolls (""smells like ex-girlfriend, candy cane, something wrong 69) off the menu and replaced them with ""super spider roll"" and other totally boring concoctions.

New Wait Staff.
New Menu.

Wait Staff - I am not sad to see the old wait staff gone. Some of the girls were not the most friendly. The new staff seems to much more helpful, attentive and friendlier.

New Menu - You still get the basics. However, the food has changed in the flavor. There is definitely more pizazz to some of the food items. At lunch the other day, I had deep fried pork ribs, eggplant, fried tofu, baby bok choy and pad thai. All of it decent and pretty tasty.

New Prices - After tax, I paid $8.48 for AYCE lunch buffet. Price increase, but now you get a drink included. Before it was separate price for drink.

New Interior Decorations - I posted some pics and it is definitely more easy on the eye on the inside. 

We went right at 11 am for lunch and they had hot, fresh food out and just kept putting more and more food out. For lunch and the price, they had a pretty good choice.

The menu is unique, the decor is cool and the location is actually convenient.  Service was relatively prompt, though with a minor hiccup as there was a change in servers midway through our meal.

We started with the guacamole sampler which was excellent.  We had the traditional, goat cheese and pineapple varieties.  All were great and everyone in my party agreed.  Our only criticism would be that the guac lacked some salt.

Along with the guac we had salsa, which we unfortunately had to pay $2 for.  Though, it was worth it as the salsa tasted great.  Packed a mild punch with the habanero pepper being subtle, yet appropriately portioned.  

For the main meal I had the chongo taquito which was basically grilled peppers and portobello mushroom strips served with a cream sauce and fresh corn tortiallas.  The taquitos tasted great, especially with the cream sauce. 

So why am I giving this place 4 stars instead of 5?  First, I feel like you shouldn't have to pay for salsa, no matter how great it is.

It is one of the cutest little diner-ish restaurant surrounded by the trees and acres of land.

I must say, until last night, I had the assumption that this place is a restaurant...you know, like Cracker Barrel and such.  But It is pretty much as casual as the Joe's real bbq which gives more character to the place.  After all, real bbq should be done self-serve style :)

My bf tried the Fontina Burger and I had the Baby back ribs with Mango milkshake.  (note:  Mango milkshake is limited time only so you should try it NOW)  We got our pager and waited maybe around 20min?...yeah, it was a little long but it's all good.  We were enjoying the nice, calm breeze outside.  

The food was great!  We were a little skeptical since we didn't really have a wonderful time at Joe's real bbq.  But the baby back ribs were very tender and juicy with great flavor.  The winner though was the Fontina burger.  The little hint of pesto did the trick we think.  The fries...we preferred the regular fries over the sweet potato.  It tastes wonderful the first few bites but afterwards, you kinda feel like you had enough...you know?

The way the Free Stamp got here and the controversy it created are only mildly interesting.  What really stands out is that Cleveland chose to site and leave the sculpture where it is.  Even if it's a mistake, it shows some major maturity on the city's part, something that is generally in very short supply, at least politically.

Unicorn is a solid pub, but as it has been mentioned nothing extraordinary! The space is huge, and I'd guess you could have a good time here on the crowded night if the young people of Yonge and Egg went out in their own 'hood more often. 
There have been live bands when I've visited (mostly on Thursdays), and the music has consisted of the typical pub cover band. 

Food-wise Unicorn is a cut above the average pub grub, and they actually carry a few authentic Irish items. That being said I usually go for wings (1/2 price on Tues) or nachos. The burgers are MASSIVE to the point of falling apart, which isn't necessarily a good thing! There is also a daily 'happy hour' which discounts all appetizers before 7pm or so.

It was a Sunday night and pretty dead so we were seated right away. The bar area is nice but we opted for a table. It had nice views overlooking the lake BUT, anyone that knows Ocotillo knows that smell is NOT so nice! Even with the misters on, it's a hundred degrees outside. I'm not sure why they kept the large patio doors open. So anyway, the atmosphere was great. Candles lit and dim lighting. Could be very romantic and posh but, instead of Bocelli or Sinatra they were playing Smashmouth and Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was so ""off"" for this type of establishment. What made it even more awkward, was our waitress kept dancing and signing near us like we were in a club. Not very professional for such a nice place but again, whatevs. The wine list was not impressive at all. In fact, we both had a really hard time deciding because there was so little to pick from. I mean, I've seen a couple of these bottles at Target, come on. Since you can order by the glass, we did since buying a bottle of something they had was just not going to be an option. 
 I ordered the chicken vodka penne. My friend ordered the Godfather pizza and we had a Caesar salad. Right away when the food came out, we both kind of looked at each other surprised and he said to me, ""Uh, that was fast. There's no way they cooked that pasta just now"" I agreed. The pasta sauce was great but the chicken was dry and I kept thinking, it was like it was made for something else and they just cut up and tossed it in my penne. The salads were delish though! I had a couple bites of his pizza. It was pretty good too.

While standard breakfast fare was certainly available, the menu including the Quiche du Jour , Sourdough Waffles and Croque Madam. I went for an Omlette with sausage, button mushrooms & comte.

The first time I ate here, I had the Fontina Burger, and was quite underwhelmed.  I also had the date shake, which had barely any date in it.  I didn't want to write the place off, however, since Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite restaurants.

This time, I went with the hot dogs: Carolina and Sonoran.  The Carolina dog sounded pretty good, with its pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and slaw toppings.  It was decent, but not as awesome as I thought it'd be.  The franks seemed to be decent quality, and the buns were nice.  If you get a dog, this is probably the best option.

Now, I knew going in that the Sonoran Dog would not be an authentic Sonoran dog.  Sour cream?  Really?  But I tried it anyways, hoping it would at least be good, even if not a Sonoran Dog.  It was underwhelming; seriously, guys, at least make it spicy.  If it doesn't even have that in common with a real Sonoran Dog, why is it called that?  A Sonoran Dog has pinto beans, bacon, mayo, mustard, pico de gaullo, tomatillo sauce, is served on a bolillo roll, and is served with a grilled hot pepper.  You can't just slap some bacon and beans on a hot dog and call it a Sonoran Dog.  This should be a crime.  This is a blatant affront to all of the hardworking Mexican immigrants who, through their efforts, created Arizona's finest contribution to the culinary landscape.

The outdoor seating is nice.  That's really about it.  They don't even have the awesome homemade root beer or lemonade they have at Joe's Real BBQ. Skip this, and stick with Joe's other restaurants.",2012-11-18 19:13:54

Ordered the mac and cheese, beef brisket spaghetti, and then split the poutine with a friend. All were alright but nothing spectacular. I liked the hint of spicy on the mac and cheese, but wish it had a bit more of a saucy base. The spaghetti was your regular tomato sauce style pasta dish. The poutine had a decent portion of bacon and cheese curds, and fries were not too salty. 

At 4.95 per dish, you get what you pay for - and probably more. The portions are pretty filling (one friend ordered 3 and was stuffed afterward) and the menu has a good range of items. If the line is manageable I would definitely return for some budget eats.",2017-08-03 04:30:40

I've been a fan of this place for awhile and absolutely love eating here when I'm craving salt & pepper chicken, shumai and house noodles.

I lived on Guam all my life, and I hoped to find more than a handful of places to eat really authentic Asian food. Most of them are Americanized to fit the pallets here, but I think this place keeps it as close as you can get to what I'd eat back home.  The dishes I mentioned earlier are definitely something to try when you go here.  They're all I order because it's that good.  I love the extreme saltiness, sour, and sweetness you get from their sauces and spices.  That's what it's all about.

As for the service, it's normal to me.  I'm used to them not smiling and kissing my ass because that's not how it's done in any restaurant I visited throughout Asia or back home.  If you want them to cater to you hand and foot, visit a five star restaurant.  Despite their ""attitudes"", they serve quickly, clear the table as you eat, and drink refills come quick, too.

The first time was after opening night, so it was likely around 22:00 when we arrived. It was busy. I ended up reserving a table for us by plopping our coats and my purse on our three comfy chairs. I didn't do any ordering, but I wanted the iced lavender drink with honey.

Both my friends came back about fifteen minutes later. The lineup was long. An older man with his date joked that he'd come sit with me. I had a snappy comeback which made them both laugh.

They came back with my beverage. They also got the following:
- Petit fours, consisting of chocolate mousse, lemon, chocolate strawberry cups, and pistachio
- Strawberry rhubarb almond cake
- Vanilla strawberry cheesecake

They joined me at the table. We chatted and shared all the decent, scrumptious desserts. Like the first time at this cafe in Rock Hill, everything I had was divine. They weren't overly sweet. They were perfect.

It was during our stay at this cafe that we booked our tickets to the ballet the following afternoon. My friend did the booking and I offered to charge it to my credit card. Ah, teamwork!

After the matinee show on Sunday, we went for a late lunch first, and then decided to hit this cafe again. We thought of having a movie night at the hotel, and indulge in pastries and more together.

I was fortunate to participate in selecting goodies for us. Collectively, we got the following:
- Bread pudding
- Napoleon
- Two key lime tarts
- Dark chocolate raspberry tart

I am not a huge fan of the Napoleon to begin with. One of my friends ordered it, which was huge. I ended up being stuck with the remaining piece after they both headed home. I loved everything else. Nothing was left, except the bread pudding. I actually brought it back to Markham and ate it! It had chocolate mixed in, which was so yummy.

This bakery has a cafe in Rock Hill, SC; and another in Atlanta, GA. The remaining locations are in Charlotte, which is another good reason to return for a future visit.

If you are ever in Charlotte, I recommend coming here to either chat, have a cup of coffee, or get dessert to take with you. It's all good no matter what you do.

We were debating over a place to eat in the Strip District and I offered up DeLuca's as I have had decent experiences there before and there is always a line out the door waiting for seats.  We arrived at around 9:15 and walked right into the restaurant and were seated in the upstairs portion.  The inside of this place is nothing special and looks like many other diners.  They did have a t shirt from man v food (circa 2006) on the wall above us.

For my breakfast I decided to start off with a coffee which was poured within seconds of ordering and delivered to our table.  Then after a few minutes of deliberating over the huge menu I ended up going with the Huevos Rancheros for my breakfast.  After ordering our waitress disappeared and I am pretty sure that I never saw her again until we had to ask another waitress to get her for our check.  That meant that after about 10 minutes of waiting with an empty cup of coffee, I ended up helping myself to the pot that was sitting nearby.  I never did get a third cup which would have been nice.  Anyways, after a reasonable amount of time our food made it out to our table and my Huevos Rancheros looked pretty good.  The egg was sunny side up and whenever I cut through it, the yolk dripped nicely onto the tortilla, cheese, salsa and chorizo underneath it.  It tasted decently enough although I would have personally liked it quite a bit spicier.  After I was about half way through my my meal the avocado that was supposed to come on it materialized to our table.  It was maybe 1/4 of a total avocado cut into 4 very small slices which were quickly gone.  Whenever my family and I had finished our meals we proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to come to our table.  Finally giving up on that we asked another waitress to ask our waitress for the bill.  She did and about 10 minutes later and after again asking our waitress for the bill, we were able to pay.  The sad thing is that we were trying to get out of there and there was a huge line of people outside waiting to get in.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably avoid coming here in the future.  While the food was decent tasting I found it to be overpriced and our service was just miserable.",2014-12-31 02:36:11

Thus, I decided to go here with a friend because I wanted to go to a new place and she wanted to try their sea salt cheese topping. I personally did not try it because I do not like cheese, but I might comeback here and try it since a lot of people have been raving about it. 

I ordered the grapefruit with lime drink because I love grapefruit and wanted something refreshing. I told them that I wanted it sweetened because of my bad experience at another location I went to yesterday, but the lady informed me that it shouldn't taste bitter and that the regular sweetness level should be okay. I was glad that I trusted her because my drink came out just the way I wanted. The first sip tasted like green tea with a hint of the grapefruit and lime. I wanted a delicious and refreshing drink and that is exactly what I got. My drink was also not diluted and there was a good amount of ice to keep my drink chilled. 

Overall my experience here was awesome. The ladies behind the counter were very friendly and personable. They took the time to explain their menu and even taught my friend how to enjoy her drink with the cheese foam thing! It sounded complex with drinking it at a 45 degree angle, etc., but I could tell they wanted their customers to have the best experience possible. I would totally comeback here to try their drink and the cheese foam thing! I'm so glad I was able to enjoy this delightful little gem in the desert.

Also for customer service, the cashier was not friendly and majority of the works were talking so much to each other, they forgot that the customer can see them and hear them. They got busier and still the workers were still talking to each other like there was no one there. Don't get me wrong there were some of the workers that were talking but still was working at the same time, which I was appreciate it. They were also other workers just standing around doing nothing while they go busy. I will probably never go back to this place because I can't stand the amount of a ""large"" cup and how some of the works acts like they are too good to work there.

Looked at the menu, it was pretty pricey and I noticed they had Spaghetti Bolognese so I thought it may be good to see how it fares with my challenge.

Challenge lost.  I've had much better spaghetti elsewhere.  If this was my only dish, I would've given this restaurant a 2-star max.  However, my friend N got the Napolitan and I had a couple of bites from it. 

It was AWESOME!  So much so I gave this restaurant two more stars just from those two bites.  I can't wait to try it out again and probably give this restaurant the 5-stars it deserves.  For that quality, $10 is not too bad.

To finish off our meal, we got a crepe with fuji apple, pecans and vanilla ice cream.  It was good, but not nearly as good as the Napolitan.

As a bonus I also got to learn the history of the Napolitan from N.

Anyway, I don't think I will order it for a while as they had so many other specials on their board that i want to try out and the Napolitan is on the menu so I can probably get it at any time.  Probably when J is back to Toronto I'll let her try it out with me.",2011-09-14 02:08:42

This Market was established in 1908, though there are folks claiming to have pictures showing it was running back in the 1800's too.  It's still in it's original building, with the paint fading softly all around the edges of the building.  Just as in the old tradition, they try to be a general market - but for a new generation.

Saddles, tack, spurs...oh, and of course, coffee"".  When I was there last, we left with a sack of homemade chipotle rolls, homemade granola, ice cream, 2 home grown organic avocados - and about an hour of entertainment for my mom as she ooo'd and aahh'd over the antique bookshelves holding stuff like Hormel chili in one row and stacks of wine in another.  

The flyer she gave my mom - who was oh so obviously new to the place, showed pastries, dog treats and deserts are coming soon.  Of course, the girl working the counter is the daughter of the family that's owned it for the last 30 years or so.  And she told me their semi-long term plans are to turn their ""back room"" that currently holds the antiques into a restaurant.

The food was authentic Italian; from the properly cooked (hint Americans take al dente WAY too far) and salted pasta, to the locally source ingredients, to the serving potions.  In addition, there were a few other authentic touches that brought back found memories of osteria's throughout Italy, such as serving cokes and water in glass bottles and the bread sticks in a package.

Overall, the service is friendly and efficient, although their attention to detail has been so-so the times I have been.  Also, given the unique niche that this place is trying to fill, a bit more initiative from the wait staff could go a long way you make newcomers feel welcome.

Everything is vegetarian, or vegan, and many items can be gluten free.
The patio is very nice.
The presentation.  Your dish looks like a little garden party.

The Bad:
Service.  Fresh is in complete commune with nature.  They just let the wind blow your server over to you on its own accord.  If you order a salad, they will grow it for you.  If you go for lunch, order dinner.
Food is assembled, not prepared.  A bowl is rice, with sauce on top, with raw beg on top of that, with nuts on top of that.  They may as well give you all of these things on separate plates.  There is absolutely no integration of flavours.  

The Ugly:
The price is outrageous.  A bowl of rice, and salad will run you $13.  If this were any other restaurant you would be able to get a burger, or half chicken plus rice and salad for $13.  Here, you get the sides, no main.  Worse, if you get a burger (falafel on a bun), you don't get any sides.

At first my wife wasn't going to get one because she's really ticklish, especially her feet. I told her she should at least give it a try and she relinquished. We both signed up for an hour massage.

My masseuse had a cold or something. She kept coughing and left a couple of times to finish her coughing jag. When she left I could hear her spit up phlegm (yuck!). I did not, however, hear her run water/wash her hands (yuckier!). That was a definite turn-off.

My wife really liked her masseuse, other than the fact she answered her cell during the massage. My wife was completely relaxed afterward and was definitely glad she opted to get the massage.

The massages were about 50% feet and 50% the rest of the body. When my masseuse worked on my feet I could definitely tell that they needed a massage, and she did a good job. I didn't like when she massaged my face. This is going to sound weird, but I don't know how else to describe it: the face massage made me feel like a mouse.

Sure, I was a frantic, overprotective dog mom the first time we dropped him off but my fears were quickly dissolved when I realized the quality of this facility.

The day care section is divided into a 'big dog' and 'little dog' section. The dogs are closely watched at every moment to ensure safety for all. The employees are very attentive and know everyone's names by heart (it's the little things, after all.) Also, this place is crate free, meaning you don't have to pay extra for your dog to play with others all day. They are only crated if being fed a meal or if they are being boarded overnight. 

Megan, the owner, is great and very reassuring even to neurotic pet owners like myself. The first time we boarded Dexter for a long weekend, we called twice a day to check on him. She was kind and patient, explaining to us during each call that he was having the time of his life. 

Dexter's visits are now a weekly occurrence and one I know he looks forward to. These trips are mutually beneficial as he not only has fun but is completely exhausted afterwards, giving his parents a much needed night off.

Not only that, but the bracelets to get in are only for a few hours, whereas with Makutu's Island you can be there as long as you want. Their prices to get in are a lot cheaper given you can be there for hours.

So a bit of credit for opening here in Toronto. In terms of the food, the Peking duck was good, definitely different from the ones in Toronto but...

The bad: ... it's still not at the golden standard that you would get from 'Beijing'. The waiter notified us that while this was still good, due to Canadian standards this is definitely not the same duck you would be having in Beijing, there is more 'fat' in the ones you find in Beijing (Which is unfortunately not approved in Canadian standards). Nonetheless, you are still getting a premium duck, possibly the best in Toronto, however....

The ugly: the price is something you will have to pony up for. I highly recommend 1) come with a group ($118 for a duck...), 2) while the rest of the menu is good (e.g. The duck heart is amazing), it is fairly expensive - don't come to eat a buffet or else you will be having quite the bill!, 3) get someone who has eaten at this restaurant before or knows Beijing type of food (this will at least give you Beijing's specialty food).

Other thoughts: decor is nice, even though it's still soft opening there is a huge wait (tons of people even on a weekday past dinner time hour), free parking on hotel lot level 5!!! (There is limited space in front of the restaurant), expect wait times so better to reserve.

While that probably says a lot right there, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anywhere near where I like my Mediterranean fare to be. There was nothing special or memorable to it, and it was sort of overall quite bland. Possibly because it's not Persian or Greek or Moroccan, but some sort of Americanized, averaged version of all the widely varied cuisines that get lumped into ""Mediterranean"". It's a sort of ""health-food-ified"" Frankenstein that has all the right parts of delicious Mediterranean food, but they just aren't working quiiiiite right.

Food alone would give it 3 stars, though. I never feel oogy after eating it, and it is what it advertises.

What knocks it down to two, is the fact that every time I come in, I'm treated very rudely. One of my co-workers with a stamp loyalty card who was buying another co-worker who forgot his wallet in his desk lunch tried to get two stamps, and was actually yelled at.

High tea here is so much better than Windsor Arms... First of all, they present you with this pretty box that lights up with your tea selection inside. There are 9 individual smaller containers within the big box that contain different types of tea and you can open up the lid to smell the scent of the tea. On the lid of the big box displays the names and description of each tea.

We started off with a quiche and then the savoury tray of high tea was served which included salmon croissant sandwiches and some other stuff i dont remember (look at the pictures i uploaded) but it was just GOOD! The sweet tray came next and I was so happy that they served macarons! Windsor Arms didn't serve any macarons so that was a huge disappointment. So the sweet tray included some typical stuff like very fluffy scones, red velvet cupcakes, a miniature tiramisu, minature eclaire and such.

One other thing i really like about high tea at Ritz is the presentation of the food. They serve the food in this round shelf-like thing and neatly organize the food on each level. One of the main reasons why I like this place, i know this is going to sound stupid, but the presentation of the food. A lot of other high tea places present the food on a tower with a plate on each level and food just scattered on it. I hate that! It makes the food so unattractive and unappetizing.

You could tell he knew her personally) who was sitting at the bar that she charges more for certain drinks because they're annoying to make, and she will ""charge whatever she feels necessary"" if she feels like it. Good to know, hope I was charged the ""proper"" price for my bland martini... She was outwardly rude to me for no reason. So that started our evening off poorly.

Having recently tried a few other Eastern European restaurants, I can honestly say this is one of the better ones, yet. I mean, just the feta dip is mind-blowing. Seriously? The warm, homemade bread is delicious and the stuffed cabbage, although a little bit different than what my Mom used to make, is really, really good.

Then a certain caution sweeps over me since so many dim sum places around the valley don't even come close to those found in other cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. So when a friend of mine and local ice cream guru, Helen Yung from Sweet Republic, told me about a new dim sum joint that reminded her of Hong Kong, I was elated to try it as soon as possible.

Phoenix Palace is quickly becoming a jack of all trades sort of restaurant. During the week they have seafood and Chinese buffets, a full menu with free delivery, and on the weekends rolling cart dim sum as well as a take out BBQ section. While carts only roll on the weekends, dim sum can be ordered any day of the week off of a smaller menu. We came just for the weekend cart dim sum, the BBQ section in the front of the restaurant looked amazing. In the window wrapped onto stainless steels hooks were selections of whole roasted duck, pork spare ribs and roasted chicken. I haven't seen a display like this one since being in Chinatown in San Francisco a few months back, very impressive. Come early or call ahead if you want to enjoy a roast duck to-go, when we left the display was pretty much wiped out.

Walking into the Phoenix Palace you'll immediately notice that you're not in Kansas anymore, the clientele is mostly Asian who have very discerning palates. You know you're in the right place when the target market is ethnic and not American. No worries about communication break down, the staff speaks English, even if it is a little broken. Though all you really need are your senses to guide you through the dim sum experience. After being sat, the carts will start rolling by your table to peddle their vast variety of dumplings. Each cart person will open a steam basket for you to take a look inside and along with a brief explanation, usually consisting of only one word, they stamp your tally card and move on. The carts don't come in any sort of order so just have fun and order away. If something looks even remotely good go ahead, it's really inexpensive.

One of the main difference between Phoenix Palace and the other dim sum restaurants, is the fact that not only do they offer 75+ different items, but here it's not only fresh but made in house. One of the carts that come about is a fry cart which at first seemed unusual. It's a stainless steel ride with a built in cook top where some items are crisped and heated table side which made perfect sense after one bite. In all of the places I've had dim sum, here and in other cities, I have never seen or heard of this before. Helen told me that she hadn't seen something like that since having dim sum in Hong Kong. If Helen is impressed, I'm blown away! We started with an order of Green Leek Gow ($3.15), with a translucent skin showing a silhouette of diced leeks and chopped shrimp, then crisped up on either side for a textural symphony. We also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Bun ($3.15) which had a slightly crisped edges filled with tender chopped pork, each bite was simply sublime. These were so good we ordered an additional plate of those chubby meat filled pillows.

The standards are done extremely well here, such as the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($2.15), as well as the baked version ($2.15) with its covering of sweet sticky glaze. If you've never experienced a BBQ Pork Bun in either incarnation, you really should. This is the all about savory, salty and sweet, dip in some chili paste for an added spicy dimension. Chinese Broccoli ($5.25) is slightly bitter, slightly sweet and has a crunchiness that pairs well with the softer noodle dishes like the Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($3.15). Long sheets of rice noodles are filled with sliced tender beef, rolled and then steamed. When delivered to your table, a lightly sweetened soy sauce is poured over the top. Shui Mai ($2.15) is as tender and flavorful as it was meant to be, porky and delicious.

Dessert dim sum is as much fun as its savory counterpart. Sesame Balls ($2.15) filled with sweetened red bean paste, surrounded by sticky rice, then rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried were pretty much a crowd pleaser. The Snow Bun ($2.15) was a new one that I've never seen or tasted before. A cloud of pure heaven filled with creamy custard, served warm, blew away any doughnut that's graced my lips. I also ordered a box of them to-go so they could be enjoyed again later. The tall and billowy Brown Sugar Rice Cake ($2.15) reminded me more of a yellow cake though was very good, hot and fresh out of the steam basket.

There aren't too many places where you can try so many different textures and flavor in one sitting. So it really is an experience to have dim sum with a close group of pals because food always seems to bring us just a little bit closer.",2009-04-18 02:14:50

This place is also the only place I know that offers mini boba here in the Phoenix metropolitan area. I used to go to this place often when I was a child but never really yelped about it because I was probably 11 years old at that time. Now, since all the other places are booming, Boba Tea House became less popular. I'm just sad that I couldn't trade my stamped card to get my free drinks many years ago. The shop even opened before I came to the United States.

Order? The menu is adequate, not a lot and not too little. One downside is that they don't list the price for the Supersize cup so I honestly don't know how much it costs. I only know I paid $5 for a milk tea with mini boba. 

Service? Lightning fast! This place has the fastest service ever! I ordered and within 10 seconds, here comes my boba drink

Taste? It doesn't taste that great to be honest. My drinks always tasted normal. I can't discover any epiphany drinking this. There isn't any extraordinary about the drinks. There isn't any ""specialty"" drink that mesmerizes you. They probably use powder for flavor.

Writing a review on The District's family events such as the 'Cheers to Chocolate' to Yelp about events was not so family friendly.  Not the Districts fault, however we got there early to take pix before the event for this Yelp review & this security agency there were the rudest ever.  In particular this one rude woman, who acted like we were not going to pay for a ticket.  I told her we would when it was 7pm, when the event started, but with her pissy attitude maybe it wasn't worth it.  She works for Universal Protection.  We walked through to the end to see if it was even worth it at 6:30pm since we've already eaten at all of the restaurants there regularly so what's the hype about.  I don't have kids so if it's a kids event, no thanks.  It looked like a family event, so I'd rather go to Bella Vita & kick back than pay to be hassled.  The manager of the security group was named Bobby Nickey & I'd say if the event had started already, then come talk to me, but we had 30 minutes to decide so why are you following me around after I clearly said I'm taken pix for my Yelp review?  Do you speak Yelp?  Anyways, I'd give a zero on events there w/ that kind of security so bored that they have nothing better to do than follow a girl around taking pictures.  Lol get a real life.

Anyways that's my rant on events there, not worth, especially when I saw a lot of people w/o wristbands walking around before the event not being harassed.  Strange.",2016-09-17 12:45:44

The next course was a wonderful lobster salad, this had large chunks of lobster with fennel, frisee, and orange segments--this course was a beautiful reminder of the summer, fresh, light and full of flavors. The next course was a special pan seared scallops with a wonderful Beurre blanc sauce and topped with carrot and asparagus slices.  Very tender scallops and the sauce was a great compliment to this course.  Chef Charlie presented a new treat for the next course, he called it a bone marrow Twinkie--it was comprised of a brioche slice and stuffed with a bone marrow butter then topped with some vegetables and sliced beef.  This was a very rich dish and very enjoyable.  The main course was a wonderful rack of lamb, this was spiced with Greek seasonings--cumin, garlic, parsley, and oregano--on top of mashed potatoes and tomatoes.  The main course was presented well and had some wonderful flavors, and the lamb was done perfectly.

My moo shu pancakes? Tortillas. I'm not kidding, actual tortillas. Not rice paper, or won ton wrappers. Tortillas. And as I opened up the box with the actual veggies in it, it compleatly broke and smashed all over my carpet.

We carried out some online research and contacted Howard Air to set up an appointment.  Tina took my call and kindly set up an appointment for the same day which was a pleasant and unexpected surprise.

Bryan, the tech that was assigned to us was friendly and professional.  He did an outstanding job performing the standard service call. He took multiple photos of our A/C/Heat Pump unit which is located up on the roof of our home.  He then showed me the photos of several components of our A/C system and fully explained their function and why they needed to be replaced in order for our system to run more efficiently. The price quoted was very competitive as well.

We gave Bryan the green light to proceed and he replaced the components, added additional Freon and even kindly washed our permanent filter (he explained how important it is to keep this filter clean and to do this each month to ensure unrestricted airflow) and even installed a ptrap in our condensation pipe without charge. 

Bryan was asked about several photos of our A/C unit that were taken by our inspector and there were several items that he said did not need to be worked on at this time as they were actually in good condition.  I appreciate Bryan's integrity and this reflects well not only on him, but on Howard Air too.

Bryan also immediately emailed us our invoice when we paid with our credit card. We appreciate that paperless option for our records.

I'm not sure if it was the time in which I visited, on a Saturday just before dinner time, but this place was pretty empty.  So that's sort of a bonus, right?

Anyway, I also noticed that quite a few items did not have the price listed, plus there were some misplaced items.  If you're unfamiliar with the layout, finding something specific can be a bit overwhelming/slightly frustrating.

Walking into the place definitely gives you a wow impression. They have this huge glass case that presents their dishes and portion sizes. The atmosphere was spacious and calm. It was almost a full house. However it didn't sound noisy as I thought it would be. When you order you stand in line and they give you a pager. You have the option to grab some tempura before paying. When we went, there was not much left. There weren't any rice rolls either, which was something I was looking forward to try as well. 

My boyfriend and I ordered, Seafood Tomato Cream Udon, Nabeyaki and Pork Belly Bao. 
After ordering my boyfriend and I found a seat. We waited for the pager to buzz. 1st time it did, it was JUST my seafood dish that had been given. Lady at the register told me to keep the pager for our next order. Second order was delivered by them. Then a few minutes later, the pager buzzed. It was the Pork Belly Bao. The deliver of service was a bit confusing and all over the place.. I didn't really like the idea of walking across the room to grab my order one by one. Usually places that have pagers, your food is given to you all at once. Don't get me wrong, the staff was friendly and nice. Just the coordination was a little off. 
Going into the food, the quality of the Udon was perfect. It wasn't over cooked. It was chewy. Which I enjoyed. Although, my dish wasn't the greatest. Would I order it again? No. It tasted like the tomato sauce I would get at the store. The seafood wasn't fresh for sure (not that im saying they said it was). I serve at a seafood restaurant that serves fresh seafood, so it was easy to distinguish. My boyfriend got the Nabeyaki and he wasn't that fond of it either. Didn't stick out from the other places we had udon with. The broth didn't stand out to be exact. 
Third, the pork belly bao was definitely something we decided we'd order again. It was full of flavor. The bun was PERFECTION! I would come back for it.",2018-04-14 02:54:04

The surrounding area isn't the greatest.  It isn't as close to the Oakland area eateries, as say, the Wyndham and Holiday Inn hotels also in Oakland, but I'm very happy with the hotel itself.  The rooms are reasonably sized and clean, and have free wireless internet.  There's free breakfast in the lobby every morning, which includes cold items like cereal and pastries, but also a rotating selection of hot foods like eggs or French toast.  I believe they also have boxes if you're in a rush and want to take breakfast to-go.  The food's not fantastic, but it's one less meal to have to worry about on your travel budget.

The hotel shuttle is super helpful if you've come to Pittsburgh without a car, especially since taxis are a rare sight on the streets in Oakland.  It'll take you anywhere within a 2 mile radius, and come pick you up, too.

The staff here is very friendly--I've had a much warmer reception here than at many other higher-end hotels.  When I mentioned I was visiting Pitt, the woman at the front desk promptly pulled out a photocopied map of Pitt's campus, showed me where the hotel was relative to the school, and gave me the map to keep.",2009-05-13 22:37:44

Song Cooks is expensive compared to the owls and other smaller Korean joints in Peel but it's worth it if you care about authenticity and flavors. 

Their menu also incorporates many items yoy don't see anywhere else such as Military Soup, intestines soup,  ginseng stuffed chicken soup and a bunch more. 

I've had their pork bone soup and bibimbap which I'm sure along with bulgogi is among their hottest sells. The pork bone soup is not super salty and has a very aromatic and flavorful broth. The table cooking portion is slightly smaller than owl but the individual size is the same. 

Their rice is expensive but they give you awesome options from white to brown to brown with barley and/or beans. It's a few bucks extra which is annoying but you got to do what you got to do. 

Spicy chicken table cooking duk galbi actually tastes like it should,  spicy and sweet and salty. Although I miss the pizza cheeses they used to throw on in SK.

Their side dishes are also really well done and not overly salty or old like other places. 

This is only skimming their huge menu with tons of offerings. 

All in all I'd deem this the#1 place in mississauga for authentic plentiful Korean dishes that takes me all the way back to Gwangju.

But you know what words I don't mind hearing? ""Unfortunately we don't have that information."" You know what other words I don't mind hearing? ""Apologies for the mistake. That's not our usual practice.""

I've visited this store 3 times. Only 3 times. First time nothing unusual happened. I walked around. Purchased a few things. I guess things get complicated when you ask questions. 

2nd trip (about 3 weeks ago): I returned some items and one of the items could not be found because I wasn't charged for it. Not a big deal but it took them forever to resolve the matter, calling over about 4 people to take care of this and figure it out; when this could have been finished after I left. Why? I had somewhere to be and I believe my actions and words were pretty obvious. ""That's okay"" Checking the time on my phone... looking like I'm in a hurry. Again, ""that's okay""

3rd Trip: I went after Christmas to get some things for next years Christmas. Who doesn't love a good sale? I wanted some blinking lights and asked the sales person on the floor if they have the blinking lights or how do I find them. She looked for some for maybe 5 seconds, gave up and then told me I could pull the lights out of the boxes, plug them in a socket nearby to see which ones perform this operation.... are you serious??? I realize it's not her job to know about every product, but the LEAST she could have done was say, ""unfortunately, we're unsure of how the lights run"" or ask someone else who works there to check on this... I don't know. I'm not asking too much. I've worked retail before and I got cranky sometimes, especially as a teenager, but hell it's my job to give an adequate response. You may not have the answer, and that's fine but plug in all the different lights?? Really lady??? 

To top it off, the same lady who told me to plug in all the lights to test, told me the ornament storage boxes were also included in the 50% sale. Cool. Make my way to the register to check out and the lady at checkout says the ornament boxes aren't included in the sale. I told her the lady on the floor told me they were. Shes says, ""they're not"". No sorry or who told you this. Smh... customer service is clearly not on their priority list. I guess it doesn't have to be. They know they're going to get customers in regardless. But don't let some other comparable big chain store open up with the same goods AND offer good customer service, because then At Home will be out of business.

I made a reservation for 7 pm, thinking it might be really busy. When I arrived a little early, the place looked like it was just opening. There was a lone man sitting in the middle of the dining room whom I thought was a staff member finishing his shift, and a few people occupying the banquettes. I took the back banquet, and waited for my friend, keeping company with a tequila caesar, that was tasty, but felt like a watered down version of my empty belly favourite.

When my friend arrived we ordered a bottle of white, the calamari, a thin crust pizza with guincale, leek and gorgonzola and a linguine dish with mushroom and lemon.


The calamari was nice-- very crispy with a slightly spicy marinara sauce and each piece was stabbed on it's own little spike attached to a wooden board. Props for cool presentation.

The pasta was wonderfully al dente and the sauce had a creamy yet identifiable lemon flavour. Mushrooms could have been a better seasonal choice being that it's May and there are lots of wild ones growing. I think they were simple creminis.

Pizza was tasty, but this not a great crust. It's impossible to cut and the part that holds the toppings was super soggy. The topping combination was nice, but they all slid off then we tried to cut slices and pull the pizza. Definitely not my favourite in the city.

Service was super efficient and our server was friendly, offering her favourites from the menu when we asked. Our wine and water glasses were never empty, but curiously, the restaurant was.

During our dinner two more tables came in, but this is not an intimate space. With the warehouse ceilings and sprawling space between the front bar, chef's table and the dining room, it felt very empty for a Thursday night in downtown Toronto and very different from the Yelp Party! 

I don't think I'd come back to Strada 241. Pizza is definitely better at Libretto and the pasta at Enoteca Sociale eclipses Strada's for a comparable price. If I'm craving carbs, this won't be my place.",2013-05-24 13:08:56

Being here before the pools open, however, is something else. I wish there was something else to do here, and would have loved it had Trump had an indoor pool with a huge resort-style pool outdoors. During the winter and spring the resort fee seems really absurd since the Trump is not a resort and business-oriented hotels do not charge a resort fee. The majority of guests here were part of business conferences at the nearby convention centers.

A definite plus, this hotel is very dog-friendly and unlike the other hotels on the strip, there wasn't a trace of smoke in the lobby. The parking situation is valet-only, which makes it easy to get around, but a pain if you're in a hurry since you could be waiting for 5-10 minutes.

We went up and down Butler street trying to find some grub, but all the kitchens of our usual spots were closed.  It was either beer for dinner or venture into unexplored late-night food territory.  We noticed Pizza Amore as we drove by but wrote it off as another ""probably only good while drunk"" pizza joint, until I decided to Yelp it.  4.5 stars?!  We had to give it a shot.

And, unlike some of the overrated Bloomfield pizza shops, it did not disappoint!  There were two major signs of competency that foreshadowed the tasty pizza to follow.  The first is that they were stretching, not rolling, the dough.  The second is that, while we had beers next door at Remedy while waiting for the pizza to be made, we overheard some other beer drinkers raving about how ""amazing"" the homemade meatballs at Pizza Amore were.  Totally out of the blue... this was their topic of conversation as we walked into the bar!  Good thing we had ordered meatballs on half of our pizza!

When we finally got the pizza, we were so pleasantly surprised at how much better it was than what we had expected based on the shop front.  The crust was very tasty, just the right mixture of chewiness and crispiness, and just the right tinge of sweetness.  The meatballs were indeed delicious, and they are in fact homemade (next time I'm trying the meatball hoagie).  The pizza did not make it home.  We ate the whole thing standing on the street and reflected on how we would be back.

Pizzuvio is great. The perfect blend of speed and delight that you could ask for, whether you go for lunch, a snack or dinner Pizzuvio does it right. You can pop in, grab a pie and run. You can sit down and enjoy a casual dinner without losing the quality. 

My colleagues and I stopped by for lunch, my arancino funghi was out within minutes and was hot and delicious and oozed the cheese, a lovely lava, when I cut it(check out the photo). Simply put, it's a ball rice cheese and mushroom fried to perfection and a perfect appetizer or addition to a salad. My diavola(photo) pizza came out moments after and was just great. Nice spice, delicious thin cut salami crisped just right. 

What I like best about Pizzuvio is that it's your ""italian style"" pizza that most people associate with upscale restaurants, but served quickly as a street style food. They've adopted the pay first, enjoy (shortly) after style that Gaucho Parilla has with the same tremendously on point delivery; Timely, tasty and fresh.  As far as pricing goes, it's pretty spot on considering portions and freshness of ingredients respectively; If you think it's expensive, have a $4 Peroni (they have beer and wine) and pipe down, Pizzuvio is on point.

Really simple but the sauce on the pork belly and the watermelon were perfect compliments. I could have eaten 12 more. 

Next were the dirty south nachos. I am personally not a fan of fried chicken skin I now know. The pimento cheese and pickled okra they were topped with were very good though. 

Korean BBQ wings...amazing. Truffle fries. Our server described as like crack. He was right. I was full as could be still picking at them.

First, the organizers learned from the chaos of last year, and have thus far managed to put on an outstanding event. The guest line up is amazing, the vendors have a lot of offerings, and the cosplay is outstanding.

i actually got my wisdom teeth out a couple of days before coming here so i settled w something soft; french toast . the bf had the ultimate hangover sandwich . 

my rating is slightly biased since im korean and absolutely loved the idea of kimchi sandwich for brunch . i dont really love kimchi per se, but when i was little, i used to love eating sauteed kimchi w bread . kinda weird, but it was my thing . taking a bite of that sandwich was a lot more than a bite of a sandwich . :)

my french toast was good but wasnt the best ive ever had . i really did like, however, of the idea of different toppings every week . oh, we LOVED the homefries . i think i secretly liked the homefries more than the french toast itself . and the sandwich .. oh the sandwich was absolutely delicious ! looking at the menu, my bf wasnt so fond of the idea of kimchi in a sandwich, but he ended up getting it anyways . he loved it . my brunch hater bf LOVED it !! i think this is the happiest ive seen him about brunch since the hoofs ! i did have a bite, had my mouth bleed and a piece of bacon stuck between the stitches, but it was worth it . haha :)

Since this store changed store manager it has gotten so much better. Pancho in the make ready is also always willing to fix the problem he also helped me with the issue. After this I really recommend this place to anyone that washes their cars on a weekly basis the fast pass is great and for a one month charge you can literally wash your car one a day every day.

1. The games are free. That is awesome assuming the place isn't too busy. They have a small, but decent, selection of arcade games to choose from including a Mortal Kombat game (FTW!!!). 

2. They have beer....said beer is decently priced. 

3. They have happy hour.... who doesn't like happy hour? 

4. Their staff are generally friendly. 

5. They have trivia night on Thursdays at 7 pm and it is free to play.

6. The Golden Banana..... a beer cocktail that is fabulous (think chocolaty beer mixed with fruity flavors....it sounds weird, but it' really good). 

7. The atmosphere is fun and their mural on the wall is fabulous!


Cons:

1. If they are busy, service is hard to come by. 

2. Most of their cocktails have been just ok.... I haven't come across any cocktails (save my beertail (?) discussed in the Pros) that I would order again off their specialty cocktail menu. 

3. The trivia is a 'Geeks Who Drink' trivia night, which is a bit less fun than the original trivia nights you can find in other bars (not really the bar's fault, but you know).

4. Their food is a bit lack luster. It's supposed to be sort of 'grimy' I guess...their menu has things like grilled cheese and tater tots and choco tacos on it. I tried their gordito and it was fine, but not something I would get again.

xPa8xnULK6Vcl6zMGub0Ug,VzlX5LJ7__pl6AaBWBiw9w,u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,4,8,8,6,"I just spent two weeks at The Flamingo while setting up and tearing down a convention and had the opportunity to stay in both the standard and the Go! rooms.  There is definitely a difference.

A standard room at The Flamingo is nice enough.  You can tell that the hotel has some years on it, but it's been refurbished enough to be on par with a Holiday Inn.  The furniture is recent, the linens are clean, the bathroom fixtures are old but they work, and the room is a bland shade of beige.  The people you see in the halls are either fellow conventioneers or retirees spending their kids' inheritance.

The Go! rooms at the Flamingo, on the other hand, are modern, and everything in them seems to be designed for you to Go! Have! Sex!  The mattress and linens are upgraded, the headboard is padded for your convenience, you'll find a chaise lounge in front of the window that's big enough for two, the drapes have bedside electronic controls, there's a nice Denon stereo system with an iPod dock and a 52"" plasma on the wall, and the bathroom has a tub and separate shower with jets in the wall along with a TV behind the glass in the mirror.

The Go! rooms are quite fun, and yes, they are well suited for what they seem to be designed for.  Our go room seemed a little cramped compared to the standard room, but I think that comes from enlarging the bathroom and building out the wall to make room for the larger closet and built-in entertainment center.  (Having a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains was nice, too).  You won't find too many drawers in the room or space for large suitcases, or much counter space in the bathroom... but you'll have much more fun in the Go! room when you're traveling with your SO that you won't care.  I liked this room as much as I liked mine at the Hard Rock.

As mentioned elsewhere, the Flamingo does put a $100/day security hold on your credit card for incidentals, so it's advised to check in with a credit card as opposed to a debit card.  Room rates are a decent value, and you can't beat the location on the center of the strip.  The monorail is the best way to get to the Las Vegas Convention Center, and the stop is close to one of the room tower's elevators.

Service was responsive when I had problems with the thermostat in my standard room and a burned out light bulb - they sent someone over within 10 minutes.  They do kick it up a notch in the Go section, with a phone message from the concierge when you check in and a music CD to set the mood of the room to play in the stereo system.  The pool here is one of the best in Vegas, although $8 for a Corona by the pool is outrageous.  You'll drink cheaper next door at O'Shea's or Bill's, as long as you don't mind that dingy downtown experience in the middle of the strip.

So, if you're here alone on business, cheap out in the standard room.  If you're here to get your swerve on, go directly to Go!",2009-04-27 14:46:49

Well we were in the mood for a burger and decided, months later, to try it again. I don't know if it just took them a while to get their shit together, but man was the quality improved.

1)Burgers were super juicy, slightly pink, just perfectly grilled, unlike the dry, puck-like things we were served the other times we came when it first opened.

2)Their onion rings are now on par with Ottawa's Works, just spot on, especially if you get the chipotle mayo to dip in, which actually has some kick to it unlike most.

3)The drink menu has expanded a bit, now have a few more options for gettin' boozy wit it.

Is it still expensive? Yes. Not some place I'd go too often, but if you're in the mood for something DIFFERENT, highly recommend, even if you've been before in the past. From what I can see, they've stepped it up huge.

The first time I had an ice cream and cookie sandwich was back when Bakerbots just opened. I was hooked. So when Home opened, one of the few late night bakeries in the area, I was excited! One of the masterminds behind Bakerbots is the same owner of Home so I knew I would have no concerns of their baked goods. And the fact that it's open late means I can work and enjoy ice cream into the late evening which I am most focused.

At $4 a half sandwich, it's one of the cheapest in the city and tastes just as good if not better. My favourite ice cream sammie combination is the mint chocolate and dark chocolate cookie. They just compliment each other so well. 

I have yet to try anything else, but I'm sure I will eventually.

I decided to take a few coworkers here after work the other day because they were craving sushi after our long day, and after that last experience, I know personally I would never be back. Not only did they forget three of the things we ordered at our table, but they sent us two rolls we never even ordered. The quality of the fish was variable and we could tell that the yellowtail was not fresh because of its distinct smell and taste. So disappointing that their miso soups came out late and at room temperature at best without tofu. Some of the baked rolls that we ordered came out with a huge amount of mayo that overpowered the taste of the content. One of the rolls, the dragon, came out with brown avocado slices... Completely lost my appetite after eating some of the yellowtail nigiri and seeing that... This place has definitely gained some mad popularity from the first time we visited, so maybe they just don't care for quality like they used to? but, my advice... they are not consistent with the quality of the fish, the service is friendly, but extremely slow and forgetful, and overall, for what you pay, this is one AYCE sushi place i will never come bring people back to, recommend, or visit in vegas.",2015-06-29 17:36:58

When I arrived, they walked me past a bunch of open tables to the table farthest in the back, right next to the constantly swinging kitchen door, and facing the table that was being used by the staff to fold napkins. If it were not for the fact that the busboy folding napkins had a great butt, I would have complained.

Later, when they found out that I am conducting one of the big shows in town, they offered to move me to a better table. I politely declined, (Too Late) but thought; ""Ya mean if you'd thought that I wasn't your average customer, you would have given me a reasonable table?"" Not good.

They advertise as ""Not your standard gringo Mexican food place"". But that's exactly what I found. The food was all very average. The tomatillo salsa that was served on my ""Enchiladas Suizas"" was the same that was served with the chips when I arrived. The chicken inside did not seem spiced or marinaded in any way. The tortillas were dull.

The margarita was good (made with fresh lime juice), but it was not ""the original"" margarita, as advertised. According to Hussong's history, the original was made with Damiana liqueur, which adds a slightly bitter, herbal flavor. Here, they substitute Cointreau, which is citrusy and very sweet - again, appealing to the average Gringo.

I've mentioned this before, but I'll bring it up again: Las Vegas is jam-packed with awesome Mexican restaurants - and most of them are dirt cheap. If you're gonna charge $16 for an enchilada, you'd better back it up with outstanding food; interesting drinks, and impeccable service.

The choices and delicious pictures posted by many make decision making that much harder.  Its not a good feeling when you have already skipped lunch after a 5 hour drive.  But finally, we found Gus.  The gem is that is tucked away that is no longer a hidden to many.

We called and made reservation for 8pm and were advised that we will be seated by the bar.  No biggy... We actually love seeing chefs in action and its actually really nice to be able to sit beside your partner and chat more intimately.

Our waitress did not keep us waiting one bit and went through the menu thoroughly despite how busy she already was.  Everyone really needs to themselves a favour and try their margarita.  The BEST I have had and I'm not even a margarita fan.  When the our kindest waitress attended to other patrons, we were not left hanging.  Chef David swiftly took our orders and he was nothing but friendly from start to end.

Blah blah blah... I need to talk about the food!  We were served with thick fresh bread and house made corn relish (please see Kris' review of the bread, Kris tells no lies).  We then started with the fois gras nacho and grilled octopus.  Be warned, these can easily be your main if you're not a big eater.  The fois gras was unique, it really is a fois gras and not a pâté.  So that's what fois gras tastes like! It did not take me long to finish this appy and I already feel the food coma coming. The grilled octopus did not disappoint either.  It was refreshing and really opens up your appetite.  

When the our lamb and steak arrived, we really weren't sure if we can finish the dishes.  The portion was generous but it is not the quantity but the quality that spoke volume about the two dishes.  The lamb was probably one of the best I have had.  It was perfectly cooked and served with a mountain of mint leaves coated in a sweet dressing.  Brilliant!  And if that doesn't fill you, there's roasted potatoes hidden underneath all the goodness.  Now let's talk steak.  We had it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly with a sear on the outside.  They were juicy and tender; what made this dish even better was the sliced potatoes and sandwiched in between are mushrooms.  Wow!  It almost stole the steak's thunder on this dish!

Stick a fork in us cause we were done after cleaning up these plates!  We would've loved to finish up the meal with some dessert and coffee but we were quickly falling into a food coma.  After we got the bill and ready to roll out, Chef Dave held us back to send us away with a complimentary chocolate cake to go!  By the time we got back to our hotel, we made just enough room devour the perfectly balanced chocolate cream cheese cake.

The kimchi was also too overpowering, I couldn't taste the lettuce or cilantro, in fact, the only way I was able to tell pork, chicken, and beef was from its texture and color.  The only taco that had any flavor other than kimchi was the egg and tofu.

The spot is small and casual with only enough seating for 20-30 people. The menu is small, but if you're looking for meat on a stick, you will find what you need. The majority of the menu is dedicated to yakitori, although they do have other items such as udons and meat/veggie bowls. I ordered the veggie skewer sampler, and my husband ordered scallop, lamb and salmon. The meat selection is wide, everything from chicken heart to squid! 

Our main concern was that they were a little heavy handed with the seasonings. My veggies were salty, and the scallop seasoning wasn't our preference. The scallops were baby-sized and a bit chewy, which was disappointing. I wouldn't say the serving size is generous, but then again, neither is the price tag I guess.

Service was kind. Young guys who seemed concerned about delivering good eats. I definitely want to go back to give their tasty beverage selection a sip.

That was not the case here, plenty of open sky and if you want a little shade you can always have a seat at the bar and enjoy the shade, drinks and fresh tacos. Did I forget to mention the DJ? The music was nice and added to the great experience I had here.

I will definitely make this a location to go back to on the strip and am happy to have gone there a second time. It felt more personable, more comfortable to meet others and have a good time.

Pizza crust was thin and slightly crispy, nearly perfect. The toppings were definitely fresh and very flavorful. The sauce was robust and slightly zesty without the cloying sweetness you find at other pizza joints.  The only criticism I had with it was that the toppings weren't that hot. I think next time I go, I'll ask for it to spend an extra minute or two in the oven to get the toppings hot and super melty.

Swaddee is hidden away in the corner of a plaza, but the inside decor does not disappoint. It's not too large and not too small. Rather, it's just the right size. The tables were simple. We had a one with a black cloth, an image centered in the middle, and a glass overlay but I was completely drawn to it. 

We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It had the right amount of spices and flavor as well as the right amount of heat. My main course was the pineapple curry (medium), which was just as incredible. It was a little hotter than medium, which was perfect and full of flavor. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the pineapple was fresh. For dessert, my friend ordered the coconut ice cream and I ordered the golden banana (banana and coconut in a spring roll). We ended up each taking half the banana and opening it like a spring roll and putting ice cream on top. Hands down this is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even if you dine alone at Swaddee, you *have* to order both. I'm not going to lie. I might come back here just for dessert.

There was a restaurant on Yonge near Dundas in downtown with the same name a couple of years ago. Are these the same people?
In Persian the food, which is their national dish, is called 'kabob' and not 'kebob.' Are these people actually Iranians or from a neighbouring country? It is probably a case of weak English. The plaza's name reads 'Leslie Center' instead of the correct 'centre' and they have something called 'yogurt and garlic,' which in fact should be 'yogurt and shallot.'

Whatever the case, I have found a new place that rivals Pardis, which is my favourite Iranian take-out place. Little House does have half a dozen tables, the ever tacky TV, etc for dine-in, but I was taking food out for dinner and was pleasantly surprised how delicious the food was. Moreover, for the price, which is cheaper than than most of the competition, there was neither a sacrifice in quality nor in portion size.
Most Iranian restaurants offer included salad with chelokabob. Here they offer soup or salad. The soup options are lentil or barley. Actually, I did not have a choice regarding soup or salad as they had run out of the latter. The lentil soup was tasty, but I am not convinced it is a good accompaniment to chelokabob.

My chelokabob (kabob and rice) was really delicious. The barg (sirloin) was a little overspiced, but satisfying. The koobideh (minced meat) was so good and tender and the chicken especially well marinated, soft and delicious. I am also sure all their different combinations are $2 or $3 cheaper than the other Iranian restaurants.

Based on the unavailability of salad, the slower service and a mess at the door where a whole bunch of ethnic newspapers were strewn and created a mess I want to give this place 3.5/5 because the employees were friendly and kind, the food was delicious and the portions generous.",2017-07-15 12:29:53

Seriously, how can chicken wings be so simple yet so delectable? Tangy, garlicky fall-off-the-bone perfection. My boyfriend and I ordered the ""Flintstones"" beef short rib as a main course. I remember reading on yelp that the portion is huge but we still both yelled when the server approached us with a GIANT platter that took up our entire table. The beef was so tender - no knife needed. Worth the splurge. My only criticism is I wish there were more vegetables and salad greens to balance out the richness of the beef. Needless to say we both barely made a dent in the dish and took most of it home and enjoyed it for not one but two more full meals. We also ordered the gravy frittes which were okay, a bit oversalted. The gravy was delicious.

They have really good clam chowder. I highly doubt this is a canned brand. Tastes like they built if from scratch.

My wife and I ordered the world famous grouper sandwich.  Unfortunately it was topped with American cheese.  Thick ole slice of American cheese, which kind of hijacked the taste... and we didn't much care for it.  The accompanying seasoned fries were the typical frozen restaurant style.

Family & I were more shocked at what actually just happened more than we were upset. But we understood, accidents happen. Not only did our server offer to pay out of pocket for appetizers or pay half our bill(we declined by the way, did not want him spending his own money), he told on himself to his manager who then came over to our table & also apologized. In the end, they compensated one free appetizer & charged us half the price of our entire bill which came out to be less than $20.

idd2cJ5uh5_kS6_F5ehj-Q,hxTvxWgPHS-OTEoZTncXRQ,F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,5,1,0,1,"I have been to this restaurant several times and have never had a bad experience. The first time I went, I got the tinga taquito, which is chicken. It was good, but I didn't think it was absolutely something to rave about. My boyfriend let me try his dish, the machaca, and I almost died when I ate it--it was that good. The flavors just pop out and I love it so much so I always get it every time I go there, even though my boyfriend tells me to try something new.

If you are going to be ordering taquitos, I would only go during happy hour (5-6:30 weekdays only), especially if you look at the menu ahead of time and know that's what you will be getting. Taquitos are half off, and classic margartias (no other flavors) are half off also (regular price is $8). Otherwise, I really believe it is too expensive. Happy hour is for the first floor only, and if you want a table you HAVE TO MAKE A RESERVATION **WAY** IN ADVANCE. If you want to go on a Friday night and call them the Tuesday before, it's not gonna happen. Keep in mind the restaurant is closed on Mondays. It doesn't open until 5 Tuesday-Saturday, and they open at 4 on Sundays.

If you don't make a reservation, you can try to get a seat at the bar, but you literally have to be there 15-20 minutes before they open and wait outside to get a seat. It's so hard to get a reservation because the place is small, plus reservations are made based on a two hour dining experience. You can't make a reservation for more than 6, at least for the first floor.

The have a margarita sampler, where you get 3 half glasses of margartias, so you can try a couple flavors. The sampler runs you $15. The cucumber margartia is very, very refreshing. I also like the blood orange one, and the spicy mango isn't bad. The last time I went, I got a red bell pepper margarita, and it really did taste like one, but I don't like to drink peppers so I didn't care for it, plus it was a little spicy.

The only thing I would say I don't really care for is that you are charged for items such as chips, but it's only $2 for the basket--if that makes or breaks you, I don't think you will care much for the restaurant. I typically get the pico with the chips for an appetizer, which is usually good--the last time I went, it didn't have as much flavor as it usually does. My boyfriend loves their guac, but I always stop him from getting it as an appetizer because the machaca that I always get comes with it, and it won't all get eaten.  I would only get it if we are there with a big group and everyone will be eating it.

Lastly, the service---everytime I go there and sit at the bar, it's the same guy with thick framed glasses, and he is very good. He's nice and extrememly knowledgeable about the food and drinks. It seems that all the males here are very nice, I don't care for any of the female hostesses/servers--their customer service is so-so, and they don't really do anything to go above and beyond, even when it comes to saying nice, simple ""hello"" when you walk in.

The owner also did all the artwork on the walls---so awesome!

Now for 5 tacos I paid 14 dollars, averages out to 2.80 a taco which isn't bad, but I can get a better tasting taco at a much faster timing for only two dollars.

Main entree:
28 oz bone in ribeye (medium). I shared this with another person and we finished it. It was good with the peppercorn sauce

We had a range from the menu 
Spicy fish (cat fish), kung pao chicken, vinegar cucumber, fried rice, tofu spied and a bit more
All of us were very super hungry so all the food really vanished quick. 
When that happens it's a sign of good food on the table. 
We had to order more and few of us also made a Togo order 
My fav tonight was the Spicy fillet fish, super good for a spicy lover. It's not chilli hot but a more ginger hot. 
The bad thing in this spot is the service, single employee full restaurant, come employe more people. But most Chinese restaurants don't focus on service

On one of my ventures here I was with a group who decided to try the family style.  We had 2 fish dinners (amok & the mango) both were very, very delicious.  Loved the flavorings.  We also had a couple of the chicken dishes and a cold sliced beef with vegetables.
I suggested to the 2nd group since they were not familiar with Cambodian foods to order family style.   Since I know pretty much what I like I wanted to order my own.  I ordered the fish mango again.  Had my standard mango bo bo and ended up taking about half my fish home for a late night snack.
Will be returning next week again with another group of eaters.  LOL
Never tasted anything here that I didn't like.  I guess that the fish is my favorite. It is a hard choice though.
Service is excellent, but just be prepared, especially with groups, that the food is prepared fresh and it may take some time before you get your dish.  They do not bring all dishes at once as that would involve them sitting in the kitchen while they prepare the other dishes. Nobody wants food that has stood and is not hot.
What else can I say except that I just LOVE eating here and will keep recommending it to my groups of friends.
I just keep coming back!!!!",2013-10-20 18:31:41

The food is pretty good compared to the other Indian restaurants in town. My favorites are Haveli and Swad. 

To give them a fair chance, my spouse and I have been to Minerva three times for the lunch buffet on the weekday and weekend at least an hour to an hour and a half before the buffet was to close. Each of those times, we did not feel particularly welcome or that our business was appreciated. Frankly, we felt like we were imposing.  I thought it was me and did not say anything until my wife made the comment after we had left the first time. Our next two visits were the same.

On all of our visits, our table was cleared reasonably promptly so there's no issue there. It has always been upon entering and exiting that we get these blank stares with barely an acknowledgment.  I have not heard this from other people so suspect it could just be us although I am not sure why since we are pretty affable and well mannered.  A simple hello, thank you and a smile or nod would suffice.  

Their buffet selection is on the small side and is just OK quality and taste wise.  The space is a little cramped.  If there were any more than a few other tables of people, a wheelchair bound guest could not be accommodated readily. All told, there are more comfortable and welcoming settings with better food.

My mom decided for my family to go here for her birthday dinner, perfect excuse to finally try it out! To my surprise (note the sarcasm), she was 100% right. Their happy hour is AWESOME. Not only do they have happy hour from 5-7 (a little later for those that work late!) but they have great prices for being such a nice steakhouse kind of restaurant.

First of all, they give you complimentary popcorn. If you know me, you know I freakin' love popcorn so this was an instant bonus. It's not just any popcorn, its popcorn with truffle oil, butter, and salt on it, making it incredibly addicting. The best part is, you can just keep asking for more popcorn....for FREE. 

Beers are $3, glasses of wine $5, and some specialty cocktails for $6 like sangria or their Moscow mule. I ordered the sangria, which is a red wine sangria, and it was very tasty. If I wasn't driving, I would have ordered a 2nd or 3rd glass.

As a table we decided to split their Kobe beef sliders (2 for $5), the parmesan truffle fries, and the bruschetta. Let's just say there was nothing left on our plates. Everything was delicious and well prepared. My dad and I ended up splitting one more order of the sliders, because...they are $5! Why not?!

My sister let our amazing server, Barbara, know it was our mom's bday at the beginning of the meal and at the end she brought out a complimentary birthday dessert! My mom chose the carrot cake and that thing was impressively layered and tall! Also incredible, I might add.

Only complaint here is that there were a couple things I noticed that I wanted to touch on as far as details go- they didn't vacuum underneath the front seats as there were little items I saw that could have been cleaned up. I also noticed that once it goes through the car wash (before it is hand dried)- they don't seem to clean up after (there were a little more dirt stains that could have been removed from a towel rub) 

Other than that, I really like how organized the Craig Road car wash is. They all know exactly what their part is  and they all do do their part well. I was happy with how shiny my car was after getting the luxury package they claimed was on a special at $31.99. 

Note, that this place will try to upsell you. They are a business so it's expected, but every time I've been here, they always upsell to the next car wash package, so if you're a sucker like I am, you'll be spending 10 more dollars than you thought you would initially.",2013-03-31 15:10:28

THAT's how great the views are, how green the trees are, and how clear the water looks on a sunny summer day.

My boyfriend and I visited The Bluffs one Monday morning. It was our first time and we had little to no knowledge as to where and how to reach the various lookout points as seen in photos online. We decided to just do a bit of exploration on our own...

We started the day by driving all the way down Brimley Road South. To the right is a big Green P parking lot with a bunch of signs that say parking costs $0.75/half hour, but if you check the Green P website, it says parking is FREE on Monday to Friday before 5:00 PM. We took a stroll along the water, but there was no sign of a nice beach or a trail nearby. But we did notice some people up on the cliffs, so we decided to drive back up Brimley Road South to search for those lookout points. 

We hopped back in our car and at the intersection of Brimley Road South and Bluffers Park, I saw a sign that said 'Beach' so off we went! The path led us to a smaller parking lot that was about half full around noon. I kept thinking to myself, wow...I can't imagine how busy this beach is on the weekends! It was a nice, clean beach with soft sand. The only downside was there were quite a few seagulls flying around... We had an umbrella, so it was not a huge problem. ;) When we left the beach around 2:30 PM, the parking lot was PACKED (it was only Monday...).

Our next stop was to the top of the cliffs to check out the lookout points, so we headed back up Brimley Road South.

Wow, so disappointing! At 11:30am on a Sunday we grabbed 3 of these supposedly famous bagels to enjoy outside with our yummy lattes from Cafe Olimpico down the street. 

Our order: 1 sesame, 1 poppy, 1 everything...and 3 mini cream cheese packets. A recipe for deliciousness, no? NO. The bagels were cold, hard, nothing special at all.

Were they having an off day? Perhaps. Still.....*single bagel tear*....very disappointing. Next time I would request ""WARM bagels"" if I were you :)

First off - I LOVE THE CHEESE CURDS. They are little greasy nuggets of joy. So if you don't like greasy food, these are the last thing you should order. But dang, they are awesome. :)

So, I like shuffleboard. Enough that I've played for shirts before (of which I won, by the way). When my opponent lost their shirt, Monkey Pants and any other patrons didn't even seem to mind. After all, they have a shirtless shot 1-2x a night anyways so it isn't completely uncommon to see shirtless people in here.

Drinks seem to be reasonable here as well, especially if you order some of their special drinks.

Food is pretty decent as well and I'd put it about one step above bar food in some cases.

I'm not sure how long they have been doing it... but they had a ""power saver"" night where they wouldn't use lights, but rather candles for their lighting. As stupid as it sounds, I REALLY loved it. The bartenders also dressed up and it ended up feeling like a speak-easy. Speaking of bartenders, they are pretty dang attentive. I think I've received some of the fastest service here.

Overall, I like this place. I wish I lived closer so I could just walk there. I could see this as being my local watering hole.

This review is based on Savour York Region Winter 2013's experience. For $15 it is well worth it for a 3 course lunch.

Service was a little slow to start with just 1 other table which seemed to be regulars for a late lunch. 

Mista Salad - plentiful and fresh but the Folco's House Dressing was a little too sour to my liking

Veal Parmigiana - Veal was really tender and moist! I love the light crispy breading too! The tomato sauce was nice but just a little too much and I have to scrap it off. Penne was cooked perfectly al dente!

Dessert.  - Sadly Pumpkin Spice Creme Burlee was not available and a substitution was offered. I was a little disappointed...

1.5 stars. I usually round up but here I'm rounding down for the dishonesty of their check-in scam.

We were craving sushi around 1am and this was the only AYCE we saw that was open past 2am.

Service was friendly and not inattentive though that may have had to do with the fact that we were the only ones there at 1am (despite their supposedly closing at 3am).

Last call is posted in the window as 2:15 but when we sat down we were informed last call was at 1:45am. Did not contest the sign on the door. Maybe they changed their hours, but if that is the case then they needed to also change their signs.

The sushi rice was too sweet.

Fish across the board was not very fresh.

Uni was not great. The brighter the color, the better. Pale or brown uni has either a plasticky or seaweedy (and not in a good way) taste to it. These were pretty brown, but surprisingly not as awful as at JJANGA or Goyemon.

Oysters were far from the worst I'd ever had, but the freshness of a raw seafood item is still worryingly called into question when you feel the need to put lemon slices directly on it.

Snow crab was so cloyingly sweet it was sweeter than the shaved ice we had at Chada St on Tuesday. It did not taste like crab at all, real *or* fake.

We asked for no sauce on anything but they only remembered to not put sauce on our shrimp tempura roll, which had surprise ""krab"" (fake crab) in it.

Which brings me to the rolls. Rolls on the special, baked, and fried rolls lists (basically everything that was not on the traditional roll list) were not very varied. Almost everything had fake crab in it even if it was not a listed ingredient. Everything that didn't have krab had spicy tuna and everything that didn't have spicy tuna had krab.

We ended up only getting a couple rolls because after they couldn't get ""no sauce"""" right we were not confident they would be able to do ""no crab"" reliably and did not want to fill our stomachs with that sweet crud.

Disappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could still have green tea ice cream and still have tempura and not have tempura green tea ice cream (I had horrific thoughts of soggy, pre-tempura'd ice cream dancing rudely in my head, but the DH informed me that they have to super-freeze a ball of ice cream in order to tempura it without it melting, and that this takes 2 hours or more, so apparently that's how).

Don't like the scam they're running for the check-in discount. Have encountered the whole ""write good review for a discount"" scam before, but never seen it attached to a check-in, or seen a place where they want the review up front. Makes no sense.",2016-02-19 10:28:45

We just finished my daughter's birthday party here and here and it was fantastic. The reservations I had about the place were completely thrown out the window from the moment I arrived. I was offered help by the staff in bringing all the stuff in from my car. They allowed me to come 30 min early to set up and decorate. Put our food/waters/cake in the fridge before the guests arrived. We also had a staff helper come in to pass out pizza and cut the cake (an ice cream cake which I don't recommend because they are so tough to cut). When time was up she politely let us know and helped clean up. We had no issues with parents being allowed to follow their kids around and watch them jump. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. I have to say I was impressed and I have really high standards. 



I'm interested in having my daughter's birthday party here but there's a few issues. 

1) although they provide table cloths and paper plates/utensils they only use colors green and purple. They said I could bring my own but I will only be given 15 min to decorate and set up for the party. That is not a reasonable amount of time to set up and decorate with my own supplies.

2) There is only 1 ""party room"" where up to 3 birthday parties can be going on at the same time. I haven't seen the space for it but it seems like it would be distracting to have another child's birthday party going on in the same room. 

3) You have to purchase food through them or else they charge $50 if you bring outside food. I asked what other food options they have and they said they only sell pizza and soda. Not very health or diverse options.

4) They charge $21 additional for the parents to go out with the child. I can understand for older kids but 6 year olds often stilneed help with things and birthday party parents will want to check on their kids to make sure everything is ok

That said, the veggie sausages are delicious. The options for us were
Soy (Pastrami)
Tofu (Italian&Kielbasa)
Fennel (Sicilian)

Over the course of our two visits we tried them all. My favourite was the Sicilian, which seemed the most complicated, flavour-wise, but they were all really great.

The beer selection is also top-notch, and they give you an exorbitant amount of fries if you order a large. Even if you're super hungry, you'll need 2 other people to share a large dirty fries. We brought our leftover fries to Shakespeare in the Park's version of ""Taming of the Shrew"" (2 stars for a mediocre ""modern update"" of the text, and also it is 2013, we can stop making jokes about how Starbucks names their coffee. When Tom Hanks used similar commentary in 1998's ""You've Got Mail"" it was already not particularly timely) and sadly our leftovers were plundered by ants.

The only reason I give this a 3-star review is that, honestly, it's Sausage. Like, even if I were a meat eater, I really don't know if a Sausage is the best way to showcase all the different varieties of meat. It seems kind of a waste. Meanwhile, delicious as the veggie sausages are - I don't know that the price validates how much more tasty they are then, say, a veggie sausage from a street vendor.

Turns out for restaurant week, Samba limits their available meats from the usual 9 to 6.  This initially was a turn off but 6 was probably sufficient.  They were:

- Garlic Roasted Chicken Legs (not Mango BBQ Chicken as stated on the website)
- Parmesan Pork
- Linguica (pork sausage)
- Leg of Lamb
- Flank Steak
- Picanha

The website also said garlic bread which wasn't served (no big deal) and of course they served the cinnamon dusted pineapple.

Also of note, the little rolls were no longer served on the table, you had to get your own at the salad buffet.  I don't know if that was done just for restaurant week or if that is the way they are handling the rolls now.

Last night the meat was fantastic!  However that has not always been the case as we have experienced dry pork and overcooked steak.  The pork was tender and the beef was savory though a bit salty sometimes.  The upscale salad bar was spot on as usual.  Hot sides served last night were the beef stew, rice, garlic mashed potatoes and a tomato cream soup.  They have had a black bean side in the past which I get, but I didn't miss it terribly last night.

Four stars simply because we feel at nearly $40 per person it's not worth it outside of restaurant week.  Even $30 can feel a bit high and if they had a menu with standard entrees we might find ourselves ordering from that menu versus the all you can eat experience.

I went to Muku for the first time yesterday for lunch. This is a great little spot for ramen noodles. Muku specializes in ramen noodles and has a very limited menu of other items. There is no sushi served at Muku, which makes sense as that's why Globefish specializes in. They have about 10 different variations on ramen.  About half of them were soy-sauced based and half were miso based. For the soy-sauce based, they had ton-katsu ramen, spicy ton-katsu ramen, chasu ramen, wonton ramen, and chasu wonton ramen. For the miso based, they offered miso ramen, miso wonton ramen, miso wonton chasu ramen,etc. 

I really enjoyed the ton-katsu ramen (soy-sauce based broth). The noodles were a little chewy as they are supposed to be. I really liked the chewiness of the noodles. The bbq pork was not too fatty. I wasn't crazy about the broth as it was quite rich. But in comparison,  it was quite decent and not greasy. This place is definitely much better than Shikiji's. I'm glad we have more choices now when it comes to ramen noodles ever since Muku opened. I heard the chef was from Hiroshima. This is definitely a nice place for lunch. I'd go back for sure. It's also nice that they have parking as well.",2008-10-19 04:45:35

In terms of the restaurant itself, I thought the atmosphere was beautiful, cozy and warm. 

The service was great. To be honest, the bread boys were the most pleasant- so polite and just had such a kind demeanour. The waiter we had was polite and to the point. He gave us our privacy, which is what my fiance prefers when we go out and eat; less talk, more food. For me, I like a little conversation from the waiter. For some reason it bummed me out that he didn't ask if we were here for a special occasion or not. I go to the Keg often and they ALWAYS ask if I'm celebrating or just having a nice dinner out. That's just my personal preference though and I'm not docking any points. 

The food was DELICIOUS. The steak was moist and succulent. Perfectly cooked- just the way we asked. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and tasty. 

Lobster spoons were so so good. Creamy, buttery and flavourful. 

The mango sorbet was yummy and the fruit toppings were fresh. 

We had other delicious things too that I can't remember exactly what we had but all I know is I left very full and very happy.  

The only reason I docked one star is because the manager came out to talk to a couple that obviously frequents the restaurant. She talked to them for a very long time, quite loudly. It didn't really bother me because I think loyal customers should be treated well! Plus, their conversation was kind of funny and cute. What bothered me is that she ignored everyone sitting around the couple's table and didn't even bother to say 'Good evening. How is your meal?'. Considering One Restaurant is a fine dining restaurant, I have a higher expectation of management. It just made my fiance and I feel unwelcome at a place we were visiting for the first time. 

If the manager is coming out to say hello to regular, he/she should also come around to tables to say 'Hello' to new patrons as well. 

I will definitely be coming again to try the lunch menu though.",2015-03-25 22:06:06

If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further. I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy. The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better. Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill. Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater.

A few nice points, the place is nice looking.  They did a good job making it look upscale, and in the small town of Murrysville there aren't a ton of higher dining establishments to choose from.  That said they are often busy and can get crowded and long waits to get a table.  The bar is even worse!  I think they may have seating for 10, so if you are a lucky one to get a seat to wait or drink be careful if you have to get up to use the restroom as there are people huddled behind you two rows deep ready to pounce on your seat..  So that's annoying.  Another thing I have noticed is that the menu is small and really hasn't changed much if at all in the past 8 years.  Last time I was there I got the scallops and was really not happy.  They were rubbery overcooked and small.  The rice they were sitting one tasted microwaved and old, and for all this just a measly $20.00.  Can I say overpriced? Yes three quarter sized scallops and a spoon of old mushy rice, $20.00 plus tax$tip.  I don't think I will be ordering that again.   Maybe just stick to a burger or something.

Today the BF and I decided to lunch here instead of the food court because there seemed to be ""healthier"" options. Everything looked so good! I decided on a chicken stir-fry and he got a burger with fries. Everything is made to order right in front of you. The stir-fry has a good chicken to veggie ratio and they don't fill the bowl with too much rice. I also enjoyed everything they put in the stir fry.

Given I was a guest in the hotel- One was sort of my ""go to"" restaurant over the days that I was there.  It is open for breakfast/brunch, lunch and dinner and they are extremely accommodating if you want something from one menu at a different time.

The bar is dimly lit and seems to be the ""place to see and be seen"" in Yorkville as the seats at the bar were usually filled with locals who knew each other well and used the bar to catch up on that day's activities or to read the local paper.  I liked that the locals were friendly and immediately ""adopted me"" as one of their own, buying me drinks and suggesting things to do while I was in town.

The bartenders pour a good drink be it a simple Bloody Mary or a perfectly shaken martini.  They also were quick to welcome me to eat that their bar- something I availed myself of several times during my stay.

And it didn't matter what I ordered, the food at the Mark McEwen restaurant was very good albeit simply prepared without a lot of the ""frou frou"" that so many chefs think they need today.  I sampled the fresh oysters of the day and the tuna tartar as starters- both were quick to come up and served with a smile.  My favorite thing was probably the chicken salad ""Cobb style"" as the bacon was pancetta and the dressing was a vinaigrette versus the usual overbearing blue cheese dressing.  I also had some salmon for dinner one night that was also quite tasty.

And if you really want to indulge- have one of their excellent desserts.  I opted for the 6 freshly baked cookies and some vanilla ice cream, but the chocolate bread pudding was a close second choice.

The only thing I had that I wasn't crazy about was an omelet for breakfast as I thought the onions overwhelmed the dish and the eggs surrounding it were a bit on the gummy side.

Service is good although know if you are at the bar that the regulars may have your bartender's attention.

Too bad I was here in the Winter and couldn't sit out on the patio.  It would have been great for people watching and breakfast outside is one of my favorite things in life.  Oh well . . .there is always the next time . .and you can bet there will be a next time!",2013-11-27 17:21:16

Not CVS's fault.  I was thankful that there were CVS in Las Vegas to address this for me and happy there were 24 hr pharmacies.

Pro:
- 24 hr pharmacy available
- the pharmacist called all the CVS 24 hr pharmacies to try to find one that had what I needed for my prescription
- I did eventually get a call back very late at night the night before Thanksgiving telling me that none of the Las Vegas or surrounding areas for 24 hr CVS pharmacies could fill my prescription
- opened on holidays

Cons:
- the wait on the phone was ridiculous.  Not sure if only 1 person was manning everything or not, but I was on hold for over 45 minutes and I ended up just hanging up

This wait time was really long, way more than reasonable.  I used multiple phones to call and all of them on hold.  Guess when I ended all calls, whomever was manning the phones was probably relieved that he didn't have to answer that many calls.  It would have been nice for him to say to call back later or something.  For that I give a 1 star.

However, he did check all the 24-hr CVS pharmacies for me, so that was a 5 star.  And him giving me a call back was a 5 star.  The fact that they were opened for the holidays for forgetful people like me, another 5 star.

The only drawbacks were that I couldn't get my prescription filled when I needed it and the long phone wait time.  However, if they are under manned at the time, through the holidays, I can give grace to the people who had to work.  I should be okay to get this prescription filled the day after Thanksgiving.",2015-11-27 17:08:13

Edge-of-shell-to-edge-of-shell, these incredibly plump and delicious mussels were a dream come true. SO hard to find good quality mussels and a chef who knows what to do with them. Bravo!

The oysters here are *expertly* shucked. And for those who scoff or make fun of the fact that I *always* mention shucking skills in my reviews that involve raw oysters/clams - I stand my ground and attest that 90% of the shuckers out there in restaurant world don't know what the hell they're doing when it comes to shucking, and the 90% find a way to ruin raw oysters/clams by getting hard bits of debris (shell bits, ocean crap) into the finished, plated product. So 5 stars for an uber-clean shuck. Every one of the 36 raw ones that came to our table was debris-free. That's hard to do! Molto bravo!

The lighting... the newish Edison bulb lighting is a great effort in trying to warm up the joint, but dimmers are desperately needed to ease the retinal burn, if you know what I'm sayin'. Those fancy unfiltered bulbs are wayyy too bright for naked eyes at normal stock wattages. We kindly asked our waiter to turn off 2 of the 3 bulbs that were blazing away in the floor lamp directly facing the West side of our party of 6. Much better, but with candles already on the table, I wonder if floor lamps are even necessary? There's gotta be a perfect balance...

Overall, a huge win for team Other Mama! We ate and drank and ate and drank to the tune of $100+ per person and loved it. Yeah, not a cheap outing, but we'd much rather spend this in our neighborhood than in a casino corporate joint. It feels good to chow down locally!

This place is unique and is the best place I have found to have a romantic evening hands down.  It is probably the best specialty wine shop in town too.  You walk in to a great fairly large wine shop, it's not the cheapest place but you get fantastic wines.  I mean you'll spend less at trader joe's but you get a larger more upsclale selection, typically they have french and california wines and I would guess 80% of them are between 16-50 bucks and most of the stuff you don't see everywhere else.  For an extra 10 bucks you can have the wine with your meal, so for 35 bucks you get a real good wine with dinner and for 50 to 60 you get a great wine that would probably cost you well over a hundred easy anywhere else.  

The food here is well made french bistro food, it's not ""oh my god amazing life changing"" but I have had some things here that have been awesome and everything else has been real tasty to say the least.  They do have an apple crumb dessert that is awesome and i once had scallops with fresh pea risotto that I still remember as one of the best things I have ever tasted (seasonal).  Typically we get a bottle of wine, snack on a cheese platter or appetizer and split an entree or something for well under a 100 bucks.     

On an evening when we have nice mild weather you must go and sit on the patio overlooking the ""lake"" and have a nice dinner.  Even when it isn't ideal they have misters or heaters or you could always sit inside that is also still real nice. 

The staff has always been great.  We have been going here for years but recently we have been going more often and the waitress we typically have is very friendly and remembered us by our second time around.  

Saturdays they have wine tastings also and if you register your email they send you updates about different events that they have often.

5 stars not because the food is as good as is gets but the place is definitely as good as is gets.",2010-04-23 14:53:35

I ended up just going to the room that was paid for, for myself. First of all, I love hotel pillows. I'm always tempted to steal them (but I didn't, I swear!) and my room was nicely furnished. I had nothing to do last night so I watched TV but the volume literally stops getting higher at a certain point, which made it difficult for me to hear because the walls are so thin, I can hear two men talking.

Went to sleep, but I woke up at 5am because the guests in the hotel room above me, or whatever is above the first floor, were STOMPING. ENDLESSLY STOMPING. I was tempted to call and complain about the noise but I wasn't sure anyone would do anything about it so I tried to go to sleep, only to constantly hear the beeping of the crosswalk signal. OH MY GOSH. 

Covered my ears with a pillow and woke up at 7am, again, to hearing the crosswalk beeps and also, this time, a man and woman conversing, the conversation can mostly be heard toward the foot of my bed, in the direction of my bathroom area.

In addition to the rude awakening of stomping, the crosswalk beeping, and the other guests' conversations, I woke up with 4 itchy bites!!!! One on the back of my right thigh (that's the worst one), one on the front of my right thigh, one on my left thigh, and one on my left ankle. A friend told me that hotels in AZ usually have bed bugs so it's common, but I hope this was not the case???! Gross gross gross and VERY itchy. 

I had breakfast at 7:30am and wanted cereal, but they did not have dairy free milk, or soy free milk so I just picked at the cereal itself. I loved that they had tiny little Nutella packets so I toasted myself some bread and smeared some Nutella on, and ate a banana. The eggs were... Tasteless. But I'm not so picky that I will pick apart their breakfast menu. 

Anyway, overall, I hope I do not have to stay here again. EXTREMELY thin walls and bug bites are a deal breaker for me.",2015-09-19 14:04:52

We all shared the Pleaser dinner. It was HUGE. Two kinds of rice, 5 types of meat, 2 types of Naan, and salad. We were stuffed and still have plenty of rice, salad, and naan to take home. Everything is well seasoned, with a nice variety of spice.

The pork katsu was really juicy and all the meats were delish.  My recommendation is to cook each meat separately to really enjoy.  Like others here have stated, this is not Korean AYCE.   The concept is similar but this is definitely a different sport.  It's more about the quality and savoring everything.  Of course, more is better.

This is probably the closest you can get to Gyu-Kaku (Honolulu, HI).  If anyone has had the AYCE there, talk about premium qualities and combining the AYCE concept.

The special omelette of the day, the quiche of the day, the croque madame (which came out about 10 minutes after everyone else's entrees), and even the chicken and waffles were disappointing.  Everything tasted so mediocre and salty.  My fries were overcooked and oversalted, the sausage was greasy, and the omelette and croque madame were completely underwhelming (I've made better at home).  My parents were really nice about it but I was so embarrassed that I had raved about this place and insisted on taking them here.

- Entree (cooked in the coq au vin style) of ahi tuna, shrimp, sirloin, chicken breast & teriyaki-marinated sirloin.

Walked in right after they opened at 5:30 and told the first server we saw that we'd just be drinking. He led us into the bar and when we told him that we'd be joined by another couple, he suggested we sit in the seashell. You have to see it to appreciate it but basically one end of the bar area has been formed to resemble the inside of a shell-complete with a round 'pearl' light right in front of it. So unique and somehow not as tacky as you'd think. I doubt I would even have noticed it had the server not pointed it out. 

Very cool bar area and dining area as well. Love the old boat sitting in the middle of the front room. It takes up a lot of space but really adds a lot to the atmosphere.

I took a bite of the tuna by itself and it was pretty much tasteless.  Would have been better if I'd poured salt on it (no more, high blood pressure you know).   Megan's cheeseburger was a little above average, mostly due to the thick slices of bacon that came with it.  French fries were ok, and the food was just kinda warm, at least Megan's was.  Mine, however, was not.  Bun was almost cold.  I don't think I'll be going here again.

We went based on the sheer fact that they were open later than most Chinese restaurants in the area. The antiquated blue interior was uneasy on the eyes, but it was clean. 

They have great combo specials served all day for $6.95. Not a bad deal at all! This is a great spot for lunch and dinner at bargain prices. You can also choose your entree size: small (under $6) or large (under $10). They offer generous portions, so we would try small next time. 

The good:
Crab Rangoon $4.25 - 6 large pieces of crispy golden fried wontons stuffed with cream cheese. Very addicting! We enjoyed it with their sweet and sour sauce. 5/5

Hot and sour soup - we ordered a small $1.60 and it was piping hot and the perfect size to share. Great flavor! 5/5

Moo shu pork served with eggroll wrappers and hoisen sauce - we ordered a large $8.25 and it was a very generous serving. It had mushrooms, cabbage, pork, and bamboo shoots. It was a great version and we really enjoyed this flavorful dish. 5/5

The bad:
Sweet and sour pork - ok, so we definitely took the wrong step with this dish. We ordered a large $8.25 and although the portion was massive, each pork morsel had way too much breading. Just imagine the dough on corn dogs...each pork was excessively covered in thick dough. Way too filling, in a bad way. It was bland as well, so we added salt to the sauce and it helped. Also, they barely gave us any vegetables and pineapple, so overall it wasn't a balanced dish. Nope I wouldn't order it again, it was poorly executed. 1/5",2014-06-27 01:06:36

I was tempted to get their signature item, the little Pink Tacos, but opted for the carnitas plate instead ($14).  The chips they served were pretty good, the salsa was standard and more on the watery side.  Our food didn't take too long to come out and boy were there lots of chunks of pork on my plate.  I couldn't finish all the food, it was also served with spanish rice on the side and tomatoes and guacamole.  The pork though flavorful enough was a little on the hard side.  We all know that carnitas is supposed to be super tender.  Definitely would have been a 4 star rating if the pork was tender, but it wasn't bad at all and it was served with a couple flour tortillas.  The fajitas also smelled and looked delicious as well.

The sales person, Alan, was outstanding at showing us all the options and Mark did a follow-up measurement just to make sure they fit perfectly before installation.

 We liked them so much we had valances made to hide the hardware which wasn't much of an issue but finished them up beautifully. Mark uses marine grade stainless steel in all the hardware and marine grade pull ropes. They operate very smoothly with very little effort. It completely transformed our ourdoor patio into almost a seperate enclosed room that you cannot see thru from the outside. We wanted something that would give us privacy and shade. The fabric used was the 95% sun ray block and is not only durable but matched our house color perfectly.  We ended up using Mark because he has his own shop and does quality work. Everything is built by hand to exacting specs by him. Not to mention the many good reviews we read. Plus I know if there ever is a problem he will come out and fix it. He delivered right on time despite the fact I asked him for some extra time so I could paint and fix a minor roof problem before the installation.. Our only regret is that we didn't find Sunscreens by Mark sooner since we're not happy with the company who installed our sunscreens.

We stopped in for a nice little lunch.  The lunch menu wasn't huge and most of the choices seemed kind of fancy.  I ended up with a hot turkey sandwich with a side of potato salad.  The potato salad lacked flavor and I wouldn't get it again.  The sandwich was very tasty and I had plenty left over for a second meal later.  The hubby got the daily special which was some kind of italian sausage with peppers.  It was ok, but my meal was way better (and he agreed).  Our service was just ok.  Our waitress was friendly but not overly attentive.  Fran came to our table to see how we liked our lunch and she was really sweet.  As promised, the best part of Fran's was definitely the dessert.  We ordered the tuxedo cake and it was outstanding!  Layers of chocolate and white cake with a creamy filling between layers.  Hubby and I were clanking our forks together trying to get the next bite as quick as possible.  One thing that felt off about this place was the music.  We were sitting down for a relaxing lunch and the music playing was bumping stuff like Black Eyed Peas.  Just seemed strange for the crowd and the atmosphere.

Some things I wish I knew about the show prior to attending:

1. It is a musical mash-up of Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge, and The Great Gatsby.

Another tip: Vegas.com 2-for-1 online. 

I wish the show was more interactive, where instead of watching the actors party, they partied with you.

Upon entering the restaurant around 6:30 on a Thursday night, it took about 5 minutes for the two of us to be seated. Don't misunderstand, there was no line and plenty of open tables--it just took that long for the host to come up from behind the bar (at the far end of the restaurant) to seat us. 

It was another 5 minute wait until he returned to check in on us. We were ready to order (Sambusa, vegetarian comb, and Doro Wat). We also asked for water as well. Then the true waiting began...

It took no less that 15 minutes and two requests until--wait for it--we received ONE glass of water. It came with the promise of ""one more soon"". Huh? Was there a clean glass shortage? Has the cost of water increased? Going eco-friendly?

Another 10 minutes passed until the second promised glass of water came. By this time, we already instituted a water rationing schedule: there would be no refills during this meal. Nor were there.

The service was so bad that dominated our lighthearted discussion. While it provided some comic relief, it did not set the stage for a great dinner.

The food; however, while not the best I ever had, was good. The chicken Doro Wat was particularly well seasoned. I have never had a more tender chicken that literally fell off the bone. The Miser Alicha lentils were probably the best of the veggies.

When it came time to pay, we noticed not one, but two patrons standing in front of the bar trying to get some attention (for about 10 minutes)--whether water, food, check, or hugs I do not know. We opted to pay in cash just so we could leave without waiting an extra 15 minutes for him to get back to us.

Overall the meal was filling, particularly with the injera (spongy flatbread). Still, the service was severely lacking so we'll probably stay away for a while.
 

TIP FOR VEGETARIANS: if you are a vegetarian dining with a carnivore, all of the food will come out on one massive plate where cross-contamination may occur. This didn't bother us (as neither of us are vegetarian), but I watch our for my vegetarian friends. Perhaps if you asked, they could prepare separate plates.

Made sure to come with a group so we could try other stuff.  I was so close to ending my ban on beef for the month to order some Jack & Coke.  That will probably be the biggest reason for me to come back here.

We also went with the unlimited sangria for $20 a person.  Figured that 2 glasses of wine would be $24 so what the hay?  They brought over a giant carafe for each person.  One person finishing 2 of those is pretty much impossible.  I'd rather just get a bottle of wine next time.  The sangria was pretty simple and light with no chunks of fruit in it.  

Tuna sashimi, poona tuna, sea bass skewers and lobster taquitos were the standouts for me.  All the beef dishes looked soooooo good.  

My wife ordered Nuttin Honey first and it didn't come until the third round of orders.  Wtf?  Wasn't even worth waiting for.  This was very Panda Expressy.

In my life I've had many, many Vosges chocolate bars that I've purchased from my local candy store. I've loved every bar I've had, especially the bacon chocolate bar. It wasn't until my buddy, Michelle T, wrote here review about their shop that I realized they offered so much more than fancy chocolate bars. 

Located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, Vosges Haut-Chocolat is a small shop that features many gourmet chocolate treats. They carry everything from chocolate bars, truffles, all types of toffee and even chocolate drinks. 

My wife and I were able to sample many things in the short time we were in the shop. One of the things we sampled that stood out the most was their Red Fire Toffee. It was chocolaty, caramely, crunchy and had a nice spicy kick. I liked it so much I ended up buying a small box. 

My wife purchased a box of their caramel toffee chocolate covered marshmallows, which were also fabulous.

Even though the prices here a bit high, you definitely get what you pay for. Their truffles, toffee and bars are all phenomenal. The people who work here are all super friendly and love to talk about the products they sell.

They are ALWAYS running sushi specials whenever I go in for dinner.  It's like the menu prices don't even matter when it comes to sushi because of said specials, so it's easy to stock up on different varieties of sushi, and even more easy to get full.  Mind you, it's not exactly ""free"" either, but does give some some leniency to play with the different types of rolls.

I've only been one time for lunch, but that was several months ago, and I wasn't jazzed about the service during the day shift (they served everyone at the table but me, and my meal was much later. Not by 2-3 minutes, but around 15.  Still good, but everyone was already finished with bento boxes and sashimi rolls, and I ate alone in a crowd - we were also the only lunch table that day).  

While I realize that may have been a fluke, I still normally do the sushi bit at night, and again, the service is solid there.  I like the people that run the place, from the hostess, to our sever, to the chefs.  Desserts are also good.  They have a pretty tasty mango sorbet with chocolate that's good for sharing.

I don't go often, but I've consistently had good dinners, and I like being treated like a familiar and recognized ""regular"", despite my only stopping in once a month or so.

Life changing?  Perhaps not so much.  But it is dependable, and I don't feel like I'm going to end up spinning a roulette wheel when it comes to the overall quality and flavor.",2010-02-15 17:25:53

As far as the taste of the food I got the avocada club it had Fresh avocado, applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing and mayo. This probably the only burger where I could actually taste the avocado! The bacon wasn't some silly paper thin bacon too, it was bacon only gods would eat. Burger was definitely a 5/5.
The smash fries on the other hand....taste super bland. Just a whole bunch of unnecessary oil that give no flavoring at all. 

Another plus about this place is they you can get any sauce you want for freee!!!!! WHOOOOO

Ehh. It wasn't bad, but certainly nothing to go out of your way for...

(+) Matinee price of $8.50 was nice. I could definitely deal with that.
(+) Screen was large and massive and sound quality was on point. No complaints as far as all that goes.

(-) No refills on drinks. Like...at all. Boo! Every other place in the city give 1 free refill on both soda and popcorn as long as you purchase the large. Cheap asses.
(-) Seats do not recline all the way back. Actually they only recline back about 6-9 inches and that is all. Weak....and disappointing. 

It is still an okay place to see a movie, but there are much, much better options in the city for a more ""luxury"" experience.

I spent about two hours going through. Everything is nicely arranged in the booths. However, there is a severe lack of assistants. If you wanted to look at something in a case, good luck.

I grew up antiquating with my parents, and the majority of my house is full of antiques. I would reckon to say that many of the items in this store are not antique. There is a wide range of prices between booths on the same items. A Pryex dish may be $15 in one booth, and then $40 in another. Same design, etc. There is no consistency.

They always say patio seating is first come first serve, but we never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated from our reservation time. Service is top notch. Everyone is very kind and thorough. Someone is always making sure our drinks are filled and our table is free of crumbs. 

We usually order the same things here. We share the 28oz bone in rib eye in medium, lobster Mac and cheese, some oysters and sautéed mushrooms. The steak is absolutely delicious and flavorful, cooked to perfection. It comes with a few sauces, but I only taste the sauces and not really having to use them because the steak is already perf without them.

Apparently that Saturday ""bottom line, best we can do"", quoted by the Sales Mgr, price had a lot of room underneath it.

PS  This is not specific to Keffer but, don't believe the TrueCar price when a sales person whispers in your ear about this magical website, that they ""are really not supposed to tell you about"".

Noodles were cooked well.. not soggy and not too hard - but perfectly cooked with a bit of a bite to them.

I'd especially recommend their pan fried bean curd sheet roll with shrimp and stuffed shrimp and eggplant with tofu! Their prices are very competitive:

Saturday and Sunday
8:30-11:30, 1:30-4:00: large, middle, small dimsum is $2.88 each (note that there is no dimsum takeout during this time)
11:30-1:30: sp: 3.98, large: 3.99, middle: 3.28, small 2.88

Five star review for Wal-mart, it's happening.

So, like stated in my previous reviews, Walmart is starting to carry organic items.
On my most recent trip, I found organic Ketchup, mayo with no funky stuff in it...they even left out the corn syrup!, organic quinoa, organic bananas, organic spinach, the list can go on.

I bought some of their name brand (marketside, I believe) fresh packed salsa, which decided to do a jumping stunt out of the top part of my basket, have it's lid pop off, and then splat on the floor.

Luckily, I was by the dairy, and there was a young gentleman who had no problem stopping what he was doing to get some paper towels/mop bucket/cleaner. I stood over the mess, so that no one would step in it, or slip.

Not even a minute goes by when another employee stops and asks me if I need help finding something. I tell him no, and explain the salsa mishap. He also stops what he is doing, parks his cart, and tells me that he will take over. He takes the salsa from my hand, and thanks me for waiting. 

WOW! Sorry, but that was nice. I've spilt things before in other stores, and no one has offered to stand in for me.

I love their Hello Kitty section. I found the cutest headphones the other night as well.

She also seems to have a penchant for sticking her nose in everyone else's business, because every time I see her, she's gossiping with someone about someone else in the store or about other customers.

I can't remember exactly what the old location was like, and although the upgrade is much nicer aesthetically, there's something about the ""feel"" of it that's similar (especially to how it fits in Old Town). Salty has more of a straight restaurant vibe to it (not the type of place your gonna hang out at REAL late), but it has a bit of a ""hipper"" feel to it now so there's no need to rush off to other places after you're done eating. You can stay for a few more drinks.

That being said, I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday (late) morning when we were waiting for a table across the street at RnR since we needed SOMETHING in our systems stat and this place was empty. 

The patio is nice. The bartender was nice. my mimosa (served in a margarita glass) was just fine. I even ordered a steak taco because I needed to eat something before the extremely long wait for breakfast across the street, and it was fine. 

It was hard to get a real feel for the new Salty Senorita when it was empty on a Saturday morning, but after checking it out I'd be inclined to stop in again (maybe for HH). However, it's still not a place that would immediately stand out when I was thinking of a bar and/or restaurant to hang out at in Old Town.",2014-05-02 01:27:39

When it was just Monzo and Oodle Noodle near this area , I thought they were good but once Cafe Sanuki opened up this place is as good as it gets. It's a great place for a quick lunch or dinner and their prices are fantastic - I love that everything is priced reasonably. Bowls range from 5.50$ to 9.95$. Mini rice bowl add-on for 2.50$ (I recommend getting their mini beef bowl). Pumpkin & broiled egg tempura were decent especially for 1-2$ each. I think you can get a filling meal here for less than 10$. They just need a few tweaks here and there but overall they did a great job w/ soft opening. The last time I came here I had their ontama udon & broth wasn't piping hot. Temperature was more lukewarm. Overall flavor & noodles were still good though. My favorite here is their Mentai Cream udon (#12). Staff were all nice and helpful too. Everyone seems to be well under control even when it gets super busy.",2017-12-12 07:47:30
NgXzQiK2w4akMzOgRd7miw,CXLJPkPhqMUysBA9TiPPHw,MLRu3fZjJuem-6dGuUoqgA,1,15,5,2,"I've come here twice. Both times the vet tried to up-sell lots of tests and prescription pills. 

The first time I thought they really were recommending what is for the best- and I actually did get the Xrays that they advised, though I had them done at a different vet's office, because it was significantly less expensive. (Those xrays didn't explain any of the problems either). The 2nd time, when I brought a stray dog in that looked significantly underweight. The vet said  she could feel the dogs liver... and as she began to explain the next part she hid her hands in her pockets, a classic move made by a person when not being forthcoming, and said it could be a mass, but it could also be because the dog is skinny. She said the dog looked pretty good other than that and she'd write up a action plan for getting the dog back in good health. She then left and sent in a tech with a itemized bill for blood work and shots over $500 worth. 

I then attempted to clarify what I came in for. I wanted to know the dogs health, if the dog appeared neglected or sick and what to do to help the dog gain the weight back. I wanted to know roughly how old the dog was, and what I could do to help the dog get healthy. I've never owned a dog before. I also said, I noticed the dog seemed stiff and I could hear her joints pop when she moved sometimes, and I would like information that could answer questions like, Should I give the dog glucocamine?"". Is it an injury or just because of the age? The tech left to speak with the vet again, and then returned and said, the vet says the dog is about 5, though we can't really confirm that. Here is the Prescription she wrote up. 

At this point, I was very aggravated. I exclaimed that I wanted information, dietary advice. My main concern was that the dog was underweight due to lack of food. I want to know things like what type of food is best to help the dog recover. I've NEVER even had a dog before, which I said when I made the appointment and stated several times throughout the appointment. The tech looked baffled, and I told her that I was not going to return to this clinic ever again. I went to pay and I told them that I felt swindled. I explained that I still didn't even have answers for simple questions on what type of food is best to feed an underweight dog, and I didn't understand why their office couldn't give basic care advice and instead just kept writing up quotes for tests and drugs. 

At that point the tech came to the front and said she talked to the vet and the vet wanted me to have a handout about arthritis. I admit, I sarcastically thanked her for giving me information that I could have easily looked up myself online, and explained that now I still need to look up dietary information online and I think it's ridiculous that I should have to do that when I just paid $50 to talk to a veterinarian and have the dog examined. 
 
I left promising to contact the Better Business Bureau. Which I probably will do. 

I'm just at a point in my life where I'm sick of not getting what I pay for. Is anyone with me on this? It's like I can even by an f%#^$^% sweater that won't unravel in a month because everything is made in China by 5 year olds, I buy used cars around 60,000 miles, because new cars are put together so shoddy that used cars with that kind of mileage already have new transmissions and alternators and starters... The repairs are better quality than what you actually get when you buy the car, unless you get a mechanic that insists that you have replace a $500 part in order to fix a $200 part, when 3 other people gave you quotes that didn't include that repair- or an electrician that insists the lighting in your business needs to be replaced or the lights aren't going to turn on, but when they find out that there isn't anyway to authorize that type of repair a miracle from heaven unfolds and the lights magically work once again. 

Here's the truth people. Everyone's out to get your hard earned money, and few ever offer quality service or merchandise in return. 

This veterinarian could have given me some advice like, since she's under weight you might want to feed her a puppy kibble or some wet food, or increase the portion- and also it wouldn't be a bad idea to do some blood work to see her overall general health. I could respect that, but not offering any advice on the animal whatsoever except for the tests and drugs, seems a bit ridiculous. And if they can't tell me anything about the health of the animal without the tests, then someone explain to me WHY ON EARTH THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS? If you are that clueless as to the health of the animal without your $500 full work up, then how can you in confidence recommend $50 worth of prescription drugs? 

The only redeeming quality that I have to mention about this place, is the techs are nice and friendly.",2013-02-11 19:40:21

I believe there are about 18 cashier stations (Just incase it gets really busy) they have the right amount of cashiers open depending on how busy it is. As I was lining up, the cashier was soooo slow (and kept checking food prices, therefore holding up the line, so I switched to a faster lane and this girl was quick! And knew all the codes!) So it's a hit or miss depending on the cashier you got.

The food court is an OK size, so we decided to try a bit of each so to see the taste, there's lots of cooked food selection from Chinese, Indian to Mediterranean. We tried something from each station. The Chinese food was OK and was packed; she stuffed it so full that it was hard to close to lid. The Indian food was horrible, the butter chicken curry was not good, and they didn't have naan, so ok sure we'll have the balsamic rice, it was HARD and DRY. And than the Mediterranean section we tried some appetizers etc, it was all dried and overcooked stuff. 

The freshly made bubble tea, tasted horrible. 

SELECTION: There's a lot to choose from if buying groceries, lots of exotic fruits, we even got some fresh, soursop, jackfruit and mangosteen. But it's nothing I can't find at T&T. The sliced bread was nice and the bakery had some tasty/good looking stuff.

So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more.

The lady bartender who gave me crap about my water was just unpleasant the whole time I was there. Even without the whole water thing I still would have thought she was a b*tch.

My friend accidentally spilled his drink & they tried to tell him they were out of Midori. 2 seconds later they start telling him they'll get more from the back. Make up your damn minds.

The only slightly redeeming qualities about this place is the juke box & restroom. I remember the restroom being clean. I didn't see anyone choosing music but what got played was stuff I liked.

All in all this place was a failure.",2010-03-11 18:46:08

Many things are different and none of them are for the better. We ordered two California Rolls and they came like 30 seconds later. There is no way they were fresh.

The seaweed was soft and wet and not crisp like we're used to. Really disappointed.

The Shrimp Tempura came out and the shrimp were EXTRA SMALL. About half the size of the shrimp that they used to use. Also, they brought out the tempura sauce in the little dish you use to mix wasabi and soy sauce and wasn't nearly enough to finish the meal.

Everything that was fried was not crispy and was oily and soggy. The tempura and gyoza were both this way and not enjoyable.

+How to go to Charbar:
As I see it, there's two ways to have the best Charbar experience that anyone could have. I think it's important to commit to one or the other and not try to mix the two so you don't cheat yourself out of something special.

1. The All In - 

Make a special evening of it and plan to spend your whole time here. It took quite a long time for each dish to make its way to our table, but as we weren't in a hurry, it was very easy to roll with it and enjoy our time here. Fall in love with, and learn everything you can about the food, the staff, the building and the Charbar concept. By now, you've probably learned that it's in the Simmons Mattress heritage building in the East Village - that it's a one of a kind shared space between other local business icons Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters and Sidewalk Citizen Bakery. You'll probably also have learned how this symbiotic building sharing lets Charbar serve up bread and coffee directly from the source. But this is just the tip of the ice berg! 

If the building interests you, make sure you ask for a tour. They've got a wealth of stories all the way from the history of the space, to the challenges involved in cleaning out a century old mattress feather chute, to installing a brand new elevator in a building with hundred year old wood floors. 

If the food interests you (and it will,) make sure to learn about Chef Jessica's time spent in Argentina and how it has influenced the Charbar menu. Learn about the traditional Argentinian fire ovens and seem them in action. The coolest part? None of this is insider info I'm passing your way. Chef Jessica is actively bouncing from table to table, introducing dishes and telling you about her downright artistic visions. We felt like total rockstars and at the same time were trying our best not to fanboy/girl right out at having such a rockstar chef come to our table.

Also hopping from table to table making everyone feel welcome, was one of Charbar's owners, Connie - She's so lovely! As ""The Yelp Guy,"" I had met Connie before, so in an attempt to keep my review as honest as possible, I tried to sneak past her, but it didn't work. When she spotted me, I made her promise that our table wouldn't receive any special treatment and I honestly don't think we did... But what I hadn't counted on is that it is very clearly everyone at Charbar's goal to make every single person's experience the most special. Did we receive special treatment? Oh heck yeah - but not above and beyond what any of the other tables could have expected, only above and beyond what anyone could expect from other restaurants. Connie's passion for everything that goes on within Charbar's walls is completely contagious. There's a story behind everything at Charbar, much of which is still ongoing. (As a result they've kept lots of space open on their ""inspiration wall"" to continue the story as it evolves, but that's enough from me, go learn from her.) Charbar is the collective result of many many years experience and loving dedication to the restaurant world and she's happy to share it with you and wants you to have the best time at her restaurant in a way that is completely honest and authentic. What's also really incredible is how this enthusiasm seems to get past along to all the Charbar staff (at least the ones I talked to). Our server (David) really seemed to love being involved with such a great restaurant and some excellent suggestions.

After dinner, maybe, maybe if you're up to it, you'll be able to talk yourself and your dinner guests into a fat saunter down the river walk, but hopefully you'll be so full of tasty goodness that you won't know what to do with yourself. Uncomfortable yes, but you'll know you'll have done it right.

2. The Drinkin', Light Bitin', Raw Bar Experience

I haven't done this yet, but you can bet that I will. The cocktails we had during our dinner experience were excellent and I'd love to hit up an after work session here for a few of these and to dive into their raw bar. By now, you may have heard about their incredible rood top patio, overlooking the bow river. It's pretty easy to say this would be an excellent spot to grab a few drinks in the sunshine, or even in the evening as the river path is lit so colourfully, and enjoy some light bites. You should note that they have a different menu for the patio. Instead of running food upstairs, they have another open concept kitchen complete with a smaller version of the Argentinian grill. This would make for some high quality foodie compliments to your patio session, but for the full dinner experience, sit inside. Rev limit",2015-08-12 20:30:07

You can't afford to have dinner at P.F. Chang's very often.. And you're not adventurous enough to try out the local mom and pop eateries.  What are you supposed to do?

Well, if this is you, there's a few options..
You can either settle, make more money, or get over your fears.

Luckily though, life doesn't have to be that difficult, and Pei Wei exists, making this dilemma a non-issue really.

This place offers the fast preparation of Panda, and the gourmet style of Chang's at a price most would consider reasonable. I'd definitely say it's fair for the food you get.

The food always comes out hot and fresh, made to order. The veggies are crisp and colorful, rich in flavor. I've never had any meat that wasn't tender.

I recommend the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. It's a juicy chicken, lightly fried and tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce.  It's sweet at first but has a nice little bite to it. Not hot by any stretch, but definitely has some spice.  

Thai dynamite is another similar spicy chicken dish I enjoy. I have a hard time deciding between these two.

I always order brown rice because A) it's healthier B)Pei Wei offers it .. and  C) they do it well.

For something a little more fun, though, I recommend their lo mein noodles.

Like all great Asian establishments, pei Wei has hot chili paste for your dining pleasure. This wonderful hot sauce is one of the few things on earth I consider to be pure and altogether good to the soul.  What sets Pei Wei apart is the fact that they have dozens of bowls of this stuff available for you to pick up at the bar to bring to your table. Just help yourself!! And don't mind if I do... I easily drain a whole bowl each time.

They have those nifty futuristic robot time machine drink dispensers with the screen that lets you invent any crazy flavored fountain drink you can think of.  That's cool and all, but I'm a tea drinker on most days. Pei Wei has an outstanding selection for folks like me. I recommend the Mandarin iced green tea. With a lemon wedge this stuff is so refreshing and satisfying to the taste buds. A perfect companion to the fresh food you'll likely receive.

This location is always immaculate, and my food is always delivered with a smile. 

If your hungry for some fast Asian food, don't overthink it.. Head on over to Pei Wei",2015-08-25 10:47:52

I cant find it...do I call and its pan Asia...so I ask oh did you change the name? The girl says no I dont think so...any ways we decide to eat here and go in. The place was pretty empty, just another couple at the bar.

  The waitress quickly comes over and gives us menus and drinks. So right on the top of the menu it says ...formally simply noodles?  I realize  that our waitress is the one who answered tbe phone. I asked about the special that was on the chalkboard and she turns to the other patron at the bar and asked him to explain it to me? It was some chicken over cucumber salad..so she adds..well I have only sold one of those so I don't know if its very good. Really?

 So I ask about some other dishes and end up ordering a shrimp and chicken curry noodle ..my husband orders a beef noodle dish ... both were delicious!   

                                      Neither dish was exactly as yge waitress discribed them. But honestly really good food. I love that I could've sat at the bar and watched the food being prepared.             

What I dont love is families sitting at the bar with 4 teanagers.  So the bar area is cool for watching the chef...but it is a full bar. I mean 3 girls came in and sat at the bar telling the waitress that they have a party of 5. About 5 minutes later the parents come in with another young girl...but what if there were no parents? Either way. ..not cool.

So 5 stars for the delicious food and the chef who knows the menu:)

Albacore Tuna crudo, sundried tomato, basil, capers and celery

Chinatown - Spina Ave

I've passed Red Bowl several times, but was always on my way somewhere, and never had a chance to try it out.  What convinced me was the giant sign outside that read ""$5 Lunch Specials"". 

(Obviously I was on to something, because over the course of 5 minutes, I saw at least 3 people come in just for take-out lunch.)

 For 5 bucks, you get an entree with white or brown rice, an egg or spring roll and an iced tea.  5 bucks!  That's cheaper than going to Panda Express. (Just remember there are only 4 or 5 options for the special.) 

I got the chicken and broccoli with brown rice, and was surprised to find it surprisingly satisfying.  It's the typical savory brown sauce found in many of those Americanized beef and broccoli dishes. 

Brown rice took up half the Styrofoam container, and the entree took up the other side.  This was a generous portion. 

The egg roll was typical as well, light, crispy deep fried.  However, the sauce that came with it was bizarre.  It looked like tahini...and has the consistency of tahini, but had a definite mayonnaise base flavor. 

This was a minor thing, and for 5 dollars ($5.40 with tax) I'm not compaining. (BTW: I learned this is a family owned business, based out of Carey, NC. The hostess says they're ""famous"" for this $5 lunch.)  Don't know if I'd ever go out of my way for Red Bowl, but if I'm ever in the area, and in need of a cheap, quick, lunch, I'm in.",2011-08-17 17:07:32

Now lets get to the bulk, the steaks. I had a 12 oz filet which was a great cut of meat.  I asked for medium and they cooked it perfectly.  The perfect amount of pink on the inside. My other coworker got the 22oz cowboy cut which was just absurd.  His skinny butt somehow finished the whole thing.  Beyond this, the service was outstanding.

I love the plateau area and this cozy brunch spot is another reason why. There was no line but not sure if this is the norm. The place was not too big and seemed to be a garage before which is common of many restaurants here. The colour scheme is quite simple with blocks of red and white and just a few trendy pieces. The menu was organized into three main sections: savoury crepes, sweet crepes and eggs Benedict. I automatically narrowed in on the eggs Benedict and ordered Le Bleue which has blue cheese, walnuts and prosciutto. I'm usually not a big fan of blue cheese but decided to be adventurous that day. All eggs Benedict comes with a tray of yogurt, fruits, fried potatoes, and coffee. Just looking at the tray made me happy and opened up my appetite for the main. The blue cheese was definitely more palatable with the prosciutto and eggs but I have to be honest, it got too heavy by the end so just a warning if you're not a huge fan of the blue. I also tried the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which I would recommend as well, you can never go wrong with smoked salmon.

Either make a friend, bring a friend, or curse out the restaurant for being sexist and taking 5 steps back toward gender equality.  That said, the atmosphere allows for a very relaxing time, and it's perfect for a beer after work.  If you have a few bucks, some time, and want air conditioning, it's a good place to go.  That said, there's tons of waitresses, and I swear that 9 out of 10 of them are under 21 and thus can't serve alcohol.  This leads to one poor workhorse serving 40 customers.

It's on the second level of the park in the southwest corner of the park. It's accessible either by stairs or elevator. I visited the Perch for the first time during the evening on the weekend with a party of three.

Atmosphere: Hip, bright, and new!
Being merely seated in the Perch, either outside or inside, is a great experience, in my personal opinion. The combination of the bright lights from the evening outdoors and the colorful backdrop of the pink-and-yellow-lit bar display created a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. I think it was very clever that the napkin ""holder"" also doubled as a fold-out menu, so the Perch gets bonus points for creativity.

Service: Stellar!
The waiter we had this evening was very nice to us. One of my patrons wanted to retake a picture that the waiter had taken of us and our waiter kindly did so.

Food: Great! 
The margherita pizza was light yet delicious. A friend of mine had the chipotle burger and it looked pretty appetizing from where I was sitting. It all was served within a reasonable time of ordering the food.

I was extremely impressed by the space--exposed brick walls, eclectic art and acasual but upscale ambience. Huge parking lot, though at peak hours you may still find yourself looking for a spot. No reservations. Expect to wait if you come during peak hours.

I love that the brewing machinery is in the dining area, just separated by a glass window and if you get there at the right time you can watch them at work.

The beer was good but not amazing. I am a pale ale/IPA kinda gal and neither of them really impressed me. 

The food is...inventive. Expect to have soup served in test tubes and salads brought to you in plastic orbs. The presentation is over-the-top and maybe a little pretentious--and the prices certainly reflect this.

Our chicken and waffle sushi was a little cold by the time it got to our table, but was absolutely delicious.

The beer cheese (pretzel sticks and cheese dip) is the perfect over-indulgent treat, especially after a rough night and honestly may have been my favorite part of the lunch.

The duck quesadilla was delicious but much smaller than I expected and not nearly enough food for a lunch meal (even with the beer cheese appetizer).

The burgers are huge and delicious (according to the boyfriend) and perhaps the only modestly priced fare on the menu ($9).

The only thing I was flat out not a fan of was the Steak and Papaya Martini. The flavors seemed disjointed and there was much more vegetable than steak and papaya.

Order the tater tots. I have never had homemade tater tots or really any different than the standard frozen kind and these blew me away.

The excessive wait times -we waited over two hours (and this seems to be one of the shorter wait times from the reviews) for our deep dish pizza - need to be addressed.

At the very least, get free Wi-Fi and install power plugs at every table so we can use our devices to write Yelp reviews and pass the time before the food arrives. 

The food is mediocre. We had ""the special"" pizza and it was bland for all of the veggies and meats and thick sauce on top. We also signed up for the e-club to enjoy a free appetizer (bruschetta) - which was decent. The tomatoes were fresh but the ""toast"" was soggy. Given the enormous wait times - a manager comped the table near us with a gift card - they should have been giving everyone free apps and drinks. We literally took note of all of the filled tables around the restaurant and none of them had food on them - that's never a good sign at a restaurant. Ever.

I've never seen seating like this in Toronto and it's perfect for date night (especially if the date is going well and if not, yikes! Eat fast). There's nothing more I hate than being ten feet away from your dinner companion at a table feeling interviewey. Thank you for making eating intimate again, whoever the designer of those bench/table combos are. There's an upstairs too but I like downstairs so get there early if you can. It books up fast because it's a small restaurant.  Bonus points for being in Baldwin Village and the lovely staff. 

WE ATE/DRANK
Solid margaritas here. 
The sope - so, so good. Especially in the winter. 
The chicken tinga tostada - bestill my heart. Wish we got another one of these. 
Flank steak salad - good but not my favourite. As above, got a second tinga tostada. 
Flourless chocolate cake - I wanted chocolate and this did not disappoint but next time I'm getting the liquid chocolate. Limone over this cake but it was fun to share both.
Carlote de limone - my dining companion ate this up. Has a really nice zest to it that left a lasting impression on the meal, overall. Plus, it's not huge!

I will start with the fun factor :-).    This place offers many things to many different people.   
Downstairs - There is a a restaurant, bar, and bowling.    This reminds me of many of the bowling / clubs I have been to (Lucky Strikes, Tora (where there is bull riding), etc...).

Upstairs - There is more bowling, a bar where there is live music, a movie theater with an incredibly large screen.    Many things to do if you are in to it.

I went to see Uncle Kracker play.   They are still working out the kinks in my opinion.   Uncle Kracker played and half the tv's in the bar were still tuned to ESPN and Fox News.    They will quickly turned the tv's to the musician after a request was made.    

The fun factor rates high.    The drink prices are more than what you would expect.

Parking is terrible.   There are signs asking you not to park in the shopping center lot.   

Food
The food is not very good.    I have had their version of big bang shrimp (shrimp with a tempura batter, deep fried), seared ahi tuna, and nachos.    Shrimp and ahi tuna will only be ordered again after providing the wait staff special instructions (cook / sear).   The nachos are really bad.   Thin chips with movie quality cheese sauce (They are cheap).

I will go back if I am with a group for drinks (decent beer selection) and live music.   I will not dine there - they should remove the restaurant and put in another bar / feature live acoustic acts.

Summary:
Fun Events:  Good / Fun.   
Prices: Pre-made Long Islands were $9 per... pretty expensive   Beers run $5-7.
Food:  Bad.  Order at your own risk.
Service:  Good until they get busy.   The staff when I have been there have been overwhelmed or disorganized.
Parking:  Terrible

Having been tricked by the signs for at least that long now, if not longer, he thought it was open a couple of weeks ago and swung by on his lunch break to grab a few slices.

Today we went for the first time at lunchtime.  The place was completely empty except for us and we were able to seat ourselves.  Plenty of seating, both tables and booths.  There are some flat screen tv's in the middle of the dining room.  Overall, decor was very nice and the place is spotless.  

We were greeted with smiles by the staff and immediately a waitress in training came over with her trainer to give menus and take our drink order.  

I tried 2 plain cheese slices and my husband had cheese ravioli with bolognese.  Before getting our meal we were given complimentary bread sticks, which were warm but a bit ""chewy"".  The marinara dipping sauce seemed typical but good.  

My husband enjoyed his ravioli and, for $8.95, it was a pretty decent sized portion.  As for the slices... well I expected to be more impressed by a place with ""New York"" in the name.  At the risk of sounding harsh, they were really no better than something I'd find at pizza hut, except maybe that the crust was a ""crust above"".  The slice was thicker than I'd hoped and there was this overly thick layer of cheese.  Definitely failed the cheese to sauce ratio that is so important to a slice of NY pizza.  The sauce was bland.  

I had an issue where they refilled my soda and it was just a watered down version of Coke.  I told my waitress and she apologized and offered to get me a new one, so no problem there.  But we were already out the door.

I had been a regular at the one in Tempe many years ago. I will give 1 star because the waitress was nice. The food on the other hand, absolutely atrocious! Spinach and artichoke dip was water, pure runny water with NO flavor. My fiancé had a piece of cake for desert and it was straight out of the freezer, with a nice cardboard flavor. I had a philly cheese steak, the meat was a bit of a grey color, but I thought maybe it was the cheese sauce that was on the meat. I ate half the sandwich, and took the other half home. Later that evening my fiancé became ill and the next morning I become ill. I looked at the sandwich that I had brought home and was now in the refrigerator. The meat was grey and looked horrible! It looked like boiled meat. Needless to say we will not be back! EVER!

To start off the evening, I came in to have dinner with my boyfriend and his family. The service was slow at first but that was completely understandable because there was only one person taking care of the entire restaurant.

They offered a variety of flavors of hummus, which they are known for: original, jalapeño and ghost pepper. The texture was so smooth and creamy. But my favorite part was the warm fluffy bread they served with it. The owner kept coming by to give us more. It was impossible to resist myself from breaking open the warm pita and plowing it in my mouth.

For the main course, I ordered the kafta (ground sirloin mixed with onions, parsley and spices) which reminded me of a koobideh kabab. It was served with a side of rice and onions. While it was flavorful, it wasn't the best kabob I've ever had. 

Dessert is what blew my mind. We had the custard filled Shabiet! Served warm, the crunchy layers of pastry flaked and melded perfectly with the creamy custard.

It was quite a spacious cafe with counter seating along the windows and more seating in the back of the cafe too.  It was a bigger and comfortable space than their downtown location for sure!

There was a constant flow of customers when we were here and we watched the staff for a bit preparing the orders for the customers which included matcha drinks and plating the baked goods.  They didn't have the Swiss rolls here or many desserts for that matter.

We ended up ordering the Matcha Cookie Puff and the Matcha Daifuku.  (Prior to placing our order, we actually watched the staff restock these matcha goods (from a full tray that was stored under the counter since they were running low) and rearranging their display baked goods too.

The Matcha Cookie Puff is ""crispy outside with original Matcha cream filling"".  This was crispy indeed and the inside was full of creamy matcha filling!  It was really good!  The matcha was dense as I remembered Tsujiri's matcha to be.

The Matcha Daifuku is a ""mix of modern style with filling of original Matcha cream"".  Daifuku is like a soft mochi sweet dessert that's soft and chewy.  I was really pleasantly surprised with how soft this was!  The skin of the daifuku was airy and so silky soft.  When I bit into it, it was like it melted into my mouth with the oozing matcha cream.  I was very impressed.

We noticed that after the batch of Matcha Cookie Puffs were sold out, the staff didn't replenish any more into the display case even though we had previously seen that they had more under the counter.  They moved the remaining baked goods together and it didn't seem like they were going to make room for the Matcha Cookie Puffs anymore in the display counter.

It's hidden in a corner of the 2nd floor of what looks like an office building on 7850 Woodbine, just south of the 407. The only reason why I ended up at this place is because I was at iDarts that evening, and recognized the Chix N Stix logo from a few friends on Instagram (well done on the social media front, guys).

The menu is here is pretty well summed up in the restaurant's name. They sell chix (Korean fried chicken, to be specific), and stix (a variety of skewers). They also have some side dishes as well as a sous vide steak that you have to preorder. 

Not being too hungry, my part of 3 ordered the sweet n spicy half Korean fried chicken ($16, $11 special on Sundays!), pork belly wrapped kimchi stix ($6/2) and Korean marinated beef stix ($7/2). We also tried the spicy lamb stix ($1/pc on Wed/Thurs!). 

The service was quite fast. We received our food as it was prepared, within 5-7 minutes or so. 

The first item to come was the KFC. It was served in approximately 8-10 large spherical pieces. The twice-fried skin was crispy, and the white meat underneath was very juicy and moist. I think the skin could have been crispier, but the flavour was so good I didn't mind.

Next, the stix. The pork belly wrapped kimchi was the most ""out-there"" item on the menu. In reality, the pork belly wrapped around the kimchi resembled bacon. However, the flavour was distinct. It meshed very well together. 

The lamb was my favourite - it was a much thicker and juicier cut than most lamb skewers that can be had at this price. I'd highly recommend their Wednesday/Thursday offer for $1/pc!

Lastly, the Korean marinated beef skewers were on point - a classic. Can't go wrong with that. 

The prices here were very reasonable. I'm not from the area so I won't be back often, but I'll definitely make a return visit when I can.",2015-12-29 17:29:07

Atmosphere: The restaurant is the perfect size. It's not overly large, but it's not tiny either, but could easily fill up with a few large parties or several couples. It's super dim, though, so if you do not enjoy eating in the dark, then you may want to find a table with many candles nearby. Otherwise, it's adorable inside, updated but modern and fresh. Also, since this restaurant is on 17th and off the East Carson path, you don't feel as though you're in the middle of the Southside dealing with every college kid that just discovered alcohol. 

Service: The servers and owner (who I got to meet) were wonderful. They know the menu and also care. I think due to the size of the place, it's manageable for them to not be overwhelmed and spread thin.

Food: Let me tell you ... I had the Butternut Squash Gnocchi with Boar Ragu and I'm still thinking about it. The gnocchi were absolutely fresh and probably the best I've ever had. They melted in my mouth and I did not want them to end. The boar ragu was also incredibly fresh and the pairing was something I would have never been able to produce in my own mind. I'm being dramatic, but I truly enjoyed it and I made that apparent by eating every last bite and then licking up the sauce on the plate with leftover bread. 

We finished with the chocolate bread pudding and it was the best decision. It was a little more like a molten lava cake and a quick bread,  so it was not overly ""pudding"" esque. My opinion is that if a restaurant has bread pudding as a dessert, then you should get it cause it's probably amazing. Few places dare make bread pudding because either they know some people see it as outdated, but nowadays I feel it can be so unique. The only other place that rivaled this option was NOLA... they used to have a red velvet bread pudding that may be one of the greatest desserts I've ever had, but I digress.

Delicious food with beautiful presentations, nice ambiance, super friendly staff and excellent services!! We had the four course 'Yu' tasting menu with a complimentary chef's dessert, every single dish was to die for. So here's a bit of recap:

1st course - seared halibut 
2nd course - trio of sashimi - tuna tartar, Japanese amberjack, and Japanese sea scallops
3rd course - 'grill your own steak' (you literally get your personal japanese styled grill and started cooking however the way you want your meat to be!
4th course -  sushi nigiri - blue fin tuna, atlantic trout, white shrimp, japanese horse mackerel, toro (tuna's belly) and one other japanese fish that I couldn't remember the name...
dessert - housemade pudding/custard with many kinds of fresh fruit - YUMMMM!!

What we had today might not be yours even if you ask for the same four course tasting menu because the chef receives different fish and other ingredients based on availability and seasons, but no matter what you have, i'm sure it'll be just as amazing.

No flavor at all. I attached a picture and I had to zoom in as the shrimp were so miniscule. Probably smaller than the chopped tomatoes.

I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich with a side of cheesy grits. The turkey on the sandwich was good ... fresh carved style.

I came here yesterday to purchase a cup of tea, but what I encountered was a high pressured sales experience!

Recently I noticed that Starbucks bought Teavana and I decide to give it a try.  Teavana is located across the street from my office in Kierland. I went inside and asked about their Rooibos or other white teas.  It was too late in the day for a Oolong and I wanted something light.  

When we lived in Seattle, I use to enjoy stopping at Peet's Coffee & Teas in Fremont. http://www.yelp.com/biz/peets-coffee-and-tea-seattle-2 Their selection was outstanding and I had high hopes for Teavana.

I vaguely remember hearing stories of the hard sell employed here.  Sadly, they were all true.

I came in and asked if they sold hot tea, or were they strictly a bulk outlet. No, I was told they did both.  Great!  I asked if they carried any Rooibos, or other white teas and I was shown some strong black teas and Oolongs.  ""Danger Will Robinson"", I thought.  I corrected the salesperson and said I wanted something lighter, that didn't have as much caffeine. 

Well, this went on for a while, but I finally purchased a Grande size cup of one of their teas for $5.45. It took ten minutes, after several false started.  As I was leaving, I tasted a samplers outside and decided to get some tea for home.  The tea I like, Samurai Chai Maté wasn't sold in a bag and  I was informed that I needed to purchase one of their tins for $7.00!  Hmm, okay I thought.

I asked for a small amount to take home.  They filled the tin and I was told that would be $56.00. I said empty half the can and then it was $34.00. So I asked how much was it an ounce and was told $6.30.  In the end, I paid $19.53 for 3.1 oz and along with my $7.00 tin including taxes it came to $27.57.

I've skipped the blow by blow dialogue. In sales, these tactics are called the ""Assumptive Close"". It's where the salesperson, assumes you want the largest amount, or a fully loaded car, er tea -- until they are corrected. It can be exasperating and somewhat annoying.

In the future, I'll pass and stick to Starbucks. I never thought I would ever say that!",2013-03-13 16:31:32

Quite a steal for $25 per month compared to $92 per month at Lifetime where the classes are not that great and unless you take advantage of child care, basketball courts, their pool, etc why pay for stuff you don't need?

When I received my photos they were all dark and we blended in the background but the proofs were completely the opposite.  

Ok so I let it go trying to give them benefit of the doubt.  

Second time was more than a year later for my son's 1st birthday photos.  This was really bad ~ the sales person is different from the last time and she was rudest person.  She rushed the pictorial and wouldn't allow a family shot because ""per company policy"" can only take 12-15 shots.  Bogus!!

It seemed to us that the crispy onion topping was more like wimpy and greasy. We would have preferred actually crispy thin onion rings. We left most of them behind. We did really enjoy the fat free zingy dressing! I'm not at all a fan of their pizza as it is a super thin almost cracker type crust. 

They ONLY offer a slice of pizza or pasta for the kids!! No chicken strips or burgers. Our guy doesn't like pasta. One super thin crust pizza is not enough for our kid to get full!! Luckily, he ate some of our cheese bread to fill up or we would have had to order him more food! I do like that they offer a side of broccoli for kids and that was a good choice to offer at only 89 cents!!

The place was packed on on a Saturday night at 6:00!! There was a wait out the door, so apparently people enjoy the food more than we do! Lots and lots of people ordering pizza so it appears that others very much enjoy it, unlike us. 

Again, for us it was such a positive experience that we will likely go back periodically. Maybe we can find something on the menu that wows us if we keep trying!! We left satisfied but wanting it to be a bit better next time!",2016-10-23 13:59:15

Honestly, the employees are grouchy only one guy who works there (African American guy is the only one who ever smiles and appears to enjoy their job.), the food is never consistent and the prices are ridiculous. We have been coming here since they opened, about once every two weeks. It's literally never the same everytime we come. The portions are all over the place, the baked goods (from outside vendors are also not consistent) and people just generally seem grouchy. I get it's early and it's a weekend but I do not want my $5 SIDE of bacon to be cold, hard and overcooked unless I ask for it that way. Also when you walk it up front and ask the grouchy girl for new side and the cooks are all mad and making remarks that's inappropriate. The place isn't cheap, you can't get out of there with two medium portioned breakfasts and two drinks for under $40. The outdoor area is great for parties and kids (they have a splash pad), but if you hate your job and can't smile then probably just quit.

The burger patty itself was delicious, although I do not think the waitress understood what Medium Well (Yes I know you're supposed to eat Well Done for ground beef) meant.  She just asked me ""Pink?"".  Being a food snob, actually kind of irked me.  The rest of the burger and fries was very mediocre.  They need to add at least 3x the lettuce in their burgers and make sure it's actually still crisp to a degree.  Cooking the lettuce on top of the burger removes the crunch sorely needed from a hamburger and makes the topping feel like a wet noodle.  Other than that, I'm sure they'll improve overtime.  Now the real reason anyone should bother coming here is their nice selection of craft brews.  I ordered an Amber, and although it tasted delicious, it tasted exactly like Fat Tire.  Then I went to their Prickly Pear beer, and that actually had a very unique taste to it.  The place still looks too much like Hayashi, but I'll give it time.  The price costs about $1-$2 dollars more than usual, and the beers do add up.  I will need to return here for happy hour and see the prices then.

The food isn't just cheap, it's also delicious. I've tried a lot of different things and it's all pretty authentic.

But it never happened. Coming here 5 times - every steak was phenomenal, martinis were never anything less than tasty, the service was always impeccable, the live entertainment was consistently classy, and every experience was top notch. It should come as no surprise to anyone but it is without a doubt, Green Valley Ranch's best restaurant.

It started with their 5-7 happy hour. Sitting by the bar and enjoying the piano ballads / live jazz, while sipping away with colleagues / clients on some of their killer martinis. From the dry glass to the exotic flair, I have always enjoyed their lychee and koi martinis. Every sip was smooth and the potency of the after taste made for a great finish. As one goes further into Henderson, these places just don't seem to exist.

When it was evident the drinks would be taking a toll, it was on occasion, some complimentary bar food from the generous bartenders. If it wasn't drinks on the house, it was sides from the kitchen. A creamy and no frills mac and cheese, some cream spinach, an incredibly tasty lobster chowder, and a fresh, yet plump variety of shrimp with some cocktail sauce. After too many chowders / bisques, along with some of the best crab cakes in Sin City, did I finally decide to shoot for what they're known for best: Steak.

I started small with a petite filet mignon, which for $40 was a bit more paltry than I had hoped. But any meat with the words ""petite"" or ""small cut"" is going to be a pricier, albeit unsatisfying portion for any serious carnivore. Instead of focusing on its size, I switched it to its taste, which was nothing less than foodgasmic. Charred bits, smooth textures, and juicy meat at its finest. I eventually moved onto to the full sized 9oz filet($46) and the prime rib New York ($45), both of which had me going gaga for more.

Then there's the grand daddy. It's name is the Tomahawk Ribeye ($95) and while its a portion for two, I think I can gladly take it on by myself. It reminds me of something Tarzan or Fred Flintstone would eat - a hilarious hunk of meat on a bone, with a smell that ignites hunger for even the most casual meat eater. Paired with a gorgonzola crust ($8) and seared foie gras ($19) to add to the meal and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes, and its both a vegans worst nightmare and a glutton's finest moment.

After a 9 hr drive, we checked into our room and headed here for an early dinner. We had reservations and was greeted by the manager who seemed to be covering for the female greeter who returned to seat us. He wasn't friendly at all. 

Our server, Angie was friendly at the onset. I had planned to eat the same items I ate from 2015 - fried calamari with linguine with clams and white wine sauce. Hubby ordered the chicken pasta special with wine pairing. 

The calamari was great with the marinara sauce or lemon juice. We had already consumed a bread knot with EVOO and balsamic vinegar but ate all the calamari too. I was disappointed when my entree arrived in red sauce. I told the server I ordered the white sauce and she insisted I ordered red. She did offer to remake it but I didn't want to see food go to waste and you never know what they might do to your food later.  Hubby told her he heard me ask for white sauce. So I told her I'll keep it even tho I didn't want the red sauce. It came with about 30 small clams some had rocks and sand in them so I had to spit them out.
She never came back to check on us and I overheard her offer cheese to the table next to us when their entrees arrived after ours but she never offered us cheese for our entrees. I don't like it when servers don't repeat your order back to make sure they got it right. That's crucial to do if you're trained properly and then insist the customer ordered something they didn't.

Still execution could be better and I wouldn't necessarily wait again for it.

Souther Style Nachos - Fried chicken skins with cheese. This should be a grand slam in the you like rich food at a biological level, yet the chicken skins get soggy quick and the cheese congeals. There has to be a way to make the cheese less solid and the chicken more so.

Gyro - Not as good as town tavern, maybe better than showmars but that's no standard to go by.

Southern Fried Chicken Wings - these were legitimately great. Good size, juicy through the middle, great breading. Get them if you go.

Pork Belly Tacos - I like the watermelon on it but the texture is much to hard. The whole point of pork belly is to have it be incredibly soft. If you over cook it, or cook it at too high of a heat and it gets rough you might as well eat a healthier cut of pork.

Serrano and Machego Crustini - Bread was too thick and not toasted enough resulting in a pretty doughy concoction.

Anchovy Fries - Chinese people do this with smelt and it works a lot better. Anchovies don't have the consistency to not get soggy and really just end up being too soggy. I grew up eating these at home and was really disappointed 

Lamb Meatballs - Just too tough. Probably needs more bread and less time in the oven.

Flatbread - Too rich, not enough texture.

These reviews may sound too hash but if you're going to try to do new an interesting things basic execution is paramount. The positive is that these are all problems that can be fixed with practice while good ideas don't' come out of nowhere.",2012-08-07 02:01:26

Our water then arrives, and i love cucumber water so I was pumped, WAS. I looked over and there was a bug the size of a fingernail in my water. After I noticed this I flagged down our waitress and received a new water. and they comp'ed an appetizer to try and make it right.

They used most of the bones of the Sahara so a lot of things are in the same place they were previously and this includes the buffet.  

Now, if you were ever at the buffet when it was the Sahara, I am so sorry.  I made that mistake once and never again.  There was a reason they were doing dinners for $6.99 lets leave it at that.  As part of my wanderings I went past the buffet and the delicious smells made me decide to give it a go.  

They did not move or add any stations from the old Sahara buffet but they did update them and the food is on the complete opposite end of the scale from the old.  Everything I tried there was either very good or excellent.  It is small compared to a lot of the other strip buffets but it still has a decent variety.  

They had both the large platters to serve yourself and small plates available for other items.  They also offer their signature cocktails in a menu on the table along with beer and wine for purchase.  My server was friendly and attentive and so were the others from what I could see.  

Was it a bit on the expensive side for what was available? Yes, which is why I only gave it three stars.  I got there just before they switched to dinner so I paid the brunch fee of about $33 with tax.  If you wanted champagne you could do a bottomless glass for an additional $12 but it did not come with the brunch. 

If you are staying there, it may be worth a visit but I would not make the buffet a dinner destination.",2014-09-01 21:19:19

There are different options for eating which is also nice. Uncle Sams, Burgatory, EnP, Aladdins(!!), Ichiban, Wendys, McD's as well as Chili's. I also think I'm forgetting a few.. so yes for an outdoor strip mall this one has tons of options for eating.

While here, I also enjoy checking out the bookstore, Bed Bath & Beyond, Five Below(!!!!!) as well as Old Navy. Clearly I enjoy this ""mall"" It may not be for everyone, but I like it!

Jardin's menu and beautiful patio initially attracted us to dine here, so we decided to try it for dinner one evening during our most recent trip.  We were seated quickly without any reservations, but after being guided to a table on the patio, the hostess left and the service issues began.  

From the beginning of service until we paid the bill, we were disappointed.  Our server largely ignored us, not being able to offer much helpful information about the menu or the wine list, making us feel like more of an imposition than an invited guest.  We had to flag her down several times throughout the meal to order appetizers, entrees & wine, and even to request our check (which took more than 15 minutes).  Other service members were not helpful or seemingly willing to help), so eventually we just gave up hope that service would recover and tried to enjoy our meal.

Thankfully, the food was delicious.  There were not many seafood entrees, but of those offered, the bouillabaisse was the best, filled with tender squid and buttery scallops, a surprisingly light and delicate dish that really challenged the idea of what a bouillabaisse should be.  The hamburger was also well-liked, definitely filling by itself or with a generous side of fries (it does not come with fries, so if you want them, be sure to order them as a side).

Overall, if you are in a hurry, Jardin is not your best bet...but if you have time to kill and really want to enjoy the beauty of the Encore/Wynn gardens, then Jardin may be your #1 pick!

I was quickly seated since the restaurant was mostly empty. The interior of the restaurant has definitely seen better days, there were several flat screen tvs showing anime. The menu consisted mostly of, surprise, noodles. Noodles with soup, noodles without soup. There were also appetizers of wontons, egg rolls, pickled vegetables (including kim chi), etc. 

I ordered wonton soup (5 wontons for $2.50), pickled cucumbers ($1.75), and zha jiang mien ($7.50 I think). The wontons were excellent: thin skins, finely minced pork and shrimp, not too large or small. The price was definitely unbeatable for a bowl of wontons. The pickled cucumbers were above average. They were ice cold (+), still very crisp (+), and lots of garlic (+). They were however a little on the salty side (-).
The zha jiang mien was also above average. The noodles were chewy, firm, and absorbed the sauce nicely. Everything I expected from hand-pulled noodles. The fermented black bean sauce had lots of ground pork and black bean flavor

Service was neither terrific nor terrible, it was efficient. The only downside of the meal was paying the bill. You are forced to go to the counter to pay, so before going to pay I calculated my subtotal and left approximately 20%: $2. After paying for my meal at the counter I collected my change and proceeded to leave. The host/waitress stopped me and asked how I enjoyed my meal. I told her it was fine, to which she responded, ""oh then you should leave a 15%-20% tip."" Really?! First, I did leave a tip, but your system of paying for the bill doesn't allow you at the register to see it at the table. Second, even living in the US, I thought tips were voluntary? Is it really a tip if it is not voluntary? Anyway, it was a bit of a downer to an otherwise enjoyable meal. This is a good place to come for hand-pulled noodles...if you are prepared to leave a tip, if not don't bother, I guess.",2013-08-26 05:03:01

The Pros:  
1.  Online check-in and check-in kiosks are super easy and fast.
2.  Location; it's in a great spot right next to all of the Linq stuff, across from Caesars and right in the middle of the strip.

The Cons:
1.  The Hilton timeshare pimps are unrelentingly RUDE and bother you every chance they get on your way to and from your rooms.  SO NOT FUN!
2.  Our room, was just nasty.  Broken tile in the bathroom, brown splashes of what (??) on the floor under the counter in the bathroom, bathtub/shower that does not drain, dirty shower curtains, toilet wobbles when you sit on it, broken fan in the bathroom.  Just gross all over.
3.  Everyone hates ""resort fees"" in Las Vegas but now you have to pay for parking (valet at least, which is new) on top of your resort fees.  If you don't pay for the valet parking, good luck finding a place to park in the parking structure.  So on top of your room rates, expect another $45 plus per day for resort fees and parking.
4.  In-room internet connection.  WEAK.  And if you want the upgraded connection for another $8 per day, it is still near dial-up speeds.

My two favorite things about this fitness club is that there is always a cardio machine that I WANT to use any time of day I go and I can always find a spot in the group classes even if its five minutes before or after the class starts which was unheard of at my other gym.

The cardio and weight equipment:
The cardio equipment is on the first floor and is always in pristine condition and if by the rare chance I see a machine that is out-of-order, its fixed in 24 hours. There are 5 Stairmaster stepmill machines in addition to two traditional Stairmaster. There are 12-15 treadmills (with personal tv's) including a few unique treadmills, several elliptical machines, recumbent bikes (that have personal fans), and stationary bicycles.  I will say that this area can get a little hot because the ceiling is not high, but this is the only compliant I have about Gainey Village.

The workout group class:
 These are the reason I signed up in the first place. They offer sssssooooo many yoga class that I have never taken, barre class, mat pilates, cycle/spin, zumba, and a few others . The instructors are awesome and will help with proper form even if they have a packed class; they make the effort which is always appreciated by me!

The locker rooms:
 Amazing! They have everything you could every need to shower and transition into non-gym attire. Complementary disposable showers, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, body spray, mouthwash, cotton balls, q-tips, hair dryers, etc. There are private ""getting ready"" areas away from the lockers with mirrors galore so you can get your hair perfect! Also in the locker rooms are a sauna, steam room, and hot tub, all private in the ladies locker room (men have a private facilities too). I love that they offer cold towels on ice outside of the steam and sauna area! Oh, they also have two fun little swimsuit water extractor machines.

Others:
There is also a café where you can relax between cardio and class sessions, a small boutique where you can buy cute workout gear or casual wear for both men and women.  In the center of the club is a full sized basketball court and along the western wall are squash,/racquetball courts. There is a kids club which always looks like they are having fun. On the second floor there is a small running track and outside there is a lap pool. The Gainey Village also has a full  service salon and spa  (being a member of the Village grants you discounts on all services, sweet) and a Chiropractor's office! Also, there are always activities put on by the Village that occur outside the facility, like hiking trips, stand up paddle boarding, happy hour get-togethers and so much more!

Can't really comment on the namesake as I havent gotten that yet. 

Now, when we said we wanted a boba shake, water and some honey toast our server made a face and was kinda pissy about it I guess because we weren't there to eat or didn't order one honey toast each.

The food is absolutely fabulous. It is the very definition of home made. It tastes as though it was made in some one's home kitchen, some one with a lot of culinary skill. The Enchilada Plate, Chile Rellenos and the ""Mixteca Wrap"" are definitely my all time favorites. 

The service is phenomenal, top notch, couldn't be any better. The owner is often in there busting his ass in the kitchen and even taking people their orders or helping however he can, he's very hands on and seems very friendly to his staff, which goes to explain why they themselves are so incredibly friendly and cook such amazing food.

On Saturday nights they hose a huge classic car show in the K-mart parking lot that they share. What better than live music, cool old cars and the best Mexican food in Phoenix? If there was a 6th star, I would give it to Mixteca.",2015-02-28 15:56:40

I really like that they found such a cool way to use up the space in the building. The restaurant is very spacious with two floors. With that said, the area where they greet you is super awkward, lots of traffic and just confusing in general. While standing there, I had three different people try to assist me and then leave me half way through to assist other people who were equally as confused as I. Hopefully this gets better in time. 

The menu on paper looked extremely appealing. We were all pretty excited to try the dishes.. And then pretty disappointed. The food first of all took quite a long time to come out. The place wasn't even packed, so I'd hate to wait for my food on a night the place was full. And second of all, the presentation was awful. I had the sturgeon ($36 by the way, for one individual portion) and it was plated with a sauce. It wasn't bad but definitely not worth $36 for anyone. We also had the short ribs with eggs and it literally looked like they just threw on the eggs and threw on three pieces of small ribs. So disappointing. 

The parking in east village is a bit hectic as the place is still growing. There's a small parking lot next to the restaurant but most definitely not enough to accommodate for all the customers for the Simmons building. Lots of street parking and another paid parking lot further down from the building. I would advise going on Sunday or after 6 pm when parking is free.

I had the crispy basil chicken (level 3 hot) and Jon had the shrimp stirfry (level 1 hot).

I love me some Pittsburgh and to be able to proudly wear a shirt that boasts the city in any way is ideal for me.  I would wear these shirts every single day if I could and of course if I didn't have to wash them.  My favorite shirt, which I am sad to say, they do not make at this time, is simply a skyline of the city with a heart behind it that says, ""I left my heart in Pittsburgh.""

A four star review seems high for what this place is, but a three star seems too low. But I am giving it 4 based on ridiculously cheap prices and tasty food quality and the rest is just ancillary.

Taco Tuesday and Wing Wednesday bring me back to this little dive over and over. This isn't your typical Taco Tuesday in Cleveland, where you only can choose from a few tacos. There are probably 15-20 choices that sometimes rotate, sometimes repeat. Last night I had the Ancho Chicken, Chipotle Pulled Pork, and Chicken Paprikash tacos. I'm usually squeamish about ordering meats and such in divey places but the flavors and quality seem pretty high. Lettuce, tomato, and cheese top all tacos, you choose your meat fillings (a few veggie choices, too), hard or soft shell, and sour cream and/or salsa. Beers are German and I usually split a giant stein with a friend, but last night I opted for a normal size beer. So, three tasty tacos and beer = $7. Seriously. $7. Wing Wednesday is a similiar set up with several wing choices, both dry and wet style. I love the wings but I haven't been going as often since wings make my clothes shrink.  

Ambiance and service? Well, remember you are eating good food on the cheap. Corners have to be cut somewhere. This is a super old historical bar that could be quaint, but sadly, is pretty rough around the edges. It did appear that they recently painted and repaired some ceiling damage. But the tables are old school cheap bar tables and it's very, very dark inside. And service varies from average to slow. Best bets are to sit right at the bar for quicker attention. It gets packed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I don't think the kitchen can quite handle the volume efficiently during peak hours, but that's ok. Remember... $7 for really flavorful tacos and a quality German beer. Just know going in that this isn't fast food. And if you chose not to go? That's ok.

We walked in at 1:45pm, there was a 3 top sat at a table on the lower level, they were already eating, and there was a 2 top sat in a booth, that was it. We opted for a booth. The Hostess took our drink order and brought us our diet soda and iced tea, she told us our server would be right with us. Well... by right with us, she meant 15 minutes later! When the server came over she asked awkwardly if she could get us something to drink, then said nevermind you have drinks, I meant to eat. I told her we were on a bit of a time crunch and asked how long a cheese pizza would take, she said 10 minutes. We ordered a 12"" Cheese Pizza and Fettuccini Alfredo, add 2 meatballs.
We sat and watched the minutes tick away, with no sight of our server, and after 17 minutes we were ready to walk out, but as I was going to get up, she was behind me with our food. 
Pizza looked and tasted great!! Really good pizza, worth the wait. The Alfredo was nothing to write home about and the meatballs were pretty bad; they were hard, dry and crunchy on the outside. Crunchy meatballs? No juice or tenderness at all, needed a fork and knife to cut them. I had to ask for marinara sauce just to hydrate them a bit. We immediately asked for the check, paid and left.

Otherwise, it's your typical obnoxious 20 somethings kinda bar that serves its purpose, to get drunks to hang out and order cheap bar food. God knows why or how this chain has lasted so long, it's really nothing that special and there are way better cantinas and mexican style dives to go to.

You can't expect too much from a little cantina that caters to 25 year old drunks, but you should expect a tiny bit of quality in service or at least edible food. The food is typical generic bar food that happens to have a few tomatoes and cheese passed off as mexican. The tacos are small and falling apart and are the same thing you'd find at a del taco, for 3 bucks more. The chicken wings are disgusting...DISGUSTING. Take a good wing, throw it on the street, let it get run over and dusty in the hot sun, then re-fry it and let it turn rock hard, and that's what dos gringos has for wings,  I kid you not. The absolute grossest and inedible bar food ever. If you come to this place you better only order hard alcohol, because the beer is gross and flat, I don't know how a bar can manage to screw up beer, but they sure did here. I never felt more cheated out of cash then when I spent it here on this stuff, I never ask for a refund, but if I did this would be the first time.

I used to get dragged here a lot years ago by drunk buddies, and honestly nothing has improved or changed since. When you arrive it will take at least 30 minutes to get a proper order going, the service is slow and ignorant of people. If you show up on a busy weekend night, you will wait forever, but the sad thing is if you show up on a slow night on a weeknight, you will still wait forever. The servers are all over the place, they don't seem to have sections or areas they just wander all over and pick people to wait on in no organized fashion. The last time I went here with people I had a server or bar-back whatever he was take a drink order and an ice water, after waiting 15 minutes, (and the bar was only like 50 feet away) he brings me my beer and a flat water in a tiny plastic cup and gives the party of young girls next to us tall plastic glasses with tons of ice and smiles. I guess he figured I wasn't a single 21 year old girl so I didn't matter. After that he vanished and 10 minutes later I got a girl server who was okay and made things fast enough. No complaints with her, she did her job, I just wish she showed up first and not the dude who already left a bad impression. He was some arrogant british dude with the puffed out chest attitude, he flirted with all the tables full of girls but could not give a c-r-a-p about anyone else, especially us guys.  I hate arrogant servers, bars or not, get your head out of your butt and grow up, cause guess what pal? good service=tips, bad service=no tips. Any good server knows that if you want to do well, you show a good attitude and be nice, don't treat people like they are lowly little peasants there to stare at the miracle that is you. FAIL. If that's your kind of attitude go work for abercrombie and fitch in a mall in scottsdale seriously.

What can you say? It's a dive bar for the young drunk people of chandler and scottsdale to hang out in, that's really all there is to it. It's a place your drunk buddies drag you to. If getting wasted on tequila or corona is your thing, then this place works, otherwise it's a hot, crumby little dive with nothing else around it and you'd be smart to go elsewhere like mill ave or downtown phoenix.

I'm a fair reviewer too, I don't give low grades for nothing...the service was slow, I sat around texting and waiting too long, I waited a total of 25 minutes to get 1 beer and an ice water, it took 2 servers to make that happen for my group, the food was absolutely stale, and that's it. I'm really surprised to see the 4 and 5 star reviews, these people must have written them while drunk, its the only way DG can get a 5 star.

I will never be dragged here or come here again, the last time was the last straw of many past straws. Yuck dude.",2013-06-12 20:25:08

Evening was highlighting Joseph Phelps Vineyards and the executive chef's mastery of course paring.  Chef Charlie did an outstanding menu and the wines sampled were marvelous.  Started with a roasted Brussel sprouts salad with sliced apples, honey pecans and a jasmine honey vinaigrette--this was a simple salad with several sliced red apples and pecans light and easy.  Salad was pared with 2014 Joseph Phelps Freestone Sonoma Coast Chardonnay--I usually do not care for Chardonnay; however, this one did not have the heavy buttery and oakiness associated with most Chardonnays, found this to be very enjoyable.  Second course was a braised veal cheek atop a black truffle polenta, accompanied with spigarello broccoli all with a wonderful tarragon demi sauce.  This course was fantastic, the veal was extremely moist and tender with the polenta providing a good base to this dish.  This course was pared with 2013 Joseph Phelps Freestone Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir--this was a wonderful pinot.  The fish course was Black Bass--a flakey and buttery fish--served with a Kabocha Squash-- Asian variety of winter squash, a Japanese pumpkin--with a sweet and fluffy, chestnut-texture--served with quince and black trumpet mushrooms.  This course was outstanding, presentation and flavors, textures were perfect.  This was pared with 2014 Joseph Phelps St Helena Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc.  The main course was Red Wine marinated Flat Iron Steak with parsnip puree, Thumbelina carrots and praised fennel Bordelaise--a fabulous brown sauce flavored with red wine and shallots and garnished with poached marrow and parsley.  The steak prepared perfectly and was very tender with the correct amount of seasonings and the overall course was magnificent.  This was pared with 2013 Joseph Phelps Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  The dessert course was almond gianduja bar--an Italian confection made of chocolate and 30% hazelnut paste with almonds.  Served with sour cream ice cream with gold foil garnish and spice meringue drops with berry gelee.  This was a light, delicate sweet but tart dessert.  Pared with 2013 Joseph Phelps insignia--one of the great Bordeaux blends.  Had a delightful time at this wine dinner--as always, the wines and the food were excellent.  Thank you to Hank's for a great time.",2016-09-30 18:51:10

My husband and I went last night on our date night. The restaurant is clean and modern looking. We were greeted by one of the owners (it's owned by 2 brothers). 
The brothers were so personable and fun. They make you feel like you're an old friend and were always available for drink refills or for extra mint chutney! 
We ordered a variety of food. We started with the vegetable snack plate that had a variety of deep fried yummy snacks. Very good and nicely seasoned.
The goat curry is delicious. The goat meat is so tender and the sauce is yummy. We ordered the basmati rice which was light and fluffy. The shrimp korma.... I will sing the praises of this dish! The shrimp were fork tender and the gravy is the ultimate comfort food! Order the garlic naan so you can soak up all the goodness with it! 
We were given a sample of the sweet mango lassi. It was thick and creamy. I could have downed a gallon of the stuff easy! 
We opted for some dessert to round out our meal. We ordered the gulab jamun and the pistachio kulfi. The gulab jamun was good. A little more dense than I like. But the kulfi.... wow! It was so delicious! You HAVE to try it!

The restaurant is really elegantly decked out and I almost felt I was at a Chinese wedding.  There were tons of people there on Monday night mostly Chinese which is a great sign.  We ordered the Peking Duck with wraps and Ginger Chicken and the Sweet and Sour Pork with mixed vegetables.

The Duck at $36 was supposed to feed 10 people but it wasn't a very large portion, it didn't event compare to the portion of the Peking Duck served at the Shanghai.  I was really hungry so any food at this point was exciting.  The chicken was nice and crispy and the pork was good too. These three plates and a huge bucket of rice came at around $75.  The man at this restaurant put a place of food on our table claiming I had order it which I didn't.  He said it was only $5 if I ordered the Peking Duck but it alone was $15.  I said I didn't really care how much it was I hadn't ordered it, he insisted I try it again and again I felt badgered into eating something that I didn't order.  He finally took it back and I graciously got the bill.

Aside from the forcing of food and small portions, it was a good meal and the waitresses there are very pleasant.  The interior is quite gorgeous so it really enhances the meal.  For Chinese food however there are just as delicious restaurants at more affordable prices",2010-02-24 17:39:15

I came here on a weekday night and basically spent a good 8 minutes looking at the menu (although I already spent almost a half hour at home looking at it), and finally decided to go with the a special of the day. I can't specifically remember the name but it was something like "" Holly would I don't"" I believe and had steak, mozzarella sticks, dirty sauce, and a plethora of other miscellaneous ingredients. I got it on Dutch crunch bread as others had suggested and got it with their chips. This is where it went a little downhill, it might have been my fault because I waited until I got home to eat it, but I thought the bread was just awful. It was weirdly doughy an nearly inedible (again, if might have been my fault), and I was still greatly looking forward to the inside until I realized that the ingredients themselves all sounded and were delicious, but as a whole, the sandwich was just, awkward I guess. It just tasted like I was eating a steak and a mozzarella stick. That is not something I want to pay $15 for. 

It might have been because I made a poor choice of sandwich, but I'm not yet sold on Ike's. 

Pros
- amazing service, the guy working was super amicable and fun to talk to while I was waiting for my sandwich
- great chips (they make their own)
- fun and relaxed ambience
- giant sandwiches
- lots of variety

Firstly the location is fantastic.  Right downtown off the subway and just outside the Eaton Centre, it's pretty darn easy to get to.  When you find yourself needing a memory card, or work done on a laptop, it's nice not having to drive to Suburbia and deal with a generic firm on their terms.

Secondly, the staff are decently knowledgeable.  The Geek Squad service department has always been prompt and helpful and have helped me out of a jam or two.  The floor staff also know where things are.  You'd think that wouldn't be a tall order, but I've been to a few other big-box stores and have thought the staff knew what they were doing until I realized that the universal remote they were trying to sell me was in fact a garage door opener.

Lastly, the best thing about this place, as with all other Best Buys, the staff are not on commission.  There's nothing worse than just wanting to browse and go through the racks of a store unmolested and seeing the sales staff circle you like sharks after a good chumming.

The reason? Like most of these places, it's cheap produce that undercuts the chain supermarkets, and Marche Lobo is also relatively clean and orderly.

We went to dinner on a Saturday because a few friends of ours had a Groupon. I think it was $50 for $100 worth of food, which wasn't bad at all. With the groupon, we got 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, 2 naans and 4 desserts. Let me tell you, this was enough food for 8 people. 

First came the papad, which is a fried appetizer of sorts. It kind of resembles a chip, but with Indian spices and sauces. Next, we ordered a variety of appetizers. I got the vegetable platter, which included a samosa, a veggie pakora, a paneer pakora and sort of a potato patty. For $6, I was expecting something more than just 4 pieces, but it was still very good. Everything was perfectly spiced. 

For entrees, I ordered the Shahi paneer at a medium spice level. It was the perfect amount of heat, and you weren't overwhelmed. It was so delicious, and I was definitely eating it with a spoon. We got two orders of garlic naan, which was THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER. Seriously, if you haven't ever tried garlic naan, you're missing out on life.  It was a perfect accompaniment with every entree. The rest of the table got the chana masala, indo-chinese chili paneer, and malai kofta. All were very good. We also got a few drinks as well, such as their chai and mango lassi. Delicious! For dessert, we were given the option of kheer (kind of like a rice pudding) and gulab jamun (sort of like fried donuts soaked in a sugar syrup). They were both good, but by that time, we couldn't eat anymore.

They give you a variety of choices for fillings. Lots of different meat choices, as well as a few choices on the beans. I love that they have stir-fried vegetables as an option, so it's not all raw veggies going into your burrito. I also like the variety of different salsas. I tried the medium, and it was spiiiicy.

Mabel is more than just great bread, Mabel's sweets and squares are the best! I wish I could say I've tried more of them - they all look so tantalizing - but I love the peanut-butter-rice-crispies-chocolate-triangle thing so much, I can't stray unless I get that PLUS a second thing. So I also know that the peanut butter cookies held together by caramel cream are incredible, too. (Most of the squares are in the $3 range.) I should at least try all the peanut butter things, they seem to have peanut butter nailed.

Since it's Easter Sunday today, I thought I should get with the holiday and have a hot cross bun. Mabel's had these strewn about the store, stacked in the bread area, another huge tray on the floor, a platter near the cash. $2.25 each, and were soft, fresh, just sticky enough. (I ate it with a coffee from Tim's down the street... where I brazenly asked for butter and a knife that I used on my hot cross bun - thanks, Tim's, I owe you one).

The only thing I haven't loved from Mabel's is the sausage roll. The pastry itself was superb, but the sausage was so over-herbed (floral and perfumey) that I couldn't eat it. (And maybe was a touch overpriced for a single roll, too, around $5.50.)",2017-04-16 19:37:12

If you've been to Cafe Porta Alba in Hilldale Mall then this restaurant should be pretty familiar.  It's from the same people, the food is very similar, but this is basically the express version.  The pizzas on average are 10"" instead of 12"", but the bonus to this is that they are virtually the same size, they cost less ($8-9~ for a pie) and they have the same level of tasty quality.

That's really what's best about Novanta.  For those not familiar, Novanta and Cafe Porta Alba have a specialty oven that cooks their pizzas at 900 degrees and which was imported from Italy.  They have a rare Italian certification that only some 50 places in the U.S. have for being allowed to serve this Neopolitan Pizza.  It allows them to make your pizza in roughly 90 seconds, so wait times are fairly low for dinner (about 10-15 minutes after you order).  They use fantastic fresh ingredients with just enough choices on the menu to wet your pallet and a burnt, crispy, kneaded crust that is delicious.  It's a great portion size in my opinion; usually most people order one pizza for themselves, which gives you 4 reasonably big slices.  But since the dough is thin except at the point of the crust you will be comfortably full, not wondering why you ordered a whole pie for yourself.

As for selection, they have a few different routes you can go, the ones I described above have about 9-10 menu choices followed by another group with alternative styles (no sauce/4-cheese, deluxe salads, gelato, etc).  The Salccicia (sp) with Mushrooms, Olive Oil, Basil, Crumbled Sausage, and Garlic is incredibly good as is their plainer Margherita pizza with Bufala Mozzarella.  And if you don't like their options they do allow you to build your own.  The taste of all of the ones I've tried is light, full of flavor, with an appetizing amount of oil and crispiness that help you savor the last few bites.  

The only bad marks are the location and lack of atmosphere.  While I'm appreciative that they opened this near my apartment, the bigger restaurant in Hilldale has a slightly more intimate feel and actual restaurant service as opposed to ordering at a counter.  The strip mall that Novanta is at is growing increasingly popular and has a really bad parking lot, so on occassion there's too many impatient drivers and swarms of little kids.  The decor inside is also bland, there's a few stock photos on the wall from Italy but otherwise it's very much the same as the Chipotle and Chins next door.  I'll give them time to improve this though, as they literally just opened and the cheaper price over Porta de Alba makes this a very agreeable place to frequent.  My wife and I had drinks and pizza for roughly $20 and tipped a few bucks at the counter jar as opposed to an actual waiter/waitress 20%+.

I recently had Pizza Bruta too, but both my wife and I liked Novanta and Porta Alba much better.  Not that Bruta is bad, it was decent, but it has the same atmosphere as Novanta with sub-par taste.

The pizza is definitely worth a stop for at Novanta.  Stop by ad give it a try and if you have room there's ice cream to wash it down with.  They even have a Nutella-Stuffed pizza that I'm really tempted to get next time I'm there.",2013-07-08 02:21:57

Lo and behold, I was right. The first thing I noticed was how different silver dragon is from the other Chinese restaurants I've visited. We were greeted warmly and our server wore a classy, if not retro Vegas-y uniform. We were given water immediately and a few minutes later our order was taken. Our table shared the salt and pepper squid, the veggie chow mein and stir fried veg. 
The S&P squid was decent. Instead of bing spiced with hot pepper flakes it came served under jalapeño peppers and onions. The squid was crunchy but lacked any saltiness. The noodles and veg were pretty standard too, but I swear our veg was cooked in GASP!  . . . Butter!

However, it had caught my attention not too long ago that they offer $8.99 lunch specials Monday - Friday from 11am-3pm. So for post-exam celebrations, this place has now risen to one of my go-to's (my friends and I are getting tired of always going to Pickle Barrel)! The dish that I almost always order is the shrimp tacos which come with three generously loaded tacos + a side of seasoned rice. Not to mention, this IS Red Lobster after all and you can get unlimited signature biscuits for free! The biscuits may be a little on the salty side but they're buttery, smell great, and are served immediately after seated which is great for satiating any initial starvation. The atmosphere is great, the servers are always cheerful and polite, and the location is indoor/close to the downtown core. 

The only thing I would advise against is the shrimp nachos. My friends and I split for it and although yes, there were many shrimps, the shrimps were tiny and didn't give that fulfilling crunchy mouthfeel that you get from larger shrimps (like the ones they put in the tacos). Also, the nacho chips that they used were not that tasty. Quite bland and not crunchy enough. Worst of all was the cheesy. They used the melted processed cheese that you get when you order nachos in the movie theaters. Yuck! At a place like the Red Lobster where almost all of their seafood is doused in melted high quality cheese, you would think they'd use it on their nachos too!

The 777 roll was supposedly spicy soft shell crab but again (please see pic), the majority of the filling was fake crab/kani and not the soft shell crab. The small amount of crab that it was in there was mushy and not have the texture of freshly fried crab. 

Quality was very low for a nice restaurant inside a (busy) casino. And I have to agree with my husband, people will check the restaurant out usually during happy hour.

Food is expensive here and I already knew this because I went to the Zen at the old location.  My friend and I both went with the omakase sushi meal that comes with two appetizers, your 14 pieces of sushi (chef choice) and a dessert.  The overall experience was wonderful, when every dish came, the server would carefully explain what they are and how are they made.  I was super impressed with the sushi, the chef lined them up from the weakest flavour to strongest so you truly taste the freshness and uniqueness of each sushi by ensuring one does not over shadow the one previously. The 14 sushi were all amazing and I can't really tell you which one i loved the most!

I highly recommend this place if you want a more traditional Japanese sushi experience and of course for a special occasion due to the steep price.

Food wise, I'd only give it a 3.5 overall. If you order the right dishes, it's a 4 star, otherwise, it's really just a 3. So choose wisely.

I would NOT suggest the dumpling soup with rice cake dish. Even though I actually liked their frozen dumplings, it wasn't even fully cooked when they brought it out. It was fine after we soaked it in the soup for a while, but that was not the most pleasant experience when you want some nice warm soup. Also, their hotpot combo dish isn't the best in the world. We got the one with beef, ham, and veggies. It's the cheapest combo, and you can tell they do also provide you with the cheapest quality of meat. Chewy beef and spam, not exactly what I had in mind just reading their descriptions.

However, they do a very nice job with the pork bellies. It came out sliced really thin. (4 stars for the thin slices) I hope you know how to cook them yourself because they seem to have a shortage of staff members to help you cook sometimes.

We ordered:
- Japanese style braised pork belly with hard boiled egg and spinach (special)
- nankotsu (soft bone) yakitori: a little on the salty side, but we'll flavoured!
- waygu beef yakitori
- black cod robata
- teba gyoza (deep fried chicken stuffed dumpling)
- ebi chili
- maguro and salmon sushi
- eel avocado sushi roll
- zaru-soba (cold soba noodle with dipping soup)

The highlight me was the chicken wing. I originally thought it was going to be gimmicky, but it was actually well-flavoured and pretty different from everything else we had. The soft bone yakitori was good as well, but salty. The waygu was okay, but probably not really worth it. Several items were quite greasy though.

The ebi chili was kind of a mess - it was far too sour for my liking (like sambal sauce, but with extra vinegar) and was overly sauced such that I couldn't even taste the shrimp. The zaru soba was good, but the dipping sauce was too light, and we ended up mixing it with the sauce from the braised pork belly (OH SO FATTY) to help bring out the flavours.

It's an okay place overall - the service was really good, and it's clearly popular. Since I'm preggos, I chose not to eat any of the sushi dishes, but the eel avocado roll was quite yummy. Would I come back? Not too sure - probably not without an occassion, as the items we sampled weren't enough to make me really want to make a second trip here. But it's a decent addition to the little j-town area. Best of luck to them!",2015-02-15 23:25:00

The store feels cleaner and I'm noticing a better selection of items and best of all, it is close and accordingly, for small items, I still shop here. It is not my primary grocery source (Sunflower Market on Southern and McClintock gets most of that business) but for staple items, I do stop in here.

The meat selection is still one of the best deals in town and I hope the store continues to evolve and capture more of the new and emerging business in the area.

Come to find out they simply moved locations! how happy was I! 

I finally got a chance to get over there, I live in Henderson and it's quite a jaunt but for me, well worth it.

My favorite meal there is the 7 courses of beef.... it's enough for two people and absolutely tasty... 

First you get a very fresh tasting beef salad. Next you get a  hot pot where you cook thinly sliced pieces of beef to your preferred doneness.. with that you get rice papers so you can make your own spring rolls with them along with lots of fresh vegetables. 

then you get a plate full of little rolled up morsels of beef 

and then you get a ball of beef filled with glass noodles peppercorns and LOVE.

after that you get a bowl of amazing beef soup... it's really flavorful and a perfect end to the meal.

I haven't read any reviews of people who have tried the 7 courses... I encourage everyone to give it a try..

I should mention that the owner came to my table and acknowledged that he hasn't seen me in awhile! I explained to him that I was out of state for awhile and he graciously accepted my return.... I can't wait to eat here again... I love this place and I hope you do too once you give it a try.

I've added photos to the ball of beef steamed in banana leaf and filled with love!

I would also like to point out that I don't think that any business should get 1 star just because they changed their hours when YOU wanted to go there but couldn't because they were closed. 

it's pretty tough out there right now for a lot of people, and giving a business 1 star and leaving a review about them being closed is a pretty terrible practice that should be avoided because it just isn't fair..... At least try a place and give honest feedback about your experience there before you give negative posts.",2012-09-03 09:17:05

This small but great (modern) Mexican joint in Cleveland lacks somewhat on room, but makes up for in atmosphere and really great food. The menu doesn't appear too big, but when you do it right, it doesn't matter. They have only two sections for entrees, one being all tacos (no matter what you call them on the menu) served in a semi traditional manner, as they have peppers, onions, protein, served with corn tortillas. 
The first time I went, the guacamole was the biggest disappointment, and it wasn't bad, just lack the promised (or implied at least) crab in the crab and corn guacamole. This time however we tried the guacamole sampler, and it was great. We actually found a decent bit of the mix ins in our guac, and didn't have to guess which was which, as there was a lot of the flavor of the trout and bacon, and pineapple, etc. 
The margarita and tequila selection are as extensive as they are delicious. The house margarita with cucumber is pretty amazing (especially since I don't eat cucumbers), and refreshing. I just stuck to that as it was different, but others tried the blood orange which was great, and traditional, none of which were lacking in alcohol. 
We did family style yesterday, and since we got apps, and knew we were getting dessert, were just got 3 dinners for 5 of us this time, as ordering an entree each last time, there were tons of left overs. We tried the duck (again) which is phenomenal, and the brisket covered in coffee, which was very good, but thought the carnitas we had last time was better. Both of those were taco style, and lastly we ordered the pork chop dinner, which got rave reviews from everyone, and I thought was tasty, but just not a chop guy myself really, but the rub and mole that accompanied were great. 
If I had to use one word to describe my desert, the Caporitada, it would have to be supermegacrazyawesome.... It really defies one standard word obviously. It is a bread pudding with raisins and cinnamon, and JALAPENOS, but done right, its not too spicy, but had a great savory element to it, and I have ordered it both times, and have been very happy, only thinking it could use some sort of anglaise (or more if there is one on there, as it is all absorbed in by the time it makes its way to the table.

FOOD: 
I wouldn't order the carne asada taco again, not because of the size, but the flavor wasn't there for me. Same with my tostada, it was tasty not the best I've had but it did the trick. I'd recommend this restaurant for a large party because they serve big hearty portions and are reasonably priced. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Not the worst but honestly couldn't really ask my waitress for salt because there was loud mariachi playing non-stop. I love music and all but it became irritating, I couldn't hear what anybody at my table was saying. If your trying to go somewhere quiet on Sunday this isn't the spot!  Lol

I have only had one problem since coming here so much in the past 6 weeks.  I ordered a ""you pick 2"" to-go.  They called my name and I took my order back to my office.  Well, there must have two Lindsey's because I ordered the Tomato, Mozz & Basil Panini and Creamy Chicken & Rice Soup but received a Chicken Caesar Salad and a Bacon Turkey Bravo.

Today I had a craving for noodles and then decided to go have lunch at Nudo.

The setting of this restaurant is extremely simple but the output is a bowl which perfectly balances noodles, vegetables and BBQ Pork. I ordered mine ""dry"", meaning the broth is served on the side. If you are a fan of spices... do add some of the red pepper flakes infused oil - this truly adds to the flavor of the noodles.

Dear Ralph,

Thanks for your email. I was your waitress Sunday night. After you left I did ask with regards to the coupon and learned I should not have taken it off the childrens menu. I do apologize for that. Coupons are valid on the entree items only that are not on special. On the coupon it states 
""Not valid with any other specials"" With that being said, Your coupon would not have been valid on your chicken marsala dinners. I was not aware you were unhappy with your dinners or I certainly would have offered to remake them, or get you something else in its place. The coupon would not have been valid on your hoagie purchase as its a sandwich.

I'm sorry your visit to Ann's was not what you have come to expect. If I can do anything else please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thanks

The staff really were not intrusive at all - in fact I didn't even see anyone working other than the cashiers - this isn't a bad thing - just means that they blended in and just let you shop away.

My only compliant was that they had racks of quality merchandise and the prices on those racks sometimes were higher then the items when marked on clearance at their normal retail locations. Sometimes I think folks who work at thrift stores know good stuff and than because of that little bit of knowledge - they end up over-pricing stuff. 

Just because it says American Eagle or Hollister - it doesn't mean it's marked quite that high at their retails stores. Same with J Crew - BR - Lucky.

Note: If you don't typically like children at restaurants, don't go before 8:00pm on a Friday. Once the kiddies left, the lights were dimmed, candles were lit on the table and it was THE perfect atmosphere for a Friday night out.

The food: I ordered a Cuban sandwich. I love these, so I figured, how can you screw one of these up? Well, it wasn't hard. I've lived in Florida, so I know what a Cuban sandwich should be like. First off, you only get half a sandwich. The bread was kind of hard and chewy (Could barely cut it with a knife), only a very small (and I mean very small) portion of pork on it (shredded), and some ham that I think came from a grocery store pre packaged. Not even deli cut ham. I only received one pickle on my sandwich. The fries were starting to get cold by the time my meal made it to the table. The iced tea was good. I do think that for the price, it could have been better. They should fix the meat and add some black beans and rice as a second side dish.

Before I mention my sandwich, I'll admit that my tastes are really plain so that may skew things and not be totally representative of what you can get here.  I went for the Philly cheese steak sandwich on wheat.  The service takes a few minutes because everything is cooked up fresh.  I thought it was a little bland.  Granted I didn't get any mayo or other dressing but the meat itself could have had a little more umph to it.  It was also a tad on the rubbery side.  Also, the bread was too soft. Toasting can go a long way.

I've never had Cambodian food and so we asked the owner to give us some recommendations. He suggested we try the pan fried noodles. We got the pan fried beef noodles, Cambodian spicy. I almost died. 

The spice is not the kind of spice that just tickles your mouth. This is the kind of spice that rocks your world and then stays. It's the fact that it stays that really overwhelms your mouth. So I had to get one of their fresh smoothies to help cool down my mouth. I got the guanabana, which I had never had before. I always like to order things that are different and new, but when I don't like them, I tend to hand it over to my boyfriend. I wasn't a huge fan of the guanabana. It is very light, barely sweet, but has this strange after taste. I described it as fishy, but my boyfriend says he couldn't taste it. I guess it's a matter of taste. 

Overall, the experience was okay. I liked the food, but the smoothies weren't really my thing. Also, I think because I didn't drink it and my boyfriend did, he ended up getting sick. I don't think it was anything wrong with the food, but the guanabana is some crazy beast. Drink at your own risk.

I asked for a new pizza and she told me no. Finally she said they would make a new one and then she told me I had to pay for extra toppings! Are you kidding me!? I just wasted gas having to drive back and fourth. Then as I'm leaving she says thank you have a good day in a snarky voice.

So you can imagine it was the most delicious hot dog ever. It might have been the alcohol, it might not have been I can't say for sure.  BUT I do crave it so maybe there was something there. 

When Ty told me there was one going up in the container park I told him it was a must!  Plus little man loves the playground there so he never days no. We went on a Saturday which is normally busy but we think the gloomy weather may have had something to do with it because the amount of people were manageable. 

As you walk by the giant praying mantis into the park, cheffinis is located past the coffee shop on the left side where the old pork and beans was. If you've ever been in it before you know how absurdly small it is. They replaced the long middle table for three tall tables on one side and a short table that stretches the length of the window.  The menu is available above the order counter. The selections varied slightly and came with preselected toppings. There was an option to get a naked dog and add two toppings of your choice plus sauces for the price of $4.99. For me that's normally what I would go for, but the El Mexicano stood out to me. That will run you $6.99 not including drink or side. 

El Mexicano - this was a bacon wrapped all beef dog (you have the option of beef, turkey or vegan)  with a cherry pepper relish, green sauce, garlic aioli,  Chipotle guava, onions, tomatoes, avocado and a cilantro garnish. 

Lots of flavor and lots of spice! The hot dog was super juicy and had that snappy crunch when you bit into it. And all the toppings kept my taste buds going!  Delicious!!  We didn't try any sides and thankfully because the one hot dog was plenty. I was stuffed to the rafters. I was a bit disappointed in the iced tea we had. It tasted sour like tea does when it's old :/.  But overall a great experience and I will come back when we are in the container park.",2014-07-08 01:42:57

The first time around, we went with a large group of friends. We got the grilled cheese appetizer to start, and then I ordered the chicken and dumplings. The appetizer was rich and delicious and I have ordered it every visit since. The chicken and dumplings, however, were underwhelming, which is probably why I had forgotten about them when I went the second time and ordered them again. The chicken and dumplings is the sole reason Beckett's doesn't get a five stars from me. I mean, if the meal wasn't good the first time, and then a year later they haven't improved it or removed it from the menu, then that's your bad, Beckett's Table. Even the waiter tonight admitted to it being bland (although he said it in a much kinder way). Tonight, however, I remembered to stray from the plain, boring meal that had plagued me the two previous times, and ordered the short ribs instead. Good golly, what a difference that little meal made! It was absolutely delicious and could easily be pulled apart by my fork alone. The short ribs melted in my mouth along with the creamy mashed potatoes. Seriously good. The service tonight was also right on par. Our table of six never ran low on drinks, and our server was quite patient with all of the questions we had regarding the menu and specials. My mother-in-law enjoyed the experience tonight so much, that she asked to speak directly with the manager to tell her how wonderful the service and food was.

1st Note:  When I walked in I did realize how much I miss the bread sticks and the salad served at the table is always a great way to start a meal.

This might be my third chain review but the service deserves to be yelped about.  My server started off with an free offer for a tasting of a glass of red wine.  I said ""why not""
After dinner a manager offered a complimentary small dessert  with  choice between strawberry or lemon tart.

What an experience, I actually want to go back to this Olive garden. 

Also joan B. with one review and one star, I'm a minority, I even walked in a half hour before close and everyone seemed please greet us at restaurant.  Maybe they have shaped up their policies.

My manager and I came here to take a friend to dinner and we were spoiled! 
The staff was charming, presentable and knowledgable about what they had to offer as well as recommendations.
For appetizers - we ordered the bacon wrapped dates (which was the first time we've tried anything so creative). The sweetness of the dates and the juicy smoked flavor of the bacon complimented each other well and were amazing to start! For sides we had ordered the sweet potato with a glaze and sweet creamed corn. The softness of the sweet potato was amazing - cutting through it was like a piece of cake and just one bite melted in your mouth instantly! The sweet creamed corn was to die for - a must have for sides. The sweetness was just right and the creamy sauce reminded me of cream of mushroom soup - fulfilling and delightful :) 
For the entrees, the waiter had recommended that their steaks were the best in the country - we decided to have the filet mignon (wet dry- where the meat is vacuum sealed to retain moisture), bone in rib eye (dry age- where the meat is air aged) and bone in filet mignon. All though the dry age meats had more flavor and were delicious - all three meats were tender and aged to perfection. The cuts were smooth and fresh. 
After this amazing feast - the waiter was able to sneak in their chocolate soufflé and some hot tea and coffee. The soufflé was a lovely way to end the night - the flavor reminded me of a warm milk chocolate with little dots of chocolate inside. 
To summarize my dinner - the presentation, staff and food was phenomenal. I would recommend Anthony's Steakhouse for any occasion :)",2014-01-08 07:11:12

The hot rocks was thee highlight of my meal!  Deliciously flavored, really wished there was more of it to eat!  I love anything I get to cook myself. 3 seconds on each side perfection. Told my boyfriend I'd find him a rock outside that he could cook on for his bday gift! =P

We split a bone in ribeye... Man what a bone!  I could grab it with my whole hand and just take a bite out of the steak if I wanted. (Secretly wanted to). It was cooked perfectly on the inside. Extra charred on the outside.  If this is your thing, I would recommend it.  However it isn't my thing.  I felt like it countered the fact that I wanted my one cooked medium.

($28.99 Ala cart) Marinated to perfection and super tender as everyone else has mentioned.  I can eat this alone and be happy.

But even more appealing is that at $24.99 I can do AYCE and eat as much as i want until i'm disgusted with myself.

[There are two type of Kalbi out there: L.A. Style, and Korean Short Rib.  
The difference is the cut.  L.A. Style is is a flanken cut, but a bit thinner.  More tender and attached to 3 meagerly bones with fats and cartilages.  This may require more work esp if you like to clean the bones.. nomgry!
Wang Galbi (King Ribs) or tradition Korean Style Beef Rib is when the meat is fillet in layers away from the bone in a long flap.  Wrapped around a thick piece of bone several time and consider more genuine.] 

The best part is Woonam Jung doesn't skim and serves the tradition style Korean Short Ribs in their AYCE list as well as many other items including Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, and Bulgogi.  They sure know  how to make you feel like a guest of honor with all this fine, quality, premium meat!  

Don't be shy and ask for refills for your sides as well. The salads are well prepared in addition to all their fresh banchans. With Kimchi here being my favorite it's pretty much fat fest.


*Tip* Ask for a side of pear juice sauce for your Beef Brisket and Tongue.  I don't know what's it called, but i usually point at the ramekin with the salt and pepper sesame oil and tell them, ""the other one!""  They'll know ;]

So why a low score?   Price.  Our tab with a $10 tip was $67 for two people.  One order of lamb balls,  one order of lobster mac,  one pint, and two glasses of house chardonnay--ouch! for a funky, neighborhood bar.

Had their small party platter that came with tuna, salmon, shrimp and crab Inari (2pcs each), spicy salmon roll, California roll, shrimp tempura roll, avocado roll and cucumber roll for a total of 40 pieces that was $48. The quality of the fish wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular either. And for $1.20 per piece it wasn't worth it, especially since most of the items were veggie rolls.  I've had better variety and better quality fish in a party platter from Japango and their sister restaurant Yuzu No Hanna for a lot less. 

Also ordered two pieces of unagi sushi ($5) and a spider roll ($14).  The unagi was amazing.  I love unagi and almost always order it when I go for sushi, and this place did a great job with it.  The $14 spider roll was definitely over priced.  I normally see spider rolls priced between $11 - $13.  For $14 it should have been amazing, but it wasn't.

This truly is one of the most unique places in all of the city. Now, I am no art connoisseur, I just enjoy admiring other people's talent and perspective on life, and I think this is done so perfectly through this museum. What I'm trying to say is, whether you are an expert or novice to art, you can thoroughly enjoy this museum.

What's so fun is that all the artists are super quirky. From the circus room you can play in to the completely dark room you sit in and ""experience"" to the famous Repetitive Vision/Yayoi Kusama aka red dot/mirrored room. 

They also have two other separate buildings in the gorgeous Mexican War Street neighborhood the museum is nestled in. The War Streets themselves could be an exhibit in their own right! I LOVED the house right next to the museum with the Chiharu Shiota: Trace of Memory exhibit. It's basically a room full of intricately intwined black yarn that looks like cobwebs. Such a fascinating piece and so much work that must have gone into that!

I also thought the Julie Schenkelberg exhibit in the building right on the corner of Monterey and Samsonia Way is so intricate and almost pretty to look, even with broken dishes, furniture and everything in between piled up together.

I'd never done fondue before my first trip to The Melting Pot, having missed the 70s for a lack of, oh, you know, being alive or cognizant for most of the decade.  The cheese course is always astounding, and the server/preparer always tells me something new that I didn't know about either the preparation of the fondue or where they get the cheese or some other interesting tidbit.  (Didja know dusting the cheese in flour stops it from becoming too greasy as it melts and keeps the texture smooth?  Now ya do!)  The emmenthaler is my personal favourite.  The salad with candied walnuts, bleu cheese and raspberry viniagarette pretty much rules my life.

They have two cooking styles for the main course - Mojo and Coq au Vin.  I've tried and thoroughly enjoyed both.  The Coq au Vin is great with heavier meats like the teriyaki sirloin and the filet, and the Mojo works well with chicken and prawns.  I'm a nut for sauces and when everything is said and done, there are 7 on the table to compliment all your meats and veggies. 

Of course, the chocolate course is astounding.  I've had turtle, bananas foster, and plain old milk chocolate and all of them have been a delight.  A tray of: cheesecake, marshmallows, pound cake, pineapple, strawberries, and bananas accompanies the dessert.  Needless to say, I've waddled out of the restaurant many times.

The 4 course meal is called the Big Night Out and runs about $100 per couple with a drink.  It's worth it both for the food and the experience of doing the fondue thing.

I feel as though there is one section of the store that is an exception to this rule; I absolutely adore the women's workout clothing line.  This review focuses on the WOMEN'S ACTIVE line:

Let's face it--going to the gym is a total drag.  I mean, seriously! Who wouldn't rather remain on the couch with remote in one hand a beer in the other?  As nerdy as it sounds, one thing that helps me to stay motivated to make a gym appearance is cute outfits and feeling good about how I look.....  

First, I'd like to discus my favorite Old Navy Active product:  the Compression Pants.  Stretchy/Spandex pants sounds scary, don't they?  Have no fear--these pants hold everything together and actually have a slenderizing effect.  Don't believe me?  Try them on!  I have the capris in an array of colors. (hint:  darker colors are even more slimming)

Second, I'm a big fan of the semi-fitted tanks.  They pair nicely with the Compression Pants and fall over the hips to hide trouble spots.  Also, since they are loose, they ensure that you are not wearing an entire tight-fitted outfit.  Slim fitting tanks and tanks that bubble through the belly are also available--the latter is great for hiding troublesome abs.  

Third, the hoodies and running jackets are slim fitting and chic.  The Fall/Winter 2013 collection even features a mock zip jacket that has thumb holes that allow you to pull the sleeves down over part of your hands.  (This feature is great for chilly outdoor runs!)

No matter which piece you purchase, the price is always right.  These items are cheap enough to treat as disposable clothing--so don't be afraid to wear the heck out of them!",2013-12-17 20:20:19

I ate every.last.bite. My friend got the spicy pho ($12) and said it was amazing.

S2903i4LCSjC-GUhbLQGag,bP1-iaqAuy4tEoviQaxJrA,hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw,2,10,4,5,"Oh boy. A rare bad review. Let me state clearly that I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt. At first I thought ""Maybe it's because I'm here on (insert any day of the week but Monday)"", or maybe because ""I'm here (alone/with a date/with colleagues)"" . a half-dozen ""benefits of the doubt"". No more! I'm never going back.

No cocktails, no beer, only wine. ""Lunch Specials"" are advertised, but apparently no lunch buffet. In no way could this restaurant be considered competitive. Not in the West End of London (by far!), not in Silicon Valley, not in Washington D.C. ,  and not even in the desert wasteland of Indian Cuisine that is The Southwest Neighborhood of Las Vegas. Even in a field of 1, this restaurant doesn't rate.  

Unless you live in the Southwest Neighborhood, you would never know this place exists except for listing conglomerators with apps in the app store. And that's probably just as well . Service is consistently slow, though courteous. This is truly the only Indian restaurant west of Decatur but you would never know it. Ask for a booth or table right next to the telephone...so you can listen to the chirping of the ringer ring of the hook the -entire- length of your dinner. This is a classic example of a poorly-run restaurant that gives Las Vegas restaurants a bad name.  Why is the phone ringing off the hook? Because everybody from a 10-mile radius is ordering from one of those UHAUL-style food delivery places and this is the only Indian-cuisine restaurant in the area. Is the food authentic? Is the food fairly priced? Is the wine list good? I  think the answers to these questions is ""probably, yes"", but really what is ""authentic Indian cuisine""? If you read the original owner's numerous publicly-available print-media articles you would conclude there is no more  ""authentic Indian cuisine"" than this restaurant. I  don't think most people who are frequent customers choose to eat here because of this restaurant's value, authenticity, or wine list...and really couldn't care less about the poor service. I  think most frequent customers of this restaurant eat here because they work in the nearby Dignity Heath San Martin hospital complex, they live in the traffic-jam-central nearby housing developments of  Mountain's Edge or Rhodes Ranch (both developments notoriously crammed to the gills with more residential units than can be supported by the surrounding businesses causing huge infrastructure problems... ) or any of the mega-complex apartment villages that plague the Southwest Neighborhood. This restaurant will never attract a sufficient level of tourist traffic because of its location, and there is no alternative restaurant of this ethnic specialty within any reasonable amount of driving time, and the residents of the aforementioned housing developments and local employers like the hospital are totally accustomed to poor quality and poor service, so this business will always remain. 

The ambience of the restaurant holds no value for a romantic liaison, a business conversation, or even a large gathering like a UYE. Only those with a LOT of time on their hands come here at night. Like only retirees and families with multiple children bother coming here at night (which describes the predominant makeup of those who live in this neighbourhood). 

I  doubt anybody but the management of this restaurant and Yelpers who will never have the chance to visit this restaurant will ever read this review. That being said, I offer one piece of advice, and I  bet you can't guess what it is.... Is it ""Try the Lamb Vindaloo"" or ""Save room for a Mango Lassi""? No. It is simple: Bring a bottle of water in your purse when you come here for dinner. Better yet, just go next door to Teriyaki Madness and save your money.

(Why is this restaurant's ambience poor? The telephone ringing constantly, for starters. Secondly, the interior design seems like it was designed in some computer game like ""The Sims"" or by midgets with vengeance against tall people. Also, the second booth has cloth so thread bare the stuffing is poking out. The booths are placed so close together you have to be a little person to fit into them without feeling like the table is poking you in the stomach and I am by far certainly not a candidate for weight loss! The ""mantra"" here should be ""if you have time to lean you have time to clean"" but it is, sadly, not.)",2015-04-24 04:03:34

I was in the area and jonesing for some healthy but filling breakfast food.  Conveniently located just off 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback, I pulled in when I saw the place and joined just a handful of other peeps inside.

First of all, the ambiance of this place is right on with their name... very hippy like.  Adorning the walls are all kinds of posters including the likes of Grateful Dead, Animal House, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Led Zeppelin, and even one of Bob Marley smoking a big fat jizzoint.  There are also license plates from all over the country, an old school pinball machine, and some bicycles.

The staff was super friendly - it's the type of place where you order at the counter and they call your name when your food is ready.  I looked at the menu and debated between doing a breakfast bowl and a bowl of oatmeal with a side of scrambled egg whites.  My decision was made when I was told that indeed the oatmeal is not the instant kind.  And they even served it with soy milk and blueberries per my request.  My dining companion went with a breakfast bowl burrito style and was happy with his order too...

The only negative (which I now see is in some of the previous reviews) is that it was disappointing to eat in and have our meals served on styrofoam... not only is it not so enjoyable to eat on styrofoam, but it's very un-hippylike!  

It's worth noting that this place has more than just breakfast - they also have burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and salads... and they have free soup daily!

The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a cool vibe yet on a Friday night around 7ish it wasn't really busy (maybe 4 tables besides us?).

I asked our server and he went to check with the kitchen then came back and said ""just a few more minutes"". OK, np we were starving but patient. 10 minutes later we still didn't have our appetizers but they did eventually come out (once we received our entrees). This was not OK but we didn't say anything to our server as I said, we were really hungry. The food looked amazing but the shishito peppers were exceptionally salty, the garlic edamame was just eh because the garlic got burned (you know when you can taste that burnt garlic flavor). The Vegetable Udon was very spicy, too spicy for a few of us at the table. My roll (can't remember the name) was pretty good but my veggie roll was just ok, very small.

Aldi DOES sell spinach. Not only the hand-washed bag of spinach, but organic spinach, as well as organic kale and arugula! And for $2.50 a container- you can't really beat it.

Here are some other items that Aldi sells for insanely cheap that I LOVE:

Their spices- you CANNOT beat $1 for garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, cinnamon and Italian seasoning. Every spice I have tried, I love. These spices at other grocery stores would cost you triple.

Chicken broth- $1.79 for a carton of organic low sodium chicken broth?! A steal. I used to buy this at Trader Joe's for over $2 a carton.. now I won't go back.

PRODUCE- The produce is always fresh- baby portabella mushrooms, gala apples, avocados, pineapple... I love it all. 

Baking staples- organic sugar, flour, baking soda... all MUCH cheaper than other grocery stores.

Their simply nature line is absolutely amazing and I haven't been disappointed yet. Look out for their in-store specials! I grabbed two bags of hamburger buns for just 50 cents each right before memorial day weekend! Insane!

On a week's worth of fresh produce and other random items, I almost ALWAYS spend under $20 at Aldi. So awesome!",2015-05-21 14:53:10

Thanks to the reviews here, we took a road trip today and are so happy we did!
We got a six pack (it used to mean something entirely different when I was young) and tried the Pink Cadillac, Carrot and Peanut Butter to start.
The Pink Cadillac was wonderful, with a filling in it (frosting, filling, that is)and was just delish. The Peanut Butter was good, but every time, every place I get a peanut butter cupcake, I wish I wouldn't have...should've opted for the coconut one, after all..
Next I ate the Orangecream and it was fabulous! It was smooth and thankfully, lacked that overpowering orange flavor that some have.
The Apple Pie was delish, and on the rich side (which is right where I want my cupcakes!)...
My husband said his carrot cake cupcake was ""better than any he's had at Caketini"" . However, I still Caketini is better....
So far, I think it's a draw between the two as THE BEST.
The (darling) young man in my picture frosting cupcakes is one of the owners, and was a nice as he could be. He told me they're opening a second location in Chandler in about 30 days, so we'll be going down there when it opens. 
The Orangecream and Apple Pie were my faves...and they were perfect!!

The deli case has a side show for more serious cured meats... mortadella, sopressata, speck... but don't expect it to be sliced with the shiny new slicers behind the counter... nooo... they have to compete with the main counter for those slicers... may seem picky... until you realize your meat unit has wandered out of view and you are now competing with ~30 people waiting for Islay Ham. A manager saw us looking confused and deciding if we should move on... when we explained our plight she nodded and said, ""oh yeah, they have to use the slicers over there."" um... ok... wait to get speck until after the crush of new store special peeps.

The only other downside is the express pick up... somewhere in cosmetics there is a place to take your groceries so you can drive up and have them loaded... there were too many people to figure it out ( and it wasn't raining) so we swam up stream out of the entrance / exit... which suffers the same kind of bad traffic flow that Giant Eagles all have.

I was very well received and explained in detail the procedure, that considering that I have thick black hair on fair skin, the results would be great and I would be looking at 4 sessions + 1 extra maintenance session one year later. I agreed on a medium sized area plus a small area and paid full price in advance. 

On my first session, the therapist told me they don't use any type of topical anaesthetic because ""she needs to know when it's too much"". That left me a little bit suspicious - I thought an experienced laser therapist would KNOW exactly how much intensity they can use in order to avoid burns, instead of relying on the customer for that. It was the very first red flag. 

She proceeded to do the medium area - it was TERRIBLY PAINFUL - and *forgot* about the small area. I told her there was still more lasering to do and was told ""I must remind her about it"". 

On every single subsequent session, she forgot about the small area again. 

After four sessions, I still had hair growing back and came back for the 5th to make sure I wasn't missing something. 

Not surprisingly, the hair grew back. After three months of the last treatment, it looked like I never had done laser before. 

So, in short, I paid thousands of dollars upfront for a service that caused me pain and didn't work at all. When I called them about the problem, I was told I could schedule more sessions with a 10% discount - which I obviously didn't, I'm not paying a thousands minus 10% to get zero results again.

I cannot say anything about any of their non dim sum dishes, but they seem to be quite popular for a particular clam dish in a dark brown (perhaps oyster) sauce.  Looking around, many of the diners had ordered this dish and were thoroughly enjoying it.  Maybe an option for my next visit.

The low rating is for the customer service and knowledge that lacks from the employees. The groupon I purchased was the middle tier which included:
2 same day races for 2 people
Upgraded helmet rental
Race suit and shoes
Headsock and sticker
Autographed poster
Bottled water

when we first arrived it's pretty intuitive, walk towards the go karts and to the front desk no real signage or where to go. When I checked in I informed the lady working I had a groupon deal and she rushed to press redeem without even reading it, giving me 2 tickets, 2 head socks, and sending me on my way to watch a video. The video was located in a tent near the track with no employees there to make sure we watched it or to even press play on the DVD player. After waiting about 10 minutes I just decided to press play on my own, they had a banquet going on also so the music was so loud I couldn't hear anything on the DVD, waste of time much? Anyways this being my first time there I didn't know 1 ticket = 1 race for 1 person. So I go back to the front desk and explain to the lady the I purchased 2 races for 2 and she starts to tell me I'm confused and that's not the deal they have. Really? Maybe you should read the deal next time before just blowing it off and snapping the redeem button first. After going on groupon to find the deal again to show her she then decides to grill me on how much I paid, at this point I'm getting fed up, if she took the extra time to ACTUALLY read it we wouldn't be having this problem. This place could be fun but the employees make it unenjoyable. Cheap and cut corners for groupon purchases, so the rundown:
They try to get you to forfeit your races, you get no upgraded helmet just whatever is on the wall, you do get a head sock but  no sticker, they have race suits that look like they've never been washed no shoes, you get no autographed poster, and finally you get no bottled water unless you want to pay for it.

In the midst of my break (okay, lapse) from vegetarianism, I sought out this place for meaty delights.  When I want meat, I don't look for a steak--I want burgers and dogs, and Ted's did not disappoint.

With many dogs, the primary taste is from whatever condiments you put on the wiener.  With Ted's dogs, you get a smoky, slightly burnt taste of a REAL charcoal grilled frank that is enhanced by your custom toppings.

My tastes are simple and easy to please.  I like a foot long with just extra deli mustard--don't need more than that.  My wife likes more--mustard, ketchup, a little relish, and pickles.  Doesn't matter how you want it--Ted's will serve it up awesome.  Add fries and you've got a full meal for cheap.

For the record, I have to say that they day I had scheduled this nightmare appointment, I had complimented the GM, Scott, on how great their service had been in the sales department and with helping me set my first appointment for a FREE oil change.

I was very disappointed. After purchasing a car for myself, referring 3 people that have purchase cars there, and looking for a new car for both me and my girlfriend at that location, I can honestly say that I will never do business with this company again.  

Noel Estrada, the service writer I was assigned to when I set my appointment, was rude and did not seem to care about my wants or needs.  I was looking to pay to upgrade my oil to a duel blend because of the age of my engine.  I was told what would be put in would be the same as what was put in before I bought the car.  When i asked about my tires, I was told $70.   Mind you, I did not need more the a recharge on the Nitrogen and rotation.

When I told them about my interlock device, a device that I had told the person I set the appoint with was in the car, I was told first that they did not have enough staff on a Saturday to deal with having to disable the device.  (I would like to mention that the device is simply overridden with a phone call to Safe Harbor). When I mentioned to Noel that I had already cleared having the device with the appointment scheduler, I was told there would be $108 charge added because I had the device in my car

At this point I was at my limit.  I took my car back and went to another place which was closer to my home to begin with.  The gentleman at the counter there offered me a coupon price on the oil change I wanted (Only $36.63 after tax) without a prompt from me.  The wheels where done for free.  The car was completed in less then 3 hours even without an appointment, and I now have a new Service place.  

Pinnacle Nissan, thanks to Noel Estrada and his team of misfits, has lost my business and, worse then that, my referral business for life.  I say worse because I work in a business where hundreds of people a year ask for my advice on things such as where to buy a car.  My family and friends also know that I know where to get the best deal and service and frequently ask my opinion.

In this case, 1 bad apple did spoil the bunch for me.  I do not need to spend my money with a company that does not care about its customers.",2013-01-26 20:17:41

This place has been there for years, but I didn't notice it until the Food Network picked up a show called, Chuck's Day Off. This head chef is truly loving what he does. His tattoos reflect his love of fresh seafood, dessert and bacon!  So from the show and hearsay, I knew some of what I must order. But, the menu changes with the seasons, so you'll really have to show up to find out what is available.  There are around 7-8 ""Entree"" = appetizers in french and 7 plat principal = main courses to choose from.  Although he loves seafood, he keeps it very quebecois in creating a lobster poutine, or slow-food style short ribs.  My highlights were the Bloody Cesar with crab leg(s) and the fried Mars bar for dessert. Music gets progressively louder as the night goes on. Although this place is small, it has a very hip vibe. Friends keep coming and going through the night.  Best for small groups ( to share the seafood platter), and young couples.  Service was the downfall, as I had to keep looking around to order another drink and we waited 15 minutes to speak to the waiter after we were seated.

I have been here at least 5 times, and other than a couple minor disappointments that I will touch on in this review, I've had many good experiences. 

Pros:

Selection! A little big of everything. Want a salad, steak, fish, or potstickers? They have all of those.  

Service. Happy, perky people. Almost always. Appreciated. 

Price. Deals!! Daily specials. Alcohol & happy hours. YESSSSSS.

Game day. TV's for days!!!!!!!! As Allison S. would say, ""ALL THE GAMES!!""

Cons:

Salads. Haven't found one I enjoy, the freshness just is not there. 

Consistency. I hate when places run out of stuff, or say they have a daily soup, but that soup isn't there. 

Weak Drinks. Sangria pitcher for $10 sounds wonderful. No, super watered down. 

I can't really think of other cons. It is overall a really decent place to eat. I left quality out of either selection because you get what you pay for. The food is decent, not over the top amazing. But would you expect a $12 steak to be the best ever?

However, when I asked the server to point me toward menu items made with corn tortillas she immediately asked, do you not eat gluten? I was impressed.

How nice!

I figured the bar, which turns into a hopping nightlife destination on weekend nights, would be more notable for its drinks than its cuisine, and I was right.

Not that the place doesn't look hella cool. It had lots of hot pink accents, including pink lighting and pink walls, which I loved even though it sort of reminded me of the now-closed Pink Taco.

I also thought the art-covered skateboards covering up the walls were neat, as well as the giant drawings of a Mexican wrestler and a Dia de Los Muertos-like skull adorning one of the walls.

Don't go there just to dine, though. While there were lots of televisions broadcasting sports, and the margaritas were impressive, I was left wanting a lot more with the food. It was too bad the $8 house margarita, at a whopping 20 ounces, couldn't set the standard for the meal, since that drink was such as killer deal.

The chips and salsa weren't too bad. The chips were nothing to shout about, but I liked that they were served on a cute cutting board spread along with three different types of salsa-chunky and mild, green and a spicy red. I did like the salsas, although I would have preferred the chips were a little thinner. They were only $3, though, which was pretty cheap, although most places would serve them up for free.

My friend and I tried a couple of the Grilled Mushroom Calabacitas tacos ($3 each). They were filled with lots of veggies, including zucchini and onions, but they were bland and sort of awkward to pick up and hold because the tortillas were tiny compared to the filling. Add a ton of salsa to them to give them a little kick.

We also each had a cheese quesadilla ($7 each). The quesadilla was pitifully tiny, and it was served on wax paper, which caused all the melted cheese to get stuck. These were one of the biggest rip-offs I've had, and the presentation was very bare bones, despite the addition of unappetizing pickled baby carrots and a drizzling of goat cheese creme.

There were a couple other things to note about the visit-the napkins at El Hefe seemed to be coming apart and left white threads all over my friend's and my jeans-not cool if you're planning on going clubbing in Old Town later. The bartender checked his cell phone more than he checked on us-clearly, we weren't his first priority. And the menu was really difficult to read, with backwards letters and all-caps. I know that's a weird thing to notice, but just looking at it gave me a headache.

All that said, skip El Hefe for dinner, and head to the cute and trendy spot for happy hour every day from 3-7 p.m., when those giant margaritas are only $5. Enjoy the ambiance while you drink, and go to here, here, or here in Old Town for dinner instead.

Food was salty, not hot, not fresh nor was it very good or prepared well. I think about the only thing they did right was the congee I heard. The tea was even cold?

Thing that topped it off was we were served semi raw pan fried pork dumplings here (they were pink),  brought this the staff's attention and told them to remove from the bill. Of course when the bill arrived it was denial we brought it to their attention. And it was a game of he said and she said, you spoke to who, and they said they'll remove it from the bill.. etc

Folks, don't be confused like I was.  There it is, hiding in the sandwiches and not under the breakfast section of the menu.  Ashley showed me where it was and that's what I ordered.  Peanut butter is healthy, no?

Breakfast consisted of two slices of French toast with bananas, bacon, peanut butter, and Nutella inside--something from each of the five food groups so I deemed it healthy!

Before ordering, I was brought a very large cup of coffee.  You almost need to use both hands to pick it up and it was refilled quickly when I needed the push to be able to do stupid things faster.

My breakfast was brought and it was delicious!  I think Elvis would be pleased that he's being remembered with some good food like this.

All the staff at MTO was outstanding.  One of the bus persons asked me how my breakfast was as he removed my plate.  When I said, ""Excellent,"" he replied with a, ""That's what we like to hear,"" and a big smile.  I chatted with another staff member about restaurants in Los Angeles and he gave me a tip about a place to go in San Gabriel.  

I have to come back and get the pancakes with carrots and coconut.  It looks too good not to try!",2013-11-28 20:27:24

I finally had a chance to visit this space last night to see the comedy troupe ""Bully Mammoth"", we found parking fine (while seeing a lot of ladies with wigs walking around) and it was a pretty easy building to find since it is a big warehouse structure. I was surprised to find the inside was a little cramped(since the outside looked so spacious?). The hallway/entrance where the ticket sales were located was cramped and cash only (understandably) led into a long and not very wide seating area. There were couches up against the walls, the seating was only about 6 seats wide and there was a raised area in back to see the show better. We luckily attained front row seats of the slightly raised smaller stage, which had an all curtained background.

It was a great show (even though I got deer hide fur in my eye just when a hilarious skit came on, trapped in between laughing too hard to take the offending hair out of my eye causing me to cry as well-one hazard of sitting up close!), but it got pretty hot in there and with the actors under the hot lights sweating with all the body heat. 

When the show was over, there was a mad rush to the bathroom (only one, I found more toilet paper but not more paper towels, but fairly clean) and it was located in a room that had assorted furniture, futuristic paintings and an organ. (?). 

I am on their email list for writing workshops, plays and look forward to coming here for other events they put on, and def. to see Bully Mammoth again!",2009-11-22 18:02:17

I came to O&B Cafe Grill a couple of weeks ago with colleagues for lunch. I came in with an open mind - seeing as I'd never actually sampled their menu before. 

Unfortunately, upon arrival - they didn't have our table ready. So we ended up sitting around a couple of smaller tables nearby for about 5 minutes while they set us up. Not a great start to the meal.

The menu selection was decent - however nothing in particular stood out. I had narrowed my choices down to a small handful:
- Steak Frites
- Japanese Chicken Caesar Salad, and the
- Braised Beef Short Rib Gnocchi

Ultimately I went with the Steak Frites - being extremely hungry that day. Between my colleagues, they had gotten the Salad and the Gnocchi. Both looked like excellent choices - I wished I had gone with the Japanese Chicken Caesar Salad.

The steak was delicious - and grilled to a nice medium-rare. The fries were good too. I can't really find much else to say besides that haha.

I also ordered a cup of the O&B Mushroom Soup - made without cream or butter. It was really really good.

Unfortunately, with as much positive mentioned in the above post, I can't help but find the experience to be underwhelming overall. The menu items didn't stand out immensely and I would be hard to convince to come here under my own dime to have a meal. 

----------------------------------

As far as O&B goes for an after-work drinks occasion, I would put it at the middle of the pack for downtown Toronto (financial district) 

The patio is nice, and looks out onto the busy corner of Yonge/Front - however it is always ridiculously busy. When you do manage to get a table, the service is hard to get a hold of. I must suggest that they increase coverage and get more waiters/waitresses to cover the tables.",2013-11-25 02:26:07

We have lived in the area going on 10 years have gone to the Chilis numerous times. Although it has been sometime since our last visit since there are so many options around. But this will also be my last visit not just to this Chili's but to all Chili's! I will foreword if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to stop reading. So the wife and I decided to go out here for a late dinner. I ordered a beer and we ordered wings and the new fried pickles, for apps. We get them so far so good. Food was ok nothing special but we were having fun playing the little trivia deal they have on the tables now. I order ribs, wife a burger. I get another beer as the entrees are brought to the table. I'm eating the broccoli and a piece of rib. Now the wive likes to take ranch and put some ketchup in with it stir away for her fries. (Why I have no idea but I do see people do it a lot! Lol) well this is where we find what seems to be a chunk of chicken breast (which we had no chicken breast) in the ranch cup. Looks disgusting has it been chewed up and spit in there, taking from someone's plate that was suppose to be thrown away? Well at that point I have a stomach twisting and turning. Can feel it possible coming up. Waitress is going to get the manager. In the mean time I go outside I was not trying to make something dramatic out of it in the restaurant. So I get fresh air and go back in the manager is talking to my wife at first apologizes offers new food. Straight out I tell him I'm afraid I'm gonna get sick as my stomach is turning. He says ok let me take care of this I'll be back. As I'm talking to the wife she informs me that it was the original dipping sauce that we were both using for our apps. At that point I'm done I run out of the restaurant heaving. Make it to a bush and start throwing up the food. Now I'm embarrassed as patrons are walking in and out watching me. Anyways I wait for the wife she comes out and the manager made her pay for the apps and beer! The same apps and beer that I left in there parking lot and not in a forgetful way. I had all intentions of going back in a couple weeks because I know stuff does happen. But after this and the way the manager handled the situation I will never walk into a Chilis again and it's sad because I've always liked there ribs. When my wife didn't get a receipt I told her we need to go back I wanted his name and my rec. at first he says I charge you for what you ate. I said ok the food I just throw up outside? You guys just ruined our whole dinner and I get charged for it? He was trying to defend his actions at that point all I wanted was a receipt, name, and corporate number. Then he wanted to give me my money back. I told him you just don't get it we were here to spend a lot more then that you ever dentally need the money more then I do. The last part of the conversation I was definitely heated and some f bombs and yelling started due to the manager just not getting me the info I wanted. To top it off this was suppose to be my birthday dinner with just the wife and I well the kids where with family. Thanks Chilis for ruining dinner and my birthday with the wife. Just wanted some ribs and a few cold beers!

I've been to Chinatown and visited other authentic places, but nothing compares to Jun's in my book.  Today, I came to Jun's to pick up some grub on the way home.  Here's what I got today and what I usually get when I visit:

BBQ Chicken and Kalbi combo, with a drink for $12.65- The chicken is boneless thigh meat, my fav, prefectly marinated and grilled.  The Kalbi is also perfectly marinated.  I  got about three healthy pieces of chicken and one piece of Kalbi.  Although they have many sides to choose from, I usually get the shoyu potatoes which are super flavorful and has a pleasant sweetness to it, as well as the bean sprouts, primarily because it offers a wonderful texture which I enjoy.  Great for takeout or dine in.

Stone Pot Bi Bim Bop (Dol Sot-please don't kill me if I misspelled it) for $9.95- Now this dish can only be enjoyed through dine in because of the stone pot it comes in.  There's a ton of shredded veggies, beef, egg and rice.  When it comes to the table, I wait for five minutes as the sizzling pot crisps up the rice, then I got to town!  I start by mixing everything together, crack the yolk and let the egg cook more on the pot.  I finish the mixed bowl with sriracha and soy sauce.  I can't get enough of this and will keep coming back just because of this dish alone!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

The place is super small.  I find myself playing a guessing game whether or not we'll have a table open for us when we visit.  I think because of the location, it's super convenient for me and the wait time isn't very long.  

Being from Hawaii, I feel this place really attracts a lot Hawaiian transplants.  They sell Hawaiian Sun drinks and above all, there's a lot of the Aloha spirit.  Trust me when I say, it's definitely worth going back!",2012-03-27 05:09:18

A bit overpriced in some areas, and no AYCE options, but I have never had a bad roll or bad sashimi here. I used to frequent another Henderson sushi restaurant until their quality went downhill (significantly) and my husband introduced me to MoMo. The Irish roll and Something Wrong are some of my favorites, and if you like crispy (fried) sushi, Tara's Fatty is one for you (read: cream cheese and shrimp). The volcano is also very good if you want more crab and less cream cheese. 

The wait staff can be spotty at times, but never rude. I have only had one issue with a waitress who made my young son cry, but I have not seen her in there in a while. Anyway, if you go on a busy day (Fridays at dinner and Lunch on the weekdays seem to take the cake) then you might get less than stellar wait service if they are understaffed.

The actual bao buns are large, but the meat fillings are sparse. My pork belly bao had one slice of pork belly inside the large palm-sized bao, whereas most bao places would supply you with two.  The bulgogi beef bao had roughly a tablespoon of beef in it. 

I could forgive this meaty frugality, but on top of this it was altogether just super bland.  If there was any sauce in there, it must've been a minuscule amount because it was like eating raw, dry vegetables in an equally dry, plain piece of bread.  

The taro fries, while they tasted OK, were mostly small leftover crumbs like they were scraped out from the bottom of the fryer (like little taro Tic-Tacs!).  $5 is a hefty price to pay for this.

Ditto for the price of a bottle of water - regular cans of pop are sold at ~$1.50 and Jarritos and other bottled soda goes at $2.50. A bottle of water (not Fiji or anything expensive) also goes at $2.50.  Yikes.

Only complaint, which is probably my bad, is that it was sort of expensive for what we got. Granted, we ordered *small* plates, but they indeed are small. I think it would've been smarter for us to get one small plate and share two entrees, instead of getting like 6 small plates.

Mostly because I look at everything on the menu and think, ""I could make that"" or ""It won't be as good as Grandma's"" or ""It won't be as good as in Italy."" But everyone told me I would love Dish, so I came here with my parents for my birthday. We all agreed that it was outstanding, and I have since been back for a couple of special occassions. It's easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

The pasta is always cooked perfectly al dente. My favorite is their homemade gnocchi. They do a mean bolognese sauce, and anything with seafood is always super, super fresh.

What I really love about Dish has to be the antipasto, though. The carpaccio is done in a very traditional style with arugula and parmigiano reggiano, and I'm also a fan of all of their salads. My favorite was a fennel, beet, and blood orange combination. And, I'm saving the best for last...the grilled eggplant with mozzarella di bufala is an absolute MUST. Orgasmic. The first time we came here, we loved it so much, we ordered a second plate of it. They use a 15-year-old balsamic vinegar on it that's perfectly sweet and sticky and of course the mozzarella is super creamy and oozing with milk. Sorry, I'm drooling all over my keyboard right now...I would be happy eating this every day of my life.

Excellent desserts and drinks, too, and perfect service. All around, a great, authentic Italian restaurant. The only thing it's missing is...dare I say it...pizza. We need more places that make authentic pizza here, and I bet Dish could show Pittsburgh what's up.",2011-06-21 04:07:15

They use the foil bowl containers, and somehow the bottom of it had a tear in it. they put the container in a white paper bag, which I placed on the floor of my car as I was rushing to work. I arrived at work and went to get my chicken angelo out of the car, only to notice that the oily liquid contents of the foil bowl leaked through the paper bag and all over the ivory interior of my brand new car :( I had called Chicago Joe's and asked to speak to a manager (not to get anything for free, but just to let them know maybe they should consider using plastic bags instead of paper. I was informed by the person on the phone that they did not employ any managers. I proceeded to tell the gentleman on the phone what had happened, to which his response was ""oh, thats not good"" no ""I'm sorry"" and didn't even ask for my name.....I literally had to say ""would you like my name?"" and he said ""if you want to give it to me""

The place always clean and they have a manager that is always making the rounds.  So that is a plus.

Their staff, at least up front, tend to get in little cliques like a bunch if giggling high-school kids and give off the vibe that you are really ruining their evening by having them work for their pay.

The parking is a bit challenging, and you may lose cell signal while in the under ground parking area (just don't use your phone while parking, you need the extra concentration anyway).  The cigar shop in the parking deck area absolutely STINKS and if you are even near it, you should shut off the air conditioning in your car unless you want it to smell like an ash tray.  That is one store that just needs to be GONE!  Once you are in the mall, there is a very nice layout that keeps traffic moving with very wide wings for walking.  On some weekends, the local animal shelters will have dogs for adoption here and it is the most adorable thing ever.  I want to take all of them home, but I then realize I live in a condo not a farm.  Alas, I digress. They do a great job with vendor selection in the walkways of the mall. They aren't overly harassing and some can be quite friendly at times.  It's best that you dress very dapper here, between the Apple Store trendsetters rummaging the mall and the 16-30 year olds who are trying to find their next date at the mall, you will need to bring your A game if you want people to notice you.  The vibe is definitely a younger one. They have good seating areas, but the fabric on most of the small couch-like pieces of furniture look like they have been lived on since the mall's opening. They have strategically placed AEDs for those who may have a heart attack from shopping.  The secret entrances all over the mall make for a great ""bat cave"" experience should you decide to try some of them. My favorite is the one near Pottery Barn.

We tried a Lime Wit, which was citrus with coriander - we liked but didn't love it. Then we switched to Pale Ale which was 'more better' and quite nice.

I found this store overall to be overpriced very large somewhat unorganized and I was very disappointed when I was charged five cents per plastic bag at cash. The other negative at the cash was that there were only two cash registers open and 2 express cash registers which all  had long lineups. They (should have Opened more ) cash registers. I simply came to the store to see what the fuss is about why the parking lots are always full and why most of the people in the area prefer the store.

I came knowing I was going to order a pate sandwich, but didn't see it on the menu. Upon asking, they told me they could make me a pate sandwich and asked if I wanted it with or without butter. I opted for no butter, letting the pate do it's own rich thing.

The sandwich was huge and only $2! Not sure if this is regular pricing or grand opening pricing seeing as all the other banh mi are $3.45- which, on it's own, is pretty competitive for Vegas.
The bread is crusty and crisp on the outside while light and buttery on the inside- perfect! Way better than Mr. Sandwich and on par with Dakao. The vegetables were just right and cut the richness from the smear of chicken pate which was actually minimally applied. The cilantro provided that herbal kick that I love so dearly. Jalapeños for heat. Sriracha because.. Well.. It's Sriracha, and every table is equipped with it. Based on the bread and veggies alone, this is a major banh mi contender on the LV China Town strip.

They offer a lot of soups and deli items as well, though the sandwich was just right for me and I was unable to bring myself to sample anything else.

And nice plus was the hot jasmine tea they brought me when I sat down, brewed just right and not bitter. 

Update!: after speaking with the owner, he also owns Dakao up the road, but he says he likes the bread better here because they have a different oven. =)",2013-12-06 01:03:40

It's not an authentic ""Quebec"" poutine but it's delicious enough. they are definitely large sizes and the Groupon allowed me to get two large sizes of different flavours. Got a cheese burger and got a pizza.

both were made with generous amounts of cheese and gravy with lots of topping that was overflowing. they put them in a large old fashioned grocery bag Because there is so much they give you! put a seat belt on it and turn the seat warmer up if you're getting take out like I did.

a few recommendations I wish they had Sweet Potato and other starches like Yucca, Taro, and skinny or fat fries too. that would really put it over the top. that's probably a franchise decision though.

It was a great moment to be there and see all the love offerings such as, roses, candles, and art works on the ground,, the word ""IMAGINE"" was still on the mosaic...


So, four of us watched the Beatle Show @5:30 on one Sunday evening. I had no idea About the show and I didn't want to read the reviews before watching.  I like surprises and I was sure that I would like the show no matter what.. The universal appeal of the Beatles all ages and races love them anyways :-). 
The performers on the stage were all fantastic!  All I can say is that they're so talented.  All the way to the end of the show, they were singing live one song after another, amazing!!
If you truly love the Beatles' music, it is a great show to watch.  During the show, you will get to sing along and dance to your favorite songs.
I still remember the scene of John Lennon was playing a white grand piano and singing ""Imagine"" wearing a white tux.   I don't know why but I almost burst in tears.
The costume and the lighting effect were great also.  
You will get a chance to order your drink while watching the show but there is a bar at the Saxe Theater before you entering the show.   If you get there a little early enough, you can take some time to grab a favorite drink of yours.

It was a deal I couldn't pass up...so I also bought my best friend one and we immediately made our appointments.  That was over 2 years ago and I am still a fan!

Our first appointments were with two awesome facialists, Julie and Ali.  They both love their job, which makes them very good at what they do. They are professional and friendly. If you want to talk during your facial, they have plenty to talk about, but if you want to just sit back and relax, they are good at making you feel like you are transported into your own little peaceful oasis. Ali has since left...but Julie is still there. I recommend her to anyone and everyone!

Prior to facials and massages, you get to go to the back room and wait for your appointment.  It is peaceful with two couches and plenty of snacks to munch on.

I have also had several manicures, pedicures and massages there. I have had a different person every time for each service, so can't really recommend any specific person.  I also feel that my experience with these services have been both good and okay (reason for only 4 stars).

If their prices seem a little steep, then make sure you get on their mailing list. Every now and then they have specials such as buy one service get second for $10. Also keep an eye out on Groupon and Travel Zoo (I have found great deals there as well).

One of the things I love about this place is that they do NOT try to sell you theirs or any products.  I have been to salons where they are all about sell, sell, sell!

I believe the restaurant got the name ""Red Lobster"" as that is the color of the lobster's shell once boiled and completely cooked. But they definitely Orange or Brown when they are alive tho.

They usually offer free biscuits. They are very yummy when they are fresh and warm but lose all taste when cold. Like Kanye would say:

Guests next to us had to ask three times for a spoon as well.

There are a TON of items with 'pork green chili'.  As lovers of pork green chili...we had to try it.  We also love good biscuits n gravy...so tried those too.  

We had to continually ask for coffee - which was the WORST coffee ever but we were tired and needed the caffeine!  

The coffee tasted bad and it also tasted as though they never clean the equipment....nasty. 

Our breakfast arrived, still no spoons....

The food was - blah.  

The steak was decent but over cooked (the server and I even discussed 'medium rare' and the definition so I know she understood my order).  Everything was 'cool' not hot.  The potatoes weren't freshly removed from the skillet / cook top; the eggs had obviously been sitting for a while...

And the biscuits n gravy.  BOO.  Biscuit was rock hard - no flavor.  The gravy came from a can.  YUK.

The Pork Green Chili was from a can as well....two pieces of 'pork' were located ...thats all.  

Even on the Wet Burrito....with what should have been hot, pork green chili....the pre-packaged, shredded cheese wasn't even melted.  

Fast forward to - sprinkling salt & pepper on everything (cuz it was so boring).  The pepper top pops off and a bottle of pepper lands on my eggs n steak.  BOO. 

Server comes by and sees:

Two napkins covered in pepper, my black eggs & pepper shaker and top and pepper everywhere.

Her response was good:  she offered to get two new eggs....but walked off without TOUCHING the mess on the table!  Just left it there....unbelievable.

It took us 20 minutes to get our check/pay the tab and get our card back.  They were semi busy but had plenty of staff.

While we were sitting, another server came by.  He had jeans with HUGE holes in the front and back...his undershorts were showing in the front; he had a dirty hand towel tucked in his front belt and overall looked like he belonged in the back cooking or something.  Not appropriate for serving.

Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'.

One of the worse cuts I ever had. Choppy and uneven, she was just grabbing random strands and cutting it. She cuts it after it's been washed, then she'll dry it, and more cutting happens. So, a trim is no longer a trim anymore. Now, I have annoying side bangs that fall in front of my face and a puffy top layer - not what I needed. 

I asked for light curls for my style in the end. She used a brush and blowdryer. Unfortunately, thick Asian hair is stubborn and will not just curl like that. So, end product, a hot mess. She then tells me that ""My next client is here, so if you want different curls, I'll get an assistant to do it"". 

Also, it was a pretty awkward hour. Jen does not hold conversations nor smile, giving you the cold vibe. Definitely not what I want in a hair dresser. 

Got Rebecca (sp?) to fix my hair and she was super sweet! And tried her best to fix what I wanted! 

Right when I was about to write my review, I got an e-mail from Parlour apologizing for my dissatisfaction. It was really nice to see them redeeming Parlour and having great customer service. I'm happy to say that they have recommended me another hair stylist and I will be returning back to Parlour soon, once my hair grows back out. (An extra star for customer care!)

Well, this time I came by myself to grab her some food while she studied (I know, I know, I'm such a good friend).

Weekends are busy busy. I dropped by early Saturday afternoon and there was a massive line for takeout. No worries though, it moves pretty fast.

The menu is pretty straightforward with hot and cold drinks, breakfast and lunch options. Sandwiches and soups seem to be their jam. They also have massive baked goodies that tempt you while you wait in line.

Couple specials on their side menu, just above the kitchen counter. Nothing too mind blowing/dramatic here.

You get to customize your sandwich to your hearts content. I like how they have special breads for every day of the week (Monday: Sundried tomato, Tuesday: Wheat and honey, Wednesday: Cranberry rosemary, Thursday: Cheese and chive, Friday: Dill, Saturday: Asiago Italian herb, and Sunday: Rosemary garlic). Makes them stand out from the crowd a bit.

Takeout bag. FYI - not the best bag to carry when you're biking back home. At least it lasted with only a few small tears.

Whole sandwich with soup ($14.10) and puffed wheat squares ($4.10) - got the Saturday Asiago Italian herb bread and tomato bacon soup special. Didn't try the sandwich and soup but my friend liked it. Good amount of turkey meat and vegetables. I had the puffed wheat square which was pretty addictive. Fell apart easily and not overly sweet.

I went here on 11/14/10 with James L. for breakfast before we headed off to church - to end our two day date. I had raved and raved about how much I loved this restaurant so he took me to eat here. Big mistake.

Anyway, we both got the AYCE breakfast, and he also got, if I remember correctly, orange juice  - I started with the steak and eggs and he got... I forgot. For his second dish, he ordered the peanut butter and banana wrap and hated it. He said it tasted like just peanut butter.  I spent most of the time trying to flag down our very inattentive waiter (guy with glasses serving the tables closest to the bar and musicians at about 10:20 AM) so I could get something else to eat once my plate had been cleared by another waiter. I tried the cheese blintz  for my second dish and they were quite yummy. My third dish I ordered the lox hold the bagel. The lox was CRISPY on the edges, as if it had been sitting out for a long time, they included no cream cheese or capers either this time. I couldn't finish it.

So the voucher said this on it (I still have the electronic copy so this is verbatim):
- Limit 1 voucher per visit
- Valid only at the location selected (Yorkdale Mall: 3401 Dufferin Street)
- Not valid with other promotions
- Must print voucher and present at time of visit. Electronic vouchers are not accepted
- Does not include tax or gratuity. No cash value. No cash back

I always read the fine print and nowhere did it say that you must order from the dinner menu and that you cannot order from the lunch menu.

So I was there at lunch time with my parents.  So I ordered from the lunch menu.  We ordered an order of Butter Chicken, an order of Masala Lime Lamb, and an order of Amaya Prawns.  When I went to pay (we were doing takeout so it was shortly after ordering), the cashier charged me the dinner prices which were $4 more for each plate than the lunch prices.  I asked her why and she said it was because I was using the Wagjag voucher.  There was a huge lineup behind me (I have no idea why this place was so busy) and we were so hungry, I didn't care to argue with her, so I just paid it and took our orders out to the food court.  WTF?  I'm charged the dinner prices at lunchtime because I'm using a voucher?  And I'm pretty sure I wasn't given dinner-sized portions because the portions were pretty dinky.  So I had to pay over $20 on top of the $20 voucher (the total food bill was over $40 - for 3 dinky portions and no beverages).     

So maybe the food is actually good...wrong!  It's not good at all.  The shrimp (prawns) tasted disgusting to me.  They were mushy.  How in the world do you make shrimps mushy?  I have no idea.  They definitely did not taste fresh.  My parents were not crazy about the butter chicken or masala lamb either.  What a waste of money and calories.

We853schI2SMtGPJHYHYtA,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,Egn5h9fStvVKcFH7kaLQig,3,2,1,1,"3030 has young-professional written all over it. Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.

3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).

One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.

Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.

But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.

Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.

If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.

With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.",2013-04-27 11:21:30

The ""naan"" flat bread is piping hot when it comes to your table.  The garlic naan is my favorite.  And the curries are always wonderful.  

If you haven't tried Indian food, take your time getting used to the menu.   Generally the main dishes are chicken, lamb or vegetables, in a different kind of curry sauce.  If you go on a date you can order two or three plates and share.  The items toward the top of each list are simpler and less spicy.  The further down the menu you go, the more interesting and spicy the dishes get.  I recommend starting with ""medium"" and seeing if that's too hot or if you'd actually like spicier.   If you ask for ""between mild and medium"" they can do that too.  I like to pick one meat dish and one vegetable dish, usually something with potatoes.  Dinner comes with basmati rice (long grain rice with a little saffron).

Super friendly service although not American style waitering.  There is generally a head waiter who is also the host.  They will seat you and take your order.  After that, other waiters will serve you in turn, one getting drinks and another serving food.  It can be a bit slow at times, so don't go if you're in a rush.  Give yourself at least an hour or two.  Even if you decide curry's not for you, it's an amazing experience of completely different flavors. When in doubt, order a chicken dish.",2008-03-23 01:15:04

Most other reviews raved about the pumpkin curry, so I was excited to try it. While it had good flavor, it was exactly my favorite. For being a curry, it was very sweet - and I can see why people liked it. But personally, I like my curries more savory and spicy. 

The duck spicy basil noodles were delicious though ! They didn't ask how spicy we wanted it... so it ended up pretty spicy and i would've preferred it to be a little less, but other than that ... it was great. They didn't skimp out on the duck either which was good. 

The fried tofu wasn't anything spectacular. It was good, but was just something you could get at any restaurant.

It helps that our Turkish friends that we frequent Istanbul Sofra with also vouch for the food and have always been there to help explain the menu.

We've been going since just after Instanbul Sofra replaced the less-than-impressive Alma, so we've seen the owner's commitment to improvement in the changes to both the atmosphere and the menu over the last year or so. I've seen my favorite dish (Iskender) refined and my favorite dessert (kanafeh) added to the menu. 

You can't beat the service that the staff provides for the most part. The owner is always making sure your table is treated well, and that you're happy with your meal. If there's something that you didn't enjoy, don't hesitate to tell him. I've never been somewhere that's so open to thoughts and willing to accept criticism and show such gratefulness when complimented.

The attentiveness and feeling of appreciation from the staff would keep us coming back even if the food wasn't excellent, but fortunately, we don't have to worry about that! The food is delicious!

Speaking of quirky the look and feel of this place is kind of weird it looks like the space had been rented to a wanna be brew pub that failed and as soon as it closed this family moved in and  started making dumplings. It's an odd looking place.

I learned from some of their classes, and they were great. I love their 40% off weekly coupons - they are really what keeps me going back. There are a couple of really nice sales people, but there are quite a few REALLY bad sales people. I think others (based on reviews) have noticed this as well. I think Bead World could go from 2 stars to 5 if they invested in some customer service training. Some of the employees are really rude, almost annoyed by customers. It's like the company culture is that customers are just there to annoy them. So many times I have heard an employee say ""I really don't know"" or ""I have no idea if we'll get that back in again"" etc. It isn't just me, I see them be rude to other customers, like they can't wait to say no or be unhelpful, to assert their power or something. I notice this especially when people call. I've been in the store and witnessed really rude phone conversations and have called a couple times and had bad experiences. For example, I just called to check on the stock of an item, and she said ""I think we have that"" and I asked her to check so I didn't have to drive all the way over if they didn't, so she went to check, came back said ""yes we do"" and then hung up without saying goodbye or thank you before I finished thanking her for checking. 

I love to support local and small businesses. I worked at one as a teen. I know that customers can be difficult sometime, but it isn't that hard to be nice, especially to customers who are being really nice to you. As I mentioned, some of the sales people are really nice.

1. No lock on the bathroom door
2. Only 1 toilet
3. No door on the stall

To the left was the sink and paper towels.  The only thing separating the toilet from the sink was a measly shower curtain hung by zip ties!! I mean really...zip ties. They couldn't even buy real shower curtain rings. When i tried to slide the curtain shut i had to move it inch by inch because it was too tightly hung. 

Seeing that there is only one toilet and the few people who saw me go inside the stall, i figured i would have my privacy but of course that didn't happen. 30 seconds into my curtain pulling. Two drunk women stumble in loud and laughing meanwhile leaving the door to the girls room open. Did i mention the bathroom is right next to the bar!! So i had to announce to them i was using the toilet, God forbid they open the curtain!!. They were laughing and taking pictures while i'm praying that they leave soon or just don't pull the curtain back.

I've used and been loyal consumer of every Dr. Scholl's foot product he ever invented that he would probably be upset if he ever finds out I'm putting my feet on someone else hands. but I came to the point that I have to add two more hands on the care of my always tired feet.
 I went to the good foot spa looking for Joyce, recommended by a yelper friend, but she doesn't work there any longer so I asked for the second best. Kathy did a wonderful job, I can't say she's the best since this is my first foot massage but anything better than this would have probably been illegal. They have a 30 minute special but I opted for the 45 minute service which at the end given the prep and this and that you really get about 35 minutes of actual massage and even though I was there for the foot massage she started from the top of my head all the way down to my arms and legs covering about 99 percent of my body, (missing under the chin if you really have to know) while my feet soaked.
 It was early in the morning when I went there, I think it was just me and one other person in a different room being slapped around or at least that's what I made out from the sounds and the moans that I could hear clearly since there was no mood music. I didn't want my mind to go wild so I put on my I pod and listened to my own music, Maria Callas to be exact, her screaming was way more relaxing than the guy's next door.
Yes, there's a little of that language barrier, but at the end, the massage language is universal, besides I grew up at the barrio and being an expert on sign language came pretty handy for me. I really had a very relaxing experience, my feet felt like new and so did everything else she put her hands on.  I was really surprised how great it feels after after a good foot massage.

Random Notes: 
1. Pork soup dumplings - pretty damned good but it's no 'Joe's Shanghai' in NY. Only six (smaller) dumplings to an order (most places have eight) and more than $1 per. Quality was quite good, but not as soupy as I like. Still, very good. 
2. Kung Pao chicken did not illicit a reaction nearly as memorable as George's from Seinfeld, but was a tasty dish nonetheless. I suspect the peppers were either flash deep fried or cooked in a lot of oil. 
3. They actually serve the dan-dan noodle. They tasted like they could be house made. That being said, they're not very flavorful. This dish is forgettable but not regrettable. 
4. Thursday at 9:30pm = empty.

The staff, nurses, and doctors at SW Medical were just absolutely awesome.  As part of our OB, we met with 3 doctors (Skinner, Kashap, and Schwartz).  All were amazing, friendly, and informative.  

When we were told that my wife had to have a ""C-section"", we chose doctor Paula Schwartz to perform the surgery.  This review is based on her work with us.

Two words - ""Absolutely AMAZING!!""  Dr. Schwartz is so down to earth, easy going, informative, and just great to work with.  She made us comfortable, provided us with the information we needed, and kept us in the loop.  

As for the surgery, she did an amazing job with the surgery.  My wife's ""cut"" was excellent and she healed perfectly.  I can not thank DOCTOR Schwartz enough.  If we could, we would definitely hug her.  Well deserved!!

As for the OB office, very clean, very courteous, and very professional.  We rarely waited more than 15 minutes.  Once we were in, the nurses were attentive, friendly, and helpful.

The only negative that I would say is that it was difficult to make appointments.  I guess they outsourced this and it is hard to get an exact date and time.

Pros  - Hmm...well my meal was serviceable.  Nothing to rave about.  But it was tasty.  I got the chicken tikka.  As did one of my dinning companions.  Our other girlfriend got the lamb.  Her review was similar.  Not bad, but not raving from the rooftops at how good it was.  I also give them props for automatically splitting the apps.  That's nice,  can you tell I'm digging for positives.  


The Cons -  There's more of them and they are more concrete.
1.  The service.  The hostess was very little help when I came in asking for my party.  She seemed clueless.  Now in fairness I guess she didn't seat them, but you'd think she'd know who was where based on the fact that it wasn't busy and it's not a huge place.  Our waiter - he was meh, and very slow.  I honestly can't tell you if they offer free refills as I was never offered a top off or refill of my diet coke!  It took forever to take our orders.  Also he was very little help when asked about the menu.  I'm sure he was knowledgeable,  but he didn't appear to give a eff quite honestly. 
2.  The portion size.  For the price I expect a lot more.  For a table of three we were given one plate of rice to share.  Now all of our meals were swimming in broth.  Oh hell no, you need to keep that slightly crisp (was is supposed to be that way?) rice coming.  
3.  One dining mate got a side of vegetables  -  which turns out was $7 bucks.  I repeat $7 bucks.
4.  Yes Charlotte is in the midst of a record heat wave, but no excuse for being so damn hot.  Copper turn the A/C on high!

Overall I won't be back and I don't get why people rave about this place.  I think there's better Indian that doesn't stink of 'try too hard' in Charlotte.",2015-06-18 01:07:27

A couple of the restaurants we've tried there are exceptional, however most of the eateries, although good, are of the fast food or gastropub variety you typically find at a mall. Most of the time we're in the mood for something a little healthier, especially when it comes to dessert, so we appreciate having this restaurant available.

My girlfriend and I shared a Mango Acai Bowl with Whey Protein added, the portion size of which was plenty for the two of us.

The Acai bowls consist primarily of a fruit sorbet with various toppings. The mango bowl was topped with coconut flakes, granola, and sliced banana.

All of the ingredients tasted nutritious and delicious, the sorbet was smooth, refreshing, and not too sweet, and the fruit was fresh. The quality of the toppings was very good and they complimented the sorbet nicely. The flavor of the mango did not come through as much as I would have liked as a result of the berries that were also blended into the sorbet, but that didn't detract in any way from the overall flavor.

The service was prompt and courteous and the prices are reasonable for a mall restaurant. We both agreed that it's nice to have a healthy alternative for a snack when we're out at the Tempe Marketplace and I expect we'll be stopping here regularly.

Actually they were but things change and sometimes the stakes go up and you just need more from a company. That's where 24-7 comes in. We got into triple digit temps in June. Our upstairs AC unit went out. I had called our previous Ac company and they were able to send someone in 4 days! So for four days we suffered without Ac upstairs. But I was loyal so we stuck it out. Guy comes out and does some tests and determines the breaker for that ac unit was dead. He tells me I need to call an electrician. So I found one electrician but he's booked up and recommends 24/7. Keep in mind I had no idea that they also are ac techs. So I make an appointment with them and they are able to come out in a couple days. I was at work when he came over but the cool thing is because he is an ac tech and an electrician he got it all done in one shot. He replaced the breaker and then topped off our freon. If he was only an electrician we would've had to make another appointment and play the waiting game while we die in triple digit temps.

First off, the parking is atrocious. Get here like an hour early if you want to avoid the rip-your-hair-out-run-people-over-cuss-a-lot frustration that comes with the freakishly long line of cars that starts a mile before you even get to Ak-Chin. There's got to be a better system for this.

Second...we saw a girl squat down and pee (yes, really) just outside of the pavilion. I don't think we are in Kansas anymore folks...it was disgusting to say the very least...not sure why no one stopped her.

The show itself was great and the weather cooperated fairly well...the seats a re a little close together, which can make for an awkward nice-to-meet-you-sorry-I-brushed-your-arm for the 25th time moment.

The food is a rip off, much like any concert venue. $4.50 for a bottle of water, $9+ for anything alcoholic and at least $8-12 for any type of snack.

After 66 years, this longtime downtown eatery is closing its doors, so we decided to stop in for one final meal. We got there a little before 1 on Tuesday, and the waiter told us we would be the last customers of the day because they ran out of food! Good news for us, but bad news for the dozen or so customers who came in after us. One of those groups instead asked for a carry-out order of chips and salsa, and the waiter scrambled to comply; these were obviously longtime customers, and they said they'd be back later in the week for a complete meal.

Most times I've eaten here, I've had the taco and chile relleno combo plate, so I decided to stick with tradition. The relleno was as good as I remembered it, and the taco was even better. My husband had a beef taco and a chicken burrito; both were equally good.

Service was good with quick refills, which was appreciated because it would be easy to slack off when you have only days left on the job. It seemed like everyone in the restaurant was a longtime customer, and while there was an air of sadness due to the imminent closure, it was clear everyone was enjoying their ""last meal.""

Religiously, I will start my dinner with an order of beef samosas. They arrive at your table piping hot served along side some stellar tamarind chutney. The beef filling is bountiful and seasoned well; these will forever be a staple of mine. From the tandoor I would typically select the chicken tikka, seekh kebabs or paneer tikka. For mains the butter chicken here will make the cut every time. The blend of masala and spices is near perfect and the boneless chicken pieces are tender and definitely pre-marinated. I've eaten butter chicken everywhere, and BC's BC holds its own.  

It is important to note that if I were vegetarian I would be most pleased with this restaurant. I find most veggie heads love paneer, as do I. Bombay's Chutney boasts 5 vegetarian curries which showcase paneer: Chili paneer, paneer makhni (butter sauce), saag paneer (spinach), karahi paneer and mattar paneer (peas). In addition to the plethora of paneer dishes they have several other vegetarian ones including my absolute favourite, Malai Kofta. 

To accompany the dishes you can order biryani or naan. Unfortunately I have never tried the biryani because their garlic naan has always been way too spot on to deviate away from. The naan is brought to your table straight from the tandoor and is always perfectly cooked. If you order the garlic rendition it will be brushed with butter then absolutely riddled with garlic bits before going into the tandoor. The garlic bits caramelize and crisp up and my goodness it's perfect.  

Overall a solid experience each and every time I visit this venue. The only quam I have with BC is that they now have a huge sign at the front of the establishment advertising a $4.99 lunch, I feel that this takes away from the class of the restaurant a bit, but you gotta do what you gotta do. 

Service is always awesome and they have a bar complete with various wines, liquors and beers including Kingfisher! Nice.",2009-12-01 17:10:30
XoyaadpRakcYO4yvYRLIKg,eNF1jV-XH4-IvyrYsL4VwQ,mspZuHQ8rVXpyVMqQIKw_A,3,2,0,0,"Fusion pasta in J-town with pasta sets and cake from the bakery next door.

Decent price and unique Japanese fusion flavours not found anywhere else.

All pastas come with a house salad. The size of the house salad has decreased significantly in quantity then when the restaurant first opened. Probably no more than 2 bites.

Soup is always a sure bet. Served warm in a mug with croutons. Can range from clam chower, bacon potato soup to tomato bisque. Always something to look forward to.

The pasta dishes haven't changed much over the years. I prefer the shrimp okonomiyaki, shrimp cream of corn, fettucine rose, and the unagi don. The shimeji shoyu and sukiyaki beef comes in a more liquidy broth than usual. The pasta is always al dente with a good ratio of sauce to meat.

Have Japanese inspired fries - nori fries, Japanese poutine, and okonomiyaki flavour. The portions are great to share, but with the pasta itself and the slice of toast, might be too much for the general appetite.

You can add soup to your pasta or a pasta set, which includes soup and cake.

We sat at the table by the window.

Gord ordered Fish Cakes and Eggs, with a side of bacon.  I ordered the P.L.T., minus the lettuce.

We both noticed that the potatoes were really really salty and way overloaded with herbs.  Gord tried to scrape off the peeling and eat the inside.  I tried dunking them in ketchup.  We both ended up leaving most of them.

Gord said his fish cakes were okay and found the bacon too salty.  He said the best part were the eggs and toast.

My sandwich was just okay.  I couldn't taste any mustard or garlic mayo.  The bottom bun was really really soggy so I ended up just eating the peameal bacon.

Or at least the same way of preparing food (usually with ketchup in the Pad Thai, sadly).

And for some reason, the Red Room is the worst of the four. I've had good and bad experiences there, but mostly bad. I heard through the grapevine that the wait staff are told upon being hired that they're allowed to be as rude as they want to customers because the food is cheap. So, naturally, they are very rude. Not cool.

But if I were in court, that would be hearsay, so here's my real evidence: once, at Red Room, my friend found a ladybug in her sandwich. Ew.

Not to mention the place is usually filled with frat boy douche bags and GTA-ers on their way to see ""a friend's band play Battle of the Bands at the El Mo!! Sweet!""

5GJ8NsO92xniZDhQkooALA,CUpCNJmVvYCekxvpKDhEjQ,InV8Flk6LhCyDqDNVEkLrg,4,3,0,0,"This place, for me, surpassed My Sister's Closet as one of my favorite consignment shops a long time ago. However, my view of them recently, has been becoming less favorable. They have gained a huge following on Instagram, posting their latest wares along with prices. They also do what they call ""teasers"" after they close where they post, for e.g., a purse that came in that day...I guess it generates buzz for them that carries into the next day. So here is one of my anecdotal negative experiences that happened, literally, moments ago: I see a cute purse last night posted as a teaser. It's something I've been looking for, so I know I want to buy it.  I call, but they are closed. There is no recording to advise you if they will be open the next day (today--which is Labor Day), so I get up this and head over anyway. I actually get there at 8:45.  They aren't open, so I wait.  I see the store employee walk up at 8:58am, so I give her a minute to collect herself for opening and wait for her to flip the ""closed"" sign to ""open"".  I walk in, literally, as she's doing this and ending a call. I walk over to the purse, ready to purchase, and she informs me it *just now* sold. She then takes another call. Obviously disappointed, I leave. 

Here is the problem: this place has become enormously popular. I really do want them to be successful, so good for them! But since they give priority to whoever can get their *ear* first, WORD TO THE WISE: if you see something they post on Instagram, don't waste your time driving over to buy something. Just call.  That's the name of the game when the item is high demand. Personally, I think they should prioritize customers who show up in person, but their M.O. works for them, so who I am to criticize? I've been a loyal PLRG follower/shopper for a long time. But today I'm super-bummed and, honestly, I will probably unfollow them on Instagram because this is how it has been going lately when I see something I like on their IG feed. It's like a strategic sport! As much as I like PLRG, My Sister's Closet is less stressful because you're not competing with 12K other PLRG followers on IG, ha!  I'll continue to shop there, just with no expectations created by Instagram.  With all of this said, good luck to all you PLRG followers/shoppers and happy shopping!

UPDATE: subsequent to my review, I received a heartfelt message from the owner, who *does read* these reviews.  I appreciated the simple fact that she reached out to me--probably more than she can realize--so I've updated my rating.  Customer service is the real commodity these days.  The PLRG owner has it.

For starters, they are tucked away in a really weird spot.  Its in the ASU center, and if you did not know it was there, I really don't know how you would find it.  It's also a rather small location, so there is actually no seating inside the place.  All you can really do is place an order, and take it to go.

The few times I have been in there, the service has been pleasant, but not great.  There is a guy who has waited on me before, and I believe he is either the owner, or a manager.  He's friendly and nice, but always involved in a conversation with someone else.  It seemed like the people that he was talking to were his friends, and I had to wait for him to finish talking to them before I could get any service.  Plus, its not like hes neccesarily ""waiting"" on them.  He's ""shooting the breeze"" so to say.  Can you say annoying?  Im on lunch hour here people, I don't have time to play games.  I just want to eat my lunch and be done with it, ya know?

Anyways, they seem to have a decent menu of items, but the prices are ridiculously expensive.  I can't believe how much this guy charges for his sandwiches.  like $7 for a cheapo sandwich.

For a while, she has recommended Door FiftyFive to me. We finally decided to go there after work on a Thursday night.

It's a cute restaurant and bar. I loved how the whisky bottles and bar area were lit up in purple.

We got a booth and looked over the menu. I asked if they had mint juleps. They used to, but didn't any more. The menu has southern items, so I thought that I'd ask. Our server, who was also the bartender, said that she could make me a mojito. I said yes. I'm glad that she did, because this mojito was outstanding! It was so flavourful and refreshing, without overdoing the simple syrup in it.

My gut instinct was to get the chicken and waffles. My friend got it and has always highly recommended it. However, I looked at the appetizers and had to ditch my original plan.

I wanted to get the chicken and dumplings soup. I was advised that the restaurant was out of it. Instead, I got the Return of the Mack, which was maple boar bacon in your mac and cheese. I also got the up in smoke big boy chicken wings in a dry rub. It came with buffalo and creamy mayo sauces for dipping.

As an appetizer, we shared the fried mozzarella sticks. I normally don't go for them, but these sticks were yummy. I loved the crispy breading and how stretchy the mozzarella was. So good!

My food came. The chicken wings were scrumptious. They were huge! It's like the chickens did weight training and steroids. I got five of them, which filled me up. The mac and cheese was amazing. The maple boar bacon had the perfect balance of sweetness and smokiness. The mac and cheese was gooey and comforting.

A band was setting up just behind us. We didn't stay late enough to enjoy the music.

The washrooms are downstairs. I had a bit of trouble getting the lock undone in my stall, as it's black metal on black metal. No, I didn't drink a ton. It was just dark. I managed to figure it out. The washrooms were clean and had a rustic look and feel in design.

I had a good time here. There is a patio. It was so hot outside that we opted to stay indoors.

I hope to come back to try the chicken and dumplings soup, as well as the chicken and waffles.

She used a cream and a scrub, and then that was the end...not any of the normal treatments or tools.

Coming here, as I have reviewed before, is to come to a place of childhood memories. Where good things happened. So, it was to my big dismay that this Saturday's experience was as cold as ever.

First, the two gentleman hosts were not here to greet us. They are both older, but always happy to see the Wongs. This time, I was surprised to see two younger men who obviously didn't know who we were. They still greeted us and by any standards, were polite and gracious. But there was no warmth and I knew we wouldn't sit upstairs at our favorite location. Instead, we were trucked to the lowest floor of the restaurant right by the exit door. My dad had a view of someone's feet from the floor directly above us. It was a dark and creepy corner of the restaurant.

Then dinner. For those of you who have wished for a menu change, you got it. They have new food items: Grilled Atlantic Salmon (replaces the Broiled version), Porterhouse steak for two, Veal Chop, and Halibut...to name a few additions. New dessert items as well. Prices have, obviously, increased.

Now, here is where I was ticked. Before, every main course came with a salad or soup appetizer (no additional charge). They no longer do that. So, soup (the daily soup option) is an additional $6 and change, and then salad, a whopping $9 and change. But the salad and soups are still the same - they come in that mid-sized plate and all you get for the salad are iceberg leaves and sauce. Nothing else. And for $9? They changed the price, but nothing else. If you want to charge this high for cheap leaves, than you better start adding Cheese from the Highlands and Olives hand-picked from the Andalusia mountains. 

One of the best value meals just became less so. You still get the garlic bread with Cottage Cheese and Pickles with your meals. But as a customer for over 15 years, I am not impressed. 

The Escargots were really salty this time. My duck was the highlight of the meal (oh so tender and juicy), but my dad's version was tough and not great. So, already, inconsistencies for the same dish.

Service was not the best. It was a busy Saturday night so food was slow to come out. Our waiter knew us before and acknowledged us, but another Waiter forgot our coffees and charged us for it. Than at the end, because he was lazy, asked if we just wanted our coffees. No. We wanted to go home because we had waited long enough for our drinks. So he had to redo the bill, but not our problem.

Overall, I was disappointed. It's like coming home to find all your furniture has been re-arranged without your knowledge (and for the worse at that). That feeling of great unsettlement.",2013-05-27 14:38:24

My boyfriend has not been so lucky, he has had to send food back twice. The first time it was for a steak that was brought out bloody when he ordered it medium rare. The second time was ridiculous, he ordered eggs over hard and they came out runny, he sent them back and they came back BLACK. I didn't think it was possible to burn and egg like that.

This spot is frequented by mostly Asians who are younger working professionals/students. When you enter it's dark pumping with music almost like a club but there's actually a cosy and relaxed patio at the back. I highly recommend to check out the patio! It's a great environment for a date or even a group friends to catch up. Even though people are in their own ""cliques"", from our experience, they are friendly and sometimes engage in conversation with you (we're not Korean btw).

The price is reasonable with a variety of combos, great for sharing - you choose one main dish and it comes with fries and refillable snacks (popcorn, buttery/cheesy corn, tofu, etc) and drinks (4 beers or 1 bottle of soju) to share. All for about $23-$30 depending on the dish you choose. It is enough to feed two people if you're not too hungry/not big eaters. Love the corn!! We got the spicy pork (~$26 with the combo) but the other dishes look good too! 

There are only like 1 or 2 servers for the whole patio so expect slower service but it's faster if you order more drinks haha. I would check back here again because I like the vibe, which is quite different than the typical bar scene.",2017-06-25 21:16:27

i will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!
ok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.
the rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.
i'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together.",2014-05-19 21:17:12

Recently I was in the mood for great Indian cuisine but did not have any desire to sit in a restaurant.  So, having heard mostly positive things about Copper, I made the decision to place an order for pick-up.

Food - I ordered the Khoya Malai Maans which consisted of chunks of lamb in a red curry sauce w/ whole toasted spices. This was accompanied with a pan of basmati rice.  I also ordered the Plain Naan (buttered) and the Saffron, Almond, Paneer Kulcha.  This along w/ a chicken curry dish for my g/f came out to be about $50, which I thought to be extremely expensive.  Maybe I have just been spoiled by the India Garden in Pittsburgh, PA (near the University of Pitt http://www.indiagarden.net/ ) that offers 50% dine-in dinners every night after 11 PM or maybe this was just freakin' expensive!!  Anyway, being that this was so pricey I expected to be blown away.  I was not.  While the g/f's chicken dish was tasty and well made, my dish consisted of diced lamb that was on the tough side.  The spices of the dish were great but tough lamb is something a good Indian restaurant should never have on your plate.  The naan was ""okay"" and the Kulcha was tasteless.  I was left pretty disappointed.

Service - Order was taken promptly over the phone and there were no errors w/ what I had ordered.

Overall - With this experience, I now cannot wait until Thanksgiving week to head over to the Oakland area of Pittsburgh, sit down, and order some very tasty Indian food.  I hope I do not get arrested while there because I now realize the place in Pittsburgh has a steal of a meal.

PS - I will provide a review of Indian Garden while there a month from now.",2008-10-20 23:37:09

Victory was delivered in the form of carrot cake pancakes. They are, for lack of better terminology, the bee's knees. The butterfly's shins. The wasp's ankles. You get the idea. Two fluffy pancakes studded with thick carrot ribbons, spices, and a delicious dose of sweetness independent of the maple syrup and fresh fruit they were served with. These are better than carrot cake... and I don't consider too many things in this world better than carrot cake.

On a very mildly unpleasant note, one cake was slightly undercooked in the middle. However, I have no fear of vegan pancake batter and proceeded to shove the entire thing in my mouth anyway. I washed that down with a ""field of greens"" juice (it tastes like it has the power to cure hundreds of ailments), and deemed myself full and satisfied.

Then, I noticed a little sliver of pie sitting in the fridge. Just a sad, single sliver. I had to inquire.. it looked so lonesome. Turns out it was chocolate caramel turtle pie. Vegan, raw, gluten-free, chocolate caramel turtle pie with a nut crust, salted caramel sauce, pepitas and pecans on top. I don't need to explain what happened next, just know that it was beautiful. Worth every one of the 650 pennies I shelled out for it.

So my wife hauled me kicking and screaming to Netflix and chill with some k-pop drama - but without the chill.  Boo.

After an hour in I was hooked.  Coffee Prince it was called.  About some girl posing as a guy at a Korean cafe.  Good watch.  Highly recommend.  This is that show in Vegas.  This is the coolest cafe in Vegas.  People know it too.  This isn't a place to bring schoolwork or drafting projects from work, though a few people do.  This is a place to relax and enjoy someone's company.

Oh?  What was well played?  The restrooms.  Asian establishments are the cleanest places around but this is a rare exception.  Clean.

The natural stripes and deep reds of the rocks are ridiculous! Also, crazy tall peaks and sheer rock walls. You will gawk at the beauty of this place, guaranteed. 

Since it's just ONE slow road ONE way around the park (dumb design) you need to plan a little, so here goes:

I recommend stopping at Calico Hills first. It's just beyond the visitor center and  this is your best chance to get up close and personal with the famous red stripey rocks. This is less of a trail and more of a rock scramble. You can get some great photos here.

Then keep driving through the park  and enjoy the various look out points, but don't leave until you've done the First Creek Trail (the very last official trail head before you leave the park). It's a short hike and there's a pretty little waterfall that you play under. We've seen burros on this trail.

I ordered a regular poke bowl from King Kuma, which doesn't look like a lot of food for $10, but it is densely packed with fresh, hand-prepared ingredients. Plus I still had room for a chocolate milkshake from La Royale (which was acceptable but by no means life changing). Look out: the wasabi is the real deal. My companion ordered a Mexican-Korean bowl from Muchado. Although he was impressed by the Red Dragon sauce when he was allowed to taste test it before ordering, he reported that the final product was rather bland once the other components were added. He got a vanilla milkshake. One of the servers bused our table, and by the time we left in the middle of the lunch hour, the small parking lot was full.

Food: I ordered the grilled pork with shredded pork and steamed egg on rice. As I was eating my shredded pork, I found a long strand of HAIR in my food!!!!!

However I question how clean they are in the kitchen and whether they take proper procedures in the kitchen. I told the staff and he just told me he will give me a new one... and I just said no thanks because I just don't trust their batch of shredded pork anymore ...

While Jimmy John's is head and shoulders above Subway, Quizno's and other sandwich chains, I just don't find it better than the dozens of smaller sandwich shops and delis around (although I will give it the benefit of lower prices). 

What really sets Jimmy John's apart is online ordering and delivery. That's something hard to find in this area for this kind of food. And like a lot of people in this brave new world, I seem to enjoy minimizing human contact when it I can use my computer instead. Here's an important tip, If you're going to get food from Jimmy John's for lunch on a weekday, be sure to order and pay for it online. I avoided the line by walking straight up to the pickup area, and asking the guy for the order I already paid for. It would actually be nice, if Jimmy Johns had a spot to pick up online orders. Why should I wait in line if I was smart enough to take advantage of this service? The website is simple to navigate through and you can easily ask for more or less of any condiment you want to add or delete. My sandwich was made exactly how I ordered it. 

As for the food itself. It's great for a quick service sandwich shop. I had the country club on wheat. The ham and turkey is good. The condiments were as good and fresh as your going to get at a sandwich chain. The bread is awesome, but there is way too much of it. Every bite had more than double the bread than the meat and toppings combined. Even as a carboholic, I'm turned off by this ratio.

Rick Moonen's restaurants don't disappoint and I was fired up for something aside from fancy-shmans seafood.  This place has a VERY cool theme - I love the decor, LOVE LOVE the uniforms (each server wearing something unique), and the overall vibe.

Here's the breakdown:
The drinks were very inventive and although not every one we tried knocked our socks off, there were a few gems.
1/2 star for a cool drink menu

Food:
Chick pot pie nuggets 3.5/5 - there were great conceptually, but a little bland.
French Onion Dip Sandwich - 1/5 - the sandwich was very bland and oddly, needed salt or something simple to fix it.  I was hoping the au jus would do the trick,but even the au jus was bland. :(
Fried Oxtail - 2/5 - again, great concept...but unlike the french dip, this was SUPER salty.  Texture was great, but it was way too salty to enjoy.
Mac and Cheese - 7/5!! If nothing else, you MUST go here for the mac and cheese.  Really delicious - crunchy on top, perfect creaminess, perfect texture.  YUM.
1/2 star for the Mac and Cheese alone, 1/2 for the creativity of the menu.

Service:
Adorable hostesses, great outfits.
The server was...well, um...not amazing.  We ordered drinks and some appies, and the appies arrived BEFORE our drinks.  ...What?  Then, during the first round, she asked if we wanted to order anything else, we said - we're good for a few minutes...and then she took the menus.  ...What?  We were a group of 4 people and had only order two appies thus far.  Weird.
So, after a few minutes, we get another menu and again order drinks and more appies...and AGAIN, the food came first.  SO very odd.
The saving grace was that the ""apprentice"" who served our water was FAB.  We got all our food and drink recommendations from her and would probably go back just because she was so good.
1/2 star for the service - thanks to the ""apprentice.""

One Fun Surprise:
Rick Moonen stopped by our table to ask how everything was.  That is awesome.  The guy has a whole host of restaurants in Vegas, so I love that personal touch...of course, it was the second day they were open, so it makes sense.  Still, I love that he took the time to make that impact.
1 Star for Rick Moonen.

Overall:
This is a new restaurant - they're clearly still working out the kinks.  I'd go back on a date or something if I was in the area.  I'd like to give this place 6 months to figure things out and then try again - or at the least, grab appies upstairs and do dinner at RM Seafood downstairs.",2013-07-09 19:35:33

Me and 3 girlfriends grabbed lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. I tried calling the night before to make reservations for dinner but they only take reservations for 8 or more people. They said typically for weekend dinners, people start arriving by buses, so just be prepared to wait!

We ordered the Hobak Family combo, which comes with a combo of beef and pork. The side dishes weren't bad but I was disappointed with the salad because it wasn't the traditional Korean dressing.

We were very familiar with Michael Mina's steakhouse concept having enjoyed his Bourbon Steak, one of our favorite places in DC, on multiple occasions.  As a result, we had high expectations for Stripsteak.  Stripsteak occupies an open, modern-looking, high-ceilinged, well-lit space along Restaurant Row in Mandalay Bay.  Since we had early reservations at 6pm, the dining room was virtually empty except for us.  Given that we practically had the place to ourselves, the service was solid and our food came out expeditiously, hot and fresh throughout our meal.

Our meal started out with Mina's signature amuse of Duck Fat Fries with a trio of dipping sauces.  The fries were hot and crispy.  They were a nice prelude to our meal, but still...just fries.  Stripsteak's strength is in its wood-fire grilled proteins.  I had the 8 oz. American Wagyu Rib Cap, medium rare.  My rib cap came out cooked precisely to my requested doneness, seasoned with restraint with only salt and pepper, was fork tender, and was, not unexpectedly, wonderfully juicy and flavorful.  It was the perfect treatment of this treasured cut of meat.  We shared orders of the Roasted Wild Mushrooms and Mac & Cheese with black truffle sides.  The mushrooms, a mix of maitake, oyster, and possibly another variety, were earthy, tender, and possessed subtle smoky notes from the wood-fire roasting.  The mac & cheese possessed distinct but balanced truffle flavor.  It was a solid and enjoyable upscale rendition of a comfort food staple.

Stripsteak served up an excellent meal that lived up to our expectations.  As steak joints go, it held its own with Las Vegas' best steakhouses.  It's not for the budget-conscious, but thankfully on this evening, my buddy picked up the tab.  4.5 stars!",2014-02-17 22:48:42

Once we entered the restaurant, a waiter took our order for appetizers. He then brought out a paper where we would fill it out and write how many pieces of nigiri, rolls, and other items. I swear that we ordered fewer nigiri than showed up, but they never gave me the paper back, 

The service is pretty fast. Our sushi just kept coming and coming and coming.  At one point, one of the servers asked if we still wanted our yuzu yellowtail because we had so much food on the table. The servers kept coming by and asking us if everything was alright. They gave us our check once we ordered dessert, but then they took forever to take payment. It was like they stopped checking up on us after then. 

They only allow 1 order per person of the specials which including the screaming o, salmon belly, avocado bomb, and mango salmon. I was bit sad that they only offered 1 order of salmon belly person. The shrimp came with huge fried shrimp on the side, and it only came with one shrimp per order. It was also only one order of ocean trout. 

One of the things I didn't like was the different sauces that they put on top. I would rather just eat the fish by itself. 

Now, some of the information on yelp has changed. Out of green tea panna cotta, black sesame dessert, mochi, fried bananas, tempura ice cream, and mini honey toast, you could only pick one which bummed me out because that's my favorite part. I believe they allow unlimited ice cream or at least they didn't have a limit on it. The oysters are seasonal, so they didn't have any. They no longer serve soft shell crab.

They do offer 2 for 1 alcoholic. My friends ordered a yogurt soju. The soju was pretty good, but the drink size was pretty small. That's probably why it's such a deal!",2015-01-31 21:08:26

My favorite AYCE KBBQ spot in Chinatown is Hwaro for it's variety but when I only want a lot of brisket and just a few sides (which includes just salad , steamed egg and hot tofu soup for me) then Lee's is definitely the place to go to. Plus , their wait times are not bad at all. We're often seated right away here. I usually get their Combo C (which is their cheapest option for 19.99$) since I'm satisfied with just brisket (although I tried their other options and they're excellent as well). Meat quality is very good for an AYCE place compared to other AYCE places around town. They aren't stingy with the meat portions either. Must also mention that their bulgogi is perfectly marinated. I hardly order bulgogi at AYCE besides this place. Make sure to ask for fermented soybean paste on the side for your meats. The cast iron grill they use is so efficient.

U4ZVdxlxerwYCwvaZrHi3g,qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,HRLHrJudlNsmtY-je3PDLQ,5,10,7,9,"""The palace of foot massage"" This is my official nickname for Good Foot Massage simply because it is my new favorite. Maybe there was magic in the air or maybe it was the vintage Jordache cologne, but I loved everything about the Good Foot.

We arrived at Good Foot as a result of Yelp ""Treasure Hunt"". There is the mythic foot massager Rex, and he keeps popping up in different reviews, but my husband and I had always seen him at Tibet. Then, Nancy W. posted a review of Traditional Foot Massage with a different address and there was Rex again! (http://www.yelp.com/biz/traditional-foot-massage-las-vegas#hrid:pU8xl0zPZhlC6obd1AszGQ) I deduced that Rex had moved from Tibet Foot Massage, and that is how we arrived at Good Foot, which I think is its official name. I think they just have fliers that say ""Traditional Foot Massage"" to explain what foot massage is. The name game gets a bit confusing in Chinatown, but they are between Arville and Decatur near Joyful House with a bright green sign announcing ""Foot Massage"" on the side of the building. It only says Good Foot on the business cards. 

My boy went inside to search for Rex. The lady did not know his English name, so she pulled out a list, and then, Rex magically appeared from one of the rooms! Rex is awesome. He is funny and kind and really works to provide great customer service. 

Anyways, the place is big and clean with separate rooms, not one big space with a bunch of recliners. The recliners are brilliant because they are part recliner, part massage table, so when you flip over, there is actually a hole for your head! You don't have to suffocate and/or turn your head to the side. They accept credit cards! Huge deal for me. And, they have a punch card to earn a free massage.

The massage itself is top notch. With an hour massage, they start with your head and face-- splendid! They move to your feet, and then finish on your back. Thorough. Rex is the man for high pressure. I had Tina, and she was perfect pressure without pain, very therapeutic. The lotion smells like pineapple, which I really like. I appreciated having that added sensory dimension of smell, which brings me to the Jordache cologne. 

When Tina first came into the room, I thought her cologne might bother me, but by the end of the massage it had grown on me. Anyways, I went to the restroom and there was a bottle of a Jordache inspired cologne on the sink. That was the scent. I just think that makes the experience more classic and memorable. Scent is the sense most strongly correlated with memory, so whether or not it is intentional, I think Good Foot is onto something with the scented lotion and Jordache.

As for price, it is the same as every other foot massage place: around $19 for half hour, around $38 for full hour.

My only complaint is that I did not get a Hello Kitty charm like Nancy W., but if I could give Good Foot 6-stars, I would, so consider them docked one star, but still shining (and smelling) bright.",2010-02-16 18:16:02

Unfortunately, we encountered service issues all night. Overall, the waitstaff seemed very slow and inattentive - which is amazing considering how many staff they seem to have just standing around - and I think some of the problems indicate poor management and training. Most noticeable was that we often had to flag down waiters to get our wine and water refilled. The food runners also kept putting food in front of the wrong people - this happened with our appetizers, entrees, and even after-dinner drinks! The most mind-boggling service failure occurred when the runners brought out all appetizers, salads, and soups at the same time, leaving a bunch of appetizers to be chucked in the middle of the table vaguely near the person who ordered them (and only after we told the runners who had ordered what).

Also, I think the way Prime does the table settings and places food could be improved; we were at a larger round table and it felt like waiters were constantly leaning over us to get to stuff nearer the middle of the table - personal space violations abound!

And even given the service problems, Prime's biggest failing was that our steaks were very poorly prepared. Mine was perhaps the worst; they offered a bone-in filet as a special, which I ordered medium rare but came out extreme 'black and blue' - gushing red in the middle while being charred on the outside. Several party members noted they had steaks that were overcooked. The steak was also very, very salty.

Originally, I was going to give +1* because of some solid sides, including the truffle mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, gnocchi, and Brussels sprouts; also, my tuna ribbons appetizer was tasty, with a nice spicy kick to the accompanying sauce. The problem is, who goes to Prime for appetizers and sides and ignores the steak and bad service? I wouldn't, and even though Prime is closer to a 1.5, that's why I can't in good faith rate any higher than 1*.",2014-03-23 23:50:21

High tech equipment, an abundance of free weights, dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, TRX, and a great variety of weight machines. And most importantly (to me at least), the cardio machines all have TV's with dozens and dozens of channels (unlike Most gyms who either don't have TV's on the machines OR they do but only have 10 channels and 8 of them suck). If I'm on the stair master or arc trainer for 40 minutes, I need a TV to take my mind of the agony I'm putting myself though. This is not negotiable.

I've only taken two cycling classes here but I truly enjoyed them. Both instructors were great & played awesome music. The cycling room is pitch dark (which helps keep the room cool temperatures wise) and lit with black lights. They keep it very comfy with blasting AC and low ceiling fans. I wish LA Fitness would take a lesson from Smart Gym with regard to this!

The broth lacked depth and flavour, I had to add red chili pepper for more flavour. The noodles were nothing special and resembled instant noodles. There was nothing outstanding to comment on and in short, it was quite disappointing.

""The Ultimate Steak"" platter, 120oz of steak for $250 - DELICIOUS!!!!! -The steak is cut into thin slices for your entire party to enjoy, so you don't have to worry about dividing it up.  We had it medium rare and it came out PERFECT.  Slightly bloody, juicy, and tender.  Just writing this review makes me mouth-water for it!!  

We had a party of 5 guys and 1 girl sharing this and we were all STUFFED w/o any leftovers (keep in mind 3 guys in my party were over 200 lbs).  You can probably get away w/ 7-8 people sharing this monster.  Plus for the price?  $250 seems like a lot but split between 6 people is $40 a head.   Score!!

Sides
Macaroni & Cheese - Above average - The Mac & Cheese is delicious.  It came out baked and was still crunchy (I hate when it's creamy/runny).  Worth it.
Cream Spinach - Average - Wasn't anything memorable, standard spinach.  

Dessert-
NY Style Cheesecake ($10) - Exceptional - This is a delicious dessert!! The cheesecake is rich & thick.  I was amazed w/ every bite I ate.  
Strawberry baked Alaska ($10) - Average.  Don't remember it being any memorable. I'd pass on this.
Grilled Banana Smores ($10) - Below average.  This was ok, but wasn't anything special.  You can buy all the stuff at home for half the price and it'll taste the same.  I'd suggest asking for extra graham crackers tho.

-Bread is complimentary UPON REQUEST.  Ask for bread!  It's delicious too.

I will get her name next time I go in. They really need to get rid of her. I'm 6'1 and 240 lbs and she tries to bully me into buying what she thinks I should buy. I can't imagine what she does to other ppl she can actually intimidate. My wife and i were mad about it for about an hour after we left the store and ruined our chill Sunday mostly because this is a regular occurence with this lady. 

Anyway, everytime we go in she tries to sell me a certain brand of dog food that i do not use. I told her I use Earthborn Holistic dry food which is the one of the highest rated dog foods you can get and I don't buy it at Petsmart because they do not carry it. She is the typical know it all lady. She made a face like it was some cheap brand but it's $55 a bag and if you look on Dog Food Advisor sites it is about 1-2 stars higher than the shit kind she was trying to sell me. This was not a one time thing, she does it to me every single time I go in. The next time I won't be so nice. I'm only nice because she is an animal lover obviously but she talks down to my wife and I about what we buy for our pets and made us feel uncomfortable for about the 4-5th time. If she would do some research she would maybe consider switching to the food we buy which is like going to Whole Foods for our dogs.

We bought some Blue Buffalo senior food which is another high end food, top of the line for one of our older dogs which I told her and she ignored. She then made a comment as we walked away saying I can't believe you would buy your senior Little Cesars wet food which we only bought a handful of because they were on sale and it was her own place of employments featured product. We havent bought that kind ever before. It was more of a snack for our other dogs. IT WAS NOT FOR OUR SENIOR DOG AS I STATED EARLIER DURING THE CONVERSATION LADY!!!!!  

We only go to this store based on convenience as it is the closest to us right now. I'm serioulsy considering switching to Petco which is a bit further down the street on Warm Springs. I also miss shopping at Paw Prints in Henderson. It is far away from us now that we moved but I might have to start making trips back there more regularly. We have dogs and cats in our household and spend alot of money at Petsmart to be talked down to. I'm definitely going to make another trip there to at least get her name to add to this post. I hope the manager does something about it because it is pretty shitty to have someone talk to consistent customers like that.",2015-03-16 20:12:37

Take a salad and make it better
Organic to make it healthy for my heart
Then you can start to make my burger

Hey Joe, don't be afraid
I was made to go out and Yelp you
The minute you let try your onion rings
Then I begin to feel a lot better

And anytime I feel hungry pains, hey Joe's Farm Grill
Please carry some fries and bacon burgers
For well you know that it's Bo Bites who eats and sings
By making your world a little tastier

It's Joe's from Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives!

Yes, this sweet spot has been around for some times and always a pleasure to visit.  Service here is always on spot and just having the ability to walk around the yard is fun.  The Coffee Shop next doors bakes up a storm and the farmers market is always cool to explore.  

I came to Joe's after a run with a friend so we were pretty hungry!  I went for the Fontina Burger with Onion Rings, while she ordered the Ahi Sandwich with Beets.  My burger was cooked to perfection while the peppers and fontina cheese gave it a lovely sweet pop.  I would say they have the softest bun around and it just literally melts in your mouth.  The Onion rings were fresh and crunchy with every bite.  My friends Ahi Sandwich had the same bun, but within was a large slab of tuna with some slaw.  Overall, a crunchiness of the slaw gave it some texture while the wasabi mayo provided some heat.  The tuna itself was cooked lightly seared so you had somewhat of a sashimi taste to it.  

In the end, Joe's Farm Grill is always a recommendation whenever someone ask me about a great place to eat.  The experience itself is always great because of the atmosphere it has and the food is always consistent! - Enjoy!",2016-01-25 20:15:52

The scallops were seasoned to perfection and not over cooked.  My salad had goat's cheese and arugula that was well-washed and flavorful.  I had a peanut butter and chocolate tower for dessert that was finger licking good!

When I explain The Farm Grill to people I tell them it's food on a farm in a high tech, modern environment. I mean where else can you eat at a farm restaurant that has a condiment flushing system, TVs in the restrooms (that shows the same movie every time) and broadcasts 90s indie music on the speakers?

Remember the scene in Pulp fiction where Uma Thurman orders a milk shake and Travolta asks for a sip because he wants to know what a $5 milk shake tastes like? Well these shakes, particularly the chocolate malt, is worthy of the $4.30 price tag. I've never tried the ribs

The biggest problem with the Farm Grill is flies. I stop eating there in the late spring / early summer each year because the flies are unbearable, even indoors. 

Depending on the time of day the lines get very big and the place doesn't open multiple registers. Food usually comes out quickly though no matter how crowded it is.

Due to the fact that this place is in east Gilbert the clientele is very white and very mormon. There are more pregnant women and young children at The Farm Grill on a weekend afternoon than there are in some maternity wards. 

If you can stand eating among large families and battling traffic to refill your own drinks and condiment cups, the Farm Grill is a good choice for the meat loving crowd. Just avoid it during the warm weather season because no one should spend $12 on a meal and feel the need to devour it as quick as possible just to avoid a fly infestation.

They are now open for breakfast too.",2008-07-04 20:52:37

Holy packed store Batman. The aisles are all kind of cramped together. If you are claustrophobic, you may have troubles shopping here. No way my mom could handle this place.

I wandered around for a good hour... just in awe of everything. And I mean EVERYTHING. It's like Pinterest jumped out of the Internet and exploded inside a store. Every craft item imaginable.

Since I'm not very good at shopping, I did bring a list with me. And I, of course, couldn't find items on it. A very nice worker recognized the look on my face... the look of a person lost and confused. She pointed me in the right direction. Shopping list completed.

DSL and wireless 4G speeds don't come close (especially when it comes to upload speeds).  Additionally, wireless 4G has problems with penetration; it will work fine outside but has signal problems inside.

As for television alternatives (satellite and century link), you can do okay.  I'm sort of stuck with cox at the moment since I am a padres fan and they are only shown on cox.

Recently I moved my service from one cox serviced location to another.  I signed up for the move on cox's website.

They were pretty deceptive when it came to the installation method.  The default method was ""self install"" which would cost $20.  If I wasn't curious, I wouldn't have clicked on ""full install"" and learned that method would be free.  Had I not been curious I would just assume that the self install was cheaper and I would have ordered that.

It started to get close to the day I had requested installation and I had no confirmation that they would come.  I called, and a good thing I did.  They had somehow lost my order and I never got installation scheduled.  Over the phone I scheduled installation for 5-7pm on a Tuesday.

On Tuesday nobody arrived or called.  I called Cox.  Cox said that someone arrived at 4:30.  Customer Service Rep tried to tell me that my appointment was 3-5pm, which it was not.  When I attempted to reschedule I was told I could not get a 5-7pm window because of the complexity of my install.  Complex?  I had a 5-7pm window before and just a few days ago they were offering self install.

Anyways, It took a week before I could get someone to install.  Install was completed under 30 minutes.  I just wish I didn't have to call Cox every other day and light a fire under their butts.

When the padres tv deal changes next year I am probably leaving cox for satellite tv.  Unfortunately I'll likely stick with cox for internet though.",2011-08-15 19:54:51

Though only a small bubbletea store, they have a seating area that was basically filled when I got there around 5pm on a Thursday.

Check in: Check in was a breeze, it wasn't challenging at all.

Room: The rooms here are pretty nice, they seem spacious and very comfortable. The shampoo/body wash are in dispensers on the wall and it appears to be the lowest quality goop they could find- so your skin will be dryer than the Sahara after using it. The room has a fridge in it which is a real plus.

Casino: The casino is large, but has this inexplicable feeling of lifelessness and seemed rather desolate, but they play a lot of oldies which i love and the Pinups bar was a nice place to relax.

Service: The service is hit or miss depending on who you speak with. I made a room charge, the person said i was all set but didn't have me sign a receipt ....SOOOOO bight and early at 06:30 AM I get a call from the Cafe asking if i made a room charge and what time can i come sign a receipt?.....Then they call BACK to ask if they can send Security up to me so i can sign it which is great, but calling me at 630 am?!! Then the icing on the cake was when they ""tested"" their emergency PA system waking me up a a couple of hours later......geez.

This was my first time actually eating at this location cause I really wanted to eat breakfast here, so my husband took me. I ordered steak and egg on an everything bagel and asked for an apple. They told me that they don't serve an apple with my sandwich. I was honestly upset because Panera Bread is an international franchise  and they should do things the same.

I told the cashier that in America they give sides with their dishes and she said ""well this is Canada so we do things differently here"" in an attitude! 
I was so upset and I had to walk away and my husband finished his order.

Also, I used to work at Panera when I lived in the States and I told the cashier named Heather that they usually give sides with their sandwiches. And she just didn't want to listen to me, a customer who is supposed to be right. She just should've given me my apple and mind her manners.....  

Then she asked me if I had a reward number... EXCUSE ME?!!! I told her no because it's a number from the states and that's when I almost lost it.  So Panera management if you want me to write a better review on your location, please private message me so we can work this out, otherwise, you just lost a very upset customer.

Never came here when it was Beso, but was very pumped to check this place out for Restaurant Week.  We had a 6 p.m. reservation (yeah, with the 80 year olds) and got there a few minutes early.  Although we had the option of getting seated, we decided to have a beer on the patio first.  I'm not sure if it is because this was my Last Supper before my Insanity diet started, but man, that Fat Tire was bomb.

Once we were seated, I started checking out the place.  I liked the atmosphere, although it was on the quiet side.  Then I remembered:  It's 6 o'clock.  Started with some raw oysters which we ordered off the regular menu.  I would say these oysters were nothing special, so we should probably have stuck to RW.  

As far as RW menu goes, I had the chopped salad and my BF had the caesar.  I didn't get a bite, so his must have been good.  My chopped salad was pretty great, especially the candied pecans and the house dressing was just right.  For entrees, we split skirt steak and salmon and shared two sides, wild mushrooms and pureed potatoes.  I really enjoyed all the food, especially the salmon dish which included lentils and pieces of lump crab.  My only real complaint is the same complaint I have for the original Morton's:  Way too much oil on the steak!  I'm a meat lover and all that oil is just wrong.  Dessert was shescake (seriously) and cinnamon twists.  The twists were blah but the shescake more than covered the dessert bases.

Now for the best part:  Around 7:30 this place went nuts.  Girls came out in bustiers and on stilts and things got kind of weird after that but I really enjoyed it!  haha.

After leaving Sport Clips with my pseudo-wannabe hipster haircut, I saw a sign that said 90% OFF EVERYTHING AT BOARDERS! By some random guy in the street.  So I did what any rational human being would do, I decided it was the perfect time to get a shitload of books no one has ever heard about at some obscure price you wouldn't know about.

So far, 5 Stars.

I walk into Boarders, the signs in the store say 70-90% off everything, I was promised 90% off everything!  Boy oh howdy, people who follow my Xanga Web Vlog know how furious I was to figure out that Boarders gave me the good'ole ""rope-a-dope"".

Loses 1 Star

I checked out their book selection, pretty decent considering that everything was about 80% off on average and I was kind of surprised that everything wasn't sold out.

Then, I saw a very beautiful oriental woman just walking around, looking at random books and my first thought was, ""bink"".  My second thought was, ""Hey I'll talk to her"".

Then I pondered on whether or not I should spend time and effort on going after her, after about 2 minutes I figured, ""sure"".  Little did I know while I was pondering, she vanished.

Loses 1 Star.

Well eff that noise, I grabbed a few books that looked decent and worked my wait up to the cashier.  She was in her 60's or something, and since I was in a cheery mood I decided to bust out the small talk.

Joey: Howdy!
Cashier: ...
Joey: Oh boy gettin some cheap books today, good stuff right?
Cashier: ...
Joey: ...
Cashier: $15.31 is your total.
*I pay with debit card*
*Cashier hands it back, doesn't say anything*
Joey: Well you have a good weekend *takes one step away*
*Cashier says nothing*
Joey: *turns back and finger guns her way* LIKEWISE! :D

Loses 1 star and a potential friend that never warmed up to me.

This restaurant is super popular -- with its unique cocktails, modern romantic decor, and tapas style menu this place is sure to hit the spot for dinner. It gets very popular though so I recommend trying to get there before 6 o'clock. They also do not take reservations and will not seat you unless your whole party is there. But back to the food: ordering a bunch of different tapas (and even sushi rolls) is the way to go. I love the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos -- the pork is cooked to such perfection that it literally does melt in your mouth, a very popular tapa among customers. The Lamb Pops are also really good, which are smothered in rosemary, pecorino and pepper. Soul also has good sushi, in which I recommend the Charlotte roll, with tempura shrimp inside.

The Vig is my new fav place to go in Phoenix. here's why: it's a 5min drive from our house. They have free (tipped) valets. They have great Happy Hour specials. The menu has a wide variety of creative delectables suitable to every palate; all priced exactly right. There are so many dishes on it that sound amazing I was instantly planning a return visit my fist time there. I've had the grilled chicken sandwhich with amazing coleslaw and their juicy burger (as a lettuce wrap) which had lightly caramelized red onions which is a nice touch as I dislike totally raw onions but love them blanched. The staff is attractive and friendly. The atmosphere and decor are EXACTLY what I look for in a favorite: dim lighting but tasefully accented. a gorgeous bar with a stunning lit up ""Booze Waterfall"" on the backbar (as a former barman, a nightmare for the staff to clean I'm sure- just gorgeous!) A bar any single could comfortably saddle up to and surf the net or chat with folks. Huge comfy booths that could squeeze in 8 I'm sure, yet they put couples there if they have them available.  Booths that are dim and judging by all the canoodling couples, perfect for date nights- gay and straight given the several same-sex couples I saw one night, which is always a good sign and awesome. A MASSIVE indoor/outdoor lounge with huge windows that easily open on pleasent days and seal out the heat with duct in A/C during triple digit days. Tasteful and ecclectic background music. They can accomodate groups and the lounge which also features bean-bag toss game would be perfect for a corporate or private party. A cornicopia of merrits to be sure!
The only down side for me is that they have a kids menu and the kids also like the bag toss game both of which will encourage families with small kids. I generally detest children and only mildly tolerate any children of friends and family. I'm a proud, childless,""Adults-only"" kind of guy that will walk out of any restaurant containing more than 3 kids total within ear-shot. But for the 2 or 3 Chicken-fingers-and-fries guests that were there on both my visits, I would up the star-rating to a solid 5!

Overall, the ambience was great and they have a great space for sit down meals.  There were a lot of take out orders so it is clear everyone in the area is excited for this place and has high hopes.

There was a bit of misunderstanding between me and the person taking my order, and it was fairly loud.  It would be helpful to fully review the order as we had three items, so we could confirm.  anyway, I didn't argue it, but what they did hear they got correct.  The wait seemed a bit long for burgers, and I am pretty sure that other people who ordered after us got their stuff before we did.

The burgers were decent but I'm not sure I quite taste the impact of the holes in the burgers.  I got the hole e skirt burger and the skirt apparently was a mini skirt because it definitely didn't flow out like in the pictures on their website.  Their poutine could be promising.  I think they need to figure out their flow of prep because the fries were done too early as they weren't piping hot, and the gravy wasn't hot either.  the gravy seemed kind of congealed... maybe there was too much flour... it didn't melt the cheese curds, which to me, MAKES the poutine.  Sorry for the tangent, but if a place is promoting poutine, I feel like it needs to be good.  Costco poutine was better.

I ordered the hot dog for my son (don't judge).  They were really nice and let me add cheese after the fact (yay!), and he ate pretty much the entire hot dog, which was awesome.  He seemed to love the fries, which is a plus.

Appealing to the demographics: there are a lot of young families in the area wanting to go out with their kids, and a lot of ladies on mat leave with babies who need changing.  A few notes to really hit it off with this demographic:
1) have a changing table or put two chairs together to create a makeshift one in one of the washrooms - parents will appreciate it and will continue to bring their kids
2) don't have a designated men or women's washroom when there is only one room... make it unisex.  It would reduce the lines for the bathroom which could crowd your space if you get busy, and if there is someone changing their baby.  Also, it looks like there is only a handicapped washroom available for women and not men.
3) Highchairs - but that is coming I hear.  I hope you have at least 3, if not, there are nice boosters that are usually on sale for $25 or cheaper on craigslist.

All in all, a good start, and I would love more of these establishments around in the area (gentrify faster!), so I am hoping that they are reading this and take note :)",2014-05-04 04:04:33

We have enjoyed both its old location at Stonecrest and its new location at Toringdon (even more.) Its owner Tri is normally onsite checking on customers which is always a huge plus and a good sign. The atmosphere is comfortable and polished. 

I must say upfront that, although service is usually friendly and attentive, it can be spotty at times as some of its servers can be quite temperamental and rude. Ask the manager directly for another if you are not happy with yours. In fact, do this anywhere! You are the customer, for goodness sake, and eating out is expensive, expect and demand good service! 

I'm going to do something that I normally I do not do, which is to start with dessert. Their Tres Leches cake is quite frankly the best we've had anywhere! It is made in house and easily serves two. It is incredibly moist and is made perfectly. The only problem is it spoils you for anywhere else. 

Over the years, we have tried everything on the menu; our favorite however, the Red Snapper, is not on the menu. When it is available as a special we definitely choose it. Of course as you may expect at a Spanish Grille, the paella and Zarzuela, which is like paella stew, are both excellent. 

My go to dish is the Churrasco de Cerdo which is the grilled seasoned pork tenderloin topped with chimichurri sauce, served with Spanish rice, black beans, and plantains for $17. The pork is always tender and flavorful and the sides, especially the plantains, are perfectly prepared. You also can't go wrong with any of the tapas.

All meals are served with bread - soft and warm mini loaves - and if that is fabulous with butter. We always order a house salad with the house vinaigrette and have consistently been pleased. 

Even after all these years, this place remains a Gotta Try. It stays busy though though, if you're going to dinner, be sure to make reservations.",2016-11-20 13:03:47

The meatloaf, I tell ya, was squishy, wet and so bland... She had to send it back, it was very unappetizing.

I would say the portions were stingy. There were maybe 7 green beans on top of the meatloaf?

The hubby and I shared a hummus to start. We were given just 1 pita for it, but if you need more you can get some. The lady asked us if we needed more and she brought us another warm pita. Sides are really nicely priced at $3.50 that get a few to share to make yourself some meze platter.

We both got a 1 chicken and 1 beef koobideh plate. It comes with rice, grilled pepper, grilled tomato, some onions and butter for your rice. The koobideh was pretty juicy and well seasoned. I am hit or miss with chicken ones, but theirs was solid though both the hubby and I preferred the beef kind.

We ordered one square of baklava to share. Theirs wasn't overly sweet and the nuts were toasted nicely. Not bad at all. 

The lady who was serving us was kind and a very humble and gracious type of host. 

Kebabs are one of those things where I see the prices severely swing from cheap to spendy for some ground meat and rice. This place has good quality, good portions and the prices make it for cheap eats when $10 gets you a pile of food. 

I dig it. Many good kebab spots aren't convenient to us so I'm really glad that there is something in the area were normally around. The shopping center is rather quiet so I hope that they get enough traffic to stay open because I think the food is really good homey food.",2015-06-28 02:09:00

This restaurant is first class in all respects from service to food. When we were seated, our server came with a bottle of (very nice) champagne and each of us were poured a glass in celebration of the birthday honoree. In addition, a birthday card signed by all the staff was waiting on our table. That was such a nice beginning to our evening.

The menu consists of small plates, pasta and risotto offerings and regular size entrees. Some plates vary daily such as the charcuterie platter and foie gras. I chose the butternut squash and ham hock agnolotti that was wonderfully light and flavorful along with the butter lettuce salad. My dining companions started with the Oeuf Norwegian which is smoked salmon wrapped around a poached egg. Beautiful presentation and very delicious. They then shared two entrees: the braised lamb tagliatelle and the duck comfit Cassoulet Campagnard. Both dishes got rave reviews. 

From a service standpoint, all went quite well. Our server was informative without being pushy. He was easy going yet very attentive. His wine recommendations were very much in keeping with how we described our tastes. When he brought our dessert choice, he included a small birthday candle. The candle didn't cooperate so he left the dessert but took the candle back to the kitchen only to bring the lit candle back in a small dish for the birthday honoree.

Our evening was enhanced by a visit from Chef Owner Nicholas Tarnate. We were glad we could let him know how nice our evening had been. It's really the small things that make dining an event. Aix en Provence pays close attention to all details and especially to the small things.",2017-02-25 16:15:13

Options for sweets are select, which to me is better than loads and loads of options that are mediocre at best.

I'd recommend the chocolates as a decadent, rich experience.  The brownies are all different and range from cake-ier to more brownie-like.  If you're a sucker for a traditional brownie you may want to ask which ones are more to the texture / consistency you prefer before purchasing.  I've tried approximately 5 and all have different consistencies and flavors are subtle, not punch you in your mouth present.

I've come here for a variety of things over the past year, and most times, I can find it.  The store is laid out like every other home depot, with just about all the same products you can think of. Lumbar, paint, hardware, etc.

I've done a lot of shopping at their nursery, and the plant selection is quite nice.  They have a lot of annuals, but could probably step up their perennial selection plant wise. They have a huge selection of dirt for planters and gardens, buckets, planters and all kinds of gardening tools.

Inside they have tons of stuff to choose from.  If I have a problem finding something or need help, I can grab someone in an orange apron to help me figure it out. Staff is really friendly and helpful, which is great.

I will say, the downside is that if you come here in a Saturday afternoon, sometimes it can be crazy.  I don't mind the crazy atmosphere, but sometimes its hard to find help if you have questions.  Even though the staff is friendly and helpful, they seemed to be shorthanded sometimes, which can prove frustrating.

Here's an example, but it's happened more then once to me.  I was in the nursery last summer and had questions about some plants.  It was busy and I was trying to get assistance to figure out what plant would do better on my patio.  I asked the register girl (who was working in the nursery) and she said she didn't know that much about plants, and needed to call someone to help me.  The guy came out, but ended up helping 3 other people and never got around to helping me.  I stood there for 20 minutes with my plants thinking he was going to come back until the register girl asked if I had gotten the help I needed.  When I said no, the guy came back out, apologized and assisted me with my plant questions.

Was it resolved? Yea.  But this has happened to me more then once. I think they may just need to hire more people, especially for help. I mean, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable for the most part, but when its crazy, it can be hard to get in and out of the store quickly especially when its 110 degrees and you are roasting.

I'll admit that 2 sounds kind of weird: Pineapple | Mango | Spinach | Kale | Banana | Peanut Butter | Almond Milk. Kale and peanut butter?? I don't know how, but it works. And it works reallllly well.

To me, the 5 (Pineapple | Banana | Mint | Cacao Nibs | Whey Protein | Spirulina | Almond Milk) is reminiscent of mint chocolate chip ice cream. I dig those cacao nibs.

BUT.. these walnut cakes were premade from who knows when, and they were SO stale. They were mushy, like when you put away freshly made, hot pancakes directly into a sealed bag/tupperware, and let it sit and cool like that. The outside of the cake was clammy and mushy, and the inside of the cake part was dry. The filling tasted fine, but these cakes definitely needed to be eaten hot and when the edges are a little crispy... He was taking them out from these covered styrofoam containers, and they were not presented the way you seem them in some of the pictures on yelp. 
I understand that they wanted to remain open after selling out the pancakes even when they weren't making anything fresh just to sell what they had left, but i don't understand how they can sell old products without warning the customers. I bet they taste good when they're fresh, but i'm so disappointed in the quality. Maybe one day when I pass by again, I will try them again IF they have something fresh.

As far as AYCE sushi spots go in Markham, this is one of the better ones because of the large variety of dishes. Quality is at or above par as other AYCE sushi establishments.  Sushi on 7 (across the street) is pretty good as well, but seating is limited there so you'll have an easier time finding a table at Yang's on a weekend.

What sets Yang's apart is that Yang's has a greater number and variety of dishes at Yang's than other AYCE sushi places, including a about 12-16 items from the grill such as salmon belly, salmon head, mackerel, sole filets and have some items such as salmon tataki, beef tataki and eel pancake that other AYCE sushi places don't have.  

The sushi is good, I've only had one or two experiences in the many times I've gone here where the sushi was still really cold.  Considering how busy they are they get food out to you quickly.  Do be warned that they seem to run out of some items later at night, this past weekend they were out of seaweed salad and steamed egg. 

They have an assortment of ramen, udon and fried rices as well. 

Desserts are your typical AYCE fare of ice cream and fried banana (which aren't very good, but there aren't many AYCE places with good friend banana anyway). 

It's about $29 (tip and tax included) for dinner on a weekend, and I think about $26 on a weekday.

Let me give you a little background as I had only been to one of these for sandwiches in California before I moved to sunny AZ.  First you pick a brown bag with the basic type of sandwich meat. You can get pork, chicken, beef, cold cuts, crab meat salad- anything you'd want. Then you mark the size of your sandwich, cheese and veggie toppings to your hearts desire. It's all reasonably priced from about $7-$10 and the sandwiches are toasted and treated with care. I also always get excellent customer service when I go. They also bake their own fresh cookies, which you can get as an ice cream cookie sandwich, and rice krispie treats too!
They have cool specialty sandwiches like the monte christo, or the surf n turf (roast beef with crab salad) which are worth a try if you are feeling particularly adventurous.

My favorite part though is that you can get it as a lettuce wrap sandwich or salad bowl for $7. a gyro lettuce wrap with tzatziki will really hit the spot when your cravin some greek :)",2016-01-25 23:50:19

I came here on the recommendation of other fellow yelpers and my own desire to see what this place is about.  I got here early, right after opening because I wanted to take the whole thing in at my leisure.  Driving in is beautiful enough with a long windy road full of beautiful gardens.  I parked in the garage and walked in and was blown away at the initial beauty of this place, and it was breathtaking, even in the lobby/entrance area.  I spoke with a lady at the information desk about the layout of the place, and she spend a few minutes going over the map and what to see and do here.  

My first stop was the original museum built many moons ago.  (1916?)  Beautiful art displays of floral paintings, a section of Jesus stuff from all over the world that was hundreds of years old and so much more.  I worked my way slowly through the museum, taking the whole thing in.

Eventually I worked my way throughout, and was impressed at the extensive collection of art from just about every artist ever known.  Some of my favorite displays were Monet, the Persian Tent (HOLY COW that was AWESOME and beautiful!)  The display of the body iron things that people used to wear way back when and much more. Those were a few of the things that still stick out in my mind.

While here, there was a Pharaoh exhibit on loan that was an additional $15. I saved that for last because I wasn't sure if I was going to have the energy to see it with all the ground I had to cover with the rest of the museum.  At the end of my tour, I felt good enough to hit it, and boy, that was pretty cool.  It's not the biggest display, but impressive enough that I'm glad I did it.

o7bBSHO6H-rV4cBbGtis-A,55e_HUm0WQ64rT0kIixiXA,079CV1EE5WLdQqVEVYFeHQ,5,0,0,0,Stopped into the Prime on a Monday for a birthday dinner. We had the restaurant to ourselves when we walked in at 8:20pm. From the very moment that we were greeted all the way to paying the bill was such a lovely experience. The food was delicious I had egg drop soup and chicken fried rice. My party shared egg roles and crab puffs and those were very tasty.  We were celebrating my birthday and the lady was so kind to wish me a happy birthday. At the end of a wonderful dining experience the woman treated me with a surprise creme brulee with a candle. She went above and beyond and I cant wait to go back to the prime. The food is delicious and the people are so kind. Thank you for a great birthday dinner The Prime.,2016-05-27 01:52:50

Johnny Smalls take on small plates is creative, but also tasty. We tried a few different things and were pleased with most of the choices.

The menu is small, but when just 2 people are dining, the menu can be overwhelming since you want to try so many things, but probably only have room for 2-3 each. 

We went for: 
Chicken and waffles: fun take on this dish. the syrup covered waffle fries were tasty.
Guacamole: Okay. Probably better over at Pink Taco, but they were out of the Pretzel Dip we originally wanted. 
Chili Dogs: I do not eat a lot of chili or hot dogs, but they were good.
Grilled PB&J: Really good. Definitely need to eat it with the jam. 

The service was pretty good. Worth another trip back next time I am in town.

I went back here in August and tried a few other items:
""The Finger""-the salt & vinegar chicken tenders are a bit salty, but are pretty crispy and tasty
Cheesecake Pops-They sound much tastier than they really are. We were disappointed in these.
Beer & Cheese Dip-We really liked this. All the flavors work pretty well in this dip. 
Mac & Cheese Flatbread-Pretty filing up enjoyable. The pesto dip gives it some flavor, so probably better if you like pesto.",2010-07-27 17:02:23

We went with a friend before seeing a show at Playhouse Square - so we arrived around 6:30 and were easily in and out for our 8:30 show time.

The hostess asked if we ahead reservations - since we didn't we were seated at a high top in the bar area. Within 30 minutes the main dining space tables were FULL with those who'd reserved in advance.

Our friend had already visited, so we had some insights ... Main insight: Desserts are small (we passed, but did see some and they are petite sized).

The biscuits with butter and preserves were a nice WELCOME - and rather than losing the bottom half of mine to my husband, our server brought more when she saw my biscuit dodging his grasping hand. 

I had the chicken & waffles - a dish that is different everywhere you go. Our friend was afraid the portion was too small - I assured him that the waffles & coating were so rich, the portion size was perfect. It was crispy outside, with wonderful dense flavors. For some people, the sweet potato waffle might seem dry, but it's a savory accompaniment to the chicken, and is great with the warm bourbon maple syrup.

Our friend said the shrimp & grits were divine and my husband really enjoyed the catfish po'boy. He loves a good BBQ potato chip, so he really liked the crunchy chips at SoHo.

From where we we seated, I had a great view of the electric atmosphere in the dining room - a great mix of patrons enjoying a night out. I also watched the bar tender carefully crafting drink after drink. I'll be back and try out some of their signature cocktails. If they reflect his attention to the details, they should be fabulous!

The only gripe I have is that the shape of the serving plates makes it impossible to rest a knife on the 'side' of your plate. Not sure where I'm supposed to put it between uses. 

I'll deal with random utensil management issues since SoHo will definitely be part of our dining rotation in Ohio City.",2011-12-19 05:09:23

Jason's Deli was good. I'd definitely go again. I had a half ham & swiss on french bread and a cup of their cheddar broccoli soup. Yummy. They also have a huge salad bar that I'd like to try out on my next visit.

There were a couple of people already ahead of us in line.  It's a bit overwhelming, lots of soup, salads, and sandwiches to choose from.  You can sample the soups, which was cool.  My favorites were the gumbo and clam chowder, I'll order one of those next time we eat here.  For lunch, I had the bacon turkey and honey mustard sandwich with the BBQ chicken salad.  The sandwich was pretty average, I could have easily made it at home.  White bread with a bit of turkey and decent honey mustard smashed with a Panini press.  I was not impressed and won't order this again, don't know why I talked myself out of the pulled pork.

The salad was a good portion for the price, the chicken had no flavor, but the BBQ sauce was good.  I could have used more, also more onions.  No heat on this salad, I'll try to see if they have jalapenos or something next time.  Salads come with bread, which was no good, and a chocolate covered strawberry, which was fantastic.  It was a very good quality strawberry, juicy and deep red  color.  

The wife had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup with the red pepper Caesar salad.  I liked the salad, but it needed a little more dressing.  It was dry, but too much dressing would have drowned it.  The soup was very surprising, I am not a cauliflower person so I was not expecting to like it.  But, it's basically a cheese soup.  Yet another example that soups and stews are great places to hide veggies.  It was thick and hearty, a definite repeat.

Let's talk wine. They do have a pretty decently constructed wine list that represents most parts of the globe (though it did feel a little California heavy on my visit, not that there's anything wrong with Cali wines). I ordered a glass of a slightly obscure cabernet that I had not had before (since I like to try new things), and it was meh. The server really couldn't tell me anything about it before hand, but we'll get to the service in a minute.  First, let's talk about price.  Given that I work in the wine industry, I'm aware of the customary markups. But this list seemed a little on the pricey side, compared to what I'm used to. Could be that I'm a cheap date, or maybe it's the uptown atmosphere.

Which leads me back to the service. Aside from no one in the room really being able to talk intelligently about the wines I was considering when I asked,other than offering scant more than what the menu stated, we were met with a coldness from the staff that honestly made me a little uncomfortable.  I felt my presence was an inconvenience to them. Maybe it's a byproduct of serving mostly Center City banker-types and they are giving their usual crowd what they expect, but at the least a smile never killed anyone.

The problem is that their plants suck. For a nursery, their plants really suck. Dead, dying, and bug-molested stock sits around like it ain't no thang, and for most of their plants it's more a matter of picking something that doesn't look completely hopeless and ugly than it is something that looks good.

It's completely crazy to sit here going ""Yeah, SummerWinds is an awesome nursery unless you actually want plants."" They've often got more variety than the big boxes do, they have a surprising selection of organic transplants (albeit with the same problems), and their prices are great... but it feels like going to the glue factory to find a derby winner.

To their credit, SummerWinds does carry some higher-end stock like young trees and Monrovia-brand plants, which are (unsurprisingly) clearly very carefully cared for.

With take out they give you a bottle of water which I feel is a nice touch for over the top customer service. Something almost all restaurants charge extra for.

Went back last week for lunch with a friend. This is the first time I've had lunch at Thai Delight. My friend had the Massaman Curry with chicken and I had Garlic and Pepper with chicken sliced (lunch menu shows ground chicken). My friend seems to enjoy her food by not saying much but her plate will be clean when finished. Lol  So I'm assuming she liked it. I loved my dish so much that I will order it again. It had lots of veggies, which I'm always looking for. A lot of places will only put the standard fare of carrots, peppers and onions. Whatever they put in the broth is divine! I think it's a hint of ginger. The pepper in the name comes from black pepper (I think). Even tho it's a lunch portion I took about half home (I'm not a light eater).

With lunch they had a soup and salad bar. The salad choices are limited so don't come expecting to fill up on it. Not sure if the soup changes, that day it was egg drop soup. I added greens onions to it from the salad bar. A spring roll accompanied our entree as well.

Best Buy doesn't have commissioned employees and their returns are straight forward. FS on the other hand has people hovering around in some sections (I guess due to high margin in those departments) while some sections are left at their own mercy and one has to chase someone to get service. 
I was looking to get a new laptop as my current one is on its last legs. FS had a model that met my requirements. Guess what I couldn't find anyone to help me out. There were tons of laptops on display but quite a few of them were missing labels and tags so one couldn't tell what model they were and what are the specs. 
I managed to pull up some specs from their website on my phone and finally flagged someone to help me out. Initially the sales person was adamant that they don't have laptop at that price with those specs. Seriously not according to your website.

Their fried cheese curds are served with the tasty Bombers sauce and you've eaten them all before you even realize it.

While the food is *amazing* the real draw to AJ Bombers for me is the atmosphere. Because I talk to the staff all the time over twitter (@ajbombers and @ajbombersmsn), it's great to be greeted as a friend walking in the door. Bombers is heavy into social - you can get deals through checking in on Foursquare and even have the bartender send you a p-nut bomb (it's just what it sounds like - a metal container that slides along the ceiling - filled with peanuts - that refills your table's peanut bowl when it hits the target above your table!) by asking for it over Twitter.

We were horrified to be informed that lunch was only served after 12 pm, since nothing on the brunch menu really appealed to us. Luckily, the kitchen obliged to serve us items from the lunch menu, so we're pretty happy about the service.

Sides are mostly ordered à la carte here, so we got a whole bunch of them to supplement our meal. First up, deep fried pickles, served with zesty scallion mayonnaise. Unfortunately, the batter didn't really adhere to the pickles and fell off really easily, so this was a difficult snack to maneuver. The mayo dip was also a little runny for my liking.

Next came the Harlem cornbread, which was an absolute delight! Mildly sweet, dense and moist, the cornbread was perfect with the salted butter. I loved the savoury and sweet combination, and the salt in the butter really brought out that innate sweetness in the cornbread. 

I've read many positive reviews on Harlem's mac-n-cheese, but this one didn't exactly live up to my expectations. In fact, it tasted like Kraft dinner.  By the time I was having my second spoonful, I already felt like I was in a food coma.

And the winner of the day goes to...the Harlem: A grilled three layer sammy of black forest ham, jerk chicken salad, avocado, mango mayo and jalapeño Havarti on a challah toast. When this sandwich arrived, I almost gasped in awe- the portion was huge! I'd seen a picture of this sandwich on Harlem's website, and that sandwich looked a lot tinier than this one. I loved the combination of the different textures and flavours of each ingredient. The avocado (my favourite) added a perfect layer of creaminess to this delectable concoction. The best part? The sandwich came with sweet potato fries, which I love, love, love! The intense, sweet flavour of the yam really shone through the fries. 

We left extremely full and satisfied, and I even felt slightly dizzy from all that deep fried goodness! I'll definitely be coming back again for their famous fried chicken!",2011-04-06 19:06:37

Featured are artists like Hans Olson, Walt Richardson, Gin Blossoms, The Refreshments, etc. There's even a life size evil-looking mannequin of a St. Madness member that I saw a number of rugrats run up to and then run screaming away from. LOL. There was also a synthetic drum set up so you can put on headphones and pound away to your heart's content - which was probably the most popular part of the exhibit with the kids. Afterwards I took a quick look at the regular exhibits. There are a few interactive things you can do on a computer like take a photo of yourself and turn it into a mosaic made from photos of all the folks that did the same thing before you. There's also a virtual ""Greetings From Tempe"" postcard you can make with your photo and send it to yourself by email. Also going on at the same time was a lego exhibition by Cactus Brick featuring a giant train set, giant castle, and pretty much every space vehicle in the Star Wars series. Right at the entrance there's all sorts of stuff for sale mostly related to either Tempe or the museum exhibits. That day we went there was also a concert event called LOUD IV - featuring the Salt River Brass Quartet, The Stu Siefer Combo, and Bad Cactus Brass Band. There were also a few food trucks: Bang Bang Dumplings, Sweet Magnolias Smokehouse BBQ and Paletas Betty. Didn't try the other trucks but I just HAD to have a Strawberry Cream paleta. Salt River Brass Quartet played first and played a wide range of material - jazz, classical and even pop pieces like their rendition of Pharrell Williams' ""Happy"" as well as Muse's ""Supermassive Black Hole."" Stu Siefer's Combo played more straight ahead traditional jazz standards. We didn't stay past that but a good time was had by all. I'll definitely come back for another event like this.

My first lunch at Pisces was a on saturday (no ayce deal) and even though we didn't see any booths we accepted the hostess' offer to sit in one. She took us into the almost empty restaurant and down a hallway to the right, and voila! booths with cute fishbowl shaped privacy cut outs. (or fine, just circles, but we liked the idea of fishbowls) we ordered four different rolls, and they were all decent, though we each clearly had a least favorite (my brain and taste buds had a hard time deciding if tomatoes should be on sushi). The service was attentive, and we enjoyed our meal even though we could hear every word of the conversation a few booths overs. 

My second lunch fell on a weekday, and the ayce special. (You order off an abridged menu, it's not a buffet) I was a little hesitant since they go out of their way to say they'll charge you for waste (especially leftover rice on your plate) and really, it seems a little unnecessary. But, we did learn that the orders are half rolls, so if you choose a spicy tuna and a cucumber roll, you'll get four pieces of each instead of a full eight pieces of each. We ended up just ordering off the regular menu but plenty of people around us were loving the special.

Even though I've tried a roll in every price range (they're nicely listed in increasing prices on the menu), nothing really sets Pisces apart. Yes, the spicy tuna roll is good, but it doesn't stand out against another spicy tuna in town. They do have some nice flavor combos (though I haven't really delved into the ones with cream cheese, not my favorite sushi ingredient), eating at Pisces again would be more out of convenience since it's minutes from my house than going for a specific roll.

Had a somewhat difficult time getting there, its on a one way street, we parked at the garage underneath the location. Thankfully they validated parking. Inside is decorated like TGI Fridays, looks very casual dining to me, but the prices don't reflect the casual atmosphere. 

He ordered the Thursday special which was fried chicken and biscuit. He seemed to like it although he didn't eat it all, he ate all the coleslaw but there was half a chicken breast and a chicken leg leftover as well as half the biscuit. I personally didn't love the honey drizzled over the lightly battered chicken skin. I guess that's an acquired taste.

I had the filet mignon which for $36 should not have been dry like it was . I did order it medium well, but that usually leaves me with a little moistness. Despite being dry it was very tasty. I liked the potatoes and creamed spinach that came with it. I absolutely loved the cocktail that I ordered called Butchers Blood and Sand. The waitress asked me what kind of drinks I usually like and I told her that lately I've been drinking Manhattans. She said I would probably like this drink and she was correct.

It includes pigs nosed scotch, cherry heering, Carpano Antica, orange juice, clove and orange bitters. 

We had no room in our belly for dessert. 

My server was very good about checking up on us and making sure we enjoyed our dinner. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 maybe cause I was looking for something a little more formal and partly because my meat was dry.

Seriously, once I laid my hungry eyes upon your layers of bacon, melted cheddar cheese, and drizzled garlic mayo and cilantro herb seasoning, I knew my plans for a healthy diet would not last (at least for that day).   

I first had these fries when my coworkers ordered for delivery.  The following week I ventured to get some of them on my own.  It turned out to be a little section within a bar/pub.  It's more of a delivery or take out place for this reason unless you want to sit at the one tiny table in the corner of the pub.  Oddly, there's also a $1 take-out fee.

Since then, I've actually ordered from Johnny Vegas Grill multiple times while at work for all my co-workers.  We've tried so much from their menu and the majority have been a huge hit with the staff here at Desert Springs Hospital.  

Some things I'd suggest to try out:  Pizza quesadillas, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers w/ cream cheese filling, Italian philly, delicious fish tacos (spicy), and of course their Johnny Vegas Fries.  

They also sell candy like Caramel Apple Pops and Twix here!

Their food is exceptionally good and they truly appreciate their customers.  The last time we ordered from them they threw in a free slice of cheesecake with a personalized 'thank you' message.   It was delicious and now is also on our must order list.   JVG has become our #1 go to spot for late night food delivery and we'll be ordering from them time and time again.

You're right, it has that Guu vibe, but this place is MUCH QUIETER and I appreciate that very much! We came in at 12:15pm on a Friday and people started pouring in right after. So glad I made the reservations! Lunch service is from 12pm-3pm only.

I noticed most people ordered their lunch specials! Good deal, generous portion and comes with house salad :) On the side, we also ordered a lot of mini a la carte dishes - GREAT for sharing! For 4 people, we ordered enough to fill us up, bill came up to less than $100 after taxes and tips (yay!)

Some items stood out more than others, here are my fave!

1. Curry rice with minced beef & veg topped with poached egg
- not spicy, love the aroma from japanese curry, large lunch portion!
2. BBQ Pork Belly with spicy sauce
- not spicy at all, but melts-in-your-mouth good :D
3. Torched Vinegar Marinated Mackerel
- #love... topped with fresh sweet puréed radish, green onions and ginger!
4. Deep fried Chicken Knuckle Bones
- #crunch... looks like popcorn chicken XD very tasty.

Final note: I'm definitely coming back. I really enjoyed the food and service. Food flew out the kitchen (except the Octopus Balls, which came LAST... strange *scratches head*) and waitresses all have great smiles :D At the end of the meal, my dad took their business card and saw that the chef was actually named Ju, hence, Izakaya Ju.

Service was slow but it was late and we had drinks and a group so it wasn't an issue so much. Food was meh.

Then I go in for lunch today, same waitress. I think ""oh great, this should be an adventure"" -- boy was I right. Took over an hour for 2 lunch portions and an appetizer for our table. Nothing complex, either (2 fish and chips and a baked artichoke). It seemed that the waitress had no concept of time -- likely because she was standing at the bar just inside talking to her coworkers while we burned up on the patio waiting for food. She also failed to bring out condiments we asked for -- I would have reminded her, but the next time we saw her, she was bringing the checks.

I may not have cared so much if I wasn't on a lunch break, but when it's business lunch hour, you'd think the waitstaff would try to acknowledge that. $20 for lunch with slow service and average food is never worth it.

My wife got that massive veggie and egg plate that they showed on MvF (I can't recall what it was). Both were acceptable, but underwhelming. My wife makes better pancakes and eggs, and the plate she ordered tasted under-seasoned. 

It wasn't terribly expensive so I didn't feel that it was a total waste, but surely didn't think it was worthy of its claim of ""Best Breakfast in Pittsburg"". I also felt that the inconvenience of cash-only would make it not worth a return visit.

We arrived at 5:45pm on a Thursday expecting a wait, but we actually were seated quickly - score one.   The server came over quickly - score 2.   It went downhill from there.  

I ordered the Crab BLT which was deliciously described on the menu and I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into it.  The food arrived in a decent amount of time and presentation was great.   I took my first bite expecting magic and came away with a bready, bland mush with crunchy burnt bacon.   The actual crab cake had absolutely NO flavor - nothing, zilch, thankfully the sauce on the bun added a bit, but not enough to save the dish.  The bun was just this side of being stale and did I mention the burnt bacon.  Now, I love and must have crunchy bacon, but the majority of the bacon on my plate was inedible.    I was very sad.

My son had a burger and he said it was ""ok""  nothing to write home about and the fries - which everyone said were amazing were just ""ok"" too.

Husband had the pork sandwich and while the sauce was good - I can't imagine the sandwich was great - he typically is the first finished and it appeared he was forcing himself to even finish it.

- loved some of the small touches. The menus we nicely bound in cork imprinted leather, the nod to Canadian wines & local produce, the truffles to end the meal were off the hook

Cons:

Price wise, it's a little bit on the expensive side compared to other downtown Toronto sushi joints ($15-20/lunch). But they do make quite an effort to plate the food to make it look extra fancy. Taste wise, it's not better or worse than your average sushi place but hey, you get to take fancy shots for your instagram lol!",2016-12-14 19:03:33

I remember this restaurant because the food was amazing! The server was extremely helpful with what he recommended, because I ordered exactly both recommendations for the appetizer and entree.

tt7ZCce-ArJWMaO4ubLI4Q,zRMYkKuolr9hgaYixFm1NA,PD3ganU8NAGkqkcIXYPSxQ,4,14,1,7,"This noodle place offers ""crossing the bridge noodles"".  This dish (noodle itself is just rice noodle) is from Yun Nan Province in southern China. 

The dish has 3 components.  First, a large bowl of BOILING soup (you have 7 choices of soup). Second, a bowl of cooked rice noodle (no flavour). Third, a tray of small plates of ingredients (raw vegetables, raw pork slice, mushroom, seaweed) that are ready to be added into the boiling soup.

How to eat this? Put small plate of ingredients into boiling soup. Raw meat and mushroom go first. And then raw vegetables, fish cake, corn, etc. At last, add the rice noodle. Wait about 30 seconds, once raw meat is fully cooked, you can indulge the dish!

This dish is very simple. What makes one stands out is the SOUP! And I have to say this place has the best soup/broth! There are another two similar noodle places in Chinatown that also specialize in crossing-the-bridge-noodle, and a number of them in uptown, this is one of the best I have had among all.

Tips: don't expect to finish the dish in 10 mins, because the soup is sooo hot. Also did I mention they offer unlimited noodle and soup refill?",2017-09-15 04:07:56

Ribeye was sold out (couple hrs before they closed on a Monday night), so I got the NY strip steak.  The seasoning and the sear on the steak were just right, cooked to medium rare, and served with a circle comprised of 3 sauces.  One of the sauces had a little kick but lended a complexity to the flavor.  It was unlike any steak I've ever had before.  If you want a steak but possibly something different, I would highly recommend this place.  I could tasty salty and spicy among other things.

NY strip steak = 5/5
Shrimp & corn tamale appetizer = 5/5 (big enough to share w/ a friend)

Hello Sin City PC...I had an awesome experience with these people.  They took my computer and told me what they thought was wrong with it and the price it would be to fix it.

Having been fortunate enough to assemble the first Chefseries event at Naked City Pizza on Paradise, and subsequently attending a brunch where Chef Christopher Palmeri further showed off some of the concepts planned for Naked City Tavern, it was with four restaurant savvy friends from near and far that Brunch was enjoyed at 6295 South Pecos Road in the old Blind Tiger Bar & Grill, the interior as yet largely unchanged from the previous resident while the food is already quite great.

No doubt a man whose talents are critically underrated by local ""experts"" who have long overlooked Palmeri's hard work, dedication and creativity that has transformed Moondoggies into an Off-Strip destination and continued to develop at Naked City Pizza on Paradise, Naked City Tavern is the young Chef's first foray into 24/7 dining and with menus slowly being released during the current soft opening all signs seem to indicate that Off-Strip all-hours dining is about to evolve in a direction never seen before.

Recently showered in deserved praise by one local writer, Christopher and brother Michael's story earning them the cover of one of Las Vegas' weekly Mags, a quick look at Naked City Tavern shows high likelihood for being a great place to watch sports while enjoying a beer or partaking in some Video Poker, and with a mixed crowd including some rough-looking locals as well as a whole troop of motorcyclists present as early as 11am there already seems to be a buzz brewing, the All-Night and Morning menu just one week into its debut.

Known already for Wings, Fries, Pies, Meatballs and more, those options available at all times, Naked City Tavern's 10p-11a Menu offers a concise dozen-or-so additions and kicking off with the now well-known ""Bacon Candle"" those familiar were once again impressed by the inspired riff on Oil and Vinegar's evolving flavors while those experiencing it for the first time equally reveled at the concept, the novelty not lost on even those who've traveled far and wide.

Tossing in a few items from the upcoming Dinner menu, the Crudo Combo a beautiful rendition with Fennel Pollen and Pickled Blueberries particularly well placed in juxtaposition to the Chiles and preserved Truffles, Palmeri admits that the ""Foie-co"" may have come about in the setting of a bit of drinking, the city of Las Vegas in that case once again benefitting from the results of inebriation as crispy duck confit finds itself paired with slices of Duck Liver in an umami-rich union beneath smooth Uni Cream.

Never one to take the path of least resistance, his hand-shaken butter just one example along with house-smoked Bacon, handmade Maple Sausage and crackling Chicharrons, previously seen items from the Overnight Menu included the textbook Risotto that outperforms many Casino-based fine-dining establishments for just $11 as well as the Italian-riff on a Croque Madame entiled ""Hot mama"" that features Ham, Salami and Provolone stacked on Brioche beneath Alfredo and a runny Egg, a dish that almost seems too rich for one person, as too does the glazed Porchetta stuffed with the aforementioned Sausage that some felt was a touch too sugary, but none denied was texturally on-point.

Never particularly a fan of Chilaquiles, a predilection for sweeter breakfasts no doubt involved, Palmeri's version at Naked City Tavern is offered either Sunny Side or Scrambled, the Avocado crema and fresh Sprouts plus Radish adding levity atop Tortillas that stand up to the weight of their toppings, much as the springy Brioche dredged in custard does to a slathering of Nutella along with housemade preserves of Blackberries.

Admitting that he is not particularly one to indulge in sweets when showing me the menu a couple months back, but agreeing that a Breakfast menu would not be complete without some items in that vein, Chef Palmeri could not help but take the road less traveled when coming up with his Pancakes, completely eschewing the buttermilk flapjacks served at every other 24/7 space and instead presenting a Dutch Baby that comes across almost savory thanks to the use of Vanilla Cream and more of the Huckleberries, one of the soon-to-be-launched desserts showing a similar sort of restraint by offering Chocolate Gelato from Art of Flavors along with Cherry and Chocolate sauce plus light Mint accents that come across subtly.",2016-07-31 19:57:33

I believe today was their first day of their soft opening so I won't talk about service mistakes but only the food and experience. 

It is an udon place and the entry with the Japanese authentic plastic food samples makes it seem really authentic to me. As you enter, you go to the right and order cafeteria style. It is a new concept to me which seems to be becoming more popular, but it really works for this place. When you pick up your tray, you can watch the food being made or look at the menu while you wait in line. When you get to the front, you tell the chefs what number you want and they prepare your bowl quickly right in front of you. You then pass through a bar where you can grab additional side items like various types of tempura and onigiri. Then pay and sit down. They have a pretty awesome self serve tea bar as well. 

The udon and food itself was very good. I am aware they brought in chefs from Japan to train and I do feel as if they delivered. The portion of udon itself does not look like much but it was very filling. The udon I ordered is not your standard soup broth kind, but you pour the sauce over your noodles and slurp away. I loved the strong soy and bonito flavor of the one I ordered (#4). And the texture and consistency of the noodles was perfect. I think the tempuras could be a little less greasy but they were also very good. 

My only suggestion at this point is for them to put explanations of each dish on their menu so we know what we are ordering!",2017-11-14 21:02:22

This is probably our favorite happy hour in PV, but recently we had a business dinner after and the portions were embarrassingly small.  Their 'family style portions' are really only enough for one person.

AXRVixkCqq-LBPmZOx9QjA,oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,NMFWunCA1_7-_UoiExtoTA,4,4,0,1,"I made reservations in advance for a party of 5 and I am glad I did because this place was pretty busy on a Saturday at 1pm. The tea parlor is located around the Burton square in a beautiful green Victorian mansion. Inside is just as lovely with its decor and you can tell there is a lot of attention paid to detail. 

We all got our own little pot of tea, some dined on finger sandwiches with a cup of soup, others had crust less quiche with a side salad, and most of us tried the scones of the day with cream and jam. Here are my details:

*Savory Sampler $12.95 - You get a choice of soup or salad and the soup comes out in a small clear tea cup. I had tomato bisque and it was pretty good. For the main bit you get four finger sandwiches with some fruit. It's a light meal so don't expect to leave full unless you order something else to go along with it. 
*Scones and Cream $4.95 - Two small scones with devonshire cream and jam. A-okay. 
*Pot of Tea $4.95 - I got the raspberry tea and had no complaints. 

I think we all enjoyed our elegant little meals, and of course the pleasant company of each other. With tax and 20% gratuity automatically added, my bill was just shy of $30. So not a cheap experience, but fancy tea time with friends is still a lovely time especially if you dress up and wear hats. 

However, while good, I would not rate this place five stars though. Half a dozen things we requested they were out of which started to move past disappointing and into tiresome. Also, while our server was polite, he was not fully on top of his game. He had to go back to the kitchen a couple of times to find out what was in things like the crepe of the day, or what else they were out of, and he never brought out our sides so we sat for a really long time waiting with just tea when we should have been enjoying soup and salad before the entrée arrived. I will say that it was nice of one of the owners, Annette, to stop by and see how we were doing. 

If you live around the Burton area or if you don't mind a long car ride, I recommend checking this tea parlor out. A cute place for a little girl's birthday party, some father daughter time, or just a ladies lunch. Be prepared to spend a couple hours here and don't come hungry. Maybe making a day out of your visit to Burton and checking out other attractions in the area would make the longer trip here even more worthwhile (it was an hour drive for me from Rocky River).",2018-01-29 20:32:49

I've been in here a few times, but never when it's busy. The prices don't impress me, but I'd say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. 

One thing I'd like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If you're a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If you're a smart shopper, you'll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If you're getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably don't care.

The decor is red. It's very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. It's also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. 

With the patio door open, you're going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if you're sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. 

It's a nice bar, but I don't know that I'd single it out as a ""place to be."" I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but that's based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels I'd suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because it's conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.",2008-10-21 05:00:48

The atmosphere was exciting and family friendly.  I quickly became friends with everyone seated around me and almost everyone was a relative or had a connection to one of the players and were encouraging them the whole game.  It was a blast talking to everyone.  The pep band was great and the cheerleaders and dance team helped rile up the crowd. 
The concession stand had limited options but the prices were cheaper than most.  My friend said her soft pretzel was one of the worst she's ever had though.  I liked my chicago dog but the ""homemade chips"" that came with it were pretty bad.  They sell beer.  That's a plus.

As I arrived to park, there were both Phx PD and Celebrity staff directing traffic/parking, which was nice and efficient. But, it was $5 to park (lame) and the system after the show felt ""messy"" and ""unorganized"".

The venue itself is older (it seems) and cld use a great face-lift/refurb. It even smelled old and musty. The seating is in a large circle around the main, center stage. It seemed to be a little strange having a comic stand-up as they had to keep turning to address everyone.

""Sure.. wait what??""

Yea, Tommy Bahama's is not just a clothing store, they serve Hawaiian type food.  My friend ordered stuff to go for us since she had a visitor at her house:

Loki-Loki Tuna Poke: Tuna w/ capers soy and sesame oil served with guacamole and 6 strips of chips.  It was ok.  Good filler but not worth $16.50. 

Little Cayman Lollipops: 6 drumettes grilled, smoked with a mango BBQ sauce glazed. Comes with a dipping sauce, but i had no idea what it was.  Very tasty treats.  My tongue was very please to meet these bad boys, but for $9.50 per an order.. Eek! 

Saba Steak Salad: Marinated, char-grilled tenderloin medallions, grilled potatoes, roman tomatoes, shiitake chips, garlic aioli & tamarind vinaigrette.  Steak was really tender and satisfying.  The vinaigrette was quite addicting too.

My buddy ate two salad, Tahitian Tuna Salad ($17.50 )and I think the St. Croix Salad ($16.50).  It still amazed me how much this tiny girl can eat.  She was pretty quiet the whole time munching on her greens, so i guess that's a good thing. 

Overall I was very astonished that the food came out positive for the most part, but it's just a little controversial since the price was a bit steep.  Service was wonderful though.  We ordered to go from the bartender and she was very easy going and helpful.

Even during lunch, just pay $2 more and you get a plethora of dinner options as seen in my photos which include a sashimi roll which is practically rolls using sashimi as the wrap, screaming O salad, and my absolute favorite here: the towering poke stack.  

Sakana offers a great amount of appetizers which vary and include fried rice, pork belly, gyoza, shrimp tempura, also something called ""the shit""  which was just okay. 

The fact that they are AYCE does not sacrifice the quality of the sushi here.  Super fresh, super delicious.  Still way cheaper than any other ayce in Vegas.

On their dinner specials this time around: ""Sy's Special and Dragon's Special"" .  These referred to the two sushi chef's who each made unique dishes.     I tried the Dragon special and out came salmon belly nigiri plated next to a sushi 'ball' wrapped in avocado and sushi.  Hard to describe but delicious, just check out my picture of this.

Later during the dinner, SY offered his special to us.  He asked me to try it and since I didn't technically order it, they said if I didn't finish it, it wouldn't count against us.  (Since you're supposed to finish everything you order).  A whole different sushi preparation compared to Dragon's and picture must be seen below.  Of course, like the Dinner Special board had written down ""Don't ask, just try!""  that is exactly what I did.  It was pretty good, dragon's was better imo.


The only 1 reason I took down a star this time around:  I ordered 1 piece of Uni which is a dinner only item.  They ran out!   Now, If I came late to dinner that would be fine, but we were the first customers there for dinner.   I guess being able to have the ""dinner"" menu during lunch time is a double-edged sword.  It's great, because I would come during lunch and do dinner, but I believe you should save some uni for your real dinner time customers.

I have tried their uni in the past times I've ate here, and it was fresh.  Creamy and tasty.

The service is always nice here.  The location is right on the corner behind the Target.  They finally have their Sakana sign up after having the old Kabuto sign which they replaced.

Service:

We've never once felt unwelcome. The service has been fantastic every time. The various wait staff is always courteous, always professional, and always casual enough where we feel comfortable. Customer service can make or break an experience, and here it's great.

Appetizers:

The falafel is delicious. It's well prepared and never overdone. Their kubbeh is also great -- its basically a minced meat ball with various spices, in a bulgur shell. They also have plates of hummus and baba ghannouj that are flavourful and pair well with fresh pita. We recently tried their more Canadian appetizers like their ""spicy garlic fries"" and were only mildly impressed -- it's basically fries with garlic paste, tossed in Frank's Hot Sauce. The sauce and paste just makes the fries soggy, and the flavour is just like covering fries in Frank's..... stick with the middle eastern appetizers!

Main courses:

Wraps....
If you have a smaller appetite, their wraps are great. My mom usually gets just a wrap as she's a small eater. The chicken and beef shawarma wraps are both good on their own, although most of the time, anyone who gets a wrap goes ""mixed"" which is both meats -- but PLEASE remember to specify what you don't want in it, or else it will have everything, including tahina, hot sauce, onions, etc -- and they generally don't ask you. They just assume you want it all, unless you say.

I recently tried the sujok wrap (having had sujok at several other places) and was quite impressed. Not just is it a lot cheaper than the other wraps, but I found it equally satisfying both in terms of taste and quantity. Sujok is a middle eastern spicy sausage (sometimes part of breakfast) that is very salty. It's also plenty delicious.

Dinners...
If you have a larger appetite, their full dinners are DELICIOUS. Everyone else in my family usually gets a dinner, and it's enough to fill a very hungry person, or as 2 meals for most people. Again we always get ""mixed"" shawarma dinners which will come with plenty of beef and chicken, which is tender and spiced just right. The salad is tasty, the rice is great, and the portion is plenty filling. The large amount of garlic paste and hummus on your plate is also worth noting! YUM!!

SAUCE!
Now for the best part: remember to ask for bottles of tahina (pronounced tahini in north america), and also hot sauce if you like that. It's not the traditional ""thick"" tahina you may get some places (it's more of a watered-down liquid, in a squeeze bottle) but it's still very tasty and in unlimited supply -- a group of 6 of us go through SEVERAL bottles of it when we're there, putting it on everything -- the appetizers, the meat, the rice, everything. We often ask for extra bottles so that no one has to wait. It enhances the taste tremendously, and enhances our entire experience.

They will give you tons of fresh pita with every course -- just keep asking for more if you run out. Not just do you get the experience of a plate of food, but you can have fun with it. Put some meat in your pita, throw some garlic/hummus in there, some rice if you want, then cover it all in sauce: make your OWN wraps!

From our experience, there's always plenty of seating unless it's a holiday of some sort. In those cases (or if you're a large party), make a reservation. Otherwise, we've just walked in.

Overall, we love this place and will continue to go back. The price is decent I guess -- $12.99 per dinner and about $5 for each appetizer. With drinks / tax / tip, expect it to be about $20 per person.

Whether you eat there or take it to go, you'll be satisfied. We just prefer to eat in because of the unlimited tahina!",2013-07-26 17:32:39

It's a cute restaurant. Definitely a more classy environment than what I expected. But for a Southern restaurant, I kind of expect....more of it to be really Southern.

I liked the food, no doubt. But the portions were small.... not typical of Southern food. On to the food....

We came here on Sunday for brunch. It was cute in the beginning- they give you these small little butter biscuits to munch on...but man, they were small. And not replenished.

I ordered the benedict, per the waiter's opinion. I mean, the sauce was good, and it was good..just the ham was way too salty. Like crazy salty. My friends ordered the skillet (which looked the most worth its price) and the biscuits and gravy.

I mean, the decor is cool and inviting. And hip. But the food..iono, I've been to the South and to Southern restaurants...and I feel that Soho is slightly false advertisement of what Soho means.

The portions are amazing, be prepared for a take some home.  

Even though I gave it 5 stars there are some drawbacks.  The place is cash only.  It drafty when the door opens, which can be uncomfortable if you are seated by the door and its cold outside.  Parking in the area sucks, and it is extremely loud when the place is busy.

I spent a lot of money there because they take the time to deal with my indecisiveness in dropping $3k. I had other options and I was shopping around including online but my decision came down to them. They're local, they ride the trails I ride, they're extremely experienced and knowledgable and seem to give a shit with my hundreds of questions I had in 26 vs 29, brain vs no brain, chassis geometry, this rear set with that shifter etc... like endless knowledge of everything they stock and more.

It came down to ordering a brand new 2011 or taking the last 2010 upper model in the shop. After some talking I walked out with the more upgraded 2010 model. I got a great price, had it in-hands and didn't have to wait the 4+ months to get the new one and I was stoked.

Recently I brought her in for routine maintenance, left it there after my ride on a sunday and was back in hands tuesday afternoon. It went in dirty and grimy - came out like a million bucks :) Like seriously as clean as the day I bought it...

I had never seen the inside of one of their guest rooms prior to the remodeling and renovations, so I can't do a comparison, but I certainly liked the ""new"" rooms.  Everything from the bed, mattress, linen, TV set (flat panel that gets DirecTV), bathroom, sink, tile, carpet, tables, chairs, drapes, and wall art all looked brand new.  I was very comfortable during my stay.  

The ice machines on the floors were inoperable, so I had to trudge downstairs to the bar to get ice in the bucket, but it wasn't too much of a hassle.  There are no coffee machines or irons in the rooms either, but I'm certainly not complaining for only $23 per night.  It was well worth that, and more.  Plus there are no ""mandatory"" resort fees or other nonsense rip-offs like that at the Plaza.  You pay for the cost of the room and applicable tax and that's it.

The casino has a completely new look as well.  There are many more table games and banks of slot machines than before.  All of the staff I encountered were friendly and glad to help if you had a question or needed something.  Gigi's cupcakes were awesome. Hash House looked very inviting, but I had a terrible experience before at the one at Imperial Palace and won't ever go into one them again.  There are still some renovations taking place too.

First off, Shannon is right. I don't think I will ever be able to call this Spectrum Mall. I grew up a few blocks away and the entire duration of my childhood it was called Chris Town, so Chris Town it will stay. 

If I were rating Chris Town of 1992, It would probably be a four or even five star establishment. I think its hey day happened just after the food court was finished, then it was downhill from there. 

I will stipulate, however, that there are a couple of a redeeming qualities that remain. Ok, just one. The Costco inside is very convenient and might carry a slightly different selection compared with some of the other Costco's around. 

The movie theaters used to be great but just aren't anymore.

What's the same is the menu and whether it's dinner or lunch the menu and the wide variety that comes with it has the same prices too which is 5 bucks for menu items with the availability for a variety of add ons.

Now while the Queen and McCaul location is further away from U of T the vibe is very much the same because Queen W is just cool that way.  It's not the Annex, this hood has it's own thing going on.  

It can be quite loud inside.  The music or music videos, busyness and all around ambiance it's an eclectic crowd just like their music playing.  The two people I had lunch with had not heard of either the Warehouse or El Furniture but when I mentioned that we could have lunch for 5 bucks and that the food wasn't all bad they were all in.

To start all 3 of us had a starter, two of which were wings (one was dry salt and pepper and the other hot sauced) and the other was a basket of onion rings.  I mean the wings were small and there were about 8 for each.  For 5 bucks the wings is one of the smaller items you could probably order but hey wings are wings and they're good if you like that sort of thing.

The onion rings came with a side of what was referred to as Macho sauce.  It looked like a chipotle type dip not uncommonly seen as a side to onion rings.  The rings were thick cut and nicely battered and freshly made as they were steaming at first bite.

Each of us ordered the Works burger which is essentially a bacon cheese burger which includes a side of fries as well for the same price (5 bucks).  I mean it's not the most fascinating burger you'll ever have in your life but for a sit down place in the city 5 bucks is not a bad deal whatsoever.

The prices for pints are not outrageous either so considering I had two west coast IPA beers and two menu items after tax it came out to 27 bucks.  

Besides the affordable menu there's more to this place and why they have lineups down the street sometimes.  The place is simply fun and it won't cost you very much to enjoy it.

The service was better than good and the atmosphere is just plain cool.",2017-02-16 16:27:17
5Xr930kDCp7zyU82FM-1PA,orh0HRUNCWuQMt9Iia_osg,BOj4HEDS03hxNmXDyE86UQ,4,1,0,0,"Made a reservation for five. Nice to see that they put a sign on our table and actually sectioned it off as being reserved. Had the pork and sprouts congbul, the beef shabu shabu, and the haemul pajeon (seafood pancake). 

The shabu shabu was very much about the purest flavor of the ingredients. There was scant other seasoning going on. The beef from the shabu shabu had next to no marbling, so that was disappointing, and when it cooked down, each piece of beef was quite small, so if you're insistent upon getting the shabu shabu, you might want to think about how much meat you're getting, and if you're into beef, order a few extra orders of it. That being said, I thought it was cool how you get noodles to put in your broth after you've cooked everything in it, and then after the noodles, you get a rice and seasoning put into your broth and it turns into congee/rice porridge. Waste not, want not. The congee was the best part of the shabu shabu. 

However, I preferred the congbul to the shabu shabu, as the congbul was more flavorful than the shabu shabu. The congbul was like eating spicy fried rice sans rice. Then it really became spicy fried rice because the servers helped us add the rice to our dish. Tasty, but I'm pretty sure I can make this at home. Well, at least a good enough substitution that I wouldn't necessarily need to eat out for it. However, it was a lovely experience to have, and I wouldn't mind doing it again. Price to portion-wise, I think the congbul is also a better deal than the shabu shabu.

The haemul pajeon was around $17, if I recall correctly. It was of a decent size, and there was a good amount of seafood mix in it. It was quite tasty. It was crispy on the outside, and almost gooey on the inside. We all enjoyed it. It's not the cheapest haemul pajeon around, but it's also not the most expensive. I would rather order this than the shabu shabu.

The congbul and/or the shabu shabu was served with steamed egg (I'm a sucker for Korean steamed egg, and it was very good here), seaweed soup, and four side dishes. There was a coleslaw my brother really enjoyed, a seaweed dish with spicy sauce, cabbage kimchi, and something like cabbage slices and cucumbers in some kind of soy sauce. Other than the steamed egg, the rest of the side dishes did not impress me particularly, but they were also not off-putting. 

Two portions of each of the congbul and the shabu shabu and one order of the haemul pajeon was just enough to feed 5 adults, with a little bit of leftover for breakfast for the next day. I might be back with friends so they can try out the congbul. If not, it's because I'm exploring all the other Korean restaurants around the area.",2016-09-17 01:16:10

We were served all of the preliminaries (ex water, bread) promptly. To start out the hubby orders clam chowder, which he says was very good but, not as good as Chart House's. I order the spinach salad which contained sliced strawberries, watermelon, nuts, bleu cheese, and a very light dressing--too light, almost non-existent. I do not recommend this salad. 

With our entrées we ordered a very nice Pinot Noir by Macmurry Ranch. Our entrees were a filet mignon and a surf and turf (6oz filet and 1lb. of split king crab legs).

Came back recently with my friend and my oldest child.  We had the pleasure of having Eunice serve us and she went above and beyond not only for us but for all of her tables - no joke.  She was so fun around my kiddo and treated him really well.  She was very engaging with him and my friend and I as well so that is always appreciated and that does not go unnoticed by me.

We ordered all of our food from the happy hour menu.  2x veggie tempuras, edamame, 2 rolls for 9.95 (California and calamari).  A single order of veggie tempura would be large enough to split between two people and we regret ordering 2.  Not because it wasn't delicious but it was so much food!  Both rolls were very good but I found the calamari roll to be slightly too salty.  I would order it again though.

If you are on a budget but want some quality food, definitely stop by during happy hour.  You and your wallet will leave full.",2017-06-24 20:53:26

I had a chicken wrap, and it was beautifully grilled, juicy, and moist. The fries were very crispy, and on par with what you would get at any other Paramount location. 

The staff were great. They pointed out that it would be cheaper for me to get the combo (wrap + fries + drink), than to get the wrap + drink on their own. And they were right! I ended up saving money and got more food in the end!

An empty, great space that could be used as a regular business function which includes a full size basketball court, rock climbing wall, a martial arts room, batting cages and i believe they also have an RC track. Definitely a wasted space that could be/should be utilized. 

Nonetheless... on with the review. 

There was a Groupon deal when I searched, which gives you a 2 for 1 ride versus their standard rate. Don't be discouraged by the staff, they are certainly don't excel in the customer service department and are rude to customers who particularly probably aren't aware of what needs to happen before stepping into to the pit. Literally, you pay and they tell you to go to the tent and press the play button --- then you kind of have to direct yourself. 

Our first race went great until about the last 2-3 laps where my car wasn't going as fast as it did initially. I attributed it to low gas, so I didn't think much of it. -- we waited a couple of turns to get on with our second race. My car in particular, I felt was controlled to go slower. I KNOW THEY HAVE THAT FUNCTION. It just really impeded the fun factor. I literally had my hands in the air - gesturing WTF. I didn't pay $$ to simply have someone whizz by me in an apparent indication that their car was simply going faster than mine! and this is on a straight away and no difference in momentum. I was so highly irritated, that I was going to say something until we had our own personal issue of one of the kids in my group lost their cell phone. The guys offered to haphazardly scooter around the track and did not find hint of the phone (told us in the most discouraging manner), but when we looked -- we ended up finding the cell phone untouched. I'm just glad we were able to find the phone. 

Service was below par. I wouldn't think to spend another over $100 trip for my kiddos here. I'll take it elsewhere.

Our server came to greet us right away and started pouring us some water, which was very much welcomed since it was extremely hot outside that day. He then explained the summerlicious menu and told us his favorites with lots of excitement. I ordered the pork tostada, steak and frites, and blueberry crumble. Didnt have to wait too long between meals. Pork tostada was good, generous amount of pulled pork! Steak and fries was a disappoinment, the steak was small (smaller than the size of my palm) and there's just too much fries on the plate. The presentation was lacking, borderline poor. The cook on the steak was medium well when I asked for a medium. Too lazy to return it since I was starving. The BIGGEST LETDOWN of the night was the blueberry crumble. WHAT A JOKE!! It's exactly what you would find at Starbucks, their blueberry bar. Had 3 bites before I gave up. It was not good.

Concerned, thorough, and caring.  But she's booked up for the next several weeks, and the winter school break was a convenient time to do this.  So I accepted a different MD at the office.

Today we saw Dr Keane.  Seemed like a nice lady, but she was not at all thorough.  This visit was a simple wellness/physical.  She hardly touched our daughter.  Other than listening to the heart and breathing, and asking ""how do you feel"", she really did nothing.  When I inquired about birth control pills for her severe menstrual cramps (a routine treatment for that problem) she made it sound like we were asking for experimental radical therapies!  It was absurd.  I suspect she has personal objections to 'the pill', which is even more annoying (since she is to treat our daughter, not impose her own preferences on her).

If I could move our daughter to an ob-gyn, I would.  But none will see her until she's 18.  Ditto our adult family doctor.  Seems silly since she's physically an adult now, but that's the policy.  Next physical I will be certain we get Dr Khurana again, and we'll ask that question again about the cramps (assuming she still has them, which she probably will).

I rated 3 stars because of Dr Keane.  She's a 2-star doctor, in my opinion.  If it were just Dr Khurana I would give 5 stars in a heart-beat.  I cannot comment on the other physicians in this practice.  We will not see Dr Keane again.",2012-12-25 18:54:16

The resort is nice with a bowling ally, movie theater, casino, bars and restaurant on-site. This is a locals casino so I wasn't expecting too much strip magic. 

The resort rooms are nice with modern technology (lcd tv, alarm clock, etc). The bathrooms are a bit drab but are cleverly designed with bathtub and toilet separated from the sink room allowing use of the sink while someone else is showering. South Point gives out Bath and Body Works bath products which is a big plus! 

The buffet was very average and did not justify the hour wait me and my friend had to endure. I would recommend the coffee shop over the buffet. 

Staying at South Point and frequenting the strip was a bit of a chore as the hotel is pretty far. It is about a 10 - 15 min drive from the rest of the hotels on the strip.

This was actually the first time I had eaten here. I had heard the rumors of great sweet potato fries. Those rumors proved to be true. They were really great. Sweet with a touch of spicy. And whatever that honey sauce they served with it... I practically liked it clean. And stole my friends container of it too. 

But the rest of the experience, not so great. I ordered a veggie wrap as well and it was pitiful. Pretty much spinach with a few red peppers tossed in the mix and a dollop of hummus. It was very bland and really in sad shape. 

Our server was also not very happy with us towards the end. I will tell you exactly what happened so as not to confuse the situation. Was it busy? Yes. Was she friendly up until the check issue? Yes. Do I understand how things work because I've been a server before? Yes!

So the problem... there were 5 of us ladies who, of course, did not have much cash with us. She told us at first the system ""couldn't process"" more than 3 cards and cash payment split between us. She left us to figure things out. She comes back and we asked her if we could pay with 2 cards and cash, and she said no, their policy is that during conventions or busy times, they just don't split bills or payment. A little bit conflicting? Yes. She also told us the policy is on the menu. Now I cannot attest to whether it is or not, but I would be curious to know. 

Now I understand that in some instances places prefer you to pay in cash in a larger group, but usually they will tell you that at the beginning of the meal. This did not happen. I guess what I'm trying to say was that there were holes to the story. Whether it is restaurant policy or not, I just don't think it was communicated properly. She was clearly frustrated with us and it was a bit of a frustrating situation.

Not a big deal, just a little unusual to have just one dairy choice.  

I ordered a salad and I did get it right away but it looked kind of thrown together.  The non-greens consisted of an assortment of these hand-torn, small ""nubbins"":  chicken, avacado, and pepperjack cheese.  With about a teaspoon of black beans, this constituted the salad, along with one pre-packaged Marzetti's salad dressing--kind of like what you'd get at the salad bar from a grocery store.  It was good, the greens were fresh, but it was not a memorable salad.

Their normal hours for walk ins are 11am-12pm and I want to say 5:30pm-6:30pm. If those times do not work for you, they give the option of calling in to set an appointment. 

The cost of the class is $25. You can find cheaper proctors, but I was in a crunch. Now I am legal to handle alcohol. Less time to consume and more time watching other people enjoy. Bitterness is coursing through me as I type.",2011-04-15 03:58:57

Stopped by here for a quick drink (cousins birthday) before shopping at BiLo. 

It's the old Bellacino's Grinders. They changed the inside a bit. Kinda weird tho. About 10-15 (4 seat) tables to the right. 1 long booth that has 2 tables to them. The bar.... Well that's kinda cray. It's one 5 seat bar in front. You get to the second bar by going into what one may consider the kitchen. We saw a few ppl sitting there. At 1st we thought they were employees because of the location of the bar. 

Very nice servers. I think they were the owners. (Maybe sisters. Idk) we didn't order any food but noticed a guy in the Val Hand Tossing pizza dough. And a family dressed in church clothes eating. And a few young ppl in there munching it up. 

Pretty good lunch specials and drink specials.

Loved this place from the moment I walked in. they're selection is so vast that I felt I was in El Paso, tx tasting authentic Mexican food. I really don't even know where to begin. I feel like a child who has a million things running through my head but can't say them all at once.

We headed towards the produce first, which had amazingly good prices and had a great choice of chiles, dried fruit and beans. The only part I didn't like was the dried fruit section you needed someone to help you and we stood for ten minutes with no one showing up. 

Moving on, we went down an isle that had all the Mexican candies, at exceptional prices. They had the big Mexican brand cupcakes, cookies and chips. My husband was like a giddy little girl and are basket was full of junk he grew up with. I admit I through a couple items in myself, charge me guilty.

Next, we saw their meat selection. Holy cow! Come with patience to wit because there was a long line and a selection that was mind boggling. From pig feet, to brain, regular steak, to intestines. Seasoned or unseasoned, in big qualities and affordable prices. Can't wait to buy the stuff for my tamales here. E meat looked so fresh, I could tell they sell a lot of meat per day.

Walking by, on the left is a fresh salsa, drinks and fruits. Fruit salad, fresh water melon drinks, hot salsas, cactus fruit, etc etc. They had about four different sour creams, don't ask me. What the differences were but I picked one and bought it. It was creamy, milky and hella good. So fresh I could have sworn they made it that day. Sorry dallop a daisy, I've found a new sour cream.

Next I noticed they have a fresh tortilla factory, where they make them fresh, and were making them as we walked by. Corn, flour and special corn tortillas made for my favorite.. Flauntas! They're oval and made just for them. 

We decided to stop at their...? Deli? Restaurant? Quick order section? Not sure what to call it but on the right we ordered the corn in the stick with mayo, butter, cheese and hot sauce. O the left we ordered flautas, rice and beans. All of the above were delcious. Muy bueno.",2013-07-08 08:19:27

R5OmeystXFk166kHJUdOqQ,XMy-OTpVY8O1L-8w1zOKcw,m7Pr86BWoqbSsLo4e0TERw,2,9,7,5,"So my best friend in the whole world (and another Yelper) was born on New Year's Day, and her daughter was also born the same day.  (What are the odds??)   They wanted an intimate get together to celebrate both of their recent birthdays and this restaurant was their choice.   

Okay, no point in beating around the bush...I'll just come right out and say it; our waitress was friggen awful.  She left us high and dry for several minutes at a time and she completely forgot to bring me a high chair.  Finally after waiting for about 30 minutes for her to remember to bring me a high chair, another diner at our table went and found one since I was having trouble keeping my wiggly daughter sitting on my lap.  

And I could make a big deal about the fact that we were seated for probably 30 minutes before she even took our orders, and probably about 25 more minutes before they brought us our appetizers, and that she never even once asked if we wanted to see a drink menu and I finally had to ask if they even offered cocktails and that finally prompted her to produce a drink menu about 20 minutes and another request later (20 minutes, I'm not kidding).  

Since my husband doesn't drink and is my permanent designated driver, and we were celebrating, I got a pineapple mojito, minus the pineapple.  No, I didn't order my pineapple mojito without the pineapple, it just came that way.  So it was just a mojito flavored mojito.  Now, to be fair it was still a damn tasty mojito, but I don't think it had passed within 22' feet of a pineapple, EVER.  I'm just saying.'  Our waitress obviously didn't notice that when she got our order from the bartender either.  I just have to repeat it; she really isn't very good at what she does.  I'm sorry, I know that is harsh.  And despite the fact that I was in a party of three (yes, I knew the other diners, but we were all on separate checks) I still got hit with an automatic 18% gratuity for a large party.  WTF?  Really?! Ugh...   

But then let's talk about the food.  When they finally decided to serve us food it was a mixed experience.  My baby daughter got a tempura plate and I think she really enjoyed it.  She ate a little bit of everything and enjoyed dipping her fried shrimp and veggies in the dipping sauce.  I tasted her food and it wasn't bad at all.  And the mushroom soup that comes as an appetizer with the teppan entrees is delicious.  I mean really, really good.  I don't know how they prepare it, but it was staggeringly good and I would've consumed a gallon of that stuff.  Also, the salad with orange ginger dressing was very cold and crisp and delicious too.  

For dinner my husband ordered the vegetarian teppan and I ordered the combo teppan dinner with scallops and sirloin steak.  (Side note: I love scallops, but the last 3 times I had them prepared in a restaurant I had gotten violently ill.  I knew I was taking my chances with getting another bad batch, but I wanted scallops again so bad I decided to roll the dice.)  The good news?  I didn't get sick afterwards, these scallops were very fresh.  The bad news?  They were so fresh that they still had fresh little pieces of sand embedded all throughout them.  You never want to bite into a scallop and hear a crunch:  EVER.   Also my food was horribly over salted, and I do mean horribly.   I'm no shrinking violet when it comes to salt, but this was too much salt, even for me.

Also, my scallops were done cooking a full 15 minutes before my medium rare steak was done.  That kinda sucked as they could have easily been timed better by the chef.  Our chef was very friendly.  The fried rice that comes as a side with the teppan dinner was pretty good, but nowhere near as garlic-buttery-tastic and delicious as the chicken fried rice served at another unnamed teppan place that I routinely go to in Tempe...

The damage for our whole dinner and my drink was about $70, so it wasn't too bad in the grand scheme of fresh prepared teppan dinners.  I just wish the service had been better and the scallops hadn't been full of sand. 

But you know what's most important? That my best friend and niece had a great birthday party.  And at the end of the night, despite the hiccups with the food and service, I think they did have a good time.  And THAT is *still* what matters most to me.

This location is large and luxurious and goes beyond food, treats and necessities. At the cash register they were giving away free puppy treats that looked like sushi and were made of salmon jerky. 

Their doggy fashion section essentially looks like an H&M for dogs. Everything you can think of in every size and colour, though I think it's actually *slightly* more expensive than H&M. To be fair, people who spoil their dogs spoiiiil them, so you might as well mark those items up. That's just a good business plan.   

The staff is knowledgeable and kind, and helped me find the perfect snacks for my God Daughter Berkeley, and even gave me some free samples. Both Berk and I love samples.

The taste? Ehh, they're steamed veggies.  Nothing to write home about, but my guess is that this kind of stuff isn't meant to really meant to impress your taste buds anyway. 

So I make my judgement of Crave based on these other factors instead:
- Sauce provides most of the flavour and in my case, the pom puree and garlic basil pesto provided a much-needed wakeup call to the tempeh (which on its own tastes like a slightly salty, dense tofu) 
- Vegetables are fresh and vibrant
- Pricing I think is more reasonable in comparison to its competitors, including the fact that they thankfully don't have additional charge for extra sauce
- Bottled, fruit-infused water tastes more like water with stale fruit inside. I'd say skip this stuff and just go for the Perrier instead
- There's a constant lineup at the cash and customers waiting for their food, but don't be worried as it moves quickly

I ordered their version of a cold brew coffee - with room for cream. As I had missed breakfast - I also ordered a breakfast sandwich - bacon, eggs, and cheese - served on a warmed croissant roll.

The cold brew coffee was strong and delicious. The breakfast sandwich - by itself would be 3 stars at most. The problem was the bacon was underdone and chewy. The bacon needed to be cooked a little longer - I had some portions of the bacon strips that undercooked. I was already in the car and headed to the Airport - so I did not have time to go back and request they address this shortcoming. The sandwich also needed more cheese. The egg portion of the sandwich was fine.

It's a small place inside - so not a lot of interior seating - there is some outdoor seating.

I would come back here again and give them another shot on the breakfast sandwich.

- Along Queen street (east of Bathurst, west of Spadina), accessible by TTC and car; street parking available and I believe near the side streets as well
- When I went, they're going renovations and the gelato bar is only open; but once they're complete with renos, it will be all vegan gelato with better furniture and interior
- Staff were friendly and nice; you can taste all the flavors before making your selection (which helps a lot!)

Food
- Decided to go with the Pistachio Baklava Yogurt
- Anything pistachio is always a must try in my opinion; and this doesn't disappoint - they use real pistachio (i.e. you can actually taste the nuts) and it's more yellow-ish in colour (green ones are artifical)
- The gelato was very smooth and on sweeter end since it's baklava, but it blended well together with the pistachio; really enjoyed this combo
- Also sampled the raspberry tandori, which is sour and has a good spicy kick at the end (might not be everyone's favourite); cold brew vegan, basically is strong dark coffee, bitter but refreshing


One scoop in a cup was around $5, which is pretty reasonable.
I'll definitely swing by and come back to try their different flavors - like their creativity like Carrot Yuzu, Black Garlic Fennel, Blueberry Lavender Lemonade",2018-07-04 17:18:46

I know they were closed for a bit for renovations (installed a few new booths where the bar was before) so not sure if it changed ownership or management.

They use to have a special for $10 draft pitchers of Amsterdam but that was no longer available.  In fact, beer had disappeared off the drink menu all together.

When my glass noodles arrived, I was less than impressed.  It looked like a mound of clumpy noodles, all stuck together in a gross massive heap.  The noodles tasted a bit burnt and they were super spicy.  I don't remember seeing any indication of spice on the menu.  Not appetizing at all.

They also  have a large wine selection if you are wanting to buy a bottle to share there or take home.",2016-12-12 13:00:34

This location at on Dixon where Cityview meets has been here for quite some time.  The drive through is sort of a strange deal because it goes around a business which is at the end of a strip mall type structure while the inside is irregularly shaped  (pie?).

The place can be extremely busy especially if there's something going on at the Toronto Congress center which is basically just down the street.  This area in general has a lot of airport and convention traffic so the restaurant itself is or can be as busy as the area is at any given time.

Harvey's has flame grilled burgers and being a Cara company the standards are pretty much the same across the board.  Burgers, fries, onion rings etc are all good and I like the fact that their bottles of water are almost 600ml as opposed to just 500ml.

Tell them what you want on your burger as far as toppings, sauces etc since it's all made to order.  The angus burgers are larger than just your ""original"" and the texture just seems less processed than the original burgers.  Frings which are fries and rings combo are an extra cost?  They've added different drinks and even fried mini doughnuts kind of like what Swiss Chalet has just not on a plate with drizzle and whipped cream.

Watch your step as you leave the restaurant as to not get run over... the drive through is around the entrances.",2017-05-18 18:19:29

OMG, I had a bad experience here. 
First, I was waiting in a line to order my food and this lady that came after me cut in the line. Well, this happens a lot to me for some reason (If you are from Japan, you may know this, too), but usually employees say something to the person and they realize I was there before. This store, I know this guy working here saw the lady squeezed right in front of me but he didn't say anything. Nothing, instead he started taking this lady's order. Fine. I don't get crazy with this kind of small stuff. 
Then, my turn came. I could tell this tall skinny kid that was taking my order was very nervous. I ordered regular bowl, half rice and half lettuce. He put just rice. No lettuce. I didn't say anything because maybe they put lettuce after or on top. He told me to pick two proteins. So I said salmon and shrimp. He put three tiny salmon cubes on top of the rice and he started to shredding one shrimp in three or four pieces with his shaky hands... WTH?! I had to say something but I didn't know what to say because maybe that's their way to do things here... So I said ""I wanted half rice and half lettuce on the bottom..."" The girl that was working noticed me saying that and saw what he was doing. She remade my bowl. She put six pieces of salmon and she didn't shred the shrimp by hands, thank God. 1 star for remaking my bowl but the guy that looked like the manager seemed annoyed. (I got super annoyed by him giving me a dirty look.)
I am not blaming this kid because I have experienced the same when I was his age. (high school) This was probably his first or second day at this job and he was in training. I know it's nerve-racking very first day or second day at any kind of job. Someone or the manager should've watched him when he was making the bowl. Not his fault at all.
Still, $8.99 for what I got is way too overpriced. (Sorry, I'm used to Poke Express's price) If it's in NYC or on the Vegas strip, I would say the price is reasonable but this is on Rainbow and Windmill... Really?! Why so skimpy on the shrimps also? I saw one guy complaining there was no shrimp in his 808 bowl. 
Not coming back. I would not recommend this place. Go elsewhere to get your Poke. 
(Oh, about the food. I forgot. Just like any other similar places like here. Fresh and delicious. +1 more star then. Okay.)",2016-07-10 19:51:31

The food quality was good but dishes were not well-prepared, the service was poor, and they basically charge Strip prices. What's the point of a spot in a locals casino that doesn't seem to offer locals any benefit over Strip restaurants - maybe people who live around here just really don't want to drive to the Strip? Unfortunately that's also no plus for me, as I don't live in the area.

To expand slightly - I ordered the ribeye, which was good but was overcooked (ordered medium rare, came out medium - maybe even medium plus). My party got the mac and cheese, potatoes, and creamed corn sides and I thought all tasted fine but they were served at best lukewarm. I did really like the lobster chowder soup I got, though. But overall, while stuff tasted fine, it was not cooked right.

Service was not good. There were long delays for everything - to be seated, to get our menus, to order, to get refills, to get the check, etc. etc. Really gave the impression that the waitstaff didn't care. And our waiter was pretty pretentious too. I was surprised by this given that this place is targeted more towards locals, but the attitudes felt worse here than a lot of Strip restaurants I've been to.

I'll still consider coming back for happy hour, but there's no chance I'll pay Strip prices for such a lacking dinner product and experience. Even if avoiding the Strip, there are a lot better places across the valley to go to for steak.",2016-07-31 06:21:49

It blows my mind that this place is only rated a 3.5/5. Where's the love Yelpers?

Let me say that I've been drinking Bubble Tea for a long time, and engaged in a quest to find the best in the city. I've had drinks from Ten Rens, Tea Shop 168, Chatime, Destiny's, and Go For Tea to name a few, and each of these places pale in comparison to the quality of Green Grotto.

My go-to drink is always the Lychee Green Tea with Tapioca. You can really tell if a Bubble Tea place is good by the aroma of the tea once it's been shaken. Firstly, a layer of foam consisting of microscopic bubbles should form on top of the drink. Second, a floral aroma should permeate throughout. Green Grotto has got these 2 components down!

Their tea is the best tea I've had anywhere. I think it has a lot to do with the quality of the leaves they purchase, and the method they use to steep them.

I also love that they use both small and big tapioca in their drinks. Textural contrast people! So fun to drink. I hate when you go to certain places and the tapioca is mushy. These are super springy, and just perfect.

The owners are from Taiwan, the home of Bubble Tea. May be that's the reason it's so good! I will return every week for my regular order :D",2013-07-06 22:00:57

LW4EHLOnS-jNMiabl5jXPg,VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,f8IMQgRwo-8GP372MElDGQ,3,2,0,0,"Last time I was here, was back in December of 2007.  Back again, 4 years later, they did a lot of improvements, which I'll give them that.  But there are still some things that I dislike about this place.  

Located on Main Street and behind Fremont street, Plaza still stands tall.  Despite the fact that, they closed for a while.  They manage to reopen with a whole new look, new furniture, and a new atmosphere.  

We arrived in the afternoon to the parking garage and we notice that they actually have security letting you in the garage.  Back in 2007, its like a free for all parking.  Even though it is free, at least they monitor people who goes in.  Still the same old garage, but its one of the few free ones downtown.  

Walking inside, it seems brighter and a bit more lively.  2007, was a bit of a darkish feel to it.  But this time around, It did feel a bit warmer than before.  Took us a few minutes to get to the check in desk from the garage but we were able to see a lot of new addition to the place.  Island Sushi Hawaiian Grill, Hash House A Go Go, and Gigi's Cupcakes, are some of the few new places to check out.  

It was a Wednesday afternoon, check in was a cinch and not as busy.  We were booked in our room in the south tower.  We didn't mind the walk, and feel a bit more at ease that they have security who's watching who goes in the elevators.  8th floor and at the far end of the hotel, is our room, and this is the dislike part.  

In 2007, the color scheme was darkish, the carpets seem like they haven't been vacuumed, but I wasn't really there to enjoy it, just to get myself settled into Vegas.  But now, December 2011, the color scheme seems brighter, the carpet was changed, and a better TV.  What I dislike about it, was that, we only got 3 small pillows for a king size bed.  There's not much of a closet, but a place to hang your jacket next to the bathroom sink.  I'm sure the safe works, but unfortunately, ours didn't.  You have new furniture's, but what's good is a desk, if you really don't have a chair to sit in.  You have a new TV, but, what good is it, when you really don't have a remote control for it.  I know they did change the wallpaper, but it did look like it was falling apart.  The bathroom is still cramped as I remembered it.  Still no hair dryer, no ironing board and a lot of wasted space and bare walls.  

As for the casino floor, the dealers actually do smile at you, but communication tend to still be limited.  They tend to be lively in a way, but after the fact that you start tipping them.  But they were nice than the last time I was there.  

My overall thoughts and recommendation.  If you are looking for a place to lay your head and not care much about the room.  Plaza is the place that is a decent price. It's one of those rooms where you get wasted and just want a place to crash.  It is nice in a way, but limited things to be nice about.  What I do like about it, it's right next to the Fremont Street Experience, there is a lot of things to do there than to stay inside Plaza.",2011-12-22 20:54:47

I went with the Lawry Cut ($43): Mashed Potatoes, Yorkshire Pudding, and Creamed Spinach ($6). Again, not a big fan of prime rib, but this was pretty tasty. The sides are all good...nothing extraordinary, but solid company for the beef.

Also added a Lobster Tail ($14). Good lobster at a great price if you add it to a prime rib dinner. Wish it was a little more tender or flavorful, but a solid choice nonetheless.

And finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($8): Warm Toffee Caramel Sauce and Häagen-Dazs Pralines & Cream. Pretty good! Don't compare it to GR's version, and you will enjoy it :P

Overall, it's a solid restaurant, and if you are a prime rib fan, I think you will have a great time!

We sat ourselves as the place was bustling [all the 20+ bar seats were taken] around 8:30p on a weeknight. Our waitress, Jillian, was bubbly, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered all of our questions about the menu. Our service was very good during our meal despite the crowd. 

Great beer selection, over 10 on draft craft beers [including 3-4 christmas ales, and bonus points for Bell's] from all over the country, and over 20 microbrew bottle selections and several Belgians. Additionally, they were reasonably priced [and I can be stingy on my beer prices]. Great lighting. There's a few televisions over the bar. The space itself is nice with exposed brick, the appropriate amount of lighting [some places I find to be too dark]. The space is also relatively large and features seating at and near the bar and also away from it. 

I only had the Duck mac and Cheese [recently moved to the app menu]: creamy with plenty of duck meat. For $8, the portion was priced well. Note the kitchen closes at 11 [at least on weekdays]. 

There's also Trivial Pursuit cards at the bar [I love this, and good fun for my friends and me, even if the cards were all older than we were]. 

Compared to other gastropubs that I've been to in the area, Deagan's was a tad cheaper and less cramped with its seating than the Taphouse. Compared to Cento, Deagan's came off as slightly less sophisticated in its atmosphere [still above a typical bar] and has TVs.

All of these words can be used to describe Chicago Joe's. Well it's a homey, no-frills, Italian restaurant located in what used to be a small house in downtown Las Vegas - so what is there not to like?

I had the lovely experience of joining a large group for a pre-set meal at Chicago Joes. Although we did get some choices of what we would like. From the wine to the home made cannoli, I must say Chicago Joes, you've impressed me.

They did start us out with their bread sticks, however they weren't really the consistency I tend to enjoy. None the less, with balsamic and oil to dip them in they were a lovely treat! Next came the salad, a bit small and only iceberg lettuce. However, the house dressing made up for the lack of more leafy greens. 

I opted for the RED marinara, clam sauce spaghetti. I am so glad I went with this choice because it was absolutely delicious. Out of everything I ate here, it was the star. I couldn't believe clams could be do delicious!

I recently went there and got a free meal worth $7 with an order of a meal for signing up on their app. For 2 3 piece meals to be worth only about $11, that's an excellent deal! 

Now that I have claimed this reward, I received another for a family meal! This is great! 

The first time we visited this location, I believe it probably was the manager who came to our table and offered us a churro for free. It was actually very good! I was surprised that they had such bad reviews and he shared that those reviews were in about their first week of opening and he promised that the service would improve. I honestly have not had any issues with service in the 3 times I've been there. 

You will notice that this branch looks a lot nicer than other branches of el pollo loco. I actually like this one the best.

First, the ambience is really nice. The bar wasn't too busy, so we sat down and was greeted by the bartender named Chris. We aren't hardcore drinkers, so he recommended us some drinks! I got the piña colda and it was so delicious and refreshing! We stayed at the bar for a few hours hanging out and getting lost in the amazing atmosphere! Chris was incredibly sweet and talked to us and gave us recommendations on what's good on the menu. We ordered the creme brule, which I am usually not a fan of to begin with. I am so glad Chris recommended that to us, because I almost cried taking my first bite!

I've heard good things about their yakitori grill so I decided to get the yakitori combo - 5 skewers of the chef's choice. There was tendon, liver, teriyaki chicken, chicken legs, and chicken meatball. It was an interesting assortment and was really was grilled to perfection. While they were all tasty, I probably would stick to the chicken legs/teriyaki though. The tendon and liver didn't quite satisfy my palate. 

The osaka cha han was one of the cheaper entrees on the menu and don't be fooled, there's quite a bit of of fried rice there! It was really good. There's that sweet and tanginess from the mayo/HP sauce. If you like fried rice and/or takoyaki there is no doubt you will love this. There is more than enough to share. The takoyaki was piping hot and fresh. It was a tad crispier than the usual (in a good way!).

I have had the teba gyoza (the stuffed chicken wings) on my first visit here and really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend it! It is a hefty half fried chicken wing stuffed with a pork dumpling. That's kind of a match made in heaven. It was pretty darn juicy.

I was taught to evaluate my poutine by:

- Fries
- Gravy
- Curds
- Extra stuff

As for Smoke's...
Fries: Could be crispier.  Not too skinny, not too fat.

Gravy: Taste - Sweeter than expected, not meaty tasting
            Acidity - Could have used more vinegar.   
            Temp - Warm - Not quite hot enough to make the curds melty

Curds - There were some! At least they used curds but they weren't 
as fresh and squeaky.

Extra stuff: Fries come in a cute box! Size small is a good portion, large is a bit large. If they had an in between size, it would be just right!

I ordered the pulled pork poutine.
It was REALLY good.
I probably found the gravy a bit sweet because of the sauce from the pulled pork.  More of  a sweeter bbq sauce than spicy and tangy.

Overall, I like this place and will go back.
They have a lot of cool toppings! I can see why this place is so popular.

I originally used to eat at their first location in Markham. And was super excited when I found out they opened this one on Don Mills. 

The price has increased about 3 times since they opened. I think at one point it was 22.99$ then 24.99 and now since I visited today it was 31.99$ for weekends ! That's very expensive for an AYCE place and especially since the quality isn't the same as it once was. 

The food usually comes in a fast manner and they'd never miss an item you order. Although lately it's been slow, and the seaweed is soggy aka translate to sitting around for long periods of time. Instead of still crunchy!

Their spicy dishes are spicy.  We've got a high spice tolerance (when in India we order spiciness ""as the chef would prepare for himself""), but I found a 2-star to be definitively spicy and enjoyable.  A 3-star might have been too much.  Be warned.

The side dishes were very tasty, though the typical-Wisconsin elbow macaroni salad with mayonnaise seemed completely incongruous.

On the upside -- the floors did not have that sticky quality that I associate with movie theaters around the world. The seats were really comfortable. And a latte or a beer during a movie is a plus for some.

This is TRULY a little strip mall dive.  Walk up and order, industrial-strength seating (i.e. hard/indestructible), etc.  None of that is a bad thing at all.. just trying to be sure everyone's expectations are set properly.  I wasn't sure if this was a sit-down joint or not, based on all I'd seen/read.  Now I know.  Frankly, I prefer it this way.

The tacos looked mighty good and I HAD to try them.  But I was also lured by the cheese crisp, with carne asada.  $6 for a combo with no steak, only $6.75 with.  Holy cow, there was a TON of steak in this thing, and it was humangous!  But it wasn't what I'd call a cheese crisp, it was really a quesadilla, at least by all of my past Mexican food experiences.  Nonetheless, it was pretty tasty, and a BIG meal by the time you threw in the beans & rice (which were very average).  I also got a chicken taco, on corn tortillas.  The tortillas are tiny, but they load the thing up with a lot of meat and fixins, so at $1.15 (!), they're an awesome deal, and VERY tasty.

On the Brak-o-meter, the taco rates a solid 5 stars, the cheese crisp a good 3.5 stars, and value rates 5.. for a composite average of 4 or thereabouts.

I needed a steakhouse before Coldplay concert and they were the closest, so I booked reservations and we showed up blind.

Best blind choice I have made.  It is not an overly large steakhouse, has a more intimate setting, the staff are AMAZING and the food was fabulous.  There were 4 of us and we ordered for appetizers the seared ahi tuna with melon and the calamari.  The calamari has to be one of the best calamari I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly, a lot of flavor and still so tender.  I didn't even need the dipping sauce, it was too good on its own.  The seared ahi was prepared perfectly and the blend of flavors with the ripe melon and salad was excellent.  It was light and tasty and perfect for summer.

For our main courses we ordered the New York Strip (thickest strip I have ever seen), The porterhouse (very generous), filet mignon and king crab legs.  EVERYONE cleared their plates, my son helped me with the crab, because the order was just too much for me, but they were SO good.

Our side dishes were the onion rings, the special that night: bacon cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Everything was very good, but the mashed potatoes.. WOW, I could have made that my meal and have been very happy with it.

I went spicy (yes, it is very spicy for the Gringo palate). Then pick a green, then a protein (chicken, beef, lamb, vegan, cheese or veggie). Then you add in the toppings - way too many to list here. Finally, choose a sauce. I went with the herb tahini. When I go back, I will ask them to go light on the sauce. There are so many wonderful flavors in the bowl, it really doesn't need any sauce so it's a pity to mask them with tahini sauce (which was quite good). Dinner for 2 for about $15.

They have all the dim sum favorites: har kao, siu mai dumplings. Their char siu paos are to die for. The dough is steamed flawlessly fluffy and the filling, both sweet and savory. I enjoyed their chives dumpling very much. The skin was thin, panfried. The filling was texturific with the chives just cooked. The pei dan chok or Century egg porridge was pure comfort food. I liked their kai lan with oyster sauce. It was not overly sauced and veggies were still green and not overcooked. Their lo pak gou or white radish cake was nicely steamed and fried. I loved it.

The technicians were friendly, attentive, and beverages were offered.  The technician helped me decide on my nail color and I am glad I listened to her because the result was beautiful.  The price was great for the additional services I received.  If I am in the area again and in need of a mani/pedi, I may stop in but for separate services.",2017-10-20 15:22:13

However, I came here twice and unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of their food. We started out with the fried chicken skins. I can't recall in my lifetime where I have had fried chicken skins and didn't like it...Until I had the fried chicken skins at Okra. It's not bad by any means. It just tasted really bland. I guess I was expecting extremely crispy, salty chicken skins and I ended up being disappointed. The grilled oysters were pretty good. I usually like my oysters raw but those were delicious. The mussels were good too, but the cornbread it came with was ordinary. I had their shrimp and grits and thought it was okay. My boyfriend had the chicken and dumplings and thought it wasn't anything special.

It's a great space, however, the pizzas were a little less than average. After ordering the Chianti and this new recommend red blend, we tried the Tuscan salad, prosciutto and fig pizza and the Diavolo pizza. Our wine was tasty and priced very well ($5-&7)

Back to the pizza: too much arugula on the fig pizza and not enough cheese. For the Diavolo which is a spicy salami pizza, there was not enough sauce and it was pretty bland. My date commented and said that he felt like he liked the pizza at Sauce more than their pizza. And at a heck of smaller bill, I would agree. 

Out of everything, the salad was the best. Great bacon flavor and crunch...the cherry tomatoes were sweet and fresh. Ordering the small was enough to split between 2 people. With the mailer: 3 glasses of wine, small salad and 2 signature pizzas, our bill including tip was ~$50. 

Service was a plus and salad was a plus but if the place is supposed to be a modern Italian restaurant, think we will pass on Stone and Vine...especially since we tried their pizzas.",2016-08-24 23:45:05

Glass nickel has a nice draft selection as well as one of my favorite bartenders, Hannah. She's a sweetie.

Pizza margarita with extra garlic is my favorite. I once ordered a basket ofi shrimp and fries and was impressed with the shrimp because they were fairly large and good portion. I was expecting a few tiny shrimp. Owners are always accomadating and make you feel like royalty. That's another plus.

This restaurant has been open for a really long time and I'm surprised that it's so busy. I don't know if this is normal for Mesa Grill or if it was because of restaurant week. Who knows?

Maybe it was because of the food. Everything we had was delicious, each with its own memorable thing.

Appetizers:
-Roasted corn soup- tasty. I enjoyed the hint of avocado and salsa in the center of the bowl. It complimented the soup.
-Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck - the hit at the table. It came highly recommended and one of the signature dishes on the menu. The thin blue corn crepe wrapped slices of AMAZING BBQ duck. And the sauce had a very nice spice to it.

Entrees:
-Lobster Out of the Shell - yummy yummy especially since I didn't have to fight with it getting it out of the shell. The butter sauce was delish (who doesn't love butter?) and the crispy hominy cakes were a nice contrast in texture.
-Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - mmm. cooked to perfection. Nice flavors and the sauce 
-Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin - the meat was nice and tender and the rub on the outside of the pork gave it a really nice spice.
-Pan Seared Halibut - it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes.

Side dish:
Double baked potato- had a light horseradish flavor, and overall a good baked potato.

Dessert:
-Pineapple Buttermilk Upside down cake - disappointing. The caramelized rum sauce was very strong and I didn't enjoy it. However, the accompanying pineapple vanilla ice cream was very light and refreshing.
-Creme brulee - a nice large portion topped with fresh berries. A good standard creme brulee.
-Churros- i had high expectations for these since I had just seen Samantha Brown dipping churros in chocolate in Spain. haha. They weren't bad.",2010-09-15 19:42:51

Employees came around with drinks and sauces to sample and there was a woman their doing complimentary henna tattoos. I started with the Mango lemonade - it was delicious!! I would go back just for that. We also tried the Mango Kulfi. It was also very good. We got an order of the samosas and they were delicious and perfectly baked. For dinner I had the chicken biryani which was perfectly cooked under a piece of naan bread. A friend and I also split a chicken wrap, which was very very good. Everything was delicious. And the owner came around multiple times to make sure everyone was happy and satisfied. I will most definitely be coming back here and can't wait to try more things off the menu!

ZFzqU3gcLJWVuvFlPnhU8w,7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,PL3cimEUfNHlenOGSOAdJg,5,3,0,0,"On my most recent trip to Vegas to celebrate my cousin's 21st birthday my entire party and I had the pleasure of eating here. This upscale sushi restaurant is the latest addition to the Mandalay Bay fine dining scene, which opened July 2013.

CONCEPT: Kumi is a collaboration between the Light Group and executive chef Akira Back (Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant & Lounge @ Bellagio). The restaurant's focus is Japanese sushi with a Korean twist, reflecting the chef's Korean background. 

VENUE: As stated earlier the restaurant is located on the Mandalay fine dining strip near STRIPSTEAK and Red Square. If you look at the floor you'll see the names of fish written in hiragana. The entrance seems very reminiscent of an entrance to a ryokan and is very inviting. Tables near the entrance allow you to people watch. The lights and back wall created an image of sakura blooming in the springtime.

SERVICE: The server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. All his menu picks ended up being loved by all. Towards the end it took a little while to flag him down to get the last order of sushi.

FOOD/DRINK: With the exception of the Dragon Bowl, for a party of 7 two orders of each of the following menu items were needed as one order wouldn't be enough for each person to try. Usually a serving can feed 2-4 people depending on what else is ordered. This is ultimately the only real con of this place: one signature sushi entree isn't going to be enough to feed one person. Those $$$$ in the listing are there for a reason; this is one of the most extravagant places I've eaten in Vegas. 

1. Dragon Bowl: their signature bowl drink normally meant for at least 2 people. Each person was able to have several sips. The bowl had one whole lemon garnish and two pineapple leaves as decor. Drink had at the very least pineapple and a good quality rum. 

2. Rock Shrimp Tempura (Sriracha Ranch, Micro Celery) [$16]: When I tasted this I was immediately reminded of Spanish patatas bravas as the sriracha ranch tasted EXACTLY like brava sauce and the tempura was crunchy yet light. I could taste the shrimp though the sriracha ranch flavor was strong. This is a very addicting appetizer and I could have easily eaten a bowl to myself. 

3. Hot Mess (Crab, Sashimi Poke, Screaming O Sauce) [$20]: The sauce was akin to a spicy teriyaki sauce but I could still taste the crab and the poke. The dish itself was spicy, but the sushi can still linger in the mouth and not burn your tongue. 

4. Pop Rockin' (Spicy Tuna, Crab, Salmon, Avocado, Pop Rocks) [$19]: This sushi is an example of an unusual ingredient in a dish (the Pop Rocks) that works VERY well and makes the dish stand out. The sweet Pop Rocks definitely add to the avocado and the spicy tuna/salmon. Flavor combination was just perfect.

5. Fireball (Crab, Cucumber, XXX Hot Kimchee Sauce) [$19]: Least favorite of the sushi but still quite delicious. Crab was soft and the cucumber had a texture very similar to pasta (which is why any ""pasta"" dish under 500 calories usually is just cucumber), but like my cousin's friend said, was one-dimensional. It was also the spiciest of all the dishes.

6. Crispy Pork Belly (Brussels Coleslaw) [$17]: As everyone was still hungry for at least one more roll my cousin's friend and I wanted to try a non-seafood sushi option. The pork belly was crispy and the sweet sauces at the top and bottom balanced the meat. This is another example of a perfect flavor combination and along with the Pop Rockin', my other favorite sushi dish.

My cousin had a birthday dessert dish that had mochi ice cream pieces, one for each person. Mochi was soft and fresh and the ice cream was a nice sweet touch to end several sushi courses. 

Considering I am a person that normally doesn't go out of the way to eat sushi and really doesn't like cheap sushi places, this was certainly one of the best meals I've had this year, one of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas and if I were to rank my top 10 dining experiences, this would certainly be in one of the spots. I look forward to the next opportunity dining here again.",2013-08-11 23:43:26

We did go back and the records section was the easiest section I have ever dealt with.  We walked in, they staff said we could have called in advance and they would have had the records waiting on us instead of us having to wait on the records but it really only took about 5 minutes and we were out the door with a nice little folder which contained a dvd of the pictures from the test and a written report.

This is by far the best facility of theirs I have been too and it seem to run like a very efficient business.

I intended to share the fried mushrooms, but that certainly did not happen. I am thankful for fresh mushrooms and tasty breading. Definitely not the overly frozen stuff that I'm used to. 

The philly fries were great - lots of meat and the flavor was delicious!

Sunday to Thursday 9AM to 4AM
Friday to Saturday 9AM to 5AM

Open even later than the bars. 

I stayed up late, just to eat PHO at past midnight in Canada. This is a second floor restaurant, so pretty easy to walk past if you don't notice the train symbol for the restaurant. Walked up stairs and thought it was pretty clean and had a huge menu book. By far, one of the most collective Vietnamese menus I have seen because they served pho, clay pot, seven course beef, salads, variety of spring rolls, Banh Cuon, etc... On top of that, they had an order form you would fill out like some dim sum places you go to. 

My past midnight snack consist of the following:
* Pho Dat Biet [XL Large $8.50 CAD, Large $6.50, Small $5.50] (3 of 5) - Decent PHO. Soup, noodle, and beef was ok. No complaints.

* Bi Cuon Shredded Pork Skin Rolls $3.50 CAD (3 of 5) - Decent spring roll. I don't always see this on the menu so it was nice to try it.

* Banh Cuon Cha Lua Steamed Rice Flour Rolls with Viet Sausage $5.00 CAD (3 of 5) - This was a surprise on the menu. We never see it in SF so we had to order it. It was a great deal for $5.00 CAD. Almost like a salad dish. Too bad the rice flour roll was a little soggy and the lettuce was a little rusty. But still for $5.00, a great appetizer dish on top of the already ordered PHO.

Large menu and open late night. Great place to grab a hot PHO after the bar or for a quick Viet snack bite.",2013-03-17 00:54:00

They charge extra for soy milk, and did so when it pushed the price over the $4 dollar Indie Coffee Passport limit. The service was indifferent and the soy latte was okay, but wasn't spectacular.

It was also very noisy, but other than that it was a really nice event.

It was a set 5 course dinner. Scallop appetizer with bok choy and shitake mushrooms (excellent), lobster consomme (mine was almost cold, my least favorite dish), frisee salad with goat cheese (very good), Bison ribeye (excellent) and a chocolate trio (excellent). All 5 courses were paired with Cakebread wines. They were pretty small pours, maybe 2 ounces. Sometimes they would come back for a little extra and sometimes not. 

We always enjoy Hanks every few months for dinner but more often for their happy hour. I mean who doesn't like half price martinis?? I hope they decided to have more of these wine dinners.

WoW! What a TREASURE!

You know it's good when there's Japanese people eating there, yet it's VERY ""American Friendly"" which is something that most Asian restaurants aren't.

What I mean is that you'll feel very comfortable ordering food here even if you have no clue about Japanese food. When you walk in there's a huge glass display featuring replicas of their most popular products. There are also well crafted booklets available which show and explain each item. There's also video monitors that show the various offerings as well.

You won't have to 'guess' what each item is. It's very well shown and explained.

Their specialty is Udon, which is a soup featuring thick noodles. There are many varieties, mixed with different items such as veggies, eggs, and meat. Rice bowls are also a tempting offering, and there are sides including, but not limited to various tempura and seaweed wraps ('sushi'... sort of).

It's served cafeteria style, meaning you line up with a tray and order. After paying you bring your food to a table.

They also have an outstanding selection of soft drinks including an unusual one called Calipo. If you're adventurous but don't like the idea of ordering a drink that you don't know if you'll like, this is a great place to try it out because the drinks are bottomless and self serve. Free drink with Yelp check in, too!

Fantastic, authentic Japanese food at a low, low price! (Kake Udon, 2 Tempuras, and a beverage for under $10)",2018-03-11 12:40:43

Restaurant is nice with great service. However food is just a OK.

Appetizer:  
Goat cheese, eggplant with mushroom - The combination was nice however it was sweet. So it was not my cup of tea.
Salmon Tatar - Not a bad dish, but not so impressive. Portion is small

Main: 
Skate fish with risotto - The fish was cooked beautifully. However, it tasted so spicy. It has too much spices and black pepper, so you couldnot ever taste the freshness of the fish.
Grilled squid - Squid was nicely grilled. However, it was salty. Garnish was poor so that there was no other flavor in the plate other than just the squid. 

Dessert: Desserts are not too bad but portion was quite small.

I guess pros is that they have excellent sparking water from Portugal. Both me and my bf love that so much. 
They has a great selection and tasty in house bread. And the quality of the Oliver Oil that goes with the bread was very good! 

I really hope they could improve the seasoning of the fish.",2016-07-11 20:57:11

Do not expect much service from this pizza place. I am not sure if it was a language barrier or the male cashier was just grumpy.

District One is more upscale than your normal Vietnamese restaurants.  Love the ambiance and how spacious it is!  The booths are huge! Big enough to fit 3-4 people on each end.  They also have plenty of tables to accommodate bigger parties.  This has always been a favorite when planning big party dinners.  

I've tried a number of appetizers here, but I've stayed true to ordering one entree off the menu, and that's Bun Bo Hue.  On the menu, it's listed as, ""Hue Spicy Beef Noodle,"" and it comes with beef shank, pork loin, and hue pork roll.  It's soo good!  It's unique in the way that it doesn't come off as oily and you don't have to sift through the spices to get to the broth.  Add some lime, cabbage, herbs, and you're good to go!  I rarely ever finish a bowl of pho, but time and time again, i see the bottom of the bowl whenever I'm here.  

They also have good appetizers as well!  I enjoy getting the chicken wings, oysters, and spring rolls.

They offer Vietnamese beer and fresh coconut juice!  They also have different specials each night.  The last time I was there, they offered shigoku oysters for $3.50 each.  And also, Happy Hour is from 5-7pm and 12p-2am!  It's a great place to come for late night eats and being able to enjoy everyone's company!",2016-03-04 04:38:10

The concept is great here; you order, get your number, and the food comes to you. Or you can go to the bar area for drinks. Table seating arrangement is communal seating, so it can get quite cozy with your neighbors. Menu is also very impressive with tons of sausages ranging from more unique meats like kangaroo to your standard selections. There are also tons of beer and alcohol to choose from, which is perfect with this kind of meal. 

Went with normal selections in bratwurst and Oktoberfest sausages. One in curry style and the other in a bun, with an order of the infamous duck fat fries. 

Sausages were nice and simple tasting. Not a whole lot going on, good amount of meat, not too fatty. Proportions are all right. Grilled well. I really enjoyed the currywvrst. Those of that are not familiar, should know that this is tomato based. So it's like ketchup with curry powder, it's not curry curry. It's sweet and tangy with the fragrant-ness of the curry. I had this in Germany and would say it's authentic. Fries are also great, but could be a tad more crispy and were dark tasting (due to being cooked in duck fat). It's like borderline burned in a totally OK way. Wvrst flavored dipping sauce didn't do much, it's like some kind of chipotle with other spices. Mayo is really strong here.

I really do like the environment here; it's like a cafeteria, it's open concept but the music is utterly being blasted overhead and everyone is talking so loud as a result - you can't even hold a conversation or eat in peace.",2017-04-15 03:36:25
_gmcSixZBt2r-dkiS60D-A,uch01q0I89VjLtfHXR5r-A,AFgPDQm_pczo5uV3yQBgwg,2,6,4,1,"Sorry but cannot give this place the ratings everyone else is going with. Here is my experience.  Noon on a Friday.  Staff was nice but still figuring out themselves and the menus.  It is a walk up order and they bring the food to your seat.   The menu was not displayed, the specials board was unreadable and the only thing we could read was one small menu on the counter with the ""available items"" highlighted.  Approximately 75% of the menu was available.

We ordered poutine, a Cobb salad, a crave club and a sweet Caroline.  I had to go over to the bar to order my beer. Which was $7.60 for a 12 ounce on tap of Blue Moon. 

We took a seat inside, and the trouble began. We immediately noticed a significant amount of Gnats/flying insects all around us. At first we thought it was just a few annoying bugs by us so we killed them but they kept coming.

So we decided to change tables. We thought if we sat outside where it was slightly windy it would knock the bugs down and we wouldn't have an issue. So we sat outside for all of two minutes before part of our food showed up and it was clear that it was not going to get better. The waitress asked if we would rather sit inside. We said yes and she helped us into the restaurant.

We sat at a different table inside and the problem continued. At one point there were five Gnats on or in my beer. They were all over the table and my wife's arms. My son had trouble eating because it seems like every time he went to take a bite there was either a fly near him or on his food or about to go in his mouth.  we could not stay any longer with the amount of flies around us. A number of the staff came up and asked us if everything was okay and when we said no they said ""oh sorry you have a lot of fruit flies at your table."" It seemed like they were familiar with the situation but could not really do anything about it. Maybe closing the bar windows so that flies don't get inside the restaurant would be a good start.

If that was the only issue we probably would give three stars. But when my wife was getting ready to leave we asked for to go boxes and they said ""sorry we don't have to go boxes"" so they gave us aluminum to put across the top of our trays. Then we recognized that we haven't gotten our poutine yet. So we asked about our poutine and they questioned whether we had actually ordered it. We had to show them our receipt even though we were one of only a few customers that had recently orders.  They brought the poteen out about five minutes later. My wife had already left the restaurant because the bugs and service issues were overwhelming.

So we took the food to the car and finished eating in our car. We then found out that our son's salad had come without any dressing but we didn't want to go back into the restaurant so he just ate a dry Cobb salad.
With all of that said the food in the car was pretty good. The poutine was okay and the two waffle sandwiches were very tasty. my son liked his Cobb salad even though it was dry. 

Overall the staff tried to accommodate us but wasn't able to, the bartender was very nice and brought me a different beer that I had to drink extremely fast just so flies didn't get in it. The food was good but we had to eat it in our car. I can't give it more than two stars but maybe they'll work some of the ""bugs"" out and it will be better. We may try again in a few months.",2015-02-13 19:43:52

The atmosphere was great, with good tunes and a busy patio on a beautiful Friday night.  I noticed that it was a DJ spinning which is great for local DJs.  While the sidewalk isn't huge, they make good use of it with the patio in the heart of downtown.

Our waitress was great, especially considering how busy it was on Friday night.  She was perky, attentive, made good suggestions and really knew the menu.

We started with the fresh mozarella again - this is an absolute must, it's so fresh and tasty.
I ordered the summerlicious menu:  Panzanella Soup, Potato Parmesan Crusted Snapper, Tiramisu.  My boyfriend ordered the Pomodoro pizza.

Everything was delicious.  I took the Tiramisu home b/c I was so full after the mozarella, soup and snapper.  The pizza was incredibly tasty.  It comes in an oval shape which I thought was interesting - the waitress explained that they hand stretch all of the dough and the really cool pizza scissors are imported right from Italy.  

When I went to the bathroom I noticed there was a nice private balcony area upstairs - perfect for private events.  

I was thoroughly impressed with the customer service.  The manager came to introduce herself and comped our meals and one drink.  She came back after our meal to make sure everything was up to our standards and thanked me again via email the next day.

We started with some delicious naan and a variety of dips. The mint and mango? chutney were a highlight of the meal.

I had the Papdi / Mango / Watermelon Kachumber Salad which was refreshing but I wasn't sure that the onion seed dressing really suited the salad.

Flavor is good, but not the best in this part of town.  Price is about average, but the volume you get doesn't keep pace with the reigning value king in this department.

I ordered the tripe, tendon, beef ball etc., the beefy grab bag or P1 on the menu.  The brisket was good.  The meatball had a very strong taste but had too much of a potpourri flavor to it for my tastes.  There was only one piece of tendon, the right amount of tripe, and plenty of the other meats.

I will be back to try the vermicelli and probably another item.  They have tons of seafood and I think this is their specialty.  This specialty doesn't make this my go to pho place, so purely on that dimension see some of the places I have 5 stars.

I came in with two objectives:  get information to help me decide whether or not to finally bite the bullet and switch to Mac after being a PC person all my life, and see if I could get my iPhone repaired (yes, the ubiquitous water damage story...dropped into an unsuspecting - but clean, I swear! - toilet).

The store was packed as only an Apple store on a Sunday mall afternoon can be, humming with people being dazzled by cool technology.  Still, I was approached within 30 seconds by a clean cut and smiley guy in blue, ready to tell me whatever I wanted to know and sell me on the myriad coolness of Mac.  This guy spent a full 45 minutes with me, patiently answering questions and giving me a mini-lesson on programs for my laptop and my iPhone.  He also scheduled me for an appointment the next day at the Genius bar to see about my phone.

I left without buying, but seriously impressed.  The next day, I returned for my genius bar appointment.  I was seen within 5 minutes of entering the store (still packed with a long line, but my name was called on time) and the new smiley clean cut guy in blue was kind and helpful to me.  He ended up giving me a brand new phone, because the damage to mine had been minimal - something he clearly did not have to do.

Once you walk in there is a display case filled with bowls so you have a visual of what they look like. There are also menus for you and there's usually someone that greets you when you first come in and asks if it's your first time. If it is, they'll explain the process to you but it's simple enough. Grab a tray and let the person working know what number you'd like then grab as much tempura as you want. Plenty of seating and workers are super helpful. 

They offer extra noodle options for $2 more I believe. They make the noodles fresh and sometimes you can see them making it in front of you! The tempura is made fresh. I highly recommend the soft boiled egg and shrimp tempura. The sweet potato tempura was just eh. I think it could have been cooked a bit longer. 

My go to is the niku udon since it has beef and the broth is light, not too salty. I've also added the miso garlic pork belly bowl to my niku udon and thought the pork belly was too salty. I was expecting sort of like a braised fatty piece but the pieces were very thin and on the chewy side. My friends enjoyed the curry udon and seafood tomato cream.

I came here with my good friend Ree, after scouring yelp for a good place near by, we settled here for for dinner. I had a great time. :) 

I was STARVING when we entered the small resturant in a strip mall in Tempe. We immediatly ordered some tea and the Chicken Satee. I had the lemongrass tea, which was AMAZING btw... and my friend ordered the Thai (chai) tea and didn't care for it. I thought it kinda sucked that they didn't have free refils, but I guess that's a smart move considering the fact that they serve crazy spicy food! and can ... make more money! :P

Looking over the menus, I loved how you can choose your dish and then choose which type of protien for it to be cooked with, you can choose chicken, pork, beef, seafood or tofu. My We placed our order and had a good time. We waited quite a while... a little too long, considering the place was half-full. 

Finally our food came and it was quite the event. My friend ordered the sizzling beef and it came out still sizzling on a hot iron plate, think Thai Fajitas. They were good but after a while my friend couldn't finish it because it was so sweet! I had a bite and I thought it was good, but I could tell it was a little on the sweet side. My dish wasn't as extravegent, but still good! I had the spicy noodles with Chicken. It was crazy yummy! Nice and spicy, i felt the burn occasionally in the back of my nose... amazing. 

We ordered dessert from the not as gracious waitress, but I guess it's okay... she wasn't rude... just not very happy to be there. The dessert was good. I had the warm purple sticky rice with coconut ice cream topped with chopped peanuts and my friend had the fried bananas with coconut ice cream that was also topped with chopped peanuts. I loved mine, it was this perfect combination of warm and cold and sweet and creamy with a lil zing of salt from the peanuts which completely changed the profile of the ice cream. I was in heaven! :D my friend's dessert was also great. The fresh bananas were wrapped in what I think if rice paper and deep fried to a nice crispyness, it was sweet but not too sweet. a great ending to the meal.

I would love to see some simple classics like cheese danish, maybe even a donut, done Lola style.

The good news, I was greeted warmly and promtly when I walked through the door. The lady running the front could tell I was a newby and offered me a sample of the pho broth. The bad news, she was not able to answer the question I had about the broth having anise or licorice in it. I don't think it does but to be safe, I went with the ramen instead of pho.

The good news, they have great ginger lemonade here. The bad news, it costs $3.95. More good news, I got a few refills at no cost and even took it with me.

Good news, portions are large here. You pay a bit but you get a lot. I was surprised at how large the bowl of ramen was. The bad news, it wasn't my favorite ramen. The broth was OK but needed a little help. More good news, they give you sriracha, hoisin, sambal and pickled peppers to spice things up. I used some of the peppers and hoisin. 

Good news, the beef in my ramen was plentiful and tender. The bad news, there were a couple of pieces that were too fatty for my liking. I pulled off what I could. And the meat was cut thick. I prefer the beef in my ramen to be thin sliced.

The good news, there was a lot of noodles (which I've been craving despite the summer heat) and fresh MUSHROOMS (which if you know me you know I love). The bad news, there wasn't much more than this in the soup.

The good news, service is great here. The staff know their regulars to the point they ask about events in private life. This kind of neighborhood business shows its true colors in the way it treats its customers. The bad news, some of the stellar customer I recieved was due to errors being made. First, the beef in my ramen was cooked in the wrong broth so they had to re-make it. That took a few minutes but they kept me in the loop. There was another customer in there who was seeking a refund for an error she received and they accidentally refunded my card so they had to re-run my card. The silver lining here, for the inconvenience, I was brought a bowl of ice cream on the house. Their corn cheddar ice cream was recommended to me. It did not disappoint. Sweet and corny with a hint of cheese. I would like to taste a pinch of salt in there for balance but it is otherwise solid.

Some of the issues seemed to stem from the fact that the owner had gone home sick today. The staff working were trying their best but struggling in certain aspects. Like running a ship without a captain. They'll pull through with a little focus.

If I come back again in the future I want to try the Drunk AF Noodles. And I would not be opposed to trying the Big Wang sandwich. The menu isn't huge but there are a few interesting options left for me.",2017-07-13 02:56:53

They had a sign saying 30% off, but when we got closer, the lady told us buy one get one free, so 50% off.  We picked two different trays, but both around $12.5 each. At the register, we asked her for a miso soup, and she was glad to give us a bowl.

End of the day specials are the norm/standard for these sushi stores, so this deal wasn't a surprise, but the ""service"" really stood out - she was really helpful and friendly, much more than your average place.

Sushi itself was standard, food-court quality, not too great, but satisfied decently.  Ingredients seemed fresh, and the quality was definitely below what you would expect at a sushi restaurant.

It was an okay deal for 50% off, but otherwise, I wouldn't buy this sushi during peak store hours.",2014-12-26 21:22:08

Went here on a Sunday afternoon for some me time and some R&R and some serious nap time. 

There's one large jacuzzi with a overhead sprinkle of water (shower). That was the least hottest/warmest area. You can sit there 15-20 minutes and you'll be fine. 

The dry sauna, is seriously dry. Jut hot enough to make you sweat vigorously.

The wet sauna is my serious fave. Eucalyptus wet sauna? Why not?! It felt refreshing, minty, hot/wet, and when you get out of the sauna, felt like you've been rejunivated (sp?)

The shower mist room was kinda awkward because once you walk in, you just stand in the middle and let the shower rain on you. No seats. Just standing.

I stopped in today for lunch at 12:15pm and was greeted by the hostess.  I was seated immediately and Demetrius, the first of three folks who waited on me, was at my table simultaneously.  He explained the RW options and took my drink order.  Upon returning with my drink, I let him know that I was going to be going with the $30 option.  He explained the way the restaurant works and released me to the salad bar.

The salad bar is indeed quite extensive.  It's nice to see some non-traditional items on a salad bar like asparagus, pancetta, and corn mousse.  Prior to leaving for the salad bar, Wuile (pronounced Willie) dropped off some tiny rolls and crocquettes(sp?)   I enjoyed everything I had off of the salad bar, save for the corn mousse.  That wasn't what I was expecting.

While working thru my salad plate, Wuile came back with tapas consisting of polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas.  It was all good, with the potatoes being tops.

Finally, I flipped my coin and waited for the meat parade to begin.  I did have to wait a bit for someone to come around my table.  Apparently, I was getting passed up by the higher end meats, but I didn't realize that until later in the meal.  I did quickly receive some lamb, and then some flank steak right after that.  The lamb was good, but I thought the steak was better.   Demetrius came by to see how I was doing and to ask if I needed anything.  He asked if I had tried the pork yet and I said no.  He pulled out what appeared to be an iphone and placed an order for me for the pork, as well as the top sirloin.  In just a few short moments, gauchos were on the scene providing some tasty proteins.  The pork was a little tough, but the sirloin was good.  I finished up my meal with some chicken and one more go at the flank steak before throwing in the towel.

Service was fantastic.  There was another gentleman named Matthews who also helped out at my table.  My water glass was never more than half-empty.  They made me freel like a rock star.",2012-07-29 20:02:04

Next, Friday 11:30AM, no line. This was nice. But the menu is super extensive so I can see how taking a few minutes to decide what you want will be helpful. Not sure if they have hand held menus because for someone with bad eyes like me, that would be helpful.

Lastly, got the Shaka Surf. It was good! My salmon/fish portion was a little small and I was definitely left with rice to spare. I like that their house sauce has a kick to it and it's very tasty. Not a huge fan of all the veggies you can opt for so I just put lettuce and seaweed on top. Anyhow, I'll have to come back and try something else soon.

I ordered the Philly.  Even though it's called ""The Philly"" it's not a Philly Cheesesteak.  It is a roast beef sub done Philly-style...with home made cheese sauce (better than whiz), grilled onions and grilled mushrooms.  I got mine wet, crunch, and without onions..

I have to say that this was a damn-near perfect sandwich.  The roast beef was tender and seasoned perfectly.  The cheese sauce was rich and delicious.  And the bread was quality bakery bread.  And it wasn't hard or dry in the least.  I think some people are assuming the bun would be some crappy hot dog bun or soft sub bun, but its not.  Its crusty and sturdy.  And it needs to be...especially if you get your sandwich wet or soaked.

Either way, you're gonna want to have a fork & knife and plenty o' napkins because at some point, unless you can down this monstrous sandwich quickly, the jus-soaked bun is going to give out on you.

Loved the sandwich, loved the atmosphere, and the chef/owner was super nice.  I'll be back.  I just wish it wasn't so far away from where I live.

Let's start with the stars of the meal: the baba and the samosa pie. Finally. A baba ghanoosh that you can actually taste the eggplant!! Hands downs best baba I've ever had. So glad it was recommended to me by a friend. I could probably eat that for a meal, even though it's an appetizer. Second, the samosa pie is such a great price ($2.99!!!). It's a good-sized portion, but SO FILLING. Maybe it's all the starch, but I would 100% recommend. 

The okra stew was listed as one of the specials on the board, so naturally, we had to try it. I've had okra before, but never like this. It was an interesting, complex flavor with a bold tomato base. The beef kefta was delicious with the grilled veggies, but it tasted just like grilled beef without any of the typical seasonings I'd expected from a beef kefta. Wish I had opted for the chicken shish tawook. We had plenty of pita bread included for our food, which was great. 

Atmosphere is a bit calmer than I would expect, but they seem to keep very busy with customers who call in and pick up. I wouldn't come if you're in a time crunch to be anywhere though so keep that in mind. Service wasn't lacking, per say, but there were only two other tables occupied while we were there. 

Overall, it's not the best middle eastern food that I've had, but I would definitely come back in the future to try other dishes on the menu. (Already craving the baba ghanoosh and the samosa pie!)",2016-03-28 01:36:38

I had no clue what they were talking about but knew that there was a plastic bag in the glove compartment and asked them to check.  They reported they could not find what they were looking for and I should contact the car dealership too quite where this key is.  They said whenI get the key to come back.  When I got home I looked in the glove compartment and there was a plastic bag with what I though maybe the key they were looking for.  To be fair, I had taken stuff off my seat and stuffed it all in the glovebox including a purse and several sun glasses.  The plastic bag with the key was to the very back and I had to take everything out of the glovebox to get to it.  So my oil change was completed along with a free car wash, which the car needed.

The warranty company forced us to use Air Pro Masters, in my experience HVAC companies branch out to plumbing to make ends meet in the off season and therefore don't usually attract the brightest bulbs on the plumbing side.
The apartment in need of repair is empty and has various contractors coming and going performing the work they need to do.  Air Pro Masters refuses to show up unless there is someone there holding their hands the whole time the repair guy is there.  This would never be a problem with a respectable company.

First of all, really good vibe in there.  It's a walk up order so we placed:  fish taco plate with a side of rice and black beans, fish taco and shrimp enchilada plate and a kid's meal quesadilla.

Really bad food.  The parbroiled rice was undercooked, my pet peeve!  My hubby's soft tortilla was cold and crumbly...beyond the expired date, maybe?  The enchilada wasn't too bad.   My cutie pie's quesadilla was cold and the cheese was barely melted.  He took a couple of bites and decided he was done.  The imitation sour cream is one of the nastiest thing we've ever tasted...okay, one of.  We left with a weird film in our mouths.

It has some cool lighting effects built in under. They did a nice job with the tin ceiling details. 

The menu is creative and interesting. There were many items I'd eventually like to try. Tonight we had one of the Tuesday night taco specials where you get three for $8.50. We tried the pork. They were excellent! The kimchi slaw complimented the tender pulled pork and drizzle of sweet BBQ sauce. They were loaded with plenty of fillings. Then we had the burger off their menu upon hearing it played up. It was a large patty, but overdone for how we ordered it. Seems the people next to us had the same issue. The bun was fluffy soft and tasty. Their pickles were a nice accompaniment. The fresh cut fries were absolutely delicious and perfectly seasoned. I enjoyed their coleslaw as well.

One of the worse things you could do before walking into any car dealership was with an empty stomach. NOT A PROBLEM! As soon as we arrived, I was immediately directed to their free hot dog section for a quick bite. They also gave their customers free water bottles, sodas, coffee...you name it! They left us alone for 10 minutes and I basically inhaled the hotdogs. As soon as we told them what types of cars we were looking for, they drove us directly to a specific section of the dirt lot with lines of cars that are within our price range and features we were looking for. We test drove 2 of them. Within an hour, we were already sitting in the table negotiating the financing terms. 

We were able to walk out of this place within 3 hours. Prices were not exactly what we would like it to be. Nevertheless, they were very accommodating and professional throughout the entire transaction. They were not high pressure at all. They are direct, to the point, which is exactly the type of salespeople I would like to deal with.

The chicken and rice plate is incredibly delicious and downright feel good food.

If you eat just a spoonful of rice by itself, you'll know exactly the savoryness I speak of! The chicken is just as delicious and beyond tender. My one and only qualm with this meal is that the skin is a bit off putting since it isn't crispy. I personally just take it off as it's more soggy and rubbery than I would like. Now, there's 3 dipping sauces that come with the meal as well as a little pickled accoutrement. I have no idea what the three dipping sauces are called, but one is like a sweet soy, another sort of a spicy, tangy vinegar, and the last is the BEST savory, lemongrass, ginger, scalliony oil. I LOVE the last one, but the other two get some dipping action as well! Seriously though, the chicken dunked in the ginger scallion oil with a forkful of rice is therapeutic. The first time I went here I also ordered the iced coffee and cucumber appetizer. Both were yummy, but I have come back every time for the chicken plate.

The high roller Ferris wheel is located at the back of this area.

If you stay at this hotel, try to make sure it's in the summer as it has an amazing 21+ party pool with live djs, and relatively affordable daybed and cabanas. This past summer they started having night time entertainment at the pool. The back garden with flamingos and goldfish are still an attraction and are well maintained kept.

Tavern Grille also has some pretty good specials.  Saturday is half price burgers with purchase of a beverage.

I ordered the Ultimate Tavern Burger which is a half-pound cheeseburger topped with guacamole, bacon, grilled onions, green chiles and mushrooms.  Yes, the healthy one.  The burger itself was pretty good, but the onions were not remotely caramelized.  Tasted more like steamed onions.  Raw would be better if they're not going to do them properly.  Also, while the homemade bun was nice, it could not hold up to the toppings on this one.  Burgers are served with choice of french fries, tots, steak fries or a slaw.  The french fries were hot and crispy.

Service was mediocre at best.  We didn't see much of our server and food was delivered by someone else.  We were mostly through our meals before the server returned.  I never did get my soft drink, but was charged for it.  When I asked to have the charge removed, the server started to tell me I couldn't have the special unless I paid for her error.

I've been here several times, and have had mixed experiences with the quality of the food. For the most part it's been great, but sometimes the veggies (potatoes, in particular) can be under cooked or items like the samosas not cooked all the way through. My most recent visit was very good though! 

We ordered samosas, chole with rice and aloo with rice. The total cost was about $20, and we had leftovers. All items were vegan. The chole (chickpeas) was delicious. It had a nice medium heat that hit the spot. The rice was fluffy and abundant. The aloo was good, but the potatoes were a bit thick. More sauce, smaller potatoes would be better. The samosas were perfect - cooked to a crisp, warm inside and lightly spiced. I've had the veggie curry before too and loved it. The puri can be a bit greasy, but if you take it home and reheat it in the oven, it's fantastic.

The restaurant is small, and counter serve, but always clean. The service is always very friendly. The food is served on disposable plates. The packaging seems a bit much to me - like the plastic silverware is individually wrapped in plastic. Given that their target customers are probably environmentally aware, they might want to change to more sustainable service products. Also, the plastic water cups are pretty small for spicy food.

I strongly recommend they consider re-configuring the menu. I love that they mark what is vegan, and it's a fairly extensive menu for a small place. But, it can get very confusing/difficult to navigate. For instance, they could list all the curry options, then list how each can be served (with rice, with puri, with pav, etc.) - kind of more like a Chipotle-style. I like the details in the binder on each item, but I find myself going back and forth trying to figure out what I want. Also - I don't understand why their dhal isn't vegan.

We went in for a quick bite and that's pretty much what we got. We both ordered the ""street tacos"". I love that term. ""Street tacos"". Especially when served at a trendy gourmet type ""gastro pub"". It's the best oxymoron of modern cuisine. 

We also ordered the small quac and chips with salsa. The garden salsa is really bland and the ""hot"" variation isn't much hotter. The salsa verde was the best. Especially on those gourmet street tacos. I had the carnita, beef, and chicken tacos. Of the three, the pork was the best. The beef a little bland, and the chicken dried out and stringy. The guacamole was the furthest thing from traditional guacamole I've ever had. Oranges slices?  Weird. Can't say I was a fan. 

Anyway. Two appetizer orders of street tacos, chips and quac, an iced tea and a coke = $30 bucks and still hungry. 

Not sure if I'll go back. I get the ""gastro pub"" business model. I just don't drink enough to appreciate it much anymore. If I did still drink like I used to, I would have found the food unquestionably delicious.",2015-05-08 23:46:45

WTF was I thinking? Trying to rationalize my stupidity I'll say this is the price I pay for convenience as it is close to work and with a short lunch hour you do what you have to do. But all that money got spent and for what? Boring food. In 3 hours I will have forgotten about what I had for lunch. 

And since I'm in whine mode let's roll with it. I don't mind a place making money but $3 for iced tea is what I'd pay for a bottle at Kauffman Stadium back in Kansas City and we all know stadium pricing is ridiculous. As for the vaunted crust, the same stuff is used to make the Stromboli and it's not all that. And the pizza sauce if you like to taste tomatoes is ok, but it really needs some spices....

The bottom line: I need to go exploring other places to eat and kick myself out of food ruts like crappy strombolis. And who in the heck puts salami in a stromboli? Bleech. That's what I subbed out, give me my black olives and tomatoes, keep the pepperoni and mozzarella. At least the server working today was smiling and was running her rear end off, and the LVMPD gang unit came in which was interesting.

Unlike our prior awful experience with a BMW  Chapman dealership on Camelback it really took a lot for me to even consider buying anything from this group. 

We arrived on wet , cold day, and unlike every other dealer that had us schlepping around a lot   with the kids / carseat in tow ,   he brought the cars to us under their roof.  That's how to start to make a sale right there:)   I have a height problem, stubby legs, long torso and cars with sunroofs rarely fit me. Sadly car companies like to  force them on you coinciding with the kind of features I wanted,  e.g , Nav, power seats only come with a sunroof the alternative being a spartan item  that replaced all the toys with swathes of plastic. He went and looked at the options and quickly told us that it didn't exist and better yet didn't then try to shove us into another vehicle that wouldn't have fitted our needs.

The menu was large and they had several healthy choices. I ended up getting the eggs and bacon meal which came with a choice of toast (with a variety of bread options), a biscuit or scone. It also came with a very small bowl of fruit and these delightful hash browns that had some sort of cream cheese substance in them. The meal was very good and I can't wait to have it again.

Brew Tea has seriously got it down, from drinks that are made upon ordering with REAL teas (not powder!!) to their soft fruity crêpes.

Sweetness of your drink can be adjusted, on a scale of 0-4, with 4 being 100% sweet. I always tend to get my drinks less sweet, and they ensure that its just as you like it. Rose milk tea and Hokkaido milk tea are delicious. Taro slushes include a generous scoop of real taro pieces right on top. 
I have to stop myself from chugging my whole cup at once.

My friends and I find ourselves always going back here because of the value. There is a ""Night Owl"" special here that begins at 10:00pm and goes until closing at midnight. For about $10-$12, you can have AYCE KBBQ. Personally, I only go here for the Night Owl special. Items in the Night Owl AYCE menu include: 

- Protein: beef, chicken, squid, pork, fish
- Veggies and sides: bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, kimchi, radish, tofu
- Desserts: ice cream (green tea, mango, red bean)
**I might have missed some items**

The food is decent for what you pay for. For the AYCE meals, the entire table has to get AYCE. I've been here a few times where they made some exceptions and others at my table didn't have to get AYCE.. but for the most part, the entire table has to get AYCE. The AYCE menu works through filling out small pieces of paper and handing them to the servers. You can fill out as many of these as you want. Desserts aren't on these sheets and can just be ordered through the server. I've never ordered the other non-AYCE items on the menu, but I assume they are of similar quality to the AYCE items.

In terms of the establishment, I personally don't find it the cleanest or the nicest. It's one of those establishments where I feel the need to wipe down my utensils and plates before eating (this might just be me!). The service is quite good here - no complaints with this.

The salsa was very bland and extremely thin. I like my salsa thick and chunky. The chips were good however. We started off with a cheese crisp and a side of guacamole. I liked how the cheese crisp came with a side if diced green chilis but they were cold. Would have been much better if they would have cooked them onto it. The guacamole was alright however I found myself adding a bit of salt for flavor. There were three of us and we ordered a 1/2 pound of shrimp and a 1/2 pound of chicken. They really skimp on the bell peppers. You only get one little slice on the top and it's not even grilled in with the rest of the onions. In my opinion bell peppers are a normal part of fajitas - not an afterthought. The homemade tortillas they serve you are good although they are much bigger and thicker than they used to be. I definitely do not like that change. I prefer smaller thinner ones so you can eat more of them since I like to mix them up and have a different variety of toppings on each one.

I love that she is always investigating other and new products in order to find the best thing out there for her clients.  And her facials...I have NO idea what the heck she does that is so different from the others, but my skin is positively GLOWING for at least a week after I get one of her amazing facials.  I have extremely sensitive skin on my face and was SO nervous about letting yet another aesthetician put stuff on my face that could potentially give me hives/rash etc again...but Leslee listened to my concerns, and told me about the products she planned to use and even double checked a couple of the items to make sure they would be gentle enough for me...and I have never had such beautiful, radiant, healthy looking skin after she was done.  Her facials are positively addictive!

She is the NICEST girl you will meet too.  Not like your typical hoity-toity, snotty salon chick.  VERY friendly and sweet.  You instantly feel comfortable around her & you know she is not passing judgment on you in any way.

2)This is a USTA affiliated facility yet they don't even have scorecards? Yeah that can lead to some issues while playing.  My partner and I are seriously considering bringing our own as in heat of battle sometimes you can forget things.  They have stupid chairs overlooking courts but no drink holders or scorecards...um..yeah, ok, that makes sense.

I so want to fall in love with this place - partly for the agrarian atmosphere (it's conjoined with Agritopia), and partly because everything on the menu sounds so appetizing!  But with a few exceptions (garlic fries, strawberry lemonade), the food has been a let-down.  My last time here, I had a sonoran dog and a side of fried green beans.  The hot dog was just ok; flavor wasn't outstanding, and there was so much sour cream on it that it cooled off the hot dog and other toppings pretty quickly.  I couldn't taste much bacon at all.  The green beans had a wonderful garlicky aroma, but were very greasy and too heavily breaded.  They quickly turned limp from their own steam as they cooled.  I also tried some regular (not garlic or sweet potato) fries and onion rings.  The onion rings looked beautiful, but the onion was undercooked, and the flavor was bland.  Similarly, the french fries were bland, not particularly crispy, and needed salt. 

I love the outdoor seating under the beautiful old trees, but I feel the prices here are a little steep for the quality of food and the fact that you're eating off of disposable everything (it generates a huge amount of trash; I saw an employee emptying an overflowing trash can when I arrived, and emptying the same trash can -- now overflowing again -- when I left).",2013-11-08 03:41:49

Come here before 11:30 or after 1:30 to take advantage of the special pricing. You order on a paper menu that also has English on it and this is not a traditional cart based dim sum experience (although they did have some extra items on the carts).

We ordered 14 plates and here were my notes:
- Food was hot and fresh
- The bean curd roll was amazing
-  Sesame glutinous rice balls were really good. The custard inside was melted like an sunny side egg yolk
- Felt there could have been more fried doughnut rice roll, there was only a stick or two
-  Steamed rice was better than average 
- Har gow/siu mai/chicken feet/beef balls etc were standard 
- Total price out the door was $50 for four people, pretty decent (we were all full and took some home too)

Service was prompt, our tea was refilled without any problems. We didn't need to wait at all as we arrived at 11am.

Since it was a Thursday night it wasn't that busy so there was no need for a reservation. (On a Friday or the weekend I'd make a reservation.) We were seated quickly in a nice large booth. Since Dyanna had been here prior we asked her what she liked. For our drinks I ordered a Hurricane, which was super strong, but still tasty. The birthday girl ordered a Mojito and Dyanna had a Spicy Bloody Mary. It was a hard choice for appetizers. King's has a huge menu and even sushi!! Yay! So we picked the Shrimp Taquitos and a Trojan roll. Both items were excellent. The taquitos had a whole shrimp in each one and they were topped with queso fresco and pico. Plus a side of guacamole. The taquitos had a really tasty spicy flavor and with the crunch of the shell it was a perfect bite. The Trojan roll was delish! It had tender spicy tuna. Mmmm! All three of us dug in. I would have been happy with just the appetizers, but entrees were still to come. Jessie ordered the seared scallops while Dyanna had the macadamia nut crusted salmon. Yummy! I ordered the seafood cobb salad with their house vinaigrette. It was the best salad ever! It had a row of chopped shrimp, scallops and crab. Omg amazing! The vinaigrette had the perfect flavor to enhance the seafood. It also was huge! 

Our waiter was on point, super friendly and very sweet. He answered all our questions and made sure our drinks were filled and that each course came out smoothly. The decor was relaxing and cool too. Lots of dark wood and vintage tiny tiles of black and white lined the floors. There is also patio seating which looks very inviting.

It reminds me a bit of my childhood as I had several friends and family actually live there.  Some of those houses are now trendy shops and restaurants, but I can remember a time actually being in them when people lived there.  Yes I'm THAT old.

But there's always character and charm in a street that seems to have a bit of history, narrow, tree lined and packed. It reminds me a bit of St. Marks in New York, although less busy.

Cafe La Gaffe is fittingly one of those charming places.  We came for the Summerlicious lunch, to which I've basically stopped going places with a summerlicious prix fixe (another discussion for another time).  This time around, the service was toot quick.  Beef Carpaccio, Grilled Salmon, and a Creme Brulee to boot were all decent, but nothing spectacularly memorable.  My only complaint was that the Brulee was obviously rushed.

We ordered 4 dishes: (1) a pork bone with pepper soup which came in a big pot. The soup was nice, it reminded me of those soups you would get at a typical Chinese restaurant for dinner but with a hint of white pepper since you would feel the kick of spice after a little bit. My parents thought the bones didn't have much meat in them (I mean, why would they, they are bones....). (2) HOMEMADE BBQ pork, I was a sucker for BBQ pork so I had to order it. The sauce was really sweet and would pair well with rice, but the pork had too much fat in them and basically was sliced pork belly with sweet sauce. (3) The Spicy beef... Holy Cow was that dish spicy. As soon as the server opened the foil wrap, all you see was beef covered with tons of dried red peppers and peppercorns. Beside the spiciness, you could also taste a hint of cumming which was really nice. However, it was just too spicy. (4) The restaurant's signature chicken rice. It tasted like... chicken rice! The rice was cooked with chicken oil and boiled in a clay pot. The chicken pieces on top were not too tough and quite tender. 

Overall, I would say this restaurant probably is better for ordering congee, wonton noodles, etc, but not dinner dishes as the food was not as great as people said. Not say that I wouldn't come here again for dinner, but it would not be my first choice.",2018-03-12 23:12:54

As for the main dish, surprisingly it was executed nicely.  Steak was prepared and cooked perfectly.  It is tender and juicy.  I think they also sear the corner to give smokiness of the steak.  Shrimp tastes frozen but I think it is the same case for majority of spots Chinatown.  I think their sauce is milder than New Hong Kong bistro so would be ideal for those who prefer lighter taste.

I thought I had bought some great seats because they were over $40 each, but when we arrived we weren't even in the lower section of seats.  Those seats were over $80!!  Outrageous!!  I can't stand sitting in the lawn at this venue because so many idiots smoke pot while sitting out there and you are forced to smell that disgusting smell for hours on end.

I ordered a curry beef dish and while this was my fault, I didn't know it didn't come with rice.  However, I was eating by myself and not many people eat curry without rice.  This was something the waiter should have picked up on this and told me it didn't come with rice.  

However, this wouldn't automatically get them two stars.  What really annoyed me was that asking for white rice was very confusing for them.  It took about 5 minutes for them to come to my table and then when I inquired another 5 minutes later, they said it was coming.  So they re-heat my food and then there is still no rice! I had to ask 3 times for white rice. Ridiculous.

In addition, this place is dirty (even though it is new).  Overall, there are much better pho places.  I'd rather to the Pho Mi 99 or Pho Queen city than this place.",2015-02-11 21:07:27

Everything that can be pink or white, is definitely pink or white! A relatively quiet place overlooking Yonge street, a good alternative spot from the busy Starbucks across the street and a bit more private due to take second floor location. Prices are average on the food, and a bit steep on the drinks, and everyone coming must order something! To be fair, seating is limited, and sitting around without purchase is just not the best patron etiquette. Fortunately there's no minimum purchase amount unlike some other places, so I count that as a positive.

Their desserts are very much items you can make at home or purchase elsewhere, but nonetheless they are well presented and priced pretty fairly. You'll find cake (La Rocca!), ice cream sundaes, waffles, parfaits, and the like - all with cute names or combinations that make everything add to the atmosphere. I got the nuts waffle to share, which is a regular waffle with a sprinkle of assorted nuts, accompanied by two scoops of ice cream - vanilla and cookies n cream. (NOTE: waffle orders can be split between two people and count as their required ""order per person"", yay!) The waffle was fresh, the nuts were a bit skimpy, and the ice cream was low quality. But it did come beautifully presented! No complaints on presentation at all!

Based on various other comments I gave their sweet potato latte a try. Their regular size is a ""small"" elsewhere, and I always forget a latte without the ""café"" part is really just a steamed milk drink. It smelled great and was piping hot when it arrived, and there was a faint sweet potato flavour that was enjoyable and unique. Unfortunately as I neared the bottom I found the ""grits"" of the sweet potato - as expected really on hindsight, and goes to show there really was something else other than milk and sugar. The bits were similar to sesame or peanut bits left over in your milk tea, so it wasn't terrible but for the surprise as much of it sank at the bottom and I didn't have a spoon to stir.

There's free wifi available and it worked pretty well, and many people were sitting around with their laptops working quietly.

Overall no complaints but really nothing special, a good hidden gem for those seeking the adorable cute experience and a quieter spot to catch up.",2017-10-20 13:57:32

The bibimbaps had a higher topping to rice ratio than I'm used to, but the variety of veggies were fun and I really enjoyed it.The spicy pork didn't seem spicy in the slightest, but that could be because I doused my own food in gochujang.

I have to give myself a little credit.  I usually hit the LVAC gym at Flamingo/215 at least 3 times/week.  IF i had no control, I would probably hit CBP at least once / week.  After all, burn a few calories, replenish them with pizza - makes sense to me !   But no, I've probably hit the place, at most, once a month.  Honestly, the main reason for the ""infrequency""  is there are tooooo many other places to try in the Valley.

I really dig the fact that you can pile on the toppings.  I really dig the fact that it only takes a few minutes for the pizza to be prepared/cooked/boxed.  I really dig the low prices ( under $8 given LVAC discount and sometimes lower given specials.)

I don't like that the crust does not hold up to the toppings ( then again, when you put a pound of meat on an 8"" inch pizza, you'll need to  add cement to the crust .)  I don't like that i rarely wait until i get home to eat the pizza.

Overall, I continue to be a fan.

I won't pretend that this is the greatest sushi EVAR - however, it's fairly fresh sushi, and that's all I ask for with my fish. 

In addition to offering a surprisingly lengthy menu of sushi rolls for such a small place, Sushi & Rolls also offers soups, standard Japanese eatery salads with ginger dressing, gyoza (which unfortunately has a tendency to be overlooked), and teriyaki and noodle based dishes. Diners who stop in have the option of ordering sushi, ordering a normal entree, or even picking up a sushi bento box that comes with a mix of what this place has to offer. I admittedly avoid the bento boxes because they tend to come with spicier sushi rolls that I don't like. But the rainbow roll and California rolls never disappoint.

Secondly, yeah, they give you a bunch of meat, but they charge $8.  If you go to any other gyro shop and ask for extra meat you'd get the same if you were willing to pay $8.

Third, their sauce is terrible.  It probably wouldn't be bad if it wasn't spicy, I wish they would have had normal sauce, and the spicy sauce, but they only have spicy.  I assume they put tabasco in it.  I'm not sure if that's the secret, but that's what it seemed like to me.

It's located at the top of the DELANO adjacent to Rivea. So a great spot to catch a pre or post dinner cocktail or three. I was lucky enough to get there in time for happy hour, so I tried a few of their signature drinks and was not disappointed! My best dining companion and Somm friend was able to join me for these cocktails, and unfortunately was given a little attitude by our bartender when he inquired about some Amaros...(even I noticed the tone). He was also told they only had one type of amaro, but upon further inspection of the bar contents we noticed his favorite Nonino Amaro that he would have preferred. I'm sure he and the bartender had some sort of weird booze knowledge dick measuring contest going on, but as an innocent bystander, I felt like I got attitude by association.

you get plenty of good proteins that, unlike other places, are not super greasy! And their prices are super reasonable.

I do not prefer salt in my dishes. Same for the salad, I got dressing on the side but decided to sprinkle ilt with lemon. And last but not least... their BREAD! Omg! Fluffy but not yeasty or heavy, seasoned but not super salted or fattening ... stayed pretty pretty soft hours after being served...

The answer is: we couldn't and we had to order all three (which, by the way, is tooooooooo much food).

My husband raved over the tender short ribs, served over creamy mashed potatoes, sautéed veggies, red wine reduction!   And, once again, we all had a hard time deciding over the sides and finally settled on ordering one of each:   bacon cheddar biscuits, candied jalapeño orange butter, the wood oven roasted beckett's bacon biscuit stuffing, and the spinach spaetzle, bread crumbs, pancetta (for which I would totally order a full meal of , but that's just me, as my husband and son where not quite as enamored with it).

Dessert, caused us much consternation and we were much more reserved...probably because we were such gluttons from the start.   May I say that if you are a bacon fan, YOU MUST ORDER the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel,housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter,
graham cracker.  Yes, literally it was two huge, thick strips of bacon dipped in dark chocolate - with a side of smores.  Personally, I just at the bacon and let my son eat the smores.    My hubby ordered the chicory coffee crème brûlée - which he enjoyed.

The line was just too ridiculously long to wait.  My bf and I decided to look around and see what else is available in the casino and found Marinelli's.  There was no line, intimate setting, and a fine dining restaurant.  

The hostess was very friendly and the smile on her face was just enough to think this might be a good place to celebrate mom's birthday.  Not only is there inside seating, but also patio seating.  Mom liked that idea and basked in the sunset lighting overlooking the majestic mountains.  

Our server was courteous and friendly enough.  One good thing about him is that he's not overly friendly.  Sometimes, that can get annoying.  We got served water immediately, olive oil with balsamic vinegar and bread to go with it.  After ordering, we received a complimentary plate of olives, salami, assorted vegetables, and parmesan cheese.  This was definitely a good starter.

Mom ordered their Spaghetti and Meatballs, Stepdad ordered the salmon, bf ordered pasta with beef, and I ordered Kobe Beef with risotto.  We also ordered two types of side salad: Caesar Salad, and garden salad.  The Caesar salad didn't have enough dressing on it for my liking.  I tasted mostly the romaine lettuce.  When all the plates arrived, all looked fantastic.  

Mom and Stepdad definitely loved their dishes, the bf said it was good, and mine... hmmm... I should've ordered something else.  It was my fault really.  I forgot I was in an Italian restaurant and in my mind, when I think of Kobe Beef I think of Japanese style and flavor.  The Risotto was too salty, and the Kobe Beef didn't have enough good seasoning on it.  It just didn't agree with my pallet.  It was also my fault because the server did ask me how I liked the food.  I didn't have the nerve to speak up and say how I really thought of it.  Needless to say, my full plate spoke for itself.  I couldn't finish it.

- The portions are very sizeable for the price (yes you pay $15 but you could easily split the regular-sized salads or bowls into two meals)
- My favourites have so far been the quinoa onion rings and the crispy squash tacos - both very delicious and consistently good
- The new phytosalad is delish (the 369 dressing is mmm) but the soba noodles were overcooked in my opinion (they aren't suppose to be soggy..) and for some reason they served this dish on a plate..Perhaps I'm just being picky but I do think dish choice is important to consider for dining experience. It's a great salad but it should be in a bowl like all the others! 
- I saw a strange bug on my taco's lime today eep! :S Thankfully I don't really need lime for my tacos but that is a little bit gross to encounter (I wish it was because the lime was so fresh from the garden!) 
- Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of Fresh smoothies or juices... I've gotten a number of different ones and they are always lacking balance in flavours.

Look for daily specials as they give you an upgrade to the size of the larger drink which is very filling.

We were taken back immediately and a doctor and nurse came in before we'd even gotten settled. The rooms are well sized and extremely clean and there are always kid friendly movies on TV as well as comfortable seating.,2018-08-20 01:42:17

We ordered the valentines special - salmon Benny with avocado hollaindaise sauce . mannnn oh man. It was delicious!! Just like a regular eggs Benny but w super creamy avocado sauce and smoked salmon ! Def our fav. 

We also ordered the general fried chicken and waffles cuz it Loooks sooooo good!! Almost every other brunch table had that dish. I'm a huge fan of CnW.. However this one was alright.. We were a little bit disappointed bc it only came with one piece of fried chicken and I thought the batter could have more flavor. Waffle was regular sized. The honey Tabasco sauce was also supppper spicy! So be careful!! You'll definitely need a sauce since the waffle is a bit dry but don't go too crazy. We don't eat super spicy food so our taste buds were prolly not used to being on fire.

Our server was good and kind.

The food was a huge let down in terms of flavour and being Italian.
2 of the popular options (osso-bucco and the mushroom ""ravioli"") were not available.

The Gorgonzola Fig was a huge let down, gave the impression it would be a bunch of small figs stuffed with gorgonzola and wrapped in prosciutto. Basically it was 1 piece of a small fig with a quarter oz of cheese and like 5 pieces of prosciutto around it.

Carbonara was so bland, undercooked onions, pancetta wasn't nice and crispy, no flavour. On top of that, clearly it was boxed pasta (not fresh),
Should have figured from the hundreds of boxed pasta around the kitchen.

The empanadas were great. I had a snafu, one of my chicken empanadas was actually vegetable so I sent it back and they corrected it.

The point is, most of the crap they sell falls apart after a few washings, but that's fine for their demographic, which is younger women and girls on a budget who want cute clothes that they will tire of after a few wearings anyway, so no harm, no foul.

Then, I called Sephora, who checked and found that the card had not been used, cancelled it, and sent me a new one (5 stars, Sephora).

Then, I called Forever 21, who checked, found the card had not been used, cancelled it. assured me no one could use it, but COULD NOT ISSUE A REPLACEMENT! WTF??!!  They KNOW the card was paid for, they KNOW they got my money, the KNOW no one can use the card, but I'm supposed to be satisfied with giving them money for nothing? I was outraged.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, but probably because we came in between lunch and dinner so I imagine we just missed the rush. We were seated by the entrance right by the host/hostess table and we could hear all the loud conversations of the recently out of school college kids who work there. Not ideal but you can't really blame them since it was a slow afternoon.

My husband and I each got our own pizzas. I got the Hawaiian and he got The Works, each around $15. The size of the pizzas were pretty large, but not large enough to share between two people. If you were to share a pie, I would highly recommend also getting appetizers. But getting a pie to yourself will probably be enough with maybe a few slices to take home. My favorite part of the pizza was the crust, which was thin, but not too thin, and crispy yet slightly chewy. Otherwise, the flavor was kind of average. For $15 a pie, I was expecting a bit more than average.

Tried the stuffed meatball. It was pretty good! Well seasoned and juicy. The basil on top added a nice fragrance. Accidentally ordered the app instead of the entree. 

Also tried the apple ravioli. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It just didnt work for me. For me I would prefer a buttery crispy type of crust but it was quite sweet instead. The caramel sauce was good but I think it would have gone better with a buttery crispy pastry.

The orange tofu is a favorite, but I'll go for the general tso is probably my favorite. They'll even make sweet and sour tofu (not on the menu) if you just ask them.

Also, the egg(less) rolls are allegedly vegan, so dig in! 

Final vegan note, the woman on the phone told me that she thought there was egg in the chow mein noodles, but if you're vegan you know how flaky people can be about whats in what so I'll definitely have to ask again some time.

So last Sunday rolls around and my husband suggests we go for brunch, really glad we did. We each started with a Drake Caesar (the classic one) but it had a really great punch of fresh horseradish that I loved. I prefer a celery garnish to the olives served here but overall the cocktail was excellent and the rim was nice and peppery. 

I struggled between ordering the Caleb Benny or the Bagel + House Smoked Salmon but went for the bagel in the end. I'm SO glad that I did. This is not your traditional long slices of smoked salmon, it's chopped up finer and has more variance in it's texture. Below the salmon was whipped cream cheese and above was a chow chow topped with alfalfa sprouts. The chow chow had the most wonderful sweet, tangy, pickled flavour to it. It reminded me of a sweet giardiniera. I've been thinking about the dish ever since - I even finished the massive portion. 

Husband had the classic benny and also almost finished his. He loved it and really appreciated the 'real' slices of ham. No deli meat here. Also the fresh cheddar biscuit was a welcome subsitute for an english muffin.

RbimVJM-1GiHM2zrclgnCA,cyuDrrG5eEK-TZI867MUPA,QAHqplESgDUGgih45W9J-g,4,1,0,1,"Our first time here.  It took us five years to get around to it with another couple who highly recommended it.  I have been disappointed with Frescos and some other supposedly wonderful steak houses; but reluctantly agreed to give Dressler's a shot.

Hardest part was finding the restaurant tucked away east of Uptown.  With going home traffic we made a lot of turns and there it was.  Fortunately it has a responsive valet and that was a relief.  

Dressler's has indoor and outside eating areas.  The outside was tempting as it has an very nice city view, but why sweat while eating unless you have to?  We went inside.  Our 6pm reservation made us early birds as there were only a couple of tables outside and only one other one indoors.  My negative suspicions were kicking in.

Seated, our server went through the routine and it turned out that he was just super.  For some reason my receipts say ""Tiffany"" but Tiffany was a guy.  Turns out it was Mathew.  I would ask for him next time.

Menu was straight forward.  It is a meat place, so since we wanted steak we were ready to go.

We had cocktails and the bar did an excellent job.  Wines by the glass were available so everyone was happy.  Went for appetizers, onion soup, calamari and Cajun shrimp.  The onion soup was judged by the ladies as so-so, but the calamari and shrimp were great.  Calamari were in extruded solid tube shapes.  Not seen before and questionable, but they were delicious.  My guy friends and I wolfed those down and then went for the Cajun shrimp.

The shrimp were in a chafing dish, hot and sitting in a very flavorful and rich sauce.  It was simply not just Cajun seasoning, but something more light and sophisticated.  With a small loaf of french bread it was a high point.  I could go for a this as a dinner option it was so good.

We ordered one unnecessary chopped salad, which all of us sampled.  It was just fine, but after the appetizers, we were questioning whether we had room for the Filet Mignons we all had ordered.

The meat came.  I was astounded that they were cooked exactly perfect.  Is that redundant? My medium had the by-definition warm red rare center and the tender meat around it was light pink to the slightly crisp edges of the meat.  Rare appeared to be wiggling across from me, but by then the Manhattans I was sipping were kicking in.

Mashed potatoes, just like mom's at home, were delicious and it was a good mound of delight to take in.  Asparagus was the veggie and there were other choices as far as good-for-you stuff goes.

The only down side was that the dime-glaze on the meat, and the mom's potatoes were very salty.  I wiped off as much of the glaze as I could to realize with excellent cut of meat, but I could only get through about one-third of the potatoes.  All of us at the table had the same judgement.

We told Mathew and the manager, not as a complaint, but just so they could be watchful for the heavy-shaking kitchen crew lurking in the background.  No, we did not want a complementary or reduced bill, just hope that no one else gets the same.

Just in-case, I recommend that you ask for the dime-glaze on the side.

The dinner was a 2.5 hour experience which was really a pleasure.  Good job Dressler's.  You can count on another visit from us.

When we exited, our car was parked immediately across the street from the front door and that was a true topper for an evening of great service, food and continual checking by management.

I will note that both dining areas were filled within an hour of our arrival and it was principally that evening full of business men.  Hot summer night and guys in coats and ties = business guys.  And it was not noisy.  We could talk at our table.",2017-09-30 11:41:29

Food taste and authenticity is more of my ""thing"". I had tried this place earlier as a coworker swears by this place ( Midwest American). I have really never been impressed or dissuaded enough to yelp about it. In all honesty I think that I should have tried their a-la carte menus which had a bunch of authentic (ask for the cantonese menu) dishes. However I decided to go for the buffet. 

Simply horrible is all that comes to mind. All of the dishes had that ""left out for several hours"" taste and texture. Both their soups were just horrible. All the items (of which only half of them were replenished) were americanized hurriedly prepared soaking in oil, dishes with chewy meat.The fried rice was rather decent; the only redeeming factor.

And today I visited their new relocated location on 7537 S. Rainbow Blvd (Rainbow exit off the 215), as the previous location has since been closed.
Bamboo Bistro comes highly recommended by my Vietnamese friend, who loves their Tri Color Dessert and their Sn Bò Nng (Grilled Short Beef Ribs). He comes here orders it to eat at the restaurant and 2 more of each to go for breakfast and lunch the next day.  Seems a little crazy, but after sampling them both for myself I can see that the obsession is well justified.  The Tri Color Dessert looks similar to the Tri Color Dessert served at other Vietnamese restaurants, but is actually an original creation of the owner. The taste is better, and you get mostly the goodies and not the ice cubes as fillers.  The same goes for the Grilled Short Beef Ribs, which is basically like the Korean Kalbi served in Korean restaurants or Hawaiian BBQ, but again it just tastes better.  My guess is that the quality of the beef ribs used is probably better, what it is marinaded in is also better balanced and tastier, and it also looks about 20% thicker than at other restaurants.  I didn't try anything else, but just based on these 2 items I will definitely be back for more.

The location is also better for Bamboo Bistro, as the business is doing well with a lot of steady customers coming in relative to the previous location.  However, with the restaurant being busy, they may need to hire additional help to service the guests in the front and maybe more cooks in the back too.

I got a chance to walk around the perimeter of the restaurant and it is so beautifully styled on the outside.  There are several outside seating areas.  Because it was a little chilly that night, there was a fire burning in the fire pit.  The restaurant is lovely on the inside.  the atmosphere is not very intimate in my opinion, but it is absolutely stunning and appealing all the same.

We had our drinks at the bar and were seated for our dinner service.  When going to an establishment like this, we both usually know what we want, definitely my friend wants a bone-in Filet.  I will generally order sea bass.  Unfortunately, they were out of the bone-in filet.  I actually called ahead to question the availability of the bone-in and they did inform me that they did not have any but we decided to go there anyway because we'd never been.  My friend ordered the bone-in Ribeye and I ordered the Sea Bass.  Oh, for the appetizer, we ordered the beets and double cut bacon.  Oh boy did we like the bacon!  LOL.  if you know me, that should come as no surprise.  

My seabass was just average.  My friend was quite unhappy with his bone-in Ribeye as it was somewhat too charred on the exterior for his taste.  I personally prefer a steak cooked rare/Pittsburgh blue/black and blue/basically cool rare.  I could never eat that.  The meat itself tasted average to me as well.

if I could give them 3.5, I would, but I can't give them a 4 because they didn't have 2 things we wanted from the menu on that day and we were somewhat underwhelmed by the tastes of the food.

they were, however, kind enough to comp us desert that night because we wanted things on the menu that they were out of and because of a couple other misfortunes that don't warrant discussing.  I think it was a cream cheese cake.

Definitely loved the popovers!  I wish I could bake that.  i wonder if anyone has ever made that recipe.  If so, please message me and let me know how it turned out!

When the rest of us entered we were not greeted by the host Gerardo. I approached him and asked if they had a trash can where I could throw an empty water bottle away. Without saying a word he took it out of my hand and walked away. 

My sister in law had been told we'd have a 15 minute wait before being seated. After waiting 20 minutes, we asked how long it would be. The hostess then said ""Oh, I can seat you now."" When we'd finally been seated the first thing we noticed was how empty the dining room was. No idea why there was any wait to begin with. 

Our waitress was Jazmin. Service was terrible. We were in need of refills and each time she was seen standing in front of the line playing on her cell phone. 

In fact, there was another table that came in after us and we noticed they waited 15 minutes before she approached them for drink orders.

Another major issue we observed was a male waiter exiting the bathroom and rubbing his nose. As someone who is being served food, the last thing I want is to see a waiter who is handling food rubbing his nose. Whether he washed his hands or not in the bathroom is now irrelevant because now they need to be washed again.

Had he been our server we would have walked out immediately.

She wasn't the only wait staff who was slacking though. It seemed none of them had any interest in doing their jobs with one exception - Lora Lee. 

More than once Lora Lee took care of our needs because our waitress wasn't interested. It appeared that of the entire staff, she was the only one working. She took care of her customers as well as others, and even had to tell the other servers to get the food out that had been sitting in the window. 

My party and I agreed that had she been our server, our experience would have been drastically different. If she's not a manager, she should be because no manager could be found and wherever they were, they weren't doing their job.

Food wise, we were all happy with one exception. Everything was cooked as ordered, flavor was good.

My 2nd experience happened this past weekend - Sunday breakfast at 10 a.m. As I pulled up in my car, I could tell the place was quite popular. I sensed a wait list. I walked in, put down my name and took a seat outside on of their benches. The wait wasn't long - perhaps 5 minutes - and I was shortly shown to my table for two. Few minutes later, my Breakest Buddy showed up. We had concluded to call this ""brunch"" since it was a compromise between breakfast and lunch time. In any case, breakfast foods were on the mind and my belly was ready. 

Coffee first, please. 

The waitress, you could tell, was rather busy. I didn't mind that, but I did mind her spilling my coffee each time she poured more. Her rush wasn't coupled with friendly pauses, and I felt like I was more of an inconvenience than a patron. In any case, we ordered ""brunch"" and chatted it up. It's not every day I roll out of bed before 10 a.m. on the weekend. This was a special occassion; one well worth it. But, sadly, not because of the breakfast. 

The eggs were rubbery and the muffin was hard to swallow without honey. The cottage cheese was good, but how can you screw up that? Yes, I ordered the Hot Body Breakfast. So sue me. My friend ordered panckakes with eggs and bacon. Only half was eaten. 

You know, there's something oddly charming about this place. It's a warm cafe, reminiscient of a small town mom & pop establishment. It probably is, and the fact that it's thrown near ASU makes it the preferred after-hang over joint. I can see how rubbery eggs and greasy pork would suit one's belly after a booze fest. But, it's not ideal for the belly without a drop of liquor coating the stomach lining. 

I used the bathroom, too. Talk about a tiny walkway stuffed with clutter, like high chairs and cordless vacuums. Again, it's charming in a home-for-breakfast kind of way. 

It almost reminds me of Shortcakes. Almost, although Shortcakes is in a train car and has, let's face it, the best after bar and in-the-mood-for-cheap-food appeal. Sadly, it's back near OSU in Stillwater. I miss Shortcakes. 

Harlow's wasn't memorable to me. That's probably why I've only been here twice in my life.

Note that there are not a lot of seats. The selection at Saryo reminds me of the other Japanese dessert chain in Toronto, but with less variety. I wanted to try their cakes but when I asked the staff what they recommended, he wasn't too enthusiastic with the cakes. He said the soft serve is the most popular. So I got the Hojicha soft serve. The hojicha flavour is there but just a bit sweeter than I would have liked. My friend tried both and she prefers the matcha soft serve over the hojicha.

The décor has a relaxed cosmopolitan feel, with the marble floors, leather/chrome chairs hosting the white tablecloth tables and has an airiness/openness to the restaurant.  Service is good, and several lovely items on the menu--specifically their aged steaks.  I will admit their wine selections are very good.  Started the meal with the Oysters Rockefeller, six large oysters with a creamed spinach and loaded (very heavily) with a hollandaise sauce--good dish but is a little on the heavy side.  Next was the Lobster Bisque.  This was a very nicely done soup, small pieces of lobster and the cream/sherry base was wonderful--outstanding soup course.  Moved on to the salad--Bibb Salad, with shaved vegetables, some smoked blue cheese chunks and a wonderful tarragon-mustard dressing, simple and light.  Next course was the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, this course was plated nicely, had a large grilled brioche that the Foie Gras was atop, accompanied with a blackberry jam and delicious pickled grapes.  Very good course--Foie Gras was excellent, grilled brioche was on the large side--could be halved.  My main course was the Filet Mignon, a 9 oz. wet aged steak--this was very flavorful and tender.  This was accompanied with a grilled artichoke and I had a wonderful bordelaise sauce (dry red wine, bone marrow, butter, shallots and a sauce demi-glace), also had a delightful jumbo asparagus with a garlic and lemon zest as a side vegetable.  All presented very well and enjoyable.  Finished the meal with a simple trio of sorbet--raspberry, coconut and mango--accompanied with a mix of blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.  All the courses were all very well prepared and enjoyable, service was good.  Had an opportunity to meet with Matt--sous-chef--and with Frank Micalizzi--manager--both very pleasant and provided wonderful service.

Here are some things we ordered that I can remember:

Mushroom stone bowl - delicious and mushroomy! One of our favorite dishes 
Stone grilled beef -  very neat, cook your own beef on a hot rock. Meat was tender and delicately seasoned 
Oyster & uni shooter - I didn't have a good experience, the uni was pungent and did not taste fresh 
Best chicken wings? I think not. Pretty plain and disappointing, even worse the chicken wings were under cooked and really bloody. 
Black cod - delish

I do love the frozen grapes they give at the end of the meal. But grapes are cheap... Why not more than one! I hassled my server for extra lol.  

Overall the food was good but I'm not dying to go back. The bill adds up quite a lot quickly. I'd rather go to Guu. Food wise I would give Kingyo 3.5 but there is no such thing, and I'll also give them points as I received very good service on my visit.",2013-10-24 00:40:03

We (party of four) walked right in on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately. Only two customers were seated in the restaurant when we came in, and they received their food around the time we placed our orders. 

Ordering was difficult because they were out of many things, including goat, ox tail, ginger beer, and a few more things I didn't quite catch (appetizers, etc.)

We finished our order, and after we had waited for twenty minutes, the waitress finally brought out one person's garden salad. Ten minutes later, after the salad was long finished,  she brought out the appetizer we had ordered.

By this point, the couple who had been eating their meal had already left- we were the only people waiting for food.

Another fifteen minutes later, the waitress came to tell us the food would be right out, but then there was ANOTHER ten minute wait before it actually did come out.

Just shy of an hour after we had put in our order, the food reached the table. It was pretty good, but not worth waiting an hour for, especially when we were the only people waiting for food. 

I might come back here again to give it a second chance, but my first impression was really lousy. Moderately good food (maybe 3.5 out of 5) matched with inexcusably long wait times. It took them just under an hour to cook four meals with a practically empty house. (Though I guess it's possible that they might have been making takeout meals,  preparing ingredients for the next day, or some other thing that would occupy the kitchen.)",2010-12-19 23:45:17

I have never had any issues with Barnes and Noble store before and have always been satisfied with their service. My view has changed after being treated so rudely by one of their workers when I was in the building close to closing. I understand that the building is set to close at 10 pm and I was fully aware of the time but I found it unnecessary to badger me and hover in the area waiting for me to leave. I was using my computer and typing furiously to get my important document sent before closing and a woman kept interrupting me to tell me they were closing and if ""I knew what time it was."" When she proceeded to stay in the area and stare at us, that was the last straw and I left promptly at 9:55 pm. 

I myself work at a bookstore and I would NEVER treat anyone as rudely as this person treated me. I felt rushed, uncomfortable, and unwanted after that experience. I don't plan to go back anytime near closing because I don't want this to happen again and I'm not a confrontational person. But if you are a place of business and your sign says clearly open until 10 pm, please don't badger your customers to leave prior to that.

I think one of things I like compared to those mentioned, is the garlic oil fries.  Some people don't like the thinner fries, but I love them and especially with the garlic flavor.  The burgers are pretty big, and can be ordered as a single or double.  They have a good number of extras you can get on the burgers.  There are plenty of pre-configured burger selections, as well as an option to build your own.  Many of the standard toppings are free no matter how many of them you want, while the more elite toppings will cost you such as bacon, avacado etc.  I think the one negative is that the price is a little bit high.  For the single with garlic oil fries and a drink was just shy of $9.00.  I personally don't think that is super expensive, but I know I can get burgers from other places that are just as good for a few bucks cheaper.

I do not ordinarily buy anything from Mexico but it stated it was organic and I needed it so, on this rare occasion, I bought it. I don't usually shop at Basha's because the people are nasty.

I was surprised to see that this boba shop was pretty packed because the location is somewhat remote (approximately 10 miles away from the Strip). The menu is pretty standard - iced teas, latte teas (aka sea salt creme), milk teas, slushes, fresh brew teas, herbal teas, and sweet crepes. You can also request for a rewards card (buy 10 get 1 free).

***

Jasmine Latte (regular, $3.75 + $0.50 for Honey Boba): OMG this was like freaking top notch SGV quality drink. In fact, this sea salt drink put other SGV boba places (Nest Tea House, etc) that serve similar drinks to shame. Simply a refreshing drink (not overly sweet) and pearls had right sweetness and chewiness. I am not joking around - it was hands down one of the best sea salt drinks I've ever tried. I guess the only problem was too much foam, so it was really hard to suck all the remains pearls.

Taro Slush (regular, $3.95): Before I left Vegas, I actually came back to Brew Tea Bar for a second round. When you order this drink, cashier will ask whether to leave real taro on top of your drink and you almost have to say yes (unless you don't like real taro). I never had a taro drink like this ... powdered taro slush combined with a small chunk of real mashed taro. It was the best of two worlds - you can taste both powdered taro (aka fake taro) and real taro all at the same time! Personally it was the best powdered taro slush ever, period.

Dude I think i will start to make a detour to Brew Tea Bar whenever I am in Vegas.

My friend has the chicken caesar salad which as he described was ""anemic"" in that there was a small sprinkling of chicken for $12. I was drawn in by the 99 cent tacos. You can choose flour or corn. The sign said barbacoa, chicken or bean & cheese. I got two barbacoa and two chicken. It was not barbacoa but it was ground beef. Seasoned ground beef. This is not their barbocoa as another friend got a barbocoa burrito which did not contain ground beef. Strike three was that there was price differences between what is listed on the electronic menu and the written menu. My friend ordered sweet potato tots listed on the electronic menu $4, they attempted to charge her $5. She pointed out the issue and they said that it was listed as $5 on the paper menu. Ultimately they gave her the $1, but just be careful about this. There was at least one other item that had a difference between the price listed on the electronic menu v. paper. 

The positives were fresh brewed ice tea ($1.99), habanero salsa was good and no extra charge for getting it (which there should never be  but  alot of places seem to charge for sides of dressing etc.).",2014-09-04 22:25:17

Having spent the last 16 years near Lake Elsinore, home to the single A Storm where they really know how to make baseball fun for the fans. Thus, I had high expectations for AAA 51s.  The disappointment kicked in when I saw the ugliest mascot in baseball.  I hope Aliens don't look like Donkeys.  Not only that, the mascot hardly circulates the crowd and barely does anything exciting in between innings.  The pizza mascots are more fun. The food is mediocre even for baseball stadiums and the prices are not very good.  The heat makes it unbearable in the summer and although we have good fortune to have great seats inside from a great friend, there is something wierd about watching a game behind the glass where you can't hear the field sounds.  Still it is baseball and I love baseball.  The 51's are decent this year and have some good prospects and familiar faces.

And it's well deserved, let me tell you.

It all starts with the service. We called at about 6:30PM on a Friday night to see if they could squeeze us in. No complaints from them--in fact, they said to come on over and they'd have a table cleared for us within 30 minutes. (Please remember this was a Friday evening! One of the busiest times, ever.) Fast forward and we're walking into an extremely busy, packed-to-the-gills restaurant with a special table reserved just for us. Wow. I can't believe they magically made that happen. 

Then fast forward again to the table service. Misty (spelling?) I think is one of the owners, but regardless, she is Ahhhh-mazing. High energy (always!), fun, quick, efficient and friendly. That's not even touching on the fact that she'll bend over backwards to make you happy. Sheesh, I just love her! 

The food was even more remarkable than I remember. I just had to order the pimento dip with BBQ chips again and it was as delicious as ever. I despise sweet BBQ, so these chips are the perfect seasoning balance for me. If you like sweeter, you might not like them quite as much as I do. Also, the biscuits seemed bigger and better! The butter was creamy, fresh and the jam (I think it was peach?)--well, let's just say I don't like sweet anything, but I was slathering this sweetness on my biscuits like there was no tomorrow. We also started with the oysters Rockefeller and this coming from a girl who hates oysters, clams and mussels: these are what happy dreams are made of. No fishy, brine-y, chewiness, just good ol' deliciousness. 

Now onto the entrees. I don't think anyone of us left hungry. The trout dish was superb!  I was afraid to order it because I don't like oily fish (like salmon), so my boyfriend ordered it. I tasted it and I'm getting it next time around. It was flaky, moist, with a delicious crust and stuffed with crab goodness. The ribeye (which I ordered) was heaven on a plate, served with crunchy potatoes, a spicy sauce and a fried egg on top. I was going to take some home to enjoy later, but then my boyfriend got ahold of it and well, that's that. My sister tried the fried chicken, the variation without the waffle, and her meal was also gone quickly. I also tried the mac'n cheese again, and no dryness this time! Ohmygod, it was so creamy and perfect. It was my friend's side dish, but I ate most of it... whoops. Lastly, we enjoyed (and I mean thoroughly enjoyed) the beignets. I suggest you order those immediately. 

Again, people don't give local businesses enough time to work out their ""newbie bugs"" and the rest of us who don't judge them right off the bat reap the benefits. SOHO is now one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. You can take your high, snooty price point and over the top fancy crap and shove it. I'll take a down-to-earth, fantastic meal without all the expensive hoopla because hell, it sure does taste like I spent just as much as you probably did.

People were complaining about when they would get their apps. 

Anyways, about my food. I order the chicken parm with baked zucchini and red potatoes. The potatoes were bland, the zucchini was not baked but instead marinated in bits of tomatoes and lots and lots of canola oil. Insanely oily. My chicken parm did not look like even a whole piece of chicken, more like a thin slab not even 1/8 of an inch thick, very thin.

However, we went in thinking we were still going to Sweet Tomato only to be bombarded by a youngling waitress working their and wanted to show us a tour of their new place.  We left after the tour and here's why:

1. If you're going to have a different restaurant, stop calling it Sweet Tomatoes

2. WAAAAAY too cluttered.  I couldn't follow what the heck the waitress was saying.  She didn't even mention the part about using some kind of card that remembers everything you ordered and that's how your price total is tallied up.  Nor did she tell me that essentially, you pay everything a la carte - she kind of just tap danced around that part.  I had to research online to finally figure that out.

3. TOOOOO CONFUSING.  You go in there and you don't know where things start or end.  There's just too much going on and in the center there is a huge wine bar (I think that's what it was anyway) and I was just put off by that.  I guess it's not as family friendly as it used to be?

It was just too much to soak in.  I don't have time to go through a tutorial on a restaurant layout when I have a hungry 2 year old.  I was still confused by how the whole place works.  I had to look everything up online.

We may be back and try it sometime but if you don't feel like ""learning something new"" before eating your meal, I'd say skip it for the day.  Sorry Sweet Tomato but this is very disappointing and we are not ones to shy away from new things!

And yes, as other people mentioned, it does feel like you are getting ""nickel and dimed"" - another reason we chose to skip it.  Don't keep the Sweet Tomatoes name if you're not going to keep the same concept!",2013-02-10 04:51:17

You walk in, and the place is spacious and welcoming. All the customers have happy looks on their faces and it's clear why: they are eating THE best burritos in Calgary. Wouldn't YOU be a happy camper?

Once we entered, we were greeted by a really nice staff member who asked us if we were dining in or just ordering. The layout of the place is a little different, you would assume that you would be ordering up front and then having optional seats for you to sit in the front, so the layout of the place IS a little different, but the staff member made it pretty clear to us.

I've never had service as good as this place, but then again, we were the only ones in the store on a Sunday for lunch, other people who came in either got a foodora order or wanted take out. 

Their sushi burrito's range from $8-$12 for half and $14-$18 for a full size - which is normal priced, I'd say for a sushi burrito in Toronto. Coming from uptown, these are actually quite expensive prices in my opinion.

We decided to order a small platter $28.95. It had 28 pcs total, 24 pcs of maki and 4 pcs of nigiri. We got the chef's recommendation which included Crunch, 8 pcs Dynamite, 8 pcs California, 4 pcs Assorted Nigiri. The staff asked if she could get us anything to drink, like an appetizer or a drink, and we were pretty silly to think that these were included cause it was a dine in, and the prices were actually decently expensive, so we got two teas, thinking they were complementary. But, they were actually an additional $1.75 on top. The plating of the portions came in reusable containers, so it wasn't anything too special, and the staff apologized for the ""weirdness"" of the containers.

Weird plates, extra charges, okay. My fault, I didn't read properly. But I have to say, the sushi that came in really wasn't that great. It was a very Westernized style of sushi. The rice was a little soggy in my opinion, the tempura was soft and soggy, no crunch, the rolls were decently sized, but it wasn't anything more than something you can get at t&t or foodymart supermarkets uptown for $10 on sale price. For $40, this was completely not worth it in my opinion, of course other people may say otherwise and I would actually rate this a 1 star restaurant at first, but the staff really made it a little better.

From her great service, I decided to tip her as well, but I really hope this place would consider just having the seats there with no dine in option if their containers and everything used are sort of take-out styled.",2018-01-31 17:41:21

never donated before? here's how it goes down..

you should plan to be there for a minumum of 45 minutes. you'd be surprised how many ppl think you just show up, bleed,and grub in ten minutes. 

first you go through a medical screening. which is like an interview. gotta make sure you're healthy and eligible to donate. you answer a bunch of questions and get your iron and blood pressure checked. remember.. honesty is the BEST policy

if you are eligible you go to the phlebotomy area. your paperwork is reviewed and your kit/bag is set up. if you're doing whole blood avg time is 7-10 minutes once the needle is in. plasma is 25 minutes. double is 30-35 minutes. 

whole blood donation- they take everything. the blood goes straight from your arm to the bag. and thats it!

plasma donation- they take only plasma and red blood cells and return saline solution to you. its like salt water.. gotta rehydrate!

double donation- they take ONLY red blood cells and give you back your own plasma and saline solution. men have to be at least 5'1"" and 130 lbs. women have to be at least 5'5'' and 150 lbs.

NOW you get to grub on cookies... yum.....

I know that I'm a green person so their Green Juice is good too if you're into juices.  Check in on Yelp and get a free chocolate chip cookie which will hit the sweet tooth spot. 

Other things I've tried are the Chicken ""in a Waffle"" - it's ""almost"" like any other chicken n' waffle dish, but here's the kicker, and I've never seen it come with this before, but this comes with a gravy sauce.  Thumbs up on the sauce. I've tried the Hen House wrap but I changed the Cesar dressing to the pecan Honey mustard sauce because I liked the sauce on the Bob sandwich so much.  But I think I should have kept the original sauce on there. It would have probably complemented the wrap better.  And the New England Clam Chowder was just okay for me.

One of the 2 places was Wooche, a Korean BBQ buffet. For me, the highlight of the evening was the adorable turtle living in the lobby that popped his head up to say goodbye. The interior feels like a cafeteria, and overall, the combination of lighting and offerings gave the general impression of not being the freshest. 

The miso soup was okay. I had a large plate of their banchan offerings, and I didn't find one that I wanted to eat endlessly. Each offering was like a bizarro offering: kimchi that had a sweetness, bean sprouts that were too salty, radish that was too sour. Given that the main attraction to Korean for me is the banchan, this was a big disappointment. From the fast food bar, I sampled the lomein, and it too had an odd flavor, heavy on the white pepper. 

As for the meat, I nibbled on this and that. The larger hunks of meat were unimpressive, like a side of meat you may have been served in elementary school. The definite standouts were the pork selections, spicy chicken and the bulgogi. Actually, the bulgogi dipped in the jalapeno soy sauce was delicious, and the culinary highlight of my experience. 

I think there are better options in Vegas, perhaps a bit more expensive, but when it comes to meat, I am willing to pay for quality over quantity. Meat coma is not a good thing. I was leaning towards 2 stars, but the service is nice, value is pretty good, and I admit I have an innate bias against buffets of any variety, except Indian.",2010-08-03 22:56:34

We really liked their food on the day we visited. I've read through some of the other less glowing reviews and wonder if it's just that their consistency might be an issue. On this visit, we had some amazing plates - I thoroughly enjoyed their breakfast quesadilla, and my wife enjoyed one of their specialty omelets. The food was served promptly and at the right temperature, usually one of my biggest gripes with eating breakfast in many restaurants. Our waitress was very friendly, and didn't miss a beat with our table's fairly complex ordering. The ambience was great - not too noisy, but upbeat enough to be interesting.

So let's start with appetizers we had the crab cakes which here they were your typical crab cakes nothing special but still tasted petty good.

Bone marrow!! I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!

So the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience

Our cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.

As for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious

The salon is one of the first floor businesses of a new condo. The parking for the salon is the visitor parking for the building which is located behind the studio. There is an entrance to the salon from the parking and you can run in and grab a parking pass which you'll need to display on your dash.

When you walk in you can tell that the salon is brand new. A lot of times I've walked into a nail salon and the chairs were ragged, floors dirty, etc. That doesn't make me feel good about the tools they're going to use on me. This place however, was spotless! 

I made an appointment for a mani/pedi and they were able to tend to me right away. They have a lot of colour selection so it's good to get there a few minutes early and look through them all. My manicure technician recommended some colours which was helpful for me since I tend to rely on the same colours. I was seated at one of the pedicure stations in a very comfy chair and two technicians started on my mani and pedi. They were both very quick with their hands and efficient. They were also very quiet. There was zero talking which I kinda prefer so I can enjoy the experience. There was a nice arm and leg massage that was part of the procedure as well. The drying station was comfortable and they didn't rush me out. My entire service was $38 which was awesome for a great service and my nails turned out really well!

During my appointment which was on a Thursday afternoon, there were a few walk-ins. Not all of them could be accommodated ASAP so I would recommend making an appointment. If there is a bit of a wait, there is a plaza next door with a Panera Breads and Five Guys where you can pass the time.

I had an amazing wild blossom something (but I switched out the gin for vodka)..it had vodka, elderflower liqueur, grapefruit juice, and cranberry juice. I actually had to write the recipe, so I can try it at home. 
As for the food, we started with the east and west coast oysters. I don't really like them, but my girlfriend does, so I try. She said that they were really good, I just took a huge sip of my cocktail after, so it wasn't so bad. They then brought out very tasty popovers, which I could eat for days, but luckily we only had one each. They then brought out a pate with some bread, which was really good (I don't love pate, but this was great). 
I ordered the New York strip (excellent). She ordered the lamb (loved it) and we ordered creamed spinach and onion rings as sides.

Piola (stands for ""meeting place"") is an extremely exciting pizzeria with an entertaining story. Born in 1986 in Italy, it has since transformed into an international sensation boasting establishments all over the Americas and two in Europe, the original in Treviso and a second in Istanbul.

As simple as the food may be the flavours are exceptional, it's easy to tell they use only the finest ingredients and the recipes are tried and tested. 

I had the Diavola pizze (mozzarella & spicy salami) and it was stunning. Blistered crusts, super thin, stringy cheesy, delicious tomato sauce, a generous amount of salami and perfectly cooked. I also added spicy Italian sausage to this for $2.00 which was well worth it. I also doused the pizze in their in house made chili oil which was a great compliment. 

The other pizze I tried featured goat cheese, grilled eggplant, yellow zucchini and cherry tomatoes. Again, exact same description as above, a beautiful thing indeed. 

Service was exceptional, I interacted with 4 members of the staff and all were eager to answer any questions and they were all very attentive and knowledgeable. A manager also stopped by our table halfway through our meal to ask how our experience was coming along. It's no surprise to me that representatives from the headquarters in Italy trekked down to this location to design the menu and train the staff, it definitely shows. Decor was very unique, extremely colourful and stimulating. 

The menu boasts an impressive appetizer list, nearly 2 dozen pizzes, a neat pasta list and several desserts.  Mill Street Organic can be found on tap as well as several other international beers in the bottle including Peroni my favourite pizza pairing beer, a wine list is also readily available. 

Overall I had a phenomenal dinner experience at an affordable price tag. I predict that the nearby Pizzeria Libretto will now have a reduced wait time for their standard lines with this beast in the neighborhood, the Terroni's and Mercatto's may also experience a similar change. 

In closing, I would also like to mention that I made reservations for this coming Thursday because on the 29th of every month Piola hosts ""lucky gnocchi"". On this day guests can enjoy all you can eat gnocchi in up to 7 different flavours for only $14.99! I will update my review then.

5 stars for Ambience: I really loved the ambience here. I don't know how they did it but I felt extremely comfortable and ready to eat as soon as I entered the door. I would definitely hire their interior designer if I ever opened a sushi joint. Furthermore, I like how everyone is in costume from the sushi chefs to the kimonos on the waitresses. 

3 stars for Nigiri: Ordered yellowtail, salmon, and uni. It wasn't fresh as I expected. Is it because it was a Monday night?

2 stars for Dinner Bento box: It came with tofu steak, katsu, and other bento items. Weak dish, pobably not a good idea to order it again.

3 stars for Kake Udon: Noodles were perfectly cooked, broth had a nice mushroom/earthy undertone.

3.5 stars for agedashi tofu: Decent flavors and decent serving (enough for 3-4 people to share).

On any given day falafels and gyros can keep calling, calling, calling me to lunch or dinner.   Been wanting to try out Great Greek for a while, but it's a little more east than I usually travel.   Tonight I found myself in the area and decided to call in some takeout.  I went with a lamb gyro with feta fries on the side, and asked for a side of falafel because I simply have to try some at every Greek restaurant I go to because it's in the title of my list here on Yelp for Mediterranean eats.  When I arrived the food was ready and waiting for me and I was happy to see Dr. Pepper on the list of fountain drink options because as you may know, Dr. Pepper is the unofficial non-alcoholic nectar of the Gods.  

I did have to drive about 20 minutes until I got home, so please take that into consideration for the food review that follows.  I immediately went for some feta fries which were pretty standard french fries covered in, you guessed it, feta cheese.  Because of the drive, the feta cheese had sort of started to congeal a little, but it had no effect on the taste and I found them delicious.   I will say for a quick comparison that I do prefer Yanni's Gyros fries where he adds garlic, feta and hot sauce, but I digress.  Then came the gyro.  With the first bite I knew it was something special.  Tender, flavorful gyro meat with the standard lettuce tomato and onion SMOTHERED in tzatziki and feta.   I think it had more of these two ingredients than any gyro I've had elsewhere, and to me that was a good thing.  Between the fries and the gyro the meal was fetariffic!  Sorry about that.  Lastly I tried some of the side of falafel, and was a little disappointed in those.  They weren't bad by any means, but I feel like I've had better in many places like Hedary's and the Fat Greek for example.  The texture was good, but it just wasn't as flavorful as I like.

Prices were reasonable and service was friendly and efficient.  If Great Greek were closer to my work or home I'd make it a regular visit, but for now it will remain a solid choice when I'm in the area (which is almost never.  Step your game up Sunset Station!)",2012-10-03 04:48:25

I was pleasantly surprised to hear about a soup fest close to where I live. I was also quite excited to taste soups created with local meat and produce from over 30 vendors!

I arrived around 12:30 at the soup festival and it was crazy crowded. There were long lineups for a lot of the vendors. It was kind of disappointing that around 1 pm quite a few soup makers started to run out. The festival turned out to be a lot more popular than I had expected.

It was an amazing experience nonetheless. I had some spectacularly creative and equally delicious soups and got to meet many great cooks. The tickets for this event are very reasonably priced as well and you will definitely get your money's worth. I was full after tasting 7-8 vendors and they also had free bread to go with the soups. The sampling cups were the size of the small espresso cups.

The only issue was the crowded tent where they had set up all the soup stalls. Although the tent was a good cover from the rain, it was very cozy in there. I would have liked them to be a bit more spread out so that all the attendees would have some more space to stand and enjoy their samples. I guess they didn't expect so many people. 

As an added bonus they also had a live band playing some great tunes. They also gave everybody swag bags which had Soupfest mugs. Although they did run out of those by 1:30 pm.

I came here recently with my beau for a special birthday dinner, seeing as they had several vegetarian options on their menu. We booked our reservation on OpenTable, which I was glad to see that they actually used. I noted that both of us diners were vegetarian and found that our server and hostess were very accommodating in that respect.

We were seated outside, which offered us a pleasant experience on their lovely patio. Their ambiance is nice and their service outstanding. I found that everyone there knew what they were talking about and possessed a deep passion for food, as opposed to obnoxious pretense which upscale restaurants like Casbah can have.

As for the food, it was above average. Nothing outstanding, but definitely still tasty. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi (made veg), which turned out to be excellent, while I got the cavatelli (also made veg). We also shared a half-order of the torchetti and unfortunately, neither the cavatelli nor the torchetti stood out too much.

On top of the delicious food our server Jeff was fantastic. He could not have been any more friendly or attentive. If you decide to stop in ask for him and I am sure you will be delighted.

I had actually been craving the roasted chicken and brussel sprouts from my last visit (and I normally NEVER order chicken, but their preparation is so flavorful and moist), so imagine my disappointment when they were both absent from the menu.  However, this disappointment didn't last long when my perfectly prepared Fire Roasted Veal Chop was placed in front of me.  My husband and friend both ordered the 22 oz. rib-eye. If you order this, come hungry! We shared a couple delicious appetizers and sides, but even the bread alone is so delicious.  

My 2 year old daughter (who also has quite the palate) was with us and we were able to order from an off-menu children's dinner for $18.  We ordered the roasted chicken and mashed potatoes for her, and she enjoyed every bite.  It was such a refreshing change to have a beautifully presented child's meal, instead of the typical chicken fingers and french fries.

The cocktail menu was pretty interesting. So many cocktails sounded delicious but at the same time not. I was indecisive and eventually ordered the RPG Martini (rhubarb pear ginger). Interesting concept but I had to trade with my dinner partner because it tasted pretty awful. The grapefruit take on the negroni was pretty interesting as well but you couldn't taste the grapefruit, it just looked cloudy. The negroni is currently my favourite cocktail but unfortunately O&B offers a cloudy, watered-down version of it.

The side salad was very mediocre and I would never have expected such a sad salad at a place that is supposed to be owned by some of the most renowned chefs of Toronto. It was basically salad greens tossed in a basic vinaigrette. Nice try with the fennel and radishes but it was super boring. It tasted pretty decent but for a restaurant salad I was expecting more than that.

Once again, overcooked meat at an O&B restaurant. I ordered the rack of lamb and asked for medium rare and it came out medium well. Same thing happened at Luma, another O&B resto, so I wasn't surprised this time around. The beans that came with it were bland, boring, and somewhat overcooked. After I got them out of the way I was able to somewhat enjoy the rest. The sage crustiness around the lamb mixed with the homemade gnocchi really saved the dish. That was some of the best gnocchi I've ever had, and the creaminess with the sage crustiness was really good. This was the saving grace of the dish. The lamb left much to be desired, and was a pretty small portion. They should focus more on the gnocchi in the future, it really is a highlight there. They should also not overcook their meat.

Unfortunately, the service is fake-friendly and amongst the slowest I've encountered ever at any restaurant of this calibre. Not very helpful when asking for recommendations or additional info, but honest when it came to the after-dinner menu, saying that everyone sends back the Aztec hot chocolate. Good sign? Service was just so impeccably slow and inattentive--everything from ordering, to the empty water glasses throughout the table that we needed to keep asking for refills, to settling up. She was quick to drop the bill on the table after I ordered the worst cappuccino I've ever had at a restaurant, but we had to get up to find someone to pay with so we can leave and that took forever.

Overall, the food was pretty mediocre, the ambiance was great on the patio with the cushy seats and heat lamps. This is an excellent space to work with, unfortunately the dinner crew needs to step it up a notch. I don't find myself returning here again. It depends what you're looking for. Drinks on a nice heated outdoor patio with mediocre and overpriced food is what can be expected here. It's an amazing space and I want to love it and come back but I just can't get over the horribly slow service.

Happy hour specials are $4.50 beer, $6 wine, $7 cocktails.  $3-$8 food specials.

Came in for afternoon happy hour.  Got off to a bit of a rocky start.  They asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or a table.  We said first available then waited over 20 min for them to sit us at the bar that was vacant the whole time.  Once inside we could see there were several open tables as well.  I understand restaurants need to stagger tables.  20 min seemed a bit much.  Maybe I just needed a drink.  Lol.  You can make reservations for happy hour so I will definitely do that next time.  

We started with a Melona Breeze and Coronarita.  Second round was Caribbean Cosmo and Carpe Diem.  Drinks were yummy.  For food we chose Chicken teriyaki pizza, 777, crunch and spider rolls.  Everything but the spider roll came out quick.  Sushi tasted great.  I don't usually think of pizza when going to sushi but the chicken teriyaki pizza was really good too.  We thought they forgot the spider roll.  We were pretty full so didn't mind as long as we weren't charged.  If ended up coming out after we were done with our other food.

Here's my favorite favorite part about Sakana. AND I'm sure it's other nigiri lovers' favorite also. THE FISH TO RICE RATIO = BEAUTIFUL. Gorgeous amount of fresh fish on top of a small bed of rice. THATS the best.

They have tons on kitchen ware items, random geekery and mirrors but their selection in clocks is probably the most impressive.

I scratched my head last spring after seeing a couple of reviews and checkins and wondered why I hadn't seen it sooner. When I went in search of it, I understood why. It's a bit out of the way in the same building as tourism Calgary and if you don't know to be on the lookout for it, it's likely you'll miss it. But it's there! Open for breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, lunch, and afternoon tea. Don't get any ideas about filling up for your 6pm dinner or 9pm supper though... These doors close at 330pm weekdays.

Now that the weather is turning a bit more nipply, (no, not a typo ;) )' may I suggest you start with a bowl of Matzoe ball soup - light broth, with a dumpling made from bread turned into crackers then rolled all up together. Hope you're bringing your appetite because if you follow up with a sandwich, you might be carrying half your meal out the door to save for your next hobbit meal. If that's the case, you should get the Grumans Grilled Special. It's my favourite, though the Reuben is sure to please and these folks might know a thing or two about making a Montreal smoked meat sammy.

If you want a new breakfast place to try, Grumans does that too! And don't worry about waking up early... It goes all day on Saturdays and Sundays. On my list to try is the Challah French Toast and Lox Benedict.

Oh, did I mention Grumans also does catering? Yep... You can spread the love for The drool-worthy goodness coming from this delicatessen at your next meeting or event.

Several beers on tap...I imagine that is the reason for the crowd because it certainly isn't the food.  The food is greasy Pittsburgh fare that doesn't seem really all that great.  Granted, I loved the fries.  But would I wait for 30 minutes for a table for really unhealthy, generally unimpressive food?  Nope.  

Fortunately we had just beaten the crowds or I would not be writing this review.   After we were seated, people poured in.

But Café Névé did something right to catch my sister's attention.  She's a brisk, focussed walk-er.  Only she knows how or why she spotted it.

Névé is cute, unpretentious and communal.  The only cringe factor came from the hipsters behind the counter.  A little too much-ster.  

The coffee was good.  And while I prefer a cappuccino in the afternoon it was a little too pricey for me.  For me, the focus shouldn't be on the coffee anyway.  Névé serves happiness on a sheet pan - cookies and other baked goods.  A simple pan on the counter, next to the register.  

I looked at the pan and the chocolate chip cookie whispered, 'eat me', which probably means I'm stressed out about something.  I don't ever crave sugar or hear voices unless I have a lot going on.

So I get the cookie.  Two hours later while waiting for dinner reservations, I took a bite of the cookie and I swear I nearly lost my mind.  It was one of the BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever had.  EVER.  My enthusiasm for this cookie is off-the-charts.

It was sweet (but not painfully).  It had the nicest burnt caramel like crust on the edges and a soft, chewy (but totally cooked) centre.

Fortunately, I had been doing Yoga for a while before this and so I already was familiar with a lot of the moves so I was able to keep up with the pace.  

I was thinking of getting a friend to sign up with me for one of their Groupon deals, but I was glad I did not as she would have likely quit after the first class.  As others have mentioned the instructors give very little instructions and just expects the class to know the routine as if it were an intermediate level class.  

As for the studio itself, it is indeed cramped with 30+ people for each class.  This studio attracts a lot of young professionals, which I found great as my other yoga experiences were with a room full of gray haired people and old men with a a lot of body hair.  So seeing younger healthy bodies sharing the floor was a plus! 

For the men, the change room is quite spacious considering the ratio of men:women.  It has multiple showers and double sinks and enough room to not have accidentally rub butts against each other.  

So overall, I would say it`s a decent studio.  They have a variety of classes and lots of good after work time slots every day of the week.  It's good for those who already know some yoga, but not for newbies that are sucked in by Groupon type deals.",2013-09-27 14:08:39

What's included (salad, soup, tuna tataki, a roll of egg, shrimp tempura, fried chicken, pork belly and fried taro ball).    While it sounds like a lot and looks like a lot (when you receive the tray), it's actually a reasonable amount.

-Miso soup had plenty of veggies and seaweed on it.
-Fried chicken had a great mixture of fat and meat to it.  
-Shrimp tempura was crunchy.  
-The presentation
-Their bathrooms! They took so much pride with the Halloween decorations, it was epic.

I was expecting an out-of-this-world fish sandwich but I didn't think it was all that. I love that it's a cute little mom-and-pop place, and that their service is really ...gentle. I used to think this little cubby-hole of a resto seemed out of place in Little Italy but the area has been changing a lot over the last couple of years. The night we stopped in was a chilly one and while I feared walking out smelling like grease--surprisingly, we didn't. 

When we arrived, we were ecstatic that we didn't have to wait too long because the place is pretty tiny and that would have meant standing in the cold. The trio of staff all got up from their table in the corner to get working on our order. We were just two, looking for a quick and cheap bite. We got the tilapia and grouper, both served up on a Portuguese bun, which, if you've never had one it's a bit chewy on the outside but fluffy and airy on the inside--perfect for a fish sandwich. I really wanted the black cod (the selection varies slightly from day to day) but was in the mood for a sandwich and didn't want to ruin the joy of such a great fish with a bun and other dressings. Both sandwiches contained juicy grilled fliets of fish, and came with lettuce and tomato. They would have been perfect with some kind of mayo concoction or aioli but instead there was something else along with lime salt which wasn't bad but a sauce would've been better and given it a heartier taste, I think. We grabbed a couple of cans of pop (they sell San Pellegrino sodas for pretty cheap) and wolfed down our sandwiches. I don't recall how much we paid but it was in the $20 range.  

As we were being served, suddenly people began to pour in. From the sounds of things, they didn't seem like first-timers so it looks like The Fish House has a following.
I like that there were many fish to choose from and different options: served on rice, with greens, or on a bun. Next time I'll try a better fish with rice. When we got up to leave, one of the staff urged us to take a piece of gum. He was so endearing~",2013-02-18 20:12:29

The place is very well decorated with minimalist asian influences, the service is friendly, the portions were large and very well priced, BUT the food was up and down.  

I came here for lunch with my sister after a rough day of xmas shopping.  We got in around 3 and were given the brunch menu.  Apparently they serve lunch and brunch until 4pm (recession much?).  My sister got the brunch special of appetizer (enoki tom yum soup- this was very flavorful, almost a little to sweet tasting), entree (house pad thai- yes I agree it was strangely red and not authentic tasting), and coconut crepes (for someone who doesn't like desserts, I thought these were yummy and large enough to share).   I got the beef curry pad thai, recommended by the server, it was decently yummy.  We also got house spring rolls to share.  The portions were huge and we had almost an entire meal left over.  Total price not including tax and tip= $25. Not too shabby.

The food is mediocre, but I would come back for the decor, service, and warmth (it's FREEEZING in Toronto!)",2009-12-21 15:29:46

The service was friendly, fast and knowledgeable of the menu items. We ordered Thai ice tea, pad Thai and a sticky rice with mango for desert.

The presentation was definitely nice especially the way the pad Thai was packaged (see my Instagram post). Although the pad Thai wasn't spicy even though the server told me it is. Regardless it has a nice balance of sweet, sour, and seasoning.

The Thai ice tea was superb. Strong taste from the tea and the sweetness from the condense milk. As for the sticky rice with mango, the rice was consistent in soft texture with the right amount of coconut. The mango could be better if it was more ripen.

Overall for the price, a little high for me even as a fast food. But food and service quality met expectations.",2018-05-07 21:22:31

You cannot beat its location.  It's the middle of Strip District, and everyone comes to Strip District on the weekend.

I always pass by here but I have no idea how this hike is. We got there past 8am and started to navigate the trail while stopping in each and every beautiful flowers we saw to take pictures. We end up climbing a big rock on the left side to take pictures and while doing it we heard a rattle sound! I got scared! For the longest time I hike in redrock, that was the very first time I heard a rattle snake! Like everywhere else when you're  in a National Park you need to be careful and be mindful at all times. We left that site immediately and proceeded to the turtlehead peak. It was a slow ascent during the first 20 minutes. We were enjoying the cold breeze and the warmth of the sun. We stopped in the first midsize rock on the middle of the path. We can see the turtlehead peak on the right, the sky was blue and the chemical rays are quite fabulous! 

In the meantime we didn't really know the end part of the hike as we have no map. We are basically just following the people hiking before us. After a few minutes, oh boy the trail was getting harder and harder. It became a vertical hike. The trail is quite rocky and loose. Some part are full of gravel. It's quite dangerous. We tried to look for another way where more stable rocks to climb on but we ended up in a steep spots. Stay on the trail, do not look for short cuts as there are none. You will end up in a more dangerous spots. Stop and rest, drink water and don't rush. Always take your time and phase. 

We finally arrived on the top big rock at the last curve heading to the peak. We sat behind that rock to rest and few steps away is a beautiful view of the Canyon. From there is another 20 minutes to the peak depending on your phase. It took us at least a couple of hours to the top. The view is amazing. If you will do this hike, come prepared and never give up. If your halfway, might as well finish it. It's well worth it. 

After the scenic view, the cool breeze and the warmth of the sun, going down is another thing. It is quite grueling and uncomfortable. I got blisters on my feet. Going downhill requires a great balance and control. While it was a steep incline going up, what can you expect going downhill! Make sure your hiking shoes is your best hiking shoes. It took as an hour to go down. It was a fun and challenging hike. If you love to hike and haven't tried this trail, I highly recommend but remember to come prepared, bring enough water and some snacks. Wear sunblock. Rest when you need to. This is not for older people who are frail and not fit. For an experienced hiker this is moderate but for others it is quite a strenuous hike.",2017-04-28 13:53:37

Beer selection is impressive, waitstaff fairly friendly. The clientele is usually drunk and yinzery (albeit endearing).

Also, their space is really narrow and small, which is fine when it's empty, but extremely annoying when it's not.

They mainly have pastas, pizzas and other salads and antipasti. It has a great selection for vegetarians, with lots of salads and pizza choices, but very few for non-pork eaters! Almost everything had pancetta or ham, and their homemade pasta sauce is a pork and beef sauce. It was good that it was noted on the menu though. 

The pastas really didn't seem like anything special. Most I felt like I could make at home. I guess that's the way I feel about most italian places now, but some places really do wow me with ingredients or pasta sauces that would be difficult to perfect at home. It could be that I am much more discerning about italian food these days too. My Ditalini with pancetta, onion and pandano cheese was good, and al dente, but a little bland. Spicing it up with hot chilli peppers (Which we had to ask for) made it excellent. 

The hubby ordered the Salmon, Dill and Brie pizza. Very skimpy on the salmon, and maybe one piece of brie (on top of mozzarella) didn't make much of an impression. 
The crust was thin and limpy - not crispy enough. It doesn't beat Queen Marghuerita or Libretto 
The Wild Boar pizza was generous though, but still tasted extremely cheesy.

Even though the food was always good we never liked the fact that they didn't have a true non smoking section. The restaurant is non smoking but is adjacent to a bar where smoking is allowed and there is no separation between the two. If I can smell it and need to shower when I get home than it is not non smoking in my book. That is not my complaint however, I knew what I was getting into there. My complaint is about the service.

We waited a longer than acceptable time to order. We were all pretty hungry and some of us ordered the pies which we are aware take longer than the average entrée so we ordered a cup of soup in addition. Our server was either absent or darting by so fast we couldn't get her attention between when we ordered and our food came out. Several of our drinks were dry and those of us who ordered soup were wondering if it had been forgotten. In addition a couple of us wanted to order something from the bar but gave up on that idea. The soup did came out with the entrees and when I commented that I had expected it quite awhile ago the server just said that the kitchen put everything out at one time.

Now I am not naïve or self centered enough to think that they made a special pot of soup for me so I am not sure what was so difficult about ladling it into a cup, or more importantly why she didn't check on it when it didn't come up very shortly after the order had been placed. I was not expecting a grand gesture but a simple apology would have sufficed. To add to that our glasses sat empty until my husband stood up and called her back and requested refills.

The food itself was pretty good. The stilton and cabbage soup is excellent and the steak and mushroom pie is very tasty if not a little sparse on filling, especially for the price. The mashed potatoes were the one bleak spot of the dinner, not even warm and hardened as if they had sat out for too long. So overall, pricey for what it is and service seems to be pretty spotty.

Boring. :P But I digress.

The room: Very nice and large. It was almost the size of a suite. The bed was so comfy that I wanted to take it home with me! I also liked how the toilet and bathtub were in a separate room from the sink area.
Location: I don't know about now(I rarely ever venture anywhere south of Tropicana to be honest) but back then it was surrounded by absolutely NOTHING. The bleak, middle-of-nowhere location seriously creeped me out, no lie. I don't know what it is about being somewhere in the middle of nowhere that bugs me so much.
Restaurants: The buffet was mediocre to point of it being overwhelming. It reminded me of The Orleans, but worse. I did like the Cafe though(can't remember the name) and Baja Miguel was just okay. 
Entertainment: The movie theater was decent(I saw Scary Movie 4 here) and I really liked the arcade too. Bowling alley looked nice but I didn't try it out. 
Pool: They hadn't finished construction on it at the time we stayed here.
Miscellaneous: The whole entire place is very.....plain. :/ It's nice, but other than that there's really nothing special about it at all. Rumor has it Flavor Flav comes here a lot, which is pretty damn random if you ask me.

So overall it's a decent hotel for your money if you don't mind being sort of isolated. There was a shuttle to The Strip that came and went every 45 minutes, I'm not sure if they still have it though.",2010-08-12 21:57:56

The interior design is not only beautiful but so efficient too! Somehow a garage became an INSTA-WORTHY environment. The light fixtures and simplistic design  ultimately create the perfect spot for studying, catching up with an old friend, or relaxing on your own.

Unlike most cafes, this place has PLENTY of seating! Not only that, but there are booths in which you can adjust the lighting and have your own personal outlets!

Another bonus? FREE WI-FI! The password is posted where the trash cans, napkins, sugar and cream are.

How is the food?
The menu is perfect! Not too overwhelming nor is it limiting. The Banh Mi sandwiches are made with care and taste super fresh! You can choose among 4 types!

And the drinks?
Honestly the coffee is so good! It definitely tastes fresh and authentic, which means a lot coming from me because I'm super picky with my coffee! I got the Iced Vanilla Latte (as I was craving something sweet). You can ask for skim or whole milk. They even sell Vietnamese Drip Coffee! And they grind their beans to order! I have yet to try the bubble tea, but I have no doubt that it will be of quality as I've seen so many customers order the green tea!

The bathrooms are clean and the service is so friendly! The guy who owns the place so evidently cares for the customers and puts his heart into his work! He talks to customers to see how he can improve the experience for everyone.

I'm MOST DEFINITELY coming back! I low-key (selfishly) want to keep this place to myself, but I already know that I can't stop the buzz! And I wish the workers and the owner the best, though I'm confident they don't need luck with the overall quality of this business.",2017-08-14 22:50:48

To my misfortune, they ran out of soup when I got there (around 3 in the afternoon). Soup is my favorite, but I do like me some paninis! A friend and I ordered the 3-cheese panini and the eggplant panini. Both were very delicious and full of flavor! The bread was the ideal texture. I also distinctly identified the pesto within the sandwich and found it to be very savory! Mmm! They were both such great sandwiches and they both came with a little serving of mixed greens. I have no idea what the dressing was, but that was scrumptious, too, and very light!

On a side note, I think a common complaint people have with ""eating healthy"", fresh, or light meals like these is that they don't ""feel full"" afterward. But this definitely had me stuffed in the best way possible! To go with my panini, I had myself a hot chai and it was perfect right down to a tea (tee)! Lol. Never mind the awkward pun... The modern decor is white and bright! The daylight comes in through the windows so beautifully! The simplicity of the decor also brings attention to the lovely photos on the walls!

Lastly, the service was awesome! Everyone here talks of Olivier so kindly and it is definitely true how personable he is to his customers. As someone who likes to experiment with different diets (pescetarianism, vegetarianism, veganism), when he mentioned vegetarian options, I was definitely over the moon. He noticed that and didn't hesitate to ask about it. Who doesn't like genuine, friendly service?!

I really wanted to try the charity bread but craved calamari so I got that instead for apps - and it was amazing!

The calamari was delicious but was even better with that AMAZING basil garlic aoili sauce. I just wanted to dip everything in that sauce. The other red sauce was okay. Spicy but in comparison with the green sauce, definitely the green sauce! 

My friend got the caprese salad, looks delicious! I will need to try it next time. 

I ordered the Pesto Pollo Fettucini which was absolutely amazing. Only one thing that I did not like was the texture of the chicken. Like there was some pieces that felt like store bought prepacked cooked chicken but the pasta and the sauce was already amazing that I could have done without the chicken. The pasta was cooked perfectly, just enough sauce and flavor, I was one happy girl. 

For desserts, my bestfriend ordered the cheese cake and I ordered the salted chocolate cake. I think it was a mistake because I was soooo stuffed and tried forcing myself to finish the cake. It was alright, nothing wrong with a chocolate cake! 

I will definitely be coming back here for to try other things like their pizza. They definitely hook you with by walking around with samples! So yummmy!

These boots were MUCH cheaper than anywhere else. Now, some were marked as defects, but this was done very clearly. But the non messed up boots were also a steal!  I ended up getting two pairs for less than one pair normally would cost.  See how I rationalize?

The guy in the boot department was so helpful. I have had many boots in my day so I know all about how you have to get them a bit tight because they stretch, and that the heel will slip at first, etc.  But there were some other women shopping who were clueless and the VERY patient sales guy (I think his name was Tony) was really trying to explain everything to them.

The decor and the ambiance are quite unique from the regular Korean eateries.

There was a short wait when we came in. When we were taken to the table, all the side dishes were laid out and ready for us. The menu is quite simple, only beef and pork and side dishes. There is no chicken nor seafood on the menu.  For vegetarians, I guess you can get by as well. 

We ordered the family combination for 4 people. There were four different meats - skirt steak, short ribs, spicy short ribs and pork ribs. the waiter cooked on the table top in front of you. The meats were all of different distinct flavors, very delicious and tasty. Quality was excellent and the quantity was more than enough.

Included in the dinner were various Korean side dishes that can be refilled on request. A steam egg casserole and a bean paste soup also came with the dinner. For deserts, rice cake ice cream sandwich, absolutely delicious was also part of the meal. For $89 for 4 for such quality and quantity is definitely worth a 5 star. 

My two negative comments are: 1. The music was way too loud, making casual conversation a wee bit difficult. 2. The spicy pork was good but also too spicy. 

As with all Korean food, where garlic is used for marinating, there is always a breath issue after consuming a Korean meal. This establishment provides mouth wash, tooth brush and etc for their customers. The first I have ever seen in a Korean restaurant.

My mom and I ordered the seafood hot pot. Okay when you think hot pot, you think of those pots where you throw in a bunch of veggies, seafood, meat, what have you - never did I think that it meant it was SPICY HOT.  We had started off with our unimpressive appeitzer of the catfish/scallop/shrimp dumplings with ""nuoc cham"" which is basically fish sauce.  The four dumplings were about the size of a quarter and sat inside a HUGE bowl filled with fish sauce.  For $8, I'd say that's a hefty rip off.  We all literally leaned in towards the table to look inside the giant bowl at our dumplings.  Next up we ordered the wood grilled octopus/sea weed/xo aioli sauce - BLAH.  All bun, no octopus.  We also tried the peking duck/house bacon/mizuna/charred plum jam - that was just meh.  Ugh so disappointing, at yet another $4/bun.  

My mom's SPICY seafood udon bowl came out - it was too spicy so she gave it to my dad.  And he ate it.  Said it was decent.  We sat there and watched him eat.....eat.....eat....eat....and then he was done.....and we sat there and looked at his empty bowl as our bowls had still yet to come out.  I don't get it, we ordered 2 of the same bowls - at least the 2nd one should have come out?  The hostess came to clear my dads bowl - I told her we still hadn't gotten ours yet, she kinda apologized and walked off.  About 15 minutes later, the 2nd udon bowl came out and one of the pork ramen bowls came out.  So I told my mom and hubs to eat.  As I sat there and watched them eat.....and eat.....and eat.  Towards their last few bites, my pork ramen bowl came out - the server, or maybe it was the manager came out to deliver it to me and apologized for the delay of the entire meal and said this bowl was on the house.  That was a nice gesture - but considering the circumstances, all our bowls should have been comp'd.  My mom and I couldn't finish our pork bowls - it was so extremely salty - the ""broth"" was so dark it tasted and looked like it was sitting in a bowl of soy sauce.

Dog dessert.... The ice cream was definitely for human. Well, it was much sweeter than my Haagen dazs vanilla ice cream. Of course my dog loved it. Hope she doesn't get diabetes.

They were out of Veal and turkey meat balls.
Maybe everything tasted great if I had a bottle of red wine or two like the other couple that was sitting across from us. Too bad I didn't drink this time. Next time, I'll come back with a designated driver :-)",2016-05-18 06:50:26

I've been here several times and have not yet gotten past my menu indecisiveness. At other restaurants, I will narrow it down to 2, maybe 3 things, and then just go on gut instinct when the server arrives. However, at a recent dinner with a friend, we both found ourselves flipping pages back and forth, almost unable to make up our minds. (Indecisiveness loves company, it would seem.)

Though I tried to resist the temptation, I ended up going with my usual, the Mini Burgers. Holy pickle on a stick, that is a good burger. I also got a Spider Roll, and at the last minute, I threw on an order of eel Nigiri, just in case. My server double checked to make sure I was hungry enough for all that food, and indeed, I was. 

All of the food was, as always, spectacular, but I have never seen such slices of eel in all my life. They were like salmon filets, they were so big, and the minuscule seaweed strip couldn't even hold them onto their tiny rice beds. As soon as they arrived I understood my servers skepticism. Still, I found room. 

My friend enjoyed his falafel pita immensely, and we made good on the trio of spreads.  His cupcake (the night's special, Kahlua cake with Bailey's icing and chocolate chips) was divine, though I was a little full to steal as much of it as I could have.

Oh how I wish the space were bigger, but Spring will soon be here and the patio will add more seating.

I have been to Mesa Grill before, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and remember it being phenomenal.  Food Network celebrity chef Bobby Flay owns the place, and that is a pretty damn good endorsement.  It's also in one of my favorite Vegas spots, Caesars Palace.

We started with a delicious Chicken Quesadilla appetizer, but moved into bigger and better items with the main course...

The girls each ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken with garlic-mango sauce and buttermilk-chive mashed potatoes.  Alby ordered the Grilled Pineapple Mahi Mahi with green chile rice.  And I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbled Pork Tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale.

We all shared bites with each other.  I thought the Mahi was best, the girls thought the Pork was best.  Alby liked the chicken.  All three items were actually pretty spicy and hot (warning to you wusses out there).  I will say, my sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was untouchable as far as our side dishes went.

Dessert was the only blemish on a perfect evening of dining.  We had the Peach Berry Cobbler, and while it was good... the awful ginger ice-cream really put a strange and unnecessary twist to it.

They're two very different experiences - you're paying for all the little touches when you go high-end. The Keg is the sort of place you go when you want that ""upscale"" dining experience at a more reasonable price point.

That's not to say that The Keg is bad. Far from it. This location, right in the heart of the Financial District, has style for days and offers quick, attentive service and consistent food.

""Consistency"" is the mark of any good restaurant, and I saw it again when I visited three weeks back. My friends and I were in the city looking to hit up a restaurant after a Jays game and settled on Keg. A long walk and a couple of false starts later, we finally arrived at our destination and were promptly seated.

The York Street location reminds me a lot of TOCA over at the Ritz-Carlton - the ultra-modern, ritzy restaurant/patio that was designed around sharp edges and minimal profiles. We were a bit underdressed for the occasion (sporting more casual fare while women in low-cut miniskirts sidled up to the suited crowd at the bar), but the service was very attentive.

You can tell when someone understands good service, and our waitress had that mindset in spades, almost at a worker bee mentality. Constantly hovering around, refilling water and telling us a bit of history about the site itself, her comments lent themselves well to the atmosphere and quality of the experience.

I had eaten prior to arriving, so I ended up settling for a B-52 coffee and a slice of cheesecake. There wasn't much to the coffee and the cheesecake tasted somewhat unnaturally soft, but I enjoyed what I had overall. (Not so much afterward - the food went through me like a freight train and I had an uncomfortable experience afterwards.)

My friends all ended up going for the classics menu, ranging from the top sirloin to the prime rib, and they all reported that it was great across the board. Like I said, the staff certainly aim to be consistent in their presentation and taste, and they nailed it across the board.

After finding them on an internet search for prenatal services, I called and spoke to a couple of women.  After answering many of my questions over a few calls, I was ready to make an appt.  ask me what my choice of Dr was and I simply ask them to set me up with the one they preferred... enter, Dr. Gregory DeSanto.

I was always told that picking your maternity doctor was quite the chore.  It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.

The reason for taking away a star is that on both visits, I've felt there could be a lil more communication with the the ladies in the office.  The first visit, I told them on check-in that I had 2 appts and even wrote in the information on the sign-in sheet but, they never sent me down to my first appt.  I didn't know there's almost no wait time at this clinic, (unlike other doctor's offices) so I sat there waiting forever and finally ask when it was almost time for my 2nd appt. because I was afraid they were going to overlap.  Luckily, they were able to fit me in for my 1st appt after my 2nd appt but that whole situation could have easily been avoided with a lil more communication.  On the 2nd visit, after my weight/vitals check, I was told to that I needed to start a test but then she left me without any instructions on where to go or what to do after that test.  I think it was assumed I knew the drill already because I am in my 2nd trimester, but that was only my 2nd appt.  

Those lil glitches were barely noticeable though compared to the satisfaction I feel with the clinic overall.  

* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!

* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!

* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  

* There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.

I'll be back next month for my 6 month check-up!

The biscuit it came with was very dense and dry. 

My mom ordered the fried chicken benedict. You couldn't even tell it was a benedict, it was just a mountain of food piled together. It didn't even look appetizing. Lastly was the cobb salad which wasn't bad, but not great either.

The dish looked beautiful with the vibrant green colour of the gnocchi. 
However, when I cut into the halibut, it was cold on the inside, transparent, and difficult to cut into, just like a piece of raw fish.  I realized that the entire dish had cooled down significantly, the gnocchi was not warm when i bit into it. I am never the type to send a dish back to the kitchen and usually takes a lot for me to do so. I decided I'd ask my waitress, who indeed brought the dish back. After waiting what felt like 30 minutes (my partner had already polished off his burger and i was starving), the chef personally came by with a new dish (this time the gnocchi was actually warm), and handed it to me from over the fence. She proceeded to tell me this is how the fish is supposed to be (seriously? it was transparent and cold.!I know my raw fish. I love sashimi!).

This hotel has a loooooooong front desk area with over a dozen stations but they only have 2-3 employees working at any given time. Even if there are only 2 people in front of you in line, it will take 15 minutes to get to the front. It's so annoying. 

CHEAP KEY CARDS THAT GET DEMAGNETIZED EVERY DAY 
The elevator is super-slow. It seemed like every time I finally went up the elevator to my room, my key was demagnetized and I had to go back down to reception to get it fixed. And since I already explained how slow the employees are, you can imagine what a big hassle that was. 

LOW WATER PRESSURE 
The rainfall shower-head is nice but there's not enough water pressure. It reminded me of hotels in China. 

TERRIBLE SHAMPOO BOTTLE DESIGN 
I know, this is a minor complaint. The shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotion come in a tall skinny plastic bottle with a tops that ""click"" into place.

Um, NO! I checked in and no one said anything to me. 

NO ROOMS WITH 2 BEDS 
I was staying in a room with my friend (another girl) and it would've been convenient to have a room with 2 beds. But nope, all rooms at PH Towers have 1 bed and 1 pullout couch. With the pullout couch open, I could barely walk around the tiny room. 

ROOMS UNPREPARED 
Since we were utilizing the pullout couch, we needed sheets for the couch. Housekeeping said that it should've been in our closet but there were no sheets to be found. When I wanted to watch TV, I realized that the room didn't have a remote. I had accidentally left my toothbrush at home and I asked them to bring a toothbrush but apparently, the hotel doesn't have toothbrushes?!?!

The first time was a couple of years ago. I was a bit disappointed because my expectation was set too high based on my friend's' recommendation. The price was high and the taste was too salty. 

Due to the request of my friend, we revisited this place. I was hoping that the food quality can be improved no matter if they have changed the price or not. Unfortunately, it was fairly the same but if I'm to be honest, it is a bit worse. 

We ordered two types of pho. The first one was with the meat balls. The medium size order is good for a regular individual, but if you are very hungry, the large size is recommended. It seems like the noodles were immersed in the water for too long, they weren't chewy at all. The taste of the soup was very plain. The second pho was with vegetables. As you may see in the photo, it was pretty much the chopped vegetables were thrown on top of the pho, not pretty and I had no intention to try it.

It turned out an amazing decision!

This soup noodle restaurant is so good that I could start coming here every time I'm craving noodle soup.

I ordered the original broth soup noodles plus extra lamb ($2.99 for extra meat).  The soup came in a large deep bowl with delicious broth and the meat already cooking inside.  Then they bring you a big big bowl of noodle and a tray with at least ten topping.  You add the noodles and toppings into the soup and add seasoning to taste.

I liked all the toppings and added them into my soup, but saw other customer exchange a topping they did not like for another serving of one they liked.

The meal looks really easy to make (and probably is), but Oriental Rice noodle house provides a really valuable service making your broth and noodles and providing you with the all the variety of toppings ready to cook.  They do so with quick, efficient service and at a reasonable price.

Fantastic food, tremendous value and fast service making Oriental Rice Noodle House one of my new noodle restaurant favorites.  I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.

I just had my usual turkey with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and cheese, but there's something about the special dressing they use, or the combination of mayo and mustard, that gives it something different.

After experiencing the trash heap of disappointment that was Taco Guild earlier in the day, my wife and I went and drank our sorrows away around town, depressed that we didn't get a decent taco in a city filled with amazing tacos.  While drinking, we met a man who said he tended bar at Chico Malo, and told him about how shitty Taco Guild was.  He agreed and told us to go to Chico Malo and try it, that we wouldn't be disappointed, that they make amazing tacos the right way, tacos that will blow your mind.

After a few hours we had worked up a hunger and said ""Screw it. Let's go get some better tacos.""

The space is nice and open, indoor/outdoor bar is long and accommodating, it just feels more accessible than when it was The Corner.  We had some hopes because it was obvious the owners spent money on this joint.  

We ordered 3 tacos, I think it was the chicken tinga, the chorizo y papas and the crispy avocado.  They came out after a while on fresh made corn tortillas!  Then I went to take a bite of the chicken tinga...but first I had to remove the dill fronds from the top.  Seriously.  They put dill fronds on a taco.

Then I was mad.  It was sweet.  SWEET.  What the shit?  Ok, I thought, at least I ordered chorizo and potatoes, there's no way to fuck that up with sweetness.  I had had enough sweet bullshit tacos at Taco Guild, I needed something savory for once.  I don't know what the hell it is with these pseudo-taco places obviously pandering to white people, but they seem to believe that white people want nothing but sweet food.  White people, I don't know if that's true about you or not, but according to Taco Guild and Chico Malo, you're basically pure sugar.

Anyway, I bit into the chorizo y papa taco!  

IT'S SWEET.   Turns out they have a ""jalapeno marmalade"".  Because yeah, that's exactly what the perfect combination of chorizo and potato was missing:  marmalade.  You motherfuckers.

The crispy avocado taco was probably the best one but even that was kind of overloaded with cucumber, maybe more of a personal preference, but even without that it would have been completely forgettable.

I left this place in a hurry, mad and upset that I broke the cardinal taco rule TWICE in one day:  the nicer the place, the shittier the taco.

PS: These mofos have a carne asada taco with ENGLISH PEA GUACAMOLE.  God damnit.  Seriously, fuck you.  Why not just go buttfuck my dead grandmother in the grave with more of your jalapeno marmalade while you're out desecrating hispanic things?  

But I'm still nice and gave two stars because it's a nice place!  But I still hate you and your tacos, Chico Malo.   

PPS:  The tacos are $5 a piece.  I'm not cheap either, so I usually don't give a shit if something is higher priced than it should be so long as I'm getting something fantastic for that price.  Instead I got trash heap fusion food from some dickbag conglomerate of corporate food-thinkers that probably cobbled this menu together from a list of foodie buzzwords and kitschy trend-aggregator instagram accounts or something.

ddoNyoESM1GxIoiF0wUSjQ,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,d_q4avZYM1sOlQP7noJKVg,5,7,2,4,"About a decade ago while visiting some old college buddies in Tucson, my former college roommate took me out to lunch at El Guero Canelo's original location.  Despite the myriad of choices for Mexican food in Tucson, he insisted we go there for what he promised would be some of the best Carne Asada I'd ever have.  He was right.  I got a plate full of it and a Mexican Coke and I was a happy boy.  I've since visited El Guero in Tucson a couple of times, but its been at least a couple of years since my last.  Additionally, I'd never tried their much hyped Sonoran Hot Dog during any of those visits.  In fact I'd all but forgotten El Guero and the fact that they'd opened a location in the Phoenix not long ago.  But then the news dropped that El Guero had won a James Beard Award for their Sonoran Hot Dog creation.  The light bulb immediately went on in my head and drove me straight to El Guero for a Sunday lunch.

You'll find El Guero just a stone's throw from the I-10 on the southwest corner of 51st Avenue & McDowell.  While it may seem odd for such a famous restaurant to park themselves in the Maryvale neighborhood, it mirrors the same business model as their Tucson locations.  Each of their locations are purposely placed in predominantly Latino neighborhoods, making Maryvale the perfect spot for their Phoenix operation.  Much like their Tucson locations, the interior is open and expansive with tons of seating, lots of room to move about, and a simple front counter to place your order.  I believe this particular building used to be a Discount Tire garage before it was converted.  The line can get long (though quick moving) during the busiest hours, but today I got lucky and was second in line upon arrival.

While I was tempted to get some that Carne Asada again today, I opted to go with a different lineup.  First and foremost, I got the award winning Sonoran Hot Dog.  A hot dog is first bacon wrapped and fried, then placed inside El Guero's own homemade bread roll, then topped with beans, onions, diced tomatoes, mustard, pureed jalapeños and mayo.  I also decided to give their small Caramelo a try.  Think of this almost like a Mexican spin on a flatbread sandwich with two tortillas (in my case, corn) bookending beans (in my case, refried), slices of cooked meat (in my case, chicken) and lots of melted cheese.  Lastly for my beverage, I opted for one of their Mangoyadas. Basically a mango slushee mixed with spicy Chamoy sauce (made from a type of pickled fruit) and Tajin (a Mexican spice consisting of chiles, lime, and salt).  Total cost for everything including tax came to $13.

After munching down on that Sonoran hot dog, I can definitely understand why this hot dog is so famous.  But I gotta say that for me, the superstar of the dish is the bread.  It has the texture of a super soft savory baguette but is firm enough to hold all those ingredients in place.  I'm not sure what their secret is, but wow.  And yes, the combo of all those ingredients on top of the hot dog (including bacon) are heavenly.  Tucson made it famous, but mad props to the kids in Hermosillo who dreamed up this creation.  The Caramelo was also super satisfying.  Very generous portion for a ""small"" size with lots of chicken and delicious melted cheese.  The Mangoyada was the perfect vehicle to wash down all that food with a cold slightly tart and slightly spicy flavor to keep my tastebuds happy throughout.

Nowadays Sonoran hot dogs can be found everywhere around town (and I fully plan on trying those out too), but El Guero founder Daniel Contreras can be rightly credited with making it famous and giving birth to its growth as an Arizona icon.  El Guero also has all the usual staples you'd expect like tacos, burros, tortas, and even a salsa bar inside.  But perhaps the best part about El Guero (at least in my opinion) is that it's made this sleepy corner of Maryvale a destination for people of all walks of life.  In addition to seeing Latinos, I saw plenty of gringos and people of other backgrounds coming in and out throughout my meal.  And why not?  Great food at cheap prices with a few items you can't find just anywhere.  It's something Maryvale could use a lot more of.  For now, its great to have El Guero Canelo here in town.  Or rather make that James Beard Award winner El Guero Canelo.",2018-01-28 19:52:27

I never given this place any thought, but from now on I'll be using more of my head, because I loved this place.

This is hardly a cafe, as there are never people here solely drinking coffee or stealing WIFI. This is more on the sides of what Macau people eat, with Hong Kong style dishes and drinks. The food by far one of the cleanest anywhere in this plaza. 
The food is delicious, the typically named teriyaki chicken with rice doesn't taste so typical, the curry beef brisket comes with big chucks of meat on steamed rice. Most main entries (if not all) comes with a free drink. 
Booth/stall seating along the walls, and table seating on the dining floor.
The decor is colour, this is as complicated as it gets. No expenses spared for ambiance. No need in my opinion, well lit and well cooked food is enough, and they got that.

I brought my Iranian friend Arrash here, and he didn't understand what was happening. I told him that this was apart of the collective culinary diversity of China, despite not looking like the typical chicken balls and sandwich fried rice or whateverthehell he was used to. He loved it, and so the two of us men awkwardly said little to each other during the course of food munching. Because that's what guys do at restaurants, we eat. 
The food did take over ten minutes of wait, but that just assures me the food is being relatively freshly prepared. 
The service is not very engaging, I would liked to have chatted with our waitress just a little bit. But the burly who was also serving food offered the same service, and so I was happy that this was the standard, just in case I got him the next time.

A very unassuming restaurant that dishes up some truly simple but great food, and it's all at a very reasonable price. I stress that this place has some very reasonable prices!

I should have came here earlier, but like it says in the Bible; those who are first come last, and..those who are last..come first or something like that. This place is now my first choice at Leslie Plaza. Amen to that!

I had to make a decision whether to go their or AJ's this week.  I have to tell you Jersey Mike's had two strikes against it before I walked in there so I almost didn't.   I am not a big sub person.  Usually the bread is satisfactory but that is about it.  The second strike is most places that advertise themselves as being from a specific area offer a product  you really have to develop a taste for  if you are ever really going to enjoy it.  Maybe if you are from there... ?  I was about that far from not going in...

I am glad that I did.  They don't offer all the toppings one might find at the other large chains. Only two kinds of bread?  The difference is in the quality of what they do offer.  That by far makes up the difference.  I had a toasted veggie wrap and really enjoyed it.  Everything was fresh and crisp without an overpowering ranch dressing.  Nice fresh bread that tasted like it had been baked that day.  Enough to fill you up without making you feel stuffed.  I have no problems with the thought of going back.  

One more plus for Jersey Mike's.  I had to wait longer than I expected.  When I finally did get my order, I mentioned it was my first time there.  I was immediately told they were shorthanded and got an apology for having had to wait as long as I did.  That really impressed me as they were really busy and it was genuine, not lip service.

In the warmer months they open up their full length front windows onto the street, but i'm sure come snowfall it'll be cozy inside with your friends and a drink.

There's a pretty standard fare as far as drinks go here - but they do have a non-Strongbow option for cider, which I am thankful for! (Sir Perry.) They have beer specials also, and dead cheap pitchers of sangria for sharing with chums. 

Food-wise they have a terrific kind of diner/bar hybrid menu (and they serve til 2am!). Apps, salads, sammiches, burgers, hotdogs - and every single section has vegetarian and vegan options.

I have been to Ticoz a number of times, and really the only reason I return is due to a friend inviting me to go to breakfast or, like the last time we were here, their birthday dinner. The first time I came here was almost 4 years ago, and the last was about a month ago for a birthday. All experiences about the same - actually, no - I'd say they have progressively gotten worse. 

I know it is a popular spot, and I won't argue with someone who loves this place, but I find it a bit confused and overpriced for the quality. It's cute, I suppose, for a CenPho spot. (I may be putting down some CenPho spots that really make the effort!). But I would have to say the food and drinks here are about as tacky as the interior decorating. I cannot remember having anything I really felt was worth finishing the plate here. I had a chicken burrito last time which was pretty bland, served with some sort of BBQ/refried beans that confused my mouth and the rest of the dish. I will say, I like the little cornbread/cake scoop you get on your plate. The most memorable thing I have have eaten here. 

We also ordered their flavored Sangria pitcher ($25!!!)...a huge pitcher that is really just about 3 glasses total due to the amount of ice they use in both the pitcher and the glasses, and tasted like grown-up KoolAid as if the flavor came from some sort of Pucker's additive. Actually, I remember going to Ticoz for the first time for their Martini night and I had to send back 2 of them because that's all they were, vodka and Pucker's. Gross. 

This last time we were here, for the friend's birthday dinner, we had a large group and were sat in the corner booths. Seating was fine, we knew we were a large group, but we felt like we were a burden for the server and felt more processed than really served. I mean, from my experience in service, you work a large group for a tip but our server had zero personality with us and made me feel like I was on a field trip, not at a birthday party at an adult restaurant. 

My last last review (for TeePee's) actually cited this experience. We dined at TeePee's Friday, and then Ticoz Saturday for the party and we both highly agreed that, though they are very different in ambiance, style, food, etc., we would much rather go and eat at TeePee's again, spend half the amount of money and enjoy ourselves.

I recommend the babaghannouj dip, hummus dip, tabouli and the tzatziki dip and for an entree, the falafel platter.  It comes with either french fries or rice, tabouli and a pita, so you get a ton of delicious food.

Chili's food in general compared to other foods?  I gave it 3 stars.  I've never had chili from Chili's so I thought I'd give it a try.  Meh.  We got their 3 appetizer as well and it was yummy.

wrDeKBEZ8yrauFBFwoeSwg,mTo09gWr5rRB8vNFFtyI3A,3dw6xhzG08htY5HcL2OjeA,4,8,0,2,"Okay, as Cajun woman living in East Mesa, I have eagerly been awaiting the opening of this place 1/4 mile from my home. My husband and I came in opening night. Overall, I think this place is amazing; I do have some other feedback, as well. 

First of all: The place is huge. I didn't realize it was that big. It's great there's lots of space, plenty of sports on. It was very clean and you can write on the wall, which is fun. I meant to ask for a Sharpie, but I forgot; next time.  Jazz filled the air, which I love, but I also hope to hear some zydeco played, in the future. 

The table of people near us were quite loud and, a few times, invasive. This is not a reflection on the establishment itself, but it did take away from the enjoyment of the experience. 

Noel was our server, and he was friendly and attentive. He answered any questions we had with ease, and displayed a positive attitude. 

My husband ordered the Abita Amber. I chose not to drink this time, but I'm so happy to have some Abita options close by. What was definitely lacking was SWEET TEA.  I fully expected a restaurant like this would have it, and was very disappointed they do not serve sweet tea. Please change that!!!!

Of course, one of the things I was most excited about was having my favorite food in the whole world - boiled crawfish (surely to be a staple on heaven's banqueting table). We ordered it and were told they had run out. That was a real bummer. I have grace for this because it was around 9pm when we arrived, and I'm sure they had been quite busy on opening day. Still, I had a moment of mourning. 

We placed an order for hushpuppies. The flavors were amazing and highly approved by this Cajun. However, they were obviously cooked in grease that was too hot, as the outside was brown and crispy as it should be, but the inside was quite mushy. I'd be happy to give these another chance (again, the flavors are spot on), but I beg of you to watch the temperature of the grease. They are served with ranch (a dish typically served with remoulade), which I found to be an odd choice, but with the flavors, they don't really need a dipping sauce. 

We ordered a fried catfish basket to share. The portion of Cajun fries is very generous, and they are quite tasty. We ordered BBQ beans as the second side, and I would definitely recommend those, as well. The catfish, while not terrible, left some to be desired. I personally prefer thin-sliced catfish, and this piece was quite large. The breading was good, but it was also obvious the filet had been frozen at some point. I will refrain from ordering the catfish in the future. 

Since there was no crawfish, we ordered some boiled shrimp, Trifecta, of course (totally recommend) and Medium (to gauge the spice levels). I love spicy, but I have to be careful late at night. Personally, I found Trifecta + Medium to be PERFECT for shrimp. When I next go and order crawfish, I'll probably knock the spice up a notch or two. Amazing flavors, beautiful shrimp. My only complaint here is they were put into the plastic bag at a very high temperature, and when you do that with shrimp, they start to get mushy. Several of our shrimp were mushy, as a result. 

Again, amazing experience overall; just a few adjustments could be made. Fingers crossed there's an abundance of crawfish when I return. 

Thank you for coming to East Mesa!",2016-11-05 05:26:55

The food is decent and a cut above regular pub fare, and I have no compunction about getting totally sloshed here. The layout is a bit schizophrenic: restaurant to the right, expansive bar to the left, but they pull it off well. I was wary of their ability to showcase live music when I was there Saturday night but it was a success.

Obligatory Title Pun: More like: prohi-BITCHIN'!

Menu Readability: They changed it from a broadsheet to a book, but it's still all right.  Even though it's not a franchise, everything has a polished corporate look about it.  

Need to mention: Music was excruciatingly loud in the back room where we sat.  Management did not let up until the problem was fixed. Kudos!

We had a get together of approximately 30 people. The man who was taking care of our tables was very nice and polite, despite the overwhelming number of orders he probably had to take from us. I have no idea how he was able to keep a smile on his face dealing with such a big group, but nonetheless, he was very hospitable.

As for the food, it was all very delicious. The main highlights were probably the ramen and ginger milk. If you come here and do not try the Ginger Milk, you are missing out! It tastes pretty much like dau fu fa (hot tofu pudding) but with a kick of ginger in it. It was very yummy, and nice and warm. A very relaxing dessert after the bloatedness of consuming all the buffet food. Another dessert I really enjoyed was the Mango Yogurt. It was actually very light and milky, yet not too sweet. It was so good that I had to get another one.

The only thing that really hindered the experience was how they kept forgetting to bring some of our orders. Also, whenever they came around and brought the food to our table, we were left guessing which dish was what, and sometimes we had to ask twice before they either gave us a response, or just looked at us with confusion.

I feel like this place could really benefit from the use of iPad ordering or at least using the checklist sheet where people can mark off what they want. Having to tell the server what we wanted every time was kind of a hassle.

To be honest though, I don't know if I would come here too often for dinner on the weekends. The price is pretty expensive for what you get.",2016-02-22 18:31:15

The parking lot is as big as its neighbor's -   Target.  It's right off the 215 freeway and Decatur in North Vegas, just north of this new growing sin city suburb. I went on St. Patrick's Day, two weeks after the first day of Grand Opening, and customers were plenty. and plenty happy.  The woman in line ahead of us said that she's probably going to abandon Wal Mart and start coming here. Wal Mart, a few miles from here, so far has been very crowded but maybe that will change..

If you like size, variety, and a place to get a walk in while shopping, this box-like store without a membership is for you.  There will be almost 200 employees with new jobs, so that's good.  It's also 92,000 square feet, open 24 hours, is bright inside, and has things you don't find in discount stores, like grind your own peanut butter- though I didn't see that.  There were also bulk pet foods, lots of bulk candies and snacks, and brewed coffee samples next to the 20 or so bulk coffee varieties. On the down side, it's so big you things might be hard to find. I wasn't the only lost shopper, as others paced up and down looking for signs describing the aisle's items. Several minutes later, I found an employee with a list of items and their locations. And, you have to bag your own groceries, so in that sense, it's like a Food 4 less. Beware those shopping carts are giant,
big enough to put your St. Bernard in (dogs aren't allowed in the store, though!)

So you grab a huge cart, and notice the front door specials are nuts....well, it depends on the week but besides cheap peanuts this week, there were Cheerios for under $2.00, bacon for $2.99 a pound with no limit, and other low priced things like 3 twelve pack of Pepsi products for $10, etc.  It changes weekly.

Then you step into the produce department, and find a decently stocked, colorful department including 5 varieties of apples for less than $2 a lb. Honeydew Melons are not much cheaper at 99 cents a pound than other places, though they even had some hard to find things like plums and nectarines from Chile for $2.50 a lb.  Not everything is cheap, but a lot of it is.  We didn't buy any meat today, but there were pretty good prices, definitely cheaper overall that Albertson's but more close to Wal Mart Neighborhood Market. There is also a Smith's a few miles from here, so the shopping choices are good for this hood. 

Overall, I'm a fan though stores like this hopefully don't get ghetto like most Wal Marts eventually do. When I visit relatives here again this summer when the temperatures are over 100 degrees, I'll be inside getting my exercise while shopping in the cool new store.

This is the closest location to my house and it's still about 15 minutes away (all streets) but damnit, I love this place.  I ordered about 25 wings (4 different flavors) and two sides of fries online on a Wednesday night and the site said 20 minutes.  Honestly, I didn't believe it.  But I drove over there and it was actually being bagged as I walked in the door.

Awesome. Just awesome.  Easy parking, super-friendly staff, very clean location and it looked like they had some great dine-in specials with beer.

Online they had a special for 60 cents per boneless wing, minimum 5, which is pretty good in my opinion.  I don't know if this is a consistent thing or not.

The french fries had much less sugar than I was used to, which certainly made me sad but they were still good with their delicious ranch sauce.

Their Louisiana rub packs quite a punch!  I think it's by far the hottest - Atomic is a joke compared to it.  Their Teriyaki is also still on point, and their BBQ was good to try once but I'm just not a huge fan of BBQ on chicken wings (I got some because I was sharing with friends who had never had Wing Stop).

I've stopped by Red Lobster restaurants in other towns and have been overwhelmed by delightful, positive experiences, so I thought I'd give the local one a try.

When I went on a weekend night packed with other customers, I was concerned about wait time but fortunately my party was seated almost immediately.  With so many patrons vying for the attention of their servers, we were overlooked and felt we got the cold shoulder because of our age (a young college group).  

The interior is old and ragged, which conveniently fits the ""shipwreck"" theme.  We were pushed into a dark corner (intended to be ""romantic lighting,"" I think), but I could still make out the wear on our seats and the carpet.

For dinner, I ordered one of their ""daily catches"" and had it cooked on the grill.  The fish was bland, unmemorable, and did not justify the cost; the only flavor came from the lemon that I judiciously squeezed on top.  As for my side dish, I was horrified by my broccoli.  It had been cooked beyond redemption, with each bud shriveled and blackened.  The saving grace of the meal was the biscuits (crunchy outside, hot and buttery inside), which have been consistently good between all of the Red Lobsters I have visited.

At the end of the meal, the bill for my boyfriend and I came out to about $40 (including tip).  Not a happy customer.",2010-11-14 03:20:28

The Angus patty was cooked medium to borderline medium -well, but still juicy. Not a ton of seasoning to the meat.  All the traditional burger toppings (minus cheese) are available for ""free"", so at $4.95, this is a seriously delicious burger for a good deal.

Save room for dessert because the gelato is de-licious! A small is only $3.95, and I loved that I was still able to choose 2 flavours (there are about 15 in total), or 3 for the medium cup at a $1 more! Worth the extra 15 minutes on the treadmill, I reckon. The salted caramel was my favourite. The pistachio was the most true-to-nut of all pistacho-flavoured gelatos I've had, and the mojito had real mint in it, which was very refreshing after a oniony burger.

Only drawback - we waited an easy 15 minutes for our burgers with only one other patron in the joint. Not a place I'd come on a weekday or if I were in a rush. But luckily it was a lazy Saturday, and I shall be back very soon!",2013-05-05 02:26:30

It was crowded, but fine and inside the restaurant was almost empty.  We ordered a bowl of soup, flatbread, arugula salad and chicken meatballs.  We asked our waiter to bring everything out at once so we could share.  We then waited over 30 minutes for our soup and salad to arrive.  Ouch.  Every table around us was being served while we watched and wondered where our remaining items were (meatballs and flatbread).  And we waited. And we waited. Without apology, our last two items showed up after the salad and soup were long gone--at least 30 min later.  By then it was over the acceptable wait time and the patio chairs became uncomfortable and the other patron's smoke started to annoy us.  We had intended to go in for a few appetizers and got stuck in service hell.   In hindsight, I should've spoken with the manager but we were in a hurry to get out of there.  Enough was enough.

We arrived slightly early and were encouraged to get a drink at the bar, which we did. It took quite a while to get the bartender's attention, but we did, got ourselves a few cocktails and took a seat in the lounge area (which is really just a bench seat with some tables between the bar and the host stand). We were shown to our seats a few minutes late, but that was ok. 

Our server Rebecca was fantastic. She was friendly and sweet, and helped us by immediately telling us the specials which were running low, in case we wanted any reserved. We ordered a starter of mussels and oysters, which arrived promptly and tasted amazing. It was the first time I've ever tasted the sea in an oyster, and my date is still talking about his mussels a week later. He was surprised that they arrived chilled, but got over it and loved them. My date ordered a side of the macaroni & cheese, which was fantastic. At least two or three cheeses, smooth and creamy. I ordered the daily special of cream of cauliflower soup. It was smooth, salty and fresh.

For our main dishes, my date requested his litmus test dish of French fare: steak frites, and I ordered the special of the day, monk fish. The fish was splendid. Meaty, perfectly prepared with a sauce that didn't overpower it, it just helped it. Wonderful. My date wasn't very happy with his steak, however. It seemed tough, and rather than the traditional tender, thin cut his steak was quite thick. 

The sommelier helped us tremendously with his wine suggestions, but considering some of the prices of the glasses which, admittedly would have best suited the meal, we went with lesser priced glasses (which went just fine). 

For dessert my date ordered his favorite, creme brulee, and I ordered the namesake dessert, bouchons. We were too full to fully enjoy them, but they were beautiful and the handmade ice cream was fantastic.

Our service was excellent, the atmosphere romantic and intimate. The prices were truly not as high as expected. We were encouraged to return for breakfast but were not able to.

After looking over the menu I ordered the following for us to try: bean & cheese burrito, chicken pollo fundido, beef fajita combo plate & a cheese quesadilla w/a side of sour cream. Since I was taking it to go I forgot to grab some salsa from the salsa bar, next time!

I had half of the bean & cheese burro & about a third of the pollo fundido for my lunch, I can't decide which was better as they were both so good! My hubby split the bean & cheese burro w/me & ate the cheese quesadilla w/sour cream, he also loved the burro & said the quesadilla was good too, not greasy like most places.

It was a Saturday evening movie started at 8 theater 21..yes they have 25 theaters here that's how big the place is. 
So we bought our tickets first stop is the bathroom, the bathrooms are really nice as the theater is fairly new. Although the bathrooms are nice they are extremely dirty. 
Toilet paper everywhere, left over human waste in the toilets, water all over the counters, etc.
My bf came out and mentioned how gross the mens bathrooms were as well.
After that we went to the concessions to buy food, popcorn is pre made in large batches which is weird cause on a busy Saturday night you'd think they would make fresh popcorn constantly. Nope chewy old popcorn is what we received, but the cashier was a nice teenager didn't seem happy but she wasn't rude or anything.
This location also has the coca cola machines where you pour your own drinks w hundreds of options. the table for you to put your stuff on while you pour your drink was all wet w pop and straw wrappers/napkins and stuff. the pop spilled on the counter was all wet and sticky some was stained w means they obviously don't clean it too often. I mean there was even fruit flies , such a turn off.
Finally we find our theater and the previews are nearly the end but the place is full of kids or teens whatever they are still talking and using their phones. Even during the movie this continued . They had their feet on the seats in front of them passing food back and forth jumping up n down on the chairs and being overly obnoxious laughing and making so much noise. I was so not impressed. I mean there had to be like 20 of them in each group.
I mean I know its not the fault of the Cineplex but from what other people said this is a regular thing. so ye i wont be returning again.

My party ordered a variety of pasta dishes:
- Tuscan Pesto
- Basilicata
- Ravioli Rose
- Duck Bolognese

All were reasonably priced - that is, until we acknowledged the small portion size and the congruent flavour among all the dishes that screamed that it tasted like something pre-packaged and ''out of the box''.  

You also get a plate of small dinner rolls for free to start your meal.  This is always appreciated to help one stave off their hunger, but be prepared to have whipped butter packages instead of whipped butter in a dish. This isn't usual, but it does enhance the fact that the restaurant is not high end and instead just a pleasant spot for lunch/dinner.

Lovely seat by a window in a relatively private booth.
Service was attentive and expedient. However, there was a bit of disdain in the waiter's voice when we inquired about the daily specials (as laid out on the website and menu) as well as the soup of the day. All had run out for the day :( According to the waiter we should have been there by noon to have any expectation of trying a special :(

I ordered the jerk chicken caesar salad - an interesting take on a classic. It was made more interesting by the addition of corn and beans (not something I would have put on my salad, and I probably won't be replicating this at home). 

Both the chicken on my salad and the fish order by my colleague were dry - as though they were prepared for the noon rush and merely leftover when we arrived at 1pm. I guess the silver lining is that our meals were on the table much more quickly than expected.

Over all, this experience was a little below my expectations for the location, prices, and reputation. Perhaps I will give Jump another try when it isn't the end of a shift in order to try the specials and find a more congenial waiter.

We tried the prosciutto pizza which was tasty and we tried the fig and spicy pancetta pizza with a balsamic drizzle which was by far my favourite between the two. Perfect mix of salty and sweet :) and not necessarily a flavour combo you will find everywhere. My only complaint was the seating outside was a pretty tight squeeze -I would have liked more room between the tables but it didn't have a negative effect on my experience other than the fact that it got pretty loud with everyone so close together but wasn't a big deal.

After walking around with my BF and not finding anything that caught our attention, I suggested we go to L&L afterwards to eat instead. He agreed since we were heading to our friends house in East Mesa and it was on the way. 

It was the first time for me at this location and the first time for my BF at an L&L, so we were hoping it was not a let down. We were starving by this time since we skipped the food at the festival. I had been to L&Ls in Cali and Hawaii and figured they all had to be the same. I remembered that their Katsu sauce wasn't that great but nothing too bad where I wouldn't order it. 

To my surprise, this L&L was better than the ones in Cali and HI. The Katsu sauce is really good here; it's similar to the one at my favorite Hwaiian place (not an L&L) in LA that I used to frequent. I also had some of their Kalua pork and it was moist and tasty.  

I'm so glad we did not eat at the festival. We would've spent more and had to sit on the ground or stand to eat and it probbaly wouldn't have been as satisfying.

How do I contain my excitement in writing this review.. okay I won't. I was SO OBSESSED with Flamin' when they were at their first location by Montford. They had to close that location and I've been yearning for them to come back ever since. Finally.. HERE WE ARE! I believe they've been open for less than a month now and I've been 3 times, possibly 4. If they were closer to me, it would probably be most of the week. I will organize this review based on types of food and my recommendations! Let's go!

Seafood Boils (Crawfish, Crab (Blue, Snow, and Dungeness), Mussels, Shrimp, Clams and Lobster):
My FAVORITE part is definitely the seafood boils. Step one is pick your preferred seafood. They are priced by the pound (MP). Decide how many pounds you want, then choose the flavor and level of spiciness! I alternate between crawfish or shrimp, but I always the Flamin' Special flavor, Hot on the spicy level and a side of rice to eat with the sauce. It's amazing! I've also tried the Garlic Butter flavor and it's delicious. 

Soups:
I haven't had the chance to try their pho yet, but I have tried a couple of their soups. My favorite is the Banh Canh. I would also recommend the Canh Bun. Both are traditional Vietnamese soups and they do a good job with both. 

Fruit Teas & Dessert:
They have a wide variety of fruit teas with bits of jelly and fruits throughout the drink. All very delicious and also very refreshing! My favorite is the Passion Love and Mango Madness. They also offer milk teas and dessert drinks. The dessert drinks are traditional Vietnamese desserts (also known as che). My favorite is the Che Thap Cam which has red tapioca, grass jelly, pandan jelly and coconut milk. YUM!

A couple of kinks: slow service and a long wait on food. They did just open a month ago and have a huge influx of people that come through, so it's understandable, but I believe I waited 45 minutes last time for food after ordering. They do run out of various things throughout the week, but I'm giving them time to adjust. I believe in you and naturally, I'll be back!",2017-07-18 14:56:08

The service was top notch.   Our host and server Derrick (I'm awful with names but I *think* that was he said his name was) was informative, attentive and extremely friendly.  He didn't even flinch when I took one look at the uber-busy dining room and asked if we could sit outside instead (I shy away from crowded places) and he went out of his way to take great care of us tonight.  He gave us great service, and I am very critical about service standards.  (I mystery shopped for several years, it's to be expected from me...lol!)

The food was wonderful and because we were both new to the dish of Pho, Derrick was very informative, instructing us on the proper way to season our soups and how it's eaten.

The spring rolls were very good, I got the seared tuna roll and my husband got the vegetarian Buddha roll.  

And the ginger creme brulee we split for dessert was delicious!   The ginger flavor was really intriguing and the sugar crust was perfect.

Dinner with my husband made it extra special! :-)

The one and only drawback to this place is the stucktastic parking situation.  They really need to move to a bigger place where they'll have more parking.  It is hard to even get a spot here.  

So, other than having to park across the street and walk over, we had a wonderful dinner and I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner.

I procrastinated registering my car this time and it came time to get off my booty to do something about it.  The DMV is kind of out of my way hence the reason for the procrastination.  My only intention was to hit up the kiosk in the front and be done with this tedious annual event all together.  Two 24 hour kiosk are located outside for convenience.  HOWEVER both kiosks are not in working order.  No signs posted.  Just a few people trying to dodge the sun versus the screen to figure out that the kiosks weren't even on. 

So the journey continues as we walk into this unappealing establishment where no one wants to be.  There is a line from the front desk all the way to the door today.  I've witnessed it being a lot shorter in the past.  We surpass the lines and walk through with our destination unknown searching for another kiosk in working order.   Looking around the big open room I see continued misery on the faces of the people waiting in boredom for their numbers to be called.  I swear almost every seat was occupied.  Thank goodness it wasn't me!

Low and behold there it was with a few people in line.  Yay!  That burst of sunshine just got clouded as the line dissolved right before my eyes. The bi-standers hung their heads low walking off in discouragement and disgust as they probably were procrastinators too with a mission.  I hurry myself to the kiosk and the screen has all kinds of jibber jabber stating that the machine was offline!  Are you serious right now?  Point is how ridiculous to have THREE kiosks not working AT the DMV-not very convenient!

What a blow to my get-off-my-ass-procrastination-bubble just now.  POP!!!

As I decided to procrastinate a little more (I know-good God right?) I make the decision to process my registration online and just wait for it to come in the mail....even though my sticker on my plate is now EXPIRED.  I should be better at these things.  SMH

After speaking with a friend she mentioned that she always registers her cars at Albertsons.  Wait What?  Albertsons?  YES!  Though I am going way out of my way one more time to kill my procrastination bleeding it is definitely worth the drive than to get pulled over for expired plates!  There it was ....a new working self service kiosk located right inside the front of the store! Two minutes later I was back in my car headed to the next destination!  Amen!

Moral of the story is: Don't bleed to death of procrastination when clearly there are more convenient ways to not get your hands dirty and not wait for a lousy number to be called!  Who knew?!

First you gotta order a drink, and lo and behold I see Hentai in the wild. I'm already a fan of old fashioned, but the meme level hilarity made me order that without question. Arguably, squid ink really does work, plus you gotta love the added touch of a well-suited Pokemon card.

But man, it's all a kids meal compared to the ramen. I got the OBON since I'm a big fan of the black garlic. You have the rich, fatty tonkotsu broth that you'd want from a hearty bowl. The pork was all super succulent and flavor. The MVP is clearly the egg - which was a perfect marriage between an onsen and soft-boiled egg. I first balked at how someone would pay $1.50 for an extra egg, but since this is the BEST EGG EVER I've experienced in ramen, I would clearly do it. The serving size is pretty generous to boot as well.

Some of the tapas are good as well. I was a big fan of the baos - the soft shell crab in that pillowy bun was a great appertif. I'm sad my phone died halfway through for pictures, but I can't wait to bring friends here for round 2.",2017-11-16 18:14:04

The atmosphere is generally laid back and comfortable, which is not common for a lot of stores.  They offer a wide and often eclectic selection.

Now, I've noticed a few comments that are a bit toward the negative side due to not having many items bought.  After having traded with this company for years at many locations, I can tell you, or in some cases confirm, a few points.  

When making an offer they look for items that they think will sell (it is a business, not a charity, after all) as well as items that they do not have a large stock of.  They are human, so one buyer may have a slightly different opinion of what looks good or what they consider overstocked so if at first you do not succeed, give it another go if you're in the area in a couple weeks.  

They may not have needed it today, but things, if even the buyer, may be different next time around and you may very well get something closer to what you want.

The staff is often friendly and helpful.  I've seen them bend over backwards to help me get what I want.  I've seen a few folks have off days but, again, we're all human.  The few visits that have not been stellar have been made up for time and time again.  

I'm very much a fan and rate Bookmans Mesa 4 out of 5 stars for being pretty dang good at what they do and for being one of the greener companies out there.",2011-03-10 04:03:06

Our server was very pleasant, and the woman she was training was helpful and kept up with coffee re-fills.

In all honesty, I don't know why people line-up to get breakfast from this joint. Nothing spectacular on the menu in m y opinion.... 

Second story (from my husband so I know its true).... he went there door-busting Sunday morning, after a long night out. Although they were the first people waiting at the door, and were there about 20 minutes before they opened, another group of people strolled up in front of them right at opening and were seated first. These people were then served first, and it took almost 45 minutes for my husband and his group of friends to get their food. They are guessing the group that cavalierly cut in front of them was a group of regulars.

Highly praised by locals and viewed from the highway on my Monday to Wednesday commute the lone factor preventing me from visiting Olivier Brouillet's ""Baguette Café"" to date was the weekday only hours, an understandable choice given the restaurant's business-park locale but a pity for those living within the somewhat Un-Vegasy constraints of a 7:30a-5:00p Monday through Friday schedule.  Small in size but airy in décor it was just after eight o'clock on a PTO Monday with family in town that our trio made way into the brightly lit room and with a few locals lingering over coffee as fresh baked goods stocked a small pastry case it was mere seconds before Olivier greeted us with a smile, our affirmation to his ""first time?"" inquiry leading to a full description of nearly every item ready or soon to emerge from the kitchen and our eventual order comprising the majority of them.  Admittedly intrigued by the sandwiches but preferring to focus on pastry it was with mild disappointment that Illy was the only brew offered as I find their over-roasted beans poorly suited for much but with this small quibble aside the glut soon to arrive would by-and-large impress, the simple  croissant on par with those of Paris as shattering layers gave way to echoing caverns of butter while four items laced with high quality chocolate each proved superlative - the crispy rimmed cookie near-molten at its core and the torte rich in taste but ethereal in texture.  Not quite as impressive or diverse as Bonjour Bakery, La Belle Terre, or Thomas Keller's Bouchon but featuring a combination of great pastry and lovely service that sets it apart Baguette Café is every bit the local gem that many have claimed and although hours and coffee will prevent frequent visits I've no doubt I'll find my way back eventually if not for a full meal at least for thing; an almond financier beyond my superlatives warrants any presumed hassles of location or time, even rush-hour on the 215.",2014-05-02 13:55:16

I really do like the library, and I go to museums. I went to the State Museum for the second time today for the opening of their Mid-Century Modern exhibit, a collection of Jay Florian Mitchell photographs of Las Vegas architecture.

The exhibit contains about 100 photographs of everything from homes to chapels to coffee shops and is a nice little jaunt through some of the best Las Vegas mid-century modern buildings. I appreciated that the pictures came with addresses allowing you to imagine where the building originally stood. Several of the buildings are actually still standing. The exhibit space is a bit crowded, so it would probably be even more enjoyable to go on a quieter day when you wouldn't have to dodge and weave. For $4 it isn't a big budget demand.

I also took the opportunity to swing back through some of the permanent exhibits. Yes, there is taxidermy, but I skipped that for more Las Vegas history. One lap around the permanent installation covering Las Vegas of days past and you will have a sound understanding of the city from the land auction through to atomic testing. It is much quicker than reading a book, and it comes with pictures! 

The museum is not the fanciest or the biggest, but for $4, it's a good way to pass a lazy afternoon (if you like history and stuff). Once the thermometer climbs above 100, it will be an even more attractive option.",2010-04-25 00:52:26

I've popped by in the past to pick up coffee or a pastry of some sort but I can't say it left a had to go back for either. 

This time I had an opportunity to try the food for summerlicious.  I usually try to avoid restaurants during this time of year because the food I see isn't necessarily on the menu. However when the peeps want to go here, what else can you do? Girl, has got to eat.

The overall highlight was the kale Caesar salad and a mock tail called seedless sipper. Both tasty and had I stopped there I'm sure this would have had a better review. The Main dish, the steak tip was hard to chew, over cooked and highly acidic.  I like a bit of acid but it just wasn't balanced enough.

What killed me and all of us at the table was the s'mores dessert. I have to say, it was one of the worst things I've eaten in awhile. All six of us tried it and no one enjoyed it.

To say that the food taste bad is not fair, it taste ok. Except, I think they can do so much better. The staff are from Malaysia so I know they can serve the real stuff.

The pros - quiet, decent office staff, plenty of space and storage, beautiful grounds, unique floor plans, close to North Mountain Park. 
That being said, upon move out, I must tell prospective tenants to think twice before renting here. I was willing to overlook the cons because all apartment complexes have their weaknesses. This one is in a sketchy area with very interesting individuals. Parking is extremely poor. The gates are always broken. Maintenance does the best they can and respond quickly, but expect to have the same appliances and fixtures repaired several times over. 
And here is the kicker - upon move out, we were hit with a $229.50 fee. After two weeks of communicating with office staff, the breakdown is as follows (according to their email): 
""You failed to professionally clean your carpets; the oven, stove, top of the refrigerator, cabinets/shelving were dirty,  and there were areas that were not touch up painted at move out.  Unfortunately, per your move out guidelines, every resident is required to leave the dwelling in good condition.
8/17/2014
Carpet Cleaning - 85.00
Apartment Cleaning - 80.00
Touch up painting - 60.00
+ Tax
229.50""
I requested pictures of their inspection several times via phone and email, but no one returned my calls or sent me the pictures confirming this. I finally spoke to the property manager Sarah, who explained that tenants are expected to prepare the units for the next tenants, including painting, professional carpet cleaning, and full cleaning detail. With this review, I would like to include the inspection pictures staff took in order to show that the unit was in better than good condition upon move out, but Sarah has yet to send them, even after repeated requests. My sister and I lived in this unit for two years and maintained it very well. We spent several days cleaning the unit, using Magic Erasers on nearly all surfaces prior to vacating. 
As tenants, we had no disciplinary issues, no complaints, never paid rent late, and were always patient with staff when packages were lost, fixtures and appliances broke several times, and even when my small dog was attacked by a resident's pit bull (which is banned from this complex) and no action was taken for well over a month.
If you are planning on signing a lease here, please think twice about it. You will be hit with additional fees upon move out, poor treatment and customer service from staff, and total lack of respect and communication regarding the fees.

The only intangible problem (if you didn't notice the constant head turning and the increasingly impatient waving of nearby guests) was in the service. It took an extremely long time for our orders to be taken while we hungrily watched surrounding tables get served. The lone server frantically trying to keep up with all of the orders would repeatedly ask the same questions and was running around so hectically, that I felt bad when I needed to ask for ketchup.

The food was quite good. I chose one of the handful of omelets-de-jour that featured cremini mushrooms and polished off every last morsel on my plate including the incredibly ungreasy home fries and tantalizing side of greens. The extra page of brunch specials really added a lot of tempting options to the mix. There surely would be no shortage of dishes to come back to try next time.

I've always been on the hunt for really really really great Korean fried chicken, and I think I found it!! Not wanting to travel anywhere without parking, I went to Home of Hot Taste which had very accommodating parking spots!

It's loud in there, but not Guu loud, it looks just like any other Korean eatery.

I was unsure what to expect but I knew that Korean fried chicken comes with pieces of the chicken. Not how we're used to at KFC with a drumstick, thigh etc But EVERY single part of the chicken! I think that's the fun of it, you don't know what piece you'll get!

The fiance and I got a half and half order of original and mild spicy. And holy jesus ... Our faces lit up! Amazing batter, well seasoned and the mild spicy sauce was extremely delicious! A little on the sweet side to be honest, but great nonetheless!! 

We also got the oyster kimchi fried rice on the side, which my fiance claimed it's the best kimchi fried rice he's ever had. I beg to differ. It's not my number one pick for kimchi fried rice, but it's pretty damn close! 

It's reasonably priced, so I have no complaints. The portions are a bit bigger than you expect!

I could tell that the staff seemed a little overwhelmed, which lead to them being less friendly than they could have been but again, this all comes with the territory of being a brand new restaurant. 

The shredded chicken is the best thing you can eat here- in a burrito, in a taco, on nachos- whatever floats your boat.  Their guac is also to die for- it is so creamy and is just perfection. My husband is obsessed with their nachos.  They are GIGANTIC and could probably feed a family of four easily (of course he finishes them off solo). I forsee a TON of visits in our future now that they are so close to home!!!

On a mom note, they have high chairs available and a kids menu that has a fair amount of options compared to other places.

We were seated right away for an early lunch.  The first thing I noticed was that the TVs were playing reruns of South Park.  Now, I'm no prude, but there were lots of children around and the sound was on.  I don't know that I would take too kindly to someone playing that kind of show during a lunch with my children.  No one complained, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  A small thing, but a little disturbing and not typical of what I've seen at Bahama Breeze.

Our server came and took our order, which consisted of ham and cheese croquettes for an appetizer, soup and salad for me, and the chef's special for my fiancé.  Our food came out quickly, but sans appetizer.  I asked the person who brought our food where the appetizers were and she went to investigate.  I had to endure listening to loud arguments in the kitchen until, finally, they figured out that the waitress never rang up our appetizer.  Never mind that the operating system computer was literally two feet from our table... somehow she forgot.  No biggie... it happens... except that she was NOT apologetic at all.  She came over and said, and I quote, ""I forgot to put in your appetizer order.  So do you still want them or not?""  She said it like it was MY fault that it happened.  I didn't wanna pay for an appetizer to be eaten AFTER my meal.  Kinda defeats the purpose, ya know?  t declined and settled upon eating my soup and salad.

I have had the chicken tortilla soup before and usually LOVE it.  However, this time it was barely lukewarm.  Furthermore, the vegetables were so crunchy that I felt like a cow chewing cud with each bite.  I get that some soups have firmer vegetables, but this was a whole different type of crunchy.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found (presumably hiding from us after the appetizer incident), so we asked another server to send it back.  The server informed our waitress about what happened, and they proceeded to LOUDLY discuss how I was just trying to be fussy and that the soup WASN'T cold enough to send back RIGHT BY OUR TABLE.  I'm the customer.  Isn't that up to my discretion?  The soup was room temperature.  To me, that's cold.  And I have to pay, so I expect hot soup.  Period.  I couldn't believe that it was up for discussion, especially within my earshot.

The manager came over and brought us a free order of croquettes and fruit salad and asked us about the incident.  When I explained about the soup, the manager proceeded to defend the temperature of the soup, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and the behavior of the waitress.  Really??!?!  Oh, so you gave us all this free food to make up for something that apparently wasn't done incorrectly?  The attitude was basically that they were gonna try to satisfy me, but that they really shouldn't because I'm the picky bitch who sent back soup I should have choked down.  Unacceptable service.  

We paid our bill and left no tip - when I hear a waitress gripe about me to her coworkers, she doesn't deserve a tip.  Yet, it was interesting to watch her rush to our table the second we signed the receipt and stood up.  Heh.  Dream on, crazy waitress.

Steer clear of this place - the service is sub-par.  There are much better places to dine in this city.",2012-05-14 22:05:38

Had been by it quite a few times, but always forgot to drop by for lunch when I was actually around there. Like a little Italian bistro in a corner space, this Chinese run restaurant was quite authentic to European cuisine, without making dishes fusion, or Hong Kong style. Definitely won points there!

The space is quite small, with only about 5-6 tables, but the decor was very modern and similar to a cafe in Europe. With an open kitchen and wine for days, this is definitely a nice change of scenery compared to the other restaurants in the plaza. With jazz playing in the background, it creates a comfortable environment and vibe to sit and eat your lunch, and slow down your hectic day. 

With a simple lunch menu, with about 5 pastas and a couple of mains, it is definitely a nice array of choices without being overwhelming. We went for the Italian Sausage Pasta and tthe Beef Stew. Both were quite delicious, with good flavours coming through. Portions were rather small, but I assume that was because it was from the lunch menu. 

Service was quite good, as the restaurant is quite small. With 1-2 servers and 1 chef, everything is done small-scale, but works for them. 

They definitely had some dishes and desserts I may wanna try another time, so I guess I would come back some time! Give it a try!",2015-06-17 20:50:32

The setup is kinda weird but it's definitely better then how the previous business was setup. The line moved pretty quickly and they have seats for those that are here to take out. 

We ordered 18 wings and decided to spilt up the flavors. We got 6 garlic prepper, 6 medium, and 6 lemon pepper. The cashier was friendly and our total came out to be close to $25 including a drink. A drink is $2.59 and each wing will cost you close to $1.

Finding a table was a challenge. There are two sections where you can sit at. Most of the tables were a bit dirty and the trash cans were pretty full. No I wouldn't have minded if the trash cans maybe had a lid on them? Some tables are right by the trash cans and the trash is out in the open. Yuck 

The cashier brought our food out about 15 minutes after ordering, and the wings were sooo HOT. They were crispy, juicy, and were a pretty good size. Our favorite was definitely the garlic pepper! They were so good! 

Come here for great wings!! They have a ton of flavors and by the taste of it they must all taste great! 

3 stars just because cleanliness is not there. Other then the trash being so full and the tables being so sticky, there was random trash on the floor and it was so muggy inside.

Don't get me wrong - it could be better, but I don't think Vegas is really that into beer just yet, so the selection they have is sufficient.  The cashiers are always friendly and helpful, and if there is a particular item you are searching for, they will check the database to see if it is something they can get from their distributor.  Prices are reasonable.  They have a loyalty club as well.  I am not 100% sure what the benefits of this club are, but I am certain to give my key fob card everytime I go!  :)

Home/Farm
Culinary institution/school
Restaurant/Caterer

There was plenty of bread at the beginning to eat with the soups.  However, they ran out too early.  Unfortunately, by the time it was 2pm, many of the soups had run out too.  

The event was supposed to last until 4pm.  Festival goers still had tickets but didn't have the variety to choose from.  Good thing some vendors did make a lot of extra soup.

Woods makes the transition from chef to restauranteur seem effortless as he leaves no detail behind.  I'm sure having Anthony Davis (formerly of Sidecar) in the kitchen also puts his mind at ease.

WOODS is located in the former Colborne Lane space. High ceilings, exposed brick and large windows make the space inviting.  A white, rippled wall serves as the backdrop to the bar which leads into the dining room with tree-themed banquettes.  The focal point, an elaborate green, ""branch"" chandelier brings life and colour to the space as quiet lounge music plays in the background to allow for gentle conversation.

The menu exemplifies farm-to-table and is a ""greatest hits"" compilation from both Woods and Davis' prior stints.  Even the water is sourced locally from Caledon, Ontario.  Familiar items such as wild Digby scallops served with corned beef cheeks,  parsnip purée, maple-mustard vinaigrette + lemon balm showcase Davis' mastery in the kitchen.

The blank dishes serve as a canvas for the beautifully plated dishes such as the melt-in-your-mouth Québec Foie Gras with purple potato, bacon, + Saskatoon berry compote.

Those looking for a lighter option can seek comforts in the Yellowfin Tuna served atop a bed of crunchy wheat berry + green olive salad, sundried tomato + English pea purée.

Do save some room for dessert as the Raspberry ""Macaronnade"" is simply luscious.  A light and airy Mascarpone mousse is interlaced in raspberry and served with a side of refreshing basil ice cream.  Davis definitely has fun in the kitchen as he presents raspberries in various textures (gel + tuille).

The wine list is a refined selection of local and imported pours with amarones, barolos and chardonnays.  The beer list is comprised of Canadian microbrews.  While this is a tree-themed restaurant you'll be glad to know that nothing is forbidden, though I believe gluttony is mentioned in Dante's Inferno - at least I'll die happy!

We have a rabbit (who is a total prima donna) and we knew we couldn't bring this new hobo bunny into our home permanently -- it wasn't the right time and we were concerned about disease and bonding the pair successfully.

The bunny was a total lover, very sweet and used to being held. It was gut-wrenching for me to take her to a shelter, but I knew they could care for her and that were simply a short-term foster from owner to rescue.

The NV SPCA didn't hesitate --- they said ""bring her on in!"" and they had a bunny experienced person ready to take her for us. Despite the homeless guy saying she was fixed and potty trained, we discovered neither were the case. The SPCA scooped her right up and said she'd see a vet and be in good hands.

The facility was much nicer than I expected from the area/exterior, the staff was friendly and supportive, too.  I will totally go to them when we ARE looking to add another bunny to our family (or a dog!).

They were a little late in joining the DeSoto family, but finally came into the fold on May 9th, 2015.  Having sampled all of DeSoto's other creations, I figured I'd give this place a shot.  I should preface this review by saying that my rating is closer to a 3.5, but I'm rounding up largely because of Chef Pete.  Super classy guy who answered pretty much all of my questions and explained his rotating menu (though he didn't give up all his trade secrets).  The prices are such that I can't give this place a super high mark yet, but my first visit gives me plenty of reason to be hopeful of this new upstart.

Among the items on Walrus & The Pearl's food menu include different types of oysters, shrimps, as well as other fish species.  Among the menu items that caught my attention during my first visit here was their pokes.  I've heard of poke (pronounced po-kay for those unfamiliar), which I know is huge in Hawaii and parts of Asia, but I've never sampled it for myself.  Essentially pokes are small bowls of raw fish that are covered with sea salt and an array of various marinades.  Today I decided to have a Yellowfin Tuna Poke.

The menu doesn't mention what was in the poke other than the tuna, so I did my best to figure it out on my own.  Aside from sea salt, I picked up sriracha, lemon juice, pepper, parsley, and scallions.  Might've been a few other items in there, but that's what I could make out.  The portion was fairly modest (though plenty for lunch), but about what I expected based on seeing poke dishes on the Food Network.  Overall, I was a big fan of this dish.  The sriracha gave it a little bit of a kick without being too spicy and the tuna tasted good enough to be sushi grade (who knows, maybe it was).  I also got a glass of the Pinor Noir.  I was pretty happy as I was the first one to have their Pinot Noir so they opened the bottle in front of me.  Refreshing accompaniment to the poke for sure.

So back to the drawback of this place.  The prices.  Total tab for the poke, glass of Pinot Noir, tax and tip came to $35.  Granted, I ordered one of the more expensive wines on their list.  But still, $15 for a glass of wine is pretty steep.  Most of their drink offerings are around $10 or less so don't let my experience scare you off on that front.  The prices of the seafood items themselves pretty much vary on which type of seafood you get and how much of it.  And as I mentioned earlier, the food menu rotates depending on what they have available so bear that in mind.

Taken as a whole, Walrus & the Pearl has promise.  It remains to be seen whether this oyster bar/seafood restaurant concept can work when there are much cheaper offerings at DeSoto, but its certainly worth a try.  As mentioned Chef Pete is a super friendly guy and has been an apprentice of famed valley chef Stephen Jones (i.e. Blue Hound Kitchen, Yard Bird, etc.), so he's got the lineage to succeed.  Hopefully he's able to work out the menu to a price point that will make his oyster bar a regular mainstay for Downtown lunch and dinner crowds.  After all, taking risks are pretty much what every aspiring restauranteur at DeSoto is here to do.",2015-05-10 20:00:04

You know what? I'm glad I went. It was actually a pleasant experience and for the most part, the place has vastly improved from my last visit. 

First of all, they offer fit fare selections on the menu which is important to me. The portion of egg whites I had was way more than advertised, but that's ok because it was a vegetarian omelet that was filled with veggies that I don't ordinarily find in an omelet: squash, zucchini, and more! I asked if I could skip the toast and just have fruit and the server gave me a double portion of fruit! Nice! 

Dad had the french toast and he loved it. It's a generous portion of french toast and more than he could finish. 

And the server was really very nice. She smiled and kept smiling the whole time she served us! Yeah...I know, right? Crazy! She was pleasant, friendly, and prompt with service. Loved it.

The restaurant space is small but cozy, and is also pretty quiet on a noise level basis so you're not shouting across the table. Similar to Salt of the Earth, they have their menus up on chalkboards however the chalkboard size and the fonts are smaller so we had a hard time reading, especially since there was a glare from the light from where we were sitting (it didn't seem very appropriate for us to get up and take a closer look since that might mean us intruding on someone else's dinner). Good concept in theory. 

I ordered the meatloaf which was good and my boyfriend ordered their special fish and chips, and unfortunately everything came out tempura fried for him which was not what he was envisioning from the way it was described by the waiter. And then because we were there for a celebration, we ordered their smore dessert. When we got the smores, it was a deconstructed version which unfortunately was a miss for us on this too. There were pieces of chocolate and we were suppose to drink or dip them into a chocolate liquid. We were confused. Needless to say we did not finish it.

Ultimately the choices we picked at Avenue B were either not mind blowing or memorable for all the wrong reasons.

Oh wait, 5:32PM and Rachel arrived.  That's awesome!! super fast accurate delivery. They crushed everyone else by a long shot.

So for the important stuff.  How did it taste?. Well out of the gate there is really no way any fast food, mass produced company can really make the best pizza for the prices they sell at so that is just a given for me.  That said, while it is not Vinnies neighborhood pizza from Brooklyn, it is pretty great.  The Brooklyn style was a hand tossed much thinner and much more like a NY style pizza. Not a bready as the normal pizza so a plus in my eyes.  They also slice them in larger slices like un north so one big piece almost has you full.  The extra cheese side was better than the regular cheese and hamburger but overall it was much better than I ever remembered and I will use the online service again.  Their service really crushes everyone else and I've got to say that the quality of the food was every bit as good, if not better, than anything else we could have had.  Nice work Dominos. Nice work.",2015-01-12 02:21:54

I went there with my MealPal application subscription for lunch during day. Atmosphere is pleasant, style is right but I found the portions really small.. What surprised me was with Meal Pal we are supposed the get the same size portions but it wasn't so... especially the meat part, my beef shawarma was like half of what the regular customers got, so was very disappointed with the quantity... Taste was ok, although beef part looked kind of dry and there was just very little sauce.

The portions are weak for the price paid and the quality is pretty poor. Asking for them to run coupons or discounts is like pulling teeth when you have to wait an extra 15 minutes while your food gets cold sitting there while someone locates a manager. 

More distinctively remembered- the food was all carelessly thrown in cheap styrofoam containers that were melting from the heat of the hot food... the food that WAS hot until having to wait 15 minutes for a manager then the drive home. Applebees has legit quality plastic containers for to-go food. Why doesn't Chilis?? One thing I ordered was a side of grilled asparagus w/ Roma tomatoes & garlic. Sad presentation & portion for almost $10 of a charge! 4 weak, skinny, stringy strands of asparagus w/ 2 tiny bite-size cherry tomatoes and probably 10 pieces of garlic just thrown in a giant styrofoam container. I like garlic, but it was majority of garlic that I paid for. I could have gone & bought my own ingredients for half the cost of what this was. 

I can't say anything else I ordered was worth it, either. It is like they bank on no one checking to-go orders before they carelessly throw tiny portions in crappy boxes. For the price paid, it was a ripoff and not worth it when it came to the quality of the food, either. And when you are offering coupons/discounts through email, those should be honored with no question, not having to make customers wait 15+ minutes to find a manager to approve what your company is marketing to begin with. 

The least they did that was good was throw in an extra side of queso. Had it not been for that gesture, I probably would have left the food and asked for a refund. Please get your act together. I went to Applebees as an alternative and they blew Chilis out of the water with service, portions, quality & price.",2017-05-08 00:29:19

On Saturday night an entire section of the bar was reserved for a kids baseball team and their parents. Is this a sports bar or a Chucky cheese? Thought that was kinda lame. I only mention that because as we were sitting at the bar eating our $2 garlic parmesan fries (which had a nice amount of garlic on sturdy frozen steak fries) we noticed the big TV at the bar was very blurry. Yes, we were seeing double on that TV, so we had to move, but 1/2 the bar was off limits. Blurry TV..uhhh get it fixed. 
      The drink specials and beers here are always good, but food is still kinda shaky. As a sports bar, how can you not have mozzarella sticks or potato skins on the menu? My friend ordered the $7.95 BBQ chicken dinner, but this isn't BBQ, the breast is off the bone and then they simply cover the chicken with a bottled? BBQ sauce. So, it's technically  BBQ chicken, wink, wink, but real BBQ chicken is on the bone and actually gets sauced while cooking. My entree was way more successful as I had the Orchard salad with blackened chicken added for $2.95, which made this salad about $12. The chicken is this dish was outstanding, a great version of the blackened seasonings. My request for dressing on the side was ignored, so I just ate it anyway and the raspberry vinagarette, which the waitress said was homemade, wasn't too sweet afterall. Alot of tasty walnuts and dried cranberries appeared as well.

Ordered a white pizza with bunch of topings, wings and two cups of baked minestrone soup and one slice of pepperoni pizza.

Please do not bother with the pizza. It was probably the worst I've ever had. I'm from NY, this is not NY pizza. It was too salty, super soggy and too thick. 

Wings came cold

Mild sauce was absolutely nothing but vinegar. It was inedible. I think they make it in house so this must have been a bad batch. 

Single slice of pepperoni was pretty decent and crispy. 

Baked minestrone (with baked mozzarella cheese) was a bland soup with pieces of curdled cheese at the bottom of cup. Was not hot or warm. 

WORST customer service. Called to express disappointment with soup (anticipated that cheesy goodness) and the girl on the phone could not possibly have less ""I don't give a F"" in her tone.  ""Said OK thanks now we know. I don't know that cheese goes to the bottom of cup for deliver because"", and get this, ""no one has EVER ordered soup for delivery and we have no way of knowing"". I guess they do not bother to check the food before they send it out and it's impossible for them to lift a lid and make sure the food made matches menu description. 

Also please note that when you order ""kalamata olives"" you will get canned black olives. I don't think they know the difference between the two. 

I am across the street from them. We waited well over an hour for a delivery. Probably closer to an hour and a half--I will check the times. 

I am so angry that I spent $58 on this awful awful experience. I will definitely not EVER make that mistake again. What a waste of my money. I've also expressed my feelings to their corporate office and do you think anyone so much as sent me an automated ""thank you response""? No.",2014-03-08 02:10:53

There was a mound of fruit relish (I'm guessing currants, though our server never did confirm) and a splash of preserve (guessing strawberry, but it had no real purpose any way, except to decorate the plate). 

The toasted bread that accompanied the cheese plate was good and there were inexpensive options for bottles, which I had not anticipated. 

That said, the oysters really were only $1 each and though not a connoisseur, I thought they tasted fresh and delicious and that WAS confirmed by my happy hour companions who do consider themselves connoisseurs. 

So, my point: happy hour is good here. Go for the oysters. Skip the cheese plate. You can do better sampling at the deli counter at Fry's.",2009-11-23 05:08:29

This place is really nice and has a more upscale feel. We encountered the most helpful, knowledgeable and friendly staff. They really made us feel welcomed. It's fairly inexpensive. For $20 you get unlimited time for the entire day in the range and it also includes:

-Safety glasses and electronic ear protection. It filters out the live fires but you can still clearly hear voices next to you. So take advantage and use the ones they provide you.

-2 paper targets

-They clean your guns for you after you use them. (except ones with laser sights)

-Also complementary popcorn and soda in their lounge area  while you wait for your guns to be cleaned.

You can rent guns and buy ammo there. Both Mr B and I brought our own, so Im not too sure how much they charge. There's a Sig I want to practice with next time and I was told it was $10 to rent. 

The range itself is well ventilated so the smoke is cleared out faster. Lighting bright enough to see your targets. They are quick to clear out the brass casings off the floor. The range officer present was also helpful too. While my pistol was not in use, he noticed my laser sights were still on and pointed it out, save me on battery wear..thanks!

You can also fire shotguns ..just no steel core or steel shot (..saving those for zombies anyways right?) more on gun range specs ( http://greenvalleyrange.com/the-range/)

It's very family friendly. All different skill levels from newbies like me to more experienced shooters like Mr. B.

And like I said customer service here is exemplary. Not once did I felt intimidated (like at other ranges I've been to)  Im a newbie and everyone was so welcoming, helpful and patient especially the Asst.

I tend to order the drip coffee black, it's great.They seem to rotate the blend they use every couple months or so.

The selection of baked goods is huge as well. They serve goods from a variety of bakeries which is nice.

The atmosphere and service at Crema is great, as regular it's hard for me really say anything about it because it's what I've gotten so used to. When I go to other cafés it's natural for me to judge everything about that cafe as it compares to Crema.

So anyway, I continued my impromptu foie gras tour here (I previously had the billion dollar burger at Holsteins), after hearing about the special being served - buffalo steak with foie gras.  Now I've heard how lean buffalo meat is but have never tried it, so it sounded like the perfect time to try it out.  Looking through the appetizers, they had a fantastic assortment of appetizers and salads, including seafood appetizers.  But, of course, after I saw the foie gras appetizer I knew I had to order that dish, and I'm really glad I did. First, it's a huge cut of foie gras and comes in a cherry compote, then drizzled with fresh basil oil and topped with cilantro.  Finally, it's served with brioche crustinis which give it the perfect texture combination.  Amazing!!!

The buffalo did not disappoint either, it was extremely tender and not dry at all for being a such a lean piece of meat.  It tasted like a prime cut beef filet, if not more flavorful. Of course, it was complimented by another large piece of foie gras and topped with fried parsnips and truffled mashed potatoes.  The earthiness and different textures complimented each other magically and I ate everything which was a lot.

I'm a big fan of Middle Eastern food, and some of what Aladdin's offers delivers. The hummous is very good, and usually I like the falafel, sandwiches and salads. The menu here is varied and interesting, and I've had some good meals here. I ordered take out from this location yesterday and was disappointed. I picked up the veggie sampler for myself and the chicken mishwa salad for Doug. The salad had grit in the lettuce leaves, which is always an unpleasant experience. Even if this had been well prepared, it was a small serving for an entree sized salad. We get a similar salad at My Big Fat Greek Gyro, and it's twice the size, with a dozen olives in it, compared to the three in Aladdin's salad. It's like the old Woody Allen joke. Two women are dining at a restaurant and the first woman says, ""This food is terrible"", and the second woman says, ""Yes, and such small portions, too"". After a couple of bites of this, Doug ate the chicken and olives and gave up on the lettuce. The veggie sampler is too much food for me anyway, so I shared. We both found the falafel too salty, and the stuffed grape leaves were also overly salted and the rice in them a bit undercooked. The hummous was as good as ever, and I enjoyed the baba ganoush, although I like my own homemade version better. When I can make better food than a restaurant, why bother eating there? I guess the answer is convenience. I'm also not a big fan of their pita, which is very thin and dries out quickly.

It can be crowded at lunch so it helps to have a reservation however you can also get it to go so that can be another option.   In my experience at dinner it tends to be less busy and they have a second section of the restaurant that they open up as well so for that time you generally don't need to reserve.

I usually get the beef japchae which is a sweet potato noodle dish.  It's pretty good but I wish it would be more on the spicy side when I ask for it like that.  They also serve a kind of fish soup with it and a side dish which consists of a sampling of three different sides.  They tend to change up the sides from time to time but kimchi is usually one of the options.  I'm not a fan of the fish soup but the sides generally are pretty good.  

For the price you can't go wrong with Atti.  In general main dishes are $10 around lunch time so it's only a tad more expensive than the food court factoring in tip and tax however it's far better quality-wise.",2014-01-10 22:34:29

My mini me was excited and I gained a ton of daddy points for this one.  Actually my first concert where there was no lines for beer, I didn't experience any fights, and the men's rest rooms were empty.  Complete opposite at every NFL game, NBA game, and even other concerts. 

But this review is for the venue.  So, here we go.

-I thought the Grand Garden was a bit small.  I considered this a pro because nose bleed seats is still close.  I've been to nose bleed seats where you feel like you'll fall to your death walking to your seats or actually get a nose bleed.

-Entrance:  Staff and crowds well organized. 

-Exit:  Complete opposite then when you arrive.  If you watch the whole event, the crowds on the way out can be bombarding.  I felt like cattle at first.  No big....I played fullback for the night and bouldered my way through.  My daughter had it easy with my NFL style blocking. 

-Parking:  Use the structure and it's actually quick and easy in/out.  

-Valet:  Nope.  Wish they had it for us commoners.  

-Staff will help you to your seats if you are lost or can't read your ticket.  

TIP:  Since the venue is a bit small, this place can get really loud.  Imagine 10,000+ screaming teens.  If I ever go to another Justin Bieber concert again, I will bring a bag of ear plugs and sell them by the door.  I would have made a killing.",2012-10-02 06:30:12

We love the deli meats - so many flavours to choose from. Some personal favourites are the sun-dried tomato Turkey, Montreal smoked meat, Cajun chicken and the super meaty Beef frankfurters! We have tried almost everything in store and though the prices are on the steeper side, it truly is amazing quality. They even vacuum seal the packs so you can freeze with ease!
I also love the homemade burger patties (try the Soujouk beef burger for a spicy kick), the marinated short ribs (no words for this... just wow), the juicy lamb chops, the dry-aged beef steaks and the marinated beef stir-fry that is amazing for Philly cheese steak sandwiches! 

It definitely is the place for last minute barbeques or meals as their pre-marinated meats and chicken look and smell delicious. And best of all, it is Halal!

Maison Kam Fung was really busy when we got there, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The attractive aspect of this place is the traditional way in which the dim-sum is brought (or carted) out. There are not many places nowadays that use the carts because it just causes too much problems (i.e. bumping into people, etc).

I first recommend that you reserve a table. It can get quite busy so call ahead to reserve. So, the way this works is that you have a 2 hour time limit. At your table you have a steak knife and a fork. On the left side you have a pair of tongs. So where are the plates? Well, there is a salad and pasta buffet at the end of the restaurant. You get your plates from there. All of this may have seemed logical but the host who seated us mumbled the instructions. So, when you have your plate, these guys come around with meat on skewers. They use a knife to cut a sliver of meat. This is where your tongs come in... you use your tongs to grab the meat as the guy is slicing off a morsel. Obviously the meat came off in pieces and I had to keep grabbing the pieces as they were falling off. One piece was accidentally knocked into my friend's cup by the guy. Another server got upset at me cause I was not holding the meat properly as he was slicing off a piece. Actually, I could not tell if he was upset or just telling me how to grab the meat cause again the guy mumbled. What is it with this place? They all mumble. The meats were cooked nicely, but man they were all salty! All I tasted was salt. Note: if you have a high blood pressure problem avoid this place. If Brazilian cuisine is this salty I am surprised that they don't have a high blood pressure epidemic in that country! The best meat was the spicy chicken cause it was not as salty as the other meats. The pineapple was delicious. I recommend that one for sure. The meat came around frequently so you were not waiting too long in between your meats. As contrary to what I read before, they don't charge you a $1 for water. The buffet was average. The service was decent. Since it was summerlicious, it was $35 per person.

This is in regards to the Henderson location: BF and I decided to give this place another try since Lemongrass had been screwing up our orders the last couple times... boy did I regret giving this place another chance!

First off, the waitress couldn't speak an ounce of english nor understand it. I think it took about 5 mins going back and forth when I just wanted to order a rare steak and tendon (they didn't have it on the menu). My boyfriend finally says she wants a #whatever without the tripe... I wish he didn't even say that because.. there was tripe in my soup.  I didn't want to bother telling the waitress so I just grinned and beared it.

The summer rolls came out fast but they were so loosley rolled everything was falling out. They brought out the plate of bean sprouts and basil.. there was only one sprig of basil! HOW CHEAP!! No spinach like leaf that I liked the last time I came here. 

The pho came out and the noodles were soooo chewy and stuck together that I was getting frustrated when eating it! Worse pho noodles ever. The broth wasn't bad but nothing special about it either.

Service is awful. I was surprised they came around to fill my water. The workers talk so loud in the same area without any regard to the customers.

After two $18 martinis (yes... $18 friggin dollars, but you get the shaker which is good for two pours (the second being a bit more watered down)) the bar started to get friendlier.  We were surrounded by what looked like several baseball players' ex-wives.... 50-somethings with tons of right hand bling, and leathery skin, but done up well and with the correct level of inebriation, pretty doable :)
The ambiance is best in class, and the wait staff was attentive and friendly.  I'll never be a fan of the 1000 degree plate (cook the food in the kitchen, not in front of me or I'd be at Benihana) but the seafood looked stunning.  Great place for a business dinner as well.

We were greeted at the mall entrance and asked whether we preferred the bar or dinning room. The dinning room was fairly quiet for an area with lots of traffic going past, but it was a Monday. 

The service was attentive at first, but the drink hadn't been updated to reflect their lack of Molson M on tap. I was flexible with my drink choice, but I feel that that information should have been relayed to us beforehand. For dinner, we ordered the sausage ravioli and a cheeseburger. The waiter got my friend's cheeseburger order correct (minus this...add that...etc etc.) which is impressive, but the fries were ice cold and hard. I'm sure they were sitting for quite a while before being serve, a no no in my book. Fries are suppose to be the crispy goodness juxtaposition to a juicy burger. These fries were just sad and I didn't want to go back and steal some more (and usually I steal about half!). My ravioli weren't much better. The filling was dry, instead of being luxious and creamy. I've had better store bought ravioli. There were three sauces over the pasta, basil pesto, creamy garlic and a marinara sauce. The tomato sauce was bright and fresh, but it was overpowered by the pesto. It tasted to grassy and made the whole experience unenjoyable. 

I visited this location about a year ago and had a delicous braised lamb dish. This was no longer on the menu (I would have gotten that if it was).

Finally deciding on the taco combo with one carne asada and one barbacoa taco on corn tortillas.  Ordering a limeade to drink and a raspado to be made before I headed out (which the lady working the counter kindly did).  
Now this was some good carne asada and the barbacoa was meaty lean and well seasoned.  The 3 salsas were very tasty ( a red, verde/tomatillo, and a chunky roasted green chile type) The heat was perfect (too hot for some and too mild for others I am sure) but it complemented the meal perfectly.  The tacos were garnished with pico de gallo (chopped tomato, onion and cilantro) and shredded lettuce.  Topped fresh squeezed key lime and with a mix of the salsas, I eat each positioned over the rice so the juices from the meat and the salsa get soaked up by the rice.  
The beans were tasty I just wished there was more on the plate.

The names of some of their dishes are very straightforward, as in they're literally what they give you. I ordered this salmon box while my friend got the chicken teriyaki one. It came in a cute little bento box with six salmon maki (was supposed to have avocado, but I asked for that to be removed), six salmon sushi, and a few cuts of salmon sashimi. There was also a bowl of miso soup, green salad, and sliced orange provided. The salmon did not taste or smell fishy at all, which is an obvious good sign as it indicated how fresh the fish was. 

I didn't try my friend's food, but she got chicken teriyaki, rice, and sashimi in her box (+ miso soup, salad, and orange). She told me that the chicken teriyaki was larger and more flavourful than she expected, which is always a good thing to hear! 

Service was standard. Both our bills came up to a little under 20 dollars each. If you're a student on a budget (like I'm supposed to be...), then maybe you should save this place for a special day. Otherwise, Genji is great, and would be a very cute date idea!

I was with my dad, and my godson's parents. They nodded off a bit in this. My dad, on the other hand, really liked this. My attention wandered a bit. So I would say it's great entertainment for a slightly older audience but for a group of people in their twenties you should look elsewhere.

The over all experience for me was between 2.5 Stars to 3 Stars, so I averaged it out to 3 Stars! 

The menu is quite nice but there is not much for people with restriction on meat in any form (such as Vegetarian, Halal and Kosher). I could not find anything on the main course either vegetarian or seafood related, so my decision of not checking the menu in advance had caused a problem here and I was Hangry! so I asked the waitress and she stated that I can get an eggplant in any of the options on the Schnitzel. The price was the same as a regular meat schnitzel but instead of meat the was an eggplant deep fried. So I went with that option as there was non other to satisfy my hunger. 

The service was extremely slow as there was one waitress and a cook. The waitress was friendly and tried her best to cope up with a large crowed as us (which wasn't that large). The other thing which was not appealing, the food came in stages and some people were done eating when the last person got their food.

The restaurant is very clean and small. The place can fit about 25 people to the max and has parking. 

Whereas, the food is concerned; I ordered a Parma Schnitzel (subsituted meat with eggplant). The Parma schnitzel has zesty tomato sauce and cheese on it. On the side I went with Spaezle. You might ask what a Schnitzel and Spaezle is? well A schnitzel is a boneless meat thinned and deep fried and Spaezle is a German version of dried Mac and cheese.

Stronger than arugula.   I ordered some wagyu steak on the side and it came out pretty much raw-- rarer than rare.  And about 5 small squares or meat. I was never asked how I wanted it-- but none the less it was ok.  Not the best flavor.   It was not even hot.  They could have added some more pistachios and lettuce to the salad.

Six is not my kind of bar/lounge, but I didn't find it that bad!  Did I feel a little judged?  Of course.  But I guess i was still expecting a little more from this place.  If I wasn't with a bunch of people that I knew, I think I would have been a little bored.  

And yes, the best thing about this bar is the bathrooms.  I had to say it.  I loved that when somebody was done, there was somebody there to sanitize it.  I was a little freaked out though, because what is those doors didn't work ...it was in my head for the few minutes I was in there.

Maybe I went there on not a so bad night.  It wasn't packed (it was Valentines Day and all) and mostly everybody there was my age...(ahem....late 20's/early 30's)  I probably won't go there again, only if I had to.

They offer many different massages such as hot stone, lomi lomi, sports, deep tissue and therapeutic.  I opted for the swedish since I wasn't feeling too stressed.  Once you sign up for a treatment you are granted access to the sauna, steam room, plunge pools and lounge area.  The lounge area is stocked with fruit and many beverages to hydrate you.  

I decided to utilize the plunge pools and sauna before I went back for my massage.  Before I knew it the therapist called me back for my treatment.  She had strong hands and adjusted the pressure for my target areas.  It was an overall good massage and experience.

I was wrong on both levels.  This place is not only fantastic and magical but they're crazy fast to boot.  I've never been so happy to be wrong!  -:P

We walked in and most (if not all) of the tables were full.  It was quite bustling with the servers quickly moving about as well as hostesses seating people.  Placed our name on the list, was told it was about 10-15 minutes and sat outside.  I don't even think it was 5 minutes when we were called and sat.  Cool.

The menus are newspaper-style (cute!) and there was also a special laminated menu for, well, specials.  Derp.  Service was always efficient and super-polite by our awesome server (who wore a cute egg-themed shirt over her baby bump); we were never left without.  My fiancé ordered sides and she made it a combo so we'd save money; I opted for the spam and eggs and rice meal!  Om nom nom.  We also were super excited to be in a non-bar/casino-type place and still order mimosas.  Super delish.

Everything tasted great and came out so quickly, but did not feel rushed in the least.  If you eat eggs, please go here - they know eggs better than eggs know eggs.  Seriously.  I rarely ever get scrambled eggs because most restaurants make them weird - this place made them to fluffy, delectable perfection.  Spam slices were thick and the sticky rice was better than at most Asian restaurants!

And the banana nut muffin is indescribably delicious.  Just... put it in your mouth and enjoy.

Prices are reasonable for a breakfast place - if you don't order alcohol (oops) - and sure as heck beats IHOP/Denny's.

Must come back to try all the other things on the menu that sounded amazing, like the breakfast burrito and spaghetti chili!",2011-12-21 00:18:42

My wife and one friend had salads and thought they were great.  Other friend had meatloaf sandwich and thought it good. Service was adequate. They don't serve dessert!!

LSLfRZrG7jfGBIPMUq_25w,XjkgUNYAqnVcuFmU53xP2Q,zFR99jgMi-qzaJXIx8MXHA,5,2,0,1,"The concept is simple yet fun. You pick your own flavours both syrup or milk powder with flavour, sugar levels, toppings, milks, and your tea base. Pick hot or cold and then you pay they make and you enjoy. 

The fun is in the details. The fun little syringes labelled with flavour syrups, the almost like urine sample cups of soy or condensed milk, the Petri dishes of jellies and pearls. It all come together on a surgical tray and then even call you doctor as they call up your drink by whatever name you give. The servers are all dressed up as lab assistants and are all really helpful and cheery. 

The overall flavour is going to be your own creation for better or worse, so you can't blame them for it being too sweet, and they will warn you if you pick a syrup base that adding sugar isn't necessary. The same might now be said about the jellies or pearls (popping bobas) but if you've ever had froyo you're familiar with the sweet juices that fish out of these. 

The surprise for me are the flavours. They have ginger syrup which taste and has the kick of ginger. Rose, Guava, kiwi and winter melting which aren't always the standard flavours. Soy milk was also a pleasant surprise as most people know that most Asian BBT places don't have non dairy options for you. 

The overall price varies when depending how much you load up but for $7.05 I got two flavours syrups two toppings and a large size cup. Fair price by my regards. I would say the one drawback is that this place can make you easily lose track of how the cost adds up by the time you get to the cashier, but I mean if you have a pretty solid drink, isn't you're own creation pricelsss anyways. 

Hard to find fault with this place. I will say though the syringes and Petri dishes can get sticky if the person before you mishandled them or spilled.",2018-06-04 03:22:10

It goes without saying that that they have mastered the food portion of fast healthy casual. I typically order a Ty Cobb or an Edgar Allen Poe salad, and have heard their wraps are fantastic. The atmosphere inviting, modern, and chic. The location, despite being in Scottsdale, is remarkably easy to get to and doesn't involve the typical 20 minute drive looking for a spot that is rampant in this part of town. 

Two faults: they are understaffed. I got into a line of more than 25 people and it took a good 20 minutes to order. Only three people working that line (two salad makers and one cashier) is no where near enough. It's unfair to both staff and customers to have that going on, especially since people really like the food and want something quick. I will be ordering ahead and pick up next time. 

Second complain is a lack of public wifi at this location. I know it isn't something the public should be entitled to, but this place lends itself well to a working lunch and I wish I could work from one of their tables on a short lunch break.

We shared a bunch of dishes to try and get a good idea of their menu and had quite a few leftovers. 

The pork soup dumplings were very good.  They were delicious and just brothy enough to be savory, but not enough to be too hot to eat or to make a mess of my shirt. 

Next we tried the pork belly bun.  This was not to my liking.  My husband was a fan, but only towards the bottom of the bun where the sauce was.  Before that it was dry and pretty flavorless.

The dan dan noodles had much more sauce and liquid than I expected especially since it is listed under dry noodles.  It was alright, but not great. 

The pork belly over rice greatly eclipsed the noddles.  The rice was savory and delicious from the pork belly and the addition of the pickled mustard greens.  The pork belly was nicely stewed and a nice unctuous counterpart to the rice.

I will definitely return and order more soup dumplings!",2013-08-28 13:44:31

The location is generally easy to find with quite a few green p parking spots to choose from. We got to le dolci 30 minutes early as we didn't want to get stuck in the traffic as it was raining. Upon coming into le dolci we were greeted by Lindsey and she directed us to a local coffee shop just up the street (we asked if there was one nearby) which was perfect!! The class was nice and small with only 6 participants which made it very cozy and calm. Lindsey was a great instructor and went through one flower at a time allowing you to perfect your piping techniques and providing you with time to practice before moving on to the next flower. She also had some music playing from her phone and some delicious popcorn and macarons to snack on as we worked our buttercream magic. The class was three hours in duration and it flew by!! I was really happy by the end of the class with how my cupcakes turned out and with Lindsey's knowledge of teaching and buttercream. She really took the time to help you with any problems and explain what you were doing wrong if you were having problems. By the end of the class we each had 6 beautiful cupcakes with bouquets of flowers on them to take home. Lindsey was even so kind to wrap the box in plastic wrap so the box didn't get soggy and wet as we walked back to the car.

Le dolci is definitely a hidden gem with both great classes being taught and lots of sweet treats being sold. They have a huge variety of cakes, cupcakes, royal icing cookies and even cake toppers! If your ever in little Portugal it's worth stopping by to visit :)",2017-04-16 03:07:15

N1O0xDJ4fVdAZJQOi3KZWA,Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,KKOum3UPH7n8dQ7p8fDiPA,4,0,0,0,"This morning I made a reservation for two people through the DINR app. It was for 6:00 pm which is a bit early for dinner but my partner and I still managed to make it (albeit 30 minutes late). I called around 3:30 pm to let them know that we are pescatarians (since they do not have halal or kosher). This place does not have a menu, they have a $65 - 5 course meal, and a $75- 7 course meal. So if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, you should tell them in advance so they can plan accordingly. 
When we walked in, we were surprised at how small and empty the restaurant was. It has only one long table at the front that seats no more than 6 people and two bar height tables for two. The rest of the seats are at the bar. When we arrived, we were greeted by no less than 2 people and seated immediately by the kitchen. I'm really glad we sat there because it was almost as if we had a private Netflix show, like Chef's table, with a view of all the meals that were being prepared. 
We decided to take the $65 meal since the 7 course comes with an additional appetizer and dessert. They start you off with two tinyyyy pieces of bread. They are soaked in olive oil and topped with scallions. Petite but delicious. 
Next we had the first course- which was salmon from Maryland, with some cucumber, and avocado sauce. It was probably the plainest of all the courses but very light and not fishy at all, I would describe it as refreshing. 
The second course was a beet salad, it had a white beet sauce splattered onto a plate with red and yellow beets scattered throughout. It also had pickled onions, grapefruit and my favorite part- toasted almonds. This dish was delicious and fresh and composed in a breath-taking manner. It was dramatic and subtle in flavor at the same time. 
The third course was the first warm meal, a few really fresh shrimps and some roasted red peppers with a delicious cream sauce. It was less memorable than the beet salad but also so perfectly balanced in terms of salty/sweet/fresh/savory. 
The fourth course was an incredible sous vide cod with a delicate sear. It was served with a leak, lentils and a delicious green sauce. This was my favorite course of the evening and I believe we were the only guests served it (the other guests had some sort of ravioli). 
The final course was a delicious chocolate/ banana/ hazelnut dessert. Torn hazelnut cake, sprinkles of hazelnut and chocolate crumble, caramelized bananas, chocolate hazelnut ice cream. 
All of the food was absolutely delicious, although it is very small. You shouldn't expect to feel completely full but you will feel satisfied. Also the service is incredible here- our water glasses were never more than half way full and we were constantly checked on. Our server would explain each course and every ingredient, including where the ingredients are sourced from. The room was a bit chilly the entire evening and the bathroom is tiny (but with an awesome Japanese style bidet toilet). However for a $150 price tag (after tax, before tip) I feel like I had an amazing time and would recommend it to anyone looking to have a real food experience instead of simply an amazing meal.",2018-01-21 04:15:39

The jumping off from high places was/is the intense scary moment for me.  

Deployment (OEFOIF 2003) was the ultimate.  I just wanted peace and serenity but Danna in the other hand enticed me to many adventures from exotic food to bungee jumping,quad, commitment , and skydiving.

Yes, you sign a release form saying you will not sue the company before and after death, weigh in, watch many films from the inventor/founder of the tandem jump (dude had a ZZ top beard), practice the banana lotus position, landing slightly bend knee position, and keep your hands & arms away from instructor mandatory position, breathing is VERY important, etc.....

Jumping off that plane was freaken orgasmic (in a non sexual way, I think?)!!!  Once feeling speed like portrayed in Fast in Furious with Michelle Rodriquez beside, on top, underneath, or just standing there smiling at ""you"", I did remembered to breathe and found myself  laughing and playing with the air distorting my skin/face cartoon-like. 

Kevin, a Veteran-ARMY- Navy, hulk holgan body asked me if I wanted to control the parachute.  I said, ""YES, (please)""!!  I followed his every instruction willingly.  To the left, to the right,  that parachute was heavy and it was all mine for 2 minutes.  

Sometime before this, Kevin pointed to LakeMead and said, ""there's my office!""  Clever and sooooo true.  I was so jealous of his job.  I've always wondeed why my Dad loved being an 82nd Airborne Ranger, now I get it (just an ounce).

My second favorite moment was when Kevin maneuvered the parachute to feel like we were standing frozen in the middle of the blue sky.  I felt like Super Girl taking a quick break from a jog/speedy flight.

The landing was soooo smooth for me I didn't even feel the ground.  I thought I was still in the air.  

We bought the video package and both laughed so hard tears soaked our shirts. Thanks to Groupon, Kevin, nice weather, and GOD!!!!",2011-04-06 05:27:09

The feta cheese and pita bread that come with the salad both taste like they are made there from scratch - if they aren't you can't tell the difference.

Although it usually opens at 7am, when we came on a Sunday morning at 9am, we were surprised to find entire mall empty and the restaurant only had around 2 other tables there - quite a surprise! Even when we left close to 11am, there were fewer than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and the mall was still pretty much empty. When seated, we were given 3 things - an order sheet with the names of the dimsum items in Chinese, not in numerical order, a book-type menu with photos and English, French and Chinese names of the dimsum items, and receipt sort-of sheet for marking off how many dimsum items arrived. 

The food quality was generally poor - many little lumps of fat in their food and very salty food in general. The main saving grace, was that their food was all very hot and freshly made. The biggest annoyance I found was that there was no indication of any dimsum prices. The menu book didn't list the prices, so you had no idea which dimsum item was $4, $4.5, $5, $5.5, $6 and it was dependent on the server to be correct with their dimsum marking.

Also note, if you pay in cash, you get a 15% discount and there's no tea charge like some dimsum establishments in Toronto.",2016-05-02 01:09:37

I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble. 

I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of ""Personal Favorite - thus far"" on it. 

I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother ""Gyros"" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.

Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)

We ordered the chef special which is the beef noodle soup.

The beef is obviously cooked in a slow fire and the cut is lean but flavorful  (not  fatty nor full of ligaments compared to other places I've tried before). I wish they have sriracha on the table to adjust the spiciness. My husband and I shared the big bowl and were really full and satisfied :) We also tried the fish fillet in bean paste as recommended by our very energetic server. It is sea bass filet, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The bean paste & chili sauce compliment the mild flavor of the fish. And boy, their serving is huge. We got 2 filets that could feed a family of 6!!! I also like that you have a choice of brown or white rice (I chose the brown rice and it has such a delicious chewy nutty flavor!)

This time I went during happy hour, and from 5-7 every day bar appetizers are all half off! Because I wanted to save my appetite, I only ordered the clam chowder soup, which was rich and delicious, with plenty of clams.  Then came the kobe steak, which though wasn't a true Kobe from Japan, which would have been impossible for a variety of reasons, much less the $72 price tag, but the steak was raised under similar conditions apparently.  The beef was heavenly and there was a definite difference in taste and silky texture.  It was really tender, similar to biting into a thick piece of fat, but with the taste and feel of beef.  Totally unreal.  

The only complaint I have is the accoutrements, which included supposed black truffle slices.  True black truffle has an instantaneous distinction, a strong earthy aroma and taste which enhances and pretty much overwhelms everything. These waxy plastic chips had nothing- no smell, no taste, nothing.  It tasted like stale beets, with no taste to them.  I had to ask the waitress what they were because I had to make sure, and she verified they were supposed to be black truffles.  I remember seeing a 60 Minutes report on the truffle market in France, about cheap truffles made in China that was flooding the market and bared little resemblance to truffles.  Well, apparently they've found their way to Las Vegas unfortunately.  But it's easy to tell, real truffles would have brought the price of the meal up $400-500, so it's easy to overlook.  I'd prefer that they not put it in myself, to just add a drop of truffle oil or two if necessary.

At any rate, excellent 5 star meal overall, with their ""Doughnuts and Coffee"" for dessert.  The coffee part was an espresso chocolate syrup to dunk the doughnuts in, which were actually more like doughnut holes.  Unfortunately the doughnut pieces were too big to fit in the syrup cup, so you had to squish them to fit and with the whipped cream it was difficult, so they have a little to work out on that part.

We threw in the onions, carrots and the stems of the suey choy first to get it going as it takes longer to cook.  Once the soup boils, the beef goes in and it takes seconds to cook the beef.  Don't overcook it or it will taste like tough leather!  Dunk your beef etc into the peanut sauce they give you.  It's so good!

I had the grilled meatloaf with veggies and horseradish potatoes and the hubby had the fried chicken cutlet with veggies and collard greens.  Both meals were good but I think I got the better end of the deal.  The meatloaf is good, but the red sauce they top it off with is the real kicker.

Thus, while fully functional, I now have a black iPhone 5 with a white ""home button"".  Maybe they could have ordered a white screen face?  Maybe it would have taken longer too.

It was worth the risk because the happy hour menu had several items that I could not decide between. My friend went with the sliders which was 2 mini burgers for $7. They came with a BBQ ketchup that my picky friend actually liked! I thought that the size of them should have been $5 or $6 since there wasn't any fries or chips with it. Especially since my fish tacos (also 2, but much bigger) was $7. They were yummy! I also ordered the duo of dips which were guac and pimento and cheese with tortilla chips. I have only ever eaten pimento and cheese with saltines or bread so the tortilla chips was a first for me. It was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't order it again for $7 either. HOWEVER, they have awesome warm bread that is complimentary with a spiced butter! I ended up eating most of the pimento and cheese with the bread because it was so darn good. Service wise, nothing special. Our server was nice, but both of our drinks were empty a couple times and the manager? came by a couple times and ended up bringing us what we needed. I ended my meal with the pineapple creme brûlée which was gorgeous and tasty, but too sweet for me. I would recommend it to anyone who likes very sweet and fruity things, but I am not a huge fan of desserts so I'm biased. Ultimately, would definitely come back for happy hour and the bread alone.

We started with a prosecco per usual. The nodini arrived - heaven sent little knots of delicious bread swimming happily in olive oil, salt and herbs.

Then to our mains, for her and her vegan tastes a simple pasta with marinara sauce, for me the not on the menu but often present carbonara. OMG, the carbonara here defines this classic. 

The wine was a response from our server to our quest for a great French Chardonnay experience a la Italia - a Claudio Cipressi Le Scoste 2013. It was fabulous.

We, who never eat desert, were enticed into sharing a board dressed with three small balls of delight, a lemon sorbet simple and tangy, a raspberry sorbet that filled the senses, and the creamiest ice cream I have ever experienced with an unexpected drip or two of balsamic vinegar on top.

Speaking of full price, their prices are pretty hefty for a fast food joint; I spent about $17 on a chicken salad and a massive shrimp burrito. 

Each of the items were large and filling. My sweetie pop and I shared them both and still had leftovers. The shrimp was cooked fresh, but the chicken tasted a bit old and dried out.

I don't get what all the fuss is about. 
The food is mediocre. It's not memorable and definitely not ""by far the best meal ever"". 
It's close to authentic, but it's a complete rip off of the Jose Garces style. Maybe it works in Toronto where there aren't many good spanish restaurants yet, but try placing this restaurant in any other major city and it would be a complete flop.

I'm pretty sure that's it's merely Charles Kabouth's popularity that draws in the large crowd and hype around this restaurant. I will say though that two dishes stood out to me, the chocolate pudding and the tomato bread. The simplicity of the dishes is what made them stand out. All the rest were just ok. 

The area this restaurant falls extremely short is service. The hostesses are cold, the servers are out to lunch and forgetful. It's not attentive service at all and they are completely missing the little details. I'm not sure why their staff haven't been trained well in a city where service is generally very good (relative to other cities).",2013-04-10 02:56:29

The sauce was supposed to be alfredo; a good alfredo sauce should have your heart slowing down and wondering if you're next move should be to the ER, but the sauce was pretty runny and the lack of cream might have actually made it not unhealthy.  

We went to the cafe another night, and the steak was pretty comparable to the Longhorn across the street which has 4.99 steak dinner, the one here cost 15.99 (OK, it did come with several fried shrimp).  The fixings were standard, broccoli and carrots with mashed potatoes.  Dessert was also uninspiring, caramel (again runny) apples with whip cream.

We noshed on the bread basket filled with a variety of sour dough, pretzel and raisin walnut.

First Course
Tomato Gazpacho; Summer Flavors, Marcona Almonds & Olive Oil and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp; Passion Mustard & Cumin Scented Honey

Second Course
Filet Medallions; Sweet Corn, Crispy Spaetzle & Fiore Sardo Cheese

Third Course
Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake; Vanilla Ice Cream and Summer Berries; Strawberry Gelée & Marsala Cream

The gazpacho must have been a blend of tomatoes and watermelon. It would make the perfect smoothie. Still, it was a refreshing treat with fun surprises of raspberries, strawberries, peppers, and marcona almonds. The shrimp were properly cooked and the bacon was nice and crisp. The flavor was a unique blend of sweet and smokey.

The filet was cooked to perfect and it sliced like butter. It was fantastic on its own, but coupled with the shallot sauce? Wow. We agreed the Bearnaise and au pouvoir hindered the already fabulous flavor of the steak. The spaetzle was light and tasty with the sweetness from the corn.

Dessert were tasty, but they were the weakest links of the meal. Properly executed but both just lacked pizazz. Service was attentive throughout the meal.

What good is the rating?  I am posting here again to see if it sticks this time.  If not, I will write again and keep it simple like these people are horrible.

I visited this dealer two years ago to buy an Elantra for my daughter.  You might ask why I am writing a review now?  Well they won't take me off of their call list despite me telling them numerous times it was a horrible experience and I wouldn't buy a car from them if they were the last dealer on earth.  My daughter and I went to Chapman Hyundai because they are roughly two miles from my home in Moon Valley.  It started out well enough with a test ride and review of the car.  We were looking to trade in a Cadillac SRX that certainly had issues.  I did not have high expectations for the trade but expected to be treated reasonably.  The salesman had no authority to do anything and kept running back and forth to the sales manager.  It took many trips because where they started was absurd.  Do they really think buyers don't have access to pricing information and trade in values?  I am a senior finance professional which they knew but they just kept grinding.  They showed absolutely no interest in making a reasonable deal.  Then they started being insulting.  That was it for us and we left.  This was the same car experience I had 20 years ago and one might expect the same today except I have purchased 15 cars since then and the experience has progressed so far at every dealer I have worked for.  The next morning, I sent email inquiries to the other 5 Hyundai dealers in Phoenix at 6 am.  Before 7 am, I had responses back from every one of them and every response was a far better deal than Chapman offered on the best of many attempts.  We ultimately settled on Nick Mayer Hyundai as they gave us the best price on the car and a great trade in on the SRX without even seeing it.  The salesman told us he would have to trade another dealership for the car so I had my doubts.  He called about noon and said he had the car and was going to get it cleaned and the windows tinted (something we had not included in the price).  I asked when we should come down to finalize the deal.  He said, Oh No!!, he would bring the car to us and be at our house at 5 pm.  Again, I had my doubts but thought I would let it play out.  He pulled into our drive way in exactly the same car we had tried to buy at Chapman the night before (i.e. same model, trim and options) with tinted windows we were not charged for.  I still had my doubts on how this was going to play out.  The salesman sat down and said he had brought two contracts - Here we go I thought but I was wrong.  The first contract was exactly the deal we laid out.  The second contract included an additional warranty to make the already good warranty bumper to bumper for 100,000 miles.  The cost?  Half of what Chapman wanted and if I added it, the rate on my loan was reduced by .50%.  All in, it ended up costing me a couple of hundred dollars to make sure my daughter's car was covered bumper to bumper for 100,000 miles.  We signed the docs and the salesman then spent over an hour walking my daughter around the car and explaining everything to her.  All in all, Nick Mayer Hyundai provided the absolutely BEST car buying experience I have ever had.  Way beyond any expectation I had.  This was less than 24 hours after Chapman Hyundai gave me the WORST buying experience I have ever had.  Well Chapman, you have continued to call me for the last two years and despite my objections and the fact that I told you I had a horrible experience you continue to call.  From this point forward, I will post this review on every site I can every time you call me.

Dad and I went down for lunch, and we had a Groupon that was good for $30. We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.

We sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.

I ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food. 

The food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.

My food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.

Throughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!

After all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!",2011-02-28 08:56:16

Those running the trucks were all kind and friendly! The idea is fun! But this did not work.  It was over crowded, wrong area and wrong layout.  I would imagine a grassy area that the trucks could line up into a single line would work better, so the lines could stay more organized.  Grass for blankets and picnics. Limiting ticket sales should be considered, there was just too many people.  It felt stressful and dirty, we were trying to eat while standing in the next line.  The porta potties were too close to the trucks, they stank, and they were dark.  The water ran out from the hand washing station, thank goodness I stay stocked on disinfecting hand wet wipes. To top it off, the door failed and who knows how many people caught a peak at me hovering when someone opened the door to the one I was in. Yeah, I have a new embarrassing story to try and forget now...  But today, I can't forget because someones food isn't agreeing with us, and we have to stay close to our own clean, well lit bathrooms.   

I had the goal to at least try to get a $65 meal worth of food for us, because that is what the tickets cost, but it didn't happen.  We ended up at Jersey Mikes after wards, just to get some food on our bellies.   

The good part, the ice cream from utterly delicious was soooooooooo good.  The sweet Caroline from epic hot dogs was very good. The hush puppy from the New Orleans style truck was very good.  The BBQ and coleslaw from the Piggy truck was very good.  The pork nachos were good, the cheese was sooooo good (this was the pink truck with a pretty blond on the front).  The creme brulee was yummy, no fancy steakhouse version, but still enjoyable.

The hummus appetizer alone, a generous serving at less than 3 bucks with hot pita halves, could be a heavy snack or a light meal. The very inexpensive sandwiches vary in quality: I found the falafel to be really good, the koubideh was OK, and the beef shawarma was dry and lacking in flavor. The tabouleh was a bit too acidic for my taste and would probably have been better if more bulgur were added.  Waiting time at dinner depends on the size of your group.

We bought four and headed out for some fun. It had been almost 15 years since my last visit on a Texas high school band trip. No more hot sand to walk on!!!

It's always nice when your kids are excited about a family adventure, but today I thought our son was going to literally cry for joy & excitement!  He loves the ocean & roller coasters.  What better combination then Big Surf's wave pool & numerous water slides!  

We did the economic thing, and ate before we left for the park. We knew there would be looks of junk food available and you aren't allowed to bring in any outside food, only factory sealed water is allowed. They checked our bags, although not as thorough as the TSA and no pat-down either. We did take about eight bottles of water, about two shy of what we could have used. 

We lucked out and had an overcast day. Overcast day in Phoenix, how does that happen?  We not only ate before we left, but we put our first of multiple coats of sunscreen on as well. It's really easy to forget sunscreen when the sun is hidden by clouds, but you can still get burnt even if you can't see the sun. Always wear sunscreen when you have an outdoor activity!!

We easily used our Groupons and entered the park. A lot had changed in 15 years!  IMO (in my opinion) the best upgrade are the palapas and removal of all the sand. The grass and water paths feel much better on your feet than red hot sand any day. 

We rode the slides until we couldn't see straight and then headed for the wave pool. They rent rafts for $5 plus tax. It sure would make it easier if they figured the price with tax included. You get a dollar back when you return the raft, bet you don't get the tax back from the difference on $4 instead of $5. I'm sure that adds up over hundreds of rentals per day! They also rent boogie boards and surf boards for the wave pool. 

The inability to bring in your own food also gives them the monopoly on food pricing. Some of the items were decently priced and others a bit out of hand for a family of four or more.  We had two personal pizzas, 3 tacos & a serving of watermelon for just under $20.  I can't imagine the cost of eating if both our children were Tweens or older, we'll enjoy it while we can. 

Overall we had a good time. The staff was all very friendly and respectful. The grounds could have used a bit more cleaning and maybe sweep the standing water off the low areas, they made for an eye-sore and we avoided them as much as possible. They were extremely dirty and steaming hot too. There could have been more lounge chairs available as well. All of this was tolerable, but not having enough tubes for the slides is inexcusable!  The park wasn't swamped by any means and there still wasn't enough tubes to accommodate the slide participants. If you were lucky the person getting off the slide would do the right thing and give it to the next person waiting in line for a tube. If you weren't so lucky you got side-swiped with that tube you were waiting for as the current holder zoomed past you for another turn. 

If you can get a good deal and have enough sunscreen, we highly recommend visiting Big Surf Waterpark. They do offer summer passes as well.",2012-07-13 01:35:07

First off, both the garlic sauce and ranch dressing were not good. However, I did really enjoy the sauce on the pizza. The crust was just ok to me. And all around it was pretty decent just not something I would need to go back for any time soon. 

The kicker to me is I ordered two slices to go and the to go was just on paper plates and in paper bags. I understand that I didn't pay for a whole pie buy considering I paid $10 and that's the price of normal small pies, I think they could have some cheap boxes.

I didn't want to have that feel of going to a bar with your kids. However, once we were inside, we saw other families there with their own kids and high chairs, it calmed my nerves. 

We were seated in a booth and they had a booster seat for my daughter. It was a nice way to make me feel included since most restaurants that have the name Tavern, isn't exactly kid friendly. 

To start, we got the beef short ribs poutine and where else can you get good poutine besides Canada? Come on, so of course we had to get it. It was one of the best poutines I've had and I've been to Canada many times. My husband got a cocktail to wash it down with.

For dessert, they have chocolate mousse and lemon cheesecake. We wanted to have dessert and was going to order one but my daughter said ""mommy, I'm tired, let's just go home"" so that's what we did. She must be very tired to skip dessert so I took that seriously.

I ordered a curry donkatsu, not expecting much based on the pictures in the menu. But as dishes arrived, the portion sizes were pretty big. At last, my dish arrived and I was surprised to see two pieces of katsu, dwarfing a small mound of rice in the corner.

The tonkatsu had crispy batter and the meat was alright. Not too dry, but not too juicy or tender either. I'm not sure how I would compare it to the last one I had at Katsuya, but it wasn't too bad or anything AND THERE WERE TWO PIECES for like $12 (which is about the same as Katsuya). Though, looking at a couple pictures, some people were only offered one piece? Not sure why the inconsistency.

The curry sauce is served in a separate bowl, which I liked as I could choose how I wished to use the sauce. It tasted alright.

When paying, there was the option of selecting your own tip, in contrast to another review that mentioned there was no such option. They may have added that at some point.

The reason for this is her lack of understanding of hormone balancing.  She never tested for progesterone levels, she only prescribed it as a sleep aid.  Most doctors follow the protocol of not prescribing progesterone if you've had a hysterectomy.  So she's no different from other incompetent, mis informed MD's out there.  However, since she was my Dr. and I relied on her to treat me, I want to warn others of her lack of knowledge.  I have since learned that even without a uterus, progesterone is important because it protects you from breast cancer.  It should have been tested along with estradiol and given the proper ratio in her prescription. But instead she prescribed more estrogen when I complained that I was getting hot again, BIG mistake now that my cancer is ER+.  The correct thing to do would have been to check for progesterone(which was practically non-existant) and balanced me out. I went to another Dr and he saw my high levels of estrogen levels and was alarmed. Rightly so, because I now have cancer.

Avoid her!

Bedroom is good, comfy bed, floor to ceiling windows with beautiful views, the bathroom is huge, with oversized jet jacuzzi and nice shower. It's supposed to be a great experience with a bathroom like that, they have TV in there too. 

BUT.... Beware of the glass door in the restroom! The bottom of the glass is really sharp, hurt my food pretty bad! I cut two of my toes, and I was bleeding so bad! 

Had to call security to take a look at it, they were pretty nice though, asked if I wanted to go to the emergency room, brought me band aids, first male security called in a female one to help me take care of my wound, filed a report, gave us a number to call if it gets infected later. And they put me on a wheelchair to get me out of hotel to my car, we were about to check out when I hurt my foot, they told us not to worry about check out time, just rest long and comfortable enough to leave.

The restaurant is located in the heart of uptown Charlotte, so good luck finding reliable street parking -- you might have to save about $10 for parking in the (almost full) lots on some adjacent streets, especially during the lunch rush.

I stood awkwardly outside the restaurant for 15 minutes waiting for my friends to park, and noticed that Vapiano was the ONLY establishment on the entire block to have any foot traffic at all.  Everybody who passed by me either came from the restaurant or were going into it.  It was hyping me up for some delicious, hot Italian food.  And believe me, I was ready.

I didn't realize how big the restaurant was until I walked in.  It's like a classy cafeteria, and you have a ton of chefs in one line ready to make whatever kind of pasta/pizza/other Italian food you want.  You wait for your food up front, put it on a tray, and seat yourself.  Regular water and citrus-infused water is at a station at the bar.

To be honest, I'm not really too big on the Italian food.  But the food was pretty good and flavorful and came out decently quick.  I even wish I had more of it for the price I paid, but it's not unreasonable by any means.  I would definitely go back if I was in the area more often.",2016-12-29 20:31:48

My buddy got the miso ramen and an avocado smoothie & I got the tonkatsu ramen and teri-sliders.
Both of the soups lacked flavor from their broth and was waaaay oily! The pork meat they put in there was pretty much all fat, edible but gross. The avocado smoothie was good but the boba was the kind that fell apart in your mouth. The best thing I had was the teri-sliders. You get 4 to an order which comes with LTO & a yummy teriyaki sauce.  Service was good but for the price range and quality of food they offer I'm not impressed.

I was in the mood for banana cream pie, they were out so we settled on a chocolate cream pie. A slice of pie is $4.50 so we decided on a whole pie for $15.00 which is 7 large slices. I like that they pre-slice the pie, very convenient and will avoid the mess of cutting it on your own, also the slices are equal size!

Mmmm this pie is yummy for sure, love the chocolate whipped mousse like cream filling and the white whipped cream they use is also tasty. The crust is flaky and tasty as well as the generous garnishment of shaved chocolate! This is a generous and rich pie, well worth the $15 bucks!

They had the old school style refrigerated glass cake and pie display case and a spinning display. That was a blast from the past for sure.

We selected from what they had already made. They had a strawberry shortcake cake with strawberries so large on top. I just could not bring myself to paying $36.00 for a cake when it is not even a special occasion. It sure looks delicious and I think next time I will get a slice to test it out first, I am sure is worth the money as it looked Divine!

When we inquired about the other room with more space we were told its reserved.  Note we took over 2 hours to dine and when we departed that room was NOT IN USE.  Anyway very nice modern decor kinda of novue steakhouse that is a little unusual and interesting. 

Review the menu and we are presented with your standard fare of mix of steaks and chops / appetizers salads etc.  Wine list is extremely overpriced but its a steakhouse in casino and we roll with it.  Couple drinks ordered bottles of wine in route we are off to the races. 

Bread... not served until asked and told it is upon request... WTH?  50.00 average per steak and bead is by request?  Hot fresh rolls with topped butter are good but not the reviews ""To die for"" 

Appetizers:

Couple of wedge salads were cold fresh and good though they needed more dressing and it was promptly delivered. 

Several shrimp cocktail are great looking but to be honest MUSHY and a little fishy and the cocktail sauce was bland with no bite.  Asked for extra lemon, horseradish at time of order yet it never did arrive.  Either way the Shrimp failed. 

Couple of Tuna Tartar's were ordered not my thing but 6 on the 1 to 10 scale from the persons that sampled them. 

Entrees:
Dry Aged Rib Eye was very good tasty and cooked perfectly.

3 Bone in Filet Mignons 1 was outrageously god while the other 2 were simply ok.  Note this is a wet aged prime piece of meat. 

Chillean Sea Bass was once again 6 out of 1-10 scale fort the fish lover.

The ""Ultimate steak"" 40 Oz Portherhouse carved in back not tableside with 1 side and steak sauces was good but lacking any great depth or flavor to the strip or the filet and it was luke warm to cool at serving temperature. This was accompanied by the extra $25.00 stuffed lobster tail.  Well I don't know what this was but it certainly wasn't lobster.  It was  chunks of fish stuffed inside the tail with a ritz cracker bread crumb stuffing. It tasted funky no explanation of what it was but it I've eaten many a Maine Lobster tail and this was NOT IT. 

Two $90.00 stuffed lobsters were absolutely awful.  Same funky lobster taste with the stuffing doing nothing to save these sorry dishes.  

Sides:
Wild mixed roasted mushrooms in oil and garlic were undercooked. 

Mac & Cheese pretty good flavor no complaints here. 

Baked potatoe $10.00 cold and undercooked and certainly not worth 10.00.

Garlic Mashed pretty good.

Broccolini was blah. 

Deserts good especially the donut holes and chocolate dipping sauce.  

Service was OK.. lots of the extras were never brought even though requested during ordering process.  The room must be right next to the broilers in the kitchen as the flame and frying smell permiated through the walls.

All and all a few good things but absolutely totally over priced $1500.00 for 10 people with only 3 small priced bottles of wine and not heavy on the drink orders, makes this place a HORRIBLE VALUE.  Night before we were at Hugo's cellar 10 of us with incredible wine 1k.  No comparison.  As previously mentioned not sure who's reviewing this but THUMBS DOWN For me.",2014-05-03 13:57:05

kYYjIT0_tQV88vmYdiWdUA,rDbTwiJJIOlg6lL7iEdSig,vnvQ0lD9MDje2DFde9PKQA,2,1,0,1,"This is not the worst hotel I have seen, so I am not going to give them a one, but this is no where near the nicer hotels on the strip and it is the least favorite of the Hilton hotels I have stayed at. The hubby and I booked a hotel here, because they called asking us to do a Hilton Grand Vacation tour and see if we wanted to purchase into the property (my husband is also a Hilton Honors member). To get to the check in is kind of doing to much, you have to go through a  down stairs area and take the escalators up to the next level which is where you will find the check in area. The pool is also located directly across from the check in desk, and you can see it through the doors. In my opinion,the pool is not that big for the Vegas life or for the family life the vacation company is trying to promote, but it is larger than the Marriott's time share pool across the way. On our first night we were told no suites were available for an upgrade and we had to stay  in a studio size room. When you walk to your room have to insert your key into a key checker (and they only have two) and there is a security guard checking every single parties key to make sure it works. This is not a smart idea at ALL! I get they are trying to maintain security but if there is a rush of 30 people and you need to get to your room you have to sit there and wait while everyone get's their key checked. In my opinion, if a person is not meant to get up stairs they will A. ) not have a key (which you should just have to show, not insert in device or B.) the guest staying will not let them in the room.

 I am not sure who decorated this hotel, but the color scheme is horrible. The hallways are painted an ugly none glossy red and the floors are the same color with black in it as well. It's just all ugly-- esp. for a hotel that is not over 5 years old. The studio rooms are not cute at all, and I do not recommend. Again they have a red color scheme and the furniture and decorations are just off and ugly. Plus they have these ugly cheap red leather couches in all the rooms. The bathroom is really small, and only has a regular shower and a pull out door closes off the toilet from the rest of the bathroom.  

On our second day we called to ask could we move hotels or upgrade our room. No other hotels in the vacation package were available but we were luckily able to upgrade to a suite. So in Vegas if you need to upgrade during cleaning hours, they make you pack up and leave the room you are in and they will notify you will your next room is available--it sucks and is hassle for the guest but this is pretty standard every where. When we finally came back, the upgraded suite was a little better but the decorations and color scheme were still ugly. The suite had a Jacuzzi, a shower, bigger bathroom, a projector to watch tv (which we thought was really cool, esp so we could watch the NBA finals), new appliances in the kitchen, and a washer/dryer. So, the features of the suite helped with the ugliness. If you need detergent for the washer and dryer, just call the front desk it is free. Neither of the outside views from either room was that great. 

BEWARE if you order Room Service-- They charge you to bring the food to your room and they add the tip in for you and do not allow you to decide how much. My $14.00 nachos and $2 soda ended up being $26.00 by the time they added all their fees, I could have just walked and got myself food.   

I do how like the Elara is connected to the Planet Hollywood hotel--if you wish to shop esp. We also attended a few shows and the J. Lo show while we were there so it was easy access. 


The last thing I have to say about this hotel is my presentation. I did appreciate how my presenter presented to us, but I did not appreciate her saying telling my husband and I, do not go on anymore tours. This was the second time Hilton Grand Vacations called us and it was not OUR fault they forgot to take us off the list and offered us another stay at a different location. We were considering buying into the time share, but we recently found out  (like two weeks before our visit) we are expecting another child and decided it was not in our best interest. You don't tell people DON'T do something again, esp, if they are not breaking the law and the fault was not on us. I didn't appreciate her speaking to us about that. We were more sold on the location of the first tour but after looking this location we will not be buying in if this is the best Hilton has to offer.",2016-06-21 14:55:48

You fill out a card to build your own burger, give it to a waitress, and sooner than you think you'll have a fresh burger in front of your face for all of $2.25.  Hooray!

It took quite some time to get a bartender's attention a few times, although we were drinking some pretty spendy drinks (especially for them, I'm sure.).  Sooner rather than later, we ended up getting a 12 pack and going home.  We had a better time there.",2007-03-05 23:00:57

I wanted to splurge on myself so I decided to dine here. I ordered 

-chinatown clams casino
-hearth baked bread
-beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling
-honey toast

I'm drooling thinking about the food. The clams were the best baked/stuffed clams I've ever had. The uni it was topped with was so fresh and creamy. The bread and the butter was so good and had the perfect crunch. My server brought it out with the dumplings so that I could soak the bread in the dumpling broth. Delicious. The dumplings itself were perfectly seasoned and not too salty like most dumplings are. I was also able to try the maitake mushroom thanks to a friend working there. It was so good, would've never thought hummus and mushroom would pair the way that did. For dessert I opt for the honey toast as a recommendation from my server. Glad I went with that choice. The. Best. Honey. Toast. Everrrrrr. It was brûléed perfectly and was so soft on the inside, topped with fresh strawberries and ice cream. 

I already cannot wait to come back to try the rest of the menu. If you didn't know one of the owners owned SLOboy food (closed, but was amazing). And if you are a regular at Goodwich you may see familiar faces in the kitchen. Try this place, it will not let you down.",2017-10-21 22:32:00

Goat cheese walnut honey ice cream was killer. Creamy and delicious goat cheese with chopped walnuts then honey hand drizzled over it. The strawberry sour cream had an incredible texture and flavor. Not a big fan of the other flavors I have tried. Give me Mitchell's dark chocolate over theirs any day.

I downgraded this to three stars because every time I come there lately (twice in the last few months) they are sold out of their best flavors.

They have great prices & an even better selection than any of the other local grocery stores. They even carry products you wouldn't normally see on the West Coast. However, that being said, they can also be hit or miss with the consistency of their stock. For example, you might find a particular item one week & not be able to get it the next. No matter, their selection more than makes up for it. Whereas you may find 3 brands of a particular item @ your regular grocery store, you will almost always have 3 or more additional selections here.

The produce section here is usually very good, but can be hit or miss @ times, depending on when you go. I have bought some of the best Roma tomatoes I have ever seen...anywhere! & not just locally. Big, red & ripe! Same with the strawberries. Although, there have been times when I have come & been saddened by those very same items. But overall, I don't think you will find a better produce section around town for these prices, unless you go down to Greenland Supermarket.

They also have bulk items, which is pretty awesome. Just about anything you can imagine. My favorite would have to be the honey. It is definitely a lot cheaper buying the honey this way & more delicious in its raw form. The freshly ground nut butters are nice too, if that's what you're into.

The deli section is yet another highlight of Winco. The coldcuts here are brilliant & taste fresh & delicious! The pastrami is great, as well as the salami & Italian roast beef, which I'm not normally a fan of. They will let you sample everything & as many things as you like & they are not stingy with the samples @ all. Also, the rotisserie chickens are delicious & big & very reasonably priced & come in different flavors. The BBQ one is my personal favorite. 

The meat section is usually very good & they have great cuts & selection. Every now & again they will have sales on select cuts, such as ribeye, as low as $5.99 lb. I have tried the ribeye, N.Y. & tri-tip & have been very impressed.

I could probably go on, but I have hit the bullet points. It's up to you now fellow Yelpers, to come to Winco & experience it for yourself. Hopefully someday they will expand beyond Northtown & Hendo. But, until that day don't be afraid to venture outside your grocery store comfort zone & give Winco the chance it deserves.

He had cooked up an amazing grilled cheese with pancetta and tomato bisque. Happily, that's on the menu at his own restaurant, which just opened this last week.

The girlfriend and I decided to try out Beckett's new restaurant tonight and we were simply thrilled. The food included huge portions at fair prices, and it helped that it was delicious. I had the braised short ribs with mashed potatoes and green beans ($19), the girlfriend had the chicken and dumplings ($16). The bread was made in the wood-fired oven and delicious, and the bacon-cheese biscuits ($5) were fantastic. (The bread was so good, I may actually forgo the biscuits next time, sadly!)

Even though it's brand new, the service was absolutely perfect. Our helpful waitress (Tracey) was able to recommend a perfect wine pairing for the girlfriend's meal and was attentive and in a very good mood for being rather close to closing time.

My short ribs were perfectly cooked, full of flavor, and enough to bring home for seconds (factoring in dessert). The girlfriend had plenty of chicken and dumplings leftover and loved her meal, and though she mentioned it was just a bit on the saltier side, she was thrilled to have enough for lunch the next day.

We rounded things out with the chocolate-covered bacon s'mores. That's right. They arrive deconstructed, with each component piece separate on the plate for you to build to your liking. Housemade marshmallow, peanut butter cream, chocolate covered bacon, and graham crackers make for a unique and fun dessert that's just the right amount of food, though it feels utterly indulgent.

The chef and his owner-partner also made sure to greet us and were extremely kind. It's clear they've put a lot of passion into the space and the menu and the food, and it really shows.

change their closing time. Maybe close at 10:30pm instead? I drove all the way from Downtown LV for nothing. To say the least, I'm pissed. Even if their doughnuts taste great, I must say goodbye to this brand. Hello Dunkin Donuts, you got me!!",2016-02-06 18:42:24

I only go here after a night of drinking and I want some soup to sober me up and it's one of the only pho places other than Pho Pasteur that is still open at 2am in the morning otherwise I would never ever go here for Pho.

Most of their business comes late at night from the club crowd who are looking for something to eat and to sober them up. 

Some dishes are not bad but their Pho is pretty bad.
1. Their broth has no flavour.
2. They are guilty of overcooking their noodles quite often.
3. Their meat is quite suspect.

Yes, I go here but only when I'm intoxicated and I'm starting to think that the people that say this is the best Pho in Toronto fall in the late night clubber category.

If you don't agree head to Pho Tien Thanh on Ossington or Pho Linh on College St and you will notice a huge difference in what a authentic bowl fo Pho should taste like. Also, you don't see many Vietnamese ppl or families eating here, which is a true sign of authenticity.

Service: Other than Alex who has been there for years, many of the staff do not know what they are doing or what a lot of the dishes are. We asked for Canh Chua Ca one time, which is a Vietnamese sour fish soup and the guy had no clue what I was asking for until I showed him the menu number.",2011-10-21 19:57:22

I was excited to get there at 11am on a weekday to find the kitchen open, but my happiness was crested when I found out that only a limited menu was served in the time between breakfast and lunch. So, begrudgingly, I chose a goat cheese and vegetable frittata -- one of only two options available. 

Given that there were only two options, I thought I'd get some sort of half-assed meal, but I was totally wrong -- the frittata was awesome: fluffy, perfectly cooked, and served in an individual glazed cast iron ramekin (I'm a sucker for food in individual compartments). I also ordered orange juice, which was fresh-squeezed but not too pulpy.  On my way out, I grabbed some prepared food from the cold cases near the front of the shop to stock the fridge in my nearby rental. Delicious, and without the prefab food taste or feel you might get at other delis.  

The best thing about my visit, however, was non-food related -- the cafe has this great artwork on the walls by an artist named James Kennedy (http://jameskennedy.ca), who uses hot rolled steel to produce these really interesting (and reasonably priced) pieces. My partner and I dug the art so much, we contacted the artist and purchased a piece. So, thanks to Le Cartet, I left with a happy tummy AND a very cool souvenir of my trip to this amazing city. :)",2011-05-22 22:49:24

Went here for my daughter's birthday in early January.  Had to wait 40 minutes on a Saturday night but were able to get some drinks and hang out at the bar.  Was somewhat surprised how expensive the drinks were but we were celebrating.  After waiting 40 minutes the best they could do was cram our party of 5 into a 4 top in the very back corner of the restaurant.  We made the best of it but why even have tables if the experience is less than the best.  Best thing we could say about this table was it was close to the bathroom.  Service was OK but the food was not good.  Probably should have sent it back but by the time we got it we had been there over an hour and a half.  My wife's hamburger was over charred to the level it was charcoal.  My dinner was tasteless and nobody was overly excited about what they had.  5 different dinners and all were at best average and 2 were poor.  Quantity is typically good but for what we ordered this time even that wasn't above average.  Total bill for 5 people was about $250 including drinks and tip.  For that kind of bill, I expect much more.  I don't expect to go back again.

I never had a bad experience, the reason it is only getting 3 stars, is my comparison of it to the Fresh chain downtown. The menu is typical vegan, but I find other establishments have more variety to their menu, which makes the ordering process less stressful if you're not a full-time vegan.

When my roommate and I walked inside, I noticed that the restaurant was busy, so while I was prepared to wait a minute, I was not prepared to be completely ignored by the hostess while she ran from behind the register to deliver something to a table. I figured she would at least acknowledge us upon returning, but instead she went to the kitchen for a few minutes before finally greeting us, which was a relief, since I was starting to think that I had somehow managed to turn invisible. She told us that it would be about ten minutes, and then we sat in the little waiting chairs. 

About five minutes later, another party came in. This was a party of three. They sat down next to us to wait as well. Somewhere between five and ten minutes later, a second party of two entered and stood at the counter. At this point, the hostess says something while gesturing toward a table. Logic dictating that since we were the first arrival, we would be the ones to be seated, I stood and took a step. The hostess quickly shattered the notion with a halting gesture while ushering in the party of three. 

The party that arrived five minutes after me. 

I got angry for a moment, but my roommate pointed out that maybe they seated the party of three first because a larger table was ready first. Grudgingly calmed for a moment, I settled back into my seat. Of course, when the waitress returned and seated the pair of gentlemen that entered AT LEAST ten minutes after us, I may have had a minor meltdown. 

I explained to the manager that there was a chance that her restaurant may just be kind of busy and extremely disorganized, but it kind of felt more like we were ignored because we were the only one of the parties that greeted the hostess in English rather than Korean. 

Any rational human being probably would have left by this point, but this had become a matter of principle. The manager apologized profusely, and my roommate and I followed the hostess to our table. 

Gods below, I wish I were a more rational human being. At least the waitress got our first order of meats correct, and didn't bring something completely unwanted to the table. Meanwhile, the bean paste soup was the first item I had ordered. After three attempts, it was the last item to arrive. Our drink order took two tries, as did our request for hot sauce. And refills? Yeah, if I would have held my breath I would probably be typing this from the beyond. None to be had. I shudder to imagine how this would have went if not for the poor girl bussing tables. Even she was practically ignored when she attempted to bring the waitress back to our table. 

After waiting ten minutes for our check, I quickly paid and gave far more gratuity than was remotely deserved and got out of the place as fast as possible. 

From now on, I'll take my business elsewhere.",2015-01-03 08:49:05
kZHJmP_DfCyS3gCNKHgJvQ,HNvtQAbgSeLBSkmXz2AkSg,NFm869_w6cvVaWaNpAzjeA,5,2,6,5,"Huxley and I tuckered in, situating ourselves cross-splayed at one of the dark-wood tables lining the near wall of Soul's narrow upstairs veranda. She slowly lowered her sunglasses and thumbed back a wayward strand of her salted, birch-blond bangs. She squinted to the morning light diffusing in through the muddled plastic of the zipper-tent enclosing the balcony. ""It's a such a gorgeous day,"" she said. ""It stings.""
I nodded. It was a spectacular February morning, bright, clean and full up with that heavy brisk that forms in the hours just before the cold air of lingering night completely gives way to the warm mug of day. I ran my hands across my face. I looked up to Hux's squinted eyes, her splotchy cheeks, her ragged clumps of unwashed hair. We shared a commiserating smile. 
Presently, our waitress approached - a rangy sprite, narrow and straight, with a black bob, olive skin, and the most adorable pair of black-framed lenses perched atop her strong nose. Quintessential midwood mistress, quirky and divine. 
She absconded to fetch our coffee, and Hux and I reflected: Soul is two restaurants in one. At night, it's a swarming lounge, swollen with music and laughter and flavor and abated light. Tapas dance cruel and sushi rolls mean and the pork-belly tacos punch you right in the gut. But for me, it's the drinks, dear god, the Basil Smashes and the red red wines, they flow so fast and so readily, and it's impossible not to, in an instant, drink yourself drunk. Soul, at night, is not a restaurant to be dined casually. It's a force to reckon; it's a bright hot swill. And if you let it, it'll always take you where you want to be. But then there's that other Soul. That once a week daylight binge, the Sunday brunch, the counterpoint to your drunk drunk nights. Haggard with heads low and eyes tight and feet ashuffle, skittering down the cracked sidewalk, all the denizens of the late-night world awake and wander together, inexorably drawn here, to this place, this dazzling place, that opens itself up to us in its most vulnerable hours to feed our faces with the most glorious menu of hang-over spurnables your wasted mind could imagine. 
Our waitress returned with our coffee and cream. I delighted. Huxley ordered the scrambled egg pierogies; I went with the shrimp and grits. 
We sipped our brew, strong, warm and rich, for a bit, until, in too little time, our waitress returned. ""So..."" she began, ""the kitchen is a little out of sorts this morning...  we're out of pierogies."" 
""That's fine,"" Hux said, so sweet and demure. ""I'll have the mac and cheese.""
We soaked up the warming air and forced our eyes to let in a little more of the morning light. I turned sideways in my chair and leaned my head and shoulders back against the brick wall. I looked up and admired the amber light seeping from the antique sconces stationing the upper perimeter. ""I love this place,"" Huxley said, gazing dream-faced out into the steadily enlivening miasma of Central ave. 
I smiled. ""Me too."" 
""Can we order mimosas?""
I glanced down at my watch; it was ten to noon. ""Nope, not yet."" 
Our waitress returned with our plates: I was presented with a magnificently arranged tray set upon with fried building blocks of sweet southern grits, smothered in shrimp and andouille and a spicy cream; Hux was handed a messy little cast-iron bowl of corkscrew macaroni drenched in hot white cheddar and topped with bacon and chive, and it was all the best and worst things she or I could desire. 
Our hearts swelled and our throats filled up and we salivated like wild, unfettered things. Without care or consideration, we devoured. Savory delights not fit for any creatures such as ourselves, not on that morning, not after that night, but that's what Soul brunch is... that's what it does. It fixes you, it heals you, it restores in you whatever semblances and sensibilities the previous night had taken away. It fills you full, deep and complete, with exactly what you need. 
The waitress returned, two tall cylinders of nectar in hand, and placed them on the table. ""Sorry about the pierogies,"" she said. ""These are on the house."" 
I gaped, I gawked, I mooned those two glasses. Juice and champagne, a marriage of substances not easily rivaled, the crowning gesture of an exceptional morning. ""Mimosas..."" I said in a slur.

I went there for the first time for a Yelp Elite  event.  The front was rammed with people. I don't think that they were ready for the hoards of people that the event was expected to bring in. 

So we watched them with interest and intensity as they rolled out pre-prepared trays of fresh dough, prepared the pizzas in a production line fashion and slid them into 2 high speed ovens.  They were able to prepare 10 pizzas at a time. Swarms of people hovered by the bar where the pizzas were being served waiting with empty plates like a pack of vultures.  We waited with anticipation as we watched them slide in the pizzas with a long wooden paddle.  Some people held out their plates to be served.

We were able to taste two kinds of pizzas after a long wait.  Margherita pizza - tomato sauce, fresh buffalo mozarella, drizzle of fresh olive oil and basil.  The pizza was de-li-cious!!!  The crust was thin, the cheese was melt-in-your mouth, and the basil was fresh.  The second pizza was roasted potatoes with olives, buffalo mozarella and tomatoes.  The potatoes tasted like scallopped potatoes and the pizza was very tasty though we all agreed it needed something extra like spinach or sauce.

Slices of pizza were flying off plates and people were drawn in like moths to a flame when the pizzas were plated.

The guy who was making the pizza looked extremely serious. Intense gazing and concentration was trepidating through the kitchen. One yelped dared joke he was like the pizza nazi - ""no pizza for you!"".  

Near the end of the night, there was one more remaining slice of margherita pizza. It sat there on its own.  My friend was tapped on the shoulder by a woman to find out if anyone wanted that last lone slice. He told her that it looked as though someone had taken a bite out of it but put it back on the plate. She grabbed the slice yelling out ""I'll take my chances"".

Food -   So many options on the menu.  Everything looked so good.  The waitress was helpful with our questions and help narrow it down.  So here is what we decided on:

- Combination appetizer.  We picked Hummus, Dolmades and Falafels.   I would say that the Dolmades were the best.  They practically melted in your mouth.  Hummus was second best that had a very smooth consistency.  Finally the Falafel.  Personally I think that it was a little over done. 

- Chicken Swarma wrap.  My wife had this and thought it was good.  I had a bite  and thought it was also good.  

- Gyro Wrap.  This was my second choice as they didn't have Lamb Swarma.  Not sure how that happens but the Gyro was good.  The meat wasn't as seasoned as what I have had in the past but it was good.  

Service-   So we were pretty disappointed with the service.   The restaurant was moderately busy but they only had one waitress.  I don't blame her because she was running the entire time.   It's really bad that she was put in that situation.

Food was so so towards good/ok. 

Was asking for a booth. Said that all the booth are reserved. But no body was on the booth that near our table. Ask the receptionist after done eating now they said all that three back tables can't be used (closed). It's just weird and very unprofessional. At least explain to the customer why those tables can't be used and apologize for us not getting our booth.

Timing for the food was very off. My husband got his soup and salad and only literally couple seconds later his tonkatsu is delivered. But our sushi appetizer haven't even come and I have to wait quite a while until my spicy tuna bowl is delivered.
Food tasted ok. Had better elsewhere. Value for your non-sushi food is good. But value for the sushi is overrated. Specialty sushi rolls that we ordered were sloppy. Fish wasn't cut uniformly on the roll. Sushi rice was falling off the roll, it's like it wasn't tightly rolled. For $11-13 per roll, I expect better. Especially with a lot of AYCE sushi options in the town of Las Vegas.
 
Our waiter John was nice. He recognized the timing was off and apologized for it. Good guy. Gave him decent tip for it.

We don't buy meat, dairy or produce at Giant Eagle in general just because the quality is better elsewhere and we prefer organic milk and eggs. But for regular stuff - stuff that we would buy anywhere - cereal, tortillas, chips, crackers, peanut butter, flour, sugar, and on and on - the prices are generally much better at GE than elsewhere. 

Couple this with the Fuelperks and doubled coupons which are 99c or less, its hard to beat GE for standard stuff. Also love the Fuelperks on every $50 spent on gift cards. Stop here for a Lowe's or Amazon gift card before dropping cash there, and you'll get free gas before you know it.

Moving forward, I'm using United Blood Services to donate.  I'm told that I can donate as much as 3-4 times a year and feel it's my duty to do so. Signing up is easy (go online or stop in) and donating blood is a great way to give back.  Donating also serves as a good check if anything is wrong with you health wise.  Not a catch 22, but a ""knock two birds with one stone"" type of thing for me. The initial process includes a mini interview where they ask you a bunch of personal questions like how often you smush, if you're a drug user, and if you have any known diseases.  After you get past the questions, you're ready to donate.  I can't remember the name of the procedure, but chose the longer procedure.  I figure if I'm going to give, I'm giving a lot. 

I can't end this review without commenting on the staff.  Overall, they are great, friendly, and at least have a decent enough personality to hold a conversation.  Maybe it's just me because I don't mind talking to strangers, especially if they have a large needle stuck up my arm. 

On a side note, thanks to Mimi J. of Bakersfield. We're competing on review count for 2013, more like motivating each other.

However, playing pool in their back section was a bit of um....an unforgettable experience. It wasn't that the pool table was not in the best shape or that the room wasn't big enough to house the table making it interesting shooting. More so because you may end up stabbing men with your stick as they walked out of the washroom. The icing on the cake for me was the lovely strong scent of pee emanating  from the women's washroom. Oh, it was killing me every ttme the door opened. I was informed it was much better now because of renovations. I can't imagine before.

Food was pub fare. Greasy and meant to just have something in your stomach as you drank the beer. This makes total sense. I rarely go into a pub expecting food to be good.

I think this is the place for you if you want to sit and enjoy the game with a few drinks under your belt but other than that if you are expecting more, you maybe disappointed.",2013-01-16 16:08:43

I definitely have had much better sushi at other places and this place is just mediocre to me. Nothing really stood out. Yes they have plenty of specialty rolls to choose from, and I got to try most of their ""Top 10"" rolls, and I admit they were good, like the ""Fantasy Roll"" , it had cream cheese and eel sauce and avocado and shrimp on top of a spicy tuna roll.

Would I go back? sure, it wasn't bad nor was it memorable, it was just ok. I didn't like the fact that they charged for their desserts and they had a limit on the mochi. The good news: they serve 4 nigiri pieces per order.. when its usually 2 anywhere else.",2011-07-22 22:37:14

The meal I had the other night consisted of a cup of potato leek soup (always delicious) and a couple handful of my friend's decked-out fries, which were fine. Another friend's fish sandwich look alright, but he said the curry sauce was dreadful and the fish was mediocre. He struggled to finish it. A pulled pork sandwich was also ordered, which was fine and dandy.

Will probably stop back in the future. I've had their shepherd's pie a few times, and it was always good. A few of my friends have had birthday shindigs at the downtown location over the years, and it's always been a good time.

My glass of water was never empty, the table crumbs were promptly wiped away and clean plates and utensils were regularly brought out. 

Needless to say, the service was impeccable and the food was great too!

Location/Atmosphere:
The restaurant is set back from the street, just west of Weslodge - not east, as one review suggested. The overall ambience is dark and intimate (albeit with fairly high ceilings), with a nice covered patio. The decor is tastefully hip - lots of needlepoint accents, but nothing too oppressive, (no moose antlers or owls here).  

Dishes:
There are a lot of options on the menu and I found it a bit overwhelming so we asked our waiter to arrange a tasting course.

We left in a comatose so I can't remember all of the dishes.  Some of the standout dishes included the following:

- Bacon-covered Dates (DÁTILES CON TOCINO IBÉRICO): really really good, although one could argue that bacon + dates + cheese will always be good.  Still, it was better than I was hoping and it has some Guindillas peppers to boot.

- Ibérico Pork Flank cooked sous vide style served with a sweet Piquillio Pepper Jam (ECRETO IBÉRICO CON PIMIENTOS DE PIQUILLO Y MERMELADA).  The pork was incredibly tender and the sweet pepper jam provided a nice contrast.

- Octopus on potatoes with paprika and olive oil (PULPO A LA GALLEGA). Another one-two punch of flavours.  This was one of my favourites.

The meal ended with PAELLA PATRIA, a seafood paella dish served on a large plate.  It was really nice mix of saffron with shrimp, mussels, cuttlefish, scallops, snap peas and monkfish.

We also had a few other dishes including house baked bread with fresh tomato and olive oil, Serrano ham and Manchego cheese.  We also had some blistered peppers with sea salt (PIMIENTOS DE PADRÓN).

For dessert, we had Churros and Fried Milk.

Overall, for three people including 4 cocktails, it was about $200+ with tax.

Bottomline: 
Fantastic service, great food.",2015-09-07 20:50:32

But otherwise, it's a good place.  The person at the counter was really nice. He offered us to try out his home made sauces (one mild, one garlic/spicy and one spicy).  We were able to take the bottles to our table to use.  Which was nice.  There's a couple of chairs outside on the sidewalk which I'm guessing would be ok to have a dog there.

This restaurant is within walking distance, so I was really, really hopeful.We came on a Monday and it was vacant in the dining room. One other couple  was just leaving. There were a few folks at the bar and they looked like they were having a good time. I thought about coming back for a drink as we were being seated. I'm still thinking about it but I won't be eating. 


We started with the fried calamari - it was okay and oddly on the dry side for a fried item, I'd almost guess it was frozen and had been microwaved. We  both ordered the specials and they were awful. The pasta with tomato cream sauce and the chicken and sauteed vegetables.  Both were scalding hot to the taste, lackluster, bland and really, really salty. I got the impression the dishes had been frozen and microwaved on blast. It caused the sauce to actually bubble on my plate. The bread that was brought was good and my side salad was tasty. The dipping sauce for the bread was a little odd- grated Parmesan and olive oil. Makes for a gluey dip. 

The service was impeccable. Due to above mentioned saltiness, I powered through 3 glasses of water and the waiter was right there with the pitcher. So, excellent service, hence the 3 stars and the hope that they might have a decent bar. I'm a sucker for a good bar, so I'll be back and report my findings. Wish me luck .",2010-02-16 06:23:53

Upon entering, the doorway seemed extremely small and not very welcoming but I was greeted and told to wait for a table to be freed up. I waited for approximately 10 minutes and then got seated, which was weird since a full 8 person table was empty with a reserved sign on it, the party still hadn't shown up once I was finished with my hour and a half meal.

The service is what gave it the 2 stars but the food was not good at all. I am a sashimi eater and so I expect a certain level of freshness. That was not present at all. They did have a wide variety of food to choose from and the udon soup noodles weren't too bad but came in the smallest bowl. 

I love Japanese food and I have to say that as an Asian person, this specific restaurant was geared more toward the cakers of the world because I thought the food was subpar and not worth the money but all I hear from friends are raves.

Only two parties (including mine) were present in the restaurant. The second time was during Cinco de Mayo -- very busy! 

Service 4.5/5 -- Although both experiences were very different, I experienced positive customer service. There's a server there who is extremely helpful who served us the first time... He's the guy who also works at Firefly! 

My second time I sat at the bar to eat and had a bartender on our side who was busy. He was an older gentleman with white hair. He was quite inattentive with us and I understand how busy it was (I work in the restaurant business as well) but I really found it hard to capture his attention, especially when I was ready to order things. I personally felt like he skipped over us and couldn't even give us a ""okay, be right there"" type of response. He did end up noticing that I was probably slightly irritated and offered us free shots and a drink. The fact that he acknowledged it made me feel better about the service and the free things just made my experience way better!

Price 4/5 -- it's like $11-14 for three tacos. They're pretty delicious, though, and the food comes with delicious rice and beans and chips and salsa. It was $10ish for the Blood Orange Magarita. 

Food 4.5/5 -- the tacos are delicious! I had the pollo and carne asada tacos. I am a huge fan with how fresh it tasted! The meat wasn't dry like some other places and the tacos had the right flavors. The Spanish rice that comes with your meal was also sooooooo delicious. I sometimes crave it! The guacamole is delicious as well! Yummy yummy. The salsa is free and yummy as well!

I ordered the blood orange margarita and it was so delicious! Does it even have any alcohol?! I could drink it like juice. The tequila shots we ordered were in the cutest cups too.

(Borax makes great slime-and my students love it). After she cleaned up the tiny spill of borax she put it in a bag, and I asked if I could have it doubled bagged. Paula then went on to tell me that next year I will have to pay for extra bags.

Naked chicken wings with the extra hot sauce as I had requested were as tepid as the sauce, on the side and not dressed, was insipid. Frank's red hot with some butter and probably a sprinkle of cayenne, and a heavy handed addition of ""grossness"" were the worst I've had in recent memory.

My favorite BBQ item is Burnt Ends. Lovingly smoked twice and over seasoned and carcinogenic in the best way possible. Dillons' interpretation is rather unique: boil some pork, cut in cubes, dump on dirty plate and smother in brown gravy infested with cornnstarch and liquid smoke. Worst I've had in recent memory. 

Oh, and that big ol' cold beer I was anxiously desiring...a 12 oz glass with two times more fingerprints on it than beer in ounces. I counted twelve separate greasy paw prints. Do the math and you'll figure out the ratio. Worse ratio of prints to ounces I've had in recent memory.

Only because every time I go, they always seem to run out of dumplings which is disappointing. 
I wanted to try the chicken and mushroom dumplings but they told me they didn't have any.
So I ended up just getting the pan fried pork dumplings, fried onion pancake and kung pao chicken. 

Pan Fried Pork Dumplings - it's an extra $1 to get it pan fried. Only one side was fried and the other wasn't (so odd).
I didn't like that one side of the dumpling was slightly crisp while the other was soggy and watery. Did not like the combination of oily and watery either. The filling was good other wise.

Fried Onion Pancake - this was absolutely delicious. A little greasy but still sooo good!

I was reading reviews like some people read trashy romance novels. Lusting over descriptions of meaty juicy burgers and grown up milkshakes. Let me rephrase that DECADENT grown up milkshakes.

I don't know when I became so impatient, but the 75 minutes wait felt like ETERNITY. I think my biggest issue is that now that restaurants use a text or call to your cell phone, it often times seems as if people are just walking in and being sat before us. The weather was mild though so sitting outside on the bench was nice. 

The interior, while small is very hip and clean. Great signs and branding through the space. Concrete and brick floors and high ceilings. It does follow along with the current trend of very dark eateries though, I don't want buzzing fluorescent lighting but I would like to see my food when it comes out.

My all opted for Build Your Own burgers. Two of us getting beef while the other two got veggie burgers. I ordered mine red inside and it was mostly pink. I would have been surprised if it had come out red inside though as most places don't want to accommodate that. Everything about the burger was great from the flavor of the meat (no rub) to the huge slice of pineapple, to the sharp provolone cheese, and Bourbon BBQ sauce. 

Honestly, even this morning all I can think about is the red velvet cupcake milkshake with cake infused vodka in it. I can still taste it. Topped with whipped cream and a red velvet cake lollipop dipped in  chocolate and a cherry pie filling type drizzle.

The workers are always super friendly. I ordered a birthday cake here and couldn't have been more pleased. I would highly recommend ordering cakes here. It was ready when I needed it, and super delicious. 

They have punch cards for purchases of their adorable bundlets and bundtinis. 

My favorite has to be red velvet. It's literally my favorite red velvet cake anywhere that I've purchased one. It's not overly sweet, you can taste the cocoa flavor, and they put chocolate chips in it. Amazeballs. Plus their cream cheese icing is great. It has the tanginess that you expect in it, great smooth texture, just the right amount of vanilla and sugar. 

My next favorite is the white chocolate raspberry. It has a really great quality raspberry purée swirled into a white chocolate batter. The sweetness of this cake is pretty intense, but it's still really good. 

The lemon is nice. It's a great lemon cake with their usual cream cheese frosting. You get the brightness of the lemon flavor with just enough sugar. Super good. 

Their carrot cake is just ok. I wasn't impressed by it. However, my mom loved it. I just thought the flavor wasn't as impressive as the aforementioned other 3. My mom thought it was perfect for her. Aside from the red velvet, this is her favorite. 

Plus if you sign up in their email list, you get to know when they have new/seasonal flavors, and on your birthday, they send you an email for a free bundlet. And now your birthday can be even better.",2015-10-07 19:02:53

I wanted to try something completely different this time around and so I elected to go with the Kaas (""pork/beef/parrano cheese/light smoke"") on a bun with Sweet Sauteed Onions and Sauteed Jalapenos.

It's really, really good. The sausage kind of resembles a kielbasa but this is miles beyond any kielbasa I've ever had. The pockets of oozing cheese certainly enhances the whole thing, as does the smokiness running throughout. And the onions and jalapenos proved a perfect complement to the dish.

We also shared the Dirty Duck Fries (""Peppers, jalapeños and sauteed onions topped with our WVRST special sauce""), because this is a must-order when stopping by. And as usual, it was sublime. The perfectly-cooked fries are accompanied by delicious peppers and jalapenos, and the entire concoction is tied together with that absolutely delicious special sauce.

It was soo good back then maybe being 20 something was the difference and we had a tonne of jugs.

When I went with the kids for lunch we had ceasar salad and a large pizza, it taste just like the delivery or take out nothing better, actually the people who own it seem to be a bit over the whole experience.

Scottsdale is actually my hometown of sorts. I spent my teenage to early 20's years in this town. Its fun to be a tourist now.

Was surprised to learn this spire is somewhat legit. That credibility is difficult to find in a city full of chain restaurants, Walgreens, rich white people and mega-resorts. Reading the bronze placard, I learned it was designed by a disciple/student of big Frank LW. Cool.

It is pretty impressive up close. The location is somewhat unfortunate, that corner of Scottsdale and Bell is Uber - busy and very loud. When you take a pic (see mine) you will either see a busy road in the background, or ""Romano's Macaroni Grill"" awnings. Typical Scottsdale views.

The fountain and resulting reflection pool was a nice little spot to contemplate, and watch birdies flit around. I recommend coming here early morning to beat the heat in summertime. Bring water.

I've been going through a bizarre period of craving Benihana all the damn time recently and I get my fix at this location.

I've had a couple of incidents at this location with the way they've handled the bill but the manager is fabulously attentive and has always made it right, assuring that I will be back for more. 

A lot of these reviews are pretty cynical about this joint and I'm not really sure why. No, I wouldn't come here specifically for sushi. Yes, this seems to be quite a destination for birthdays and you will hear that birthday jingle many times throughout the night. Yes, this is best suited to a special occasion given the cost but I always leave with leftovers for the next day. Yes, they cook with a lot of sodium and butter so if you're watching your figure, take heed. It's a noisy joint with a lot happening everywhere so if you're looking for a quiet place to take your sweetie, this may not be the restaurant for you. 

The Chef's Table is a very good perk - they provide you with a $30 gift certificate for your birthday, hence all that singing.

The reason for the four stars instead of the five is because there have been too many times that I have been here when our server seemed less then interested in serving us.  While they are almost always quick and attentive, some need a bit more personality and a smileV
Anyways, the food is really great!  Each meal begins with warm chips and home made salsa.  Their salsa tastes fresh and is more heavy on the cilantro.  I really like how there is not huge chuncks of tomatoes or onions.  They have a wide array of chicken, seafood beef and vegetarian dishes.  My favorite meal to order is the Quesadilla Verde.  It is a tortilla stuffed with cheese, avacado, peppers, lettuce and I always add some beans in there.  As for an appetizer, the chorizo and queso dip is amazing.  Warm melted cheese and spanish sausage is served with warm tortillas for dipping.  Cozumel also has many margarita flavors and delicious cocktails.",2016-12-30 04:01:37

A couple of my girlfriends and I came here to celebrate one of their birthdays. This place was about 60% full on a Tuesday night when we got there, which I took to be a pretty good sign. It quickly filled up in the next hour or so. 

We ordered: beer, plum wine, green papaya salad, a yellow chicken curry, penang chicken curry and the Evil Jungle Princess dish. That was my choice. 

Drinks: They were good Plum wine was a little sweet, but I was expecting that. 

Food: For the majority of the dishes, you get to choose to add a protein and also a spice level. We went with a mix of no spice/medium spice. 

Green Papaya salad - It's one of my favourite Thai dishes, and they do a superb job here with the balance of flavours. My only complaint was that there was a lot of lettuce used as a filler, but the tangy fish/lime sauce went great with this as well. 

Yellow chicken - it's mostly potatoes and chicken. DELICIOUS.

Penang chicken - My family is from Singapore where the cuisine is very similar to Penang, Malaysia, but I couldn't really guess what the Penang curry would taste like. I think there's more depth to the flavours than the yellow curry, and the dish had a richer colour to it. It was really good however, and came with more vegetables than the yellow curry.

Evil Jungle Princess - I had to. Basically, this was a bunch of vegetables cooked in some kind of curry substance that tops a plate of noodles. I forgot there were noodles and also ordered a bowl of rice. For future reference: that bowl of rice is not necessary. This was a really good dish and had a bit more tang to it than the other curries. I really enjoyed that there were a TON of vegetable in this dish. So many in fact that I'm glad I ordered it without a protein.

The servings were large, and we all took food home with us. Fun fact: TSA will look at your leftovers through the x-ray machine and search your bag. 

Service: It was great. People were friendly.

Ma Po Tofu was a souped-up (no pun intended) version of whatever-in black bean sauce.

Greens (bok choy, choy sum, etc) are delicious here. Flecks of browned garlic abounding, yay! 

But if you're looking for veggie-friendly Dim Sum, you'll need to make special plans. When I inquired, I was told it wouldn't be a problem with a week's notice and a large-ish guest list.

I had the coureur des bois: a spicy, but flavorful brunch item.  Don't order it if you can't handle spicy food.

They seemed fine when my pet was rather healthy, but as she got older, she seemed to get odd diagnosis.  I continued with their prescription treatments for a week, but my pet didn't get any better, so like any good ""mom"", I got a second opinion elsewhere.  It was a night and day difference!!  Central Phoenix Animal Hospital had said my pet had a parasite, something that is diagnosed with a easy test...the new vet did the same test and said ""NO WAY!!""  My pet ACTUALLY had hyper thyroidism, not a parasite.  (my pet NEVER goes outside, so I thought it was weird that he would get a parasite).  After 7 days on the proper medication, my pet was healthy and back to normal.  This vet also misdiagnosed another issue my pet had...like REALLY MISdiagnosed her (saying she broke a bone...SHE DIDN'T!!!).  I felt sick about it.  I also didn't like the way they handled my pet when she was injured...I know they want to protect themselves, but they were REALLY rough with her (I offered to help, but they just manhandled her instead.)  

If you have an adorable little healthy puppy or healthy kitty, they're fine.  They're actually pretty nice usually and I know they probably help out a lot of people who don't have much money (I saw a few instances of people not having a lot of money and they'd work with them), but, if you really need GOOD vet care, I'd go somewhere else.  

Oh yeah...the last time I was in there, they were joking around in the lobby and two women came out of one of the examine rooms, obviously upset, crying, etc. It was obvious that they just had to put their animal down.  No one stopped joking and laughing...they just yucked it up while these two women fought back sobbing...it was so sad.

Tucked away and tightly run, this restaurant understands how to move people right through their meal, which I think is great. I was coming off a cold and wanted nothing more than the homecooked feel of spaghetti and meatballs, which I had with the house chianti and the famous house garlic knots. 

Best spaghetti and meatballs ever. The sauce was impeccable, balanced but distinct flavor, and light enough not to stop your stomach a few bites in. Pasta was just as perfect - you know you've had a good meal when you remember how much you enjoyed the experience of simply eating it. I'm not usually capable of putting a lot away, but I finished the entire plate, and got a congratulatory, ""Good job, boss"" from my cameriere. Much better than the chiding he gave the Italian sitting next to me, who was apparently letting his pizza get too cold while texting.

Their pastry selection was pretty good too. I opted for the orange olive oil cake and a beverage called the Matador, which is basically a mocha with cinnamon on top. Eager for my coffee (which is roasted on the premises), I sat at one of their super comfortable couches only to find that their coffee is SUB-PAR. The beans were either over-roasted or the shots were not pulled correctly. I was disappointed but returned a few days later to do some work and give them another chance. The second time around, I encountered the same problem. Burnt-tasting espresso shots and a dried out tart. I have come to the conclusion that either their espresso machines are not calibrated correctly or they just don't know how to do espresso.

I just had my second take out lunch from NR yesterday, a huge order of Pho (P7 with broccoli and bok choy, $1 extra for tofu) that I wasn't even able to finish. 

When you order take out the Pho comes in a styrofoam cup, the sprouts, jalapeno, basil, siracha and lime are in a baggy, and the noodles and tofu are in the takeout box. I had to separate about half of the broth out of the cup because it was filled to the brim and there was no room for the other goodies. Then I went to work adding all my treats and created a massive pho that was just spicy enough with the little cup of siracha. No I will say that the siracha has some brown sauce mixed in, like soy sauce or something with high sugar (fish sauce?). I wasn't wild about the sweetness that lingered because of that. 

What more can I say? It filled and warmed my belly, burned my esophagus and staved off my 'i haven't eaten lately' crankiness.",2009-12-03 18:20:00

It tastes ok for a $3 creme brulee it's like half the price compare to other places and the size is smaller too.

Nitrogen ice cream has made its way to uptown Markham. They make their ice cream in-house right in from of you, finishing off with liquid nitrogen. It's dense, creamy and not overly sweet which I like. 

They have vanilla, matcha and chocolate ice cream as their base along with various toppings to choose from but would like to see more complex combinations in the future to kick it up a notch.

Top picks for me would be the lemon as well as the chocolate whiskey ice cream.

Our creds: late 30's executives...DINK's so we enjoy fine dining often. Favorite Gastro-pub in Valley: Citizen Public House Scottsdale...also love Cowboy Caio in Scottsdale.

Pros:
- walking distance to downtown venues
- industrial chic decor
- best cocktail menu I have ever seen

Cons:
- Ironically, the food. Appetizers: pork bellies and cheddar biscuit apps. Pork bellies...we KNOW pork bellies...all over foodie menus across town...these were like rubber bacon. If you want fantastic pork bellies, go to Citizen Public House or Arrogant Butcher. Cheddar biscuits were good but nothing interesting. Dinner: husband had pork neck..it was nice looking but very ordinary and bland. I had Fried Quail...it was yummy...tasted exactly like KFC...came with cold corn bread, cold gravy and precisely 5 cold beans...could not taste the foie gras in the cornbread. Husband asked for bread to have with his pork neck soup...server said they didn't have bread but he would ask the kitchen...he came back with 2 tiny crostinis in a soup bowl...dry, tasteless, odd.

- The service. Hostess (on 9/30 at 5pm) tried to seat us in an almost empty dining room at the one table right next to the table bussing station. REALLY? We asked for another table and she said we can't have any other table because she had to save those for groups of 4...completely understood so we took a table in a far corner. 5 minutes later she sat a couple at the 4-up...she was also unfriendly and didn't seem to want to be there. Our server was blah and wasn't at all passionate about the menu options...Servers at Arrogant Butcher are awesome!

The service is also really worth mentioning.  We were seated promptly, and we literally had three people assisting us, constantly making sure we were happy, cleaning the table, etc.  The only weird part was that they had the table all set when we walked in, and the first thing they did was remove the plates!  Strange.

So we did not come here for happy hour and sit in the lounge, but we should have.  I thought the dinner was good but not worth the money we paid for it, which came out to about $225 including tax and tip.

For apps, husband ordered the french onion soup which had a great flavor but was ruined by the insane amount of salt in the broth.  He said had it not been for the sodium this would have been his favorite french onion soup, and he's had lots.  We still have not found a place in Vegas that makes better french onion soup than 13 Coins in Seattle. Not Bouchon, and not Mon Ami Gabi either.  If someone knows of good places, please let me know!  I ordered the Hank's house salad which was absolutely yummy.  It isn't a type of salad I normally get but it was like a BLT salad, chopped, with avocado.  Very memorable and delicious.  I have no idea what kind of dressing they put on it but it was slightly creamy.

For entrees husband had the bone-in New York strip, which was supposed to be dry aged.  He ordered it medium rare, but it came out very rare.  He thought it was very good but he was struggling with the insane amount of fat on the meat.  whole portions of the meat were so fatty it was almost inedible.  I ordered the petite fillet, medium rare, but it came out and I cut into it, it was cold.  It was as if they cooked my fillet before the New York and then let it sit for an hour or something.  I know I should have sent it back, but I ate it anyhow.  We had the truffled tater tots which I thought were too overpowering and I could only eat a few, as could my husband.  I also had some wild mushrooms that were pretty good and went well with my steak.

All in all an ok meal, definitely not worth what we paid.  We'll definitely be going back though,as they made the best martinis I've ever had, but we'll stick with the lounge and go for happy hour.  For the quality of drinks, what we paid for them was a total bargain.",2010-06-10 04:16:36

We went in earlier this afternoon and purchased a brand new PS4, an extra controller and a couple of games.

When we arrived home and opened the box we were very disappointed. Inside the package was clearly repacked poorly, cords in various places, cardboard edging damaged. The Controller was damaged, including missing the entire top/padding of the left analog stick.

The console itself was worse, in places the case was splintered, with slivers of plastic coming lose. The shinier side of the PS4 was covered in scratches and smudges like you would expect after years of use and exposure. Lastly the bottom of the console was smeared with gum.

I brought the item back to exchange and do have to say the lady that helped us at the counter was incredibly friendly and helpful, but in the process uncovered further issues with the original purchase.

During the purchase of a PS4 the employee is supposed to scan in the PS4's unique serial number onto the receipt. The employee had not done so. While waiting for a new PS4 to be brought up and processing the exchange the two employees mentioned the employee who made the original sale by name and did so in a way that clearly suggested they were suspicious of his behavior.

Given this and given that this was a damaged, used PS4 inside a locked case. The conclusion is simple. Either a return was processed where an employee did a poor job checking the system over, or an employee in the electronics department performed a switch and took a new system in place of the old one.

Due to the fantastic service I received at the guest desk, and the somewhat shady behavior of the original employee I Must conclude the latter. I hope Target investigates this thoroughly and that no one else is being passed shoddy or damaged goods in place of new.",2015-01-16 03:46:41

The Clever Koi's in my sight
And we're attending for a bite
As the Udon noodles passes by

How it makes my senses come alive.....!
It's the way it's tasting I just can't deny....!
Bo Bites gotta have a go

We found buns in The Clever Koi

This place definitely drew my interest!  Very Clever indeed!  I attended with my foodie group so a lot of sharing.

We ordered a bunch of stuff, but I only remember what we ordered on my side of the table were the Peking duck and octopus bun, the katsui rice, gluten free and regular massamen udon noodles. 

To start my Peking duck was very good except I didn't care much for the charred plum jam.  It just overpowered everything in the bun.  The octopus bun was okay too, I rather eat it nigiri style.  The chicken katsui rice was very good again, but again I thought the teriyaki sauce was just doused over too much.  I like to taste the other ingredients sorry.  My favorite which was not my main dish was the massamen udon noodles. The red curry broth really made this dish pop while the crunch of the nuts gave it texture.  The roast duck and potatoes just melted on your palates while the cilantro gave it a welcoming aroma! - Enjoy!

The place itself had an Asian flare with a modern gastropub feel.  Nice to hangout for a quick bite or to check out their specialty drinks, which they have plenty!  Service can be spotty, but every waiter/waitress has their day! - Enjoy!",2014-03-31 18:03:07

I was there with a girlfriend of mine after just having dined at Casa Rasta next door.

It's a neat space and owned by the Bar Marco crew, so they have extended the model of craft mixology with premium ingredients.

It was crowded but not brimmed, [it was 10:30pm so this may change throughout the remainder of a Saturday. I ordered a whiskey sour with the added non-required egg white ingredient. The mixologist was good enough to ask which version I preferred.

Now to outline the common criticism of the bar: It's too popular!

Each of our drinks took 20 minutes to get to us and another 15 minutes to get the attention for the final bill. Usually, this is a death-sentence for a popular bar however the Livermore will get a pass.

As the model serves craft drinks only [no soft drink products in the vicinity] a drink will take a minimum of 3 minutes to make from start to finish + ordering time + adding the drink to queue [cash register] + delivery. this averages to at least 5 minutes a drink per customer. 

At a rate of 15-20 intended orders over a span of 30 minutes will make it impossible for this bar to deliver a premium drink in a ""manageable"" popular bar delivery time of 10 minutes or less [can you tell I am writing this review during MBA Operations class??]

However! This system is perfectly acceptable when you are visiting the Livermore during an off-peak time. The atmosphere is lovely and the decor is appropriate and the bar tenders have seemingly lost their Bar Marco snob attitude in their commute from the Strip District.

Conclusion: Go to this bar for delicious drinks either to start off the night on Fridays and Saturdays or during the weekdays. - Will be returning there myself during that timeframe.",2015-01-29 01:46:26
inHo3yzg-CC5tCgtynw65A,Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,4,2,1,1,"Sakana is one of my two favorite joints when it comes to AYCE sushi (the other is Sushi Koma.) If it wasn't for the attitude from some of the waiters and weird furniture arrangement, I would have given Sakana 5 stars instead of 4.

Now, let's talk about price and get it out of the way. The price is very similar to most AYCE sushi joints, $20.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner. 

What about the food? Luv it!!!! Their rice to fish ratio is awesome and the best I've seen so far. The fish was fresh and the portion is plentiful. I highly suggest you try the Salmon Kama, it's the bomb.

Like I mentioned earlier, what I don't like about this place is their service and furniture layout. Some of the staff are nice, but most of them barely cracked a smile (including the owner lady) and they gave the ""order one time, eat fast and get out"" kinda look. In term of furniture, their setup created a bottleneck and make wait time extra long. In their not so big dinning area, they have a long table that can seat probably 12 - 14 people in the middle of the dinning room and I rarely see this table being occupied. They also have a lot of 4-people tables which they don't like to seat party of two, therefore it ended up with a whole bunch of 2 party groups waiting to be seated while there are empty tables. I hope my description makes sense :-)

Overall, I still like Sakana and most likely will go for lunch since it's less busy and don't have to wait long for a table.",2015-01-28 19:22:02

She stated  ""no just today"" So I am like okay can you refund me, and she did, we waited 40 minutes, many people got served, we thought maybe they phoned ordered to eat in or something

Then I got up and waited to place order for two more takeout dinners, for family at home
So I am like I would like to order some takeout, but I am scared, because we are still waiting for the order for here. The same girl asked what our order number was. then did back and forth with the kitchen, and started to speak in Arabic, but I could tell by the tone that this was going me make very annoyed, what she is about to tell me.
She did something with the order when she refunded me for the Bolani, and the Back 
( kitchen ) never prepared my order., the chit never printed or was not handed to the back.
Not a single apology!

I am beyond annoyed at this point, we were starving by then. At last one guy comes from the back sees our receipt, acknowledges that it has been way too long, my exact order was ready, but I guess it was for someone else, but he grabbed it from the girl's hand, & he is like ""start with this"".

Now a gentleman comes from behind, and asks if the order was his. The girl goes yes, go ahead, like whoa! Is she asleep? The chef just told me to start with this.
Now he is looking at me. Awkward as it can be, he is like is this your order? because he heard the whole conversation, I am like just take it. 

Then we waited for 15 more minutes, our food arrived with 2 comp puddings (that I could not careless about, but the pudding was damn good) 

NOTE TO THE OWNER: 
PLEASE TRAIN YOUR STAFF, also train them to apologize first and foremost, and then offer to comp the food, by giving pudding away without speaking to the customer does not solve anything. The girl at the counter had a horrible attitude, Nobody from the counter realized that a table was sitting and waiting without any food for 45 minutes?
Nobody cares? It boggles my mind!

 If you are not in the business to make your customers HAPPY, by compensating them for a blunder your staff made , at least APOLOGIES!!!  trust me it WORKS.

PS. I was not looking for free food, spent around $80 bucks or more ! it's the thought and correcting an error properly what counts.

Folks but there is hope for Afghani kabob in Mississauga, just do a search on yelp, and yes I am been to most of them

The restaurant is spacious with booths and family dining tables tastefully decorated in a hunting motif. The wooden tables and walls gives for a nice ambiance for good eatin'!
Like most bbq restaurants you have more options than you can choose from, for me it's always the 2 meat with 2 sides. It's necessary for me to always have one of the meat choices be ribs. I love ribs. Pork and beef alike, I don't discriminate when it comes to red meat. I am a believer.
The first thing to come to the table was their famous bread pudding.. As my boyfriend MUST always eat dessert first, I have the opportunity to know if I need to leave room for my own after dinner. The bread pudding is so good that he won't order any other option. The bowl it's served in could hold a King size portion of linguini pasta. The dessert itself is beautiful, the way it glistens it what looks like candied pecans and fun juice. Slipping down the side was a nice size scoop of old fashion vanilla ice cream; which you need. This dessert isn't for someone who can not appreciate sugar. It was pretty dang good, I could only handle a bite, but my photo will show you that was not the case for my boyfriend.
I ordered ribs and a hot link with a side of green beans (small bacon pieces thru out), spicy macaroni and cheese, then of course I paid the extra for the loaded baked potato. Because what's BBQ without a baked potato? It came with a delightfully sweet corn bread muffin and a thick slice of white bread.
Famous Dave's have a few sauce options on the table and they definitely have more variety then most. I tend to like the more spicy of the sauces. 
The ribs though... Wow.. I was very impressed by the cut of meat. It started a conversation, and a failed Google search attempt, to find out where they purchase their meat. That good. The rib was seasoned slightly leaving a ton of room for me to taste the beautiful taste of meat. It was thick and meaty.. It was purrfect.
I highly recommend Famous Dave's for a couple, group of friends, or family. You can't go wrong. It's good enough to keep the table quiet, while everyone licks and devours what fun deliciousness is in front of them.

Unfortunately since we made reservations too late, we couldn't get a table until 9:30 pm. Side note: More restaurants should allow online reservations. Finding a table was a breeze.

After enjoying a cocktail at Crudo, we arrived about 15 minutes early to Beckett's Table. Much to our surprise we were immediately sat. 

The inside of the restaurant is very chic & trendy, with low lighting and music playing at not too annoying of a volume. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend ordered Miss Katie's Pimm's Cup and I ordered a Flinn's Dilemma because well... it had both Jameson & Bushmill whiskeys. How can I pass that one up? Our cocktails were delicious although my boyfriend noted that mine tasted much better. It might just be a preference for whiskey over vodka though. :)

For an appetizer, we really wanted to try the fried deviled eggs. I love deviled eggs and was all about trying them fried. However, much to our chagrin they were sold out. Boo. We ordered Brussels sprouts instead. They were quite tasty, but could have been a little more caramelized? Despite my total hatred of mustard anything, the dressing was a nice addition. 

For our main course, my boyfriend ordered the short ribs and I ordered the butternut squash risotto. We both really enjoyed our meals. I love butternut squash anything so I'm easy to please in that area.

Love love love the financiers (those little almond French cake thingys) for snacking while you're waiting to be seated. It's both a blessing and a curse to have that available when you're waiting 20 or so minutes, but it sure made the wait time bearable and faster. Of course, the table bread they bring out after you wait for your food isn't too bad either. ;] So much carb yumminess before the main meal arrives!

We ordered the popular Poulet et des Gaufres (roasted chicken with bacon-chive waffle, maple syrup,Tahitian vanilla bean butter & sauce Chasseur at $26.50) and the Pain Perdu (brioche French toast with blueberry compote, served with vanilla bean butter & Crown maple syrup at $14). I liked the chicken and waffles more than the french toast, and the sauce definitely brings out the taste in both the chicken and waffles. BF loved that the chicken was lean and not full of fat. 

Bouchon is known for their baked goods, so we added a side order of chocolate croissant ($4.25). We ended up taking it to-go since we were too full from our meal to even try a bite. When I tried it later on that day, I felt a bit miffed that it wasn't anything special for the high price tag! Looked just like the chocolate croissant sold at the Bouchon Bakery on the casino floor of the Venetian and that one cost less too! It didn't taste fresh and flaky, as it would if it come just out of the oven. Baguette Cafe definitely has the better croissant.

So, in this instance, its you wouldn't know how good this place is until you've been somewhere where it's really not as good and then regret not going back here. 

Friends recommended this very clean and busy Chinese restaurant on Dundas just a block west of the AGO. I had heard that it was owned by the same company as Spring Rolls (the sign outside also uses the same font) but was told it isn't, which is a relief (street free would have been flushed right down the drain if it had been). The atmosphere is bright and comfortable . The clients are almost all Chinese which to me speaks to its authenticity. We ordered dumplings, beef ho fun, and actually...more dumplings! But the food was really good. Very tasty. The Ho Fun was excellent. The dumplings arrived with some vinaigrette to dip them in which did not disappoint. Service was quick. 

I'd have liked to try more of the menu, but my dinner group wasn't very hungry (save for me), so it had to wait for another day. Servings are a bit smaller than Spadina joints, but are still enough to keep you full.

Not overly sweet and you can really taste the distinct flavors! This yelp review is overdue as I've been to this bakery for quite a while.

Gemmes- their specialty! Like a decadent twix bar! First time I've tried it was during pregnancy before the actual bakery even opened! I called Tiffany and placed an order and we arranged pick up. First bite- ahhhh!!! Heaven! 2 years later- still the same exact amazing quality! 

Cupcakes- so fresh! Perfect flavor matching! So good! She sells out often but takes orders so it's best to call or place an order! Must try! 

Lemon bars- my fav!! I love tasting the real butter in the crust and the tart lemon flavor! 

The bakery offers deals and holiday specials often. Follow them on social media (Facebook etc). We did had Thanksgiving sweets (cornbread pies homemade caramel and fudge sauce) and it did not disappoint! For Easter my kids loved her perfectly decorated sugar cookies-tasted so good! You can def taste the real ingredients! 

On top of that the bakery is decorated so adorably. Photo op! My kids and I really enjoy being in the bakery and it's a great place for meeting up with friends too. Looking forward to many more visits!

It's very hit-or-miss...some dishes are spectacular and others are just mediocre. We started out with the fritto misto, some fried cheese and a variety of lightly fried vegetables. If only they were as lightly seasoned as they were fried, this would have been a great appetizer, but they were pretty over-salted. When the person brought it out, we asked if it came with any dipping sauce, to which she replied simply, ""No."" I guess that answered the question, but it would have been nice if she said, ""Not normally, but would you like some?"" Of our two pastas, one was okay and one was a knockout. The fetuccini dish with pesto, raisins, pine nuts, etc. was pretty bland. On the other hand, the orecchiette dish with sausage and greens was bursting with flavor. One thing I'll say about both dishes is that the pasta itself was perfectly cooked and tasted as homemade and wonderful as you'd expect at a place called PastaBAR...Wade Moises certainly has the Italian cuisine credentials and knows his pasta. And as for those who say the portions are too small, I say your stomachs are too big. It's one thing to note that the dishes are one the high end of the price spectrum, which they are, especially for lunch, but the portions are perfectly satisfactory. This is no Olive Garden - no endless pasta bowls here. We were both busting after our one appetizer and two pastas, and my one pasta alone could have filled me up. Of course, even though we were busting, we decided to try the light, refreshing peach/orange granita for dessert. Our server kindly brought out the cappuccino one, too, explaining, ""I brought the cappuccino granita, as well, because I think it's really the star of our granitas."" Man, was she right! While the peach/orange granita was refreshing, it was a little too tart and lacked the depth and richness of flavor that the cappuccino one had. So you can see that some dishes hover in mediocrity while others rise to perfection. Order carefully, as it will make or break your meal. I'd give the food 3.5 stars, taking into account both the mediocre and excellent dishes, but PastaBAR gets a 4 overall taking into account the friendly service and casually hip space.",2009-07-31 04:48:39

You should too.

This is actually a spacious SDM. The spacing between some of the displays on the second floor almost suggest that it's too spacious.

We got lucky on parking, but it's really the ONLY bad thing about this Midtown spot. View of downtown and the metro vibe, but not the crazy cluster-fudge that is downtown (or is it uptown?)

I had been urged by friends to try Dressler's for a while... Unfortunately the prices are a little high for my household's food game, but thank God for Groupons!! We had a $30 coupon for $60 worth of food, HOLLA!

Aside from the amazing food, the thing that stood out to us the most at Dressler's was the amazing service. Our waiter was so helpful, thoughtful, and fast. Just a shining star in a sea of mediocre waiters. Three thumbs up.

Now back to the food.. DELICIOUS. Really though, the quality of everything was super high and fresh. Our waiter even assured us that the seafood is flown in fresh daily. I didn't have the biggest selection as a vegetarian and I mentioned this to the server AFTER our meal. He felt so bad: ""I wish you would have let me know, we have an entire vegetarian menu and gluten-free menu"". Whoa! 

I ordered the Goat Cheese & Garlic Appetizer and G's House Salad as my entree. Both of these were simple but perfect. The Goat Cheese app was very similar to my favorite goat cheese app at 300 east. The one at Dressler's differs in that it's served with a tomato chutney instead of sun-dried tomatoes... I can dig it. I ate every single bite of both my plates.

My boyfriend ordered Just for the Halibut and was blown away. I rarely see him that blissful about food, but this was one of those times.

The atmosphere is casual and cozy, with rotating art on display, accommodating and warm staff, and spacious seating (also would be a good place to read a book or get some work done). I went on a weekday and it was busy, with lots of CAMH staff (CAMH is just across the street), art students (some from Max the Mutt animation school, next door), and such. 

I had the #21 sandwich: spinach, mushroom, avocado, and provolone melt on a baguette. Divine. Our waitress said that was the most popular veggie sandwich. My friend had the same thing, but they let her substitute roasted red peppers for the mushrooms. I added a premium salad for $4 and I thought it was worth it. It was a pretty big salad, with nice fresh toppings. I had the ""Verde"" which has asparagus, brie, and avocado.

I heard that SOHO made their mark with their infamous fried chicken so I had to try it! The chicken pieces are a la carte. You can get a chicken breast for $4.50, thigh $3.50, and it's even cheaper for the drumstick or wing! You have a choice of mild or spicy, and the side dishes are $3.50 (smoked Gouda mac n cheese, spicy collard greens, waffles, mashed potatoes and gravy and more!).

Now let's get to the meat of this review. The chicken was definitely finger lickin' good! I got the spicy chicken thigh. It was probably a little bit bigger than my fist when it arrived with a side of spicy collard greens. I instantly thought for sure there was a bone in it. As I cut into it and took my first bite, it was so juicy and flavorful! The breading was so delicious that I went in for the kill. I took my knife to it a few more times in search of the bone just to realize... There was no bone! OMG... This is just a big piece of perfectly fried delicious chicken! Wow... I'm speechless... Maybe it's because my mouth was completely stuffed with chicken and collard greens. But I devoured every piece, crumb and juice of it! Yum!!!

If this review was for the chicken, it would get 5 stars. However, the review is on the restaurant. Where they lost a star is the service. The service was slow... We waited over 20 minutes for the server to come back to our table to take our order, and it wasn't that busy in there like you might think! It also took the server awhile to come back to our table after we were all done eating to give us our checks. When she did finally give us our bill, she gave my friends another table's bill.

Gyro with French fries.
Very little meat inside pita bread, lots of iceberg lettuce with sauce, and french fries. It was tasty.
Tenderloin Chicken Shish kabob on the platter with saffron rice, garnished with onions and some green leafs and grilled tomatoes. Freshly made, chicken was very tender and tasty.

Different trails invite hikers, joggers, casual strollers, and people who want to take in the awe-inspiring vistas on their bikes or on horseback. There are trails of varying degrees of difficulty for hikers of different levels of fitness (and motivation). Examples of easy trails are the Lost Dog Wash Trail (round trip length, about 5 miles; maximum elevation difference, 380 ft.) and the Ringtail Trail (round trip length, about 4.5 miles; maximum elevation difference, 307 ft.) There are also moderate, difficult ... and very difficult trails, such as the Tom's Thumb Trail (round trip length, about 10 miles; maximum elevation difference, 1363 ft.)

In this preserve you'll also find a well-planned and very informative nature trail, guided hikes for almost every interest and hiking level, two distinct regions for mountain bikers, and equestrian staging areas. There is a spacious parking area next to the visitor center where you can get abundant information about the preserve. There are other parking areas as well along the boundary of the preserve.  You can use these if you want to hike certain trails such as the Lost Dog Wash Trail or the Sunrise Trail, but parking near the trailheads of these trails can be limited. 

The best way into the preserve is through the Gateway, which is at 18333 N. Thompson Peak Parkway (east side of Thompson Peak Parkway between Bell Road and Union Hills Drive). From the gate here, the road leads to the spacious parking lot and the visitor center, where you can get guide brochures and from which you can choose the trail for your hiking adventure, bike ride, or peaceful stroll while taking in the remarkable views.",2010-01-05 05:31:08

After all this is Phoenix, there has to be a good place right by me!

Finally, I was advised to go to Los Taquitos from a friend of mine saying they have BOMB carne asada so I had to go see for myself as Elliot Rd is down the street from me (YES!). When I entered this place, it felt like home as it reminded me of one of my favorite places I used to go to back in Cali. It's clean, the staff is very friendly and their salsa is awesome! I personally like the green over the the red but they're both good! You can choose a la carte or a meal plate and they have a breakfast menu to boot! Now was the carne asada BOMB? YES! The carne asada was to die for, it was juicy and cooked just right. The tacos are small-ish but hit the right spot without putting you in a food coma afterwards. I usually have 2 or 3 (if im starving) and I'm in heaven. I go here about once a week for the tacos and I am never dissapointed. The burritos are excellent as well and are medium in size, again they don't serve the super XXXL burritos here which is fine with me because I don't like the food baby feeling I get after eating one of those bad boys! Oh and I forgot to add that the tacos are CHEAP, $1.15 a piece. If you want a 3 tacos plate, its 6 bucks, comes with rice and beans. So for the south phoenix/ahwatukee/chandler peeps, I recommend this place, its delicious, cheap, and clean as well!",2010-04-25 18:43:57

Everyone who works at the office seems to enjoy their jobs and Dr  Fara has plenty to do with that. After removing the foot with friendly coaxing and the promise of a new toothbrush and floss followed by prescription strength mouthwash, I feel that my small-toothed mouth has some hope. I was walking around with pain in my lower left molar region, such pain that I honestly didn't want to open my mouth at all  Image Dental helped me get over it and fitted a temporary crown which I must have swallowed. Everyone at this office is there to help. I started here with Dr  Gno, and was concerned when he moved away. A temp dentist took over for 6 or 7 months and he and his sidekicks did a horrendous job with me. Dropping dental supplies down my throat, etc. Dr Tran and Dr. Fara turned it all around with truly terrific care, making billing more affordable, showing a personal touch with what we patients always crave. Disregard the less than stellar reviews. All who work there are professional, kind, and goal oriented. Thank you Image Dental.

I was warmly welcomed and was led to my table where my friend was waiting for me.  We decided to order the Lougheed Lunch - 3 course meal for $25: 
- soup/salad - opted for soup - I had the Portuguese Sausage soup with kale - so good and hearty!  My friend had the mushroom soup.  I had a taste of her soup and it was very creamy.
- main - we both had the ""braise"" of beef cheeks.  So delectable!  The meat is so tender you can cut with your fork!  Comes with garlic mashed potatoes and brocollini.  There is also a choice of fish if you feel like seafood.  The mains change every day.
- dessert - we both chose the Brownie - Mmmm, mmmm, good!  Came with white little flakes of meringue & caramel sauce.
- choice of coffee or handmade soda - we both chose sasparilla root beer.  The drink came In a tall glass, the liquid was translucent with a hint of brown at the bottom.  Give it a quick stir with your straw and you will quickly find that it quenchers your thirst

3xAwAW026GSiimDfCwpLsg,Y6rQQJiVHEn_SuScZzJSxg,FirWX-Ep5203TsdiGgShKg,4,9,5,5,"Go to the Vig Uptown for the bathrooms alone. Seriously. If you are one of those neurotic people out there like myself who judges establishments and the frequency of which you will attend them by the cleanliness among other features of their bathrooms, then I am thrilled to say you will not be disappointed. The stalls are gigantic, completely separated from top to bottom so you have full privacy and don't have to stare at people's disgusting dirty feet, and best of all, they have a little ledge for your cocktails! Why more places don't consider that sometimes we like to take our drinks to the bathroom with us is beyond me, but it creates a real predicament once you walk into a stall and there's nowhere to put it. Oh, and if I ever become rich I am ripping all of the sinks out of the bathrooms in my condo and replacing them with whoever's sinks are in the Vig. In a word, GORGEOUS!

The second thing that makes the new Vig a winner is the Kid's Menu portion of Mac n Cheese. It is so freaking delicious I have no words. Almost tastes like fresh pasta smothered in Velveeta. Plus it costs like $5, possibly $6, whatever, I've never once been able to finish it.

Drinks are a little pricey for me to spend as much time as I'd like here, especially with regard to their gorgeous bathrooms, but still affordable enough that I'll come party here once or twice a month.

I'm so glad Petra got the boot! That place sucked and kind of ruined my 19th birthday. Or was it my 20th? Oh well. Either way, I'm beyond elated that Hot Chef... I mean TOP CHEF ;) Angelo Sosa opened his restaurant here! With Honey Salt & Poppy Den in Summerhood, I kind of still wish I lived there. Actually, Its probably better that I don't. If I was still 5 minutes away from this joint I'd probably be here more often then I should.

SUNDAY BRUNCH: The only Korean fusion I find acceptable is at Poppy Den! Sosa has mastered Kim-Cheese, Kim-Hollandaise, Kim-Relish... With my name in all that,  its like it was meant for me to eat. *bad joke end* All *bad* jokes aside, it really is delicious. I probably looked a little ridiculous dunking everything I could into that Kim-Cheese but it was so delicious and very easy for my non-kimchi-eating friends to enjoy. I stole some bites from my friends' plates but my Eggs Benedict had to be my favorite. Hello polenta cake deliciousness. Other honorable mentions are the Pea Soup, chicken wings, and Yuzu Caesar Salad.

LVRW 2013: $30.13 three-course dinner? What a deal! After trying PD's pea soup & tomato soup, I have officially dubbed them the soup masters. The crab toast we got was tasty but what makes the dish is that mango mustard. If I order than again, I'm definitely asking for extra! The Roasted Duck Breast is such a cute dish in concept. Play on the sweet honey and add texture by throwing in Kix cereal. But to be frank, it was way too sweet for my taste and not enjoyable. They do however do a killer job on their Miso Salmon. One of the better salmon dishes I've had in Vegas (over many Strip places). Everyone has that friend that always orders salmon when they go out right? This is the place to take them for a delicious and perfectly-cooked salmon that won't bust the waist line!

DESSERT: Everyone goes nuts over the chips & ice cream.The ice cream is tasty and the chips have a homemade kettle chip quality.  Its good but not all that. Before I tried their Strawberry Shortcake, I remember Vanessa N. raving that she doesn't like most strawberry shortcakes but she loves the one at Poppy Den.The cake is soaked in sake and the whipped cream is infused with peppercorn.  I can confirm that it is the business.",2013-03-18 06:40:22

I went into the store and went to the men's wallet section and took out my passport and proceeded to try to line up the passport with large wallets. A store  employee attempted to help me and after a few minutes told me the one on line he had never seen in store. So I made my way to luggage to see if they had anything to work as the kiosk stated it was in that department. This area was a complete mess this area was dangerous. To walk without having to step over tattered and torn products and empty products boxes including shoes. I found One Samsonite passport wallet and made my way to the register. At check out that same employee asked me if I would empty my pockets because the area near luggage had shown several items that have been removed from their packages. Basically accusing me of stealing. He asked me to empty my contents of my pockets and this would be the easiest way for them to determine and not shoplifted the missing items from the luggage department. I asked him to call the police. I had emptied my pockets onto the counter at the register and when he could not find any items he asked me if he could look into my pockets. I asked him to call the police or I was and started to dial and manager came and she had no visible name tag and after complying with there demands. I asking to pay for my product and leave they wasted an hour. They offered me 10% off my purchases and their sincerest apologies for he was only doing his job. Security officer... The only reason I went to Khols is because I already had a ten percent off coupon that I received in the mail. The employees who makes minimum wage doing his job between his beard and body piercings in a large hoop earring. I never judge anyone by appearance but when I asked if he had seen me take anything. No was his answer the staff are at Kohl's are basically you get what you pay for minimum wage part-time highschooler's earning a living. The management not much better promoted high school students trying to make a living. Extremely humiliated. They never found anything in my pockets. And never call the cops. But made a spectacle out of me. Now I know why I always throw Kohls 10 to 50% off in the trash it's because that's where Kohls belongs.

I have never been to a Korean BBQ place before, and from what I heard from the girlfriend and many of my asian friends, this place was the place to be at.

When we walked in, it was fairly quiet. Many other patrons were quietly eating their food. It looked like Honey Pig was airing out the restaurant by opening all the doors and windows, and having the vents on full power. Honestly it sounded like a factory or something haha. No biggie though, I'm there for the nitrosamine foods, not the noise.

My girlfriend and I got the AYCE, which included several different meats. In my opinion, everything tasted great, but I especially enjoyed the bulgogi and the Sirloin. The Ribs were delicious as well! There was squid included, but honestly I don't like the texture of squid. My girlfriend said it was good though, so there's my review on that haha.

I was very impressed with the attentiveness of our waitress. She came by often to help us grill and also bring more meat out. Although there were times where she looked like she had too many people to manage, she never forgot any request that we had.

That cinnamon drink at the end tho!!! I think I wanted to take a gallon home! Haha! Overall this place was great for the price. Would I come back? Yeah probably... I hear there are many great Korean BBQ places in Vegas so maybe I'll check all of them out also.",2014-03-11 06:53:29

Wvrst is a bavarian style pub with long bench tables, tons of beer and a large selection of sausages that is definitely going to please the different preferences in your group of friends.

The sausages come in bun and currywvrst format.  I've never ordered the currywvrst, but it's supposed to be a plate of sausage covered in a curry sauce.

In terms of sausages, they have a ton.  Everything from your classic bratwursts and chorizo sausages to some different ones like boar and kangaroo.  It takes a couple trips back to Wvrst to actually try them all but it makes it easier if you decide to share.

I personally really like the boar sausage as well as the classic bratwurst. You can't really go wrong with these.  I've found that most of the fowl sausage a little dry, but I did like some of the other game sausages like the elk and the kangaroo.

In terms of beer, they have a bunch of german beers on tap as well as a bunch in bottles from around the world.  True to its bavarian roots, Wvrst serves beer in 1/2 litre steins as well.  They're quite large and heavy so you get a bonus bicep workout while drinking it.
