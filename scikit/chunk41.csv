Wisely went here before grocery shopping. To be fair, my review is only based on a very simple, standard two-egg/meat/potatoes breakfast. If you can screw that up (and many places can, oh yes) then I probably won't be back. I wasn't very hungry, so just got that so I'd - I mean my wallet - would be a bit safer as I walked through the valley of the Shadow of Whole Foods. 

Service was very good, prompt and balanced - by that I mean the waitress gave me privacy but didn't ignore me. I hate when wait staff is overly bothersome just as much as when they are negligent. I should say that the place was relatively deserted, so it's hard to judge what service might be like during a busier time. I will find out though, because after taking a look at the menu choices, I have every intention to go back, especially for the fish fry. 

My eggs were cooked to order. You might think, ""Eggs, so what? but if you've ever had a snotty over-easy egg or received an over-medium that was frisbee hard, you know. One thing I did think to share - my bacon had obviously been baked and retrieved from a pan somewhere. It was stiff as a board. I like crispy, almost over-done bacon - well okay, I like bacon of most any kind, so this was fine with me but some people wouldn't like it.The order came with potatoes, which I hadn't seen on the menu. I rarely eat them now but had a few bites for the sake of Yelp readers (see the sacrifices I make?). The potatoes were nothing to write home about, but they weren't bad. They seemed to have varied flavors... seasonings I presumed picked up from other foods cooked on the same flat top. 

I want to add too that the Yelp reviewer who said something about getting hand-foot-mouth disease was just rude to post that to a public review site such as this. HFM is a virus that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. It can also spread by contact with infected eh... well, I'll say diaper contents to keep it polite. Now I suppose that doesn't rule out getting it at this or any other restaurant, but given that the child mentioned is 14 months old, it seems more likely that it could have been something gotten through another route. At any rate to indicate that there's very little possibility of it being contracted anywhere else than this restaurant is not only rude but potential defamation. If it's a true concern, that's a matter for the health department to investigate. 

Carry on, Yelpers.",2015-10-11 01:25:06

I ate the same amount that I normally eat at Zoyo and was left feeling unsatisfied. I think it has to do with the fact that a lot of their flavors are low-fat and the yogurt is made from powder. It's a shame, because they have some really awesome flavors. They just don't taste that great and aren't satisfying.",2011-09-02 23:39:48

It has all the essentials for a downtown mall: grocery store, food court, pharmacy, movie theatre, gym, Indigo, Starbucks.  

Nothing special, but it's connected to the subway, so that's a plus. In addition, the food court has recently added Freshii (well used to be upstairs) and Sushi shop.  

The mall is currently under massive renovation, so hopefully they will add more stuff.  

Biggest upside is that it's connected to the subway. Biggest downside is that my employees keep slacking off and seeing movies whenever they work from this office since it's connected (kidding).",2013-09-19 22:38:36

I absolutely love the spicy wings but the soy garlic wings are also very good.  I like to order them with their Dirty Rice which is perfection.  That said, their fish tacos are my favorite item on the menu.  If you go, try everything to learn your personal favorite.  My friends and I go and we all love something different but enjoy everything.  They have a very chill vibe and some tasty beers on the menu.  They are good for eating outside and are pet friendly if you'd like to sit outside with your fury friend.  They do play sports and you can watch both professional and college football.  I 100% recommend, they have something there for everyone.",2017-09-02 15:01:43

First off, I booked our reservation through the yelp app and when we got there they couldn't find it. When booking, I received a text msg with all of the details so I showed that to the hostess and they honored the reservation. I was a little bummed because I made a note online that we were celebrating my husbands birthday and I guess they didn't see that either so nothing was done. The restaurant itself is pretty, and the live music is a nice touch. The service was also pretty good, but the food was only so-so. My husband had the filet and he said it didn't have much flavor. He said the same about the roasted potatoes it was served with. I had the seafood pappardelle. There was a good amount of lobster and scallops but my lobster was over cooked and the pasta was a bit chewy. The sauce and scallops were good but again, nothing spectacular. We also had 2 cocktails that were very sweet. It wasn't a horrible experience but it also wasn't memorable. I'd much rather go to Del Frisco's for steak or Giada's for Italian.",2015-09-08 06:24:56

They had plenty of activities outside for kids and adults. The vendors are plentiful. The scoreboard and tv screens are keeping up with the times. The have plenty of people coming into the stands selling beer and water which helped on a hot day. The bathrooms were clean and in close proximity. We parked near the casino and walked over. It wasn't a bad haul considering everyone around us was doing the same. Plenty of security and ticket takers so the lines were long but moved. I would come back and watch another game.

The service was impressive. I'm pretty sure the waiter thought I was going to be high maintenance because as soon as he brought my Diet Coke in a short tumbler I stopped him before he left and said, ""Just so you know, I drink like a fish. Do you have any larger glasses to save you some trips?"" He said they didn't, but that he'd bring me two smaller glasses at a time. He kept up with me and the litter of tumblers that accrued over the course of our meal. I can't imagine though, why they insist on serving sodas in tiny little tumbler glasses.

The food was good. I ordered the chopped chef salad with chicken. The menu said it came with avocado, but it did not. Still, it was quite tasty.

The bill for 1 beer, my soda, 1 app and 2 dinner salads came out to roughly $45. Decent, although a little pricey for lunch. Good restaurant, we'll visit again I'm sure.",2013-12-16 15:39:37

WTpiZWszZJoHJUABERALjQ,3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,3,17,9,14,"So.....the 5 star average for yet another Mexican Restaurant kinda fooled me again, leaving me with an A-OK visit....What I've noticed so far is that Eastside eateries are hit and miss.

This is a very spacious spot with very friendly service, but we came for what they are supposedly known for...their Enchiladas. About 14-15 different sauces to choose from, all made from scratch, and the tortillas here are made from scratch and not out of a bag....prices are $9.95(cheese), $11.95 (chicken), and $12.95 (beef) and come with four to an order(folded over taco style, not rolled) You also get rice, chips and salsa, beans(made with lard), greens, and Sopa de Fideos. Very plentiful and filling as well. For those who can't decide on what sauces you want on your enchiladas, you can do 50/50, with two different sauces which is what we did. I saw on the menu that you can also customize your plate for $10.95. We shared the Guajillo, Mole(with chicken) Encacajuatadas (Japanese Peanut and chili sauce) and Pipian (Pumpkin Seed sauce) Enchiladas.

For me, the flavors of the sauces were good,(chicken was minimal and bland) but my main issue was that both plates were room temperature to cold (the soup was even warmer) Common sense is that hot food is served hot, cold food served cold, nothing in between. Also, for those of you who are used to cheddar or monterey jack in your enchiladas, Queso fresco, a soft crumbly cheese is used for everything. You won't get that ooey gooey cheesiness here. 

The whole back of the menu is non-enchilada items FYI, and they no longer do AYCE enchiladas on Sunday...It's only on Wednesdays after 4pm...I'm glad we at least got to try it out, but are in no such hurry to return. ALOHA!!!

This is a very historical city, as it was created specifically for the workers building Hoover Dam. At least that's what I heard.

Got there on a Friday morning and sat on a bar stool. Lots of locals. Waitresses were very nice and tended to me immediately.  I ordered a Cali Omelette.  Filled with the usual items in this type of omelette, various veggies.  It was okay, nothing special.  Typical of a veggie omelette.  Not sure what I was expecting, but I could get this anywhere. Potatoes were pretty good.
What I really liked was the ambiance of the place, with lots of various items covering the walls and ceiling.  License plates, surf boards, etc.  Great place visually.

I work in an area where within 5 minutes all the major coffees shops are available to me: and until today I have been rotating between my 3 regular/brands for their ""specialties"" that appeals to me: Timmies for their Steeped tea; Starbucks for Chai latte; and Second Cup for whatever strikes my fancy. Sometimes, I even visit Timothy's on my very lazy days.

Today was brutally cold and I happened to get to work by Queen street and not my regular route via King street; devastated by the distance I needed to walk for my daily java - I was just about to have a fit - until I saw the magical words: Little Nicky's Coffee.

Now I'm a latte person - I'm not sure why, but coffee rarely strikes my fancy any more (possibly because I worked at 2/3 major brands?) - but this little place didn't strike me as having latte- and really, when I opened my mouth to ask, the words that came out were, ""May I have your largest cup of coffee with whatever THAT is?""

I got to the office satisfied. When I sat down and took a sip I was grateful for my ""keen"" observational skills...and in awe of the flavourful liquid in my hand  - with my second sip I took a bite out of their banana muffin(wee little thing it was too) which melted away in my mouth and was gone way too quick.

Maybe it seemed so good because was so devastated seconds before getting it - but I tell ya, the 2nd and 3rd cup of coffee I had throughout the day - was just as delightful. It's a gem - and best of all it's close - so yes, I am now a fan.",2011-02-01 05:30:43
QFWOGgydr_Bnqyt2sdD8Pg,Vwhs9b2Cs-QbD-cli2YCCA,ePjHWTk1AzpYbuh4lFzhxg,4,0,0,0,"The Vegetarian Combo Platter, from the appetizer menu, included the best FALAFAL I've ever had. It was lovely and moist inside, crispy outside. I have always sort of liked Falafal, but I didn't even know it could be that good. And I would be really torn to have to chose a favorite between the eggplant thing (ZAALUK) and the tomato and roasted red pepper thing (SHASHUKA). They were divine! 4th on the Platter was the Hummus which was a little different somehow, but also excellent.

My husband also ordered the Poutine (if you love gravy on french fries, this is the best you'll find).

I ordered the Beef Tajine (with Prunes) and it was lovely but not the best choice for me because I'm sensitive to onion and although onion isn't listed on the menu it's a MAJOR player in this dish.

My husband ordered the Lamb Chops which were absolutely perfect! These little meat gems are easy to dry out, but they were spot-on.

Then we splurged for dessert and sadly they didn't have any gelato that night, but we ordered the Marinasmir - which was a combination I would never have imagined, but it worked pretty well.

Our waiter was right there with information when we needed it, and described things well. Unfortunately, I didn't ask him about my dish before I experienced the onions, but that's my bad.

I was in town at Cedar point and had a day to explore Cleveland. This was one of my spots to hit up and on my visit list.

There is a small parking lot on the side of it which should be adequate because your normally in and out of the place quickly.

 We got there a little bit after 12 but the selections was very slim already. I was kinda of bummed because the person at the counter said that the day before, there was way more choices and had tons of extra during closing time.

The choices we got was a blueberry glazed, maple one, raspberry jelly, and one where they put a chocolate dollop on, i forgot which one was that.

When they say each batch is made from scratch, they are not kidding. Most of these donut places taste pretty much the same, but Jack Frost donuts was not. They actually tasted like from scratch Me being a scratch baker, you can taste the difference from scratch and when its just a mix. All of the choices I got were very wonderful. The one I liked the most is the one with the chocolate dollop.

There was a older gentlemen with a veteran hat which I think was maybe the owner? He noticed I was from NY because of my license plate on my car, and asked how did I find out about them, and I told them Yelp.

While it filled my belly, my latest experience reminded me why I haven't eaten here since 2010. In a town with so many great Mexican food options, I can't understand why anybody would choose to dine here. I know, lots of you probably have coupons, comps, etc., but I don't think I'd come back to eat here even for free. 

The dining room itself is nice and open with fun decor. The atmosphere is lively and fine (and it's NOT smoky although it's inside Sunset Station and right off the casino floor). The hostess was friendly and we were seated quickly. 

The service was fine but not great. It took a long time to be greeted at the table by our server but the busboy brought over some chips, salsa and bean dip (all just okay). Our waiter was super-heavily cologned. I don't mean he was wearing cologne, I mean he was doused up so heavily that when he dropped off our drinks, you could smell his cologne on our glasses! Whenever he came over to check on us, his smell lingered on far after he had vacated our area. He smelled nice but whoa, did he spill the entire bottle of Axe Body Spray on himself? Yikes!

The star of the show here is the salsa bar. There's a large bar with chips, bean dip, and lots of different salsas. You can help yourself to anything up there, so if you are like me and NEVER seem to have enough pico de gallo with your meal, you'll be a happy camper. I loaded plate after plate with heaping mounds of pico and it was awesome. Some of the salsas are pretty good, I'll give them that. But a salsa bar can't save this place.

We ordered the queso dip, steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas. The queso arrived first. It was in a big bowl (huge portion) but something wasn't quite ""right"" about it. It wasn't a large bowl of melty real cheese, and it wasn't even melted Velveeta. It had an almost powdered milk taste and consistency. It was one of the worst ""queso"" dips I have ever had. It was just plain nasty. I can't figure out what the heck was in it but it was maybe 1% cheese. I eat queso at every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to and this stuff was awful. Skip it. 

Next up came our fajitas. We had asked for a side of vegetables instead of the rice and beans. It's nice that you can sub the veggies with no additional charge, but the veggies were a complete afterthought. I was hoping for some nice peppers and zucchini, but what we got was basically a glorified plate of canned corn. Yuck. The fajitas were fine but the meat wasn't properly seasoned. The vegetables were cooked well but tasted mostly of salt. The prices were ridiculous considering the miniscule portions (my fajitas had 8 small shrimp for $15.99). A plus side for low carb diners is that the menu even states that you can get lettuce cups instead of tortillas with your fajitas and tacos, so score a star for that!  

I'm just not a fan of this place.",2015-02-26 18:23:59

There are a lot of restaurants popping up in Charlotte recently will a higher price point, and have left me thinking that the dollar amount is too high for the food and experience. 

This isn't the case for Cowfish, while you're looking at 12-20 bucks for a sushi roll, I was happy with my meal and the price... Every time I've gone cheap on sushi it's left me disappointed. Expect to wait, anytime you come here. Usually 20 minutes on average, when you go on a week night or Sunday. On a nice night, you can grab a bench outside.

Col and I order the R&R, Dion and the BBQ/Burger roll. Everything was delicious and we had a TON of food. I would say, I like the normal sushi more, but the BBQ was good, just not what I was in the mood to eat. The rolls are large so, I think one person could actually be content with one roll.

I ordered take-out from here last night and had the sushi dinner, which came with a miso soup and salad. The miso soup was quite salty, with quite a heavy punch of MSG compared to other restaurants. The salad is quite good though, and the sauce was put separate (at least for take out), so you can add as much (or as little) as you want.

The sushi itself I found to be quite fresh and I overall enjoyed it, however it definitely lost marks for fish variety. Out of the 12 pieces of sushi, 5 of them were salmon. I understand salmon is the staple of sushi and sashimi, but 5 pieces are quite overkill. There was only one piece of tuna, butterfish, albacore tuna, surf clam, to name a few. I would've definitely liked it more if more variety was possible, however they charge extras if you want to switch up the fish choices.

For $14.99, it's a good restaurant if you're into the ""lay it down, basic a la carte"" style of sushi. If you want more exotic and variety of sashimi grade fish, however, I suggest Toro Sushi over this.

EXCEPT...Lee's! It was the only place that was open in its strip mall / plaza, so we walked in and purchased some sandwiches to go. :) It was a good stop for us, since we were going to drive to Grand Canyon the next day, so buying some sandwiches for the road made sense.

We ordered:
Combination - yummy, 2 types of meat slices
Pork roll & pate - I'm a fan of pate, so I really liked this sandwich the best
Grilled pork - reddish color pork slices
Special combination - 3 types of meat, instead of 2 types in the regular combination
Roast beef - ""american style"" roast beef sandwich; my husband ordered this one

Every sandwich comes with some fermented/preserved orange/white carrots + some cilantro and slices of jalapeño. YUM! :)

There was a promotion at the time too: 
Buy 5, get 1 FREE! We took advantage of that - the cash register lady told us about it when we were ordering.

I was super excited to come here because the reviews looked awesome. We came for dinner and were immediately seated. Our waitress comes over and literally doesn't even look at us, she is looking off into the distance asking us what we wanted. I asked if I could get the mixed chicken and lamb gyro and she responds with ""No chicken."" Okay, thats fine...I get the lamb gyro instead. I don't think she said anything else to us. We get our food and I think it was just sitting in the back for awhile. The meat wasn't even that warm, lukewarm would probably be a good description for it. My boyfriend got the mix shish and adana kebab. He also said his food was kind of lukewarm in temperature. 

Okay...I'm super hungry so I start eating and about halfway through I started to feel nauseous. Usually I have a stomach of steel, I swear, but this made me feel sick. I ate about half of it and couldn't finish because I felt sick. At this point, I also wanted a napkin but our waitress was nowhere to be found? I saw her put her jacket on and disappear for awhile so another girl came over. She was very sweet, as was the other waitress who came over and gave us a napkin. 

We asked for boxes and the check, and I see that our original waitress is back and taking an order from another table. One of the nice waitresses came over and had to give us the boxes and checks. I felt bad because I wanted to tip well for the nice waitresses but since we weren't their table I wasn't sure if they would get the tip. Our original waitress never returned to our table, by the way. 

I'm just very disappointed because I wanted to enjoy the food here and I did not want to get sick. I basically paid $27 to be ignored by our original waitress and have food that made me feel unwell.

We both ordered off their lunch special menu and shared. We got Shanghai noodles with chicken, and sweet and sour chicken balls. Both were really tasty! And with both dishes I was impressed with the amount of chicken we got. The Shanghai noodles dish was loaded with it, and the chicken balls were actually full of chicken instead of a little bit of chicken surrounded by a ton of batter like some places seem to do. 
The price was also amazing. $6.85 per dish, and that included a drink.
The only reason this is a 4 star review instead of a 5 star, is the service. I'll clarify though: the staff themselves were actually great. We were seated right away, brought menus immediately, and had our orders in and got our food in a timely manner. Well, sort of. I was brought Shanghai noodles with shrimp instead of chicken first, and asked if this was okay, as it was close. I like both, so I said it was absolutely fine, but before I could get a fork into it, they took it away, and two of the waiters had a little argument in Chinese about it.

The fries were average but the onion rings are an issue. They use full onion slices so they are very large with limited breading. Vastly undercooked and soggy. They need more breading and longer fry time to add some crunchiness.

Upon getting to the room they had left us a gift of bubbly and cupcakes and a hand-written card welcoming us and wishing us a happy anniversary.  What a special touch.  Every staff member was very friendly.
The room was clean and definitely more like a boutique hotel room than a traditional hotel room.  Lots of fun colors and furnishings.  The bathroom was spacious, clean and had everything we needed.  
The only thing that stood out that I did not like was the speed of the elevators.  It was kind of ridiculous how slow they were- whether you were on them or waiting for them, i could be frustrating.

I spoke to Paymon for about five minutes explaining to him my admiration for his first lounge that I frequent on Maryland & Flamingo.  I also told him I was impressed being my first visit at his newest establishment.  Paymon couldn't be a more pleasant host/owner to talk to.

The food deserves 3 stars overall, but the pepper tofu is so out of this world delicious that I'm willing to bump them up to 4. As a vegetarian in Phoenix, I'm always starved for entree options, and I wish there were more dishes like this. I got this dish to go while I waited for my car to be serviced nearby, and a couple employees walked by to tell me how good my lunch smelled. I asked for it extra spicy, and the extra jalapenos added just enough heat.

I came back again with my husband to try some of their veggie pho, and I was disappointed. It was good but nothing special. My husband felt the same way about his beefy pho. We shared a plate of spring rolls, and they were so bland. Even the peanut dipping sauce had very little flavor.

So the parking lot was pretty full, which made us hesitate, because basically except for Black Mountain Tavern and a couple of salon, this little strip mall is Death Valley.  So, figuring everyone was at BMT, we almost turned away because we didn't want to wait or deal with a crowd.

Thank goodness we didn't.  There was plenty of room!  Despite lots of patrons, we got seated quickly.  Tables have a nice distance between and chairs are comfortable.  Atmosphere is nice---not cozy, like the word ""tavern"" makes me think ""cozy""---it's kind of minimalist and rustic-industrial.  But very attractive.  Hostess pleasant, our server was cheery and attentive.

To begin, we each got a glass of wine.  About average pricing, fair pour.  Then we started off with each of us getting a house salad---DH got the Prickly Pear vinaigrette and I got the chipotle ranch.  Dressings good and veggies fresh, but the presentation was not so good.  It was in a pretty white bowl, but it was higher than wider.  It meant if you dug in to get lots of good bits in a bite, salad went all over the table-top.  You know, there's a reason most restaurants serve a salad in a wide, shallow bowl or  a plate.  So that was a ding.

Next ding: we got two bites of salad and our entrees arrived.  Not good. I know it's not fine dining, but I like to eat my food in order.  Now we are having to deal with the stupid salad bowls, two large plates of food, two glasses of wine, two glasses of water...  Anyway, that was annoying. 

However...really generous amount of food---we each ended up bringing home enough for lunch the next day and priced very respectably.  So what was the food like?  I got the Baja fish tacos.  They were pretty good.  Nothing special.  I think I would have liked maybe some feta cheese on them---maybe a touch of vinegar or something that added some brightness.  But they were good.  DH got the Sonoran chicken.  He took one bite and said ""off the chart""!  I tried it.  He was right.  Super good!  Chicken nicely cooked, moist but not slimy, slathered with this delish chile verde sauce---I totally know what I will get next time.  This was a really tasty meal and it's nice to have a local option that is casual and doesn't break the bank.

Just a personal preference, but I prefer it sweeter. Fans of the sassy vinegar bbq will probably love it. I love that the fried okra was a bit spicy; nice touch. Next time I will request it extra crispy. The bits that were a bit burned tasted heavenly. Cornbread was perfectly sweet, fluffy, moist and corny.

Their Japanese smoked eggplant has bold flavours and has just exact spices that it needs - it is well decorated by micro greens and pomegranate (which really went well with the main)

Coming to the desserts - I have had churros before and just because this is a a vegan place, I ordered Triple Chocolate Mousse which was delicious - every spoon just melts in your mouth!

Went with the French Quarter with extra shrimp, and for $13 you would expect at least mid sized shrimp, not the baby shrimp that it comes with, also coming in a to go container that Whole Foods uses.  It was pretty bland, not terrible, however the uncooked red onion was a bit overpowering.  I would certainly never want to eat this again, and could make the same thing with better shrimp for half the price.  Medium sized shrimp on the high side are $8.

We started with a large meze tabagi appetizer.  The bread that came with the dips was very soft and warm.  I was sure they made the bread in house.  The 4 dips were all stars in their own right.  They were chicken peas hummus, minty walnut spread (our favourite), domates ezmesi which was similar to a spicy and well grounded salsa, and eggplant patlican salata.  

For entrees, we ordered the Mixed Grills and the Anatolia Mixed Plate, both of which served meat kebabs.  While Greek kebabs were solid meat chunks on sticks, Turkish kebabs, or at least the Anatolia version of kebabs, are small chunks of grounded lean meat on sticks.  The result was well marinated and tender meat chunks on sticks.  Each type of meat (chicken, beef, lamb) was marinated with special sauce and herbs, had individual personality, and no one really outshone the other.  Some might find the kebabs on the salty side; they were delicious nevertheless.  Both entrees came with salad and rice.

Our service was adequate. She served us in a nice and timely manner but nothing outstanding. We each tried something different; I chose the teriyaki chicken rice bowl and was sooo tempted to get the takkoyaki but I resisted because I wanted ice cream after. The bowl was $8.50. While the food was good, my complaint is that the portion was very very small. At a restaurant you never want to think ""I could have made this at home for cheaper"" but I thought that. It was not enough for this hungry soul. 

I also tried out the D4 ice cream which the name has escaped my mind, but I actually really enjoyed it. I got the twist of matcha and taro ice cream and it came with a kit Kat, tapioca, the bubbles that pop in your mouth, a few marshmallows, and etc. The taro is very smooth and I really liked it.

They have beautiful booths that let you settle in and relax. Their staff? fantastic! really nice and really fast with drink orders. It isn't the biggest place on state but it has an awesome relaxing feel. It is one of those places to grab an afterwork drink with friends and co-workers! Their beers are crafted expertly yet they aren't too expensive!,2011-05-04 22:37:52

Finally stopped in for takeout and was impressed with the quality and selection of dishes. Cafeteria-style ready-made dishes available as well as a large menu for fresh-made food, takeout is their specialty but they do have a few tables to dine-in as well.

SALT AND PEPPER PORK CHOP: Gigantic portion, flavorful and good quality cuts of pork. Wish there were a bit more peppers and onions for added flavor.
SINGAPORE NOODLE: This is more or less a combination pan fried noodle dish with veggies, chicken, bbq pork, and shrimp, along with tons of veggies and noodles. Portion size can easily feed two.
BOKCHOY AND BLACK MUSHROOM: Simple but good, generous portion.
BEEF & PORK SHUMAI: Better than expected, and much larger than other versions elsewhere at dim sum specialty places. Bit less flavorful than expected but still better quality than most would associate with the location appearance.

Most dishes are a flat $9, their ready-made combination meals are also really affordable. Service is polite and prompt, if the order takes a bit longer than expected they may tuck in a few Hong Kong donuts in your order gratis.",2015-04-06 15:31:09

Had I already reviewed this place, this would be an updated review.  unfortunately today's shopping experience wasn't quite pleasant due to the fact that most racks were a mess! The ones that front the store were nice and orderly as it was the new merchandise. once you go further in though, shopper beware! it was like shopping at a Ross or TJMAXX . It was hard to find things, and the more I looked, the more sad it became. The fitness and children's department looked orderly though. I did not go through Men's or Plus size.

when I was checking out with the very few items I got, I was asked by the cashier if I found everything okay. I replied that it was hard to find anything because of the messy racks, and I'd never seen it in such a condition before. he apologized and said they were short staffed. (there was a hiring job fair posted at register) I'm not sure that that's quite the problem. I saw quite a lot of associates on the floor which surprised me, cause sometimes when  you need them, nowhere to be found!  they weren't particularly working the racks, so I'm not sure what they were doing, couple had shopping bags to hand to shoppers, but I wasn't offered one, because my hands weren't full? hehe....what I think is partially the problem, is whoever is working the dressing rooms and put the clothes back on the floor is just dumping them on the first rack. I've seen associates before actually look for the right rack to put the clothing back,so it's been done before. There were so many clothes on the racks that it was hard to look through and they kept falling off, I was picking up half the time! Associates need to work in sections to sort the styles and sizes. I'm sure once they get familiar they will know where what goes. these days you rarely see the same associates in this type of store anyway. 

maybe I just hit this store on bad week, I'm not sure, but I will see what happens next time...I'm giving a 5 star anyway,because that's what they would have gotten on my original review, because I LOVE shopping here , its one of the bigger ones I've been to and I could spend a couple hours! I just can't stand shopping in a messy store....I'm hoping next time will be better!

Update...had to go back and change a size...WOW what a difference overnight makes, and I hardly think it was my review!p It's like I walked into a completely different store. Everything organized , greeting at the door and offer of a shopping bag, plus the associate was happy to help me find the right size because they had moved things around.

Neat subtly communist decor in a very large restaurant. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and got right into the bar. Lots of TVs with sports, and bizarrely clustered taps. They have a spectacular selection of beer; including their own which is usually quite good. They have several different samplers, including one with enough sizable samples to tranquilize Nancy Grace during a double murder trial. And they really mean full bar. In fact, they mean full everything.

The secret of BJs is it's menu; everything is really pretty good, and that's a feat because they have a huge diversity of entrees. If you have that friend in your group who has specialized diet concerns and can only eat blue foods from islands that don't feature indigenous amphibians BJs can feed them. BJs is great for large groups for exactly that reason: everyone gets what they want. No matter how stupid it is.

I found this hotel online, and the pictures and reviews made it my first hotel choice. I choose to stay in a Penthouse city view, with 3 of my party attenders. 

If you reserve a penthouse they have limo pick you up from the airport and drop you off at the for no additional charge. Our limo driver was very friendly! One of my friend's flights were delayed by a few moments, but he called to verify he could wait and was very pleasant. If you stay in the penthouse or sky suites section of the hotel, you get to enter into a VIP entrance. The check in was very speedy and the concierge was very friendly! The hotel also helped get access to the night club Haze. Since we were delayed arriving, they let the promoter know to assist us with entering the club past the cutoff time. 

When I got to the room I could not believe the beautiful view of the city! I could see where Las Vegas ended and the mountains and dessert began. There were sheer curtains and dark curtains in the room, and their are buttons to open and close them and to turn the lights on and off. We had one and half bathrooms which was very convenient for the four people in my room. The full bathroom toilet heated up and was sooo amazing. The shower could be a sauna, and you could sit if you like. The view from the bathroom was amazing as well!

The hotel has an amazing lay out. I wasn't to fond of club Haze but the GOLD LOUNGE was AMAZING and a nice atmosphere if you like little smaller crowds, easy access to the bar, and GREAT DJ. I clubbed at the Gold lounge every night. I didn't gamble, but the casino didn't smell too bad of smoke, and the layout was nice. 


The hotel is like another reviewer said ""SMACK DAB in the center"" of the strip. There is also a CVS less than 5 mins away from the front entrance of the hotel. The pool area and gym was simply amazing! 

Also, my friends accidentally moved a food item off a censor in my room, but we did not eat it. I called the concierge, and the made sure i was not charged for the item. Everyone in the hotel was just so helpful and friendly! My friends thought the hotel rate was a little costly, but after our weekend stay they agreed it was WELL WORTH IT!

Here are some of the pros/cons of what I experienced as a first time customer.  Hopefully they're still just working out the kinks of being a new restaurant.

The Pros
- The vibe - Fun relaxed atmosphere, it's definitely a place you wanna stop and get margs with friends
- The location - Right on Ellsworth Ave. in Shadyside, walkable from other restaurants and bars (good people watching from the outdoor seating)
-Po Boy Taco - pretty yummy, the garlic pickles and remoulade sauce made this taco!
-Management was receptive to my complaint.

The Cons
-Chips and Salsa aren't free (they're only $2.81 so not a huge deal)
-Hotlicks Red Salsa - tasted like a vegetable puree without much flavor...wouldn't order again
-Picnic Taco - Basically like biting into a water balloon filled with salt water! I could not take more than two bites because all I could taste was a salt explosion! Apparently multiple people complained about the saltiness the night I was there, so maybe it was just a bad batch?
-Service - The waitress was nice, however she wasn't very attentive.  She did not check back on the table after we got our food.  I sat for 20 minutes waiting to tell her about my taco and she never came back.  I eventually went in and talked to a manager about it, because it was taking so long.  The manager took the price of the taco off of the bill which I appreciated.'

So RCK does small pita sandwiches with different fillings and different styles/flavours. You choose your protein, and then your flavour profile (Egyptian, Greek, Lebanese, among others). My favourite is the Lebanese (garlic sauce and pickles) with halloumi cheese. They grill it on the flat top which makes it crispy and warm. Yum! I haven't tried their fries but I've had the Moroccan salad, and I didn't like it very much...Maybe it was just my palate and that's how it's supposed to taste, but it simply didn't taste right. It was too tangy and the seasoning seemed off; unbalanced, although it was filled with really good stuff like chickpeas and couscous. That was a thumbs down for me. Portions are pretty small which are perfect for me but someone else may need 2 pitas to be satisfied. 

The food is a definite 4-star but something about the place makes me uneasy. Service has been pretty spotty as other people have mentioned, and I never really feel welcomed into the place. Staff behind the counter always seem a little bored or resentful to be there and take my order almost scathingly. And now that someone has mentioned it, I have encountered the owner more than once and she never seems like a happy person... Kinda brings the place down. I think the vibe and the attitude of the place needs some work. 

Overall, it's a nice place to stop in for a quick bite but sometimes I'm a little put off by the atmosphere.",2014-08-29 04:22:57

Shrimp tempura is really as adventurous as I get. I get it, that's the cheese pizza of the sushi world. I don't give a damn, it's delicious. And my favorite shrimp tempura roll comes from Arashi. 

As another review mentioned, the sushi here is appropriately sized, which I appreciate. I'm not sure what's with the whole jumbo sized sushi burrito trend, but it's certainly not how sushi is intended to be served and Arashi respects that. 

As far as actual hibachi goes, I'm not that crazy about the cuisine that it's something I frequent - but that being said when it's my choice to pick a hibachi restaurant 100% of the time I'll pick Arashi. The first time I dined here was years ago with my grandmother and I remembered it being a really enjoyable time. We recently went here again for my husband's work party, and it was seriously a blast. Our chef was outrageously funny and kept us laughing and impressed the entire time.

I've never had anything but a positive experience here, whether it be dining in or picking up take out. Dining at Arashi is always a pleasure!",2016-04-28 13:17:35

However my family does prefer thin crust pizza. If you are a Chicago style pizza lover, this may not be the pizza for you. 
We always get our pizza with pepperoni, garlic and onions and then ask for it  well done. We usually order one to eat there and one to take home, because it's just as good, if not better leftover the next day! 
The outside patio seating is great for the kids and so is the pizza dough that they bring out for them to play with. 
We have done many family birthdays here with quite a few people, and every time, even though they don't always have a lot of floor space for all of the people that we bring in, they are always accommodating. (The Eastern and Serene location has a separate room for larger parties, which is easier. ) 

Despite another review below,  your pizza does include cheese in the base price. They only charge for cheese if you are ordering extra cheese. Also, ricotta cheese is not the standard cheese that your pizza comes with, that is an extra topping that you can order. They use fresh mozzarella on their pizzas.

Honestly, these other reviewers are on some heavy nonsense. 

Went here on 9/9/16 (Friday night around 8:45 pm) after having a 90 min + wait at Tofu Hut, Magal, Gen etc. I called Korean Garden and asked what their wait time was. It was no wait and starts at $16.95 for dinner. I was sold.

Walked in. Pretty basic looking, looks decent. While the menu is smaller than other places, I thought it was great that the cheapest option doesn't include seafood. We don't eat seafood, so why pay extra for dishes we weren't going to order anyway? Anywhere we go, we get brisket, pork belly and whatever is available that is marinated. Bulgogi is on the $20 menu, so we stuck with marinated pork. We also got steamed eggs which came out fast!

Service was fine. They kept the food coming and changed the grills out quickly, without us asking. At more expensive places, we've asked for various items multiple times, with the waiters forgetting. We didn't experience that at Korean Garden.

Before we had even been seated, I was planning to bring friends and family from all over to this spot just because of the atmosphere.

I went for a Thursday lunch with my man. We were seated quickly after choosing to stay inside rather than outside; it was a particularly windy afternoon. We were seated right next to an open window. Normally I'd be happy with the combination of indoor and outdoor seating, but the leaves blowing in the window and into my face ruined some of the whimsy.

Our server arrived shortly, introduced himself, and walked us through the menu. Everything was pretty self-explanatory. We placed our order -- pork belly and sausage with a potato spiral and sriracha cracklins -- and excitedly waited for it to arrive.

I really like that they serve you on a tray for easy sharing. Everything we ordered was tasty, but for me, the cracklins stood head and shoulders above everything else. They were still actively crackling and popping when they arrived at our table. The flavor was delightful and they had just the right amount of crunch. As for the rest of our items, I enjoyed the potato spiral but found the accompanying sauce to be rather unfortunate. The flavor was unbalanced, too spicy, and it didn't complement the potato very well. The pork belly was nice, but arrived with no seasoning, and its sauce was also lacking for me. For $25 for the meat alone, I didn't feel as though we got our money's worth.

Once we'd finished, my date ordered the green tea biscuits for a light dessert. By this time, the restaurant had cleared out and we were the only ones left. Somehow, it took 20 minutes for dessert to arrive at the table. I can't imagine a scenario where that's acceptable. Once our server finally brought them out, there was no mention or explanation for the wait.

My biggest gripe is that there are very few gluten free options at Seoul Food. I enjoyed what I had, but with so few things to choose from, I imagine I'll end up ordering the exact same thing on every repeat visit -- and that's no fun. Seoul Food: if you're listening, expand your GF offering. We're a loyal people and we'd like to eat as well as everyone else.",2017-02-01 17:05:13

Too bad the staff are oblivious to basic customer service. I've never been in, so i asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop.

Then I had a seat, but no one came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the ""order here"" sign. I got up and asked, ""is this where I order?"". They responded, ""wherever...."". 


It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter.

Long story short- I just can't support a company with staff that are that confused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service.

1st off, I called this location and was informed that they didn't discuss prices over the phone. So, I drove all the way down here only to see the products I wanted ( 5 pound dymatize iso 100 & Optimum Nutrition bcaa's) significantly more expensive than GNC. Don't get me wrong... it was very clean, and nice looking inside and out. The employees were very nice and helpful as well, no complaints there... but the prices suck. Point Blank Period I don't care what anyone has to say about it. I shop at nutrition stores all the time, and know prices off the top of my head. I'm not spending more than what I'm used to ANYWHERE, regardless of how many products they have or claim to be so-called ""wholesale"". So with that being said I'm on my way to GNC to use my membership points, and coupons that was sent in the mail. Thanks but no thanks. Pass.",2018-01-14 00:25:51

This time was no exception. I had heard from another yelp elite friend about some dish off the menu called Islamic noodles and decided to try it. And I have to say that it was absolutely delicious! It's basically noodles with vegetables and your  choice of protein tossed in a nicely seasoned creamy curry sauce. Sooo good!! This is a dish I will definitely order again. 
On the bad side, the water quality here is really really bad. I normally just have tap water with my food but the water here tastes chlorine! It's like drinking diluted bleach. I don't know why the water tastes so bad here because everywhere else in Toronto the water quality is good. I think Salad King should look into this because it really brings down the food experience. 
Because of the poor water quality I rate them 3 stars, although food alone would get 5 stars.",2017-05-17 13:52:22

But don't come here if you're in any hurry, the service is slow. Depending on the time of day, expect to wait quite a while to be seated. Unless you're eating in the middle of the night - anywhere close to meal time you'll stand in a long line to wait for seating.

They have a great outdoor patio that faces the pool area. It's beautiful! But if you sit out there be willing to wait even longer for a server. We ate there for breakfast this morning. It took an hour to get seated, and then another 15 mins for our server to come over. He was attentive in placing our order and getting drinks, but our food took another half hour to come out. He didn't bring salt or pepper and we had to wait another 5 mins for him to come back and check on us. The food was good, although they put the wrong cheese in my omelette (was supposed to be goat cheese and they put cheddar - WAY different). When our server brought our check he never fame back for it. We waited and waited and finally took our bill inside to pay.

As a side note, they always have 3 daily specials for boarding pass members (Red Rock player's card holders) - one breakfast, one lunch, one dinner. Today's breakfast special was 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, hash-browns and toast for $3.99. Dinner was Salisbury steak and potatoes for $9.99 - not too bad.",2013-03-25 01:02:15
J5NX-9IOTpTO1jKkMsBspQ,Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,ruPFtD9dU6Cv9_wpzIR4UQ,4,2,2,2,"This cafe is most known for their graveyard midnight specials. Ever since the ol gold coast closing their cafe down, and Orlean's stopped having a good deal, this is the place to go for their $3.95 Steak n Egg's deal ! 

Sometimes they are super busy, resulting in a long wait line. Sometimes you walk straight in. Depends on if there are any events or holidays or even weekends. I even had one experience where we came here late at night/early in the morning around 4-5am, on a memorial day weekend, and they ran out of steaks ! 

Due to their huge popularity of their midnight menu, their consistency ranges widely. If theres a lot of people, you have a fairly low chance in getting the correct cook temp on your steak. Being a guy who loves his medium rare steaks, you can't cook it for too long otherwise you'd go into the medium to medium well territory fairly easily. Huge cafe, tons of people, im pretty sure they don't have that many cooks doing the orders. Not easy to keep an eye on every single steak and pay attention to how through it has been cooked. 

Aside from the 3.95 steak n eggs, there's also other items on the menu like biscuits & gravy, ham steak & eggs, eggs & bacon/sausage, for different prices (lower than steak n eggs i believe) 

Steak & Eggs - $3.95 - 6 - 8oz ny strip with 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast. 

Meat quality isnt the greatest. Definitely you get for what you pay but at 12am, there's almost no other deal that you can get. 

As i had said before, i like my steaks medium rare, but also don't mind it being less than medium rare. So as one of my friends has taught me, i order RARE. Rare typically is a heat kissed steak with a cold, red center. Once in a while, i do get that, but usually the ""rare"" will end up in medium rare (pink, warm center) to medium (minimal pink) territory. 

Aside from the steak, i order over-easy eggs and toast. Egg's are usually pretty spot on, in terms of cook, which is a good thing. I love a nice rich runny yolk with my toast. 

Service wise, you'll have two people. One who takes your order, brings your food, and your receipt to take up to pay, then never see again.... Then the other, who does your drink orders and refills. You'll see the drink guy much more often than the actual waiter/waitress. 

Overall, great place to get a midnight meal. 

Note: you aren't limited to 1 order per person. if you ARE definitely hungry, you can order two and share or just eat both your self :P om nom nom !",2014-03-03 04:52:35

I've been here a few times, but my most recent visit was on a whim with my wife (because cooking is time consuming and we were already hungry). Overall Seoul is a unique experience in the Charlotte scene that boasts an amazing meat selection, creative cocktails, and a great presentation for sharing. 

When starting off with a drink, don't be afraid to go off the norm and try something other than the local craft beers. While I got a Sapporo on draft during my most recent visit, our waiter encouraged me to try the yogurt soju on a previous visit. It was an impressive display hitting the table still in the shaker while smoking from the addition of dry ice, and was an overall hit at the table.

Getting to the meat of the restaurant, the portions are large and come out on a large tray to promote sharing (think family style, but with an edgier presentation). My wife and I got a small serving of wings, pork belly (one of the best in the city), and ribs and were unable to finish everything. Also don't make the rookie mistake we did and only order meats. They have some neat sides that are worth trying.

Again, Seoul is a unique addition to Charlotte and I would certainly encourage others to try. Also be sure to watch the K-Pop music videos playing in the background for some unexpected entertainment!",2017-01-20 02:31:04

Complimentary glasses of champagne, mimosas, (or sangria on the weekends) come with each service. I.e., you get three services and you get to enjoy three glasses of bubbly.

A glitter bar with all colors of glitter in the spectrum is there to enhance your regular or gel polish. Trust me, you have never seen twinkle toes like these.

Paraffin, sea salt and sugar scrubs, moisture masks and callus removals are offered with the spa pedicures (select two).  $35-$45 is a great value when you look at the price of a spa pedi at a resort, and you don't get a drink with it, either.

Waxing and threading are offered here, which is an added bonus.

Raisa, the amazing tech that did my spa pedi, gel glitter nails, and eyebrow threading, has been an aesthetician since 1978 - and you can tell she has the confidence and experience to assess your needs and make the right recommendations.  Not to mention she gives an amazing foot and leg massage, and her Nail work is divine.

I sing the praises of this spa, and owner Tracy VanBibber, a 30+ year veteran of consumer product goods with a 19 year history at Kraft Foods, and 7 years as Senior VP for Henkel.  You can tell upon meeting her that she is committed to quality, excellent service with a personalized touch, and she knows how to run and manage a business.  Although she had two managers at the salon that morning, I saw her busying herself with cleaning, restocking, managing the front desk, and monitoring the work of her very capable technicians.

There are a total of twelve spa pedicure chairs.  Of note is The champagne room, a private area ideal for couples. 

Last but not least, I love that the salon has a liquor license, and the fact that the salon can be rented out after hours for private parties.  So this is an ideal destination for bachelorette parties, birthday parties, and other functions where a wine bar might be a perfect private addition to an event.

Busiest times are Friday Saturday and Sundays.  Weekday mornings are perfect and an dial time to go and receive the royal treatment.

Thank you to the wonderful staff at M3V, as this is my new salon of choice for nails and waxing!",2015-06-15 00:31:51

I highly recommend trying the combination appetizer. The fried sweet potatoes are so crispy and delicious. The spring rolls are a little greasy but really tasty.

Um...yeah hi, how are you or how about a hey I'm going to be your waiter. Anyways... just thought he was super busy which is ok. Once he's back with our drinks he takes our orders. We both order the same meal, steak and shrimp with broccoli. My girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions. I want to add more shrimp to my order. Our meals arrive, mine looked fine but hers had two orders of mashed potatoes,  mushrooms and onions. Looked strange at first but whatever we went with it, we were hungry. 

Here is where it gets interesting. As my girlfriend was eating her mashed potatoes she feels a chewy piece in her mouth. She takes it out and it looks like a piece of toilet paper or some kind of white paper. (We had brown paper napkins only, not a single white napkin or paper on the table.) The bad part is, this was one of her last bites and didn't think of returning the food at that point. So, to not make scene we just inform our waiter about the piece of paper and advice him to let the cooks know to be more careful. He grabs our plates, grins and doesn't say a word....ok. He then comes back and sets the check on the table and again walks away. It gets worse, we notice all of substitutes were charged as well. Did he not understand what a substitute is? We ate it so whatever, we were over it and just wanted to leave. I would rate the food a 5 star for taste minus the paper in my food but 0 stars for service. 

Hint to the waiter:

Next time attempt to act like you care. A simple, Im sorry let me see what I can do, goes a long way.

The restaurant itself is pretty small, but they have two party rooms that you can book, away from the crowd. This is what we did as we were celebrating my brother's and mine's birthday.

The food is representative of northern china and one of the best restaurants in toronto, in my opinion for this type of food. For people that are used to southern  style food (HK and Guangdong), this will be a good change! 

We ordered a variety of things such as the inside out fish (amazing, my fave), duck and buns (very tender, had bones so we had to take it out to put into the buns), steamed chicken with sticky rice in banana leave (very tender and not overly salty), lobster (fried in garlic and onion, but i feel like they steamed it first or did something to make the texture silky), jellyfish, pork, mushroom soup (my second fave - so light), veggies with mushroom, eel (spicy, but delicious), sui long bai (very flavourful! one of the best i've had), shanghai noodles, and tofu noodles (very unique. long strips of tofu noodles - kind of reminded me of this chinese ingredient, but don't know how to say it in English), You can make all the dishes spicy or not (for weaksauces like myself). They plated the food nicely with these wax figures from china. It was pretty cute. 

For our birthdays, we got a choice of noodles or their sweet soup for free. We choose the sweet soup with pieces of sticky rice, egg, and glutinous balls in it. It was really good.

It was so good that I devoured the food and forgot to take pics of each dish.

I recommend coming here with a large group of people so that you can try everything. They do have an English menu for people that cannot read chinese (like myself).

The menu is just all pictures with no organization really and has no detail of whats in it.  Then when food came out it was bad timing because some peoples food came out way earlier than others so you may have to sit their for a while watching other people eat.  Then the food I ordered was the Korean short rib which was a complete rip off seeing how it was only 3 strips (maybe) and a piece of lettuce for 9 dollars.

As we sat down, I started to recall that the name had come up as a decent choice for late night eats in particular. The presence of the ""lunch special"" menus on our plates jogged my memory - this was a place where you could get cheap eats even late at night.

After perusing the extensive lunch specials menu and failing to locate the one ""premium"" dish that I would have wanted, I settled on the cheap $5.50 beef chow fun, and I chose gravy vs. dry when asked. The dish looked promising, but the most impressive part ended up being the combination of the huge portion with the low price. Everything in it - beef, broad flat noodles, and bok choy - was massively underseasoned, as if it were pad see ew but without the flavor. Sure, you could add soy sauce, but it wasn't already present at the table, and I declined to ask because the lone server was stretched and because I was planning to take the bulk of it to-go.

Speaking of which, the service was understandably slow because the one guy (who can speak Vietnamese, which is a plus for this neighborhood) was working up to six tables when we were there. This may not be the late night restaurant of your dreams for that reason. However, if you have nowhere else to be, then it's not all that bad.

I did end up sprucing up my leftovers to an edible extent, but even though the portion was great, I won't be in a hurry to come back to HF Seafood Garden. The Vietnamese restaurant next door is way better, and I'm not usually around here late at night anyway.",2015-09-29 01:42:01

Be sure to like them on Facebook and they post their daily specials on there as well as a daily riddle. They also serve everything from their breakfast and lunch menus all day until closing. I love the amount of variety I can get here. 

I have to admit that I'm not always thrilled with their daily specials, but I have to give the chef kudos for always coming up with new and inventive menu items. They'll try their best to accommodate any requests customers might have and as they always tell me, if they have the ingredients on hand they'll make it for you whether it's on the menu or not.

I didn't want to over indulge so we had 4 people coming over we ordered 5 of the organic Raspberry covered doughnuts.  They were simply fantastic.  Great flavor, moist and just plain well made.  These are definitely not mass produced doughnuts.

Only thing I could say is that we could have used a bigger box.  We ordered 5 and they were stuffed into a smaller box and 2 were stacked which caused the glaze on the top doughnut to smear on the box and the glaze from the bottom one to smear on the top doughnut.  If you pay $2.25 for one doughnut you might as well invest in a larger box.

The bar, lounge, patio and a main room. Happy Hour is only available in the bar/lounge/patio.Our group of five reserved a booth in the main dining room. 
Our server Xavier was very enthusiastic and attentive. He demonstrated his passion for food with his knowledge and thorough explanation of the menu and specialty dishes.

The traditional version of Guacamole was the starter. It is served with chips and salsa. The Guacamole was creamy with a slight amount of heat. The portion was large enough for all of us. Many of the dishes are great for sharing, such as the four Tacos Camaron served on corn tortillas. The pork was tasty and the slice of avocado provided a smooth finish. 
The next sharing was the Taquizas Brochetas. This dish consisted of several items on skewers, Grilled Shrimp, Grilled Skirt Steak and Smoked Chicken served with corn tortillas on the side along with three sauces chimichurri, salsa toreada and a mole. Each of these were excellent and a pared with a great choice of sauces.

Finally the holiday special was ordered by the majority. Chile's en Nogada is essentially a Chile in walnut sauce. It consists of a poblano pepper, walnuts, pork loin, thick cream, onion, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, apple, plantain and raisins.  It's topped w/pomegranate seeds & cilantro.  It was not very spicy, but divine.

One choice missing from the menu was flour tortillas. Mercadito only serves corn.
They also should increase the variety of wine wines by adding a Riesling.
The Margarita Tradicional was a perfect balance, just delicious.

There is a high school that is walking distance away too. Not sure if the kids there are back in school or not, but there seems to be a few just hanging out or waiting for their orders.

I don't think it is one of their fancier locations, but I saw way too many McDonald's commercials this morning while at work. Damn those $1.49 Iced Coffee commercials that kept popping up on Fox.  

And I was almost able to get all the way back home, just 0.7 more miles or so, and I failed.  Washed out of SD-6*, the covert branch of the CIA, because I couldn't stay focus and on mission like Sydney, even after she got a few molars yanked out of her jaw, and still managed to complete her mission in Taiwan (where the fake Chinese there all somehow were very fluent in Cantonese).  I guess ABC failed even harder then me, and they have a much bigger budget too.

Anyway. Anyway. Anyway. Anyway, I thought I get some Garlic Fries too, but the dude taking my order kindly told me, without shouting ""are you nuts bro?"", that they just have regular French Fries.  It is not that I don't believe the man, but all the chatter about trying Garlic Fries at the ball park, at fancy restaurants and even at McDonald's got me craving some decent Garlic Fries. So is it just being tested at selected test markets, like the San Francisco Bay Area, and not at the boring suburb of Las Vegas??? I have a very odd feeling that I have been punked!!! Not even sure if I was even the intended target, as the false rumor was disseminated over group text.

 Well, at least the French Vanilla Iced Tea was decent. A little too much ice, and tasted on the weak side, but for $2.48 for their large, it was not a horrendous fiscal disaster.

* Watched Season 1 episode 1 of Alias for the very first time, in case you are not up to date about this reference. I know it is not like GOT or Walking Dead or anything, or is it?

Well thanks for making the Iced Coffee cold for me to enjoy. 3 stars.  Mainly because the mailman that placed his order is probably going to blame you for him being confused about the 20 piece McNuggets not being a combo, and he messed up his order. He can blame it on the heat, or pneumonia or spin it whichever way he pleases, because the American people just don't care. We only want all our USPS employees to not hoard our mails and steal our drugs sent through the US Postal Service.

3 stars. Next time less ice. And have Garlic Fries!!!",2016-09-13 00:15:20
JwZqhQDUGt2oJ3_igoqLfA,s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,5,11,3,8,"A friend with Brooklyn ties wanted me and Diane to join him and his wife to experience what word of mouth was spreading as ""real New York"" pizza taste.  I had also been reading fellow Yelpers with NYC roots declaring that while the pizzas of several pizza makers in the Las Vegas valley were very good, these pies nevertheless lacked the true essence of the greatest pizza that was actually served in New York City--whatever that essence might be.  So, somewhat skeptical that another pizzeria would in fact be equal to or better than Biaggio's, Enzo's, Metro Pizza, or other pizza that other reviewers were highly touting in LV, but intrigued by the concept of some essential New York pizza mojo that I might have been missing all these years, I agreed to go with these friends to what was being hailed as the holy grail of New York pizza in Las Vegas: Dom DeMarco's Pizzeria & Bar.  The credentials sounded good: transfer of the recipes and techniques of the most awarded pizzeria in the Big Apple: DiFara Pizza.

And, now having experienced Dom DeMarco's pizza firsthand I can honestly report that I have never tasted a better multiple meat pizza than Dom DeMarco's New York style Big Apple pizza.  It is certainly difficult to put one's finger on what makes a great New York style pizza.  But I now think I know.  It should have not too much but sufficient sauce, not too much but sufficient cheese, the finest ingredients, and great dough that is cooked to the brink of charring without leaving behind any appreciable char, resulting in a light crust that is not too thin and not too thick and supports toppings well but is still supple in one's hand and juicy in one's mouth.  With tangy pepperoni, mild Italian sausage, mild but tasty meatball, mild but real ham, fresh Mozzarella Cheese, hand crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, and a few casually dropped leaves of fresh green basil, my large 18 incher was one magnificent and tasty pie!  I also sampled Diane's 18-inch Quattro Formaggio pie, and this combination of Mozzarella, Provolone, Romano, and White Cheddar cheeses with San Marzano tomato sauce was of course cheesy and delicious, as well.

At pizzerias and full-service Italian restaurants alike, we make it a point to always order 15-inch or larger pizzas, and take home what we don't finish at the restaurant to reheat for lunches and dinners at home until the leftover pizza finally runs out, which is usually within two more meals.  This way we give the pizza maker a bigger canvas to work with to produce the very best pizza he or she can produce, and we are able to derive additional enjoyment from the gooey goodness beyond our initial encounter with the smokin' hot pie resting on a pizza pan after it has been carefully set before us.  

Pizza is by no means the only major food item served at Dom DeMarco's.  The place is not a one-note wonder.  Various pasta dishes and Italian classics also appear on the menu, in addition to seven varieties of salad.  My friends took home an order of Baked Ziti, and reported that they loved it.  I had a Simple Salad, which was not so simple, boasting a large serving of mixed greens and beautiful red Cherry Tomatoes cut in half and all bathed in an excellent and very tasty house vinaigrette.  I could have easily taken half home, but I liked the salad enough, and was so hungry, that I devoured it all just before my pizza arrived.  I don't generally eat other meals on designated pizza days, to save more room to savor the pizza during dinner and beyond.  

On a normal night, after glutting on fine pizza, I might have just gone home without dessert.  But after I saw the simply magnificent Cannoli on a neighboring table, I had to have a piece of that, too.  So, my tablemates and I then split an order of the very best Cannoli I have ever experienced.  It was large enough for four to share, the baked portion was fresh and tasty, and the filling was so smooth and creamy that it didn't even taste like Ricotta Cheese.  Sprinkled with some Chocolate trails, this delicious dessert was at a level of its own in quality and taste.

The cavernous dining room is far bigger than found in most pizza palaces, but it was almost totally full on a week night.  The atmosphere was festive, with ""American Pie"" and ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" playing overhead; and servers were friendly and efficient.  It was also comforting to see a red-shirted Dom DeMarco himself standing in the back of the house offering hands on supervision.

Here is truly a classy pizzeria in the midst of Summerlin turning out authentic New York style pizza pies as one would find on the streets of that metropolis in the East that bristles with skyscrapers.  You can't get a sliced tomato pizza here, so there is still cause to enjoy that and other types of pizza elsewhere.  But for purely meat or cheese pies, it will be hard to top this culinary bastion of fine round, New York style pizza, and square, Sicilian style pizza.",2012-03-13 12:05:52

Found this place just in time for the Super Bowl.

This place rocks and makes a bold statement from the get go that this is a bar for the 49ers faithful! Why do I know that? Because there's a big ass sign outside that says so! Basically a warning for the haters to stay away haha. This place gets hyped and loud during a game and holds special events such as raffle tickets and free Jell-O shots when a Niner scores a touchdown! The beer is fairly priced.

Pamela's was closed of course, but all the lights were on, and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria. 

There was only one other table of diners, so it was very quiet in the eating area.  There are about 15 tables, and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look!  We all decided to order lemonade and limeade, which was a great choice.  The drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet.

I ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce.  It came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of French bread.  The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.  I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese.  The bread was pretty standard, so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce.  Nom!  My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which I tasted.  Not as much meat as I'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting!

For dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal.  It just feels like a good place to spend your money.  It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.  I think we'd be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood.  I really want to taste those empanadas....",2010-09-04 02:39:19

The potstickers were stuck together and the wonton skins were dried out.  The Green Beans with Beef stir fry was decent.  There were 3 kinds of soup.  The sushi looked dry.  The Orange Chicken was heavily breaded.

The pizza was decent when they brought out a fresh one.  There was a very small salad and fresh fruit section.  

There was a made to order pasta station where you could have shrimp in your pasta.  The beef ravioli, lasagne, pastas, and sauces were dried out.

All the Mexican looked dried out.  The enchiladas, cheese sauce, and taco meat.

My soup was the daily special: Boston clam chowder.   It was a bit salty and not as thick or creamy as I would have liked.

The sampler consisted of hot wings, loaded nachos, and chicken fingers.  Both chicken dishes were normal bar food quality.  However, the nachos were lackluster.  They had movie nacho cheese on them, and I could barely taste the chili.  I could have totally skipped that option.",2010-03-30 15:48:32

Typical free entree at a mexican restaurant...tortillas and salsa! It was good! Had 3 different salsa sauce provided with different levels of spicy! Good!

Ordered the nachos supreme thinking its the typical nachos. We were wrong. It was a platter with rice, guacamole on the side and then nachos submerged in sauce and cheese, or should I say soup... the nachos underneath were all soggy, it was not good. The meet that came with the platter were chewy.

Then ordered tacos. One order is 4 tacos and is 9$. Actually great price! I tried the porc and pineapple one, it was good. Also ordered the lamb one. This one was rather dry. Had to pour the whole salsa dip they gave us at the beginning... most not forget to menton how the tacos were served.

It's good at picture of what to eat as they do not show their menu online, but since they change their menu all the time, the Venison Bone Marrow pie I was looking forward too wasn't available. 
The price ranges from $20-25 an entree

  I'm actually really tempted to only give a 2 star review for what happened and but the food gets a 3.5   food was okay but not amazing. By the end of this I might have changed it. 

It's definitely not a 4 because although I would recommend the place for people to go, I would not come here again. 

The restaurant is tucked away in little Italy. Yay for free parking on Palmerston on weekends and after 6pm. It's got a lot of character in terms of decor: a small kitchen with a wood burning stove at the back, common eating table an a small bar area tucked underneath the second level staircase. The balcony on the 2nd level overlooks the whole restaurant. You feel like you stepped into a rustic otherworld. I noticed quite a bit because we had to wait. 
It started offs okay as making a reservation the hostess was very friendly and prompt to call me back. However, we arrive at 6:59 for our 7:00pm reservation and we were told that our table has not left yet and we had to wait.  So we stood there. Awkwardly in our huge winter coats. They had small benches and some chairs to sit , but our party of 5 seemed to not fit. 
Why had they booked us back to back with someone else? How do other restaurants manage this? I have NEVER experienced this before in my whole lifetime of eating out. 

We did not get seated until 730. 

During this wait time, we mulled over their meat and vegetarian menu. We ended up getting
-  the Boar Ragu Parpadelle (very flavourful and tender meat) *** $20
- the duck cabbage rolls (despite everyones raves about this, we all agreed it tasted a bit bland) **
- the ham hock pie (a pot pie creamy with a flaky top)***1/2
- bone marrow mashed potatoe side dish (creamy with a kick) **** $5
- butter and sage gnocchi (pan fried with brown butter, crunchy and chewy in the right spots) ***** $5
- winter greens with cheese (nothing special, a bit too cheese and artificial tasting even though it probably was all natural)*** $5
We shared all these Chinese style. It was a great way to try everything but one enough to try once. I would have probably would have liked a repeat of the pasta. 

For DESSERT you must get the Lemon Tart with blueberry and marshmallow. It was decadent and the highlight of the meal ($8)   We also got the Apple Tartine with honey gelato (it was good but not after the former. 

In the end it was $22 per person including taxes and tip. Quite reasonable and I expected to spend more. Our waitress was more than happy and friendly and brought up the card machine to take our individual payments. 

Actually all the staff are super friendly.It was really a bad experience and annoying that the reservation was not accurate and poorly booked. I really hoped they learnt their lesson and do not continue doing this.  

Again, come here if you're looking for a restaurant with character and you want to try something a little different.  I just won't be coming back for a long time, or I see their menu online. 

I can't decide on the star rating. Terrible beginning deserves -1star , however only some of the food had it's moments buy not all. I guess it will be a 2 afterall and a 3 if the incident didn't happen.",2011-01-24 03:35:25

In a city full of displaced Chicagoans longing for their beef, dogs, and deep dish it would seem odd to some that one of the most exciting Windy City imports to Sin City in years has arrived in the form of Japanese Street food but having been lucky enough to attend the soft opening this Saturday suffice it to say that Yusho is poised to buck the trend of ""celebrity chef"" Strip-side dining.  Owned by Matthias Merges and nothing short of stellar in its Avondale location where service, sourcing, and skills befitting his Michelin starred past found new footing in reinterpreted yakitori, a visit to Yusho at the Monte Carlo begins with the space, a jazzed up version of the original with a long floorplan plus eye-popping colors juxtaposing the gleaming open kitchen and with knowledgeable servers brought in from icons like Savoy and Robuchon without any pomp or pretense the 'experience' unfolds like few others - casually refined and a whole lot of fun, the kitchen and front of house doing each other justice even on day one.  Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.",2014-04-06 00:58:02

Almost every thing I've ever ordered from here is mediocre at best.  The very first time I ever ate here was the ONLY time that I actually enjoyed my meal --wings-- but they've since changed the wing and sauce recipe, so there goes that.

The fried bologna sandwich was almost so greasy that it was inedible, which is saying something.  I had the pimento cheese dip appetizer, which was just ok.  I've tried 2 different salads, neither of which were even worth taking home the leftovers sadly. My husband has ordered 2 of the sandwiches, and each time he has eaten it but hasn't wanted to:(

I feel like the best way to describe the food here is to say that it is only a good idea if it's really late at night and you're drunk and looking for greasy 'drunk food'.  Because maybe then you couldn't tell the difference.

The service here is almost always great, and the servers are kind and very attentive without hovering.  They even are pretty cool about kids, and have been very accommodating when friends have brought their children in on game days -- which is very cool.

The repairman that showed up was polite and had a professional demeanor.  He took a look at the AC unit and concluded that the issue was the capacitor.  He said that to replace the capacitor would cost $510.  He then began going over the options to replace the one AC unit since ours is old, and both of those options were crazy expensive at either $8,085 or $11,480.  (And on top of it all, the repairman left everything open and unplugged/unwired on the AC unit!) 

The pricing for all the options seemed way higher than they should be, so we told him we'd contact the company if we decided to go ahead with any of the options.  We had a different company come out today and it turned out to be a $100 repair to replace the capacitor; MUCH cheaper than the minimum we were quoted by The Cooling Company.  Our upstairs AC is now running beautifully.

So, one of three things is going on:  1) the company is hiring people who really do not know their stuff; 2) the company trains people to engage in deceptive practices in the hopes of scamming people; 3) the company has at least one employee who engages in deceptive practices in the hopes of scamming people.  Given all the other enormously positive reviews this company has gotten, I was particularly disappointed and disheartened with our experience.  

I'm not an HVAC expert by any means, but I have at least a vague idea of what ballpark the prices should be in.  There might be (probably are?) people out there who don't know what price range certain AC repairs should be in and they might have just been desperate enough in the hot weather to get the AC working that they might have gone for one of the options given.

You can see from my other reviews that I'm very picky about my 5-star ratings and I couldn't come up with one reason to ding a star after our experience here. This is probably the least pretentious and upscale place that I've ever given a 5-rating to.

We came back here with friends after hubby and I had a great time at the Yelp Elite event here a few months back. The actual location is two separate buildings plus abundant outdoor seating with misters and heat lamps. There was a bar area that we didn't go into, and a small cafe-type area which is where we sat. Since we were a party of 6 they sat us at the big central table, where we were elbow to elbow with other diners already there. We ordered a ton of food, beer and other drinks and it was all excellent. Our server was at the top of his game as well.

Whatever else you eat here, DO NOT miss the pretzels with beer cheese dip. I'm serious. When you think you want Bavarian style pretzels this is what you have in mind. The waiter told us that they actually do use a lye solution here, which is the traditional way of getting the dark crust on them. Most places use baking soda which is close but not quite right. And the beer cheese dip was awesome enough to just eat with a spoon.

Same goes for the french fries with dips. We demolished two large orders and all 4 of the dips we tried were awesome. The real heart of the menu is the brats though. Next time we go here (and there will be a next time), I'll order that instead of the burger. I was happy with my burger (and if relish always tasted like that I'd eat more relish), but my friend's brat looked awesome enough that I regretted not getting one.

The beer menu was extensive and everyone at my table seemed happy with what they ordered. I had a ""grown up"" Nutella milkshake which was every bit as delicious as you'd expect from the name. I'm not sure what kind of alcohol was in it- maybe spiced rum, but it was perfect with the Nutella.",2013-01-06 18:44:00

The scallops were good, but the shrimp were definitely some of the best I've ever had in my entire life, and I have had a lot of shrimp.  They were little meaty flavor bombs.  I don't know if they're always that good, but I certainly will go back to find out.

Bonefish is worth driving on 74 to get there. I think that's the best praise I can give.",2011-05-05 21:08:00

So we gave it another chance yesterday and had the steak & Lobster and it was a joke the steak I asked for med. was rare almost like it wasn't cooked. They got me another steak and it was well done. A lady with us also had a rare steak when she ordered it med. The lobster was lousy too and service was extremely slow, try 40 minutes to get a salad.

The restaurant is located half hour outside the Strip, in the Festival Plaza in downtown Summerlin, across the street from the Red Rock Casino.The GPS wasn't quite accurate, and the restaurant said to go past the Lazy Dog Cafe, and they were located across from Shake Shack and Wolf Gang Puck. 

We found the place, with plenty of parking and at 5:30 pm on a Monday, there was also plenty of places to sit inside.  We walked up to the counter and looked at the combination of chicken you could get.  Their chicken tenders were popular, and so were the chicken pieces.  I chose to get the White combination (breast and wing) which came with cole slaw and fries, and also an order of their tenders. Stephen ordered the same but with spicy slaw, while Mom got the 2 drumsticks.  The meal for 3 with drinks came to $42.

 The food came out within 10 minutes.  The chicken wasn't what I was expecting. It was coated in like a dry rub, more than a traditional buttermilk dipped fried chicken.  The outside wasn't crunchy but it did have a spice on it instead.  I would say its like the KFC fried chicken... its fried, but not crunchy fried.

 There were sauces to use on the chicken, which were mostly made of honey.  The sauce did add great flavor to the chicken, but on its own, the chicken was just ok.  I really loved the skinny fries, but the cole slaw was sub par.. very watery and not creamy.  They carry an independent soda company, as well as sweet and non sweet teas.

I would not go out of my way to eat here. However, if I were to visit Red Rock (the hotel/ casino or the national park), I would stop by here for lunch or dinner.",2016-06-02 21:06:35

When visiting the Red Rock Resort take a minute and check out T-bones. If not for dinner stop and have a drink or enjoy their happy hour. The restaurant is very nice and trendy inside. You do not need to be dressed formally but it's okay to dress up. When we visit during the summer months I will wear shorts and shirt or jeans and a shirt are acceptable as well any other time of the year. I recommend making a reservation on Open Table; I love racking up the points. If you can ask for Table 23, it is supposed to be one of the top tables in the restaurant. Also, give yourself a good 2 hours when dining here. I think of it like going to the movies and take it in as an experience. 

I am finally writing a review for T-bones and this is was my 8th time dining here. Every visit has been phenomenal. We always receive excellent service from every staff member. It starts as soon as you enter the door to the moment you leave. 
On this most recent visit we went in to celebrate my wife's birthday. We skipped out on wine and went for cocktails. The wife had several Cantaloupe martinis and I went with 3 Isaac Newtons (old fashioned meets Manhattan), they were $16 each. Once you sit down they serve you a variety of breads. I love the pretzel bread. They will bring more if requested. There are plenty of appetizers to choose from so you may need to skip on the bread. As an appetizer I selected the Seafood Jackpot. It was a jackpot for me because I love me some seafood. There are plenty of oysters, king crab, jumbo shrimp, etc., this will set you back about $75; if you are eating here you are probably not worried about the price but I think it's good to know. I think my wife had some of the crab but I ate most of it around 90% of it. I'm such a pig. 

The wife loves the Hearts of Palm salad. Lots of avocado and all the good stuff. The salad can be shared but it is served for one. Wife went with the 18 oz bone-in filet and I had the Wagyu 10 oz striploin. It was a lot of red meat so be prepared. For the sides we shared the corn, asparagus, and a sweet potato. We could have stopped with the corn and asparagus. The sweet potato was out of this world delicious. I do not think I have ever tasted a sweet potato cooked so perfectly. 

All of the food was cooked to perfection. I love visiting T-bones and I love the service. The ""Captain"", Darlene went above and beyond making our meal memorable and enjoyable. Roni was another member who helped us out and she gave us phenomenal service. The staff was so nice and personable. We had several staff members including the manager stop by to wish my wife a happy birthday. They all helped make my wife feel a little more special on her very special day. I would like to thank T-bones and the Red Rock Resort for the excellent service and food. I cannot wait to go back. Happy eating!",2016-01-08 18:53:39

I've only had appys and drinks here, but the food is good, the drinks are cold and the service is fast, efficient and professional. The placement of the bars is also quite useful. Two on either side of the main floor, one at the back... and having the coat check downstairs and out of the way? Works for me!

I'd had Checkers once before, on the other side of town about a year ago, and it was pretty darned good.  I was SO excited that there was a Checkers opening up near me!

After having a really rough day and night, my fella and I decided to just drive through for dinner. 

The food was ok.  It wasn't spectacular, but it was a step above McDonalds, and a good alternative to Jack in the Box.
The burgers were standard, but they got the ""special"" orders right (no tomato for me, no mayo for my fella), and I thought the fries were great, although they were cold when we got home, but that was our fault. 
We also tried the fish sandwich, which I thought was pretty good too, although I'd have to have the sauce on mine (fella doesn't like that kind of sauce).  

I don't know that I'll make this a frequent stop, but I think its great, like Emily R said, to have other junk food options in this area.

However, this place doesn't seem well equipped to handle large parties as the service was really slow (not due to wait staff). Our food took about an hour to come out. 

To start off the menus they handed us, the drink specials on the back we're not even being offered. We were told a new menu was coming and that was the reason. Okay, not a huge deal. I have never been here so I didn't really know what to expect from the food menu. My grandmother was British so I grew up eating a lot of English style food. A lot of their menu featured items I ate as a kid. The biggest thing I noticed right away way that a lot of them were kind of British but not the traditional/classic versions. Almost all of the menu items had a twist or spin on them. So if you want traditional style British food, look somewhere else. 

Being that a lot of the revisions turned me off from the British items, I decided to try the Korean Fried Chicken. The menu said it came with Drums and Legs. Which are the exact same thing. The drums were not that good. They tasted like old microwaved chicken. The sauce had too much vinegar in it. If you like Korean BBQ chicken, look somewhere else. To make matters worse, my wife and one of her friends both ordered the same thing. Her friend received 10 drums, my wife 8 and myself 7. But we were all charged the same price. The drums were $11. Which I find was overpriced for what I received. 

The wait staff was decent but nothing exceptional. But it is a pub, so I don't expect high levels of services. Some of the other people with us enjoyed their food, but my experience left me very unimpressed. I didn't even eat all of my wings, they were that bad. I've had real Korean BBQ wings and this were not even close to what I was expecting. 

If you want a place to hang out with some friends and grab some drinks, then this place would serve you well. Other than that, I can't recommend this place at all.",2018-04-20 14:20:56

Apparently this is Gordon Ramsay's first restaurant in Canada!!! 

Of course there was nothing wrong with the old Laurier BBQ, except it reeked of cafeteria decor... But it was damn good roasted chicken and cheap too.

So in comes Ramsay, the restaurant closes for a few months for renovations and the new Ramsay Laurier opens in it's place!

Good news, the chicken is still just as good!!! Bad news everything is about 5-8$ more expensive. Thankfully most main dishes are still affordable about 13-18$.

The poutine is quite good, very interesting flavor they put the chicken gravy in it, I like it  and I usually hate poutine... The ribs are good, fancy plating, but really... 4-5 stacked pieces for 16$. I can get more at baton rouge or bofinger for similar price and quality/taste... Fish and chips comes in a funnel you have to pour it out to eat it, fancy plating, but it was sad fish it basically told me don't eat the rest of me... I expect better from this place considering the pedigree...

Ok bofinger and baton rouge don't have Ramsay's name on it, however Laurier Ramsay is not a high end eat it's more casual so don't argue my comparison... I agree with charging more where quality and taste justifies it, not simply because there's a brand name on the door...

All in all, the place is much prettier, fancier, the crowd is fancier and hipper. And the price is still affordable. I like the free chips and pickle jars, even ate a whole jar almost by myself hehehe yes me naughty.

The cutlery is nicer, so are the glasses and the water jars have the Ramsay logo on it which is a nice touch...But seriously cucumber water? Wtf chi chi Fu Fu for what?

There's always a lineup when I'm in the neighborhood... I wonder why, although I enjoyed going there it's not stand out nor would I wait 2 hours to get a table, but it's nice to try it out to say you did it... I would go back when the crowd thins out a bit, what can I say I love freebie chips and pickles ;)

I don't really miss the old place, except we have one less place to go to for cheap food :(

This is another on my short list of places I just haven't been able to get to for some reason.  We met up at 1 and grabbed a table outside.  It was an absolutely gorgeous day and G was raving about the mac-and-cheese.  We both ordered that and it was really yummy.  Prepared like a casserole, it was full of onion and green chili, with a nice crust.  I'm pretty sure it's the best  I've had!  We were also there during HH and had some delicious beverages; my selection was the East Coast (?) and it was good enough that I had 2.

So TMI, here are some suggestions for getting the coveted 5th star:  try a different side accompaniment.for the mac-and-cheese.  The toast is weirdly out of place; perhaps a couple of oven-dried tomatoes would be good beside that dish and the toast can be crumbled on the top.

Just go ahead and buy a season pass if you plan on coming more than once, because it will save you money. The process takes longer than it should and cuts into water-play time. The locker system is nice since its a wristband and not a key that stabs you on slides and you have the fear of losing all day. (10 bucks is silly for a locker, but they have you stuck here!) 

Some of the slides are REALLY fun! A bit more advanced and ""daring"" than the other parks in town. They are newer, more colorful, and there are options for all ages. I'm sure per usual the ""lazy river"" and ""wave pool"" are full of pee. However they put enough chlorine in the water to basically blind you, so I assume the disease risk is low! 

There are a lot of annoying teenagers here. I was once one of those, though, so I fully understand. Seems like a good summer deal for teens since there really is a LOT of staff and supervision. 

The ground is freaking HOT! I don't get why AZ doesn't have different flooring or water sprinklers on the ground at these water parks!? It's hot enough to scorch the hide right off your feet. So, unless you are a total dork like me who doesn't care and will wear ""water socks"", you are either going to have to risk losing a flip flop on a slide or not walk a couple days after being here due to 3rd degree burns! 

Next issue? BEES! I saw 3 kids get stung when I was here. I actually left a line for a slide because they were buzzing all around me and I HATE them. 

As far as waterparks go in AZ, this is the best one. I suggest a cooler for your car so you can pack a lunch to eat there and save money. The food is not good and overpriced. It is however an awkward parking lot as it is all DIRT so you get muddy if you are wet and get slapped with dust while in the park if a gust of wind kicks up! Plus, you have to pay 10 bucks to park. 

No booze served, obviously... but ""someone"" told me you can hide some in the car and head out if you feel the need for a cold one. 

Have fun and don some cool water socks! Plus, wear a secure top- some of those slides are so fast it will pull your suit right off! (Yep, that was me).",2011-06-06 20:44:00

The food is not mind blowing, but it is pretty decent for the money, and the portions are fair.  Everything I have had tastes fresh, and haven't really had any issues here.

Overall, it is a solid place to eat late at night, but you won't really see me here before midnight, since there are much more places I would rather eat.

So overall, a 3 star review if you are dining here before midnight...a 3.5-4 star if it is super late and you want something fast and cheap.",2012-10-25 08:31:34

It would've got five stars but the seating is awful and the chairs are so uncomfortable.  Like standard wood chairs that are too tall for the tables.  My back literally hurts from sitting there on that cheap chair.  Pretty unfortunate that the place that devoted so much time to detail incredible copper silverware didn't look at how awful their chairs and seating are.

It wasn't a ticketed event, which meant a purchase was not required to attend, which was something new, as all of the events I've attended at CH required a reservation.  Another cool twist to this event was that Pimm's (vodka, ginger beer, lime) cocktails were going to be served (one per person limit), as per the author's recipe, which is included in the book.  I WASN'T impressed with the free beverage (too sweet), and there's a number of factors that could explain why it wasn't good, besides subjectivity, but the author was HIGHLY-ENTERTAINING in her responses to the few pre-selected topics prompted by the moderator, and then answered a few more when said moderator ""opened the floor"" to audience questions.  So entertaining was the author, and so enamored am I of Changing Hands and the fun events I've had the opportunity to experience here, that I bought a few books, both to support CH and its ability to organize fun events, such as this, and to have the author autograph them with the names I gave her a list of, so that I may gift these books to a few loved ones whom I KNOW will appreciate!  The hardcover book is gorgeous, and I'm happy to own a copy of it myself.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/changing-hands-bookstore-tempe-2?select=r61c1k4z8nqYhJopOUX-NA#r61c1k4z8nqYhJopOUX-NA

I was able to redeem a free-to-use loyalty card (a punch for every $10 spent, $100 total nets you a $10 discount on future purchase!), so not only did I leave with a few great-smelling natural soaps and lotions, but I also saved money while feeling good about supporting local Changing Hands and Mesa's Wild Women Soaps.  :)

I LOVE Changing Hands!

**If you're like me, who grew up in Asia a few decades ago and had the opportunity to experience scented Sanrio stationery, you perhaps loved this singular scent that may have ruined all other stationery for you, no matter how much more elegant they looked and felt, simply because they just weren't delicately-scented as those Japanese stationery of our childhood.  I never knew what this gorgeous scent was made from until a few years ago (five, maybe 10, or slightly more?), when products featuring pom started popping up Stateside.

Only downfall is the place isn't too big so there is often a line-up with slow turnover, so you could be waiting a rather long time to score a table.

A few months ago I blew a gasket, I lost my I entire calm demeanor, I acted like somebody possessed - and then I had to apologize. That sucked!

I was not wrong in why I was mad, and I was getting ignored for lets say two years but my outrage and how I expressed it were wrong! And then a strange thing happened! 

I got a direct number to a real supervisor.
People called to tell me they wanted to help.
Oher people called and said I was right and they were working on it. (""It"" is the new electronic water master system)

I have had perfect water runs for months now. You might ask why couldn't SRP get that done oh maybe a year ago? WelI I have not idea but I do know they have shown me the way to get results - act like a crazy person.

After moving from my apartment with a free gym facility and into my boyfriend's home and gaining almost 20 Love Pounds I said Erica ... you MUST join a gym.  I went online to complete the 7 day free guest pass.  Within a few minutes of completing the form, someone from EOS called to set me up with a walk through.  The walk through is more of a sale pitch because once you go to work out they have you sit and talk to a representative for about 20 minutes, explaining all the membership options.  I signed up!  I'm assuming if you were to say no I'm not ready to commit or something then they would have just let me use my 7 days guess pass.  Assuming!

Once you sign up for a membership, they set you up for a one-on one training/welcome session with a fitness trainer.  Again, a marketing/sales tool.  During my welcome session, I walked around the gym with a trainer, spent a few minutes working with TRX materials and the rest of the time hearing out the pitch for a trainer.  The price tag for a personal trainer is expensive.  $150 bi-weekly expensive.  I guess this would be beneficial for me if I were training for something but I'm just trying to get in shape so I decided to pass on the personal training session.

Oscar Goodman. The (formerly) happiest mayor on earth. And former mob defense attorney. He and his image are quintessential Vegas. I had to try his steakhouse. 

Entering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night, we were seated right away. Service can only be described as short and surly. From the hostess to the two servers we encountered, I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time. A stark contrast to, say, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget (see separate review). 

The menu is mob-inspired, consisting of names of gangsters you'll recognize. I went with the Spilatro's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It may not look like much from the attached photo, bit it was actually quite good. 

The restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career. I think the theme works fine here, and the location is great. It's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly, directly at the West end of Fremont Street. The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience. It's an excellent view. 

All in all, the food was good. The theme was fun. But the service not so much. I'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service. How do other places like Vic's get it right consistently and places like this don't? I think it starts at the top. Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them. Consistently. 

Oscar's needs to make an attempt, here. And until they do, the servers will bring down the house. This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week. 

I sincerely hope they do bring it around because I'd like to see this place survive. If enough people point this out to them, maybe they will.",2012-04-08 16:18:31

While the food was good I was extremely unhappy with the service. Fantastic that you can turn around someone's food in like 5 minutes but that doesn't mean we like to eat and leave within 30. I watched the waitress come over to the table next to me and tell them that they had a lot of people waiting at least 15 minutes for tables. So she essentially asked them to leave when they were trying to enjoy some bottomless mimosas. 

The hostess then came to our table questioning who sat us at the table and proceeded to tell us that they had a reservation at the table and plenty of people waiting for tables. At this point it was clear this is how this place turns over tables so we just left. The chances that we return is very slim.

From a design perspective, on a warm day, the space can't be beat.  There are garage door walls that can be opened fully giving it a perfect flow from indoor and outdoor.  The patio is nice with one major complaint.  The patio tables have a round support underneath that prevents a diner from getting close to the table.  Instead, you need to lean in order to reach your plate or sit sideways.  I  can't imagine anyone sat at these before deciding to purchase.  The bar features beers from the west coast as well as local brews and I thought it to be well curated.  They have an diverse menu with appetizers, a solid salad selection, sandwiches and tacos.  The last, tacos, are a head scratcher for me as it doesn't really fit with the rest of their offerings.  We stopped in on a Mother's Day Sunday and were told up front the kitchen was slammed.  Knowing this, we opted for a salad and the pork torta.  The Spring Salad was just ok with lettuce comprising most of the salad.  I don't understand why restaurants shy away from the other vegetables shining through.  It's spring in Wisconsin, take advantage of it.  For my torta, is was also just ok.

We decided on Sunday due to the all-you-can-eat enchilada special they advertised, only to find out we were one week too late.  They now have the all-you-can-eat special on Wednesday after 4pm, however call ahead to make sure.  This would have been a great way to try their 3 menu pages of different enchilada styles and sauces. 

The place itself is very colorful and big, but with only one server it seemed like we waited a bit on everything.  So I guess you can seat yourself and wait, wait ,and wait.   She finally came over to take our drink order and then shortly came back with chips and salsa.  The chips were underwhelming but then again we did come here for their enchiladas so whatever.  She came back, took our order, and then returned shortly with cups of their Fideo soup.  This was pretty simple but good.  

They have about 15 different types of sauces to choose from, and an order of enchiladas comes with 4. You may mix it up with 2 different choices, and you select cheese, beef, or chicken.  We ordered Guajillo, Encacahuetadas (Japanese peanut sauce) Pipian (pumpkin seed sauce) and Mole. We chose cheese as filling for all except the Mole which we chose chicken.  The cheese by the way is crumbled fresh cheese, so don't expect melted shredded cheese like I was.  All were uniquely different and made with fresh corn tortillas and served with rice and beans, however our food was served warm almost cold.

We waited a good 30 minutes for our food so I did not expect warm food. This spoiled it for me. Sauces can take on a different taste when served warm or cold and was just a turnoff!   There were only 2 other occupied tables and they had alreadybeen served so there was no excuse.  

The food wasn't awful but I am sure we would have had a different experience and been able to recommend should they have served hot food.  We should have said something, but instead we just won't be rushing back.",2016-02-15 22:03:10

My husband and I shared a combo (a huge piece of fried chicken, fries and a soda for $15.99).  It would have been way too much food for me to have on my own, but it wasn't quite enough food for 2 people.  

We got the salt and pepper flavour with a little bit of spice.  It was really salty, slightly spicy, and very oily/greasy.  The piece of fried chicken was essentially an entire chicken breast flattened out with the bone in.  The boneless parts were ok, but the bony parts were difficult to eat. It came piping hot.  With some bites the breading actually separated from the chicken and all I got was a mouthful of breading.  Not only was the breading salty, but the chicken was salty too (like it was marinaded in salt).  However, the chicken was moist and tender.  

The fries were good though.  They were lightly battered and seasoned.  I love ketchup but I didn't even need ketchup for these fries!  

The passion fruit soda was good.  It wasn't too sweet and it tasted like passion fruit.  

It's kind of a fun concept and it's different than any fried chicken that I've ever had, so I'm glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't again.",2016-03-02 04:05:30

The first wing was good, but time I made it to the second I realized I couldn't eat anymore. Between that and the deviled eggs it was so salty I couldn't take it.

The tavern has a solid beer list and from the reviews, a menu that most people enjoy.  I was not one of those people.  Craving some comfort food from a long weekend, I opted for the Green Chili Mac and Cheese while my girlfriend went with Pastrami King.  The mac and cheese promised roasted poblano peppers and jalapenos but I wouldn't have guessed that by what I tasted.  Not that creamy and definitely not the peppery overtones that I was expecting.  A very normal and bland dish.  My girlfriend's sandwich fared a bit better.  The pastrami was delicious and well smoked but it's companions on the bread (sharp cheddar, horseradish mayo, lettuce, tomato, and red onion) was poorly constructed and was sloppy to eat.

The room was gorgeous, with dark reds and Indian pictures all over the walls. Not too big , just enough for it to be busy on a Tuesday evening. They also have a small patio outside, which gives it a casual feel.
Now I am much more of a lounge kind of girl, so right away I liked the feel of this place for dinner. Highly recommend for taking a date!

You can be a dressed down or up, with 2 or a group. They will accommodate accordingly. (we had a table of 9 beside us and right away I noticed the difference in service....(drink refills , bread coming out faster etc.). With us (2 people) ,food came out fast and we got privacy. They were always just close enough to notice we needed servicing. (although, this could be because we had a group close to us... )
Over all service from wait staff was really good. 
Only con, bartender didn't know how to make drinks. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!. That's after me getting it changed twice!. I had to settle for sprite!...ughh...
so for appetizers we had the fried coconut shrimp - delicious!!..breading was golden and shrimp was perfectly juicy.
for entree - I had the butter chicken and my girlfriend had the Lamb curry - WOW. The latter was soo tender.
Both dishes came with rice AND naan (the traditional bread)
Desert - I had the Carrot Halwa - came with vanilla ice cream. Sweet and would be pretty good with tea.
My girlfriend had the fruit/mango  custard. This wasn't so bad. Light and creamy with chunks of fruits and a blueberry on top. lol.
The Bill came up to $64.64 (excluding tip)
Besides drinks, I'd go back for dinner and try the regular menu. They had some interesting things I'd like to try out.

Taking something so simple (Brushetta, A Cheese Plate, Soups) and turning them into ""works of art"" is an art in itself. Have eaten mostly everything on the menu at one time or another and am NEVER disappointed. They even changed my mind about liking brie - well of course their ""Triple Cream Brie"" had a lot to do with that - heavenly!

Their Brushetta, in addition to being beautiful to look at is absolutely FABULOUS Haven't had one I didn't like, in spite of the fact I am NOT all that fond of Smoked Salmon or Tuna, but loved their preparation!

Did I mention the ""Grilled Cheese?"" 

Don't ask - JUST ORDER IT! 

$6? Are they nuts? 

No, it is worth it!

Kind of what I think each time I order it!

Lots of fun to have many for a great selection with several people sharing. Probably ALL but the soups should be shared and even the soups can be, if you are with someone you really care about!

I thought the falafel itself was pretty right on - nice crispy exterior with warm soft center and decent flavor. But the wrap was a white tortilla from Sysco (the tortillas were in the display case behind the counter, that's how I know! Tacky!) which I thought was gross and weird. I mean even Sysco sells pita, which would have been a slight improvement. My next pet peeve about this falafel is that there were no cucumbers on it. My next pet peeve is that there were pale-totally-unripe-flavorless tomatoes on it. Sorry, I just hate pale tomatoes; if they are not in season or ripe, please spare me. The lettuce was iceberg, not the biggest deal. It had tahini on it, so that was right.

My friend Cynthia went here a few months ago, and told me it was legit! (I trust her opinion...she was born/raised in San Diego, and she knows what's up when it comes to Mexican food!)  We finally made it down here the other day for dinner.  We parked in the back lot, and walked inside.  We were greeted immediately and shown to a table.  We were served a basket of chips, browsed the menu for a bit and then placed our order.  I went with a plethora of tacos which included a fish taco, a mole taco, a cochinita pibil taco, an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco.  Here is how they were.............

Fish Taco-  They make these with dogfish.  It was a hefty sized taco and it was mighty delicious.  It had 2 pieces of perfectly fried fish inside.  I had never had dogfish until today.  It was a very meaty and chewy fish.  Most fish tacos are white fish that break apart easily.  This fish was almost like a steak!  I would definitely get this one again.

Mole Taco-  Shredded chicken with a rich mole sauce service on top of a double corn tortilla.  It was good, but not my favorite of my selections.  Not sure if I would get this one again.  A tad messy, too.

Cochinita Pibil Taco-  This was roasted pork shoulder topped with pickled red onions.  The pork was nice and moist, and the onions gave it a nice bite.  I would get it again.

Al Pastor Taco-  This taco came topped with a a decent amount of pork, some hot red sauce, some cool avocado sauce and also some pineapple.  It was definitely tasty.  Maybe not on par with my Tacos El Gordo in SD, but still a good al pastor taco.  I would get this one again.

Carne Asada Taco-  This was my favorite of the day!  This taco came prepared simple with just steak and some cabbage (It's an AZ thing..the cabbage).  This steak was so well marinated, and so tender, it was a pleasure to eat.  I wish I would have ordered maybe 3 or 4 of these things.  It was by far the best carne asada I have had in AZ, and could hold its own vs any asada back in SD.  It was incredibly legit!  I may come back and get this in a burrito from here.  Winner, winner, carne asada dinner! 

Besides the great tacos, this place has a super awesome salsa bar!  They had at least 10 different, home made salsas on display.  I tried about 5 of them and each one was unique and tasty.  They have great chips, too!  Thin and crispy!  They went well with all the great salsas.  We got 2 baskets full.

Service was on point and all the young ladies working in the place were on top of everything!  I'm glad I went here and will definitely be coming back...soon!  Best Mexican food I have had in AZ so far!",2016-03-21 19:01:07

My friend and I were saving room for dinner so we got one of those peanut butter fudge cookies and split it. The title of it alone doesn't do it justice! It's 2 peanut butter cookies with a creamy, peanut butter fudge filling.

Mabel's was quite good and the closest thing I've tried to Butter's.

They also sell things in the fridge and other foods on the side. Everything looked to be of high quality.

Also, the kind staff (and possibly another customer, I didn't ask) found my iPhone when I left it there accidentally. I was happy that anyone involved--customers or staff--were honest enough not to keep it. I'm also glad I was able to catch them after closing too.

It looked likely find of place. A nice rustic converted gas station. But then I got the menu and the descriptions horrified me. It was all froo, froo California fare. The more the girl described the specials the more my palate and brain cringed. The combinations sounded terrible. So I pulled the trigger and said ""Hey why not try the Venison Quesadillas. They can't mess that up, right?""  Well they did. It cost me $16 and it was the most bland quesadilla I've ever had. I asked the waitress what the smear on the plate was and she said""It's pepper jelly! Try it!""
Unfortunately I did. Gross. Clash of the palate!
She swung by and asked if I was finished and then grabbed the plate from me without listening to my protest as I was trying to wash the taste of that abomination from my mouth with the lettuce.
When I cashed out the other brainless employee asked about my meal and I told her that it was buzzard and some things should never be put together. She was clueless. So I told her that the food tasted like California. To which she responded, ""Great!"" ""Nope, that was not a compliment. It means that you wrung all of the flavor and life out of the food and had the audacity to not only serve it but charge me double."" Evidently the staff does not know how to respond properly to guests feedback.
It's a real shame that I had to drop by a Wendy's to get as frosty to cleanse my palate of the glue taste from the appetizer. My $5 chicken combo tasted better that the venison. For shame!

I went to the Duff's on college 2 years ago and thought it was pretty good, so I visited this location expecting the same. It was a huge disappointment. Not even ""good."" The wings were  incredibly overcooked and dry. And there was more crusty skin on the wings than actual meat. And this was on an early Saturday - not cheap Tuesdays. Add to that a dismal and pricey beer menu, the lack of ANY carrot sticks (just celery, folks - couldn't fork out the extra 20 cents for carrots) and it's just a waste of time.  I could barely choke down my first dry, chewy wing so I asked for a fresh batch - which also came in about 5 minutes. The drumettes were more moist, but the wings themselves remained dry and unappealing. I think the wings are precooked and tossed back into the fryer at the last minute. The wings came out way too fast for them to be cooked fresh. The two guys I went with were happy with their wings, but most men aren't that picky when it comes to fried meat and beer. The only good thing was the sweet potato fries, but the dipping sauce was gross (and I normally love chipotle mayo).

I'm starting to really wonder about diners in this city. Is this the best you expect? This is not a 5 star experience. The wings are drenched in sauce, there's no choice on how to get them done (breaded, plain, skinless, grilled,baked or fried). These are just FRIED, skin on, dry, horrible wings - leave your choices and expectations at the door. The wings at Philthy McNasty's are better - and I hate that place! I'm going to stop using Yelp if I keep having disappointing experiences at places with such high ratings.",2012-06-07 23:38:11

I'm still perplexed why they left given the crowd that was there on a Friday night but image they will be staying for years to come. They don't take reservations and the place was packed which made it a bit hard to get a drink at the bar but the service was quick (thank you bartender for scanning my ID for more than five seconds, you don't know how much that boosted my ego). Tons and tons of beer on tap plus beer specials of the day which allowed me to try some I've never heard of before. 

Like other locations, they have the psychedelic bus plus booths, tables and extra big wrap around booths with a backdrop of Woodstock. Service was great but the big dilemma was what to order. I am partial to their Magical Mystery Tour but was thinking about their Kosmic Karma but the Tour yet again won my heart. One o the girls I was with is vegan and they even had options for her--score! The crowd (which I found it amusing that it was packed full of yuppies) seemed to dwindle down around 815P so if you're not looking to wait long, may be a better option to wait a little for dinner. They have a huge patio area which faces Selwyn where you can watch the cars pass or drunkards of Selwyn Pub, I imagine myself coming back in the summer time to enjoy that.

Sushi burrito, pick the burritos you want or create your own. Both times here I picked the ones they have on the menu, Rockport my first time in and Long Beach my second time. The Rockport had all the ingredients I love, but the taste was lacking, it had barely any flavor. I got the combo (who does not love taro chips???). Hmmm tell me why is there huge chunks of salt and furikake on the bottom of the tray but it does not stick to the chips, making it completely pointless to have that on there. Now the turn off for me was the canned nacho cheese side for the dip. Taro chips were totally covered in nacho cheese sauce overpowering it and took away all of the are chip flavor. Nacho cheese and regular chips, but not with taro chips it does not work. In addition I saw a girl get taro chips to go and her portion looked 3x my size in a paper bag. Mine had about 8 chips filling up only 1/3 of the tray it was served in. Maybe pick another tray or fill up the chips into the entire tray so it does not look like much of it is missing. I tried putting salsa on top as the owner suggested and I am sorry, but none of the salsas tasted good with the burrito. I really don't get it at all. I tried every salsa there (which they all seem canned salsa. One I swear is Pace Picante salsa for sure.) Not a good match with sushi. I felt the portion was pretty small when my total with the combo was close to $15. 

Second time there, opted for just the Long Beach and no combo since I was not impressed with the taro chips experience. Again, no taste on the burrito.

Each dumpling had it's own distinct flavor and texture, and there was obviously alot of thought and attention placed on making each one, even when each one could all be devoured in a bite or two. The Pork Jowl dish was cooked perfectly, so the meat was on that fine line of being chewy, crisp and soft all at the same time. It was my favorite dish of the night based solely on texture and flavor. Lastly, the Salted sea bream was a new way to experience fish. We watched them laborously debone the fish and it was presented to us with the little pockets of lettuce and toppings to eat with. It was light, fresh and full of contrasting textures and flavors.

Initial Review: 
Pure Pizza is definitely the best pizza I've had in Charlotte thus far. I ordered the pesto pizza with tomatoes and red onion with a few friends, and it was superb! The crust is thin but stays crispy enough to hold up the toppings, the sauce to cheese ratio is solid, and all of the ingredients added great flavor without overpowering the pizza as a whole. You can really tell with their farm to table approach that they have high quality ingredients based on the taste alone. While this does cause the prices to be a bit higher than pizza chains, the quality more than makes up for it. My only complain is that I wish they had smaller options than 12"" so that I could get a personal pizza during my lunch hour at work- but hey maybe I'll just have to feel like pigging out or want some leftovers that day.

New:
The Slap Yo Mama Lasagna is also incredible. The ricotta, ground beef, and Italian herb combo makes this taste spot on like lasagna filling..it's incredible. The wild mushroom pizza is nice and cheesy with a strong roasted mushroom taste. Also go a free order of garlic knots which didn't have a ton of garlic flavor but were buttery and had a good bit of parmesan on top. With the marinara sauce, they were very solid. All three pizzas I've tried have been out of this world. The crust is thin but still crispy, and the pizzas come out very fast (less than 10 minutes both visits). The only downside is the slightly higher price than other pizza places but the quality justifies it if you're looking for really good pizza.",2015-07-21 11:33:51

M6G024i3zFkKji7dCjnHEA,I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,4,6,2,1,"I see that I have been beaten to the punch by 3 fellow ramen aficionados already, but here is my take.  

I would have given 5 starts if this were 4 years ago, but as the competition heats up for local ramen-ya's, I have to be a bit more stingy with my ratings.  

Before all of that, I have to be on Tatsu's defense about shichimi togarashi as August has a basic misconception about it.  

If you ask a Japanese native what you would put Shichimi on, you would hear Udon first and foremost, then hot soba, then perhaps gyudon and oyakodo.  If you ask 100 people, you probably wouldn't have anyone, maybe one or two people say Ramen.  

So what do udon, hot soba, gyudon, oyakodo, etc. have in common??  

It's Japanese dashi made out of bonito flakes (katsuobushi), soy sauce and sea kelp.  Ramen certainly does NOT.  Shichimi is a traditional Japanese condiment and you would NOT see it in a normal Ramen-ya.  I have never seen anyone nor heard of anyone putting shichimi togarashi in Ramen-ya in Japan, and I'm certain that I've been to more ramen-yas in japan than Godzilla, Candace, and August put together.  However, please....no shichimi in zaru-soba.  You deserve to get struck by a lighting if you put shichimi in soba-tsuyu for zaru-soba.  So I think it's quite natural that there is no shichimi in a ramen-ya.  If they happen to have one, it's most likely because of an unusual request from American patrons.  Personally, I don't like to put anything extra in Ramen.  It's as if you went to Kabuto, or sukiyabashi jiro or kyubei.  If you are handed a nigiri of Toro with nikiri, or hirame with sea salt and a dash of yuzu, you don't dip that in soy sauce. It goes straight into your mouth.  I do the same with Ramen, but that's just me.  

I'm sorry to digress, let's get back to Tatsu.  

I was relieved to see almost everyone there except for one having a conversation in Japanese.  This is always a good sign and it seems that they were making some final adjustments to their menu, as the grand opening is not till tomorrow.  

So I went with standard tonkotsu and chahan (fried rice).  

I was hopeful that chahan would be good as I heard a loud shaking of the wok in the kitchen.  Proper chahan making involves somewhat violent flinging of the wok to send the rice airborne so that it's directly fired up by the flame of the grille to get rid of excess oil, so that resulting rice is not greasy/sticky, what we describe as ""para-para"" kind of rice, and it was well done, although a little subtle in flavor but I like it that way.  I think they can easily add other things and make it more interesting like kimchi or takana chahan.  

So, off to the ramen.  As far as tonkotsu broth is concerned, I though that it was on a simpler side, very reminiscent of shinsengumi in L.A.  If I have to be critical, it was somewhat too simple and lacking in depth.  I'm going to give them a break as it's not far from that of Monta's and it's not even grand opening yet, but could use a little bit more depth by playing with their soup stocks, and I personally prefer something a bit fattier, like kotteri option with se-abura (back fat) and all, sort of like what they do in Daikokuya in L.A. or a lot of tonkotsu places in Japan.  

As other reviewers said, there is no option for nitamago, but I'm sure that this will be corrected by grand opening.  Also, the noodle was properly thin and straight kind which is the usual kind for tonkotsu, and it was cooked just right, although I was told that I can request to have it softer or harder.  

All in all, I think it was 3 to 4 stars.  Their tonkotsu could be heavier/deeper in flavor but that may be my personal preference, but as places like shinsengumi is doing well in L.A., some people may prefer it that way.  I really hope that they will add a kotteri option.  

The reason that I'm somewhat more critical these days is that in Japan, a ramen-ya must have some sort of unique appeal in order to survive.  When there is only Monta in town, then something standard would do.  Now that we have Monta, monta chaya, fukumimi, sora, and tatsu as the only authentic ramen places (sorry anime, shoku, koraku....you guys don't count), they each need to do something more unique.  I would go to Fukumimi or Monta for tonkotsu over Tatsu if they stayed the way they are.  And Sora's miso is way way above others and I wouldn't eat miso anywhere else unless tatsu does something impressive.  I'm hoping that they'll make some more adjustments and improvements to be competitive with fukumimi and monta as far as tonkotsu is concerned, and I'm intrigued by tsukemen as no one else offers this option at this time.  I'll revisit in a few weeks and let's hope that they will move in a positive direction.",2013-06-30 21:06:44

Even though I love my burgers medium rare, I've decided that in this age of E. coli, listeria, and who knows what else, I'd better be ordering them well-done.  At this place they must have them pre-cooked because, before I could even check in on Yelp, the waitress put the burger in front of me!

Surprisingly, it wasn't dried out.  But that doesn't mean it had any flavor, either.  It didn't.  As for texture, it took me back to when I was a kid.  My mom used to mix Kellogg's Corn Flakes into her chopped meat to hold the burgers together.  I hated that cereal taste and the big yellow pieces of corn flakes, and always begged her to leave them au naturel, i.e., MEAT, just plain old unadulterated meat.  Once in a while, fed up with my whining, she'd do that, and...the burgers fell apart!!!  The look and consistency of the Grand Cafe burger was exactly that.

Back to flavor, the menu said the Southwest Burger came with chiles and jalapeno jack cheese.  I expected chopped chiles, but was happy to see long, wide strips of green chilis - rajas - draped across the whole burger.  That, the cheese, and the chipotle mayo that I had on the side saved a tasteless burger from being just fill-the-stomach fodder.  The cole slaw could have benefited from some flavor-tweaking, too.  It hadn't marinated long enough, and had no seasoning whatsover added to a bit too much mayonnaise.

I blame this primarily on their menus always consisting of over one hundred different entrées (literally!) that all essentially read/sound exactly the same. If you don't have someone pointing you in the right direction, I'd compare it trying to decipher a medical bill. Lots of Xs, lots of accents over letters, and wait - is that even a real word? I suggest disregarding the menu. Just look at the Yelp pictures and make a decision.

I usually get a fried rice entree with a combination of meats (sans shrimp) or a plate of grilled beef with rice, while upgrading to a fried egg. My girlfriend usually gets a similar-styled dish, only with chicken instead of beef. Everything we've ever had offers up very good flavor and quality for the price you pay. Although you wouldn't expect it, their Thai Tea (with boba) is significantly better than some legitimate Thai restaurants we've visited in the city.

They're big on their word-play t-shirts/slogans - which is now mandatory at all Pho-based restaurants.  

Service wise, they can be somewhat slow - especially if they're busy. If you need your check, you're better off just going up front and requesting it. I suggest not waiting around for anyone to come check on you. They also have a tendency to neglect cleaning tables of finished parties when they're not busy. We've walked in on Sunday afternoons before to find four or five tables littered with leftovers. They're in no rush to clean them either.

Super busy, people lined up out the door. And that's the first impression I got when I arrived. There is no proper system to seat people whatsoever. There were two girls at the front counter. One was the cashier and one was the hostess taking people down to their tables. However, when the hostess was gone and people keep coming in the girl at the cashier totally ignored them. At least tell them to line up behind the sign so that when the girl comes back she can take their names. In the crowd of people at the door we were totally lost and this other person who just came in totally cut in front of us partly due to the fact that there was no organized line. She can also tell some people to wait in the outside area after they got their number and they could have cleared the space. 

In terms of service I totally agree with the other reviews, there was no organization. Tables were not being cleared fast enough and people seated. Hard to get the servers' attention and they were not attentive.

Now to the food. I ordered the Spinach and Cheddar omelette. Portions were huge and tasted pretty healthy. It also comes with potatoes which were tasty and fresh food which I appreciated. Also if you checked-in with Yelp you get a free fruit cocktail of the day, made with fresh fruits and no sugar added. Which made my experience a bit better. 

Overall, I will definitely think twice before coming here on the weekend. The process of the line-up and getting a table is a bit frustrating, which is not what I want on my weekend. Other than that the food is pretty good so if I'm ever free on a weekday I may consider coming here.",2016-07-07 15:41:29

x_gDhqg-EK7decPI3wsTuw,AwyM03qzhwgyskBruurWQw,Ixp4JlKM1cuXloJ3xxYQDg,2,4,1,2,"The concept is good: an outdoor wine festival with a dozen or so vineyards pouring samples of well over 100 wines, while other vendors either sell food or you score a seat under a tent to watch a gourmet food demo with plenty of samples.  Live music under the band shell and plenty of people watching under Carolina blue skies.

And now for the twist: all of the wine is from NC vineyards and apparently a memo went out to all 20-something guidos and guidettes that this event was mandatory attendance.  

Bottom line: hard to see how the $25 ticket price results in anything close to a break-even investment.

Look, NC wine is not presently on the wine world map.  Mainly sweet wines derived from muscadine, strawberry, and blueberry, this is not an event designed for the serious wine connoisseur.  While the winery reps will still flash the smile and a micro pour in your glass, this is not the kind of stuff you could stand more than a glass or two of in any one sitting.  Yeah, there are some folks trying to work with Bordeaux grapes, but the NC climate is not ideal in most parts of this state and these wines are generally lacking in the structure and finish that is prized in more established wine regions.  *Save for the highlight I'll mention below... 

Add to that the fact the the crowd mentality possessed by other attendees is utterly lacking in the areas of ""waiting your turn"" or ""listening to the professional,"" and you have a less than ideal tasting experience.  For example, some wine tents were impossible to get to because there was a small mob at the front that kept thrusting their glasses forward for the next pour.  Other people from behind the mob were not afraid to reach over shoulders to get a pour for themselves. 

I can understand why some reps were grumpy.  I can also understand why some folks were grumpy since they could never reach the front of the line.  Folks had no concept of running thru a pour of the portfolio and then moving away for the next group to come in.  My favorite was a small group of ladies who would thrust their glass in from the side and boldly interject, ""Can you pour some sweet wine?""  A serious percentage of people here were just looking to drink, rather than learn about a winery or its portfolio.  That makes for a serious downgrade.

So the one highlight?  There is one region of NC doing some exciting things with Bordeaux grapes- the Yadkin River Valley.  Just west and north of Winston-Salem, these guys apparently have the climate and technique down to get some pretty good juice.  I tasted a couple of Merlots that would do well in a blind taste test against more well-known competition.  I also tasted an oaked Chardonnay that need not bow down to any of the big Cali chards that rule the current market.  There is hope here, but sadly there was a lot of swill to get thru to find it.",2011-10-07 01:00:19

Usually I wouldn't pick places like that but since it was a party of 30, I wasn't going to change the place just because there's peanut shells all over the place. But really it turned out to be a great place that had a perfect area that sat all 30 of us. 

The service was really wonderful...when I called in to make the reservation twice...since at first I thought it would only be a party of 10 but more people decided to come so it went up to 30, the guy that took the reservation was really nice about it, even asked me if I was bringing a cake. The waitress that served us was also pretty awesome.

The portions of the food was huge and cheap and oOoh the wings are a bomb and what was even better was for Tuesdays it's only $6.50 for a dozen of any flavor wings.

As other people have described, it's basically made to order wood fired personal pizzas. For my pizza, I got tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, capicola, tomatoes, and basil. 

The overall taste was just underwhelming. The sauce and the pizza dough were under seasoned and the ingredients were just not that fresh or of high quality. If you're going to have a personalized pizza business like this where you can add a variety of toppings, the owner/chefs should work on perfecting the sauces and the dough so that the pizza has a good base of flavors. I doubt I will go here again. You're better off going south to Phoenix and getting some pizza from Nook or Pizzeria Bianco.

This modern rustic restaurant is located in the back section of the Venetian Resort on the north end of the strip. They are fairly popular so you may need reservations or a long wait during peak periods.

This is modern Southern cooking with fried foods and sweet drinks. The star is the fried chicken which is pampered and prepared beautifully to enjoy. The brining makes it juicy and tender with a great crust and flavor. The combination of fried chicken and watermelon is a bit of a stereotype, but it is hard to argue with the flavor especially combined with a decent, but somewhat underwhelming waffle. Try the chicken with different sides.

I had to order one of their specialty drinks, because Vegas sober is like fishing sober. I had a mason jar with whiskey and peach which was sweet and refreshing like a good Southern night. It is hard to drink too much with sweet drinks, so it helps temper the booze into a slow rush. They have a great selection of cocktails and would make a great place for just drinks and shared side dishes to start your Vegas night.

Yardbird is a nice option for the area and a good fit in the Venetian, which is already home to lots of great restaurants. It is rather pricy for the style of food, but you cannot compare it to your favorite chicken shack at home - both lose with that comparison. Drink booze and eat chicken y'all!",2017-07-12 23:33:06

So to show what truly nice people I have encountered thus far in Las Vegas, Joe not only makes a recommendation to this place, BUT gives me a $4 off coupon & meets me on Tropicana Ave to give it to me and drives me there with his wife & daughter as they were on their way to run errands. HOW COOL IS THAT?? (Answer: VERY!!)

 So I ended up paying $5 and change for this AWESOME Buffet using the coupon. And let me tell you now THIS PLACE IS HUGE!! The entire dining area has to be as big as a basketball court if not bigger. And for the size and the crowd on hand, it was a very nice and orderly atmosphere, well lit and pleasantly quiet with no crying babies and no standing up ""Peekers"" looking over the back of the booth I was sitting in. (I like to feed them string beans!!)

I asked to be seated in a booth and was gladly told to sit wherever I wanted. There are several stations = BBQ, American, Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and a HUGE island of deserts.

I made a good attempt to try as many items from as many stations as I could and ended up liking the Chinese station the best that had spring noodles mixed wt vegetables & Beef  that was really fresh and good.

Joe had really pushed the BBQ Beef ribs saying they were the best but the selection the day I went had ALOT of fat on them and I had to pick at them to take it off. And while I'm complaining I might add that the onion rings, fried fish & chicken fried steak had ALOT of breading on them that had me picking at it as well. Other than that though I really cant complain and have to give this place 2 thumbs up.

The Mexican station was extremely good with beef tacos and all the toppings and a spicy shredded chicken that made nice tacos as well. There were other selections such as enchaladas etc and it all looked very good.

The Italian station had speghetti, lasagna, pizza that all looked really good too. I have a sliver of a slice and it was very good and crispy and I tried a couple pcs of eggplant parmesean and it was off the hook good .

There was also peel n eat shrimp wt tartar & cocktail sauce as well as crawfish which looked good and I had one and still cannot see what the draw to these things are as its alot of work for very little pay-off in the way of meat. I chose to stick wt the shrimp & mixed them in wt my Chinese noodles mix & sliced open a couple spring rolls and put them inside. I always ""shrimp out"" my spring rolls!!

The aforementioned Desert Island had a little of everything = soft serve ice cream, strawberry & whipped cream toppings, scooped Ice Cream, Gellato, Pies, Cakes, Cheesecake, & cobblers. I tried the Coconut Cream Pie and the filling was off the hook (I had 2 pcs and had to stop myself from getting more!!) but the crust was soft and mushy-like and not to my liking at all and I didnt eat it. I also tried some soft serve Vanilla Ice cream  wt whipped cream and the taste of the shortening in the whipped cream came through and more cream & sugar was needed.

The waitstaff seemed nice enough but my Ice Water was'nt refilled, nor was I asked if I needed a refill. I didn,t so it wasnt really a big deal. The girl taking the plates off the table seemed to be working the hardest and I felt bad for her and took my plates up myself several times. I also hid a dollar under my dish within a dish so she would find it and not the waiter as she deserved it more than the waiters did.

So, that being said, when I came to Erie Island this morning to get in a little bit of studying, I ordered a hot Chai.....and was thoroughly disappointed.  Overly artificially sweetened and I swear I could barely taste any spice in there at all, tasted like hot sweetened milk.  But, I can't really be blamed, I mean, its a COFFEE shop after all, right?

Just recently came back, cuz my cousin from Vancouver was visiting and she's vegeterian, so we went to ChuChai...

I'm quite impressed with this place, since everything is completely vegeterian, no meat no fish sauce whatsoever. That's a tall order if you're cooking thai food.

I'd say it is a bit on the sweet side, everything is slightly sweet, I mean Thai cooking has a lot of sugar but this is is slightly sweeter than usual. Nothing a little lime can't fix really.

we ordered pad thai, tofu with peanut sauce and fried spinach, mock penang beef, papaya salad, fried egg noodle which tasted like chow mein, and peanut sauce dumpling. 

The flavor is distinctly Thai, which is impressive, since a lot of dishes have fish sauce or some sort of prawn paste in it, and frankly i doubt i'm not sure i detect those hints of flavors missing... they found a way to substitute without cutting out the taste.

The penang was the weakest, it lacked a bit, but the tofu with fried spinach is spot on. Being a meat eater it's not on top of my list but it's a nice place to go if you have a veggie friend, lol and we all have one or two of those :P",2010-07-14 17:48:36

Don't cry for me or anything, but this is where I enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner. Yes, I almost cried for myself, but I can be overly emotional. I was there with my husband, so there was really no reason to get all sentimental, but enjoying Thanksgiving dinner at a ""video poker bar"" seemed like an experience worth a little drama. 

We didn't have any beer, so no tear in my booze jokes will be employed! However, we did have a $13.95 AYCE Thanksgiving feast that left my husband proclaiming it was the best Thanksgiving dinner he had ever had. Of course, I would disagree because I thoroughly adore my mother's Thanksgiving dinners. Still, I have to admit I was surprised by the quality and obviously by the value! When plenty of people were shelling out $30 or so dollars for buffets and other dinners around town, we were having a bottomless bevy of Thanksgiving treats for $14! 

And, the food was unexpectedly noshable. We had turkey that was tender, sausage dressing that was moist and flavorful, fresh cranberry chutney , green bean casserole, mashed potatoes and the option for pumpkin pie! I will say that I did not love the mashed potatoes, but I still ate them all! I thought the gravy lacked a little kick. Still, the tastiness and value combined brought a little smile to my face!

The service was friendly, and even the manager stopped by to say hello. Plus, I was impressed with the interior. It wasn't busy, so there was probably considerably less smoke in the air. However, the bar area was spacious with plenty of televisions. 

Yes, maybe I was ""trypting"" on a Turkey Day sentimental high, but I have to believe that any place that can pull off a delicious holiday feast is a place worth visiting again.",2010-12-03 20:01:54

This place has been sold to the people who own the wildly-overpriced Hearthstone restaurant next door. It will have a new name and a new menu coming in 2016. http://vegas.eater.com/2015/12/8/9872852/las-vegas-restaurants-mercadito-out-at-red-rock-resort-libre-in

Update 2015-10-01: They've been making menu changes and portioning changes. Tacos now come one at a time, minimum 2. Makes it way easier to mix-and-match so that's a welcome change. However they added pineapple to a previously-delicious guacamole that included bacon, and it completely ruined it. They also no longer have the BLTA taco, which was BY FAR the best taco I've ever had. On the up-side, they added the short rib taco to the menu permanently.

The nachos from the ""small plates"" menu, while extremely delicious, are much larger than I expected for my same $10. In fact, they are large enough that I could have easily made an entree meal out of the nachos alone (and I would have been happy to, because they are delicious). The tacos come four to a plate and are very well executed, and seem to be priced just slightly high but portioned very well.

Salsas are also not free. Even then hole-in-the-wall places can afford this, I know it isn't going to break the bank. Chips and salsa is a Mexican food expectation. Period.

So we're all over the map already.

The decor seems to try to be upscale, trendy, high class, with fancy plate settings (at the expense of usability, see the guacamole plate); at the same time there are TVs on the walls showing football games both in the bar and outside of it in the main seating area and my tortilla chips came in one of those bent-metal-wire things you typically get french fries or pretzels or mozzarella sticks in wrapped up in butcher paper at some crappy sports bar.

Expanding on the guacamole coming out on such a small and annoying plate, the same could be said for the entree plates. The flautas we ordered -- which are actually not flautas, they're toquitos, but they're delicious so who cares? -- are too large to fit on the plates provided except diagonally, and that makes it a pain in the ass to try to eat politely. The wife and I ended up eating them with our hands. But then...Is that what the owner intends? Is this an eat-with-your-hands kind of place? Because if so I think your waiters are overdressed, and we should talk about the ritzy place settings...

Adding even more confusion to what this place is really about.

Over the course of 20 minutes the music went from a 70s rock ballad to some bass-dropping dubstep to a Coldplay song that almost put me to sleep to the Gorillaz. None of this particularly related to the delicious food in strange portion sizes, or the upscale dive bar decor, or the Mexican cuisine.

I'm completely perplexed by this place. Primarily, the star-loss is for price/portion/plating issues. I felt nickle-and-dimed by the guac and chips/salsa, and the way most of the food was presented was needlessly irritating.",2015-12-10 22:32:39

Quite a bit has already been covered on the expansive room, so I won't dive in to that. And most of my favorite dishes have already been covered in other's reviews so here are the ones that stand out in my mind (that haven't already been described at great length):
* Chicken Corn Chowder - one of my favorite ""I'm sick"" meals. Think egg flower with minced chicken and corn.
* Honey Walnut Prawns - not quite as good as Big Wongs, but damn good!
* Pillow Chicken - minced chicken with a bunch of other crunchy good things, fried up mouth-sized dumpling style and blanketed in black pepper sauce -  yummo! 
*Sichuan Style Green Beans - the menu version is made with pork, but I have them make it vegetarian with extra spice and IT IS TO DIE FOR.

I've never actually experienced the ""frozen vegetables"" that others have suffered, so I have to think that this is more anomaly than practice. They are always willing to alter dishes to my liking (more spice, no meat, different meat, etc.) - this is a HUGE plus in my book because I love spicy Chinese.

Most Asian markets do not give off a pleasant scent, but this one is immediate as soon as you walk up to the entrance.  The strong smells are usually from the exotic variety of stuff they carry, so I can't really fault them too much.  Maybe they should try industrial sized boxed baking soda to absorb the smell?  The upside of it all, I know they carry everything I need to complete my hot pot meal.  

The produce section can be a bit lacking in terms of freshness.  The spinach and watercress could be better, but it is what is it.  They have all the exotic fruits like jack fruit and lychee.  At the seafood section, they offers services to cut or deep fry the fish for no additional fee.  I do appreciate the fact, that they carry thin slices of meat perfect for shabu shabu in beef, pork and even lamb.  

If you're desperate like me and this is the closest Asian market within 15 mile radius, that carries all the products, my options are quite limited.

We started off with Miso Soup and Inari Sushi.  The Miso Soup was good but the Inari Sushi was excellent.  The latter is something that's easily split as an appetizer.

We ordered the Omakase sushi option featuring a pretty incredible selection of really fresh nigiri sushi for $50.  There were around 12 pieces or so.

For drinks, we ordered some Fukushima Sake.  The name escapes me at the moment but it was really smooth and the two of us downed a large bottle quite easily.

Finally for dessert, we had the Japanese cheesecake which was incredibly tasty.  It's not as light and fluffy as what you would get, at say, Tetsu's Cheesecake, but it's not as dense as a New York Cheesecake either.  It's the perfect in-between.

We came right when they opened up at around 11:30am and we were greeted by someone who looked to be the owner or the person in charge. He was friendly and accommodating to my friend's food allergies. The other waitresses were also kind and attentive.

We ordered from the lunch deal menu so my friends ended up choosing a sushi (few pieces) + roll + handroll kind of combo and I ended up going with a beef shank bento box. Now from allllll my previous bento box experiences, they're generally small-ok sized meals. Rolls are usually same size as when you go for AYCE sushi and they'll give you a few pieces of tempura or you'll have some noodles. BUT, and I kid you not as I will post a picture, this place was DIFFERENT. I'd like to say they gave me salmon makies that were DOUBLE its usual size with a BIG piece of salmon in the middle!! Now we all have experienced that time when they give you a ton of rice and BARELY a good-sized piece of fish to go with the amount of rice they wanna stuff you with. Here, there is nothing to worry about! On top of that I got at least 6 pieces of veggie tempura! I don't recall ever having that many in bento boxes before! But I do admit I rarely go for the ones that have tempura...regardless, I'm not sure if all this was because we were their first customers but if this is on the regular, that's awesome!

By the end of the meal I was definitely full. Not uncomfortably but just a bit over what I expected. My friends were feeling the same way and one thing to note along with the BIG makies I got was that my friends also got a BIG slice of fish to cover each of their sushi. It was like a blanket over the rice! Same with the handrolls! I literally went O_O when I saw. The fish tasted great and fresh too! So what more can we ask for? We definitely got our money's worth for $8.99.

We also asked for tea...specifically we said green tea and we had to pay $1 for that. I wasn't sure why as I assumed tea always came with the meals...however, it didn't bother me much as everything else was perfect. I guess maybe because we said ""green tea"" and not just ""tea"" and they also gave us separate tea bags.

My issue isn't with the club, it's fine nothing great, but with the staff. I was dancing on the bar next to a randomly placed Iphone at one point. Some time later my friends and I are taken out of club to all be questioned on disappearance of before mentioned Iphone which I guess belonged to one of their bartenders. 

Several member of security said I did it and started asking me where it was??? One problem! I didn't have it! I didn't even have a purse or pockets. I was carrying a clutch and wearing a pretty skimpy dress. Well they said they had me on camera doing it and they were going to call the cops. Lets just say my night was ruined and I started crying and getting more mad. Finally some other girl confessed to giving it to someone because she almost stepped on it. What a disaster!

I could never find a time to go when it wasn't a minimum 45-minute wait...on a good day.  Though the waiting room is large, it's often standing room only.  And waiting outside in July is not exactly a nice alternative.  

I tried going first thing in the morning, it was packed with everyone who was fasting (including me).  Tried waiting until late morning.  Same.  Tried going early afternoon.  Same.  Only now I'm really hungry, and really pissed off.  And while you're sitting for that hour waiting, look to your left. This seems to be a preferred lab for all the AHCCCS gals with two in tow and one on the way.  Now look to your right.  See all those elderly folks in wheelchairs carting oxygen tanks.  You'll be lucky to have oxygen when you're their age or a wheelchair for that matter.  Look back to your left.  That's the generation that will be funding my social security someday.

The check-in process seems overly complicated.  I had my labs sent to the wrong doctor once because rather than sending them to the physician that ordered them, they went to the last doctor I saw.  I updated my address, but they sent my bill to my old address anyway.

Now, if you can find a reasonable time to go, the techs are really good here.  Fast, friendly, and they won't miss your vein no matter how small it is.  And I have much compassion for the work they do.  At my last and final visit, the tech told me ""don't take this the wrong way, but you smell so good, what are you wearing?""  Soap.

The price is incredibly reasonable and if you mention the Groupon, they'll prorate the cost if your party is less than 4. We did the ""Escape from Jail"" Room. My party of three was briefed in a holding room in the back, handed a walkie-talkie and given simple instructions before our surprising and dramatic entrance into our room.

This was the first escape room I'd done where their were not only multiple rooms to navigate through, but the rooms themselves were rigged to react to actual discoveries. You needed to figure out how to utilize your given props to navigate your way through each room like a real escape artist! 

We did have one slight malfunction in our final room, but the staff immediately entered and quickly fixed the problem without interfering with our game.

My only complaint was that there wasn't an active, visible timer, so it was hard to know our pacing, though I'm sure we could've asked. 

One thing I did really like was that in the event we did not complete the room in an hour (although we did), the Clue Masters would have walked us through the remaining challenges and obstacles until we got out. 

The parking is plentiful and convenient and the location is close to the strip and easy to find. Bathrooms are shared with the other suites in the building, so you have to request access to them after hours and be escorted through the courtyard to them.

They still have the same décor that was up 10 to 15 years ago but instead of having an inch of dust on it everything was sparkling clean. Now the booth we sat in had a small tear in the seat and the cushions sunk in a lot when you sit down but that wasn't a big deal.
I realized while looking at the menu that I had never had one of their Chimis and they claim to have invented the dish so I guess I better try one. Have to have the specialty of the house because if that is their specialty and it is no good how can anything else be.
Their salsa was really good. It had some different things added into it but it worked. I could have filled up on the chips and salsa. Good thing I didn't because the chimi was great. The sauce they put over the top of it was just great. I got the pork but next time I want to try the shredded beef. Even the rice and beans were good.

We were both super disappointed with Nando's tonight for 2 reasons-

1. They ran out of so many ingredients and veggie options. The corn was not available, but understandable since ""out of season"", but they were also out of grilled pineapples, the veggie sandwich, and the ""portobello mushroom with halloumi cheese and chilli jam"" sandwich. So my partner ended up ordering his 3rd choice - the veggie wrap - and upon delivery of the food he was told that they also ran out of one of the vegetables that is usually in the wrap. Please stock up your inventory soon, Nando's. 

2. The veggie options sucked. I don't think I have super high standards for food, not a food snob or anything, but the sad presentation/discrepancy from advertised photos and oil drenched, flavorless grilled veggies were truly disappointing. I ordered the quinoa salad, which looked amazing in a few existing Yelp photos, but tonight it was so sparse and sad looking :( There wasn't enough seeds on top and overall the quantity was much smaller than it appeared in the photos. The toppings also looked sloppily chopped and presented. I could've easily made this salad in 2 minutes myself.

The upsides-

1. No issues with seating immediately after arriving since the restaurant is so large (they also have huge communal tables -- great for groups!)
2. Friendly service

Went here for lunch and I can't get the smile off of my face.

They have 8 different dogs ranging from $4-9. Standard and Duck Fat fries for $3/5 respectively, and a soda fountain. You can read all about the menu on their website.

I had the ever popular Chili Cheese Dog to start. While not the prettiest thing to look at, it came together so well... smoked brisket chili, cheese curds on a toasted bun. About the hot dog itself, it is perfect. The casing has a nice snap to it, and the meat is super juicy and flavorful. I also feel less squeamish about eating a dog made to Kevin Sousa's specifications.

The fries were excellent. They have a ton of friers and some elaborate system of re-frying and resting the fries, resulting in a generous portion of crispy fries that range a bit in color... making everybody happy.

I then went back for the Devil Dog... egg salad, tobasco, potato chips and scallions... this time on the vegan smart dog. I've never had a smart dog before, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the natural texture and how juicy the darn thing was. It really was just a conduit for the toppings, anyhow. For vegans and vegetarians, I noticed they have a separate flat top for the smart dogs and veggie chili. I also meant to ask if the Kimchi was vegetarian or not but forgot.

The space is pretty cool, too. A high ceiling, high window diner feel. Just unfortunate that you have to stare at the business end of Target.

Service was excellent. Orders were well expedited and there are two ordering lines.

He did a great job with the cut. He was professional and really honest when I asked him advice for treating my hair. I did not give five stars because he used a lot of different chemicals to try to give volume to my hair (which it did not work) and my hair was all sticky for the rest of the day. Also it was to much chemicals that my scalp starting itching, I called him personally to see if he could wash it and blow dry it again because I paid for the service the day before and he said that it cost to do it again.. that was a huge disapointment.. maybe it is not his fault and that it is company rules.. but they should think about leaving their customers happy.

Next time I'll think about this experience to see if I'll go again or not. After all I did like the haircut! He did a really great job.

It's a really small restaurant location but super convenient for me because of where I work. There's not much parking but you can park on the Perth St. just along the side. Of course this translates to not much seating inside either so I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for large parties.. Just maybe a quick meal with a few people.

We ordered anchovy ramen which had amazing flavour.. you can DEFINITELY taste anchovies so might not be for everyone. I enjoyed it though. We also got the Shoyu Ramen. Pretty good, but one of ours had some bits of what looked like rock/sand. I think a utensil broke or maybe it really is rocks.. anyway that wasn't pleasant to bite into, but the staff were really quick to help us get a fresh bowl. We really appreciated the quick attention to remedy the situation. 

I ordered the dipping ramen. It looked really interesting so I figured I'd give that one a try. It has a nice flavour and not too salty, but oh my goodness it was VERY oily. I had a hard time eating it through all the oil (which also isn't great for digestion). Maybe you can order it with less oil?

Towards the end of the meal, a staff came by and gave us a complimentary plate of Gyoza for the troubles with the Shoyu Ramen we had. It was very kind of them! 

Price wise, this place is a bit higher than other ramen restaurants near by. But I think they do it with a lot more heart and and pride than many other mass producing chain style restaurants. 

Definitely check this place out and try for yourself.

The Soy Minced Pork with Rice was also really good.  Very saucy compared to other places and sauce is usually good thing for flavour. I found the sauce to a bit too salty, but I think it's because I only ate half the rice.

However, just today, the owner wrote me a personal email to apologize for the rude service during my past visit.  He promised they'd do better the next time out.  Based on all of the wonderful times I've had there in the past, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

5qKm5ibvMOoxz2-BV4Pc5A,RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,4,3,1,3,"After raving about this burger time and again, my husband finally took me to get one at his favorite poker spot, Binion's. He said it was hands down the best burger he's ever had, which is a bold statement coming from him. Although he tried not to get my expectations up too high, he couldn't stop talking about it, so I had to see what the fuss was about.

The first time he went he sat at the counter and had the chance to speak with the manager who told him the same man has been forming the burgers by hand for the last 45 years, which is almost as long as McDonald's has been around. The Binion's own ranch used to supply the beef, but now it comes in from elsewhere. We lucked out by not having to wait in line, which can take as long as twenty to thirty minutes during peak times (almost anytime according to my husband, Ian). We went late Sunday afternoon and were able to walk straight up to the register to order, although the place was packed when we got there. A plain burger costs $4.95 and a cheeseburger costs $5.95, fantastic deals considering what some burgers are going for these days, like the kobe burger with fois gras that costs upwards of $70 at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Mandalay Place. Ian's argument for this being the best burger is that you don't need anything special to make it taste better. He likes his burgers with cheese and only cheese, which allows him to judge burgers based on just three components - meat, bun, and cheese. Binion's Burger hits on all three cylinders. You can see the meat glisten with its own juices and fat as it sits perched on a soft and yeasty bun that tastes like the dinner rolls they used to serve at Tony Roma's. The cheese just barely sweats as it clings to the burger without running off and leaving you with a translucent film of what used to be cheese. Although I like my burgers with all the fixins, I have to agree with Ian; it's a damn good burger and definitely one of the best I've had, too.

The menu is simple but not limited to burgers, and everything is made from scratch in house. I didn't see a single person that didn't have a burger in front of them, however, so I can't vouch for the rest of the menu. The burger comes with really good potato salad, but for a dollar more you can sub it out for another form of potato, french fries. Both were great so it really just depends on what you're in the mood for. I don't like to encourage Ian to go to casinos, but in this case, I'll have to make an exception.

Tip: If you're looking for a really good deal but don't feel like a burger, head to Benny's Bullpen bar where you can get a sixteen inch pizza and a pitcher of beer for $10. Valid Mon-Fri from 5PM to 1AM and 10AM to 1AM Saturday and Sunday.",2010-04-01 22:13:24

But it just seemed like I didn't have a reason since this is such a ""special occassion"" type of place. So I was super excited when Sheryl T. organized a UYE here. I wanted to let the dinner marinate in my head a bit before writing the review (well actually, I've just been really lazy and terrible at writing reviews lately), and I'm not exactly sure what to say about it other than it was outstanding.

Most of us did the 8-course omakase. The portions are interesting, it starts out with a couple very small plates (tartare, sashimi) and you're thinking like, ""oh my god, I'm going to be so hungry after this."" But they get more substantial with some nigiri and a couple warm plates, and finally a gigantic dessert and at this point you're like, ""oh my god, that was way too much food."" Overall, the tasting menu played out nicely. My faves were the nigiri (creative, but in a way that pays homage to sushi rather than bastardizing it...not that I don't like spicy-tuna-fried-scallop-topped-with-tuna-tataki etc etc...but this is not the place for that), the miso black cod (simple, but done well), and the rock shrimp tempura (the sauce was a little heavy for me, but the shrimp itself was light and succulent in a way that I didn't know deep-fried food could possibly be).

The desserts are the same ones found on Soba's menu and as I said, they are pretty rich and ridiculous. Actually, if I had any one thing i'd change, it would be that I would prefer a lighter dessert to complement the type of food here, but that could be because I'm just not a big dessert person. But it was pretty awesome to get to try every dessert on the menu! (I guess that's what happens when six ladies go out to dinner together...haha)

I would definitely come back again, although it is very pricey so it's not so much a place to come and stuff your face with maki, and more of a birthday/anniversary/graduation/other major life event celebration spot. So, I guess I just need to find an excuse to come back. Thanks again for organizing, Sheryl!!",2012-04-15 04:13:46

-Nice views of the strip and Bellagio fountain from the rooms we stayed in. 
-Pool area is serene.
-The Eiffel tower restaurant and wedding reception dinner held there was amazing. Food 5/5. Service equally great.
-Wedding chapel was gorgeous inside. 

Cons
-The self parking garage is a joke. You walk forever to get to the actual elevators for the rooms. Not to mention the ""directory"" signs are sparse and hard to find at all. It takes a least a day to figure out how to get around.
-Elevators are grouped for different sections. If you have family staying on different floors you have to go down, switch sides and go back up.
-NO LOCKS ON BATHROOM DOORS. This is just a horrible idea.
-The fake cobblestone walkway is slippery and uneven, if you're a woman wearing heels be careful! 
-The casino in the Paris was small. Walk over to Bally's for some variety. 
-Some of the room floors allowed smoking, when you walk through them it's hard to breathe. 
-Was worried about bed bugs the whole time after reading reviews prior to leaving. We checked everything and found no sign of them and thankfully came home rash free.
-One elevator had a puddle of urine on the floor. It smelled awful.
-Drinks by the pool have alcohol added from a gun dispenser, I watched him pour and it seemed like half an ounce IF that. This is just an easy way for them to use less and charge more. 
-Finally, the pool closes at 7 p.m. every night. Is this a joke? Not that it matters, we went in the afternoon our last day there and the water was COLD. I'm not sure how they pull that off in the middle of July.

First time eating here & had the opportunity to come here due to my work Christmas lunch. As we were a large group, we were separated onto three large tables (which is understandable). 

The group menu was standard, starters: soup or salad, mains: beef, pasta or veggie dish and lastly dessert: moose or pineapple jelly.

My starters was soup which was nice but needed additional salt & pepper (which was not available)...pretty presentation but it doesn't mean anything if the soup is standard tasting.

Moving onto my mains, I ordered the beef steak. Again very pretty presentation BUT the majority of our party had ordered the steak BUT had to send it back to the kitchen...the meat was so rare it looked like it just been killed (sorry for the extreme description). 

Another point to mention was that our group was left alone with empty wine glasses on many occasions. At times, when staff were available - I had to call them over to top-up my wine glass. I believe the general rule is not to leave your guest with empty glasses!!!

Onto dessert, ordered the pineapple jelly. Again beautiful presentation and tasted good but too much of a good thing can make you sick. The pineapple jelly was a thick pineapple jelly shaving with a cheesecake tasting filling inside the shaving...not much I can say about the dessert but it was the best part of my meal.

To finish up, the group was offered tea & coffee. As I am not a coffee drinker and I was offered tea....Avoid!!!! My tea tasted like dish water....AVOID at all cost!

Besame indeed, man I was totally hungry walking into Restaurant Mexico!  This little shop down on Mill Ave.  After a few drinks or two.  This place hit the spot.  

I can't say it was the best I ever had.  However, the service was really good.  I ordered the basic taco meal with beans and rice.  Like most Mexican restaurants they offer free chips and salsa.  Salsa was good and the chips seem pretty solid in a good way.  My taco entree came quick right after I order leading me to think of it like cafeteria food.  I guess it was so quick I had in mind some lady slopping it onto my plate while smoking a cigarette.  I'm sure that's not the case.

Moreover, my tacos were good.  Nice shredded beef in a deep fried taco shell.  My favorites were the rice because they were a tad bit different from what I was used to.  Mexican rice is generally pretty bland, but here it was nice soft and sweet.  One of the best I've had I must add!

I stopped in on the bar side after attending YSB on Sunday evening. The decor is funky and eclectic. Lots of mirrors, plants, and neon lights. Beyond that there was nothing very special about his bar. Their signature giant drink was much smaller than its reputation. A limited bar menu is also available in case you don't want to drink on an empty stomac. It was relatively quiet insided so you didn't have to yell at the top of your lungs in order to have a conversation.

dt7-0kSk7-QQhMzmTuxx6w,vxRgc6S1mgXbZGXOE5nylQ,-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg,4,5,2,0,"Located in Monroeville, somewhere in the middle of Old William Penn Hwy, this place looks dilapidated and dated from outside (and also from inside). However do not let the appearances fool you, the food is delicious. You get delicacies from South India and North India, though I always return for the former (as I guess the place does that food more justice). Remember this is a PURE VEGETARIAN restaurant. 

Now being an Indian and having tried authentic local food back home in India, I can say that the South Indian food they serve comes as close (in my opinion) to legit home-cooked, mouth-watering and tantalizing food that I crave. 

This is how you can optimize your experience:

Start with the Idli- Vada combo, which includes a white cake made of rice batter and is steamed (idli), and a lentil based donut that is fried (vada). This is served with a coconut chutney and sambar (something like a vegetable stew). 

Next proceed with Mixed Vegetable Pakoras - vegetables like onions, potatoes and chillies covered with a paste of gram flour and fried, served with a mint/coriander chutney. Accompany this with a glass of Mango Lassi or regular Lassi, as you please.

The next dish should be a Dosa (rice crepe) - Rava Masala, Mysore Masala, Spring Dosa, Paneer Dosa (here the Masala is a potato mixture that is filled inside the crepe and is not very spicy as the name actually suggests), or an Uttapam (thicker version of the Dosa) - Vegetable Uttapam. 

Finish off with a Filter Coffee (made with a lot of milk and instant coffee).

Now, I do not guarantee you will be able to walk after this, but I do promise you will enjoy all that you just ate.

I bid you good eating!",2013-04-19 05:05:41

okonomiyaki which is one of my fave street snacks is pretty good here and big for the price. Its like a egg pancake filled and theirs has green onion, bacon and shrimps and has a mayo sauce and takoyaki sauce and bonito flakes on it..some places go really crazy but I think I'm glad they went more basic..I've also had takoyaki, but it was a little undercooked in the middle. Have had grilled mackerel and robata skewers and all been very nice. Gotten salty fish fried rice and udon and both were alright. Corn croquettes were good but I burned my tongue! Haha. Gotten a tonkatsu oyako don too...comfort and filling. I love egg on tonkatsu...for a while as a kid I refused to eat nothing but that.

Tempura green beans
Beef cheek bao
Singapore noodles
Ramen mac and cheese
Dan Dan Mien
Bang Bang broccoli
Nutella honey toast
Sesame balls

The dishes were hit and miss.  I'm the Singapore noodle person and I thought it needed more curry--not for heat but for more curry flavor which was just too mild for me.  The gyoza were standard.  The Bang Bang broccoli was disappointing.

On the better side, the crispy bao chicken was good as was our dish of tempura green beans.  The ramen mac and cheese was a great fusion of East and West.

I would understand it if this place sold itself as super-affordable-drunk-college-Asian food, but it's really not that cheap.

I was driving to work one day and drove right past the new place, and was so excited.  It is literally 3 minutes from my house and about 5 minutes from where I work.  Heck, I even emailed the owner to ask when it would be open.  And got a very nice email back too.  

So last Saturday, me, my daughter and my friend went in and got seated right away.  The waiter was pretty good too.  Good start

We got the fries with cheese and gravy to start.  It was ok, but most importantly, fresh, and hot.  Then our dinner came, and it was a different story.  

I got the stuffed chicken, mashed potatoes, salad and cole slaw.  My daughter got a hamburger, medium, and salad.  And my friend got meatballs, mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  My daughter's hamburger was well done, and the bun was ice cold.  The dressing on the salad was tasteless as well.  Not horrible, but definitely room for improvement.

So we have cold food and an incorrectly cooked meat.  But you know what the clencher was?  We called the owner over and told her the food was cold.  She didn't say a word, and walked away, never to return.  Didn't offer to reheat the food, maybe throw in a dessert, nothing.  But she was sure greeting people with hugs when they walked in the door, prior customers I think.   You'd think she'd work a little harder to keep new customers.  After all, wasn't that why she moved, to expand her business?

Guess what?  I live close, and also work at a very close and large office building.  We go out to lunch a lot.  You better believe I won't be back, and won't bring any of my friends and coworkers in either.   There's never an excuse for poor customer service, especially by the ""OWNER"" of the restaurant.

The service meant well -- a little slow, but friendly enough. The atmosphere was kind of cool -- kind of that well-worn Asian restaurant vibe I remember from San Francisco. Only this place doesn't really serve up ""the goods."" The sushi was lacking. Some of it was alright. But some was just...""no.""

This place has a great homey and cute feel to it with its light green walls, milk bottle vases & white painted tables and chairs.  There's plenty of seating and in the back a large communal table with a chess set & huge blackboard that covers part of a wall.  Fun! 

I ordered the latte and was disappointed that it was weak and didn't have microfoam.  It's a small thing but I guess it's a standard I have developed from going to all the other indie cafes in Toronto.

(I didn't go over and check it out, but I think that's what it was.)  Only downside is that they did very little in the way of sound design, so you're surrounded by a constant roar with even a moderate crowd - not good for conversation.

2 stars for everything else:  Beer's really not that good.  It tastes like they're rushing it - the alcohol and sweetness taste like homebrew that I open too soon, before all the flavors have settled down and the more complex ones have developed.  It makes sense to do this as a small, maybe undercapitalized, brewer, because those tanks represent a couple of thousands of dollars of malt and hops.  Best to start getting a return on them ASAP instead of keeping them stored away for a couple of weeks to finish up.  (I've tried several, but their bottled stuff comes across the same way.)

Food is all over the place.  The $9 fish sandwich is a thin slab of freezer cod fried and served on a 12"" grocery store Italian loaf with no toppings at all, and I had to ask for an extra sauce cup of Tartar sauce to have enough for any semblance of flavor.  (This was the first time in a long while that I've left food on my plate.  Granted, it was a lot of bread, but I wasn't full: I just didn't want to swallow any more of the sandwich.)

We were barely greeted by the too-hip burrito maker/cashier, but I forgive this as it was the middle of a beautiful day in Kensington market and he was stuck inside making vegan burritos. I requested an order of nachos, and two TVP burritos with guac- for myself and my omnivorous friend. The environment was a little too quiet and awkward for us to want to stay, so we took our order to go.

I would have to agree as I think the nachos were amazing. 
The TVP chunks in my burrito, I could have done without, and in fact would have almost preferred a burrito with only the fixings and none of the fake meat.

So I was waiting for this place to open for the last year as I drove by it daily on my way into work. Finally gave it a try with my wife tonight because I was craving BBQ- why was that? Because BBQ is the bomb.com.

I was quite disappointed in Cherry- enough so for this 1 star review.

Firstly, the menu is absurdly limited. No Brisket except on Friday and Saturday. Luckily it was a Friday as I was looking forward to brisket- or Perhaps unluckily as if I had come on another night I likely would have just left. I ordered the brisket special with cole slaw and corn bread, my wife had a two meet combo (chicken and pulled pork).

Firstly, on the subject of service- my wife's food came out 5 minutes prior to mine- you'd think a place would coordinate our meal together? My portion was far too small for a 13 dollar special combo as I left starving. I've reviewed other barbaque places commenting that portions were small which charged less than this and served more food. BBQ classically leaves you full and satisfied which this did not. This brisket was tender but needed sauce which did not come on or was cook on the meat. My meat was 3 star. The cole slaw was coal slaw, a little bitter which I actually enjoyed. My other annoyance with my meal was the corn bread which was jalapeño corn bread. I was not told nor are the jalapeños listed on the menu. Luckily I'm not allergic but I would not have chosen that side had I known.

My wife's meal was a better portion but the meat was of much worse quality. The chicken tasted rubbery like it came from the fast food chicken used in a mall food court. Her pulled pork had good flavor and also was 3 star pulled pork.

Both meals came with Texas toast which in my view was the best part of the meal. 

Also, what barbecue restaurant doesn't have Mac and Cheese?? I'm confused? 

For our combined food we paid 33 dollars. I might have given 3 stars had the price been half of what it is. I'd much rather have gone to Dickeys. The food is better, cheaper and more filling.",2014-12-06 01:49:48

It was my son's 14th bday and we had decided to take advantage of the last day of our season tickets. Arrived at noon and Gladys (the parking goddess) was on my side. We wanted to sit by the wave pool this time but couldn't find a perfect spot so we ended up on the grass, shaded tree and perfect view of the Canyon Cliff slide. It wasn't crowded and didn't come across any bees! I get worried about the bees when I come here. But still, I bought season tickets and I'm not wasting it. This day couldn't be more perfect. 

Overall for this season:

1. Get those bees under control! On all occasions we were here except for the last day, we had to keep changing our spot due to bees. We bought food and that made it worse. We couldn't finish our food and had to toss it or risk getting stung. That is NOT going to happen again, if you read my past reviews. 

2. Buy a super brella- I now prefer a spot on the grass next to a tree. 

3. The Tornado is our favorite family ride. 

4. There's a bar (hello beer)! I haven't bought alcohol here but my husband and I have hung out there while waiting for the boys. The seats are comfy and next to our ride the Tornado. 

5. On our last day, my husband decided not to join us on the Tornado ride so the boys and I had to carry the tube by ourselves to the top and it was very obvious we were having a hard time. We had to let some people pass cause we were so slow. An employee was nice enough to carry the tube for us the rest of the way. What a gentleman! I also have to add that there was a man who was already carrying a tube for his family and still offered to help us. Love places where people are so kind. 

6. The wave pool is not as much fun compared to other water parks we've been to and we love water parks. We love the water and just being out in the sun. I buy so much sunscreen that I buy them online in bulk. Btw, they offer free sunscreen here. 

7. I'm the kind of person that resist change but I'm seriously considering Cowabunga next time. We've never been there and really want to see the difference. I heard the water is warmer there too, although I've never had any complaints with the water at Wet'n'Wild. We shall see...

However this time around, I'm giving it a 4 stars! woohoo!

SERVICE
BRAD IS DA BOMB! My server Brad made sure our evening was delightful.  
- He was always there when we needed him
- he never pushed us into ordering faster
- he let us stay as long as we wanted 3.5hrs on a Thursday night (keep in mind we had 10 ppl who kept ordering drinks, food, dessert, drinks)
- he was very flexible with our receipts, fast with taking our orders and delivering our food. and so much more!

FOOD
I just ate a dessert b/c by the time I'm finished with my meal, I can't even begin to think about dessert. My dessert was $4.99 for this fairly big cup of ice cream with brownies and oreos. delicious.

But what was fantastic was that Pickle Barrel allows you to bring your own cakes w/o charging you additional fees and so of course I brought my home made cake for my friend for her b-day.  Brad was so kind to put it in the fridge for us and give us additional plates and cutlery at the end of our meal (prolonging our time using the tables).

BOOTHS
What I liked best is the layout of the restaurant. It felt like we were in our own little room/booth and so we didn't hear other ppl's conversation.

What I found a bit ridiculous was that my friend received a phone call from Pickle Barrel and the women on the phone (who sounded a bit peeved said"" ""I'm sorry, but your reservation has been cancelled b/c you and your guests are not here"" but in fact we were sitting at our table already ordering.

Then, the girl at the register asked me if I wanted to try a sample. Well, of course I did! She gave me a sample of the sweet dew fresh milk tea. I ordered it. See? Samples do work. In case you're wondering, sweet dew tastes oddly like mild coconut.

My first car was a 1958 Chevy Impala. My air conditioner went off. Being a senior, and a woman, I brought my car to Fairway hoping for a decent repair and price. I said to change the oil with synthetic oil, and a lube job. They called me within 20 minutes in the rental truck, stating my ball and pinion were leaking, and my tie rod was going out. That it would cost $350.00. I said ok. That was Friday. On Monday I called, they told me it would be $1800.00 plus the cost of the A/C. Oil and lube. Then they tried to charge me for a diagnostic of 150.00 for the ball and pinion. The head of service took that charge off. Now, my car is making a noise it never made before. 4 years ago I brought my car here and they told me I needed a new transmission and a compressor. Needless to say, this is/was not true. I did not believe them then, and now, when I purchase a new car, I am sad to say, it will not be from Fairway Chevrolet again. My car has 82,000 miles, of gentle driving to work and back. I had to give a star for getting me into a rental truck at a great price. The whole thing is, now my car makes a noise that is getting worse daily. I will be finding some where else for my car now. I don't trust Fairway any more.so it cost me over 1000.00 to get oil change, and new motor for the A/C. Motor was 250.00 and labor was 325.00. Just for the ac motor. Then 80.00 rental. Such an expense to receive my car back making new noises. Very disappointed and sad. This was where I all these years purchased my car in 2004, paid it off payment by payment, never late. To be treated like this is just so disappointing. I would NEVER recommend Fairway to anyone ever again! By the way, no car wash at all. There is one, but they did not wash mine.

The (assumed) manager tonight was looking for any reason not to honour the program, even after being advised what the program is and how it is redeemed.

Though, we don't always buy here (the prices are much higher than Adidas overall), it's worth stopping by to see the shoe selection, especially when they are on sale (like shox). The ones along the wall in the boxes without tops are on clearance. 

When we went on saturday afternoon, it was an extra 20% off the clearance shoes and an additional 30% off the clearance clothing (maybe this was a weekend promotion?). Plus, we had saved our coke reward points for months and had gift cards to burn (a win-win). We had already checked the Nike Outlet @ Premium/North a few days earlier. There was a much larger selection here. Men's shoes are to the left of the store, while women's are to the right of the store, and children's are to the far right of the store. There are lots of benches with the try-on socks below and mirrors are all over too. I found six pairs to try on, and was stuck between two comfortable pairs (since the others weren't really my colors). I chose the black pair @ $39.99. My husband was stuck between two pairs as well, though one was a little out there (kinda reminded me the Jim Carrey movie, ""The Mask"" except the majority was like a smurf blue color and it was some weird material too) so he kept asking me if it was funny, and I told him ""yeah, but if you like it, what does it matter?"" He chose the latter pair (red, black and white) after all this. The young man assisting my husband was very nice, volunteering to get him a different size. 

We didn't look at the other sections because we each really wanted a pair of shoes. Even though there is a lot of selections and many customers, it wasn't very messy (ie. boxes of shoes lying around). Overall, this is a clean store and the shoes are organized/well stocked. Checkout was fast and the cashier was pretty nice too. After all that, we still have a balance left, on our gift cards, which does not expire. Back to collecting all those coke reward points...

I can't imagine anything tasting bad, but the beef in our beef tacos was kinda fatty. The pork & fish tacos were excellent. 
My only real complaint and the reason I deducted one star is the price (and the spice factor. If you have someone in your party that has a weak mouth...skip this place). Dinner for two; Guac sampler, 3 different taco plates and one margarita...over $65 not counting tip. It's just tacos. They're delicious but they are just tacos.

Although the parking garage could use a major overhaul (what a dump!).  When I walked into the casino, I didn't feel like I was Downtown.  There wasn't that old, smoky smell and you could immediately tell that this place has been remodeled recently.

The long bar takes up the first wall you see, and it is definitely long!  There was plenty of seating and lots of tvs, and a decent selection of beers on tap.  The bartenders were friendly and the service was quick.

I didn't do any gambling, but it is hard to miss that there are go-go dancers in the pit.  I will never understand the allure of this, but then again, I am female.  They seemed to have a wide selection of table games with decent limits (per usual Downtown).

Upstairs I felt like I struck gold.  The D has 1 of only 2 Sigma Derby horseracing games in Las Vegas.  It's seriously old school - it only takes quarters (luckily there is a cashier cage nearby that will give you a roll of quarters so you can play).  This isn't a machine where you win a lot of money, it's just fun and something different.

The highlight of the hotel is their new Italian Steakhous - Joe Vicari's Andiamo.  The ambiance is very nice, the service is amazing and the prices can not be beat.  I highly suggest checking this place out if you get a chance (review for the restaurant coming shortly).

The only good thing about the parking situation is that the players club will validate your ticket so you receive 4 free hours of parking.  And I didn't even have to sign up for a players card!

I went here based upon several 5-star ratings, but I just wasn't excited about this place.  
At around 5pm on a Tues, I ordered the tri-tip and pork ribs combo, with mac-n-cheese, can ice tea, spicy sauce, cornbread disk, about $15.93+tip.

The trip tip was a bit fatty, it did have a thin smoke ring, and maybe a 6oz portion.  it was cooked through, no pink.  Maybe it had sat for a while in the warmer, maybe not, but I was surprised at the fatty bits.  Usually, slow cooked tri tip has none or very little.  The three or four pork ribs were appropriately moist, but all the meats were bland enough to need the BBQ sauce.  

The BBQ tomato sauce was ordered spicy, but needed more heat.  Thick, not watery at all.  

Mac-n-cheese, looked like they're using a cheese that dries up after warming, tasted like they use Oxaca style, so not much cheddar or velveeta detected.  Noodles were done well, most were whole.  

Cornbread was moist and buttery, needed no sauce or additional garnishment.

I have eaten here twice now, and while it's not as crowded (major plus), I still prefer the original in Point Breeze.

The menu is very similar (almost a little too similar) to that at Point Brugge. A notable addition is the tarte flambée, a French-style flatbread. Very good (I got the classic preparation, with ham, caramelized onions, and crème fraiche) but nothing mind-blowing. I'd get it again if I was sharing with a group, but I wouldn't find myself craving it. They also have poutine, which I have yet to try, but the frites with roasted garlic aioli were just as good as their Point Brugge counterpart. I actually think I may prefer the aioli to the basil mayo!

As for the mussels, which are always a must, I had to try the new preparation with Maytag Bleu and Andouille Sausage. Again, liked it, but mind wasn't blown.

NOT badly average: ZIN BURGER!

I've had a long time coming around to Sam Foxes restaurants and to be honest with you, I don't know why.  ""North"" is terrific, their Italian restaurant and any of their North locations and Zin Burger is just a terrific burger.  ABSOULTELY TERRIFIC.

I've said before in other reviews, when I first go to a burger joint, I get a standard burger.  It's like the marinara at an Italian restaurant; it speaks volumes.  If I taste the spaghetti sauce at an Italian restaurant, and it tastes like Chef Boyardee, there's no reason to try the rest of the menu.  An Italian friend of mine used to say, ""How's the gravy?"", and he wasn't talking brown gravy.  So, my first time at Zin, I got the basic burger, the Samburger: applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, lettuce and 1000 Island.  I can't say it any other way or stronger: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  

Say it again: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  

Because this burger was...IS so good! I have no idea about the flavors of the other burgers.  Never had 'em.  Never ordered anything other than the Samburger.  Why would I?  I found a great burger.  I have to assume they're just as good, in their own way, in their own flavor.

Looking at the menu just now, I've noticed an Angus Beef Sloppy Joe...I could try that!  I could probably be talked into their Bleu Cheese Burger...but then I wouldn't have a Samsburger...

And just so you don't think from my sub-standard review of Hop Doddy, that price is most important, it isn't; this burger, even with the bacon already on it, is $2 too much...and, by God, it's worth it!

I find the staff's at both Biltmore/Chandler to be very friendly, well-trained (except for the waitress at Chandler who said, and I'm quoting, ""...you cannot get e-coli at Zin because we grind out own beef"".  Sorry, baby.  That's got nothing to do with e-coli.)

Almost forgot: the fries.  Let me just say this: I like regular fries and not for $6 or $7 bucks.  The standard fries here are excellent, $5.  Save the room, eat the half your dining companion couldn'f fidn

I wasn't too impressed with the drinks/bartenders the night I was there. I had to create my own drink. Normally, you can give an experienced bartender a direction you want to go (a couple of spirits/mixers you like) and they can suggest a drink from the menu or craft something specifically for you. The bartenders that night appeared unable or unwilling to do either. So, I gave them a specific list of ingredients...which came out pretty good actually (patting myself on the back).

We tried some bites from the menu too. They were all appetizers, but they were all very tasty. Nothing too filling, as we all shared them; but it did whet my appetite. I wouldn't be opposed to returning for a full meal. This seems like it might be a good place for a Happy Hour too (although that isn't when I visited).

Also, the second time I came here with my husband and dog.  The manager came over to us and said dogs were not allowed, but would allow us to stay that time.

1: Excellent, knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly service. 
2: Unbeatable pricing. Yeah, I do a lot of research into the products I buy and that includes pricing. Even with Clark County's Sales Tax figured in Vegas Discount Nutrition has the best prices on most of their products. This is based on essentially 3 years of research on protein powder alone and it's still as true today as it was when I wrote my first review. 

If you are one of those people that knows about the suppliers that produce whey for example, you know the technical differences in the products. And the staff knows it too and if you come in here and ask them technical questions, you will get straight forward, no BS answers. When it comes to supplements they are helpful, but I've got over 20 years of knowledge on supplements and I trust my research over the staff opinions as that's one small area they don't have as much expertise on. Stick to the protein powders and other stuff they sell and the staff won't steer you the wrong way. (Also check out the protein drinks in the cooler...I buy that stuff by the case here).

They have some solid dishes like Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Chang's Spicy Chicken (their version of General Tso's).  I love their Hot & Sour soup, and our family still remembers the first time they tried their Lettuce Wraps and Dan Dan noodles.

But over the years, it seems PF Changs has become a caricature of itself  Sometimes the service is good, as it was today.  Other times, it just seems as if the waitstaff is new and has never worked in a restaurant before. See Gabi's review from three years ago. Also, sometimes the food can be off, ie: dried or not hot rice, etc.  I'll end it here, since it looks like I've used up my allotment of the word 'sometimes'.

So, Three Stars ""A-OK"".  But, they're on my Watch List for a possible downgrade.",2013-04-18 20:09:44

Very good broth in that pho. I had a large bowl of the number one ""everything"" version (complete with tripe). The meat had been cooked long enough to be tender. The spring rolls were good but not that far above average.

Perhaps one of the best indications of a good ethnic restaurant: There were plenty of customers of the ethnicity in question. 

Service was very good. The spring rolls came out almost immediately as an appetizer, which differs from many other places I've been.

Having been open since at least 2002 -- there is an article on the mens room wall from that year -- it is easy to see why.  When looking for this restaurant, it is very easy to pass it by since it is in a non-descript building off of Carson with small, curvilinear writing on the glass that is somewhat difficult to make out from afar.  I stumbled upon this little gem by happenstance.  The name, while an odd pun, is rather amusing.

The interior is straight forward with a modern color scheme (yellow, blue, red, white) that is demarked by the walls, ceiling, and the register.  It is a very intimate atmosphere that exuded a warmth and that I was quite comfortable dining in.  After cruising through the menu, we decided on the following items:

Steamed dumplings with tamarind sauce
Wonton soup
Basil Leaf chicken (6/10 piquancy)
Pineapple curry with chicken (6/10 piquancy)

The dumplings were the first items to arrive and they do not look like any dumplings I have ever seen.  I figured this was the Thai aspect of this dish arising and went for them while dipping in the Black Tamarind dipping sauce.  I wasn't very happy with this item.  The dumplings were somewhat rubbery, the filling had an aromatic that was out of balance and the tamarind sauce did nothing to wed the disparate items.  I tried adding some chile paste to the tamarind sauce, but it did not help.  If you are not used to tamarind, I would stay away from the sauce.  I enjoy tamarind candies and tamarind nectar but still thought that the sauce was a bit odd.

As we finished our appetizer, the soup arrived.  It didn't look like any wonton soup nor smell like any wonton soup that I had ever seen.  The aromatic herbs were forefront in anything that I could smell -- yes, this was true Thai.  As I took my first sip of the soup I was pleasantly surprised at how the flavors in the broth could all be independently tasted while being accented with the aromatic basil.  The wontons completed the flavor bouquet in my mouth.  The only oddity about this soup for me was that the noodles had a buttery aura about them.  I still cannot understand why that is.

As we waited for our entrees, I noticed that the kitchen door was open.  I watched for a few minutes and saw them cutting fresh vegetables and herbs while putting the fresh ingredients together.  It was finally our time to receive our entrees.  The smell was wonderful.  The Basil Leaf comes by default at a 6/10 on the piquancy scale.  This balances the underlying sweetness in the garlic sauce quite nicely.  The chicken kept its own flavor while picking up the flavor of the sauces as a compliment.

The Pineapple Curry was very good.  Normally it comes at a 2/10 on the piquancy scale; I upped the piquancy to a 6/10 for my own personal pleasure.  The flavors were quite good.  The pungency of the coconut milk, the sweet and sour flavor of the pineapple, the medly of flavors from the curry, and the piquancy mixed together danced in my mouth.  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  At no point was the piquancy too great to handle.

The rice for both of the dishes was a little dry, but at no point was it crunchy.  It is difinitely made to be eaten with the curries and the dishes that are served with ample amounts of sauce.  In the end, we wound up eating for $16 per person and neither of us were able to finish our entrees.  I would think that two people could easily split one entree, especially if they are having an appetizer.

The one common trait that you will notice permeating the entire experience that is Borealia is a fantastic attention to detail. From the copper sheet borealis light fixture (clever!), to the tasty cocktails, to the nuanced flavours in all their dishes - no detail has been overlooked, no effort has been spared.

Starting with the appetizers, there are 3. I will make it easy for you. Get all three! You won't regret it. 

Best Appetizer: The real standout was the deviled Chinese tea eggs with sweet soy. The addition of Chinese sausage on the top really paired nicely with the sweet soy, the perfect balance of sweet and savory - reminded me ever so slightly of maple bacon.

Most Visually Interesting: The mussels came in a pine needle smoked-filled cloche that was opened table-side. The scent was fantastic, and will conjure up cozy memories of campfires. The real scene stealer of this dish though was the pine ash butter sauce the mussels are served with. I would strongly recommend you pair the mussels with an order of the red fife bread to soak up all the leftover saucy goodness. 

WARNING: Now about this red fife bread + butter combo. If you are someone who has had problems with substance addiction in the past, tread carefully. The buttery half of this app is sprinkled with a powdered caramel onion concoction that I can only assume is cocaine based. It is too ridiculously good. You will have to resist the urge of spooning butter directly to mouth (or don't - I'm not judging).

XY Top Pick: Get the whelk. This was the standout dish for me. I'm pretty sure when the Greek's talk about ambrosia, they are talking about the beurre blanc that fills the shell the whelk was served in. Nectar of the butter gods!
Runner-up was the pigeon + squab pie.

XX Top Pick: The gf knows a thing or two about pierogies, and this dish was making it happen for her. Would recommend you have the pigeon pie and chase that with the pierogies. The pierogies provide a nice, light, counter-point to the heavyweight dish that is the pigeon pie. Good way to end the nomnom train.

Desserts: I'll keep this short. Like the appetizers, just get all 3.
- Louisbourg beignets: Do it already! They are outstanding and taste exactly like the description reads. Burnt my tongue eating these and I'd gladly do it again. Sorry tongue!
- Apple Tart: More like a tasty, slightly thicker apple sauce than a sorbet. Fantastic crunchy oatmeal bottom. Flavour and differences in texture were fantastic. Scraped that cup clean!
- Bavarois Strawberries: Totally not what we were expecting from the description. It's very light and airy. The Madeira gel on the top is not a pairing I expected but it totally worked.

Thirsty? Drink liberally of the Sorrel Switched cocktail. It's delicious and a must if you are a fan of ginger beer like I am. Not sold yet, talk to Jason the bartender -  knowledgeable and friendly, he'll take care of you.

Repeat? Duh! Thanks for upping the food-game in T.dot Borealia!",2014-12-25 05:01:32

The boutique has some great sales!  I always check out the sales rack and sweater bins.  The bakery has FRESH dog treats, many are meat-based and my dog loves everything they make.

Advice:
-Call a couple days ahead for appointment, especially if you want a Saturday groom.  This place is booked full on some days.
- Don't pay the extra $10 for the ""Teachers Pet"" package.  I did this a few times thinking my little dog would be happier hanging out with the groomer instead of being in a cage.

We mentioned it to the skill lacking server and she said she was ""sorry about that"". She got one plate removed from our bill but told me I had eaten to much of mine to have the manager remove it.

I made a reservation but in the back of my head thought ""It's Monday night I probably don't need a reservation"". Wrong.

Our server was great. She was well versed in the menu and answered our questions with ease. She was right there when we needed refills and non-existent when appropriate. One note about the menu from our server was on the brussels sprouts. She told us that even people that don't like sprouts like the ones here. My wife doesn't like brussels sprouts but we ordered them. Our server was right. My wife said they tasted like french fries.

To start we tried the house pickles. They're only slightly brined and still quote crunchy. They don't make you pucker. They're also served with carrots and a slice of jalapeno pepper. So overall there's just a slight amount of heat.

For dinner my wife had the steak and I went with the bison brisket. We tried each other's meals and both were excellent. For sides we had the sprouts, as mentioned, and the Charcut potatoes. The portions are a good size for the (higher) dollar. 

Lastly we shared a sticky toffee pudding with bourbon gelato. When they say bourbon, they mean bourbon so be prepared if that's not your drink because its right in your face.

Appies run from $8-17. Meals are in the low $30's but the bison brisket will run you $42 at the highest end. The couple of beers I had were $9 each.

So, when I tried Poke again in Toronto (at a different location), I was rather disappointed by the stingy portion size and high price point. Since then, I have been on the hunt for good Poke. Now behold the Poke Box, it offers fresh bold flavors with generous serving size. This place is in the Financial District, making it very convenient for everyone working downtown. The décor of Poke box is minimalist and clean. Poke Box offers two sizes to choose from, regular and large. I picked the classic salmon on half rice half zucchini noodles, along with other fresh toppings. One thing that makes them stand out is the fact that they offer zucchini noodles as a base if you are on a low carb diet. All the ingredients in the box were fresh and flavorful. I am very happy to have found Poke Box. Will definitely be returning!",2017-05-17 19:01:56

It's quaint and personal and when I was there, the noise level was pretty low (I feel like it could get out of hand in such a tiny area) and peaceful. I had the scrambled eggs and herbs. I have no idea what herbs were in there, but they were simply perfect. The portion was good because I can't eat loads of greasy eggs (well...I can, but I wasn't hurting from the night before; if I were in less than perfect shape that morning, I would have been somewhere else--ahem, Inn on Coventry--with eggs benedict, grits and OJ) and the flavor was very light as was the texture (I gag on slimy eggs pretty easily). 

I also got a chai latte, which was good too! Though, they use the Tazo pre-mixed stuff, which isn't the best, but I still like it. And, being a bit of a coffee snob since I work and have worked in coffee for a long time, I was really happy with my foam on top ;)

Their sweet and sour pork here is really good. I like it when they fry it fresh to order so that when it comes to the table, the sauce drizzled on it will make it tasty but the crunch is still there! Other places usually fry it ahead of time and the crunchiness of this dish is not there. 

The curry crab is worth ordering too. If you want the crab presented nicely on top of a candle lit fire to keep the crab warm but also has a nice presentation, this dish might be a dish to get some ooos and ahs from your guests. 

The pork neck meat with mushrooms and snow peas is another great dish. Stir fried it to the right taste and balance of oil because these dishes can be oily. Don't worry, pork neck meat is not that scary, if you try the meat out, you'll love it. It's the fattier part of the pig and the meat is tender and juicy. 

The other dishes are great too but not worth the extra mention because it tasted similar to other Chinese restaurants I've been to. The seafood dishes we ordered tasted really good though. 

The restaurant itself is huge with huge chandeliers and a big tv screen on one of the walls. The place is like a banquet hall so a wedding party can be held here. 

LAST TIP?!

Come with a big party (like 10 ppl) to try out their banquet dinners at reasonable prices. Go home full and satisfied. But if you don't have that many ppl, still order a crab dish. The curry crab served with a candle on the bottom (like a fondue) is worth ordering!",2017-11-24 02:12:41

A couple friends recommended their happy hour, saying the 5 dollar vodka drinks and 5 dollar sliders were awesome, so we decided to check it out with a group of us looking for just that, drinks and appetizers. The afternoon we stopped by the bar was full, and the ""Red Tables' they designate for happy hour were pretty much full. There was enough room for about half of us to sit down and order drinks. The wait staff did their best by bringing a couple more chairs to put on the ends of the tables, but there just wasn't enough room for a party of 12 to sit down and enjoy cheap vodka drinks and burgers. We did not want to order food if the seating arrangements were not going to work out. The drinks we had were very good by the way, and the servers were fast and friendly with the drinks and our check when we decided to move on. 

The rest of the tables in the bar area were empty, but they said they were for customers who were dining from the dinner menu, not the happy hour menu. Looking at the prices on their dinner menu, I can see that's where they are trying to make money. So why offer such an enticing happy hour, that runs longer than other bars and restaurants, if you can't accomodate the crowd?

I got love for Edison's. Some great musicians have played here, one of them being Guitar Man. You can usually catch him on 25th now, dressed in a mask and cape, playing songs off of his up and coming cd. They're not too bad, he's a very talented man. 

The place is a house turned into a bar, still an upstairs to it, I believe it may be in use too. I could never live upstairs from a bar. Maybe it's not, don't take my word for it. The back patio, is brick-layer, has grape vines providing protection from a light drizzle, if that's not enough, there's a shell of the garage still standing with tables under it. There's a dart board for outside entertainment, a porch is also there as soon as you walk out. A cool water fountain is also back there. It's own little world exists back there. 

Connected to the bar is the pizza shop, accessible from  the front or inside the bar. This pizza is some of the best in Cleveland, actually I'm gonna go so far as to say it is the best. Honey packets available upon request, I think they even charge 25 cents nowadays! which is bullshit! but worth it. There's always local artists, photographers work posted up for sale. You can catch some real cool paintings, drawings, or photos here. 

Great beer selection. Fruity, fancy, or cheap, they got what you need. I have so many great memories in this place, some have no place in Yelp.

I also bought bok choy, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms, purple yam, peeled garlic, hot pot base seasoning, squid, baby octopus, wonton wrappers and a number of other items to put in my hot pot that I will be enjoying soon.

My favorite thing to buy there has been the fresh jackfruit ... it makes for a healthy snack and they have a really good selection of it. I've also found dried jackfruit chips --- so good.

The ambience was refined and added to the quality of the experience.  We dined at the new L'Etoile last week and had a thoroughly disappointing experience.

We were seated at a round booth table without a tablecloth in a location cut off from diners in the front and upstairs dining areas.  The booth table was reminiscent of corner booth tables at Perkins!  The server had to ask a couple of diners to hand plates to her because she could not reach over the expanse to get the plate.  To make matters worse, when asked why the table had no cloth, she responded that management was considering removing tablecloths from all tables for ecological reasons and because laundry often returned cloths without stains thoroughly removed.

With the exception of a couple of mid-courses and a cheesecake dessert, all diners felt the food was not up to previous standards.  The third courses were remarkable for lack of memorable flavor and the pasta with seafood was bland and flavorless.  The market cut ribeye came out as a very large slab of meat sprinkled with a few frites.  There was little that was subtle about the dish.  The amuse, a liquified cottage cheese concoction, was the flavor highlight of the meal.

However, if those are not your favorite, then there are definitely better AYCE values in Las Vegas. 

AYCE at Hikari is $26, and if you are looking to stuff your face with sashimi and oysters, I think you will get your dollars worth, but given that most AYCE is closer to $22, if you are looking for creative rolls, you should definitely go elsewhere. The actual rolls at Hikari are a bit substandard with the showpiece being 5 different variations on a shrimp tempura roll. Imitation crab is abundant. Roll-eaters are definitely subsidizing the sashimi-feasters.

The staff is definitely friendly. The sushi chefs are all smiles and the banter back and forth between the chefs and the kitchen is entertaining. However, I personally do not enjoy the high pressure sushi bar set-up. If you go for sushi, you will more than likely end up sitting at the sushi bar because the tables are for steakhouse customers, and you have to deliver your order verbally to the sushi chefs, who then announce the order. I know this is the sushi bar vibe, but I just feel judged when I order my fifth cucumber salad. (People, I like cucumbers.) 

To make matters less than pleasant, there are also fluorescent lights to deal with. I just could not get comfortable jammed at the sushi bar meekly ordering cucumber salads and feeling guilty that I was not really putting my dollar to use because I was not gulping down raw tuna. I do appreciate the ""raw"" appeal, but I think I appreciate a more well-rounded AYCE experience more.",2010-02-01 20:27:08

k9KudZeY5mMOv75NWFKeIg,Q83R2UssCoErEJX36wrlvg,8nmjvYX4N67cxOsGfbEgjg,3,1,1,1,"This place is quite new and so a lot of things could still use a lot of improvement. We first tried this place as part of a Yelp event. The Yelp team did a great job in organizing everything, but the rest of the experience was mediocre at best. 

At the event they had a lot of menu options to try, which was good, since that way we could try a lot of things instead of having to eat a plateful of the same stuff. The blue margaritas and the Redd's Apple Ale were good. The appetizers were okay on an average but the bbq chicken pizza / flat bread was really good, as were the shrimp, crabcakes and quiche. The ribs and coconut chicken was worse than average (my boyfriend loved the taste of the coconut chicken though, but I just thought it was too dry). Overall the hors d'eouvres event went well, with the alcohol and the appetizers flowing. I didn't get a chance to try the Cupcake wine because I wanted to stay awake for the movie but after reading the other reviews, I kinda wish I did.

It all started going downhill after that though. During the movie I ordered a black bean burger for the entree (we just ordered one between me and my boyfriend since we filled up on the appetizers) which took forever to arrive. It didn't feel that bad since we were distracted by the movie, but it must have taken at least half an hour for the food to get to us. After that, I was dismayed at how it was served. It came in a bowl, along with the sides (fries) and a smaller bowl of ketchup. I've never been served a burger in a bowl before. Needless to say, when I picked up what I thought was the whole burger, all that I could pick up was the top bun and the patty, partly because of how high the burger was. And I'm terribly sorry to say this but it completely failed in taste, lacked flavor and was really dry. I wish we could have ordered something more (the smoked bacon and gouda burger?) to see if they did better overall and just the black bean burger was what was wrong. Also, the servers seemed really unsure of themselves, but I guess that's because the place is new and they are still on the learning curve.

My boyfriend also noticed that the speaker system was off. The surround sound was fine, but the main front speaker where most of the voices came from was way distorted and quiet (those are his words, unfortunately I don't notice such things).

We decided to give them a second try when my boyfriend's parents were in town. The servers are just as confused about the entire layout as I remember. Something that was ordered by someone sitting in row J or K was first brought up to us (all the way back in row M) and when we said we didn't order it, they finally found the seat that ordered it. And this wasn't a one time thing, they kept bringing orders to the wrong seats and/or asking people if they received their orders or were still waiting for it. As it is, it was a distraction to have the servers walk around the place, and on top of that I don't want them bothering me when I haven't even ordered anything and am just trying to watch the movie.

I really hope they get a little more organized system in place to serve people or at least have their servers familiarize themselves with the layout. I also suspect the whole taking orders on iPod touch isn't quite working as well as they hoped it would, but oh well, what do I know?

Oh by the way, when you get your ticket validated, make sure it has the extra validation bar codes. My boyfriend gave the parking ticket to the lady at the box office to get it validated and she probably ran it through the machine, but it didn't actually print the validation bar codes. We didn't realize it till we handed the ticket to the lady at the ticket booth while exiting the parking and she asked for $10 saying the ticket wasn't validated. Very careless move, SMG.",2013-03-25 15:02:44

The six of us were seated immediately at large picnic table on the patio. We decided to split 3 large orders of meat and two sides a piece. Our eyes might have been bigger than out stomach. We were all stuffed and we still had a few small left overs.

Wings and pulled pork were definitely the favorites. Large crispy wings with good flavor and very juicy. Tender, moist pulled pork with a little sauce on top and extra on the side. We had the kimchi spare ribs as well. They were good and tender, but for $ 6-7 more than most of the other meats, I probably won't get it again.

As for sides we ordered the potato swirl, Pimento cheese with shrimp chips, Bao Buns, Ramen mac n cheese, spicy cracklins ( pork rinds with siracha dust). The swirl was good, but very small. Buns serve a good vessel to shovel the vast quantities of meat in. Pimento cheese was very tasty and good for sharing. Ramen was not that good, cracklins are good but nothing special.

But it's ok, because the other hand serves up delicious and original breakfast options!

The Junction is a bit out of the way, but a fun area to visit.  
This place is a casual eatery, popular with locals.

I didn't expect it to be cafeteria style. It doesn't look like cafeteria style, the seating area is nice, you just have to order at the front.  Which makes me feel a bit rushed, which is fine for lunch but not really my preferred style of brunch.

The specials are awesome. The French toast was sold out, so I went for the lamb sausage omelet  with almond pesto with sweet potatoes with buttered light rye.

The food was very tasty.  The eggs were delicious and flavorful, a bit runny and soft, perfect with the toast.  Complex tasting breakfast for a venue that looks so simple.

I did find the food a bit pricey for the small portions with a simple orange slice for garnish.  And perhaps the staff had a hard shift, but there's wasn't a friendly smile to be seen.

The oldest bar interior in Phoenix, it has the original 1950-something Tiki interior. It is dark and cozy, but not stuffy.
The patrons are a mixed bunch, local grubby older guys who ride their bikes there, local business people who know what is hip, rockabilly, punk rock, hippies, young, old, Mexican, American, you get the idea, it is an eclectic mix.
The pool table is always being used, the bar nearly always full, but you can usually find a stool and a table or sit at one of the booths.
The two bartenders are a little rough around the edges, but both women are real sweethearts. And the prices are lower than anywhere except home. But you won't get the cool Tiki interior or great people watching there.
I like in a neighborhood close to the Bikini, so we frequently take a walk over for some drinks. The Bikini is always a good time. I recommend it if for nothing else, the experience and the nostalgia. Not much of what Phoenix was before the strip malls and subdivisions, so it is nice to have this little piece of history still going strong (quietly, but strong).

In our opinion, the owner routinely makes inappropriate comments that border on rudeness. On one occasion, we arrived at 7 PM and the owner essentially warned us that he would kick us out at 8 PM sharp implying that we were going to stay there for an hour as if we don't have anything better to do than hang out in his restaurant for an hour.  When you compliment the restaurant or food, he is never grateful and is rather self-congratulatory, making comments like ""Yeah we are the best""

Previous reviews regarding table arrangements reflects our experience. They will often have ""reserved"" signs on certain tables during times when the restaurant is empty. The tables are not reserved but they don't want smaller parties occupying their larger table even if you may need the additional space.

They also nickel and diming has also gotten out of hand. They charged us for water in a to go a cup after we had already paid them and tipped them $5 (yes on a takeout order).  We are loyal customers but we just have not been shown the same level of respect and professionalism that you would think we would be given. 

Regarding the food, many of the criticisms ring true for us. The pita is often served cold and is chewy. They stopped serving a spicy hummus which was delicious. The kebab used to come out sizzling and tender. Now, it's often served room temperature and lacks flavor. I agree the falafel is over-fried and comes out almost burned at times. This restaurant is just nothing remotely what it was when it first opened. It is a tragedy because we used to really enjoy this place.

I don't like my drinks that sweet, so I generally ask for no additional sugar, as the toppings they have are usually sweetened too.  I also tend to get my drinks with no ice so it's not diluted. 

The review:

Royal Milk tea with pearls (and I added grass jelly) - no ice, no added sugar -  This was pretty good.  I liked the texture of the grass jelly, but it wasn't as soft or slurpable as the grass jelly at Chatime.   Even though I didn't get extra sugar added, it was decently sweet.   With no ice, the drink wasn't diluted at all and it tasted quite nice and balanced.   I wouldn't mind getting this again.  

Brown Sugar Oolong Milk Tea w/ 2 jellies ( coffee jelly and pearls) - Even though I asked for no additional sugar, I think the coffee jelly is steeped in so much sugar syrup that the drink was SO overly sweet.   While the coffee jelly was nice in texture, I had to water my drink down with 2x in water and milk just for it to be drinkable.  For my sugar sensitive palette, I would never get this one again.     On the upside, it was flavourful.   

My 2 drinks came out to $6.44 for with the BOGO offer.   I'm still more attracted to Chatime's large roasted milk tea with grass jelly....and that's only $4.70 before taxes.   For $6 or I can go to Nohonhon and get some excellent made on the spot matcha lattes with upgraded ceremonial matcha.   This is slightly on the more expensive side and the more sweet side.   But yes if you don't mind the sugar content and price, the quality of their tea is quite good, the location downtown is quite convenient as well.

They have an interesting hidden/trap door that leads to the basement.  It looks just like a wall until you lean in.     Over the course of waiting for my order .....the staff had to point and yell whenever someone needed to use the bathroom.

But we will not return for many reasons, and I think that those reasons explain my rating.  When you approach the building, the window reads ""gluten free"", ""organic"", ""non-GMO"" and lots of other marketing buzz-words, all of which may be true.  However, this prices here are far too expensive.  I understand that people will pay a premium for trendy organic food, but the ambiance here is reminiscent of a cafe or diner, while the prices are from a fine dining Italian restaurant.  $12 for a meatball-  appetizer?  $11 for a hummus plate appetizer?  $18 for pasta dishes?  $29 for 16"" pizzas?  So you logically assume that for those prices, it must be REALLY high quality - think again.  I had the gnocchi with spicy sausage, and it was delicious.  But it was $16.50, and that is steep for gnocchi in red sauce, so I asked the server if the gnocchi was made in-house.  He replied ""no"".  So I just paid $16.50 for someone to buy 3rd party gnocchi and add red sauce.  My wife had the spicy Thai peanut quinoa bowl.  Also delicious.  Just one problem - no quinoa.  It was essentially stir fried broccoli slaw with peanut sauce and some quinoa sprinkled over the top.  Again, we asked the server (who was a very good server, by the way) if there was supposed to be more quinoa in the dish.  He stated ""yes, but my pasta chef is out today"".  So we just paid $10.95 for a quinoa bowl with no quinoa (this is by far the cheapest thing on the menu, including most appetizers and salads).  To be fair, we used a Groupon, so the final bill was not as much as it could have been.  But I am writing this from the perspective of someone paying full price.  So in summary, the food tasted really good, and that's gets one star.  The server was solid, and that gets a second star.  But I cannot give any stars for ambiance or overall value.  If the prices were cut by 30%, I could probably get behind this restaurant in some way.  But right now I feel like the old Picazzo's, which I've eaten at many times, simply poorly reinvented itself as a trendy gimmick restaurant to capitalize on the wave of healthy fads.  I commend Picazzo's for identifying the unmet need in our community for healthier food, and many of the reviews on Yelp seem to indicate that this is appreciated.

The chips and salsa were brought to the table initially upon sitting along with getting our drink order. We loved the smokey deep taste of the salsa but the chips not so much, although we ate them. They were a combination of flour and corn and had seasoning on them. I asked about getting some without seasoning and was told that was how they were served. Would have liked them better without seasoning. Ordered the table side guacamole and it was so delicious! Chunky and flavorful!

I ordered the tortilla soup, which was so good.  Rich broth, big chunks of chicken along with tortilla strips.  Partner had the carnitas, which we will definitely be back for!  Tortillas wrapped in corn husks, along with rice and beans.  Neither of cared for the black beans...found them too salty.  The rice was ok as well, full of taste and flavor (cumin I believe).  But the pork...so juicy and flavorful. Also comes with onions and peppers...the whole dish was so good.

Took advantage of the check in deal for dessert and we ordered the Tres Leches cake.  So good, rich, and yummy and was served with a strawberry sauce that just added to the entire experience.

-during the week, there isn't the same rush as on a weekend
-variety of price points
-national chain, so no matter where everyone is located they can try on at their local boutique

Major con - The associate that was assigned was not the best listener being that she put one of the two dresses I had limited it down to away as I asked her for the 3rd time to please leave it. It was obvious she was trying and was very nice though, it just seemed a little overwhelming for her and busy that Saturday.

Recommendations: 
-Shop the website first and save your favorites so that they can check their inventory before you arrive. 
-Go during the week. You actually get the time and focus needed to make a non-refundable purchase.
-either wear your own undergarments or plan to use theirs.
-make an appointment before you even step foot in the shop! 
-have all of your favorites pulled before you start trying so that you don't miss any of them and regret it later.

Food is wrapped in foil and shoved into a plain paper bag. The thin napkins look like a Costco special. And the only brand labeling appears to be on the cups.

But what about the food? Meh.

I met a friend for lunch, and it was the first visit for both of us. We each had a ""little cheeseburger,"" and she got an order of fries. First off, the ""little"" part is a misnomer; that was one big burger! I got mine wrapped in lettuce (the low-carb option) with onions, pickles, tomatoes, and jalapenos. It was a pretty good burger, but I'm not sure it was worth $5. I didn't try any of my friend's fries (they didn't look appealing to me; kinda limp), but I did snack on some of the in-shell peanuts they offered. A nice touch, I might add.

This location has a Coke machine that gives you hundreds of options, depending on what buttons you hit. A nifty gimmick that might warrant the $2.39 drink price, but I just wanted an iced tea. At least they offer free refills, so I guess I got my money's worth there.

Service was a bit slow, but everything was made to order, so I had no problem with that. And unlike some fast-food joints, this place was quiet enough that we could actually carry on a conversation while we waited for our food.

My husband had scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage and toast.   The eggs were in a small dish which he really liked, and it looked like way more than 2 eggs.  The sausage patties were perfect and he is a huge sourdough toast fan, so he was a happy trooper.   He wasn't crazy about the hash browns which were silver dollar sized potatoes.

2.  They can reach out privately to the customer, and sincerely apologize, (also stating that they will be having a meeting to correct the behavior...)

My order the lunch combo of two meats, my choices the baby back & St Louis ribs with the 2  side choices - mac and cheese and Cole slaw.

My waiter was friendly and on the spot. The food arrived within minutes of ordering. I preferred the St Louis style ribs due to the seasoned rub and lightly smoked flavor. The baby backs were tender and meaty but were just average. The slaw was a vinegar based flavor which was tangy and unique. The mac and cheese reminded me Kraft Mac and cheese flavor that I ate when younger - nothing to write home about.

I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the amount of lanes at Red Rock Lanes.  The computer system used for scorekeeping was relatively to date and easy to use.  Only complaint would be how uncomfortable the seats are.  They are tiny swivel type chairs that spring back to its original position when you stand up.  You will need quick reflexes when this happens because the backing can spank you right in your rear or arms with quite a bit of force.

We decided to pay for 2 games but were pooped out after 1.  We asked if we can receive a refund for the second game and the staff was VERY HELPFUL and did so without any issues.  I didn't expect a refund so this was a complete surprise.  Thanks Red Rock Lanes staff and management!

  For the main course we had the Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef and Wuhu Beef Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was the least favorite thing we ordered.  The noodles were stuck together and it had a sour taste.  The Beef Fried Rice was very good.  Lots of great tasting beef paired with the tasty fried rice.  The Mongolian Beef was well prepared with tensor beef and veggies.

Some people have mentioned the pastries are oily. The apple turnovers are very buttery, much more so than the stuff we usually get served in Toronto. Many Canadian pâtisseries do not use 100% butter and finding European style butter is also rare. So, those may be richer than you're used to. The croissants however did not come across as 'too buttery' to me. Of the croissant type items fir sale, the apple is the richest.

But then I stumbled upon this adorable little spot, boasting ""Best sandwiches!!"" on the sign outside. Or something like that. Something that made me go, ""best?! WELL OKAY!"" 

I got really excited upon entrance. If you have carb claustrophobia, never come here. I was surrounded by bread, cookies, scones, croissants, loaves, sammiches, muffins and danishes. I inquired about the sandwiches, and as the lady handed me one of the vegetable variety she proclaimed that it would be ""the best sandwich I've ever eaten."" WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, lady. You're speaking to a sammich-loving Yelper and this is a grand, sweeping statement. 

Then I got all excited cause I saw a slab of sticky ginger loaf, and I was all, ""um, gimme."" So I left with a bag o' carbs in hand. (NOTE TO ALL: Cash only).

Well, the loaf was kind of a dry let down, but the sandwich was quite satisfying. NOT the best I've ever eaten, but good. Lady, you lied. 

Overall, I'd give 'em another chance, but that dry slab o' loaf was way too overpriced. They'll have to wait their penalty time before I return.

You see, this particular spot previously housed a little place known as Gallo Blanco. The flavor of their tacos, particularly their carne asada, is forever burned in my memory. As a result, I have to remind myself to not compare these people to a place that no longer exists, at least not for the time being. It's simply just not fair.

With that out of the way, Café Tranquilo is a neat little hotel-based establishment that focuses on Latin-American cuisine. We stopped by one late afternoon to try some of their offerings. The place was empty for some odd reason - which was in stark contrast to the last time I was in this same dining room three years prior.

Their chips and salsa were excellent quality, with three variations being provided. Additionally, we ordered some tacos, including pollo, asada, pork, and fish. All were fine for what they were, although still not eh . . . never mind. Beans and rice were also all right.

Honestly, I don't know. Taco standards have significantly gone up in recent years to the point where I feel like I might have to return here and dive a little deeper into their menu to find out what they're all about.

The drinks we had were fantastic. Their mixologist, bar tender, mage of crafts, wizard of libations, I would pay 3 times the wage that Joes is paying Him just to come to my home kitchen and serve me drinks. 

But I just feel like Joes is still a young (opened in April 2016) and there were little oversights that a more tenured restaurant would have most likely have observed. 

I ordered the Sweetbreads... and based on the three pieces that managed to make it on my plate, were really delicious. I just really feel like I got gypped out of sweetbreads. 

And I love Bones, I love bone marrow (i'm  just gunna call it what it is, right now, Skelton butter) I'm more than willing to pay for a good plate of Bone Marrow. Unfortunately, what I got was a plate of Bone without the Marrow. Seriously, it looked great, but, the minuscule spoon full that I got only left a full plate of bread. 

Surprisingly enough, the liver pate was great. Somebody definitely put a lot of love into it. It's surprising, because I don't like pate. It was very well-balanced with good seasoning. I think Joes is some of the best I've tried. 

Now the wings. Let me preface this by saying, I survived Daddy Dukes Wing King Competition, so when I tell you they're  good you know that I know what I'm talking about. 

Fuck me rotten, the wings were awesome. Holy hell. I would cover my wife in that sauce if I could get enough of it into the tub.

The Boczniaki z kapusta in particular was well-liked - I couldn't believe I wasn't eating meat. It has a very rich, savory flavor.

We also enjoyed several of the cocktails, which are decently strong and reasonably priced.

Overall the whole meal was a success!",2018-04-20 01:30:21

When I lived in the area I would make excuses to go over there as much as possible. Let's see why it has all the right ingredients for an awesome sandwich shop.

Great bread, delicious meats, fresh vegetables. All the essentials are present and this place puts them altogether in the right order. I have had over a dozen types of sandwiches and they are all outstanding. In fact, I would just have to describe the sandwiches I only ate once or twice as less outstanding, but not less than outstanding. That barely made sense but I think you get what I am saying. My last trip they either made up a new sandwich or I just missed it over the last decade. Buffalo chicken sandwich. Yes, you just drooled a little. It tasted as I had suspected, amazing, but I will have to warn you that it had a little more heat than I anticipated. I am okay with it but somebody else might not like it a little more on the spicy side. So I recommend it for certain. What is strange is that I usually order the BLT. It is so basic and I can make those at home but for some reason Captain Bill's just makes a damn good BLT.

Time for a little truth out of me. Part of the appeal of Captain Bill's was the sandwich girls. It seems as though the Captain didn't hire unattractive help. The attractive help hasn't changed but what has changed is my age so now that I am married it is just a little creepy of me to notice these things. Or I am just a guy. Either way the younger crowd will enjoy the staffing scenery. Don't tell my wife I just said that...

Great sandwiches and the admittedly lovely and capable staff come together in a great sandwich shop with great prices. They have stood the test of time and if you are within a 5 mile radius of this place and you still go to a Subway, you should question why you are even on a site like Yelp and actually care about your food. Captain Bill's is also a very entertaining place to eat. Once you get there, you will understand what I mean.",2012-09-16 02:56:44

I first sat at the bar and perused the drink menu - I'm aware I'm going to pay upper scale prices for upper scale food, service, and ambience, but I don't like having to pay 8$ for a bottle of 2$ beer. They do have an impressive list of bottles to choose from, including some that are harder to find IPAs.

The table and menu looked good but it didn't really matter because of our terrible, terrible server.

I'll throw out some of his comments:

Him: ""I see you're on your phone so you must be not very interested in what I'm saying right now""
Us: ""wtf?""

Him: ""I think we got off on the wrong foot"" 
Us: ""huh?""
Him: ""I feel like there is nothing I can do to please you""
Us: ""wtf?""

And then trying to rush us out with half a bottle of wine left: ""Should I bring out some coffees and the bill?""

He seemed to get really offended when we made a joke about the beets that one a round on Top Chef when they came hidden under a pile of arugula - as if we had slapped his mom in the face. Super uncomfortable. 

It was so weird- he was awkward and impolite to us the whole night.
He then told us he ""was very ancy to leave so someone else would be taking over for him"", which we were elated to hear. We told our new server about the other dude's extreme strangeness/rudeness and he said he had an off personality and apologized. I would have liked to have seen maybe a comped dessert/coffee/app or really anything...because when you're looking at a 150$ bill and all you can talk about is how awful your service was for 90% of the night...it's not a great feeling.

My DC told me that had never happened to her on other visits to the restaurant, but I wouldn't recommend going back based on this experience.

PS:
The steak and chicken were both quite good!",2012-02-10 21:57:39

We struck up a conversation with the guys who let us sit and they got me even more excited explaining that Snoop does not disappoint but that he would most definitely show up pretty late.

Pros:
*Our first server was very good.  He helped us choose a great wine, and he took good care of us.
*The escargot was very nice - it's super lightly breaded and fried, which is unusual, but it tasted great and the tangy sauces + wild mushrooms went great with it.
*The house made sourdough was very nice, if a little dense, and the infused olive oil was very tasty.
*My friend ordered the steak frites and the fries were AWESOME. Super crispy.
*The prix fixe is a great deal.
*The decor is very lovely.
*I loved how their wine list is placed in an art book! And the selection, while small, is great.
*The dishes are presented beautifully.

Cons:
*The food wasn't that great, which is what I came for.
*The duck confit was dry, and I came here because I was craving the awesomely juicy one I had at Cafe St. Malo in Quebec City!  I also didn't like the wild rice and sauce it came with.
*My friend's steak was overcooked and tough.
*Our second server wasn't very good - she was very conspicuous in checking on us, which made me feel rushed.  She also tried to take away plates as we were still eating, and she brought out the wrong dessert for one of us.  She was polite, but just not very good at her job - but maybe she was new.
*The flourless chocolate cake wasn't as cocoa-y as I imagined it'd be and it was kind of dry.
*We ordered a vanilla creme brulee but we were brough a salted chocolate.  We didn't want to bother with waiting for the order to be corrected so we just went with it.  I did not like this at all!  There was a lot of salt in it and didn't taste like a dessert.  Not tasty.

I walked into the part of the building where you can buy clothes/accessories. There are tables and some kind of smoothie spot to your left and a boxing ring in the back. See what I mean by confusing? Aside from not knowing where to go, it is in a very conspicuous spot so it could be easy to pass and somewhat of a challenge for parking.

We poked our heads around the corner and it looked to be just a hang out and someone was celebrating a birthday. Finally I asked the girl behind the cash register where we could order food.  She explained a bit about the place and showed us around. I appreciated that and further confirmed my confusion statement assuming others had felt the same way before. ;) 

The patio is GREAT! Mismatched retro chairs, wooden picnic tables, hanging records and who could forget the silver trailer they serve food from?!  It took a minute to find the menu because she pointed around to random things and said, ""menu is written all over the place"" and that was it. Well, she was right...it's written on old tattered doors and wooden fence. Finally we went and asked for a real one..much better.

We got the meatball sliders and strawberry pecan salad. Both were DELICIOUS! Drinks were served in a glass coke bottle and what other than a mason jar. Cute. 

Now being somewhat familiar with the way things work I look forward to returning. Combination of good food, good weather and great atmosphere I can't wait to take someone who's never been. This is definitely an experience.(:",2013-10-10 16:42:09

From start to finish this place had that quaint French bistro feel. Best part was saying, I'm sure our server as French. He was France.  

Their knowledge of the food and wine was on point even when we had a friend from a region in France the server was so good in talking to him about its nuisances versus the other choices available. We were all floored.

Classic French dishes. We had a variety of dishes - fish, chicken, steak, soup. We loved everything.

They even offer a great price fixe menu. Take advantage of it! I had the steak frites. Damn!!!!! Best one. 

For dessert, of course creme brûlée. Tried the classic as well as the kahlua. Perfect! We also tried the chocolate mousse and the carrot cake dessert. Again, both delicious. However all of us were floored by the carrot cake. Fluffy, light but so flavourful.

Cocktails were on the strong side but.... still tasty.

Finally adding this review to my yelp

I went there last night (this isnt really last night it is few months ago - it is still excellent not too) and it was excellent - The beer list they have is fantastic and Mario who is a part owner was behind the bar and it was good talking to him

Arrived just at the end of happy hour, they have $1 off draft beers for happy hour and half priced glasses of wine and there was a certain amount off well drinks but i don't recall what that is

They are going to be working on their mixed drink menu, they wont have that ready to go for another week or two

Started out with Schneider Aventinus, Doppel Weizen Bock,Germany 8.2% which could be my new favorite beer, it is a unfiltered wheat bock, amazing

One of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen, and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beer

As i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page, and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to me

Foie Gras torchon with toast points, honey comb, apples, cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as well

The honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall 

My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that, it was a great salad, and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well, very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras :)

for my main i ordered the crispy half duck, it was confit duck style, the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with, i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ, and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast 

My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi, Black Tagliolini, Mediterranean Sea Bass

I tried the Sea Bass, which was was very good, with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing, although i didnt get to try them, i will certainly be trying them on my next visit

rubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were delicious

Seems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market, everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list 

will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking",2012-01-19 22:26:35

Can probably seat max 15 people at one time with some outdoor seating (like 3 tables). As we walked in the server/cashier was very helpful when asking questions on what to get. We opted in for the special number 1 which was a medium 3 topping pizza, one pound of wings, garlic bread, ceaser salad and 2 pops for 38.99. I thought that price was very fair for what you get.

We decided to eat in and enjoy the neighbourhood a little. In the summer time it does get very hot because you have the wood burning oven on and no ac.. the wait time for the meal was expected.. but they start serving you course after course. We started with the ceaser salad. It was huge. Came with bacon and fresh toasted bread (sub as croutons) then the garlic bread came and that was cheesy and delicious. Next our oven baked wings... 1 pound may not seem like much at a regular wing place for some people but this place gives you a good smokey charcoal flavour with lots of wings! We ordered the honey garlic as the server had suggested and my fiance (who only has spicy wings) thought it was amazing! Our pizza came last and it came with fresh basil on top. We ordered the Italiano which came with pepperoni, Italian sausage, red peppers and cheese. The pizza was thin and tasty with the cheese being perfect!!! It's not the type of cheese you would get at like pizza pizza, instead it's cheese that when you pull the apart the string of the cheese can go for miles. It was amazing.

When you go to most places to watch a game, you're stuck with your usual bar type food.  Miller's has all the fried foods, burgers, and nachos if that's your thing.  However, Miller's also has other options from fajitas, soups, salads, and steak.  Even though they were known for their super-sized nachos, we didn't partake in any of it during our most recent visit.  I've had it before and they are pretty damn good.  They're perfect to share with a group if you're not counting your calories. I ended up with a bowl of chili and a steak/chicken fajita combo.  Both meals were decent, nothing spectacular.  But I'm still giving Miller's Alehouse 4 stars because I see myself coming back one day to watch the game.

On my recent visit to sky harbor I found myself with some time to spare before my early flight so headed to grab a cup of joe. After discussing my options with the helpful barista I settled on a small hot mocha. It was a busy morning so did take some time to get my drink, but that's to be expected. The presentation was nice with some latte art and they have lids if you're wanting to grab your drink and go. The taste itself was well balanced, not overly sweet or chocolatey but you still get the flavor of espresso.

Overall my verdict is that I should trust my instincts, and regard my colleague's opinion with the same scrutiny as I regard their work - carefully and with a grain of salt. I arrived timely on a weekday evening and the place was bustling. The corner shop had all the windows and doors open for a covered patio feeling, the décor is somewhere between modern, vintage, ornate...think white-gray marble with gold accents and how that's coming back in style. My party of three sat on a white love seat with two round tables between us, and two average black plastic chairs on the other side. The setup was cozy, the music wasn't terribly loud, and the service arrived shortly.

The menu was short - seasonal I suppose? Most items were available as part of the Summerlicious menu, so it was the best deal for sure at $48. I went with the grilled octopus, Cornish hen, and chocolate cake. The open rosé had quite sweet notes which suited my palate, at $10. Plating and overall presentation of the food was great - so at least first impressions were promising.

The octopus came with a side of Caprese salad - the small portion of octopus tasted blanched then tossed on the grill, soft and fully cooked inside, but burnt on the outside. All I could taste was the charred outer - the ends were a bit crispy but the other pieces just tasted like blackened food.

The hen was well presented and not bad - crispy skin with sesame, flavourful inside, the asparagus and cauliflower purée added texture variance and made the dry parts better. The asparagus lattice had a similar texture as the octopus, which I didn't care for. The mixed grains went well with the chicken, though I'm not typically a fan.

Finally, time for dessert. Perhaps I didn't look closely enough into the menu but a sliver of mousse cake with a rice cracker base was presented. On the sweet side, but went nicely with my wine. There was a spoon of sorbet? Ice cream? It had an icy texture but appeared creamy, and melted rapidly. Either way, it went well with the cake, but everything melted quickly.

Overall, the service was timely and attentive and I had no major complaints - except our waiter never mentioned his name. Fortunately he was always only a step away so that compensated most of the time. The food didn't meet my expectations but matched to the average Yelp rating - I guess I should've known! The atmosphere would be great for a casual glass of wine and a chat, it didn't make for eating as much as I would've liked and the bartender was rowdier than I expected. At one point, odd smells came from somewhere, and the open concept brought in all the flies trying to sip my wine. Given the price point, I probably won't be back.",2017-07-22 15:14:30

It's right across from the Lakewood high football stadium. They'll probably make a killing in the fall or anytime the civic center lets out. Don't know if they are as well versed in Greek fare as Famous Gyro George( late night commercials, several locations in old fast food buildings in questionable neighborhoods around Cleve). I kid of course. If you do ever see a Famous Gyro George, you should probably prepare to be robbed. 

The menu is small. A handful of traditional Greek items serve as sides to the main dish of gyro. I had mine without the delicious looking meat from the spit. And with extra feta. Bad idea. The feta was too sharp and ruined the great cucumber sauce. But for only four bucks, it wasn't a huge travesty. I got an order of spanakopita for 2 bucks. It's small, but if you just want a taste of spinach, it works. Also had grape leaf rolls for 4 bucks. You get a half dozen tasty rice rolls with a hint of i think mint? They also make fries to go with the sandwich, but i was just going tradish Greek on this one.

A total tab of 14 dollars at 1 in the morning to feed two at not a Taco Bell is a good deal. I even tipped two dollars to cover the credit card fee they have to pay. I try to do this with local or new businesses that are gracious enough to take credit.
There are a couple stools just across from the open cooking area where you can sit and stare out at Madison ave. Said cooking area is covered with a tiki style grass roof,which combined with the heat and aroma from the spits, made me feel like i was actually in the Mediterranean!

We have been to most of his other restaurants after the tragic end of the Fate era, but have not been as satisfied.  Until last night.... when we finally had a chance to step into Sochu House.
Walking in, we were a little intimidated by the soft neon lights and huge sheets of hanging white cloth (we had just come from a movie and were in the very definition of casual attire).  It took a minute to be seated because the wait/host staff could not see us standing in front from behind some of that stated white cloth, but once seated we were quickly brought menus and cucumber water.  I asked about the reverse happy hour I saw on the website from 10:30pm-close, but apparently that was only offered in the bar.  Our waiter did offer to move us to some chaise lounges available in the bar area, but we decided a proper table was necessary to stuff our starving faces at the point.
We ordered: Wasabi Soy Chicken and Friend Tofu tapas and the House Dynamite with chicken entree (this was our favorite at Fate).  I held onto a menu because of the warnings of small portions from other reviews, and from our experience at Sens (his other tapas-style restaurant), I figured we might still be hungry after these 3 choices.  Surprisingly, these portions were pretty darn big and very filling! We walked out of there with a $50 bill (after drinks) and FULL, happy bellies!  We were especially please to find Johnny's home cooked goodness style we fell in love with at Fate had made a return at Sochu House.

If I'm not mistaken, the patties are served in 6 oz portions, which leads me to think that I'll be full only if I got a side of french fries.  I like my burgers gourmet, so I was excited with all the different toppings and flavors each burger had to offer.  

I had a chance to try the truffle ketchup- not a fan, the truffle flavor is overpowering the ketchup. The spicy ketchup- more up my alley, but definitely the original was the best.  The perfect medium was to mix the two together.  Either way, from first taste I could tell it was no ordinary ketchup, so I asked.  Sounds like it's a local place with two brothers or something to that effect- said so our waitress, that produces them and Burger Joint was smart enough to carry this awesome ketchup.

The burger is greasy, served with the perfect amount of ingredients, offers a satisfying feeling that you'll probably make a mess out of piled high burger.  A little on the pricey side, definitely satisfying taste, but can't be an everyday burger, more like a treat.  Had a free Yelp check in for some fries and I walked out with a great big smile.

But on this occasion we were enjoying some downtown attractions and decided to walk over for a slice.   Now these slices are HUGE!  I chose Pepperoni and was very pleased with the taste, a little greasy but fat is flavor right? 

I will say that I was disappointed to see that a cheese pizza that just came out of the oven was tossed into the garbage right in front of us.  I saw the cook lift it up a little and I guess to him it was more on the well done side so he tossed it.   I get that there is a certain quality they are going for and although I appreciate that as the consumer, wasting food is not a good impression.  It was salvageable and they could definitely think about donating their slightly imperfect pies to some of the local shelters, or some of the food service programs for the homeless (rescue mission) just saying.   

They have daily specials and honestly they all looked delicious, and the place always looks busy which is a great sign.   There were a few of us using our complimentary slice coupons that were graciously given to us by the facility some time ago and we just never thought we would take advantage of these until now, the only problem I found is that the worker taking them had a bit of an attitude and kept repeating ""Oh you have one too?"" in a bothered sort of way.

First - gotta come clean, we only tried the veggie dogs. Lord only knows, the beef dogs must be fabulous, because the veggie dogs are legit. As in, I could barely tell they were veggie dogs. They had all the texture and taste of a regular hotdog, minus the dripping grease. So, if you've ever been interested in trying high quality vegetarian protein, try this. I got the Po Boy (delicious) and the hubster had both a Classic and a veggie chili dog.

Food: We got the nutella bambalone which is like a donut with rich nutella squeezed inside. Of course, who doesn't love nutella? They also have the custard option, both for $3.The chocolate cookie was a little dry for my preference and was less than a dollar for a super small cookie.

I came here with some local customers of mine who chose it as a great lunch spot. It's not expensive, so it's a good sign that a place is great when someone picks it even though they aren't buying. It's the kind of place you want to just share with people.

You can get 3 tacos with rice and beans for a little over 7 bucks. If your feeling like a glutton, you can get additional tacos for $1.75. I couldn't narrow it down past 4, so I went with gluttony. Don't judge me.

Heres the final verdict: Carnitas and Al Pastor were both fantastic. Not greasy, full of flavor and cooked beautifully. If I lived here, it might be hard to keep me from camping in front of this place. The carne asada was very good as well. The Pollo was good, but a little flat compared to the others.

This is probably the first time I've ever had dinner at 4:30. Partially because I wanted to be home in Markham at a reasonable time (I didn't have the car), but also I wanted to beat the lineup for this place. It worked, we were the first ones in!

We ordered the sauteed mixed seafood with vegetables, grandfather chicken, deep fried black cod, and beef tenderloin with chinese steak sauce on hot plate. It came with a complimentary soup, which...was rather tasteless. Good for those health conscious, but it definitely did feel bland.

The mixed seafood with vegetables tasted very good! The squid they use certainly is more unique and not those types where you can choke yourself with. The scallops and shrimp were also good, and the vegetables were just the right texture, not too hard or soft. The beef tenderloin was also good, and I really liked the sauce that came with it. On the other hand, the grandfather chicken was a little disappointing as it felt everything was all mushed together. The fried black cod was okay, but there was a lot of oil in it (it does make sense though, it's fried).

Service was disappointing and extremely slow and the food was rather good but expensive and you would expect better quality for the price you pay. We all had the bottomless mimosas for $15 and I had the Mob Boss pizza for $32. 

The main problem was that the food took over 45 minutes to get to our table and my pizza was cold by the time my friends got their food. The free appetizer we received unfortunately did not warm up my pizza even though it was a nice gesture.

I was in the area so I decided to give this place a try since the rating was not that bad. First, my impression of the place when I first walked in was that it looked like a grungy bar in the west end (no offense). I was expecting bikers to walk in at any point in time, so no points for decor. They sat us down right away in a dark corner. We looked at the menu for a few minutes and wanted to order and we had a few questions. We were just here to eat and leave and weren't here to socialize with our friends, but no one came to our table and didn't seem to acknowledge our existence. We finally got someone's attention where we had to literally scream at someone to get some service, cause they all seem to be running away from us, perhaps they were busy and understaffed? No excuses! 

We ordered the meal for two people and I highly don't reccommend it because it's not really the deal that you think it is. Our waiter was not knowledgable and was constantly confused about their restaurant menu. He didn't know what the chef's appetizer was today. But we were fine and just wanted our food. The meal makes you order a chicken entree and a veggie entree. So we ordered butter chicken and saffron vegetables. The saffron sounded really good because it said it had cashews in the sauce. 

So when our appetizers came, we had already waited for more than 20 mins since we ordered. They were these four tiny triangles (samosas) and the skin didn't have the consistency that I was used to. Maybe they were more healthy but at that point I didn't care, I was HUNGRY!!!. We had to wait another 20 minutes for our entrees to come, seriously? Do I really think that they were making our food from scratch? Because it would have taken the same amount of time. So our two entrees came with rice and naan. The rice was fine nothing special just plain rice. The naan came cold! I thought this stuff was supposed to be fresh. The butter chicken was okay, tasted more like tomato sauce chicken, no butter. The saffron vegetables was a big disappointment, it was full of the what looked like frozen vegetables, beans, peas, corn and the little bits of carrots. There might have been one piece of paneer in there. The saffron sauce didn't taste like it had much cashews in it, it didn't have the nutty taste or the gritty consistency. It was terrible even the generic Compliments butter chicken sauce you get in a jar at Metro tastes better. I had a hard time scoffing it down with some cold naan. At this point, when I thought there was only two waiters working their butts off the ""owner"" came and asked us how our food was and proceeded to tell us how they use this healthy style of cooking to make their foods. If this style consists of removing the main ingredients of your dishes like butter and cashews then you have succeeded! He was being all fake and all and I hated it, I'm like no BS pls. Where were you when we were waiting for our waiter and our food? You could have made yourself useful and made some samosas or something, (or maybe he was, if so I apologize but still one star). 

Overall it was a bad experience for me, if what they meant by fusion is to take out good quality ingredients and replace with bland foods then I am not okay with that.",2015-08-10 19:51:11

We stopped in for lunch which I recommend since there are less crowds compared to dinner time and it's easier to find a parking spot-which is only one reason I've stayed away.

However, on this visit we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated right away. The loud music and TVs are expected and this way you don't have to listen anyone else's conversation but your own.

Our waiter was friendly and we ordered up a draft beer and and spicy egg rolls and wow what a presentation! Flavors were all there and this was the perfect starter dish.

We split the California burger which was loaded with avocado. We ordered it medium and it was a bit undercooked. The bread was sourdough but they used a sliced version which for me on a burger was a let down since I was expecting a bun.  Nonetheless the burger and side of stringy fries was delicious.

The BEST dishes, that i highly recommend are the young coconut ceviche (the coconut is smooth, and not too coconut forward, so the citrus balances well, and is bright and fresh with the apple, and celery and beautiful green sauce on top), the chorizo verde is the BEST TACO, not sure how they do it, but this taco I would order again even if there was meat on the menu, the jackfruit taco was a classic vegan preparation done as pulled pork, and it was also tasty! The veggie fritters were also super tasty, and not very veggie forward in terms of taste (picky eaters would probably eat these), and they came with a nice sauce. All the desserts were amazing: the churros were hot and fresh with a banana chocolate dipping sauce, the charred pineapple with coconut cream was delicious, and the triple chocolate mouse was good (though, not as good as a non-vegan version).

The Rosaburger was okay, but a little too sweet and one noted (I love a good veggie burder, but maybe the vegan aspect makes it a lot harder to get the complexity of flavours one often finds with veggie patties), the onion stack sandwich is literally just that, onion rings on a burger bun (and which the onion rings were well done, this didn't feel like a sandwich to me), the roasted Japanese eggplant actually plays second fiddle to the sikil pak (spicy and yummy) and other components on the plate. The jicama salad was our waiters recommendation, and it was okay, but felt like we were just eating jicama in some bland-ish green sauces with lots of pumpkin seeds. 

The no gos for me were the onion taco (the only flavour is slimy onion), the spicy roasted carrots (these were not spicy and tasted slightly overdone, and just were generally something you could so easily DIY), and the Tijuana-style broccolini (some kind of smokey flavour they use does not compliment the broccolini, and as someone who regularly eats the stuff, it's not a very exciting vegetable, especially when it is very tough). 

The drinks were good! the Pepinon is not too sweet, with a ver nice ginger beer and lime balance, where you can still taste the cucumber. The Punta Rosa is the BEST!!! Order this!!! It is reminiscent of a grapefruit marguarita, and super tasty! 

Service was friendly, but a little spacey (things would get forgotten, or missed, and we constantly had to ask for water), the vibe is upscale hipster (no surprise given the location), and the place is beautiful. 

I think it's nice Toronto has nicer offerings for vegans, and I would definitely recommend it to any vegans who asked. But with the price ticket and the many offerings in the city, I don't know if I'll be rushing back.",2018-06-01 15:15:06

Cp6tLUoGPEt0b6lWBlK88w,YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,ObOI8Vopk60YlPA32AQDBg,1,13,9,4,"This review has been a long time coming, but I am finally just DONE DONE DONE with them, so I wanted to warn others so they don't have to go through what I went through. If you don't want to read the LONG review, just know that you will most likely regret getting a car and certainly having a car serviced here. 

I purchased my Kia Soul here in 2010 brand new. Traded in a car at the same time. Dealers were very shady, but really, that is pretty standard for Vegas. I looked over the paperwork questioning everything and they moaned and groaned and made this huge show out of making NO money off this sale, such utter and complete crap, considering in the end even though I traded in a car, AND put down 5k, that car cost me nearly 17k! Yea, I was an idiot but after 3 hours in the salesroom it was either take the car, or throw myself in front of one.

Even after I thought we had a price and payment worked out,  we went in and they wanted to add a package where I got all my maintenance stuff included for two years. Now I know these things are never good deals but I have bad luck with cars, so the thought of things being covered was too tempting. Fast forward 2 years and after I sat and did the math, I ended up paying over $120 dollars for every oil change if you compare cost of that package vs. paying for them myself, even if you add in that the first big service was covered in that time (normal cost $400). Now, had something gone wrong I would have hoped it would have been covered, but nothing ever did, so I really overpaid. 

After those two years were over, I them embarked on the lovely 'screw the lady every time she comes in"" plan. I brought my car into them because I have heard horror stories of factory warranties not covering things if you haven't had everything done through the dealer, so I faithfully brought my car in every 3000k miles. 

Did you know that every hose, filter, screw, fluid, etc. etc. needs to be replaced every 3000k miles?? Yeah, sarcasm there, but seriously, that is what they want you to believe AND of course pay for. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. there was something other than the oil change that HAD to be done (always managing to be around $100) or else ""IT MAY VOID THE FACTORY WARRANTY"" Seriously, they try and scare you into paying for BS things like that. Some things I fell for, others I knew were total crap, but overall I know I was screwed repeatedly and it got to the point where I would get physically sick to my stomach when I knew an oil change was coming up. One of the guys actually tried to tell me that I needed new tires TWO WEEKS after I had put new tires on the car from Discount (the only thing I did not have done at the dealership)

Now lets fast forward to this year. I pay for the 60k service ($1,100!) which they assures me covers every single solitary thing in that car, every thing that needs to be checked, tuned up, replaced, taken care of in any way, is supposed to be done. I have that done in February, in May-ish the car starts (very rarely) stalling or idling rough. Not enough to freak me out, but enough to make me wonder what in the world it could be when I supposedly (3 months earlier) had everything under the sun done on this car. 

I decide it can wait until the next oil change and bring it up when I bring it in. Cue the 

""Oh is could be this fluid which we can replace for $$$$"" 

Me- Wasn't that replaced during the 60k service? 

""Oh yea, well then it could be this part that we can replace for $$$ 

Me- Wasn't that checked in the 60k mile service?

""Oh yes, well it could be this thing which we can replace for $$$ 

Me- Wasn't that do....

'Look, it could be a ton of things, and I wasn't there watching them while they did the service so who knows what was done (ARE YOU COMPLETELY F'in kidding me??) but it sounds like a VERY SERIOUS issue and you definitely need to leave it for a few days to let us drive it around and see what is going on. It will be a few hundred dollars but that will be put towards whatever we need to do to fix it. 

At this point I ask if my warranty covers any of this

""All the warranty really covers is if the engine decides to blow up ""

Yes, that was what he told me. This fabulous bumper to bumper, 100k mile warranty through Kia, apparently will only cover the engine blowing up. While I know that is also utter BS, this was the absolute last straw with this place.
I would rather shove hot tire rods up my bum than ever ever ever step foot into or give one more penny, to Findlay Kia again.",2014-08-30 22:08:20

We were seated towards the front of the restaurant which had the sun blaring in and it was really  warm and just genuinely not a positive experience sitting there with the sun blaring in our faces so we did ask to be moved and moved to the very back of the restaurant where the ping pong tables were Jenga and some video games. The happy hour crew that had been sitting outside under the misters decided to make their way into the area where we were and began playing games and being so obnoxiously loud it ruined our dinner with the girls and the birthday celebration. We had such high hopes for this place and we were really looking forward to enjoying the s'mores for dessert but because of the rude drunk adults that could not show respect or consideration for the other patrons enjoying the back game room area, we chased down our waiter and could not get out of there fast enough. I literally walked out the door with the second half of my burger in my hand and ate it on the drive home that's how unpleasant our experience was. Overall the place was cute but for a salad,  burger, pizza place I found the menu items to be rather overpriced and our burgers were nothing to write home about certainly not for $15 and the salads were basic at best. I prefer The Culinary Dropout hands down over this place. Due to the fact our waiter came over and apologized to us no less than three times about the noise level and how rude the other patrons were being, I felt as though the manager should have at least come over and offered to move us to another table away from the obnoxious drunk people and comp our dessert but that didn't take place so I will never return here again and will definitely sway people away from coming to this establishment.",2018-05-26 03:29:02

I recently came here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was bustling. We were seated promptly and our order was taken in a timely fashion. The star of the food was definitely the Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) these were clearly made fresh; the filling was so juicy, the soup delectable and the dough nicely cooked. This may have been the best dumpling filling I have ever had which is saying a lot cause I do have a bit of a dumpling addiction. Another dish I really enjoyed was the shanghai noodles which were cooked perfectly and contained a healthy portion of meat, shrimp and veggies, this dish is a winner. 

On the other hand there were some dishes that were just OK. A cold dish consisting of beef tendon and garlic was pretty good, it was a bit gelatinous but the raw garlic gave it a good punch of flavour. The fried dumplings I was not a big fan of, they were too doughy, not crispy enough and greasy. Lastly we ordered a fried fish dish that was covered in a sweet and garlicky sauce, the fish was cooked nicely but there was too much sauce for my liking; it certainly masked the natural flavour of the fish. We did order some dessert as well which was a steamed dumpling with what I believe was egg yolk inside, for a Chinese dessert this was a hit, I enjoyed it. 

The service here was pretty friendly and our food was brought out hot and fresh. The restaurant itself is pretty bright and clean, kind of small and seems to get busy at peak hours. Overall if you are looking for some good Shanghainese in Markham this is certainly a good option.

It seems that they have their new menus in place now, which is a great replacement from what they had before. Lots of nice pictures which reinforce their relatively large selection in comparison to other Vietnamese places in the city.

I specifically ordered a grilled pork banh mi to go, which was not originally offered a while back. For $6, you get a fair-sized sandwich, probably smaller than what you'd find at Subway or Jimmy John's, but with a very different taste. All the standard ingredients of carrot, daikon, cucumber, cilantro, and jalepeno were included, along with the sauce that makes the sandwich taste distinctly Vietnamese. Adding to this medley of flavors was the perfectly grilled pork, which has been consistent across other dishes like the com tam and bun as well. There aren't that many banh mi places in Pittsburgh, but this is definitely a winner in my book.

The only small concern I could bring up is that there was a bit more sauce than is usually found in banh mi, so it was a bit messy with the sauce dripping out at the other end. But it wasn't overwhelming at all, so it's not a huge issue.",2015-12-12 22:29:44

njv-nwr2ILXppBgsiCLY9w,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,CTiWs36A_sX3eahdqrYxUQ,4,20,13,15,"Prior to becoming the Benedum, this marvelous odeum was known as The Stanley Theater from 1912 to 1987. A legendary venue, The Stanley hosted performances from scores of famous acts including Bob Marley whose very last concert took place here in September of 1980. Billboard magazine even declared it the ""Number One Auditorium in the U.S."" for several years during the late 70's and early 80's. 

Being an ardent, studied (obsessed?) fan of hard rock and heavy metal, I am aware of the Benedum's history but never came here during that heyday (I was but a child then). What may have been the grandest of stages for the likes of Thin Lizzy, Blue Oyster Cult, Iron Maiden (their first ever Pittsburgh gig was here on the 4th of July in '81!), and Judas Priest (whom Maiden opened for) is now better suited for low-key entertainment from my perspective.

The Benedum is a beautiful and elaborate hall with fine acoustics and dedicated, professional staff, but I feel that it was the wrong place for Alice In Chains, whom I caught here very recently.  

Thinking that this would have to be an ""unplugged"" set or a VH-1 Storytellers type of affair considering where it was to be held, I almost didn't bother to procure a ticket (I had to go to stubhub.com since it was a sell-out). Alas, the lure of seeing a band I admire for the first time in person was strong. 

My faults are as follows...

1-AIC sounded fine, but the venue killed the vibe for me. Again, I know that many hard rock/metal bands passed through it decades ago, but I have no idea what it was like then. Today, it doesn't work for these kinds of shows; it was too confining. The seats were small, people were wedged against me, and there was no freedom of movement.  It was almost as if the venue tamed the show, and because of that, I feel that it should have been held at Stage AE.

2-Being that the concert was at the Benedum, it attracted a lame, sandals-khakis-polo shirt WXDX/WDVE listening crowd who don't know how to act at these kinds of gigs. Asinine behavior, inconsiderate bullshit, and much more occurred...

a)Some kid three rows down couldn't handle his liquor, regurgitating whatever he ate throughout the concert.

b)A middle-aged couple kept trying to dance awkwardly on the chairs and steps, almost breaking their necks several times.

c)A gang of dorky, fat, twenty-something manboys who watch way too much pro wrestling (and likely porn) chanted wrestling slogans and made lewd comments about every woman they saw as if they themselves were Adonises.

d)A jackass in front of me wore a very tall trucker cap for some idiotic reason, obscuring my view, and I couldn't stand lest someone complain.

e) The two men on either side of me made me feel like a sardine. 

f) People kept walking in late! The poor ushers were scrambling around with flashlights in hand trying to help these hapless, chronically tardy fools find their seats! 

3-AIC only played for about 75 minutes!

Save the Cultural District for musicals, comedy, opera, and the symphony for there are plenty of other more suitable venues for the loud and heavy. The sheer exquisiteness of the Benedum alone warrants a 4 star rating, so I shall be forgiving and only deduct 1 star for the promoter's lack of forethought. It could have simply been my seat location (I was wayyyyy up top), and as I tried to slowly make my way out of the Benedum, my opinion of the experience apparently put me in the minority (I heard no complaints). Nonetheless, I didn't have a gas of  time and almost departed early due to my discomfort. 

P.S. The chandelier on the ceiling is awe-inspiring, resembling a cathedral of light and a starship simultaneously. The Benedum truly is a comely, regal old gal inside and out.",2013-05-20 03:09:51

The garage door was open on this lovely spring day, and the big open hole in the shopping mall makes you go ""Oooh, what is THIS?"" and want to go inside, so in I went.

The mocha I got was amazing. The espresso has that nutty flavor and the chocolate was richer than most places. It was so good that I returned the next day... and the next day... at this point, I'm driving from Scottsdale out to Arcadia, bypassing at least 5 other coffee joints, just to go to Black Cat. It's that good.

On the subsequent visits, I got their toddy; WOW. I generally can't drink coffee with no sweetener, but this toddy was awesome. It wasn't bitter and was delicious with just a bit of milk. And the caffeine! I'm almost immune to caffeine at this point in my college career, but half of a large toddy kept me wide awake and productive from about 8pm untill after midnight. Schwing!

The atmosphere is really really cool; no hipster vibe at all, lots of young professionals working. They have dog water bowls outside, and yesterday there was a guy with his German Shepherd pup sound asleep on the floor next to him; it was adorable and so cool that they were allowed to sit just inside the garage door and nobody was spazzing out. There's art and music without being overpoweringly hipster snob. The staff are really sweet and laidback; the one guy says ""No worries!"" to everything. 

They have a punch card deal too, and it's buy 9, get one free, not buy 10 like everywhere else. Winning!

The triple berry parfait I had yesterday afternoon is the only thing I'm knocking down stars on; it didn't feel as ice cold as a dairy product should, and that made me wonder if it had been kept at the ""safety zone"" temperature. The yogurt was kind of watery, not the thick consistency you'd expect, and some of the berries were mush essentially. It was delicious until about halfway through when it turned very acidic-tasting... and I got heartburn (which I NEVER get) after eating it.  I think I will stick to the very scrumptious-looking cakes and muffins from now on, because this parfait was iffy.",2013-04-26 17:04:20

I ordered the sampler platter, and a bunch of extra sides. (I admit I'm a sides whore). My favorite thing was the brisket, which kind of surprised me, because I usually hate brisket, too fatty.

Downside: there was practically no sauce on anything and they only gave a little cup of it, took awhile to get an extra serving. And it tasted very strongly of ketchup. Not impressed.  My ribs were VERY fatty, if you like that kind of thing great , me not so much. And the service was very slow. Oh, and the chili tasted like salty wet cat food, and yes, I've tried cat food before.

Overall, a good experience for greek food. There are plenty of options for all palates, including a kids menu.",2016-05-10 23:18:13

It was a 3 course meal which we shared. We had the Singapore Slaw and Coconut Shrimp + Green Curry Soup for our appetizers. I liked the slaw but did not care for the soup. It tasted more like something to put on top of rice than soup. The temperature was just warm, not hot. It might be a preference but I like my soup piping hot.

Exceptionally pleased with this location time after time. I've just stopped ordering ribs from here as well as any number of other steak places in town. I guess my tastes run different.

Arrived after 9 p.m. on a weeknight. Greeted and seated right away. Server was nearby and apologized for taking so long to get to us. Huh? She was there in a couple minutes.

It's hot so I let her know I'd be drinking a lot of water. Smart server: she brought extra glasses. Made us both happy.

Huge qty of pulled pork served hot! Great side of chili. I like it so much I asked for 2 of them as my 2 sides. Didn't even flinch. Just served what I'd ordered.

We drive past the location off of Happy Valley as well as the one on the west side around Bell off 101 to come to this one even though it adds 15-30 minutes more driving.

First, it is difficult to find if you don't know what to look for (it's underneath Far Niente - so you get the feeling right off the bat that it's Far Niente's poorer cousin).   Next, the food disappointed us slightly. Finally, the wine pricing definitely caters to the Bay St crowd, so even the glasses start at $10.50 (the cheaper selection of reds listed online weren't on the drink menu that we were given...).  

When we were seated, the hostess initially sandwiched us between two other tables, even though the place was about 20% full.  Seriously?  Does anybody ever request to be crowded in with other people?  So we asked to be relocated, which was fine.  We had planned to order a selection of appetizers (we weren't very hungry) but as it turned out there was a nifty deal (any 5 apps for $40), so we went with that.  

The sizes were all decent (perhaps the mezze plate was a bit too generous with the pita, relative to the portions of condiments provided), but the flavours were hit and miss.  I was a fan of the twice baked chicken wings, though my partner thought they were a bit salty.  The corn and crab cake was okay, but I don't understand the raves here. The mini yakitori burgers were yummy, but the bread was slightly stale.   The soft shell baja fish tacos were bland, with the corn tortillas being too thick. 

Given the high prices (which I get, it's the financial district), you'd expect them to kick it up a notch.  While the presentation of the dishes was fine, the quality was a let down.  Perhaps the entrees are better than the apps.",2012-05-05 17:13:15

We seated ourselves and the server came over shortly for our drink orders. We started off with miso soup (which we later found that it was complimentary when dining in). The soup was a bit salty and it had thicker seaweed, but I found it enjoyable. 

We ordered salmon and white tuna sashimi and for sushi we ordered their spider roll and dynamite roll. The food arrived fairly quickly and nicely presented with sriracha sauce accents on the plate. The salmon sashimi had a bit of fishy taste; maybe due to the thawing of the fish. However the white tuna was quite good. The spider roll was pretty basic, it was just rice, mayo, leafy lettuce. This is a bit different from what other sushi places offer; usually would find sliced cucumber and avocado. However the crab was crispy and served warm. The dynamic roll had spicy tuna, salmon and avocado. The spicy tuna had great flavor and the spiciness did not over power the taste of the tuna. 

The interior of the restaurant is quite cold and sterile looking. The tables and walls are all white. However, there are colorful chairs to offset the bland look. The look is modern but it doesn't have any Japanese inspirations. I do like the large floor to ceiling windows that wrap around the store.

I like that there is a bit of flexibility in their dishes. I can have pasta, or curry or gyros. So there isn't a big fuss if a group of us want to eat there and all have different tastes. My usual for quite awhile was the broiled steak kabob. The meat is always very tasty (but not always the most tender) and the basmati rice fluffy and nicely spiced. The vegetables are always overcooked. Not that I'm a bit fan of them anyway but I might be more enticed to eat them if this was not the case.

My current favorite is the chicken curry. I get it about medium spicy but then I cover it in their racy red sauce. I could pour that on just about everything it's so good. The hummus is my  mom's favorite dish. I like it too but it is so filling that I usually can't finish my entree if we get it as an appetizer.

We went on a Saturday night. Even though the place clearly says you have to be there by 8:30 to be seated, the sign on the door was already turned to the closed side and it was 8:07!!?? What is the deal with this place? I felt like just turning and walking away but the wife insisted on going in. The place was completely dead. Maybe 3 tables of customers and a group of relatives at another table. The inside is like you are in someones house that was converted to a restaurant. Nothing fancy and the walls need a really good scrubbing but for the most part it was relatively clean. The house is located on the northwest side of the street. Just south of a St Vincent De Paul building. 

We were seated right away and ordered some spring rolls first. They were clear rolls and were stuffed with shrimp, beef, noodles, and some cilantro. There were two decent sized rolls and came with a peanut dipping sauce. They were tasty but I couldn't help but think they would be much better warm. 

I ordered the 27 Pho ap Chao - pan fried noodle stir fry w/ beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, and veggies. It was piping hot and had a pretty decent flavor to it. It had a massive amount of vegetables. I am talking carrots, leaks, snow peas, etc. It could have used a little more meat but other than that it was very good. Then at the bottom of the dish I finally dug my way to the pan fried noodles. They were outstanding. Crunchy but soft. Burnt a little but not too much. They may have been the best part of the dish. My wife ordered some spicy chicken with vegetables. Her meal came with white rice and was huge as well. It tasted very similar to my dish but without the bomb noodles. 

The server was very friendly and it seemed very much like a family ran business. The entire bill came out to under 30 bucks and could have fed two more people. I am very glad I gave this place a second and third chance. My only suggestion would be to either stop doing phone orders or provide the extra service and to not put your closed sign up when you are supposed to be open for almost another whole hour. If this place wasn't recommended from a friend I probably would have never gave it another chance. 

To their defense they have a sign that states they do not take phone orders when they are busy. Maybe they should at the least put that on their answering machine so people don't keep trying to call back?

When we sat down our waiter came around and my first impression was that he was overly cavalier. As the meal went on he kind of grew on me, especially because having recently injured my shoulder my right arm was in a sling and he had the food pre-chopped such that I could eat it one-handed with ease. Now on to the food. 

I  ordered the mixed greens which tasted fresh and the dressing was light rather than overpowering as most dressings seem to be these days. It allowed the flavor of the various greens to shine through. Afterword for the main course I got the wild mushroom tamales. They were moist and fluffy. The seasonings were just perfect, and the jicama on the side really hit the spot. These were the best tamales I have ever had, though to be honest I am not a tamale connoisseur.

This is the first time that I have been to the Preserve after reading, and hearing so much about it. I found it to be quite disappointing. 

The issues with the Preserve, again, only from a bird spotting, and photography standpoint are many.

1. The area is completely overgrown. It has limited the view of all of the ponds and removed the vast majority of quality shooting locations. Beyond that, walking along the paths is ridiculous. I was walking along ponds, I should have been able to see, completely obstructed by shrubs and trees.

To define a quality shooting location; an area one can sit in, with a 180 degree view of the pond or the subject in front of the person. 
There were trees that had 1/3 of its trunk covered in debris. I sat and watched birds, rats, and rabbits emerge from the debris. 

This overgrowth is both unsightly, and a fire hazard. 

2. The majority of the benches and blinds have been rendered unusable. Again, it comes down to the area being overgrown.  I walked past several benches that were placed on the edge of the pond, yet a view of dense shrubbery was presented. The blinds in the special use areas are shrouded and covered. What's the point of having a permit to use an area that has no unobstructed view? 

3. Varmints. There are rabbits EVERYWHERE. Yes, they're cute, but rabbits bring rats, and there were a ton of those too. This is a disease outbreak waiting for a place to happen. 
I went today looking for Burrowing Owls. All gone. Why? Cats. Feral cats have preyed on all of the Burrowing Owls, and they have been removed.

My girlfriend and some friends came here on Valentine's Day for the first time. The dining space reminds me of a cross between an izakaya/sake bar and a beer hall with raised wooden communal tables.

Two of us ordered set dinners while my girlfriend and I split a boku maki, aburi flight, and wagyu aburi nigiri. It's clear that Boku places stock in aesthetics, with all orders arriving attractively plated. However ultimately, we agreed that the quality/taste fell short of their presentation, as well as the expectations set by the price tag.

Of note from my friend's set dinners, the tuna tataki was a pleasant little salad and a good opener. The lobster tempura felt rubbery and bland, relying heavily on the batter. The anago oshizushi was not bad, but we felt that the rice was too densely pressed and way too firm in the mouth.

Of the aburi flight, I felt the shrimp was the best in exhibiting the freshness of the protein. The salmon, mackerel, and hamachi were borderline above average, and the beef, unremarkable. Where we were truly disappointed was the wagyu aburi. It tasted like a well-executed medium rare steak with a good sear. However, for something marketed and priced as ""wagyu"" (whether true wagyu or otherwise) we expected an extremely tender chew bordering on melt-in-your-mouth experience, for which it fell sharply short. The Boku maki (for which carries the restaurant's namesake) was okay. Lightly seared, a bit too much rice, and too much sauce, but still enjoyable and well put together.

It's difficult for me to comment on whether I'd come back, as I hadn't tried the sake or any of the sashimi/raw nigiri. Overall for this particular experience, I can only say that there are many alternatives that come to mind, whose corresponding offerings at the same price point are of a noticeably higher quality.",2018-02-16 07:25:38

I ordered the Hamburg mussels and the pancetta wrapped gnocchi (based on the other yelp reviews).  I loved the mussels!  They came in a cream sauce and were cooked very nicely.  my friends were laughing at me because the presentation was a little funny in that I had to fish my food out of a bucket.  I think they could've put a little less cream sauce in the ""bucket"" to make fishing the mussels out easier.

the gnocchi were less impressive to me.  they were a little tougher than I expected.  I usually love gnocchi because they are soft and doughy.  it was also served with big chunks of bread, which ended up being way too much bread. I probably wouldn't order this one again.

I also tried some of my friend's roasted vegetables -- delicious!  they were cooked just right so that they still had a slight crunch, but weren't too raw.  the seasoning was basic and allowed the flavor of the veggies to shine through.

And the name the D has to be the stupidest casino name yet.  I know they mean Downtown but there is absolutely no name retention with a letter.  The new modern look is actually pretty ugly, a combination between a glitzy office building and a brothel.  The red and white color scheme lacks cohesion.

What do I like about the Fitz (I mean the D)?  1) Marriage can be Murder is one of the best dinner theater programs I have ever seen.  The food is just ok but the show is a ton of fun.  2) The rewards club gives freeplay without requiring you to put your own money in the machine. 3) they still have several old machines which I prefer to the new 30+ lines and steal a coin to play for big bucks machines.  4) there is still a lot of cheap gaming although that may disappear to pay for the renovation.

The rest is the same.  Smokey, lots of slots, a few table games, mediocre food (although I heard Don B's is good, the rest are not worth trying)  The Fitz (I mean D) continues to feel like a trap for unsuspecting young partiers walking along freemont street.

The vaulted ceilings, dark wood furnishings and crisply uniformed staff contrast with the menu which is just bread and butter cafe food.  The signs outside the casino used to advertise a $3.99 breakfast, but they stopped offering it the month before we visited at the end of June according to our waiter.  Without the shelter of a special, the prices are a little high for the caliber of meals served here ($10 - 11  per dish without including tip).  $10.49 for the shrimp cocktail.... whuuuuut???   

My family tried the burgers with and without fries, belgian waffle with eggs and bacon and I had the Mediterranean frittata with a dry whole wheat English muffin.  The staff were very polite and brought our orders out in short time, but nothing about the frittata thrilled me.  They bake it in a small skillet and serve feta, spinach and tomato slices on top with a scattering of some bitter tasting sprouts and an overly honeyed muffin.  If they hadn't fixed on coming here I would have preferred the food court or some tortellini en brodo from Terra Rossa.  It also pays to check the tab when you get it.  We got charged for some sliders we never ordered and my aunt, while she found the total on the high side, didn't notice the mistake until she happened to glance at it after her visit.

Luckily we arrived with the famine level of two people who had just emerged from a week camping in rural northern Ontario with nothing to eat but spittle bugs and mint leaves, because the amount of food we ordered was obscene. Three dishes to share ($8 each), naan and rice. The naan was clearly baked only moments before being plated, unlike at some Indian restaurants where it's too aerated/porous and stale by the time it arrives at the table because it's been sitting around all night.

I also ordered a plate of spicy Chana Masala and I was barely able to make it halfway through it because I was too busy DEVOURING the Paneer Makhani I had also ordered - ""cubes of homemade cottage cheese simmered in tomato and cream sauce"".

Although drawn in by the large patio, we decided to sit inside to cool down. Because it was the weekend, the place was packed and football (soccer) and other sports games were displayed on TVs lining the walls. I really liked the laid-back but aesthetic industrial atmosphere.

We ordered two things to share: half-sized ($9.5) fully loaded nachos (full size is $19) and perogies ($8). The best out of the two was the perogies - loaded with potato and cheese and dressed with bacon, caramelized onion, and green onion slices, these are a must-try (I don't even know if you'll want to share them because they're that tasty). I found the nachos to be really good and different from your traditional nachos - sour cream, jack cheese, sliced olives, french onion slices, jalapenos, a sort of house sauce, avocado, and pulled chicken - I felt like this was a California-inspired plate.

Located in chill and artsy Liberty Village, LOCAL is a great stop for casual but classier pub-type food. It's, in my opinion, it's one of the best places in the area to watch a sports game at or to try before or after you catch a game at one of the nearby sports fields.",2017-07-22 18:23:48

Interior is small. You have to enter one way and will probably exit through the end of the store into a hallway. There's only about 3 tables. If you manage to nab a seat, it's definitely a cute place to just relax and study. The decor is very sleek, on theme and not cheap looking. 

Service was quite friendly, albeit slow. The front girl was cashing out, labelling, giving out samples, but also pouring the toppings and handing out the drinks as well. Therefore orders came in very slowly and we were slow to receive our drink which was just sitting on the counter for 2 minutes before I asked her if she could give it to us. 

The main factor: The bubble tea... It's... Different. It's a peculiar taste. I love the roasted milk tea at Chatime and love It at Coco as well. In my opinion it was watery and not silky smooth like CT. It was an ok bubble tea but what bothered me was that it was more expensive too. I had to add tapioca and my drink came out to $7 which is kind of ridiculous for a liquid.

The menu features a number of different preparations of udon including hot, cold, bukkake (cold noodles with broth), or the flavor-rich signature dishes. While I found the texture of the udon to be perfect, the broths and preparations were very hit or miss. Of the signature udons, the miso carbonara was rich and flavorful, but was quite heavy with the creamy white sauce and bacon. On the other hand, I also tried the duck nanban, which had deliciously tender pieces of duck, but the broth was so light and lacked any flavor once the few pieces of duck were gone. Double portions of udon are an extra $2, but cannot be applied to any of the signature udons. 

Other than noodles, they also feature some traditional appetizers including takoyaki (octopus balls), and fried chicken. Another shortcoming of Monzo is the hot tea, which only comes in a can.

I'll start out with positive words by saying the restaurant is beautiful, clean and a well thought out menu. Some of our dishes were yummy, inventive & creative - oxtail and the stuffed dates. The portion sizes are awesome and for strip prices it's suit to fit. 

The pitfalls of this establishment was the service. When I walked up to the hostess stand, a man in a suit (assuming a manager or a higher up) was stuck in his phone and the two hostesses were chatting. I had to interrupt them to let them know I was there. For the amount of money that you are paying, you can at least expect the server will inform you about the menu, what tapas are like (we had a newbie in the group) but it seemed to me the servers couldn't get out fast enough. I was eaves dropping on the table right beside me and heard they expressed the same concerns as their waiter was dull and uninterested. The food runners just dropped off the food, not a word, not what the dish was, an explanation how to eat it, not even eye contact. We asked a question and before we could get it out, their back was already turned walking away from us. I ordered a blah glass of sparkling wine and asked for a dash of elderflower (seriously like a bitters dash) and they said it would be a $3 up charge. On an already overpriced, not so tasty sparkling wine. No other restaurant I have ever been on the strip even bats an eye to that request because that's like asking for extra mint in your mojito. The vegetarian dishes were not good. The asparagus was bland, over priced and they shared the same sauce as the eggplant. The worst dish of the night was definitely the rice dessert. They burned sugar on top and stuffed in with sliced strawberries just to give it flavor because if it didn't have that, it'd be like eating hospital food. 

The worst part is as we were leaving, another gentleman in a suit behind the hostess stand and the hostess kept talking without thanking us, inviting us back or asking our feedback when we were exiting.

The fish broth was flavourful and not fishy. It was a touch salty for my preference but it wasn't overwhelmingly salty. Aside from your choice of toppings they also throw in some fresh green onions, mushrooms and parsley into the bowl.  It's a hefty meal to be honest.

Manchurian noodles were not right. They were kind of hard, barely any chicken - a couple random tiny pieces here and there. Not spicy AT ALL. And they weren't red...why? 

Garlic chicken, where is the garlic? Zero spice. Zero garlic. Mushy and not that good.

We've been visiting this park since the original WaterWorld days.  We had season passes when it reopened a couple years ago as Wet n Wild.  We didn't visit last year but did once this summer.  I was very pleased to see that they improved a few things since 2 seasons ago.

First improvement: a new ride - The Constrictor.  The kids (11 & 12yr old boys) thought it was the best ride in the park.  I can't comment as I did not try it.

Second improvement: Shade!  I was impressed with all the shade that was added over the faux grass / beach areas.

Third improvement: The entrance/exit to the wave pool.  I don't know how much of an improvement it was but the chaos seemed a little less.

Overall, this may be the best park in Phoenix.  I still prefer the ""real"" waves at Big Surf over the stupid swells of the the wave pool here, but the number of slides at Wet N Wild can't be beat in the Phx area.

I had ordered a Takoyaki and a Yakiudon. Had a friend order their Cold Tan Tan Noodles and her boyfriend ordered an Omusoba, another friend had ordered a fried rice. 

The cold tan tan noodles are different from any of the traditional ones you may find. this is more of a noodle salad vs the ramen style or sichuan style. Lots of veggies (lettuce and tomatoes) with a ""spicy"" dressing/sauce. 

Omusoba is a normal yakisoba with a okonomiyaki style egg/dressing wrapped like if its was an omurice. Friend had said it was good but too salty (apparently was a on-going trend being the noodles....)

The takoyaki was good. Freshly made and hot. Flavored well. Thoroughly cooked without any residual flour taste. 

Yakiudon. huge portion came out on a sizzling hot plate. overly salty. caused me to drink a lot of tea to balance it out. Otherwise would have been good. If you are a small eater, this may be big enough to share. 

Service was mediocre. Even when it wasnt busy. A lot of workers were just sitting/standing around and needed to be called on.

Decor: Overall, this venue has a nice sized general admission floor that is close to the stage. Every time I see a band here, I feel that I'm really close to them and love the experience I get here. They have decent restrooms, a good sized bar, a balcony area that has a special bar and seating, and a outside patio for smokers. Once in awhile, if the show is big enough, they will have a sausage guy there selling some bomb food.

Staff: Now, for me, I haven't had a single bad interaction with any of the security or staff here. I know they work hard to deal with drunk idiots who complain and write bad reviews when they act like children and get punished for it. The bar team is really nice, and pour nice sized drinks for a decent enough price.

Sound: I LOVE THE SOUND AND ACOUSTICS IN HERE! They have an amazing sound team that they should be proud of. I have never had a single complaint when it comes to this.

Overall: I will always come to this venue for future shows. I have 3 already paid for, and ready. I will say make sure you don't have a carebeaner or D-ring with you.

It's close to my home, it has a nice look to it, live music on Thursday (apparently), and not a big chain.  I discovered them because if you support KJZZ (NPR) you get a bonus here.  So we just had to check it out.

When we were seated the chips and salsa came as fast as we were sitting down.  I like that.  The salsa is a basic chili salsa. Very ordinary with chili flakes to make it spicy. Reminded me of enchilada sauce.  Chips seemed store bought, but they told us that they received ""homemade"" tortillas from a vendor and cut and fried them themselves.  OK.  I didn't ask about the salsa, but I think they'd do better with a pico de gallo. 

Nice bathroom. Music is appropriate (a Latin feel to it instead of top 40 like a lot of places have). 

The food came astonishingly fast.  I can't imagine that it was truly fresh.  Most places take up to 20 minutes to bring out the food.  This was out in less than 10.  How did they do that?  The portion was small.  Well, the burro (which is what I ordered) was maybe 2/3 the size of a Chipotle burro.  The rice and beans portions were reasonable.  The rice was good. The ""borracha beans"" were ordinary. The asada meat my wife ordered was really good. Rojo chicken (my burro) was not great.  Again, the rojo sauce seemed like an enchilada sauce, and that's what the chicken was cooked in (the burro itself was dry).

Because of the KJZZ support thing we got a free dessert.  The cheesecake in a jar was tasty, but they didn't make it!!  They order it from a vendor.  Makes me wonder what else they didn't make.

I think two stars is a bit harsh, but they really don't make it to three stars in my book.  I really wish Yelp; would let us choose half stars.  This is a solid 2.5 stars.  If the asada had been mediocre I'd say 2 stars, but the asada was really good.  Tasty and unlike a lot of places it seemed to be good quality meat (no gristle).  So two stars just wouldn't be fair.

I don't know if we'll be back.  We might try them one more time.  Maybe.",2015-04-08 00:02:46

I haven't heard the best things about this place from my friends that I've gone but I still wanted to give it a try. First things first they have an appetizer if that is a soft pretzel and it is hands-down the best thing ever. However that is pretty much the only good thing I have to say about it. The waiter that we had was not helpful at all. When we asked to hear about their specialty drinks and what they serve he just handed us a menu and walked away. Also when I told him I couldn't have dairy and I asked if a positive had cheese in it he said no and then he brought it to me and I was a cream-based dish and when I said I asked if you had cheese or dairy in it and you said no he goes I thought you just meant cheese. It is an amazing location with amazing potential. However I really hope they figure out the food to make it all that it's worth.,2017-11-11 00:13:07

We ordered off carts but the menu has tons of choices too. Their chow neon noodles were good but not a ton of flavor. Favorites were Seafood Rolls, Shrimp Balls, Shrimp & Pork ShuMai, and Won Tons. My husband picked something he thought was BBQ pork but ended to be Beef Tendons! They were surprisingly soft and tasty. The tea is such an important part of the meal and was very good too.

This venue is spread out in what seems to be over a mile from the Hilton to the southern most hall. For really large shows, the entire Convention Center, outdoors and the adjoining hotels are used. For more reasonable conventions, a piece of the convention center is used. 

The Monorail stops at both the South and North side and can actually be used to go from point A to Point B for really lazy people. 

Taxi's are an issue and the taxi line can consume over an hour. For, $60 a towncar will whisk you way for about an hour's worth of service. Make sure you get a driver who knows the back exits and shortcuts as sitting in traffic after attending or working a convention is painful.

The buffet offers naan, rice, a few vegetarian appetizers, and a variety of curries and other sauces, with a good mixture of meat vs. vegetarian options;  The spiciness of the different sauces was varied, with several dishes being quite mild and a few that were a bit spicier.  The chicken was tender, and the sauces were flavorful and delicious.  In addition, there was a small salad bar and a few desserts offered.  I had the rice pudding, which was good.  My main criticisms for the buffet itself were that it was a bit smaller than many other Indian buffets that I've been to.  Also, as far as meat offerings went, it appeared that only chicken dishes were available.  However, the taste of the food was good, better than most of the places I have been to in Cleveland.

Other thoughts:  The lay out of the restaurant was fine, I suppose fairly standard for a restaurant located in an office building.  The waitstaff were nice.  One other criticism I have, though, is that the location was a bit hidden, and there didn't seem to be enough parking available.

This is the closest one I can find to the ones I ate during my childhood. 

I had the Fesenjan for my entree ($12.95). It's a boneless chicken breast that is slow cooked with crushed walnuts and pomegranate sauce. It's served with basamati rice. I typically don't like eating a lot of chicken because I'm afraid it would be bland but this was bursting with flavor! It has a tangy sweet flavor to it.

Both visits were good.  My most recent one was for lunch and while the food was very good, I wish they had a more affordable lunch menu.  There was some service mishaps that prevented me from rating it the perfect 5 stars but I felt the food and the overall good service warranted a 4.

I ordered the Rogue burger and I didn't know they offered a Build Your Own Burger deal until after I ordered when one of the servers came by with flyers.  Like, wow - this would be something I would've done instead and something that should've been talked about right after being seated.  The Rogue burger was 14.50 and the BYO was 10.  I would've loved to save a little bit of money and eaten a burger I would've LOVED instead of just liked.

The burger was huge and I was not able to finish my meal.  Hubby had to step outside for a couple of minutes and I felt a sudden urge of sickness.  I don't believe it was food related but rather a small illness I was dealing with at the time.  Anyhoo, I went to the bar were my server and 2 others were and told them I needed to use the restroom but I wanted to take my leftovers home.  They all acknowledged me and I rushed to their restroom.

The ladies' room was clean but the regular stall has a broken lock.  The door thankfully stays shut without the lock and I was the only one there the entire time.  I'm not fond of their above-the-counter sink bowls as I found keeping all of the water inside while washing my hands was very difficult with where the faucet was.  It was just poorly designed in my opinion.

I must've been gone 10 minutes and my table has been completed bussed.  I was trying to find my server and a different one approaches me as I came out of the restroom to apologize for clearing my food and that she wanted to make a new full order for me to take home.  I wasn't even mad; I was just sad that I told 3 people that I was coming back and no one saved my leftovers.  I was still stuffed at that point and I felt that making a new order was excessive as I already finished 90% of my meal.  I pretty much said, thanks for being so generous but I'll pass this time.  My original server came back shortly after and again apologized for the mishap.  She took off my iced tea from the bill and gave me a new one to take home.  Again, I wasn't mad but appreciated the gesture.  And I wasn't looking for any compensation either.

I would love come back to try different stuff on the menu.  And now that I'm aware of the BYO burger, I'll make sure to ask for it next time.",2017-08-04 19:50:45

One plate I would like to recommend is El combo.  It comes with a LOT of food.  I usually only eat half and save the other half for lunch the next day.  It all comes with beef but you can sub chicken for any item at a cost of $0.25.  The hard taco and the Chalupa are best eaten that night.  The chili rellano could have more pepper in it.  

The margaritas are hit or miss.  Sometimes they will be strong and sometimes they will be a little weak.  On Mondays medium margaritas are $5.50 and they are pretty good sized.  I think on Thursdays they have beer on special.  

If it is your birthday, they let you wear a sombrero and give you a fried flour tortilla with a whip cream smiley face on it.  It may come with some syrup and a cherry too.  You do not get to keep the hat like I thought, they will chase you down and ask for it back.",2011-09-13 03:15:14

(Well, he had some help from his talented kitchen of course!)

I really didn't think the prices were that outrageous. It is more expensive than some off the Strip tapas, but not all. Most of the things I ordered were $8-$10 because I stuck to the vegetables, and honestly, I was like a herbivore in heaven. I had the brava potatoes, beet salad and sauteed spinach, and every single bite made me drool and smile. The brava potatoes were a grown girl's answer to her childhood french fry obsession. Yes, they were cubes, but they delivered the same happiness as a golden FF. The spicy tomato and alioli stood in for ketchup and mayo. The beet salad hit all the right notes of citrus and sweet, and the spinach was magically savory. I would order every one of those dishes again in a minute. 

My husband was in pescatarian heaven. I think he may have depleted a small sea somewhere with all of the ocean life he was served. He looked like a boy in a candy shop when the waitress dropped off his Mariscada, which is more of a dinner entree (lobster tail, head-on shrimp, scallop, mussels, clams on a savory meringue $35). It was a lot of creatures for $35, and he devoured them with a smile. 

The environment is open, airy and hip. Nothing to complain about, unless you are planning a break-up dinner. This is not the spot as everyone will know your business. Our service was fine, perhaps a little slow given the empty restaurant.   

Perhaps 5-stars should be going to M-Life because since the rolling out of this new program we have been living the M-Life in a large way, and once again, we decided to try a spot that under normal circumstance we may have thought a not so tasty value. However, with some M-Life credit, we were thrilled! Yes, this was a comped dinner thanks to the husband's M-Life. So taking that into consideration, I deduct a star for fairness, as comped things sometimes taste a bit sweeter.

This was our first visit to a Shula's Steak House and our expectation was that it would be comparable to Ruth Chris or Morton's but probably short of our favorite, Steak 44 at 44th & Camelback. 

Specifically, my wife loved her lobster bisque, ribeye and creme brulee trio.  She would rate Shula's with 5 stars.  I, on the other hand, thought my wedge salad was good and my ribeye was OK but a bit on the chewy side...not as tender and flavorful as hers, apparently.

All in all, 3.5 is fair but honestly I'd go 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable.  Shula's markets itself as a 5 star steak house but falls a bit short in my estimation.  In it's defense, the decor and the service are every bit 5 star.   But be warned this restaurant is inside a casino and the blast of nicotine, as you enter the casino to reach the restaurant, is disgusting if you're not or have ever been a smoker.",2016-12-24 14:47:23

Food: We ordered the Curry Goat Dinner, and a side of 1/4 Jerk Chicken (dark meat), and a side of Stew Chicken

Curry Goat Dinner - we ordered it with rice & peas, and curry potato. The portion was big, very filling, and tasted great. However, the goat meat could be a little more tender as it was somewhat chewy. Also, be mindful that some pieces may come with huge bones.

1/4 Jerk Chicken (dark meat) - it came with 3 pieces of meat, a pretty decent portion, and very well seasoned and a little bit hot

Stew Chicken - I've never had this before, but the flavour in this is STRONG with a little bit of smokiness. The meat of the chicken was stewed well where the meat easily falls off the bone.

So you get up from your table and go to order your food and pay before you eat.  2). you are told not to forget your table number. 3).  The cashier reminds you to pick up your silverware and napkins before you sit down. 4). They bring you your food which in my case was cold (if you like cold fries you are in luck). 5). You have to get back up from your meal and seat to get any condiments,  and don't forget any as you will have to get up again. 6).  No one checks in on you to see if everything is ok or offers to bring you more water. 7). After your meal you leave and no one notices you going or thanks you for your patronage.

Staff was pleasant any my order was ready when I got there. Interior seemed like a cozy spot at a Mom & Pop type joint. Note that they are only open until 5pm. 

For food we got:
*Combination Platter $16
*Grilled Platter $17
*Falafel Ball 65¢
*Spinach Pie $1.75
*kibbee Ball $2
*Baklava $1.25 

Honestly it was all just okay/mediocre. Not bad, but I've definitely had better. The kibbee ball and grape leaves were good, otherwise I don't get the hype surrounding this place. I didn't think the meats had much flavor to them and the falafel balls seemed very dry and overly fluffy inside. Hummus, baba ganoush, and baklava were all standard. Garlic sauce tasted like regular mayo. I actually felt really bad because my dining companion was so disappointed in the food. There were no seconds for us, we threw the leftovers in the trash. 

I am glad that I finally checked this place out, but I would probably not come here again. Cafe Falafel had really great veggie and grilled platters at lower prices. Oasis Cafe & Bakery is a hidden gem in Lakewood with delicious food all around. Ferris Deli has a great schwarma wrap and the garlic sauce is perfect to dip fries in. Falafel Express has a tasty kafta grill and staff is always nice. The Fountain Grill is good but pricey. Dolce Wraps is always a safe choice. Then for chains you have Aladdin's or Naf Naf Grill.

Many of the places didn't open until 5pm on Sunday and we were stuck driving around until we found Inaka Sushi.  We didn't know anything about the place but we decided just to go in since they were open.

I'll talk about the bad things later but I have to say I love this place and the food.

I decided to pay $20(lunch) for all you can eat sushi.  You must eat everything you order or else you'll be charged for the leftovers.  You also must eat within an hour.  I love the Americanized rolls so you can take this review as-is. The one thing I always look for in a sushi place is the Philadelphia Roll.   This place made the best tasting sushi I've had.  The fish wasn't room temperature.  It was cool and tasted fresh.  I then tried the Mountain Roll(Baked Salmon on California Roll with Mayo) tasted pretty good as well.   I also had the best Spider Roll(Soft Shell Crab Roll) here.  The crab was crunchy and taste pretty good.   I ended up having another order of Philadelphia Roll before I called it quits.  I had the green tea ice cream and it was also one of the best tasting i've had. 

The bad:
The Philadelphia Roll went for $9.99 for 8 pieces.  The pieces were bit on the small side but they were good.  Many of the rolls above are over $10.  The ice cream was $3.00 for one scoop.  If you going to go here, I suggest you do the all-you-can-eat because just ordering it a-la-carte isn't worth it.  Lunch is $20 and Dinner is $24.  If you're eatting over $20 worth of food, then this place is definitely awesome to go to.  

I had a lemonade and it cost me $4.50.  I don't know about you but even if  I get unlimited refills, $4.50 is definitely not worth it for me.  Stick to water imo.

Other than that, I love the place and will be coming back.  The people were nice and we even had a nice small chat to the waitress about where we were from.  Everytime someone came in, the chef knew their name so I am assuming this place gets alot of regulars.  If I didn't live 5 hours away, I would be a regular too.",2009-01-12 19:02:13

Sources I don't trust: 905ers on Yelp.), but Foxley always seemed to fly a little under my radar when it actually came time to answer the question ""What to eat tonight?""

I finally gave it a try and was very impressed, despite the polarizing reviews. For what it's worth, we took most of our server's recommendations and ordered: the crab and avocado salad; a Lao-style spicy beef salad; a wahoo and peach ceviche; fried shrimp with jalapenos and garlic; and red curry beef cheek. I thought the curry lacked some depth and spice but everything else was great, particularly the fish ceviche and crispy shrimp.

Portions are ample. I can (and do, with alarming regularity) take down a large pizza myself in 20 minutes when I'm hungry and I left Foxley very full. You should be pretty satisfied ordering 5 dishes between two people. By my math that's about $80 of food -- not exactly breaking the bank, so people here should stop complaining about portion sizes and just order one more dish for $12-$16 if you're still hungry.

He asked if we wanted him to just send out dishes, put them in the center of the table, and enjoy them family style.  We agreed to that.  Some table leaves were raised so we had more room for the 5 of us with plenty of room in the middle for our dishes.

We were given bread service and instead of butter, we were served this very tasty garlic creamy spread that was very good.  

In short order, we started with the appetizers.  We got eggplant parmigiana, calamari which contained some fried peppers and tomatoes and was served with a very spicy, very good tomato sauce.  We also got a platter of mozzarella that contained burrata, stracchino, bufala mozzarella along with two kinds pf prosciutto and some Italian tomatoes.

This was shortly followed by some meatballs in tomato sauce and a focaccia pizza which had mozzarella, crème fraîche, smoked salmon, chives, and red onion.  

Moving on to the entrée type plates, we got this huge--think the size of a large round pizza--bone in veal chop parmigiana.  The menu lists it as 12 ounces, but it had to be a lot more than that.  It was huge!  We also got osso buco with pappardelle and vegetable stew.  Accompanying these two dish were a lasagna and seafood risotto.  

We ended with four desserts--tiramisu, pear ricotta tart,  pannetone bread pudding, and baba au rhum.

Standout dishes for me were the calamari and the hot tomato sauce.  There was a lot of red pepper in the sauce and it had great zing to it.  The mozzarella platter with prosciutto was another good dish.  The osso buco was good and the pappardelle and sauce from the osso buco was very tasty.  The pounded veal parmigiana was good but I'm not that big a fan of veal parmigiana.  I credit Chef Febbraro with not breading his dishes to death.  The calamari and veal were nicely breaded.  

I did not try the baba au rhum because one of my dining mates let me know it was infused heavily with rum.  The other three desserts were good with the pear ricotta tart being the best.

Why stick with one large burger when you can mix it up with several small ones?  They have a good list of inventive burgers (more like small sandwiches, actually) to pick from or you can also create your own.  Burgers are à la carte with standard side offerings and while basic, the tots were salty, crispy and awesome.  The dipping sauces were a great touch.  Everything we ordered was fresh, well put together and well seasoned.   

Atmosphere was a bit lacking.  This place was dead on a Friday night.  Hopefully as the tourists roll back into town, they pick up.  The Ikea-inspired decor is a bit odd and the hospital-sterile white lights over every table are awful (dim them or invest in some warmer colored bulbs, guys).

I came with a few colleagues and ordered from a $16.99 prix fixe lunch menu, which came with an appetizer (I chose the corn), two tacos (I chose a carne asada and a tostada de ceviche for an additional +$1), and a dessert (I chose the iced tea flavoured paleta).

Alright, I admit, the price was a bit expensive since it all came to about $23 total but my oh my, it was SUCH a delicious meal!! Starting off with the Mexican-style corn on a cob, it was nicely dusted with seasoning, charred to a light brown, and drizzled with crema. The crunch was refreshing and sweet, and it really set the mood for the tacos, which were AMAZING. The carne asada (steak) was topped with a HUGE slice of avocado, which was the perfect creamy complement to the juicy and savoury steak. The tuna ceviche tostada was extremely fresh and flavourful and the softer texture of the ceviche paired really well with the crunch of the tostada. As you can tell, I was really impressed. 

However, the only pitfall of this meal was the dessert. The waitress had told me ""paleta"" meant ice cream so I was intrigued by the iced tea flavour - turns out, paleta means popsicle and they're supplied by Sweet Jesus. I've never had one before but I didn't enjoy mine - it was too sour and I regretted getting it. 

Overall, I would certainly come back for the tacos!!",2018-05-21 23:49:13

Speaking of their brioche pull apart rolls, do try them along with some of their tasty apple butter.  

I've also tried their ribs and fried chicken. The former were very good with a slightly unusual marinade that is citrusy and tangy. The fried chicken was crispy outside and very juicy inside.

The menu is quite large so I had a difficult time deciding, but ultimately chose the chickpea salad (Marinated chick peas served over a bed of lettuce, with sliced tomato, bell peppers and Calamata olives). It was decent, although quite oily and very garlicky - so be cautious if you're going to be going anywhere important after as you will certainly need to brush your teeth! The food was fine, but no one was overly impressed with their meal.

The interior is a bit run down / grubby, and this continues to the bathrooms (the ladies is located upstairs). Although we were a larger group, the service was a bit slow, especially considering that there were maybe two other groups there with two or three people in each.

Bar Cento is a large place with a very nice feel, dark and warm; the kind of place to hang out for a while.  The front room has a bunch of booths and the the bigger room has more tables and a large bar.

Service was friendly and prompt.  From the Happy Hour menu I ordered the Pizza Bianco ($5) and the Mussels ($7).   The pizza is a dinner plate sized hand stretched pie with garlic slices, oil and cheese.  The pie is thin and crisp with a very nice crust, a bit greasy, but in a good way and just the right amount of garlic.  

The mussels were a nice portion of medium sized shellfish in a mild wheat bier broth; the mussels were expertly cooked, firm without being overcooked and with a nice mellow flavor.   The crispy toast pieces were perfect to soak up the extra broth.

We went with 2 separate restaurant week orders which included deviled eggs, the BLT appetizer, the fried chicken plate, and the brisket sandwich.  We also added some very good crispy brussel sprouts, though they were a little salty, sticking to the Southern theme.  The deviled eggs came with some roe on top which as very unique, giving it a nice uniqueness than our typical deviled egg.  The BLT appetizer was actually quite good.  I didn't know what to expect but it was a thick, flavorful piece of pork belly on top of an apple?-flavored has brown.  Very good appetizer.  The brisket sandwich was good for a lunch but I'd steer towards the chicken at Yardbird.  The blue plate special is their specialty and either that or a chicken and waffle platter would be my recommendations.  Huge meals in total with a side of spicy watermelon and thick biscuit on the side.  The chicken was very tasty but not out-of-this-worldly.  It is one of the best on the strip but don't compare it to some old school grandma fried chicken.  I went for lunch so I wasn't drinking, but the beer list was really good and had a bunch of solid local options.  Overall Yardbird is one of the better lunch destinations on the strip.

After youre food is made, you finish off the process at the condiment bar.  I like the flexibility & freedom to top it with whatever you choose.

The good

The Cashier/Waitress, she was friendly and attentive not overly talkative and warm/welcoming but she did her job just fine representing the place 

The ingredients and the flavors. You can tell that they use quality ingredients and the flavors on the truffle fries and even my patty melt were good

The Bad

When I asked for Ice-T they didn't have any just had the honest tea half-and-half lemonade/iced tea in a bottle. I would think in today's age where people don't drink soda like they used to they would have a ice tea option maybe? If you're going to have Honest Tea in a bottle maybe should try just for the tea ones vs half-half

The price is very high and I get it they use quality ingredients. I got out of there for 17 bucks and I got the free truffle fries which would've been nine dollars more so would've been $26 for a burger/fries and drink and thx-tip. That's the same level of cost at the burger bar at Mandalay and for a local place, that's crazy, your flavors were good but you're never going to be on the level of the burger bar Mandalay

The real reason why this is a three star and not a four-star and probably should be a two star  is the actual cooking job on my burger. 

I asked for my burger medium and I don't have issues with medium rare, but this was so pink, the blood juices ran into the bread and made that near impossible to eat as it was falling apart in my hands. Still tasted good I wasn't going to send it back, but as I was about ready to leave I saw a man walked up and handed back his burger and said this is the pink in the middle and he has ordered medium....the same thing that was happening to me so obviously the cook has a major issue of understanding what medium is

I don't know maybe they're just having a bad night but there is only three people in there eating, so it's not like he was too busy to cook the hamburger all the way through

Like I said, good flavors and quality ingredients with ok service could have got this 4 stars with better execution and if it wasn't that tasty, would have been a 2 star

We decided to share the mac & cheese, not a fan of this AT ALL.

We could only take a few bites and had to stop. 

We shared some vanilla ice cream & it was perfect. The service was great all around. We did have quite a few different folks helping us, but they were all wonderful, and this didn't bother me at all. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the day while looking at all the cute doggies that were coming in. They are VERY dog friendly here, and I love that!

The girl was very kind, offering us samples on ice cream. I got to try Staberry and Caramel which were pretty good but a little too sweet to my taste. I went with Pistachio and I am glad I did. It had a very good amount of Pistachio in it and it was toasty.

The soup was a chicken broth base with some noodles. Good, but nothing special. The veggie crepe was very tasty, loaded with vegetables and very filling. Today, I sat outside on the patio. It is removed enough from the parking lot that it has a nice feel to it (I was the only one outside today, so it was especially nice for a quiet meal and some reading - yes, they have free WiFi). I had  the Grand Turk, a turkey crepe loaded with chunks of turkey and guacamole and some other ingredients (I had them skip the olives). This was outstanding!

Upon opening the door, I'm hit with this strong familiar aroma. And then I see every other table has a plate of fried tofu, and everything makes sense. It took a few minutes to acclimate to this environment, but after awhile you get used to it. Or you might not, I don't know.

In contrast to the overall decor, the menu is pretty nice in design: lots of pictures that showcase what you're getting.

I ordered a large beef noodle soup.

Bowls are served within 10 minutes. It comes with a dozen pieces of meat, which is pretty generous. They are also very tender to chew on, which is a must have. The broth itself is also quite clean, with very little grease in sight, with a nice subtle beef flavor. The noodles are thick and chewy, though I find that they are lacking in flavor.

It's a pretty good bowl of beef noodle soup. I would be interested to see how other places are.

There bubble tea isn't exactly bbt. It's like a latte and you have the option of hot or cold. I got cold which is basically hot with ice that waters it down which is also a bonus because it's sweet as all hell. That comes in a toilet bowl. How exciting! (Sarcasm)

I decided on a BYO burger - grass fed beef, pepper jack cheese, garlic aioli, mushrooms, and onions on a lettuce wrap.  The (iceberg) lettuce bun was plentiful and tightly secured with a long toothpick. I did enjoy this burger, but thought the patty could use a bit more seasoning & more mushrooms (I only found 2 small mushroom slices on my burger). It was also a bit costly at $14 after I added the toppings- I think some toppings, like sliced onion, sliced tomato, or pickle slices (pickles aren't listed as a topping choice oddly) should be free toppings because the burger itself is already upwards of $10 with no toppings.

Instead of fries or chips, I got a half portion of Greek salad- it was very good and a nice bowl portion. It had feta cheese, Kalimantan olives, cucumbers, sliced banana peppers, and tomatoes.  I really enjoyed the Greek dressing, though it was very sweet!

The place: I love it. It reminds me of a humble beach shack that you'd find in Mexico or California. Escondite boasts a super cozy, warm vibe without any pretense. Dimly lit, wood, cozy seating and great art scattered across the room. Admittedly, one of the reasons I wanted to check this place out is because local artist Miss Me painted a massive mural at the back of the room and I needed to snap it.

The goods: My fellow Yelper and I both ordered the Mojito del'King and HELLO, we weren't disappointed. It was awesome. The fresh mint was a great touch. On the menu:

Guacamole w/home-made tortillas: Very good. The guacamole could have used a bit more seasoning but this probably comes down to personal preference. The tortillas were crispy and light, but not oily.

Baja tacos (crispy cod, avocado crema, cabbage slaw): Great! The fish was flaky and perfectly cooked.

Ceviche de Camarones (plantain shrimp ceviche, cucumber, red onion, Serrano, oranges, plantain): Delicious! I think this was my favorite dish - it was light and fresh, and bursting with flavor. 

We also had a beet salad that I don't see on their online menu. It was pretty good. For dessert, we had Churros with Nutella - YUM!

Service: Because I procrastinated in writing this review, I forget our waiter's name. All I can say is that he was awesome. Super friendly, knowledgeable and willing to make suggestions. This guy knows what customer service is all about. 

Price point: With tip, it cost each of us about $44. While this is a tapas place, I found the portions to be pretty generous, and I'd say that if you were solo, you could easily get by on 1-2 tapas. Unless you're like, a Sumo wrestler. Then you might want to order more.

In the summer, spring, and fall, the terrace is a beautiful lakeside hangout that appeals to just about anyone who loves a little outdoors time.  Whether you want to go for a walk down the scenic path, sit at a table with friends and enjoy a pitcher of authentic Wisconsin beer, listen to a live band, or watch a movie on the big screen, the terrace can provide it.  It tends to support a large crowd, especially on nicer nights, but if you're ok with a lot of socializing and possibly some music playing, your in for a fantastic treat.

Almost everyone I've brought here in the 19 on and off years I've lived in Madison has loved it.  I think part of the appeal is that people are always in such good spirits down there, with the combination of the view, the campus, and Madison's personalities.  The bands that play on weekends can vary, so it's helpful to look some of that info up ahead of time if you're in the mood for a specific genre.  I've heard everything from latin jazz to rap to metal, to alternative, etc.  The movies play during a good portion of the summer, and a lot of them are college classics but there is a rogue pick or two mixed in (I think their is some kind of voting system you can be a part of to decide which movies but I honestly can't remember)

You can also rent boats, and the Terrace is just a block away from state street.

As we all know, the pho business is quite competitive, especially in this Asian mecca of town.  Survive on cheesy and perverted marketing, I say! ;-)

Please redeem yourself, it's just embarrassing! Restore honor in the name of the Pho# community, which extends all the way to SoCal.  

It was this 2-star recipe that I observed:

1) Adding a dash of Black Pepper before my pho bowl arrives. Who does that? Trust me, nobody in my pho eating career have I seen this.  You either: a) believed your broth lacked flavors b) thought it was cool and tried to be different? If needed, we can use the shakers that was already sitting on the table. Clearly, a Pho Faux Pas.

It threw everything off.  Slurp after slurp was quite painful.  The identity of the broth was more evident once I added the hoisin and siracha: bland-ish.  Hence the BP? *face palm*

2) Empty Tables and Chairs.  Clearly, this was a dead giveaway but I was semi hopeful that the Pho Gods would bring me good tasting fortunes on this great Sunday afternoon. *face palm*

3) SERVICE was so SLOOOOW, I thought at several points TIME itself had STOPPED.  In comparison to some legendary Viet places I know, I get my cup of water the second I sit down or atleast within reasonable time.  10 minutes before taking order, 10 more minutes for beverage to arrive. *face palm*

If you are truly a Pho place, it shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to deliver a bowl of Pho.  In fact, the vegetables took just as long to come out.  The anti-freshness did not help either! You would think being directly linked to an Asian Grocery would help in that regard.  *face palm*

No excuse for slowness when the place is half full.

Another thing, please invest in better Rooster and Hoisin sauces, not your mysterious, generic bottle.  *face palm*

All of this face palming has caused my face to go numb! The only way I would return is if a ONE was added to the restaurant number.  By then I would expect an enhancement in the food and possibly a scandalous atmosphere. ;-)

The food is good not great but good. I had the tri-tip and it was slightly dry and a little chewy. Our server, Nick W was great and had great recommendations. He recommended the pulled pork which my husband had and after trying it I was sorry I hadn't gotten that. The beans were delicious sweet not spicy, and the mac-n-cheese was creamy but could have been cheesier. My mother had the chicken wings, nude and said they were just okay. Her onion rings were good but a little greasier than I would have liked them. They have a good selection of beers. The atmosphere is industrial and very casual.",2016-02-16 16:56:21

A once dreaded experience of searching for secure parking and getting to the airport on time has been turned into an experience where the normal hassles are eliminated. 

They offer covered parking. Spaces are not crammed together. Shuttle driver helps you with your bags immediately and pulls up right when you park (no wasted time - perfect for a commuter who is normally cutting it close to get to the gate). 

The icing on the cake is really the Paradise cookie voucher - a sweet treat to top off the experience. Again, when do you get rewarded with a free cookie just for doing something as mundane as parking your car?",2013-12-11 18:57:13

Separating themselves from the many All-You-Can-Eat Japanese restaurants around the area, Inatei offers an assortment of appetizers, sunomono (vinegared dishes), sashimis, sushi rolls and robata-yakis (Off the grill).  For those who prefer a more fulfilling hot dishes, Inatei also has a variety of set dinners and bento boxes. They also offer bento box for vegetarians. 

I tried the Ume bento box and it came with unagi, chicken teriyaki and a choice of hand roll or sushi roll. Both unagi and chicken were very well marinated and just the right portion. Their sushis had a nice balance of rice and condiments, They sushi stays intact even when you pick them up with your chopsticks.  

Generally, I think Inatei is fairly priced, considering the quality that you get, approximately $10-15 for lunch or $20-30 for dinner per person. Staffs were polite and well trained. They know what to recommend you and always at a reachable distance to make sure your needs are taken care of. Overall, I enjoy dining at Inatei.

DmIcAxbCyG1TLQgBlAkdFQ,tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,wWuGa3OOQJro_XGe-GKBXA,5,10,2,7,"My sister decided to take me to Kabuto for dinner since I keep raving about it.  I made a 6pm reservation at 3pm to secure a spot at the bar.  The place is immaculate, no splotches of soy sauce anywhere, not a speck of dust.  Kabuto embodies what a real Japanese restaurant is: clean, beautifully simple and pure.

If you're an ultra fan of AYCE sushi places that serve deep-fried rolls, rolls with spicy mayo (bastardized sushi, in short) - this may not be the place for you.  Now, I say that only because I've actually stood in line at 5am at Tsukiji Fish Market to watch a tuna auction and have had fresh sushi at 6am in Japan - nobody served Cali rolls or tempura rolls.  I like both the purist version and the bastardized version.  To find a Japanese restaurant in Vegas that serves fish, rice, wasabi and soy sauce (and nothing else) as sushi is rare.  You won't get wasabi or a small saucer to pour soy sauce in - all that will be taken care of by the sushi chef (Sushi Etiquette 101: do not dip rice onto soy sauce; put wasabi on top of the fish not into the soy sauce).

The whole time I was at Kabuto, all I could do was smile as I watch the sushi chef delicately slice up some fish.  I had Bach's ""Cello Suite No. 1"" playing in my head because the experience will remind you of ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"".  

I had the 4 of the o-toro (premium fatty tuna), kamashita, chu-toro (medium fatty tuna), anago (eel), akami (tuna), ikura (salmon roe), zuke (tuna marinated in special soy) and gyoku (sweet egg).  I don't normally like eel.  My sister (who likes eel)ordered it but she  was afraid to eat it maybe because it wasn't covered in eel sauce.  I liked it...well, I liked everything I ate!  It's sushi in which the fresh fish is the main event (as it should) and rice is just an add-on.

My sister, however, had a different experience from mine.  She didn't hear a cello playing in her head.  She had that worried look.  I asked her what's wrong and she told me, ""I'm just not an adventurous eater.""  So, I quickly ordered dessert so I could take her somewhere else.  Poor thing.

I had the matcha cake.  It's a green tea chiffon cake with a hint of red bean.  It's mildly flavored and not sweet at all.

Now, if you're from Seattle...Kabuto is similar to Shiro's. Oishi! Gochisosama!",2012-10-23 17:16:11

A popular place made famous of gourmet pork burgers in dark alleyways, celebrity sitings, a Top Chef Canada finalist and an absolutely sinful Duck Fat Poutine in Truffle Gravy, this resto keeps outdoing itself under the masterful touch of Chef Connie DeSouza.  

I had finally tried it as a surprise for my birthday.  I had been wanting to try it for the longest time, but just hadn't found an opportunity.... until I suddenly found myself there.

To start with the duck fat fried poutine in the absolutely divine truffle sauce was something to behold.  The subtle earthy notes in the sauce more than accentuated the fries, it's flavour enhanced by the wild flavour of the duck fat.  Literally oozing with flavour, I had dreams of another masterful chefs Foie Gras Poutine of Chef Martin Picard in Montreal.  Rich... sooo rich and something for the bucket list for everyone.

Next, I tried a wonderful cut of pork belly while my companion had a brilliant grilled wild trout and tuna dish served in a jar.  She still remembers the lemon notes int he flavour, while I simply recall my face matching Homer Simpson's face when confronted by a donut shop.

It just was so much and so rich... and I just had to stop before dinner.  I still want to try the bone marrow appetizer I keep hearing about, and the little pig shaped clip to a Top Chef postcard was a cute souvenir touch.",2012-05-13 04:15:33

Marquee does attract famous Djs every weekend.  Best advice is to get your ticket online and come here early as with any other major club in Vegas.  If not, you could give a bouncer some cash.  My friend and I thought we were out of luck with no online ticket, no guestlist, and not staying at Cosmo.  But the bouncer casually asked us to give him cash and we would get in without issue.  AND it worked! 

Two dance floors.  The major one is for EDM and the smaller one is for hip pop.  Both are nearly impossible to move around when packed.  The outside pool area is pretty nice but once its crowded, it's not so fun.  The visuals and the effects at the main dance floor is pretty nuts.  Now the layout of the venue is top floor pool and main EDM stage and then lower floor is the smaller hip pop room and a secluded bar.  Pretty simple right?

Prices are on the higher side

Ten Ren's is one of my wife's favourite places to go.  This location is there flagship one so it's easily the biggest and has the most amount of items to choose from.  There are plenty of seats that can accommodate all sorts of groups here.  I've attended birthday groups of 20+ people here without much problem as long as you call ahead so they can prepare.

Ten Ren's has a lot of drinks to choose from.  From herbal to milk, there's a huge amount of different teas to choose from.  If you love tea as much as my wife does, you'll love this place.  They have a lot of food to choose from as well.  Most of it is ""tea flavoured"" to some extent.  They have combos to choose from which include an entree, drink, side dish and dessert.  

My biggest gripe about this place is the prices.  They are definitely on the higher side.  You're paying a premium for the Ten Ren's name I guess.  The side dishes prices irk me the most.  Some of the side dishes are as expensive as an entree.  I've ordered two entrees before instead of an entree and a side dish because I think that's what gets me the biggest bang for my buck.  If the prices were a little better, this would be a 5 star for me.

The service here has always been good every time I come.  They hire enough staff to service the large amount of tables they have here.  On weekends the place is very busy but I've never had trouble getting service on weekends.

Eventually, when the crowds died down, I decided to give this American chain's first Canadian store a chance. And I tried a couple more times. But I really just can't stand this place.

First off, their clothes are the cheapest quality I've ever encountered. I only have moderate sewing experience but even I can see when the sweatshop workers messed up a seam. Cheap materials, crappy sewing jobs in third world countries...not cool.

And maybe it's just this location, but any of the ""fashion forward"" stuff seems to fly off the shelves in minutes, leaving only sleazy club gear like dresses that look like shirts and metallic stretchy things. When I went to the stores in the States, they had wayyy more selection and better looking stuff in general.

Plus the layout of this store is annoying as hell. It was annoying when it was the Gap, and it's even more irritating now that it's filled with fashionista tourist teenagers and their moms (and sometimes dads). Stairs in the middle of the floor and too many clothing racks shoved into an already small space. And the tables are always a mess -- I am not going to pick through piles of clothes in the hopes that I'll find one shirt.

My last gripe -- NO RETURNS. That's the surefire way to know that the store can't stand behind the quality of its clothing. Once you buy it, it's yours forever, even if it falls apart after you wear it once, and even if you don't want to wait in a lineup to try it on. I cherish my freedom of having the option to return things, and Forever 21 tries to take that away from me. Well, forget you, Forever 21. I'm not 21 anymore, anyways.",2009-01-07 20:57:24

VseulA5gPddU2Zbyc6rkOA,-RhRXVW9z9fs5zzxhFfnHg,-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,3,3,3,1,"Really disappointed with this place.  Actually, I shouldn't say that I am wholly disappointed with the place as much as I am disappointed with the quality of service that I get for the outrageous price.

The wife and I weren't terribly hungry (after a killer breakfast from another of FRC's spots - True Food) but it was lunch time and we weren't going to have a chance to eat again till much later so we wandered over to Zin burger.  Cool place.  Nice inside.  Looks like most of the newer FRC places.  Good vibe, crazy walls, wicked wait for a burger place.

So we each got a milkshake and then split an order of sweet potato fries and a bacon burger.  The milkshake was a double chocolate mint shake that was excellent.  I didn't think the $6 price tag was outrageous but when it came out and only 1/4 inch of my spoon was sticking out of the glass, I was a bit annoyed.  You know you have shakes, you are the ones who bought the glasses, maybe buy some shake spoons?  For $6 I shouldn't have to fish it out.  Anyways, it was good.  Better than most restaurant shakes, so I was happy.

The fries came out next.  Thought it was a bit odd since we didn't order them separately but I guess the waiter thought they were our appetizer.  The yogurt dipping sauce is very tart by itself but it a perfect compliment to the fries.  The fries are also bathed in salt so I enjoyed them very much.  In all, the fries were good but the presentation was pretty cheap.  The ramekin of yogurt was sitting on the fries inside the paper-lined basket.  It had spilled on the fries.  I'd prefer a plate.

Finally (and I do mean FINALLY...like 35 minutes after ordering), the burger came out.  It had been cut in half, which I appreciated.  It was cooked to a perfect medium and was pretty tasty.  We gad ordered the Samburger because my wife likes bacon but I really wasn't feeling that bacon.  I wished it had the turkey bacon from True Food because the Applewood Smoked bacon that was on there was hard and tasteless.  In all, it was a good burger.  Was it a good $10 burger?  Not really, but half is enough to fill you up, and if you split it, it is only a $5 burger.  For $5, it is great!

Now to my final complaint and the thing that would normally make me turn this into a 2 star review but I know that they are going to fix it.  Despite their intention to fix it, it was still left this way and still screwed up my experience.  If you sit in one of the booths behind the hostess table, you have a perfect view of the men's bathroom door.  No big deal except, and this is a big except, when someone opens that door to go in...you get a full on view of someone using the urinal.  Now that kind of thing might fly over around 7th Ave & Indian School but not at Biltmore and not for these prices.  I do not want to watch people urinate and do all of the other things that guys do while they are in the bathroom while I am eating.  I'm sorry but it was gross.

Lastly, don't have Harold as your waiter.  He was snotty, insistent, and inattentive.  He took plates before we were done, had an attitude when we asked to split the burger, and continually ignored us as he attended to the larger (and subsequently more lucrative) table next to us.

I might give Zinburger another chance but in reality, there are enough burger places along Camelback (Modern Burger, Grind, Culvers, Smashburger, Wineburger, etc) to keep me occupied for a while.",2010-03-30 21:29:43

I went back on the first day they reopened and got an Americano. Still amazing! I love their espresso and they are so good at what they do. They use a traditional espresso machine rather than the modern day push button type, and the richness and flavour of the espresso comes through. It's just so delicious!

I'm so pleased to see that they have all the same favourites on the menu, and a few new items I can't wait to try (biscuits and gravy!!!!) I had the salmon benedict today and I have to say it was better than I remember. The soft poached egg was done PERFECTLY. 

The space has the same character and charm as before but it is brighter. Floors are refinished, benches are removed with a new one at the back of the restaurant. There is a new bar style seating area near the food prep. All the wall decorations are right back where they were before. Honestly, if you weren't a regular here I don't think you'd even know exactly what they changed but to say that it just looks and feels more spacious. 

Also really great to see that many of the same staff are back. That is saying a lot for this restaurant because the turn around for this type of industry is massive. They are clearly passionate about this place and love working together as a team.

The prime rib was unfortunately too dry for me but all of the other food was good in regards to other buffets. My wife was all over the crab legs, my son was all about the Italian and the dessert bar.

I don't like big, loud, douchey nightclubs, and it would be stupid for me to write bad reviews on other ones I've been to (I won't be writing one on Haze at the Aria, which I was also at on this debaucheries LV weekend) when it's the entire scene in general that's not up my ally. It's like giving a bad review to an Italian restaurant when you don't like Italian food in the first place. 

Anyways, if you like nightclubs and wanna go to one in Vegas, I'd make this my choice. It's HUGE, beautiful, and has a completely different vibe in different rooms/floors so there's something for everyone. Honestly, I know there's a lot more to this place that I didn't get to check out, but what I saw I liked. The pool area was gorgeous and there was lots of room to sit & mingle w/friends. I'm not a big fan of electronic music, but this area was huge as well. Later in the night (well...early morning) I checked out the hip-hop area and adjacent patio, which was also a lot of fun. 

I can talk about lines, cover charges, rude bouncers (which I didn't experience here...stand-offish, yes...but not ""rude""), but at the end of the day that's the Vegas club scene so you probably already know that if you're bothering to read this review. Plus, everyone has a different experience when dealing w/promoters (if you go that route) so the logistics of Marquee is hard to comment on. I will say the drinks are expensive in general, but on par w/Vegas standards (as far as in night clubs). Of course you can always sneak a flask in (who, me?). 

At the end of the day, Marquee is a nice nightclub and if you're gonna do the club scene in Vegas I would recommend it. If you absolutely detest this whole scene, however, I don't think this place is necessarily gonna make you convert so I'd definitely come prepared to deal w/douchebags.

I went in and noticed some new additions to the menu. Two caught my eye but I decided on the Bahn Mi. Which was...amazing. This place is redeemed for me. The pork belly came sizzling off the grill and into my sandwich. The radish and jalapeño added a great cool crunch. The sandwich was a medley of all the flavors you would want in a sandwich, sweet and salty, crunchy, warm pork belly, nicely dressed bread. Yum. I can't wait to come back and try the other sandwich I was interested in.

For 9 dollars the price of a sandwich is a little steep. But I believe it is good quality meat and the meat they use you can see in their display case. This is a great place to go if you are interested in different/not some common cuts of meat. Though their case is small it has a good diversity and everything was nicely labeled.

Deliciousness - 2.5/5

This place is fine, but underwhelming. I have really enjoyed the other concepts by this company (like Crab and Mermaid and Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers), but 48 fails to meet those standards.

I came in at 11:30 on a work day and I believe only one other table was seated. The menu has lots of interesting stuff on it (like mac and cheese baked in a waffle iron). But honestly, none of the food was very exciting when we finally got it. I ended up ordering the steak sandwich and it was bland (except for the cheese, which was great). My wife got the Tennessee hot chicken sandwich and the heat level left a lot to be desired (i.e., pretty mild). Again, it wasn't bad, just underwhelming. The ranch dressing also had a somewhat offputting tangy taste. 

The oddest thing was that they marketed a monster bloody mary.... and it only came with olives and the lime/lemon (it's supposed to have bacon too, but we ordered without due to not eating pork). Those are very normal toppings for a bloody mary. Also, they only gave two olives. I feel like when you forego the most exciting thing in the bloody mary (the bacon, in this case), they should be willing to overload you with olives so that it still impresses!

The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating to our requests, but disappeared for long stretches of time. I ended up having to change my order to something else and they charged me for the cheaper of the two entrees, which was very thoughtful.

But when we walked in, the TVs were tuned to a Yankees baseball game (go Yankees!) and as we were the only ones in the section, we were really enjoying it. Then, before the game was over, they switched all the TVs in our section (again, with us the only customers there) to  lacrosse. I mentioned that I was watching the game and the waitress said sorry (but did not offer to change it back). Not terrible, but just an odd thing to do.

Sahara and Durango), serving up homey but flavorful Thai and Chinese food without the fancy culinary flare.  That is how I would describe King & I Restaurant.

Frankly, I think the location of the business is far from ideal, given the very limited car and foot traffic on the residential street it is situated in.  However, the restaurant has been in business since at least 1996 when it earned its first ""The Best of Las Vegas"" award and presumably is still operating on the same spot, so they must be doing something right.

They offer $7.95 lunch specials from 11am-3:30pm.  Besides their usual lunch specials, on each weekday there is a unique lunch special, and on Saturdays, all the weekday lunch specials are available.  I guess for those that work or live nearby, you can keep coming back and order something different every visit and not get bored.  

My review is based upon my recent dinner visit to use up a Groupon I bought for K&I before it expires.  And overall, I was satisfied with my meal and the service provided.  I thought the price was reasonable for the portion served, as well as, on par with other Thai restaurants in the area.  The food I ordered was tasty. However, I thought that the culinary skills of the cooks preparing the food were just average, so on a typical day you are getting your average mom and pop-type restaurant food.

Yum Woon Sen (I have seen it translated as Thai Glass Noodle Salad at other Thai restaurants).  It is a salad composed of shrimp, chicken and clear/glass noodles flavored with spicy lemon juice. It costs $9.95, but is large enough to serve as an entrée salad for one average person, or plenty to split for 2.  I liked it, and can see myself ordering this as a small dinner.

Panang (Sweet) Curry - $9.95.  Choice of beef or chicken ($11.95 for shrimp), sautéed with kaffir lime leaves, bell peppers, coconut milk and peanut butter sauce.  It was good, plenty of chicken and a lot of curry to go with the rice until you are full.

Thai Iced Tea - $2.50.  If my one and only Thai Iced Tea is the typical glass served to every customer, then it is one of the better ones I found served in local Thai restaurants.  It is not overly sweet like at many other restaurants, but no refills (hats off still to The Original Thai BBQ on S.Jones for the generous refills).

Service was adequate and pleasant.  It was nothing special or extraordinary, especially considering that I was dining alone and the restaurant wasn't packed to capacity.  My food order was taken, and when it was prepared it was delivered to the table while it was still hot.  

I didn't have room for desserts, but their selection of premade European style desserts (tiramisu, European Pie, Manhattan Truffle, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake) priced in the range of $3 to $4.55 had no effect on my typical urge to consume sweets before, during or after a meal.

Ambiance: 2/5  Just a small restaurant with Thai decorations here and there, with the bulk of it mostly out of view towards the back hallway leading to the kitchen.  I did felt relatively relaxed looking at the guppies and angelfish swimming in the small fish tank during dinner.
Food:  3/5  Typical mom and pop Thai food at average price with nice portions.
Service:  3/5  Adequate and pleasant.
Price:  3/5  Some items cost more than other Thai restaurants in the SW Las Vegas area, while others is cheaper.  But overall it is pretty comparable.

My point: don't skimp and get a cheaper, lesser hotel - get the best your budget allows.

Probably the one thing about Aria I don't like is that its direct neighbors in City Center are not as interesting as they could be.

I will admit, I've only been once but can't wait to go back. 
The decor is old school and unapologetically simple. 
They give you a napkin on the table from the dispenser on the table (like......WAFFLE HOUSE), LOL. 

Cooking is akin to my Uncle Sylvester (Seal). what do I mean: Big hunk of fresh baked bread. No one cares about a calorie/heart disease/belly fat/digestive issues. Just order, honey! 

I got the breakfast steak and the waitress (a real adult meaning she's more than 40+) and I worked it out to just order the Lunch steak offering. Those potatoes were as chalked full of flavor & butter that I looked around for my Uncle Seal. It tasted like he was cooking. 

Didn't want my bread plain with cold butter smothering it. So she took it back on a napkin from my table and had 'em grill it. Umm ummm good!

Normally, I'd be irked about cleanliness or proper manners but it's an unassuming place and you get down to earth folks - so it was ok with me. had to leave to go get cash from the UW machine @ the BP but no worries with them. get back when you can. Then she tells me, ""he makes his own bread."" I could have proposed to him then. Instead, I'll patronize again and my sorority sister was as impressed. The Yelpers got it right all over again!

Parking is a little limited close to the main shops area, but there is a three level parking garage. I have to admit, I'm usually suspicious of any franchised restaurant, but I'm a fan of Jack Astor's. They have a fun and changing menu with some great hits. They also have a great, comfortable atmosphere. 

The servers were quick and efficient, however the kitchen was not that day. Several tables around us were getting anxious for their meal, while we were just happy to be having beers outside on a beautiful day. Next thing we knew the manager was coming out with little mini margaritas for everyone to apologize for the wait. Beer and margaritas? Well done Jack. The margaritas were so good, that we asked for the recipe! Our meal came shorty afterwards and was quite delicious. I had the tortilla crunch burger. It had a nice balance of toppings with the guac, feta, tomatoes and tortilla chips all working together. I love guac on a burger and the tortilla chips added a really nice crunch to what would have otherwise been a mush on mush on mush. My dinnermate had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich, and it must have been good, because I only manage to wrestle some fries off of his plate.

When I called, the host on the other end very rudely said the kitchen was too swamped and couldn't get another order in.  The best he could do was put my order in at 9:30pm.  There was no apology or anything just a response like ""better luck next time.""  It seemed very rude and not the type of customer service I experienced last time I was there.  I then tried ordering through Yelp as that seemed like a nice alternative.  We placed the order through the app and received a message from Yelp 15 minutes later saying they could not get in touch with the restaurant after trying several times.

I ordered 2 enchiladas, I got the green pork because I don't mind it. I asked him to put house dressing on top and I had to correct him before he poured the green sauce on it. Then after it went though the warmer, it sat there while I waited for someone to pull it off and bring it to the end where they put the lettuce, pico, rice and beans. They took another guys food and made his while mine sat there, while both employees at the end acted busy and tended to another customer who was in line after me. Then after waiting he finally gets it and I ask for lettuce and pico, he piles the lettuce on the whole thing and asks if I want more.... no but I did want rice and beans which clearly there won't be room for now that the whole dish is covered in lettuce. So he puts a load of rice and then proceeds to pick up black beans after I told him pinto, which I saved in time again to correct him.

I heard the special rolls were good here, so we went and ordered 5 of them - spider and dynamite which was part of a combo plate, Chicago, Yoko special, and the spicy scallop roll. We have done this at many other restaurants and have enjoyed doing this as some of us really like the rolls. At most places special rolls are different but Yoko's special rolls are all identical, with tempura yam, avocado, cucumber, tobiko being present in all the rolls we ordered minus the spicy scallop. 

The rolls itself were actually pretty good, there isn't too much rice, and the shrimp tempura, soft-shell crab and the yam tempuras were all nice and crispy. But I must say that the biggest problem here at Yoko, was that all those rolls were absolutely drenched with a sweet soy-based sauce, making the rolls slightly soggy and masking the flavour and textures of the rolls. For example, the chicago, Yoko, and spider rolls were only distinguished by the shrimp tempura, unagi, and the soft-shell crab respectively, but there was no way you could tell the difference when all you could taste was the sweetness of the sauce (which was made even worse by the fact that the yam is also very very prominent and sweet. It would be nice to have a creamy mayo based sauce instead. The spicy scallop roll also failed to impress as it was mostly bread crumbs. But full marks for actually making a roll where there was a bit of kick to it!

We told the staff the sauce was overwhelming and the rolls were way too similar to each other but was told that customers wanted more sauce and that if they didn't want sauce to indicate when ordering, but there was no way to know this beforehand. The lady that took our order did tell us that the rolls would taste similar but I didn't expect that four of the five of the rolls would turn up identical from each other. I should note that the Chicago and Yoko special rolls didn't end up looking anything like pictures on the menu. 

I'm really disappointed overall in Yoko but if you do end up coming here, ask them to lay off on the sauce and I think you'll have a lot better experience than I did.",2016-10-30 03:09:31

After getting the runaround from 3 different Toyota dealerships (1 in town, 2 in CA), I started looking online at carmax.com.  I saw a Honda Ridgeline truck with fairly low miles and at a low price.  I booked an appointment online and went into the store and met with Rocky.

They gave me 3x the amount for my trade than what Toyota was offering.  And an interest rate almost HALF of what Toyota was offering!

My salesman Rocky was great- he was very personable and courteous.  Whereas most salesman give off a strong arm vibe, Rocky made it seem like he truly wanted to help me get the best deal.  Also I was in and out of there within 1.5 hours- no making me wait forever at a table while the deal went back and forth like most dealerships.

I can't say enough about how great this experience was- definitely check them out first when looking for a used car.  If nothing else, get an offer for your trade-in, it will probably be a lot higher than what the shady dealerships are offering!

First off, Sweetie is the largest candy store in North America. Yes, that's right. The biggest candy store in the US is right here in Cleveland. I'll be the first to admit- I went into Sweetie with absolutely no game plan in mind. When I walked in, I was so visually stunned. There's literal walls and walls and aisles and aisles of any candy you could ever imagine. Prior to my visit, I wish I would've consulted a buzzfeed article on the best childhood candies.

The first wall to greet you is a giant wall of old school sodas of well known brands and completely wacky flavors (ranch dressing soda?!). Not only can you find anything you want in the aisles, but they do interesting bulk candy. So if you need things in bulk for a party or wedding, this should be your first stop. They also have a new ice cream/soda shoppe. I didn't get to check it out because it was so crowded, but it looked pristine and super inviting.

One of my favorite things about this place is the diversity of its customers. Everyone literally becomes a kid in a candy store.

As this restaurant is BYOB, we brought a bottle of red, and the waitress quickly supplied a corkscrew and glasses.  She made great recommendations including a special roll of the day.  Her service was warm, efficient, and friendly.  

We started with the squid app (3.95) - a bowl of seasoned calamari that was not quite to our taste.  Onto the main event... the special roll of the day 3 way reverse cowgirl (15.95) was incredible.  It was balanced, filling, interesting, and really delicious.  We also really loved the ebi ten (5.50).  The sweet potato roll (4.10), rainbow roll (12.50), and 86 roll (10.25) were all fairly standard - but good none the less.  The boy also enjoyed eel nigiri (2.25).  The fish was fresh and beautiful.  The colors were bright, the taste was clean, and the slices of the fish (especially the eel) were thick full slices (we thought it was a great value).

On a whim, we shared mochi for dessert... both the chocolate and green tea were delightful.  The dough was thinner than mochi I've had before - which made it less gummy and really allowed the flavors of the ice cream to come through.

The CN Tower is sorely lacking signs (and sometimes staff) to direct you on where to go. The lines/procedures for visiting the top of the tower vs going to the restaurant are different, so my boyfriend and I found ourselves going back and forth a lot and lining up unnecessarily with the crowds just going to the top. By the time we arrived at the restaurant, we were peeved and slightly late - but even then our table wasn't ready yet. The staff who set the tables and served water were friendly... to my boyfriend only. I felt completely ignored - I'm not just trying to complain, but it was a very discouraging experience. The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful, on the other hand, which was refreshing after such awkward and annoying experiences prior. The views are amazing. The restaurant rotates if the weather is cooperating, and you get great views of the lake and the city. The food was okay - very well presented and nice-looking, but the taste was nothing exceptional. Overall, I think a lot of the slightly more negative aspects of this experience could have been easily remedied. The views are nice, but I'd rather recommend someone to go to the top and eat at the cafe rather than going to the 360 restaurant. The only other plus of going is probably the ride to the top since it's included with the set meal price.",2015-07-13 21:09:03

The restaurant would surely offer some unique choices of salad and soups which I hadn't seen before.  The restaurant would surely have many different kinds of ingredients and maybe some gourmet items as well.  

Not!  Totally disappointed.  Apparently the place I envisioned would need to be called Souper Douper Salad, because the choices at SS were regular everyday buffet items.  For such an extensive bar, you would think the cook could tie a cape on some of those plates and let 'em soar.  

For me, they really needed a more pleasing presentation.  The pictures that other reviewers have uploaded look a lot better than what I remember seeing.  Perhaps I should try another spot - Metrocenter ain't the best place to find quality.

Also, I was turned off by the number of salad choices that were covered in too much dressing, but take that as a side note, 'cos I'm picky.   Anyway, I created my own salad and had a bowl of regular veggie soup.

Didn't bother to re-up for seconds.  Maybe I wasn't hungry enough.

I will say this, it is not the Church Brew that I remember.

The beers are OK- from their usual rotation to whatever sort of seasonal they are churning out. I had the Millenium Trippel, and my girlfriend had the coconut stout. Both were reasonable.

Our appetites were slavering, having just circumnavigated the downtown looking for somewhere to park for the Jazz festival, yet leaving maligned due to the usual parking issues of downtown Pgh during an event. On the way back, we figured we had not been to Church Brew in a long time, so it would be just the ticket. 

They had an insert with southern/ creoleish dishes as the specials. This really got my tastebuds raring to go, as I love spicy southern food. To start, we had the alligator peirogies, and for entrees, the Cubano, and the Pulled Pork.

The peirogies were tasty enough, but I really did not get anything related to an alligator out of that. Hide I been blind, or blindfolded, I would have assumed they were regular peirogies with a bit of chutney on top. 

My girlfriends Cubano was a huge disappointment. This is the second time we have tried to get a Cuban Sammich somewhere and left thinking ""WTF"".  This sandwich is about 1) Well toasted bread 2) A good slathering of mustard 3) an evenly spread layer of crunchy pickle and 4) meat.

In that order. 

My pulled pork was flavorful, but no world beater by any stretch, and was paired with rice and beans minus anything to complement them in terms of flavors. Dont get me wrong, I think those ingredients go together, but some extra spices or textures would have made the dish superb.",2013-06-10 20:23:44

Maybe it's the tornado rolls...maybe it's the mouth watering summer rolls. I DON""T KNOW BUT I WANT TO LIVE IN IT!!!! The restaurant, not the summer roll.

So first of all, since I'm cheap, the prices are great. I have never paid more than $20 for an entree and appetizer here. 

They also have an AYCE menu. When I found this out, I almost jumped out of my pants. Good thing I didn't, I hear no pants no service? Anyway, the AYCE menu is amazing because, surprisingly, they have GOOD sushi with very little rice and a lot of stuff. They have sashimi, for some reason the menu says that you can only order 5 pieces per person but I always order more and that seems to be on with the staff. They have a lot of wok options, the servings aren't that big so you can try everything!!! Don't miss out on AYCE at Spring Rolls!!!! Tornado rolls are those shrimps wrapped in a batter that looks like a tornado. It's hard to describe but trust me, iz gooood. And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones - they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz

The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice. Last time I went we had a n00b, it was his first day, and he was aaaadorable! So nice and so helpful and just a tad shy - everything you want in a server. 

The food is fresh and it comes quick. There are two options for the AYCE menu, you can get the regular or the premium. Premium comes with some delicious options and it's only $3 more - GET IT! Don't be shy.

Location:
Where Eastern and church Street meets and Eastern splits and becomes front! In the basement of the flatiron building. .

Parking:
It's all pay parking in the area. They are all tiny spots too. High chance of having your car door dinged! Just take transit or get a ride. Will also save you stress from having to make sure you don't run over pedestrians. Being in such close proximity to St. Lawrence market there are a lot of walkers. Kids and dogs too!

Getting inside:
It's located into the Flatiron building. In the basement. You have to walk down old warn concrete stairs. It's kinda cool really.

Decor:
I have to admit, it's pretty nice. They've renovated and wow. It used to be dark now it's bright. Even though it's in the basement they have big windows on the north and south side of the building that lets in lots of light. There are booths and tables and booth-table hybrid seating. Comfy and welcoming. 

Food:
Yum! I got the small nachos with spicy beef and my dining companion got the burger with goat cheese, no buns and fries.

I'm so glad I got the small nachos. Man, they were huge. They did them great. The chips stayed crispy and the were covered in a tonne of cheese. The spicy beef was a terrific choice. It added that extra kick that just brought them up to great. The only thing.... The guacamole, salsa, and sour cream were poured over the top. That was no bueno. It actually was really messy, covered the beef and made it a bit hard to eat. It also looked kinda weird and unappetising.

The burger. She loved loved it. Said she'd get it again in a heartbeat. It looked and smelled great too.
She said the fries were perfect.

Staff:
Omg loved the staff. All of them were great. Everyone made sure we were taken care of. Even if the food had been crap (it wasn't) I would be back because everyone was so great

I usually order Kimchi flavoured foods whenever at a Korean Restaurant so I didn't hesitate at all in ordering the Kimchi Soon Tofu. I was very please with Tofu Village's version as the broth contained the right amount of spiciness and it tasted delicious. It went well together with their purple stone pot steamed rice which was visually appetizing as it was yummy. The purple rice that's stuck at the bottom of the stone pot is very good (the waiter/waitress pour water into the stone pot to soften up the rice). It's good after eating a spicy bowl of Soon Tofu as it's refreshing. 
As for banchans, They bring them out as soon as you sit down and they are all very delicious - kimchi, pickled cucumbers, pickled radishes, potatoes etc. They are also very nice about bringing you some more if you ask (the kimchi was sooo good, i had to ask for refills 3 times!).

If you don't want a burger, you can get a chicken breast or hot dog, but it seems almost sacriligous.  

This is a good spot for lunch on weekdays if you work in the area.  It's not as crowded as you might expect given it's location in the middle of a university campus.  And it's amazing how quickly they seem to get food out ( you have to wait in line for your burger ).  Enjoy!",2007-08-07 03:54:30

Four stars means I will go back often and have never been unhappy.   I guess LGO is a 3.5 stars place.. Because I go often, but am sometimes unhappy. First, let me address one thing that most people have an issue with. I live close enough to walk there and back, so parking is never a problem and is not factored into my review at all.
Let's start with the good things, beause there are many.
The coffee is good.  The breakfasts are awesome.  The sandwiches almost never disappoint. The bathroom is always spotless. They have cool stuff like Necco wafers and Black Jack gum for sale.

There are two  things that bring it down a half a star.
1.  The music is  REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, loud!  ALWAYS!!!!
2.Ordering and paying is stressful and chaotic since there are two cash registers, but no ryhme or reason as to which side to go to, and many times I have waited in line only to have someone walk in, bypass the line, and talk to someone over the bakery case, and get served---that can make you feel homicidal and the staff gives off a vibe that doesn't discourage that kind of behavior.
Now, let's get to why it is a possible 4 instead of a possible 5.  It lost a whole star for the following reasons.

1.  The specifically have  a parking spot out front for ""curbside while you wait service"" (also for pick up of called in orders I believe)  you can wait in your car until you die before someone comes out.  You have to go inside and get someone.  Just turn the damned parking spot into a handicapped spot and at least then someone can use it!!!
 
2. the handicapped spots are all the way at the end of the sidewalk to the north, so if someone has a wheelchair or a walker, not only do they have to go a  fair bit, but, and here's the big one, they have to SQUEEZE by the cafe tables and chairs and people, and people with dogs, that are lined up in front. I don't know about you, but I feel like an ignorant pig when I am using one of those front tables and someone needs to get by me, but I had my headphones on, or my head in a book, and they are waiting  helpless.
I hate this!!!!!  To top it all off----
Recently, I just experienced it from the handicapped point while taking my mom there for a cup of tea and a cookie.

It stinks!  If they move the handicapped spots to the spot where they have the USELESS ""curbside service""  I will up this review to 4.5 stars.

If they do that AND lower the music to an enjoyable level, They get 5 stars.

UPDATE: 
I now only go either fairly late in the evening or when dragged by someone else.
I've decided that my money is better spent somewhere more tranquil.  Still deserves 3 stars I guess.",2011-03-28 20:04:43

This Korean-run restaurant is tucked away near business parks and therefore, an occasional hideout for IBMers.  

The agedashi tofu ($4.95) is a great starter and comes with five generous pieces served with shaved daikon, sliced red peppers and fresh green onions; order it without bonito flakes to make it vegan.

The vegetable tempura lunch set ($7.95) comes in a bento box with salad and miso soup (free of  fish stock).  Tempura included mushrooms, broccoli, sweet potatoes, pepper and squash.  Even the tempura batter is outstanding - light and crispy!  They don't skimp out on the rice either; despite rising prices of grains, they still serve the pricier, more glutinous rice.

Camp Social is a popping place and apparently for birthday parties cause that's what was going on upon our arrival.  

My friend and I sat at the bar where the tire swinging chairs was a cool draw and everyone wanted to sit and try it out.  We didn't get a chance but all is well.  The place itself seems very playful with a game room and a ""camper"" room where you literally sat in a camper.  

For our food we ordered the Pretzels, The Camp Fire burger and topping it off with some s'mores.  The pretzel came with a beer cheese, which was much needed since the pretzel was not a pretzel bread which I'd expected to be.  Instead it tasted like bread in a pretzel shape and was very dry.  As for our burger it was cooked to the right temperature and the bun to patty ratio was spot on.  The burger was topped with mozzarella, bacon, Fresno chilies, and a peppered aioli; lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes on the side.  The burger didn't do much for me since I think the bun was a tad bit dry, the bacon was overcooked and if anything the Fresno chilies were the stars.  I did have to add my own ketchup to add moisture.  Finally, the s'mores came a blazing with a fire top as you cook your own marshmallows and create your own sandwich; which was totally fun.  It came with 5 servings and since there was only 2 of us; we decided to share with everyone at the bar; camp socially indeed we did!

In the end, Camp Social is a cool spot for some fun flares and drinks.  Though the food was okay I don't think I would come back to take a bite anytime soon. - Enjoy!",2018-05-22 01:54:00

No reservations are required. I showed up around 5:30 pm and easily got a table for 4 on a very LOUUUUDDDD hockey night (I could not hear myself it was so loud-where this place loses stars). 

The waitress was friendly and was able to upgrade our table when 2 extra people showed up. There was a period of confusion when our waitress said someone else would be serving our table- and nobody ever showed up! Consequently, we literally had to flag down a random waitress after 20 mins waiting  to order food. I don't get how customer services works if clients are waiting to order food - and we have to make the order vs being served.

Aside from this mishap, I really liked the concept of their food menu-being only one page  both sided-simple and clean. You can build your own charcuterie plate from a variety of meats, cheeses, vegetarian options for a fixed price. The oysters were ok better than oysterfest!

There are three seating levels, the balcony above us and a large orchestra below, with a total capacity of about 2000 seats. There is a good slope to the seating, so even with someone tall in front of me, my sight line was not blocked. There are lots of bright paintings on the ceiling, and a lot of red in the décor. The lighting was excellent, and the acoustics were great, never too loud. There is a very nice elevator that we went up in, and then lots of stairs to come back down. (The theatre is fully accessible however.) Apparently, the women's washroom line-up at intermission was very long as expected, but not so for the men's.

I just went back and got their Steak and Blue salad. I'm a bit confused on where the ""Blue"" part comes into play. No Blue Cheese on the salad. The steak that is crumbled onto the salad was yummy. They tossed some sauteed onions and green peppers. That was surprisingly good.  The salad comes with a sweet Vinaigrette, it's to sweet, and really thick. I didn't care for it to much, it's so sweet, it leaves you thirsty ASF.

Steak and Blue...Interestingly enough Blue Cheese isn't even an option for a dressing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

The wait to order kinda sucks, the line was out the door and that was at Noon.
Get there early or get there late, but don't get there when it's noon, you'll spend your lunch break looking at the back of some schmucks head in line ahead of you.

It is said to have been coined in the 1940s and was a reference to a soldier under a disciplinary measure or a convict (restricted to a specific place, the yard), and now it is being used to refer to the humble chicken, as in this particular establishment.

I was doing a day trip to Vegas for a conference and hobbled (stress fracture in my foot, I'm in a boot) from the Mirage over to the Venetian to try their fried chicken. They note, in their menu, the long preparation time for their chicken. I got the blue plate special which is two pieces of chicken, a buttermilk biscuit and their cubed watermelon (I think it was service with mint).

The chicken wing was good, nice and crispy, and quite tender. The other piece, breast meat, was also quite tender but the crust was more of the KFC original recipe versus a thick, crispy, outer coating, which is my preferred format for fried chicken.

As for the biscuit, folks, if you are going to do a buttermilk biscuit, realize that is much of a cultural envoy of Southern Culture as the yardbard. The one i received was square and seemed like it was pulled from a series of connected biscuits. It was a bit dry and felt more like an afterthought and not like the chance it is to impress the true lover of good Southern cooking.

As for the watermelon, it didn't have much flavor at all. it needs a little something to also stand out on the plate.

I did like that all the beers on draft were from local breweries in Nevada and I had a great IPE called a ""dirty dog."" 

Accordingly, I can say, i wasn't unhappy with the meal but all three main food items have an opportunity to be better. As with many things in Vegas, though it is a great city, the hype, at least for me, did not live up to expectations. Though I may come back for the twice fried chicken wings if I'm back in Vegas again. Hope springs eternal in the heart of any lover of Southern cuisine, including my own. :-)",2016-03-23 23:19:44

Moji is not a bad place to hang out.  It's got decent food, not freaking amazing, but not terrible.  Their service is decent, their prices are quite good for the portion sizes you get. 

Highlights:
- Unagi - for $11.99 I get a bowl of Unagi rice with the a very decent sized piece of eel.  There was more eel then rice.   I am impressed since most restaurants tend to skimp.   

- Rose Calpis (Calpis is a Japanese soft drink even though it sounds so similar to something not drinkable but coming from a cow.)   Rose Calpis drink was pretty....nice gradient pink, with little rose petals, and was also quite refreshing.  I wasn't expecting it to be good and it was!  

-Happy hour specials - you get a small bowl of entree, an appetizer and a drink for $5.99.   That's very well priced.   Most people get the cheese takoyaki (keep in mind there's no cheese in the takoyaki, it's on top).   

- Their shrimp tempura was decent, I mean not anything super special, but done right, crispy and hot.  

- The lobster and tobiko with sheets of seaweed is a really tasty appetizer.   

The interior is very pintrest and Instagram happy.   :-)  

Lowlights:  
- Their ice creams are super pretty for photos but taste okay.   I mean, it depends on your taste buds, if you like taro bubble tea (the purple stuff that comes in powder form), you will LOVE their taro soft serve.

Some of the calligraphy is truly amazing.  Most countries of the Islamic world are represented though there seems to be more Persian art than anything else.  The architecture is impressive, as is the outside plaza (not really a garden in the Western sense of the word) with its reflecting pools.

The reason I am only giving it three stars is that despite the excellence of the permanent collection and a large space for changing exhibits, there is just not enough stuff in here to justify a $20 admission (I went on a Wednesday afternoon when it was free - and very crowded, including lots of small children).  On top of this the parking is $3.50 an hour in a not particularly dense neighbourhood.  Given the Aga Khan's wealth, he could have made the museum free and paid for its staff himself, in perpetuity.

Labelling of items was okay, though there could have been a little more context.  I would have especially liked to have seen a bit more on different schools of Q'uranic calligraphy, since there was so much variation in this.  The special exhibits were well done when I was there but did take up the amount of space allotted, giving them a somewhat sparse appearance.

I was really pleased with the flavor, the presentation, the quality and the price.

I'll go back for sure!

I went for my standard, no frills green tea with boba, and the hub went for a mango creation. I admit the mango creation was like a mango in a glass with a shot of sweetness. I actually enjoyed the mango more than the green tea, which is a rare occurrence. As for my green tea, the flavor was on point, but the boba were off. They were a bit too firm and without much of a taste. I am not sure if boba can be stale, but that is how I would describe this batch of boba. I think I must have arrived at the worst possible time, as everything else was delicious. Still, for me, boba are crucial, so I must return to see if the boba were just experiencing an off day.

These same people usually never have anything positive to say about a Canadian smokehouse, simply because it's here in Toronto.

 I personally have experienced deep south BBQ contests and a few in Texas as well where they believe they invented BBQ lol, ultimately there really isn't much difference, the main differences are in the rub and marinades, that's what usually sets them all apart, but really the differences are marginal at best. In my opinion and experience, american meat is generally lower quality than it is here in Canada... regardless if it's here or in the states, If BBQ is done properly, then  they will all be  various levels of delicious. It's pretty difficult to screw up unless you overcook it.  

That being said, my experience with Greenwood Smokehouse was excellent, i ordered the ""Danforth Decker"" and my friend ordered the mac and cheese with their house cured bacon. The danforth decker was a crazy sammy made with rib meat, beef brisket, pulled pork and their house cured bacon along with two generous slices of real cheddar on both sides and served on toasted challah bread, wow!! the portions were huge and the sandwich was incredibly good, it had a deep smoke flavour along with their delicious bbq sauce, it was really quite divine, something i'd definitely order again. 

My friend ordered the Mac and cheese and added their bacon to it, he was amazed at how good the bacon was and just kept mumbling wow after every few bites. he got the fiull sized portion and could barely finish it.  I know some whined about this place using kraft cheese slices and wonderbread, but speaking from experience, they must have been somewhere else or really high.... or both... 

Overall this place served us some very high quality food, prepared/smoked with lots of love and it showed. This is definitely one of the better smokehouses/BBQ joints in the city as well. I'd advise not to listen to the few negatives below, as some people can never be made happy, they will complain about anything... It's BBQ folks, what do you want it to be? this isn't Haute cuisine, this is down home , back yard smoky deliciousness!

It was nearly 7 pm and we had been drinking for a few hours by that point, so food was critical. Some in the group went next door to Slices and the other members of our party went to Munchies. The menu is mainly Greek, but after four hours of drinking, I opted for a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. The fries were salty and delicious...I'm a huge french fry fan (it's my main unhealthy food guilty pleasure) and I would love these fries sober or intoxicated. The grilled cheese was on pita bread which was interesting, but seriously can you really mess up grilled cheese? 

I presume the gentleman working that evening was the owner and he was awesome. Not only did he not care that the other members of our group brought in their pizza from Slices, but when we were leaving he insisted that we leave our trash on the table and told us he would take care of it. He was very nice to our group and seemed like a very genuine owner that cares about customer service. Plus I presume he is use to dealing with drunk people!

I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. EVERY OTHER 5 GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them. 

She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said no, they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interrupted.

Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #1 the customer is always right. And #2 if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!

The Great Dane was still open, he exclaimed. Whatever. I walked into the loneliest looking bar I had ever seen.

Mac and Cheese? Get the idea? I didn't realize this was Wisconsin, cheese, dairyland, etc. Okay, so I am slow sometimes, it was cold. Anyway, I ordered the Mac and Cheese.

Got the Biscotti al burro con panna at the suggestion of the waitress. So they're called butter cookies, and I'm not sure if there was some confusion w the waitress - but I was under the impression that these would be like wet biscoff cookies. I might have (wishful thinkingly) mentioned biscoff instead of biscotti and she didn't want to correct me. But what I thought I was getting was not at all what I got - but what I got seems like what was supposed to come out. So, it was like 3 butter cookie/short bread like squares w whipped cream. Like butter cookies, not much flavor and little sweetness. I was expecting a less dry biscoff/speculous like cookie. Luckily for me, I asked for Nutella to dip it in. And Nutella is sooo good and basically turned the dessert into Nutella w butter cookie dippers. Which wasn't at all worth the calories, but worked ok.

The service has always been great and I wouldn't be surprised if the drinks are excellent but the food doesn't cut it for me. I'm not from Mexico but I want authentic Mexican food not some cheesy gloppy mess covered with guacamole. Or a flaming skewer of shrimp and beef??? I had the Mar y tierra which is apparently one of the house specialties I'm surprised that this is one of the dishes that the server told me was their most popular. The presentation of the flaming skewer is nothing less than cheesy. And then to top it off the shrimp and beef were COLD after all that. Will someone explain the physics of that fiasco to me. The decor is okay and location is in market square which stinks for parking.

I know... I'm talking in run-ons, but that's really how energetic and upbeat the show is. It just keeps going and going and going. I love how they tied the story together from beginning to end.

I've been to the convention center a few times. I've even attended an event as a vendor, helping my Aunt sell Cookie Lee jewelry. The most recent trip was for the Heli-Expo 2013. Husband is a helicopter pilot so we were pretty excited this year's Expo was in Las Vegas! A little work; a little play.

The Center was perfect for an Expo involving these machines. Lots of helicopters were on display and set up for sale inside. No indoor flying was allowed though. 

There are lots of food options (though, they could use a couple more for good measure). The restrooms are large and were clean. It took us a couple of days to walk around and see everything. Yes, a couple of DAYS. 

Parking is $10 and they wrote the date on the parking card our first day there. Luckily we were there the 5th and 6th, so we made the 5 look like a 6 with a small stroke of pen, and parked for free the next day as if we were re-entering. And that is how you save $10 on parking.",2013-06-07 21:44:23

From the moment you walk in to Village Ice Cream, your olfactory system is graciously slapped with the luscious aroma of fresh-griddled waffle cones. 

It is a smell reminiscent of Molly Moon's in Seattle (where I heard that Billy, the owner, trained as part of his preparation in establishing Village ... so that makes logical sense). As we were walking up, the ""industrial"" setting of the business also reminded me of the time Jessica and I visited Franklin Fountain in Philadelphia (an equally reputable bastion of excellent ice cream, albeit with a different approach).

But the best thing about the initial impression of Village, and my associations with these two Colossi of Creameries, is that while these two serve up some of the best frozen dairy on opposite ends of the U.S. coast, THIS ONE is right in my own concrete back yard. And you know what's amazing? It's maybe even better than both of them.

The flavours are fantastic, I needn't say more. But it is the passion that really gets me. It is the way that the Billy's eyes lit-up as he told me I HAVE to try the homemade hot fudge over my Maple Pecan/Salted Caramel combo. It is the way his staff gushed over the deliciousness of the product. These are the things that, for me, pushes an establishment from being ""amazing"" to being ""the best.""

The last thing I will say is that I am so happy that there is an ICE CREAM place this good in Calgary. I love gelato, really, I do, but it is a breath of fresh air to see a high-caliber ice cream place up there with the gelaterias. It is kind of like when somebody decides to do good pizza, but not necessarily Napoletana. 

Now that I've finished writing this review, my biggest struggle for the rest of the day will be to fight off my craving for Village Ice Cream. It is a happy burden.",2013-02-27 20:07:18

It's hard to rate the Aga Khan because some things are done remarkably well, while other design choices leave a lot to be desired. Let's start with the good: the space is absolutely gorgeous with the grounds, the inner garden, and their hanging rug with gold threading. In the summer, be on the lookout for weekly events. Every now and then, there is a live sitar player, which really adds to the ambience. There's a resto on site that seems to be up and running again. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, it's free Wednesday nights.

Now the not-so-good. The permanent exhibition space seems tiny and consists of a narrow breadth of pottery, paintings and the Koran. Even if you took your time, you'd easily see it all in less than an hour. Their exhibition space is even tinier in comparison and you find yourself at the end thinking, ""what, that's it?"". This in the context of a $20 admission fee, $10 flat parking cost, and no super easy way to get here, and you start to wonder ""is it worth it?"".

So when Frankie's closed for a year & transitioned to Darby's, I was skeptical. Their space is teeny-tiny, it's in a sort-of-weird location... How good could it be? But I kept hearing, over & over, that it was outstanding, so I finally gave it a try.

A+, two thumbs up, would go back again on repeat. 

The space is gorgeous, totally revamped from its Frankie's days. It feels very clean & a little bit fancy, & somehow much bigger than before. Their food options are broad, from burgers & wraps to strip steak, scallops, & fried chicken with mac & cheese. I feel like there's something for everyone (& every wallet preference) on their menu. They also offer a few different kinds of sliders, none of them burgers, which is sort of an interesting twist. Their lunch prices are particularly reasonable, & as a dinner spot, Darby's is suitable for a date, a meal with Mom, or catching up with friends - casual or a little bit upscale. 

At night, Darby's transitions from restaurant to bar, with craft beer options & basic beer options alike, in addition to a full bar, that make it a great space for casual weekend nightlife.

Start with options of meat such as Kobe beef, wagyu, ostrich, duck, lamb, turkey, and black bean (some are standard, and some are available only on special).  

Time to add some toppings.  Any cheese of choice...veggies, sauces, whole grains, foie gras, pretty much anything you can think of!  Purchase them one at a time, or get a bunch of different ones to share at the table.  For those of you that have a hard time making decisions, just flip the menu over and select from one of the house favorites (all the ingredients are pre-selected for you).  

Then move onto the sides....my personal favorite - the tator tots (although the sweet potato fries are a close second).  Again with the choices - do you want bbq sauce to dip them in, or ranch?  Chipotle aoli, or pepper sauce?  The list goes on and on!  

Finally - pick a frosty beer or fruity cocktail to enjoy along with your meal, or just sip on the cucumber water brought to the table.  

What I love about Stax is that it is casual, but chic.  The food is delicious, but affordable.  The portions are small, but still shareable.

I've known of Umami for years but just never really gotten around to trying it, so I figured this would be the time.

I started with a pork belly bun, and it was pretty standard in that the pork belly was fatty, the scallions were fresh, and the pickled vegetables were present, too. The bun itself, however, was strangely dried at the edges and wasn't super pillowy like other baos I've had.

Dumplings were yummy; I had the shrimp and pork, and these were something I would consider coming back for. Not too oily, good filling, and crispy.

For my main, I went for the tonkatsu ramen, which I felt was underwhelming compared to the other bowls of ramen I've had in Madison: the broth was too salty, the noodle texture was kind of mushy, and the bamboo was tough to chew. The fermented egg was my winner in this bowl.

It's interesting how 18th and 60th birthdays can be held in the same place while everyone has a total blast. 

People will tell you that you'll end up standing on your chair and singing at the top of your lungs.... don't believe them?   We'll see ;)   Even my shiest and most stick-in-the-mud party attendees eventually gave in and got loose a bit there.   If you're already planning to be up there dancing away, wear fun accessories if you're celebrating because you'll probably get a chance to show off a bit more on stage. 

What my slightly younger self did to win a pitcher of beer is not for discussing here... but I can say you'll have a great time and you might end up a bit outside of your comfort zone.

If you're not planning on tipping with your song requests, you probably won't hear them.  What has disappointed me in the past is putting a song up there with a $10 and not even getting to hear it.  Did it fall off or the money ended up with another song?  I can't imagine the going rate for songs cost over $10....  oh well those musicians deserve that $10 even without getting my song. 

I wouldn't eat here - it's palatable but too expensive for what you get.  Ultimately we end up getting something to absorb alcohol  but it's not a great place for culinary delights.  Alcohol in here is expensive but I like their menu of mixed drinks and martinis and given the entertainment value and still reasonable cover I can forgive the price for a drink.",2013-06-27 18:31:04

I odered a deep fried pork chop Q04, the receipt show the order time 2:41pm, and i wait until 3:15 and asked the staff, where is my food. She return back with an answer said they give it to the wrong table. Ummm ok, so just cancelled it please. In return, they offer a free dessert to us as apology. We ordered an original cheese bread.....the staff served it to the wrong table agin (the table beside us). Anyway, we finally got it. And the cheese bread was really disappointed. Hard, dry and it isnt soft at all. This is not what a cheese bread should taste like!!!!! My best friend used to make this all time time and i know!

I am relatively new to town and haven't established a good place to get my eyebrows done. I called right as my lunch break was starting for work and asked if they could do a walk-in eyebrow. They said come-on over but I will have to wait 15 mins... I ended up waiting 45. One of the lobby girls was nice but one was extremely rude. Then I went into the eyebrow room with a student (who was not supervised which was weird). I assumed since no supervision she must be about to graduate. Waxing my eyebrows took her 15 minutes and when I looked in the mirror they were two different shapes and a chunk  was missing from the right one. I went to pay for them because I already used way more of a lunch break than the hour that I get. Come to find out they charge the same price for eyebrows that places with licensed cosmetologists do. Yikes I had to wait over a month for my eyebrows to fillout and not have a missing chunk.,2014-04-27 00:49:43

The rooms are a good size with all the necessary requirements like a fridge, an iron, and a tv, but also the nice-to-have additives of an in-room mini safe, ipod dock for musical enjoyment, and a super comfy bed for that all important beauty sleep.
The rooms were very clean, and the location is fantastic as it's just around the corner from Union Station, ACC, Skydome, CN Tower, and other downtown tourism sites. 

The biggest complaint I could make is that the elevators are slow, but given its somewhere in the 40 story realm, I suppose that can be expected. Since thats the worst thing I can think of, I suppose 5 stars is called for on this review.

I might not have had I realized we would be the only customers. This place is HUGE, really big with hundreds of seats yet at lunch it was empty. They seemed to have planned for that as it appeared only 2 on staff, a cook, and a manager that served us.

We were  quickly welcomed by that manager that came out to greet us, he was friendly, likable and informative.  We sat outside at a bar and service was swift with plenty of recommendations.

Wings and Pizza it was. The 6 wings seemed like a small order and the wings were just ok, a few were broken. In my book broken wings are thrown away and not served, carrots, celery and ranch with a good buffalo sauce helped make them ok. The 14 inch Fat guy pizza was good but I didn't act on my impulse to omit Chorizo and it was regretted. The chorizo flavor almost overwhelmed  the entire pie. At $19.00 I have had so many better pizza's. 

I have eaten some of the very best pizza in America, pizza is my passion and my conclusion here is that Boss has potential, great cheese and pepperoni, along with a crisp crust was enjoyable, but I also think the space could be better served as a bowling ally.",2018-01-25 00:25:33

But I also found that HOT thinks too highly of itself. I came here with a big group for dinner. I found the entrees to be more expensive than their worth: I ordered the beef tenderloin with spinach and horseradish mashed potatoes, and it was good but it was nothing to merit its $29 price tag. We also ordered apps to share, including a cheese plate, which was just.. cheese. With not enough crackers for the amount of cheese. I got the sticky toffee bread pudding for dessert and it was delicious. I'd highly recommend it. But the night I went, they were out of a lot of things, and this was Friday at 9pm. Their espresso machine was broken, so no coffees. They ran out of ice cream. They ran out of their nightly special.

I had a special from the wood burning oven, brosin stuffed chicken, with risotto, fresh greenbeans and a butternut squash reduction.

The fact that it's in Milano's mega-plaza next to LGO and other great places...it just all works for me. 

The wine is mostly good, although the selections could use a little more of an updating, but the prices are definitely right. Come before 5pm and all glasses of wine are only $5.

Upon arrival we walked and measured the areas to be cleaned noting the dirtier areas but also that there were no stains. The price was recalculated based on the actual measurements and it was $50 less than the quote. It took about two hours to complete the cleaning after which there were some waves in the carpet. I'm used to seeing that after previous cleanings so I wasn't surprised and they said they would smooth as the carpet dried. Of course they were right and after 24 hours of drying the ""waves"" were gone. But it did take 24 hours for the carpet to dry, not the 2-7 hours they quote. I really didn't believe 2-7 hours so I wasn't upset when it took a day. We just replaced the furniture around 30 hours after cleaning was complete and all was well.

I have flown many of times and gone many of places from California, Washington, Nevada, and Texas and have never ran into a rude crew. 

Price of tickets are reasonable, and your 1st & 2nd bag flies free, which has come in handy when a kid or 2 has moved out and left some stuff behind it's easy to just pack it and fly it to them when you visit them. 

Some flights (so far all the ones I have been on) have WIFI, and when I have a long flight or a stop or 2 I have partaking in the all-day WIFI, it worked perfectly too, only you can't stream your Netflix or HBOGO, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Yes, it's pretty busy right now since the grand opening was last week but it's not as busy as I thought it would be. The food here is also really good but my complaint is regarding their IKEA Family ""eat for free"" deal. We noticed their signs throughout the store stating that if you purchase food your cost will be applied to any home furnishing purchase over $100. We thought this was great! Especially considering we spent over $40 on food. Yes, we noticed some dates on the bottom of the flier at the dining tables but we read the fine print and nowhere did it say what those dates represented. We realized that those days fell on weekend days and thought they had to be blackout dates. We re-read the flier and again it didn't say anything. So we went with our first impression. Yep, we get the to the checkout counter and the cashier said she had no idea what we were talking about. First off, an employee should know what kind of promotions their company is running. Well, luckily I took a picture of the flier and showed her and she said quickly ""oh those are for those dates only"". Hmm funny how the flier didn't say ""only on the dates listed below"". I'm sorry maybe it's supposed to just be known but I really didn't get that from the flier itself. They need to work on their advertising.

Overall, if you've got a new home or apartment, this place is a good place to buy your first couch or bedroom set. The couches aren't very comfortable (I know this because my roommate had purchased one in the past) but you get what you pay for. I've mostly only bought home accessories when I've gone to IKEA like a wine rack, bath rugs, vases, etc. The deals for such items are pretty great.

- Their Tapioca was not ready, so they replaced with Lychee Jello (There is nothing on the menu about $0.50 surcharge)

There's a bar inside which provided you with a variety of basic drafts and cocktails.  Compared to a lot of the other studio movie grills they have a lounge area which kind of gives you a club atmosphere.  

The seats were comfortable and you get to choose tour seats before you purchase your ticket which is a plus! My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night to watch Fury and this movie had a lot of action going on but during those quiet scenes you can definitely hear the clubs around the corner since their music was blasting.  I would seriously suggest watching a movie during the day instead of the evening unless you don't mine hearing club music during your theater experience. 

My only reason for a four star besides the walls being thin is because the waitor lost my boyfriend's debit card.  This is like every person's nightmare! I know it's an honest mistake but they really need to be more careful.  We were understanding and were upset but the manager and the crew working took full responsibility.  For them to continue looking and taking action to make sure they didn't misplace it meant a lot to us.  They continued to look in every station and up and down all the rows in our movie theater which gave us a little peace of mind that they did care about our service.

The Desserts:

The Drinks:
The drinks are amazing from their alcoholic beverages to their coffees/lattes and specialty hot chocolates.

You should definitely try the Nutella Hot Chocolate!  It is scrumptious.  They also have soy milk for any lactose free clientele.

Came here around noon with the fiance after a gym workout. This is a new location, and was packed. Similar to places like Q'doba and Chipotle, you start at one end and work your way down the assembly line. The first lady (with a glazed over look) ""greeted"" us with ""for here or to-go"".

I am not the biggest fan of chains, but I did like how nothing was over cooked or seasoned. Sometimes the amount of sodium used in fried foods are overwhelming. The calamari were cooked to a nice light brown and had a good crunch while maintaining tender texture. The batter was flavorful with the speckles of pepper being visible throughout. Not only do you get a good amount of squid but they batter and fry up some banana peppers as well. The nice bites of pickled spiciness was a welcoming palate cleanser. The spinach artichoke dip was decadent and rich. It comes with the same flat bread you get once you sit down. The bisteca salad was a huge wedge that comes with a creamy dressing. Tossing some balsamic with it made it better. We also got a chopped salad that had a red wine vinaigrette that was not very bold.

The wild life here is insane, though it's mostly birds with some turtles and bunny rabbits too. So many people appear to come here for the birds, and I can see why. This part is incredibly scenic and worth the drive out. 

The only complaint I had to whole visit was parking, there isn't much and it's super tight! They really do need to expand parking, because this park is huge and amazing, so I see why it's so popular.",2018-01-04 22:41:22

We haven't had a dinner with the family either for the BFs birthday. My birthday dinner here was wonderful that we've been looking to come back. 

Got Arancini Tartufo for appetizers because those are ultra noms.

Mom and Gma had the same thing as last time- the porcini rubbed ribeye, mac n cheese and green bean sides. It was a little too red for mom in law so they had to refire it. We are barely convincing her that at a minimum to get it medium (pink) and not well done so a bit of red gets her bothered still. After the refire she was fine. Grandma didn't care if hers was a bit more red and enjoyed it.

I grabbed Pappardelle Mimmo (Long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, truffle) $39 this time around. It was pretty good, a bit rich. The scallops and lobster was cooked perfectly and pretty generous. What I liked is that they had slice truffle on it and not truffle oil. 

BF got Costolette d'Agnello (Double cut premium, Colorado lamb chops served with Sicilian caponata) $39. The lamb was quality but the BF felt it was under seasoned. There are like 5 items the BF has been dedicated to learn to cook perfectly and one is pan seared lamb (chops and racks) so he isn't a kind judge on no seasoning. It was the first thing he ever learned about cooking was how to season. If you put the caponata with a bite of lamb then it does give it flavor but the BF did not like the caponata so he ate some of mom and grandmas green beans and mac with it. 

I got a beer this time since last I saw they had some rare and interesting beers that are not distributed to stores. I grabbed Bière Du Boucanier Red ($8 for a bottle) which was a lovely Belgian Pale Ale that was a bit hops from the red pale ale style, a bit the familiar Belgian taste, and was a dry champagne like finish with a bit of sweet. I know there are a bunch of lovely wines, but you know what? I'm in a beer phase and don't fucking care. Craft beer can be high end and refined and it perfectly paired with my dish. 

We got some desserts this time around.

White Chocolate Navan Creme Brulee w/raspberries ($7.50). I love creme brulee and this was cooked perfectly. Most places just do vanilla bean brulee so the slight change of flavor was nice. 

Poached Pears w/ grapes and vin santo wine sauce and ice cream ($7.50). Nice, light dessert. I wouldnt think cooked grapes would be good, but I like them. 

Our server was decent. Nice and kinda funny in a cheesy way. 

I loved my birthday dinner, but this one had a few hitches with the food so I can only give this experience 4 stars. I still think it's a good spot though so a future late night Happy Hour will be the next visit.",2010-12-19 10:26:06

Upon walking in the hostess draws a wax paper table cover from a giant spool of paper and walks us to our table and lays it down. That right there tells me we are in for a tasty mess of a meal! That is fun and in reviewing the menu I soon learn just how messy it could get!

We each decided on getting 1 pound of shrimp each with the whole sha-bang sauce  which is all three flavors, rajun Cajun, lemon pepper and garlic sauce! It was great and spicy as well on the complete shrimp that you clean the heads and tail away from. I was not sure if I would like the experience of cleaning the shrimp myself however it was different and not as bad as I had imagined.

We also ordered fried calamari rings and seasoned fries which were simply delicious!

I added on a side of corn and potatoes to my bag and wow that was the sweetest cob of corn I have sucked off in my life! That corn was amazing sweet and juicy, I will be adding that on again in future trips!

This was a fun and messy dining experience and I was laughing at my Fiance stating that I am glad we know each other and this is not a first date! (lol)

After a stellar Elite event, I came back with my friend and treated both of us to lunch today.  I wasn't going to risk waiting forever for table & service (for someone who is chained to a desk, this was a great escape so I wasn't going to push my luck), so I decided to get here right after they open for lunch at 11:30.  Apparently 3 other tables thought the same as well, but the dining room was otherwise nice and empty.  

I like the decor: modern, clean, yet warm.  I couldn't see the rest of the dining area, the space must be bigger than it looks.  My friend and I particularly enjoyed the paper table cover, completed with color pencils and pencil sharpener.  After 1 unfruitful game of tac-tat-toe, we just went to town with writing/doodling on it.  

Service was ok.  Server was nice, but went MIA on me when it mattered the most: at the end.  TIme is of the essence when it comes to lunch shift; it would have been better if he would have brought the check out early and ready to rock & roll.  

Food was great.  We went with the lunch specials.  I picked the meatloaf and substituted mac & cheese for the bleu cheese potato chips.  I also picked the soup of the day (squash soup).  My friend got the house salad (after taking out tomato and onion, it was literally a bowl of lettace) and the BBQ pork quesadilla.  The portion looks small, but it is enough to fill a stomach.  My Mac & Cheese was delicious: great cheese sauce, the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too mushy, not too hard.  My meatloaf was more like chunk of shortrib with mushrooms and wrapped with bacon.  The sauce was flavorful.  Her quesadilla was nothing in comparison in my opinion, but it was actually still good.

Then we got the mussels in the Lobster sauce and braised short ribs.  Mussels were yummy and definitely be my choice if we came back.  The braised short ribs were a little disappointing.  It was cooked pretty well, tender and moist, but I didn't think the flavor was that good.

Arrived with a group of five on a saturday night and they were able to accommodate us by putting a couple tables together. We each ordered our own main, plus a couple extra little dishes for sharing. As I was craving a big bowl of udon, their curry beef udon was a big hit with me - squishy and soupy, with a broth that wasn't over powering at all. It would have been nice to have a little more beef however. The noodles were perfect. I had also ordered the takoyaki and was told that it takes 20 minutes to prepare, but we had some extra time so went ahead with the order anyways. Either the order was misplaced, or sometime had gone wrong, after twenty minutes the waitress came back and apologized and said it would be at least another ten minutes - but we were going to see a movie and couldn't wait the extra time.

The rest of my party was happy with their meals, although I did hear some quiet grumblings about 'needing more flavour', or that 'the yaki onigiri wasn't what we were expecting'. A friend straight out said the Chanwanmushi wasn't great. But when it came down to it, we all had a hearty meal, left with full stomachs, and my entire bill was $7.",2015-03-23 16:40:30
LaVWqh0xRkHNpHHLcw4I7A,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ,odVKlMYqb4FHJXManv-VRA,5,1,3,1,"The funny thing about Yelp's rating scale is that I'm never quite sure whether I'm ranking it against my own personal experience, the options in the area, my lofty ideals for restaurants, etc. I know that's what makes reviews fun to read, but I also know that makes them subjective to some degree. Well, all that intro inside, I think that grabbagreen deserves 5 stars for the following (hopefully) persuasive and somewhat objective reasons: 

-There is nothing like it in the vast office park wasteland otherwise known as the Scottsdale Airpark area. Between Pei Wei, Wildflower and tons of other predictable options, there's not much to choose from for something simple, healthy and non-chainy. This is especially the case since the Whole Foods in the area closed. 
-If you live in the Silverlake area of LA or Seattle, places like this are a dime or dozen, but there are very few places in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area where you can get a good juice, smoothie or healthy breakfast/lunch and I think it earns major points for that. 
-The ingredient list for the drink and food options is comprehensive in my opinion. Avocado or squash in your smoothie, pomegranate or hemp in your brown rice bowl? Yes, please!

I know it's expensive and it's also got a douchey factor but then again, doesn't everything before it becomes a mainstay of an area? At that point, I think it just becomes hipster - or at least, run-of-the-mill/expected :)",2013-11-22 01:59:05

Nate recommends the Tucson (can be known as a Sonoran dog), and being that I lived there for years, that was my choice for a steamie weenie! I miss the Sonoran dogs from Tucson and this one was ok but was missing that key Southwestern flavor! The mustard was a bit much and I barely tasted the lime salsa. Perhaps a spicy red salsa would be much better. It had plenty of beans. 

The loaded potato tots were better than the dog, for me, and they were a pile of greasy goodness! The tots have lots of bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream and all the flavor! I hope the other 3 kinds of tots on the menu are this good! You can make a meal out of this dish for sure.",2015-12-11 18:53:10

I like the Bellwoods Brewery and I love the garage-cum-brewpub venue - it's super rad with a huge patio. While it's not uncommon to see their beers offered on taps at various establishments in town, their brewpub (obviously) has the largest on-site selection, many which are brewed there. 

From your IPAs, to saisons, to trappists  and to ciders, you're guaranteed to find something you like. They also frequently rotate new kinds of beers in, and one of my recent favourites is the BELLWOODS HELLWOODS - a creamy smooth Russian imperial stout that clocks in at 10% ABV! 

My only issue here is that, while the idea of having your food freshly grilled is great, their actual food is really quite subpar in taste, portion size and price. I've tried a bunch of items but the most striking case is their HOUSE MADE SAUSAGE, which is, quite possibly, the blandest sausage ever. I'm not even sure how you manage to mess this up and REMOVE flavour from fat and pork and more fat! My advice, stick to the liquid diet and you'll be just fine.",2012-11-16 18:14:49

Senor Frogs fit the bill pretty well. Although we came just as a torrential downpour occurred, which pushed us from the patio, to the bar to finish eating, the food and service were quite good and the prices reasonable (for Vegas standards). BUT, while we were there there was some sort of singer/karaoke going on. I'm thinking a mixture of the two because we heard one girls' voice for several songs, but every once and awhile some obviously amateur's voice would ring out ""I'm too Sexy"" or a Spice Girl song.
Problems: First of all, I did NOT sign up for karaoke. We sat AWAY from all of that to avoid it, but the problem was that they have speakers over all the tables, regardless of where you are and they were LOUD! Secondly, the woman singing, who, from what we could gauge over the speakers, worked here, was NOT a good singer. It was like listening to one of those American Idol auditions, where the person thinks they're great, but just sort of yells the song out and no one can be bothered to tell them they suck, because they're not nails on a chalkboard, but they're still not good either.
Sadly, we had to listen to this, even though we were in a totally different room!

This is just DARN GOOD food. I got the potato teasers and those things are addictive. They're crunchy on the outside, cheesy and gooey on the inside, and have a very slight heat to them from the jalapeno. They are truly the stuff of dreams. If I ever were forced to chose a last snack, potato teasers would be it.

I also got a double cheeseburger with everything. When I first saw the burger I was admittedly underwhelmed... how could something so small and plain looking be as delicious as everyone claims? Taking one bite took all of those feelings away. The burger was everything you want in a burger. The bun was slightly sweet and perfectly toasted. The onions were crisp and not overwhelming. The cheese was gooey and delicious and the meat was amazing - thin patties cooked to perfection. The combination was just perfect and was all under $8. I'm currently kicking myself in the butt for waiting until now to try out Swenson's.",2017-05-03 17:29:15

Originally we came here around midnight Fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11PM. They offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). No biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at Marquee's dayclub...Spoiler alert: We also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was SOOO GOOD!!

The decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the Cosmopolitan. Our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. 

Bamboozled Shakes:
Drunken Monkey - I added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! The description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. It was like a cookies n cream reese's coconut shake. This was my fav out of all the other shakes. 

Tiramisu - They had me at mascarpone ice cream. I LOVE mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. This tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. 

Banana Creme Pie -  I would say this was my 2nd fav shake. It tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. I liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.

The shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. I like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) I also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!

Apps:
Surf 'n Turf Quesadilla - DELISH my favorite app! This ain't no taco bell quesadilla. It was crunchy and not oily at all. The lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. MUST ORDER!!

Soft Shell Crab Bruschetta - For a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. The softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing

Crispy Calamari - big enough portion to share, I couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. I like that they don't overbread the calamari rings

Maine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. 

Crispy pork belly bun - Tasted better than the ones at Ramsay's BurGR. The steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on

Burgers:
Rising Sun w/ onion rings(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - THE BEST BURGER EVER!! Most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. It didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. Everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. THIS IS what a burger should taste like! The whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. I am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. The tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. You could taste each item in the burger and they all blended well together. The KOBE beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. Onion rings were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! They were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BUTTERMILK RANCH TO DIP THE ONION RINGS IN!! It tastes so divine

Fun-Ghi on WHEAT BUN w/ salad ($2 extra) - Healthy combo huh? My 2nd fav burger, but my friend preferred this over Rising sun because she prefers the truffle flavor. Again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. I actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. The burger wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! The gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. Salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). The only negative is that we added a fried egg to the burger, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(

Gold Standard w/ sweet potato fries- Everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to Rising Sun. Sweet potato fries were bomb!

I would have to say that Holstein's outranks Ramsay's BurGR. We were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. We were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. The food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. Don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!

Pork Chops in Mandarin Sauce- its pretty standard. I haven't had these bad anywhere and I only order in rare moods.

Hong Kong Style Chow Fun- good. It's simple in that its just stir fried in soy sauce, has onions, green onions and sprouts.

I came her on a lazy Friday night after work...it was one of those nights where I didn't really want to go out to dinner, but I didn't really want to stay home...when I first walked in it took me a sec to figure out their set up, and how it works, so I just followed the crowd... (Btw, Don't let the exterior look of this place scare you away-it can look a bit ""outdated/older"")

Once inside, You walk up to a counter, place your order/pay and then wait off to side until they call your name. You can place your order to go, or you can look for a an open table.

I saw that there was two open seats at the bar so I told the young lady that I would be by the bar. I was waiting to here my name be called...but she brought the food on over to me, which was extremely nice of her since she didn't have to do that. 

One of the reasons I decided to actually stay and eat there was that all there draft beer is $3.50 on Fridays. You CANT beat that. They have an AWESOME selection of beers...I just had to stay lol...

We ordered:
Chicken and black bean combo con queso - rice topped with chicken,
black beans and queso. It was delicious! The chicken was pulled right off of the bird, it was hot, tender. juicy....really really good.

1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner with sidesd. Again, the chicken was just PERFECT!

For sides we had white beans au gratin 3/5, squash casserole 5/5, smoked cheese and past salad 5/5, and the collard collard greens 4/5.

First of all, Pickle Barrel has a huge menu. You can pretty much guarantee that everyone can find something they like on a menu this big. The restaurant doesn't really do anything particularly well, but even picky eaters will find something to eat.

That being said, I would avoid this place like the plague in future and I suggest you do as well.

We all ordered appetizers or lunch items, a few salads, sliders and a sandwich, nothing too difficult but it took our food forever to come out from the kitchen. Not to mention that we watched it sit waiting to be transferred to the table for a solid 10 minutes. Our server was nice but really incompetent. My coworker asked if they  had chicken sliders still and even though they weren't on the menu, the server said they could still be ordered (note: they can't be in future, we were told so as we paid). Perhaps this is what took so long but I'm still not sure. The main take away here was that we waited for our food FOREVER. We ate in about 20 minutes and were in the restaurant for well over an hour and a half. 

Nothing was special about the food - my sandwich was ok but really didn't do it for me. Bland and boring even though it was a turkey avocado club, flavors that usually sing together - not here. And the fries I had weren't done well - how do you screw up fries?? My coworker got the cobb salad and asked for light dressing, they didn't even bother to put dressing on it. She asked me to taste some of her avocado and it wasn't ripe so it tasted funny. My other coworker got a small caesar and it was drowning in dressing and my coworker who got the sliders said they were overcooked (and looked it) - and she also paid $16 for THREE sliders. Awful awful awful! Did I say awful?

Besides the horrible service, the manager (one of them) was clearing another table and we were complaining about the service. Rather than come to the table, he quickly retreated away from us and we never saw him again. Great job with the customer service. I'm really bitter about my visit here, I paid almost $20 for a meal that took forever, wasn't that great and for horrible service. 

Overall, a wretched experience at Pickle Barrel - historically I haven't had awful service but it has taken a long time and this visit just sealed the fate for Pickle Barrel. It was lunchtime and it wasn't that busy - what was your kitchen doing that made our food take an hour? As I said, avoid this place like the plague. There are way better places to eat in this vicinity and you won't be disappointed with any of them. I suppose the two-star rating here is indicative of how crappy this restaurant is. I can only hope that they close soon and something better moves in. Poor service, boring food and insane wait times for a weekday lunch crowd.",2012-08-29 18:10:50

I was craving for some souffle and I ended coming here and doing their tasting menu instead...and still did the souffle for my second dessert.

But doing the tasting menu made me an instant fan and my favorite was the mushroom ravioli. I will be back and do that as my entree. The sauce was phenomenal, rich, creamy and divine.

And the dessert that came with the tasting menu was unforgettable. But if you have more room after doing several small courses, I would recommend the chocolate souffle. I'm not really a chocolate souffle guy, but they make the most fluffiest souffles I've ever had which made me a new fan on the chocolate souffle. 

Service was awesome. I appreciated how they entertained me, a single diner with their kindness and hospitality. I'll be back for the mushroom ravioli and souffle.",2016-06-06 07:37:02
AupH08N8BTTVELfBi7a15g,8Ni1MmORWyvW0lJHJiqiQg,1DtyA7pnc66hTkv64lKlzw,5,5,0,1,"Takht-e Tavoos was my first foray into Persian cuisine. I've become a fan ever since! 

With that said, Tavoos' focus is on Persian breakfast including eggs, salads and stews. For those looking for Persian dinner fare, including rice and kabobs, I would suggest looking at their sister restaurants Sheherzade and Pomegranate. 

Tavoos is a cute little restaurant located at College and Dufferin in the Brockton Village area. The interior is nicely decorated with ceramic vases, paintings and ceramic tile giving the restaurant an intimate feel.

The Kashk-e Badenjaan is a must try. It's a sauteed eggplant dish mixed with mint, whey and caramelized onion. Think baba ganoush on steroids. It might be my favorite dip ever and Tavoos does it great. For $7.95, it's a good sized dish and a great appetizer. 

We also ordered the Maast o Khiar which is a yogurt dish consisting of cucumbers, walnuts, raisins, mint and rose petals. It's a cool, palate-cleansing dish that is refreshing on a hot day, You must be a fan of yogurt to enjoy the dish though, but it does go nicely with the Barbari bread. 

Finally for our main, we shared the Dizi Sangi which was a lamb stew cooked with chickpeas, white beans, potato, onion and tomatoes. This is the a truly unique dish consisting of two parts: strained broth and stew. The interesting part is that the dish comes with a mortar
and pestle used to puree the stew so that it can be served on the flatbread. It's actually a lot of work to eat the dish, but it's worthwhile, as the product is complex and flavorful. It's also kind of fun and makes the meal experience more memorable. 

Overall, Tavoos is an excellent Persian restaurant with some unique menu items I have never seen before. This speaks volumes about its authenticity. I also like how they focus on Persian breakfast foods in particular. I am definitely planning to return for another meal.",2015-07-22 16:43:44

My hubby took me to Toronto for a short 1 night trip for my birthday in early November. It was kind of a last spur of the moment travel plan since we didn't know he'd end work so quickly that Friday, but we had a great time! Anyway, we stayed at Delta Toronto near Harbourfront to celebrate my birthday and I loved it! It's highly recommended if you're in the area.

The hotel is relatively new; it only opened late last year in 2014! Because it was so new, everything was quite up to date and I really loved the modern glass building.

We checked in late on Friday evening and we were greeted by a friendly Front Desk staff who helped us to all our needs. We were given a room on the 36th floor with a nice view of the CN Tower.

There are two sets of elevators, six in total that take you up to your room. The elevators are divided into two; three of them take you up for the first half of the building, and the other three take you up to the higher floors. Floor 36 required the higher floor-elevator. All of them had access to common areas such as the swimming pool, fitness centre, rooftop lounge and more.

Our room was great! The bed was really comfortable and warm. The room itself was very modern and chic while it had classic elements throughout keeping the room simple. I liked how our lounge chair was by the window - with a great view like that in our room, I would've loved to enjoy some room service or get some work done while being comfortable. There were more than enough lamps which I really appreciated because I don't like it when a room isn't well lit.

Our desk was very spacious and well made to get some serious work done! The only thing that was disappointing was the old Apple charging cord - we would've loved it even more if it had the most recent charging cable.

Towards the hallway of our room was a mini fridge and your basic hotel amenities including a coffee maker and an electric kettle. I tried to use the kettle to boil some hot water, but it kept making the water very murky (like milk) when I poured some in so I decided to not boil anything.

I really loved the spacious bathroom, though it didn't have a bathtub. I personally don't mind when there is no bathtub as it doesn't take up as much room (and probably more cost effective for the hotel) but my hubby is a big bath taker  so it would've benefitted him if we had one. Overall the bathroom was very clean and it was one of the best I've been in awhile in Toronto.

The view from our room was incredible! On a bright sunny day like we had, you could see really far out. Though it's really a lake, you could probably fool and tell me saying that it's actually the ocean. It really looks like the ocean in my opinion, except that it doesn't have that sea smell of course!

Delta Toronto Hotel has really nice conference rooms plus direct access to Toronto's Conference Centre. Really nice for those cold winter days that we're heading for! We didn't get to enjoy the hotel restaurant nor the rooftop Club Lounge this time round as we checked out early but next time.

The Fitness Centre and Swimming Pool was on the 4th floor of the hotel and it was being enjoyed by many hotel guests. I couldn't enter the swimming pool as I didn't have proper gear on, but through the windows I could see that the pool was well kept, quite big and really great if you have kids.

If you like exercising during your travels, you'd probably enjoy breaking a sweat while you view the CN Tower. I found the fitness centre smaller than I had expected it to be, but it still had everything you needed for a great workout. It's open 24 hours so if you're a night owl like me, you probably have no excuse not to exercise... 

Overall, our short stay at Delta Toronto Hotel was really great. The hotel itself is in a really beautiful area of Toronto, just by the water with lots to do! If you're here with family, not only is there the CN Tower, but the new Aquarium is just nearby and a Blue Jays game is just footsteps away. Business doers will find the Financial District very close, a few blocks up, and literally steps away from the Convention Centre. Hubby and I really enjoyed the newly built 4-star hotel and will definitely come back when we get a chance!",2016-04-28 07:40:23
VAe32rXw6q2gpjnJxjSCag,V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ,IJx1rrQPU5vNxCgV3f4MYA,4,6,0,3,"This visit here was very different from my last visit. The Chefs have changed and I'm here for Restaurant Week. Instead of a menu with many selections we only saw a Restaurant Week Menu that differed not completely but somewhat from the one posted on the Web. I do NOTE that on the Website they do post, ""Menu is subject to availability as we source all of our ingredients from very small producers."" 

What I liked about the menu here for restaurant week is that they offer three courses of a starter, a salad and an entree so I thought that seemed very good since it's a waste of calories ordering dessert UNLESS of course it's an outstanding dessert.

They started us off with an amuse bouche of very creamy but also very velvety cream of cauliflower soup. My very rich little soup had crispy heirloom roasted cauliflower in it as croutons and was a nice surprise, also topped with a cheesy crostini.

My starter was the Hand Rolled Ricotta Gnocchi, they were very light in texture and were well seasoned with herbs,  seasoning and then were lightly crisped. The gnocchi mingled with with lots of tiny sweet local sun gold tomatoes and different sauces adorned the plate.

My husband enjoyed a well crafted Wagu Beef Bone Marrow duo. One was adorned with lamb bacon and the other with a sort of onion jam.

As delicious as the the heirloom sun gold tomatoes were in my starter dish I had very similar tomatoes again in my tomato salad. They were delicious again and a few other tomatoes joined the tomato party. Fortunately I do love tomatoes, especially this quality tomatoes and can eat them all the time. I was looking forward to the jalapeño fritter that was on the web menu but tonights version was crispy seasoned croutons. I enjoyed the tomatoes but the croutons were a little too crisp for me as my fork wasn't able to penetrate the sturdy little cubes. Instead of some kind of cheese curd they made house made ricotta and I think that was a win!

Instead of the Black Grouper with those black tiny lentils that I was looking forward too  I had the halibut since that was what was offered instead. I do have to say the halibut was excellent and prepared to perfection, it was tasty and delicious but it was a very tiny piece as small or smaller weight watchers lunch portion being between two and three ounces. (I'm thinking two) The vegetables on the side were also a very small portion but also excellent and I even enjoyed the sauces, one was lemongrass scented and the other was a tasty pea nage. For my taste I thought the chef was overly creative with the forbidden rice as it had flavors going on with it that weren't savory and seemed odd with everything else going on. I asked my husband to try it and he didn't care for it either but I note other people might like it. So I can't say it was bad I just didn't care for it.

The service was very personal and right on until dinner with only the owner and his helper serving us. Then every seat was filled and they weren't able to check on us and when we were done the helper instead of trying to sell us dessert says something like are you interested in dessert? with what I thought was a stressed look on her face. 

The food overall was very good. This is a very TINY place with 5-7 tables (depending on how they are pushed together) You DO need a reservation for here. This is a B.Y.O.B. a $10. cork fee is applied.",2013-09-22 13:29:10

Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30 PM. No reservations needed. 

Pork bone soup: really really concentrated. I'm not sure if it was because we came pretty late, but it was very salty and thick. It tasted like someone took an excellent pork bone soup, and then dumped in a half cup of spicy ketchup. The pork was really really tender though. 

Pollock stew: came in a massive bowl with just two pieces of fish. Felt like it was very soupy with not enough veggies or fish inside. Very strong flavour that developed into the broth, which was quite good. The fish itself was not very tender though, the veggies were just average. Could probably make something similar at home. 

FYI for side dishes refill: you can only get two of them at once. Most other places let you get all of them.

Would we return? Definitely not - many better Korean restaurants nearby.

TL;DR: salty, average food with juicy pork bones",2018-08-19 04:12:30

The good (very good)....
* Ambience is outstanding.   We sat outside since it was an unseasonably cool day for April in Scottsdale.   Both the patio and the inside are beautiful and relaxing.
* Love the cold pitchers of beer.   The pints of beer are expensive, but the pitchers are really reasonable.  And it was nice to have our server offer fresh, cold glasses in between orders.
* The entrees were very good.   We had a blackened fish sandwich, an order of ribs, and an order of tuna poke.
* The chocolate toffee brownie was too die for.
* Our server could not have been more knowledgeable about the menu, she was very pleasant and extremely attentive.  And she never made us feel rushed, even though we spent almost 3 hours on the patio.

The reasons I cannot give a 5:
* A little pricy for what you get with regard to anything by the glass.   The food seemed maybe just a couple dollars high for most items on the menu.   
* No brunch on Sundays?   Most restaurants we go to have a brunch and all day happy hour on Sundays.   Our bill was almost $200 for 4 people.  That is tough to justify for a lunch.

I came here a few weeks ago with my hubby while waiting for my car to get serviced at JL. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and helped by a very friendly and professional waiter. 

I had tea and a salmon dish with quinoa and a touch of cranberry and veggies which was super tasty and cooked just the way I had requested. My hubby ordered a green juice and turkey meatball pizza which he liked very much and I also thought was very tasty. 

Our total bill came out to be $49 and cents but not including tip which I thought was a little bit over the top for the amount of food we were getting but was glad I tried it. The steep price tag won't deter me from coming back and I'm looking forward to trying some other things on the yummy menu that might be a little wallet friendly.

Overall the service was fast and friendly and the food was delish but I'd say that the average lunch will definitely set you back about $40 + and if you think that's worth it then I'd say go for it but if your looking for a cheap meal then this might not be the place for some peeps.

I had the smoked chicken and grilled andouille gumbo with rice.  It was tasty, not too spicy, and more of a soup or chili consistency than a chunkier jumbalaya type consistency.  I admit I had to save the giant sausage on top of it for leftovers, and felt it was overkill and a bit one-note.  There was definitely NOT enough rice for me, but that's probably because of my Hawaiian background which requires copious rice with chili and soup.  I'd want at least double the portion of rice, and maybe half the amount of gumbo, with a piece of fried chicken or something to go along with it (blame the background again for wanting a ""mixed plate"").  Next time I would order the ""small plate"" size of this (and probably still want extra rice).

I had to ask for water, and it was quite awhile before we got our check.  But otherwise, it was a good experience.  Again, the service is a minor complaint.

Shuseki the red-walled restaurant... Okay, I can't carry on the Rudolph parody; it's straining my brain and my corny-bone. 

We ventured over to Shuseki last night because we were ready to give the underdog a fightin' chance, and I must say that if the place were a little cuter and a bit less fluorescent-lit, it would be giving Ichiza a run for its Japanese small-plate money. The interior is simply not the most comfortable. I have been trying to figure out what it reminds me of, but the best I can come up with is that it looks like Frank from Trading Spaces did a rework. Frank is a nice man, but he himself describes his style as ""eclectic country,"" and that can never be good. So, imagine that Frank showed up and built some Longhorn looking booth structures, painted the walls red, and then hot-glued some bamboo sticks here and there: that is a pretty good visual.

The menu is extensive with lots of small plates, grilled fish, noodle dishes, tempura, sushi and soups (and I am probably missing something). We both had soup: a spicy pork ramen and a veggie tempura udon. The spicy ramen broth was flavorful without inching into being salty. The udon soup flavor was also delicious; however, the tempura upset me because it was julienned vegetables. That's right: little thin slices of tempura vegetables put on top. Perhaps it is more traditional, but I had never seen that. It was a little frustrating because the pieces were hard to fish out despite my very respectable chopstick skills, and before I could fish them out, all of their tempura breading had sogged up and fallen into the broth. This scenario made the broth a little greasy. When I did catch one, it tasted great, but I would really liked to have had some nice full pieces of tempura. 

Still, the overall dish sure beat some other offerings I have had around town, and I am eager to try some of their small plates. So, on one foggy Sin City night, I'll definitely say: Shuseki with your menu so bright, won't you feed my belly tonight.",2010-04-01 16:19:25

Chocolate tart was $7, croissants $4.25 and our ice cream sandwich and frozen macaron came to just under $12. The ice cream sandwich was 2 chocolate chip cookies with Madagascar vanilla gelato.

I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. 

All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as ""Cinnamon Toast Crunch"", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. 

To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.",2009-12-02 19:29:35

Ok. I would definitely say do not come on a holiday. We came here for Father's Day. I made reservations a good week in advance knowing that it would be busy. We were seated 10 min after our reservation time which was 11:30. Our server did take our drink order fairly quickly about 10 min after we were seated and took our food orders about 20 min after that. I knew it would be busy so I expected to have some kind of wait. We were seated right next to the kitchen and so I could see what was happening. We finally got our food around 1 pm but the part about it that bothered me was that I could see my kids pizza sitting underneath the light for a good 20-30 min. In my opinion, I feel that they should have served that pizza right away since they know it's for a kid. So we finally got our food and it seemed like everyone enjoyed their food minus my kids because the pizza was rock hard. I made a comment to the server about it but he didn't respond. Ok, it's whatever at this point. I think there should be a better system when it's a holiday or just in general. Food shouldn't be sitting underneath that hot lamp for the long anyways! Overall, service was lacking (I was trying to find my server a few times to ask about the pizza and to get refills) but we only saw him twice after he gave us our entrees.

I am not sure if the selection is as vast as some of the other Asian supermarkets, but they do carry a great stock of Korean and a good stock of Japanese specialties.

The produce section screams with fresh, vibrant colors. The meats look juicy. Plus, they have a convenient selection of Korean treats. They had little fried fish and ready-to-eat sashimi bowls that looked promising. Looking for banchan? (I know I always am!)

It has proven to be a great decision, because there is almost always something that's fun for us to go see to kill an afternoon.  There's usually an exhibit worth peeking at, or a new IMAX movie.

The static part of the museum is really nothing major.  It's fun the first time around, but then once you've seen it all, there's not much to go back for besides the play room and the dancing magnets (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p_AijTtlc  which by the way have totally hijacked that song at the start, in my mind.  It cracks me up and I could watch it for ages). 

Today we saw the Titanic and Dinosaur exhibits.  The Titanic was really pretty interesting.  Tons of actual artifacts and recreations of various rooms.  The weirdest thing to me though was the recreation of an iceberg.  Anyone here not know what ice looks like?  Anyway, it was fun and something pretty neat to see.  And did you know that all the items that are down there have actually had their chemical makeup changed by the pressure and lack of oxygen down there?  And that they'll fall apart or even explode if simply brought up to surface?  Well I didn't, so I consider the afternoon a success, having learned something new.

Two of the more interesting bits of the exhibit:  the ""boarding passes"" that we were given with names of real passengers (of course I was in first class).  At the end of the exhibit, there is a wall with the names of all passengers and whether or not the survived.  My son survived, the traveling companions listed on my pass survived, but alas, I succumbed to the cold waters of the Atlantic that night.  Also, there was a lady all dressed up ""in character"", sitting on a bench reading a book.  I think I want that job even more than I want Gabi's job.
 
The dinosaur exhibit was... well kinda lame.  Big dinosaur robot things that sort of jiggled and swayed around.  We were naughty and touched one, and it kind of gave me the creeps.

Other than the name ""Kabob,"" the two restaurants have nothing in common; in fact, Kabob Je addressed every deficiency of the prior tenant from its lame pita bread to the rude servers. Its Matthews' location had become our favorite restaurant the past couple of years and we are almost giddy about having this second location so near by at Stonecrest Shopping Center.  

On this Sunday lunch visit (our first), we were pleased to find a packed dining room with its proud owner, Yasar, happily greeting us and other guests upon entry. His continual involvement and his carefully selected staff make every visit a special event.

You cannot go wrong with anything you choose from the menu and we have tried about everything. Normally however, we split the Mixed Grill Plate at $16 along with a Vegetable Plate at $12. The mixed grill contains one skewer each of lamb, chicken and beef Kafka along with yellow rice with raisins and grilled veggies. It includes a delicious white garlic dipping sauce. The veggie plate contains any four items from a group of about ten. We usually go with the toubolah salad, grape leaves, falafel and hummus, each made fresh in-house by two chefs that specialize in them.

The star of the show however is the incredible, freshly baked pita bread that is served with every meal. It is baked in a conspicuously displayed special brick open and is served piping hot. Desserts, though not made in-house, are also excellent, particularly the salted caramel custard that is so good that it should include a cigarette (even for nonsmokers like me). Hold on a second...

I came here during the late afternoon, a couple of hours before an Indians game. The place is a minimalist design so don't expect a Japanese themed sushi bar here. I had the Spicy Maki Box ($7.25 for 9 pieces) along with Miso Soup ($2.50) and the Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream Ball ($2.25). The sushi was delicious, containing fresh fish along with perfectly cooked sushi rice. The miso soup was flavorful but i still prefer the miso soup at Ginko's. Very friendly and attentive staff and this made my trip into Cleveland a pleasant experience (also it made up for the fact that I lost some money gambling at the Horseshoe earlier in the day).

Basically, you come here for those deep fried delicacies known as boneless wings.  I've tried the potato wedges, burgers, wraps, and salads, and all are average at best.  Don't waste the stomach space.  There are many sauces to choose from, my favorite being the spicy Mango Habanero sauce.  

Here's what you do:  

Call in an order of about 20 boneless wings just for yourself on a football Sunday.  Make sure nobody is home of course, this is going to be a shamefeast.  When you return with your saucy bounty, close the curtains, lock the doors, and get carnivorous.  Nobody likes a quitter, so just like a marathon runner you'll have to push through.

We ordered the brusselsprout shiitake mushroom stir fry... It was undercooked, raw, and cold. We had to send it back it was so bad and so salty!

Now for the not so great stuff, starting with the outrageous prices.  I'm willing to pay a premium for some hard-to-find beers, but $6+ for a bottle?  This isn't NYC/DC/LA, give me a break! 

Their wings are terrible.  The boneless wings were little, over-cooked turds of dried-out chicken that appeared to be sitting under a heat lamp for hours - tough as leather too.  Their roasted wings were chewy and disappointing, but not nearly as barf-eriffic as the nachos.  Any sports bar with a beer menu like this needs to kill it on the wings if they're going to get some street cred, this place makes Pizza Hut's wings look like Gordon Ramsay creations.

The atmosphere and facilities are okay, I will give them that.  Tons of TVs with sports in every corner and the bar area is large with plenty of high-top tables and seating options for your happy hour crowd.

The biggest issue I have with the place is its lack of identity.  If you want to be a neighborhood sports bar and grill, be that - but don't over charge and stuff it full of pretention and expect me to sing your praises.

My husband and I have been a few times and even brought both sets on in-laws. Everyone agreed how delicious it was and we can't wait to come back. 

As for sushi, we have tried the Rainbow Roll ($5HH), Pure Crunch Roll ($5HH), and Fire Dragon Roll ($6HH). The Fire Dragon Roll has to be my favorite with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumbers, jalapenos, and spicy poke sauce. Every time I order it, I wish I had ordered more since everyone likes it so much. I would highly recommend it!

We have tried almost all of their appetizers. The edamame ($1.5HH) were so delicious we had to order three of them. The pork gyoza ($3HH) are amazing and come with a tasty dipping sauce. The shrimp tempura ($4HH) are good but you only get three - which aren't really a great HH deal. The sliders ($4) are delicious - pulled pork with Korean BBQ sauce and served with coleslaw and fries. Two sliders come to an order, but with the fries, it's really filling. Last, but not least, the Korean BBQ pork ribs ($7HH) are amazing. These babies are super tender and fall right off the bone. They also come with fries.

Service 5/5 - When my family and I went there, all 3 waiters very polite, patient and helpful. They accommodated our group very well and never have i received the same level of service in any other ramen or noodle house, nor do I expect the amazing service that they provided from a ramen place. 

Food 4/5 - To be honest, I feel that all Ramen places taste more or less the same. However, Touhenboku offers more customization than pretty much all other ramen places I have been to, allowing you to pick what type of soup base, meat, noodle, etc. that you want. We also had a side of Karaage and I had a Karaage Donburi and both were really good.

I don't know what it is about a burger that has an egg and bacon on it that attracts me like bees to pollen (no, it's not bees to the honey, but that is another rant for another time).  I'm thinking that it's the appeal of breakfast, but the satisfaction of dinner that does it.  To say that this burger is big does not do it justice, to describe this you should use gut-buster.  This amount of food that you are holding in your two hands is enough to send you into a food coma.  Two thick slices of toasted to perfection Texas toast try their best to keep your hands grease free for as long as they can, but in all honesty, you should just accept the fact that there is no way you are getting out of there without using a stack of napkins.  The burger patty itself is cooked to your liking with the right amount of spices.  The egg is your basic fired egg, nothing special about it, but somehow definitely belongs on this burger.  The bacon people, my god, what is our obsession with bacon, I'm not complaining, but why in the world does it makes EVERYTHING better!  This bacon just crumbled once it hit the tongue.  Crumbled into salty goodness that makes your heart smile.  Yes it was that good!

It took me so long to eat this monster that I was lucky that my friend had gotten one of their TV dinners.  The side was nothing more that fresh cut fries.  I'm not going to go much into that as if you read my previous review how upset I was at that change.

The prices are affordable and comparable to any other chain restaurant found at a mall such as Cheesecake Factory. I like that they offer a number of gluten-free options including their pasta. The restaurant itself is huge with a nice high ceiling. Service was prompt and our waitress checked in on us frequently.

Lunch started off with a couple of appetizers including the beef carpaccio and calamari fritto misto. Although the carpaccio color appeared on the paler side, the actual beef mixed with greens, capers, and mustard aioli tasted delicious. I was disappointed that the calamari was on the soggier side. We were served the standard bread and Parmesan crisps, but I was annoyed by the ice cold and rock hard butter, which has always been a major pet peeve of mine. 

Lunch specials included a two course meal featuring a soup or salad plus a pasta dish. I got the lobster bisque, which was good, but on the salty side. I had a feeling that it was mostly filled with the shrimp to cover up for the lack of lobster meat. Nonetheless, it was a nice excuse to eat more bread. For my pasta dish, I got the campanelle carbonara. The plate was less than a full entree, but by that time I was getting pretty full. For drinks, they don't carry any beer on draft.

Although, I wasn't super impressed with the food, given the service, space, and prices, Brio is pretty fancy for a mall restaurant and a nice fit for Town Square.",2016-09-08 22:03:09

These are the things that some people are not exposed to/don't care/forget about for the newest (but not necessarily) better things *shakes fists*  I can shake my fist at the whippersnappers who don't know jack about the people who paved the way. I happen to live my life around music and anything that recognizes big breakthroughs in music I can get behind. I'm a music nerd that does not leave out any genre or era.

And the music was on point. . They aren't quite impersonators, but somewhere between imitating the artists vocals and doing a song cover. They also kept a few signature mannerisms/dance moves for entertainment value. I was very surprised that the vocalist were good and can pull off a wide range. One vocalist, Tom did everything from covering Sinatra, Elvis, Tom Jones, Elton John- artists with very different style and vocal ranges. I never forget about the band and they were on point too. There was two tap dancers that had really nice flair to their tapping that must be mentioned as well.  There was good dancing, classic showgirls and a bit of bird magic which was cool. 

It's just a fun kind of show and part of the fun is created by the cast. Jesus, you'd think some of these damn show casts out there hate their life (*cough* Viva Elvis *cough*) so this was refreshing since they looked like it was super fun for them to be doing the show. You can see and hear it when someone is liking what they're singing. Dancers had smiles all around. It didn't seem like they were going through the motions of something they do nightly- this was something that I can see they loved and felt proud of. 

The BF couldn't come so I brought an old coworker/friend with me. Now, this lady actually was at some of the moments they highlighted, like Sammy Davis at the Copa . It was such a treat to see her face all lit up like that since working in showbiz was some of the best times of her life. I got a bit extra than everyone else since she continued to tell me more of what really happened those nights after the show. 

It was a lovely use of my usually boring Monday. I would say this is a go for anyone who loves music, dancing, and vintage Vegas looking for something fun and lighthearted to watch.",2010-09-08 02:15:00

The way you order the food there is that you take a small order sheet and pick your order yourself and any add-ons that you'd like on your burger.

I ordered their burger, with 2 patties, egg, sauteed mushrooms and aioli sauce. The burger came up so massive, I had difficulty taking a bite of it. Taste-wise, it is what you expect from a decent burger. Service was kinda slow but within a reasonable time.

Unlimited Vietnamese sounds great but when they remove 75% of the protein from what should exist in a certain dish, all you have is leafy vegetables, rice and rice based noodles. 

The run down:

Fresh spring rolls: The highlight of the meal but nothing extra special, I think I ate 4 orders as each one actually had a full sized shrimp...and everything else on the menu was a bit of a let down.

Potstickers: They weren't potstickers but those cheap Sam's Club quality frozen and fried 
wontons...nothing like the photo on their menu...I guess they ran out.

Saigon Fried Rice: AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. Menu says sausage, shrimp and chicken. A couple of pieces of tiny cubed sausage among egg mixed with a huge heap of fried rice and some diced carrots and cilantro. Super huge portion...super disappointing as it was completely void of shrimp AND chicken. The sign says anything left over is charged a la carte price, so when they heard we had ordered it, the owners must have been high-fiving in the kitchen that they could fill us with rice for $30.

Rice Flour Cake with Shrimp: So-so...a bit oily, it came recommended by the elder lady owner. My pic looks better than it was.

Egg Roll: Was a very long, thin spring roll, not that great...at all. My date thought it was old.

Vermicilli beef spicy soup: Had this twice as it was a soup on par with what you'd expect flavor wise with a good broth except for the fact that the meat was embarrassingly scarce. It also didn't come with any sides to spice it up to your liking (Jalapeno, lime, etc...).

Chicken wings: Have had better at a lunch time Chinese buffet.

Vietnamese pancake: Huge pancake dripping oil with oily drenched bean sprouts and only 2 pieces of shrimp in the whole thing. A joke.

Saigon Fried Noodle: They ran out

Crab rice noodles: They ran out

Fruit and Cake: They ran out

Other Gripes:
-They claim to have 2 menus but most of menu #2 is just menu #1 written out in Vietnamese.
-They actually brought out another plate of fried rice without asking after we forced ourselves to down the first...No way, back to the cocina w/ that!
-Things weren't timed too well between courses, lots of unexpected down time.
-If you are only going to have 8-9 items for all you can eat...don't be out of 3 of them!

How much is shrimp these days? I think I saw them for $3.99 a pound at La Bonita for medium sized last week which is the size they use...would an extra .20 worth of shrimp per dish beat the house if your two customers are already spending over $30 with tax and tip?

Overall I won't return. The options and execution left a lot to be desired. With them being so incredibly tight with the more expensive ingredients I bet they could have turned a profit charging $5 a head.",2016-08-08 04:57:19

They sat with me and helped me design the most beautiful wedding cake - providing wonderful ideas along the way. They helped from the concept phase, to the picking the flavors, to helping find the best area to display the cake at the venue, to picking out the perfect cake stand to display on. Their to-go tasting box was also interesting - they gave a generous amount of cake and toppings to mix and match to figure out what combinations you prefer. while also giving great recommendations. The final cake we selected and designed for our wedding was absolutely DELICIOUS and we got so many compliments from our guests over how amazing it tasted - so fresh and moist. The design was beautiful as well - beyond anything I could have imagined! 

Another great perk is they will give you a complimentary cake for your 1 year anniversary, so you don't have to freeze the top, which is a great customer service and quality control benefit! They help determine the right quantity for your guests so you dont over order as well and have enough cake for everyone. Definitely would recommend them over and over and over!

It's very nice to be able to sample from several food trucks at once but the food trucks only offer regular dinner portions so technically you might only be able to sample 2 food trucks each Friday before you become so full that you won't want to walk back to your car. I suggest hitting up one truck for your entree and side then picking a different food truck for your dessert. :)

If I were to give any advice for a first-timer out at FTF, it would be to definitely get there early. If you show up at 5pm, you could be one of the first people in line at the food truck of your choice BUT if you show up any later than 5:45, you could be waiting in line for 30 minutes easily. The last FTF I went to, I saw a friend wait in line for an hour for a Papi Queso grilled cheese. Yeah... you would never catch me doing that. 

Parking is usually a nightmare since there is virtually none at the site so you will have to park somewhere nearby and walk over. You can park in the parking garage in the condo building across Camden for free. I actually park at All American Pub and walk over from there. Oh, and bring your own chairs unless you want to sit on the ground or stand while eating. There are nowhere near enough tables out there for everyone to sit. Also, all of the food trucks take credit/debit cards so you won't have to bring cash if you don't typically have it. Bonus there.

Got a Groupon deal, and had to check it out.

Food: surprisingly good. I had the Green Thai Mussels, curry taste and spicy that was good. For dinner, I had ordered the fried scallop taco special that had cole slaw lettuce and slather of mayo something that was delicious on a white flour tortilla. My husband had ordered me shrimp and grits platter for take home last month - and it was delicious!

Place: strange.. Lots of different experimented objects hanging from the ceiling, with addition of street signs. But the venue did not deter me from entering the establishment with Groupon in hand and good reviews.

Price: it is really reasonable. You can get good lemongrass dish for $12.99. All fish tacos are under $12. The only difference is the big seafood platter are a little pricier.

Service: it was pretty good, but not A+. But if you need something, they can get you your needs quickly enough. It was busy around 7pm on a Sunday night, really?",2013-02-05 15:22:27

Britt & co. are a pleasure to deal with. Prices for the macarons are reasonable.

The macarons themselves were good. They have a nice light, airy texture, but can get very fragile when at room temperature too long. They're also a bit on the smaller side. I've tried a total of maybe 10 or so flavors, and while a few were distinct and delicious, others tasted like they had little flavor other than the standard almond and buttercream. My girlfriend suspected that they only incorporate the flavors into the buttercream filling and not the biscuit as well, and she might be right. She prefers the lighter flavors though, so it works out for her. Ones that stood out to us were: cassis, blueberry, lemon, and pistachio.

I'll definitely continue to support them as they are one of the very few businesses in the Cleveland area that offer macarons.",2012-07-23 17:49:53

The chicken is similar to Romados, in the sense that it's moist but just a little tasteless as the flavour does not reach the inside of the chicken, but the skin and top layer is awesome.

The star attraction here is the potatoes, melt in your mouth, tender warm and swimming in oil, nothing beats them. Romados offers a ton of fries so it's better value since Coco Rico gives about 8-10 potatoes.I normally buy extra potatoes and ask for spicy as they are worth the extra calories.

Typically we order delivery.  On a normal day their delivery takes just under an hour so plan to order accordingly.  Today we decided to order and pick up as we were already out and would be driving by their very convenient location off of Durango and DI.

We ordered their antipasto salad and loved it!  It is made fresh with hard boiled eggs, ham and cheese, roasted red peppers cucumbers and tomato.  We ordered without the pepperonis and green olives.  You get your choice of dressing.  I suggest their italian or fresh made ranch.

We also had a chicken ceasar salad also prepared fresh with warm chicken on top.  Love this salad.

For pizza we ordered a large with meatball, caramelized onion and mushroom.  They are very generous with toppings!  On a side note, we got home and stuck this baby in the oven for 15 additional minutes.  Best decision ever!  It came from our oven hot and bubbly, just like we like it!

We come here on occasion for their awesome all you can eat lunch special.  For $7.99 you get pasta, pizza, salad and garlic knots with a drink!  Can't beat that!

It's tucked in the pack of a shopping center, and we were surprised at how big it is inside. The ladies behind the counter were very nice, and after learning we had never been there before, we got to taste 6 of their most popular menu items. After tasting them, I decided on a combo with regular refried beans, plain fried rice, jade red chicken, and a jerk chicken quesadilla. We took a seat at one of the GIANT tables they have and patiently waited before our food was brought out to us. 

Once our food came out, we quickly dug in. I really liked the flavor of the jade red chicken, and I didn't want to taint it by putting it in a burrito or quesadilla, but it stands up just on its' own. Being Jamaican, I liked the jerk chicken, it could have been more flavorful but jerk chicken isn't Chinese or Mexican so I won't fault them there. It made a pretty tasty quesadilla though. Something about the rice and beans didn't rock my world, it has a sweet aftertaste which I'm not really a fan of. Maybe it was just the batch? 

Anyways, I could barely finish half of it, and saved the rest for later. The cookie was a nice treat. I'll definitely be back and will recommend this place to others.",2012-04-13 20:43:29

He even brought my partner's sushi out before the salad and soup that should have come out in the 30 minutes we sat there waiting. After another 25 or so, we gave up on ever getting my (cooked) food and decided to leave.

Sadly, although we talked to a manager, he was far from helpful and just said the guy was in training. You'd think he would have helped, but he disappeared as well. I finally went in with a credit card and asked them to just box up what they had and charge me. This took another 15 minutes.

This restaurant is basically the back-room for AZ Wine Company.   You  enter through the wine store (where you can incidentally pick a bottle for dinner from their vast collection), then you make your way over to their dining area.  Don't worry -- if you purchase wine from their shop, they will wave the cork fee for dinner.

The cozy (read: teeny-tiny) bistro section, is dimly lit and sparse on  decor.  But if you happen to love candles and basic black everything, this is the spot for you.  Their menu is small, but the dishes are flavorful and well prepared.  Their website claims that the food is southwest inspired -- but that's not exactly how I would describe it.  The courses are more like French PLUS: French + Korean, French + Italian, French + Southwest... you get the picture.  The waiting staff is not only polite, and well informed about dishes, but discreet (i.e. they won't bug the hell out of you while you are trying to eat).  This is the perfect place to take a date.

We were warmly greeted at the front desk when checking in and asked what room preference we wanted.  They offered a wheelchair accessible room which we didn't need so we decided on a 1 bedroom on the 3rd floor.  I like how the elevators require swiping the room card for extra security when going upstairs.  On the way to the room, we could see the High Roller.

The room was clean and nice as I remembered the first time.  Home sweet home, even though it was for 4 nights.  It had the full kitchen which was convenient with leftovers and drinks (toaster, blender, and coffee maker).  The jacuzzi is a nice feature and we used it a few times.  I also like the 2 sink areas which is good when both of us wanted to get ready in the mornings.

I don't know if it's just bad luck, but they were shutting the water off again just like last time! But this time it was for 5 hours from midnight to 5AM so not an inconvenience as we were sleeping! 

I was really impressed with the service of one of the front desk agents.  I think her name was Gloria but she offered to help me when I was having an issue sending a print job to the printer from my phone.  She told me to email it to her and she could print it.  I did but she didn't get it but called our room about 10 minutes after to let me know.  I appreciated her calling me.  I was able to print from my laptop and all was good.  That is nice to have a printer and they give you directions how to print.  Easy and free! 

The one annoying thing is the Welcome desk left a message to get our welcome package.  There was a coupon for 10% off at restaurants and shops close by in Flamingo and Linq Promenade.  I was asked if I wanted to go for a HGV presentation and get a free $100 gift certificate after.  I said we would think about it and after this, we received daily calls and messages asking us to pick up our welcome package.  Obviously, they don't record if you have picked it up but only if you haven't booked a presentation.  We ignored the messages and didn't go to a presentation.  We may have if we had time but no big deal.  It's a sales pitch for them to up sell to HGV members.

Overall the place wasn't as bad as I initially thought during my first visit - although I thought that the BFs tonkatsu ramen was better that my plain spinach one.

Came for lunch today. Got to sit in a semi-private room (2 tables in the room) with a call button (Korean restaurants sometimes have a buzzer/button that you press to notify the server that you want them to come over). Menus are quite extensive. Most of the items are Japanese, but if you're in the mood for Korean, you'll probably find something that suits your taste buds as well.

Had:

Shrimp tempura lunch set ($8.95) - Comes with 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, 4 pieces of veggie, rice, soup, salad, and three veggie sides (today's were sesame oil broccoli, black peppered bean sprouts, and shredded potato with mayo. Tempura pieces were large, and fairly crispy. I would have liked the batter a tad lighter, but I can deal with this. Salad dressing was a tad more sour than I would have liked. Shredded potato had a good texture, but the dressing was a tad...strange for shredded potato. Other than that, everything was quite...standard.

Most of the service was quite good, save for one small mishap where the server thought I was done with my meal (even though I had two pieces of tempura left in my bento) and tried to take away my sauce. Easily rectified though. S'all good.

We came at 12am on a Friday night. I really appreciate how late they are open since everyone else is closed. They do that loud greeting thing which I find unnecessary since their place is very loud already. I also really like their decor and ambience. It has that dim, kinda hipster, wooden feel. (Unfortunately dim lighting = bad pix). I was in a very YOLO mood and got the hot pot H08 I believe and I wasn't a fan. I found it to be very sweet and at the end I was sick of it. I also found the discrepancy from the pictures to the product to be massive. it's literally a lie. We also ordered the shake that was advertised and that was also vastly different from the photo. I do not recommend both of these. 

We also ordered the soya bean tiramisu thing which was very cute, but we found that there was no coffee flavour which means it really didn't taste like a tiramisu. All the prices were quite more than the average so I wasn't that impressed. Hot pot being 17.99, shake was 7.49, and tiramisu was 11.99 or so.

The many times I have been Downtown I have always passed by Mickie Finnz assuming it was just another bar. I had no idea they actually had food. It is usually overshadowed by Hennessy's - the tavern next door that I used to frequent quite often while trying to max out my Jameson stamp card.

But back to Finnz - basically my friends and I needed food after drinking so much, so actually, this place was perfect. They offer a very eclectic menu, with some sandwiches, ""munchies"" (apps), and ""Buckets"" of seafood. I didn't really care to have a bucket last night so I went for a ""munchie"" instead.

I ordered the Chimichanga appetizers. I did not know what to expect because I was ordering Mexican food at an Irish sounding seafood place. (?) They came out naked aka they were not smothered with red sauce and cheese like you will typically get chimichangas. However, they were deep fried to a nice crispy exterior and hot interior of ground beef. I was surprised by the ground beef - usually chimichangas are shredded, but it did not deter me from eating them. They also come with a salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, and lettuce. You can basically fork on whatever you like onto each chimichanga as you eat it. The platter comes with four of the mini chimichangas.

Our service was pretty good, our waitress nice. Although it would have been nice to have had our waters filled a little more often. 

Like I said, I need to go back and give it another try. Next time I'll probably go for some seafood and get one of those ""buckets"" of fried deliciousness. For now I am giving the rating of A-OK.",2013-02-07 18:58:45

With the pot stickers (9), you get a choice of one of the sauces. We mistakenly chose the sirracha, expecting it to be soy sauce based,  instead it was a paste. I'd go with the soy sauce next time. The filings were fair but the wrapper was too thick. 

We split the ramen and we're glad we did because it was a huge bowl. There was sufficient ramen, bamboo shoots and thin pork slices.

Do not order the chicken & waffle. All you get is one waffle and snack-bar quality chicken fingers with it. Very disappointed on that one. It was like something I could get at a bowling alley.

The Good:
-Sushi is really really good, Avg price, sometimes surprise bonus rolls in bento boxes.

The Bad:
-place is small, but can usually find a seat.

The Ugly:
-The wait is painstakingly long. You sit... and wait.... and then you oddly start dipping your chopsticks in soy sauce and licking them in hopes for something to tie you over til you get your food. (And don't say this is unique to me....I've seen many people do it!) So finally after watching everyone's face who is has been waiting, get madder and madder, you finally get your food. You scarf it down and its good. You are full. But you probably didn't get your water refilled so you are really thirsty. But for some flippin' reason you keep coming back for more. 

And don't you dare think you are getting carry-out faster and on time. You will patiently wait the hour they tell you to wait to come get it.... then you arrive and wait 30 more minutes standing because they never actually made the food ahead of time.

Having just attended the opera, and on the same night of the Rock Hall induction, I was looking spectacular, as was my date.  I might attribute my extra-glam look to the special attention I received from the owner, who came to take my drink order and to inquire if I had just come from the Rock Hall.   I think he was disappointed to find it was the mere l'opera I had just abandoned for his fancy-pants restaurant.  However, he did stop by a few times to check in and make mild conversation, something I noticed he only did with our table and that of the one next to us.

The drink was good.  I opted for a nice Spanish champagne (have I mentioned that I love a good, dry champagne?).  My date went for a beer.  I might add that they have two of my fav's on tap!  Hello for a place that serves Left Hand Milk Stout AND Rouge Dead Guy Ale on tap!  

Perusing the menu was enjoyable.  I found the prices to be reasonable and certain dishes intriguing.  After discussion with my date we both agreed we would be back for more.

It was a surprising and pleasant end to a rocky start... (Oh, Opera Cleveland, when will you step it up?)

Stay tuned for an update.

My beef with this smooth criminal is that there is only one size smoothie to order, and that size is HUGE-NORMOUS.  I have never finished a smoothie from here, and when they are frozen they get icy and lose their appeal.  Offering a smaller size would be an easy thing to do, and I imagine more profitable as well.

The drive-through line is usually very slow here as well, since the food takes a few minutes to assemble.  

The food is ok, the smoothies are fantastic, just too big.

This place is the trifecta! .... Super Cool.... Local ..... Great Bloody Mary

Plus the other trifecta.... Great Service, Great Food and Great Bloody Mary

I know, I know.... I'm fixated with BMs..... but that's because so few places know how to make a good one. This place does!

And their food is pretty damn fabulous too.
Had their cinnamon roll which was gooey but not too ooey... with just the right amount of bread to dough-y-ness texture.... and really nice amount of cinnamon.  The icing was a bit too grainy for me but I'm not holding that against them.  

We shared their Pork Chili Verde Omelet, and the server was super 'on it"".  She had the entree split onto 2 plates... we didn't even ask for this... they just did it.  So Nice!

The Pork Chili Verde was meaty and savory and Oh So Good!
The eggs were fluffy and fresh.... not hard or fake.
The hashbrowns were standard fare but who cares.... the PCV is so good.

Definitely a great place for breakfast... and I ... will... be .... back!  :)",2012-01-15 03:19:29

It's a church, but they're brewin' brews at the altar.  Kind of messed up, sort of.  Though, let's not lie, you know it's pretty cool.

The food that I had was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We had the feta cheese/spinach pizza which had a generous amount of vegetables and crust that was just a tad bit undercooked for my liking, but still decently tasty.  The appetizer (perogies) and desert (blueberry ice cream and chocolate mousse) were all excellent.  

I'm giving this place three stars, because while I think it's solid, I don't think it's all that it's cracked up to be.  The beer selection doesn't look all that extensive, though I suppose you'd like it if you're big into craft brews.  The food is somewhat pricey and from what I had, I could think of a few other places where I'd rather eat for the price I'm paying.

THAT IS NOT YOUR CALL TO MAKE!   

Oh yeah the other employees name was Claudia. Team awesome right there! 

No someone should not have left their dog in the car on a hot day, but once an employee was notified they should've acted immediately. No debate! They even compared to if a child was left in the car and didn't seem to think it was as important. I'm glad the cops just showed up so something will get taken care of, but no help to your to customer service representatives. I am extremely disgusted that people like this exist.

The food was ok, it could have been great, but the small things were off.
My wife had the Carbonara, I had the Gamberoni pizza.

The carbonara was ok, there was just a little something missing, I couldn't place my finger on it, but it lacked something, I still can't place my finger on it, if I do figure it out I will edit this review. I will say, the pasta was cooked perfectly.

The pizza intrigued me, I had something similar at this place :

http://www.yelp.com/biz/oreganos-pizza-bistro-scottsdale-2

It is a pizza, with potato,  pancetta, shrimp, mozzarella. Oreganos makes it without the shrimp.

To be 100% frank I was worried about the combination, I couldn't get my head around shrimp being on this pizza, but I was happily surprised, the shrimp turned out to be the best part. This could of been a great pizza, except the potato was cut to think. If cut thin like Oregano's makes it the potato gets a little crispy adding a great texture to the pizza.

We really did like the setting, we sat outside by the fire pit, it was a nice way to have a late night dinner. The service was very good, attentive without being intrusive.

The 50% deal meant a check of just under $50, not a bargain for sure (including a glass of wine) but an ok price for what we got, if it had been at full price I don't think I would have been happy, so take advantage of the specials.",2012-10-16 14:17:15

One of the most recent additions to the Detroit Shoreway area Luxe is worth every moment. The interior is finely crafted metals and vintage mixed with Cleveland history. Everything has a story like the glass-fronted open kitchen (those brass doorways were salvaged from a Tower City Remodel.) I had the pleasure of meeting the craftsman behind the metals and he was so passionate about the work everyone put into the creation of the space, I was only that much more eager to eat!

We ate a late afternoon there and loved it! My husband's roasted portobello mushroom sandwich was juicy and seasoned so creatively. It had delicious bread that was freshly baked. The onion and garlic was divine! I had the cheese plate with the jam and tapenade...it may seem simple but the cheeses were so fricking good and again, the great bread.

I've been here plenty of times since it's opened- being roped into friends' gatherings, and specifically friends who love board games, I've ended up here many of a time.

For only five bucks, you can enjoy unlimited time of playing all types of board games- from old school (aka Hungry Hungry Hippos) to more complex strategic games to international games- this place has it all.

And the board games are clean- I was expecting them to be all nasty from people playing them, but it's quite clean.

The cafe also serves an arrangement of nice refreshments to fuel your playing- tea, kombutcha, smoothies, etcera. It's quite refreshing and convenient.

This place is usually very full, but we've always found a table to play at. It's chill and just a fun way to make all type of ""gamers"" happy, with their large variety of games.

We went with the Charbroiled Oysters to start :

They are dressed with Garlic, Lemon, and a blend of cheeses! These were pretty good!  Not mind blowing but good at around $12-13 if I remember correctly.

I went with the Blackened Shrimp Poboy on New Orleans French Bread! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?select=-rgLE3shfCXIeA1fprAIGg#09IBYP8kA8h-iBcCyldMuA

Great sandwich...just wish the shrimp were a little larger taking into consideration the price, but they were cooked well and had tons of flavor!  For some odd reason, I was served my sandwich without my fries though...they came later, after I took my time taking pics of both entrees, eating bites of both entrees, and starting on my second half of the sandwich, the fries finally came.  I did like the seasoning on them though...slight cajun salt style on some ""well done"" cooked fries.

The Bronzed Catfish and Grits : 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#26bezKK4tDMzoxIcy2zvdA

Fresh Catfish, Bronzed, over Smoked Gouda Grits with Andouille Sausage and Mushroom Ragout. Cooked well and very yummy! Would recommend it!  Portions were a bit small in comparison to other cajun/southern style places we have been to in town though, and the prices were not cheap (not expensive either) in that reflection, but still good.

For dessert, there was a miscommunication...we wanted the Banana Foster Bread Pudding but got the regular banana fosters instead :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2nBYfnTojNkJf_zpe0iAoQ

It was good, but not nearly as good as the bread pudding! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#6VaYCDgiODV53TnSZylS_A

It is made of Banana Bread / Bread Pudding, fresh Bananas, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Fosters Sauce! Very very good!! This was the highlight of the night for me!  The top of the ice cream had a slight creme brulee like crisp on it too!

Small complaint.  When we saw that we received the wrong intended dessert, we told the server and she ordered us the right one.  We had a bite or two of the wrong dessert thinking there might be some bread pudding hiding in there, but we quickly realized it was the wrong order.  They never took the wrong dessert off the table, so we ended up picking at it a bit, but still left at least 70% of the dessert on the table.  When the tab came through, we got charged for both.  I didn't complain or say anything, but the server asked us if we ate any of the wrong item, and I said we picked at it, but left most of it on the table.  She then offered to pay half of the plate costs $4 of the $8...

If this was almost at any other restaurant in town, the wrong order would have been comped.  If I would have raised a fuss, it would have been comped.  But because I didn't do that, Lola's paid for half..take it for what you will.

Overall, I can recommend this place, but the price/portion ratio isn't as solid as some of the other Cajun/Southern style spots in town, and the food was good, but not mind blowing good like Cajun spiced food should be!  A very solid 3 star spot in my book.

I was at a beer festival in downtown Phoenix and really wanted a hearty burger after all of that drinking and light railing it. Since, I run a huge Meetup group that prides itself on supporting local establishments throughout the Valley I decided to check out the Chuck Box to feed my beer filled, yet starving stomach. 

I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with Swiss Cheese. I am used to Swiss cheese having the wholes in it, but this one did not. I was a little nervous to eat it, but I did, and I am still a live. I am a major foodie and know when things are of great quality, etc. 

Moving on, the burger was damn tasty, in fact kind of hair blowing.  The condiment bar looked a little shady, but once again, I am alive and did not get food poison. The Bacon Cheeseburger came out to be a little over $6.00 just by itself, which to me is kind of pricey for what you get.

The service here was absolutely top-notch. We never had to ask for anything whatsoever. This place is class class class all the way. The ambiance was very soothing and romantic. 

But the food was the true star of the show, and man did we go nuts. We got two appetizers - risotto balls and the caprese mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Both were absolutely delicious beyond all comprehension. The caprese - my god. The amount of cheese you get with this appetizer is mind-blowing. The only problem I had with the risotto balls was there wasn't enough, and it's not ideal for sharing because there are 5 of them - make it even! Six would have been ideal, especially for the regular price ($14 - ouch, but sooo worth it!). But I was a very good girlfriend and split the 5th one up evenly instead of devouring it myself ;D

We also split a house salad, which wow - this thing would have been enormous if I would have had it on my own. Heirloom tomatoes and the right amount of dressing made this dish delicious, and I'm glad I got my greens for the day! 

Our entrees were also ridiculously huge and I'm amazed that I finished every last bite. I got the gnocci with vegetables, and there was an excellent ratio in my dish, about one veggie per gnocci. Very tasty but once I got toward the end of the dish I realized it was just a teensy bit on the salty side, but still very delicious. Matt ordered a ravioli dish that he enjoyed very much. 

Even with all this food and being full beyond all reason, we couldn't pass up dessert - white chocolate raspberry creme brulee. The presentation was amazing and it was beyond delectable. 

I am very happy we decided to change up our Dad's Grilled Cheese anniversary ritual for Ferraro's. From the setting, to the service, to the food, everything was absolute perfection. I will definitely be coming back again!",2010-09-05 21:29:33

My boyfriend and I used to go AT LEAST three times a month, but the service just kept getting worse and worse. We stopped going, but really missed the street tacos and flour chips and salsa, so we decided to try again. 

There was about 10 minutes left of happy hour. By the time our waitress came it there was only about 5 minutes left. I asked if I could get a margarita on happy hour and she said it was too late. We ordered flour chips... which we never received. Then, our waitress disappeared for a pretty ridiculous long amount of time. She apologized when she came back explaining that she was held up in the bar section. That's fine. Stuff happens. Then we finally get to put in our dinner order. We were going to split something, but I really wanted to try a navajo taco. Then she disappeared forever again. When we got our food my navajo taco was SUPER burnt, and completely not the kind that I had ordered. We had been there so long at that point that we decided to just go ahead and share. The burrito was good, but not worth the wait.

We're just learning about  this tofu thing. I had the Cantonese scallops which were cooked well, but should have been cleaned better- most had some grit. The dish was a little mild, even for this Midwestern girl. The crispy green bean app was really good- green beans flash fried in a salty tempura so the beans also stayed crisp.

Not in your typical China Town location, which gives it an edge for local sushi steakhouse destination.  The teppanyaki ranges from $12 for one option to about $35 if combination.  The meal comes with onion or miso soup, salad, rice or noodle, a couple shrimp, and the entree.  Portion wise, you will guaranteed be full.  Quality-wise, the shrimp and steak was very good, but the chicken and tofu were a little bland and underwhelming.  The noodles were yakisoba which is great as it offers a healthier alternative to a full on fried noodle.  The veggies seemed a little raw coming out, but once the chef did his magic, they turned out very good although very oily.  Hikari does have a couple of really good chili and teriyaki sauces which are a must add.

Another option is AYCE sushi at a little less than $30.  But, considering they offer some solid quality sashimi, oysters, sweet shrimp, scallops, and roe on the menu, you can easily get your money's worth.  Beer is limited to Japanese brands and there are about half a dozen affordable sakes as well as house for $6.50.  

Hikari is definitely a good option for a steakhouse experience on this side of town.  The chefs might not have the same showmanship as other restaurants, but the food will be good and cooked to your liking and you'll walk out full and content.",2018-03-28 00:10:36

More than once we have been to Thai Rama after 8pm and that is when a staff person decides to clean the restrooms.

I actually had my college graduation party at Zink years ago when they were uptown but their menu and the Zink experience has evolved greatly since then. 

They literally lay at the red carpet when you visit and last night I got to sample their new fall menu.  Previously I had sampled much delicious Zink fare (pretzels, yes!) but I want to focus this review on their updated menu.

I went last night with the intention to use my $25 off any $50 purchase thingy. Shocker, I didn't spend enough to use it! I wasn't even close. And I paid for my date's dinner. And I was full in the way they could have rolled me out.

Must haves (we split all of these): 

-White chili. They just won some trophies for this. Its that good. We split a bowl inspired by their ""small plates"" thing they are they are trying out. It does work for them but hey Zink is no Soul.

-Lobster mac and cheese. Bonus points for presentation served in a piping hot iron skillet. Huge chunks of lobster. Take that 5Church (I'm restaurant name dropping like crazy today!). Creamy, not healthy. Who cares. Attempted to share this. Didn't want to though.

- Brisket Burger. Its like three meats ground in house. Comes with fries, pickles and slaw. Just $14 cheapest entree by far but don't be fooled. It was bangin' and we didn't order if because it was ""cheap"" but because we heard it was amazing.

My date had a $6 cab sav that he loved and I had a pear martini. I forgot to mention the awesome house made focaccia bread we started with. We had two orders. maybe that's why we got to full.

-We also ordered the pumpkin ravioli but canceled it because just these three things (and the two orders of bread) had us full up to our ears. And was under $50 (INCLUDING DRINKS.) Yes the burger is that big you could split it and not fill gypped. Its super rich. 

Oh, and finally. The service was on point. Bonus no one hour Cowfish wait.",2012-10-24 17:17:39
oKEmUHwXa_ETfWvLLwCYEw,epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw,3,6,2,4,"This review is for their Fall Las Vegas Restaurant Week 2014 menu, which is also their $19 three-course lunch menu that's currently offered.

What drew me to Julian Serrano were the wild mushroom soup, rib-eye steak, and flan de turrón. For being a tapas restaurant, the portion size was larger than what I was anticipating. The price point was perfect, but the overall dining experience not so much. 

First Course - Wild Mushroom Soup: Nothing wild about the broth and the crimini mushrooms, which was the dominant fungi out of the mushroom medley. However, dip the accompanying slice of toast with foie gras cream spread into the soup, rather than eating it by itself; the broth brings out the foie gras' flavor. 

Second Course - Rib-Eye Steak: Both my steak and my boyfriend's were WARM. Our server apologized and promptly returned our plates to the kitchen where our entrees were re-made. Now, the hot, medium-well version of our steaks were juicy and tender.

Third Course - Flan de Turrón: A pleasant creamy, melt-in-your-mouth dessert. Flan can be incredibly sweet, but this wasn't. 

Regular Menu - Foie Gras: The tiny cut of foie gras was sandwiched in between a small apple cut in two. Although it may have looked appetizing and even cute, it's a shame that the apple wasn't sweet enough to balance the foie gras' rich flavor.

Service - Fantastic. Our server and the managers were on point with addressing our complaint about our warm entrees. My only major criticism: Don't push the standard lunch menu to customers and hide the three-course lunch menu, or in my case the Restaurant Week menu that benefits one of the local charities in town; the menus shouldn't be delivered only upon request. 

Overall -  Not as impressive as I was expecting, but certainly not horrible.",2014-08-28 23:00:45

My food however was very good. Short rib pasta. Rich tasting beef, as if it was braised for days. The date burrata was good, oddly the burrata lacked flavor, almost bland. But the dates made up for it.

We got there and were seated immediately upstairs. I think the atmosphere feels better downstairs bit its intimate upstairs.

Got the hot toddy which has a leaf for fir in it like they took it off the Christmas tree outside. But it was a delicious drink!

For appetizers, we tried the Caramelized Onion soup which I think wasn't that interesting. And the grilled mushrooms which was fantastic. The textures and earthy flavors of the mushrooms were a perfect compliment. It kinda felt like eating mushrooms picked from the backyard but in a good way.

I had the toutiere as my main made with pork, beef and venison. So the flaky pastry was fantastic and as a whole it tasted nice but for $26, the ground pork/beef/venison didn't really distinguish itself. I feel for $26 you gotta be able to know what you are eating and for it to taste special.

The Egg Pappardelle wit duck was fantastic. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and there was plenty of duck, much more than expected.

I felt the waiter was nice and always came around to refill the water. Was surprised he didn't ask if I wanted another drink, cause I would have. The food came out really slow though. I don't know if this is normal but too many times we were sitting there waiting for food. They should quicken this up a bit.

We had 7:30 reservations on a Saturday for a large group. My partner and I arrived a few minutes before then and our group had already been seated. It was probably another 15-20 minutes before someone grabbed our drink orders. 

Staff was friendly and nice. Huge list of daily specials they rattled off - between the long list and noise of the restaurant I ended up just focusing on the menu.

Our main dishes arrived awhile later - or most of our main dishes. Two of our dining partners had much longer to wait, don't know why. I had penne bizanzio which was good. I'm guessing I could have picked something more exciting but dental surgery the day before left my options limited. My partner had gnocchi alla mondeghili which he said was ""ok.""

My wife and I had our ""go-to's"", Kimchi Jigae (kimchi stew) and Soon Dubu Jigae (Soft tofu stew). The kimchi stew was well cooked to the point you get that tomatoey taste. It was on the spicier side and quite sour if you like that. The Soon tofu was spicy too and was packed full of soft tofu and seafood. The stew was so filling that I couldn't finish it. FYI, a raw egg is put into the stew before serving. Each stew comes with the usual bowl of purple rice and priced at $9.95.

The Mac n cheese was so good, you could drink the sauce. I contained myself and dipped my bun in it instead, mmm! The cole slaw was even more impressive IMHO, because it had some additional crunchy veggies to it, like kale I think?! I greatly enjoyed the fun, colorful, more healthy take on a classic.

The small restaurant shares space with Saryo Cafe, a Japanese dessert shop. I skipped out on it when I was at Konjiki because I wanted to try their soft-serve when summer hits.

I got there at around 11:15 AM on a weekday, 15 minutes before it opened. My cousin and I were third in line. No more than 10 minutes later, the lineup grew rapidly. Being third in line allowed us to get a table to ourselves instead of being placed at a communal table. I decided to go for the Signature Clam Broth Ramen. This can be a hit or miss for some people because a couple of my friends weren't a fan of it. I, on the other hand, quite liked it! It was very light and definitely felt like I had the healthiest ramen option possible. My cousin remarked that it didn't have much flavour. If you are a ramen traditionalist and prefer thicker noodles and a heavier broth, then I recommend going for another ramen like the Smoky Black Tonkatsu Ramen.

I was in and out of the restaurant within 30 or so minutes. You will get swift service and the manager might come by to tell you more about the ramen. I really like how efficient and attentive the staff at Konjiki Ramen was. I wouldn't say I am crazy about the ramen but I definitely enjoyed it. I recommend if you have the ability to go for lunch time, drop by at least 15 minutes before opening to get ahead of the crowd. By the time I left, there was a huge line up.

Shopping: They have good sales and always seem to have the product that I want/need.  Unlike other stores, they keep the shelves stocked.  It may be because they are not as high traffic, but I have been satisfied with the selection and the prices on the things that I get.

Grooming: The manager, Debbie, grooms my two girls.  She always does a good job.  One of my girls does not like to stand to get clipped, but she still gets a good groom.  The dogs do not seem to mind going there - they willingly go into the back and wait for a bath.  My male does not need regular clippings, but he goes anyway for teeth brushing and other services.  IF there are any issues with your pet, such as lumps or rashes, they will tell you.  You cannot always tell when there is something wrong. 

Hotel: I have boarded them there about 4 times since this store opened.  They have been very helpful.  I had to leave town on an emergency, and they took my dogs.  When a dog gets sick, they call and take the dog to the vet.  Of course, they call you and ask if they have permission to do so.  I call every day when I am away to check on my dogs.  They always answer and give an update.  They keep detailed records.  Also, unlike a vet's office, there is someone there 24/7, so if anything happens, there is someone there to take care of your pet.  If I plan ahead, I take food and treats for the dogs . There is doggie play time, but I pay for the three of them to play.  There is also a daily charge to give medicine.  The bill can be high, but at least I know that my dogs are taken care of and that the staff pays attention to them.  They even have a record of how often they pee and poop!

I recommend this store because the staff is friendly and it is clean and well-stocked.  There is plenty of parking and they have areas in front of the store for your dog to pee and poop.",2014-08-31 08:49:33

Sens was my favorite restaurant, yet somehow with Sochu, Johnny found a way to improve on what was already fantastic.

While I admit the location is not the best (especially with recent construction) the bigger space, the separate bar and dining room, the extra bathrooms, the expanded menu, and the newly added happy hour more than make up for it.

The expanded menu is exceptional; including an expansive tapas and family style section, and accommodates veggies, vegans, and carnivores alike. 

The outside patio is another really fantastic element. Thank you for the heaters.

Traditional chinese decor without being gaudy.  Quickly treated to free tea and  served crispy, fresh, non-greasy noodles.  How attentive!  Even the table has the traditional condiments right on it (soy sauce, real-hot mustard, duck sauce).  Nowadays you have to ask for these as restaurants are cutting down, and the mustard is not the great strong Chinese mustard--it is a watered down type.  Ordered soups: egg drop which had bits of chicken in it and wonton.  The egg drop was very good and the broth of the wonton soup was delicious--the wontons lacked meat inside or at least one of the wonton did not have meat but for $2.25 each I cannot complain about a thing! 
Ordered Schezehan chicken,chicken fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce.  I wanted to try the shrimp with lobster sauce after the fiasco I experienced at Qwik Chinese Bistro in Scottsdale.  You can read the details in that review.  This one did not let me down.  12 large shrimp in a nice, non-sweet sauce with water chestnuts.  Lovely and delicious.  Made me forget about the prior fiasco.  The chicken fried rice was a large, delicious plate of a multi-ingredient rice. Wow, and they added bean sprouts which i think really makes it even better.  The Schezuhan chicken was made without breading and spicy just as he ordered it.  What a great meal this was.  With our check came the typical fortune cookies AND as a bonus, wontons filled with mashed bananas with powered sugar.  These were better than you might expect.  Such a simple treat and yet so delicious.  They didn't have to do this but they did.  The service was spot-on without being overbearing.  I had to bag up the shrimp and lobster sauce that's how large the portion was.
BTW, pricing is very reasonable and the service was impeccable.

Had Durian smoothie and friend had Jackfruit the durian was not to my liking but I can say I triied it. 

Fresh rolls or ( spring rolls ), foot long sandwich with Korean beef was mine and friend had the pho' with steak flank. 

The spring rolls really good though I was missing basil ? I have been to a couple of pho places that put basil in them tastes really great that way, however can tell there really fresh. The Korean Beef Sandwich was really good I have a few suggestions though its hard to eat cilantro as a whole with stem attached maybe they could pick apart or chop also the cucumbers instead of slicing them on a bias maybe try julienne them this would look really cool to match the carrots they have its kinda hard biting into a amazing baguette and have to chew for five minutes with out chocking. The Korean beef was flavorful and tasted yummy. 

The pho looked amazing I also seen some pho dishes that looked like crispy beef or chitlins ? maybe next try that. The bread was amazing normally I dont get excited bout that but have had some bad experiences in the past either soggy bread or worse

I am not a huge fan but agreed to meet since it was her birthday. My other friend and I arrived first and scored a nice table outside as the weather was perfect. Our two friends arrived shortly after us and we all got comfortable. I just wanted to have a light lunch so I chose the Strawberry Chicken salad. My friend chose the Chicken Limone. My salad was better than expected with good flavor from the spicy pecans and the goat cheese. We also enjoyed really good service. Our server was always there filling up our water and tea. She was kind enough to take a couple of pictures for us too which I know can be a pain when one has several other tables to take care of. I have been to both Brio's here in town and I would have to say that I like the one at Town Square over the one at Tivoli Village. The atmosphere and the outdoor patio dining at Town Square is much nicer then having to inhale exhaust from the cars that are driving through Tivoli Village. I do like Brio's happy hour too during the summer as they offer some great drink specials at decent prices.

I must say once I posted my last Yelp review  the owner, Trevor responded to me immediately-within hours of the post.  He was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that I had hoped for. 
 
My second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and I was anticipating some kind of issues.  First off,  it was New Years Eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  We started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  When we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  The bartender (I didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with Corona shaped New Years glasses. ;)   Amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  I highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  Immediately we were greeted by our server Anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  I must say I was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors I mentioned above.  Anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  A simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   Drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  For 5 of us we ordered the New Yorker and the Cal Italia pizzas.  The New Yorker is the most amazing pizza I have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  It is topped with sausage and little pepperonis....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  Yum.  The Cal Italia had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  Seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  Not too bad for 5 people.  Others ordered spaghetti and meatballs (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the Romana  II (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  Everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)

Now we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  It could have been worse right??   Anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  We definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.

All I can say is FINALLY some good quality food downtown.  We've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  You can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  Thank you Trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  I believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  And thanks to Anisa for making our New Years Eve dinner a special one to remember.  Happy New Year Pizza Rock - my New Years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  Cheers!",2014-01-03 21:09:39

They are located in a very nice area with many restaurants and bar. This place always caught my attention because they have like a rooftop with a nice view, specially at sunset.
We were a party of 20 people celebrating one of my friends birthday.
We got there around 7pm and were sat on the second floor.
The place wasn't busy at all.
The waitress came and got or drink order. Unfortunately they only had beer and wine to serve, since they are changing their menu all the special drinks were not being served. 
The food options are kind of weak and pricey. I am glad they are changing their menus. 
The decoration inside is interesting and they can fit a lot of people  in there.

I had 8 pieces of chicken, my husband 7 and my friend 10. How come they have no consistency on their food portions? Also the wings were just okay, definitely would not order again!

They have a kid's menu that the girls know like the back of their hands and I like that it includes celery & carrots and ranch or applesauce or a small salad.  Not just fries (since those don't go over well with my kids).   The happy face potatoes are awesome too, but they are not fans.

Amuse Bouche recently was sold and ownership and the chefs have changed. This is also no longer a B.Y.O.B. Restaurant. They now have a liquor license and a bar to seat people. The restaurant has a NEW modern decor and has doubled in size and now has an enclosed patio.

They started us off with an Amuse Bouche of a stuffed mushroom cap and assorted HOT Breads with butter.

We started with the Risotto Fritters. The rice was a little overcooked but the flavors were outstanding and perfect. A tasty dish.

For Dinner I had the Grouper Special. The Grouper was stunning...It's a difficult fish to prepare and is unforgiving. The Grouper just melted in my mouth and I really enjoyed the Spiced Honey Orange Glaze with it. I did think the rice and slaw that came with it were a little too neutral in flavor but I really enjoyed the fish.

My husband tried the Beef Bourguignon. I heard it was mostly good. A few pieces were dry but the potatoes were rich and yummy.

We thought the Bananas Foster would be fun to try.

Chada Thai & Wine is widely regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Some even place it above the nationally renowned Lotus of Siam. I finally got to experience the upstart restaurant today. I knew from visits to the area that it's in a large plaza on the eastern edge of Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn. Its sign is modest, so look for it in the middle of the plaza, between a karaoke place and a much more prominent District One.

Chada only offers dinner service, and the interior is appropriately dim. Despite my photos attached to this review, the colors were definitely muted by the low light. The restaurant is also relatively cozy, with not much more than forty seats available. Despite that, it wasn't crowded at all on a Wednesday night and we were seated promptly even without a reservation. I also love the alternative rock that they play in here (Muse, Imagine Dragons, Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, and others), which makes this restaurant one of my favorites anywhere music-wise.

My mom and I were far more interested in the Thai than the Wine. We didn't get any alcohol, but we shared a number of dishes.

Kai Yang ($8.00): grilled marinated Cornish hen w/ spicy fish sauce. Moist chicken, nice spices, very sour sauce. Quite delicious, especially considering that it's just a chicken dish. Go easy on the sauce.

Panang Curry ($9.00): slow-cooked hanger steak in Panang curry. Rich coconut curry that still had quite a kick when ordered ""mild"" (results may vary, but I'm pretty sensitive to spicy foods). Delicious, tender beef. What more can you ask for?

Kana Moo Krob ($9.00): Chinese broccoli w/ so-called crispy pork belly. The Chinese broccoli was nice, and the sauce was also tasty. The pork belly was certainly not crispy as advertised. It was very tough to chew and a bit too salty, as if overcooked, and the pork belly skin that should've been crispy ended up being a sticky, chewy mess, as if it had been allowed to soak up the juices for a while. I don't know what happened here, but whether it's improper execution or something else, I'm really not sold on this thing.

Pad Kra Pow w/ sliced pork ($8.00): stir-fried meat w/ chili and Thai basil. It's a relatively sweet dish but doesn't go overboard. The pork is meaty and works well, but I wouldn't mind trying a premium protein (crispy duck, rib eye) or an equally inexpensive alternative (chicken, beef, ground pork) on a different occasion. Overall, not as impressive as the Kai Yang or the Panang Curry, but certainly better than the Kana Moo Krob.

Sides of rice ($1.50) and sticky rice ($2.50) complemented the tasty courses. They're reasonable portions for the cost. The regular rice is served in a bowl. The sticky rice is wrapped in plastic and served in a basket. No issues with either.

Prices were reasonable for the portions. We probably had one extra dish's worth at the end. Service was fine. Pacing could've been improved slightly. The kitchen had almost all the dishes come out at once, and probably would have gotten them all simultaneously had I not waited a few minutes on the Pad Kra Pow order. I would've rather had two dishes to dissect at a time rather than all four, so I'll have to remember to request that next time.

Based on tonight's experiences, I'll probably return to Chada Thai & Wine and delve deeper into their menu. I'll just be sure to skip the flawed pork dish.",2015-10-15 06:49:13

At first I thought I was walking into a huge lobby for a traditional Japanese Osento resort, the wood slats along the 30 foot high walls of concrete were reminiscent at Ito, except the orange uncomfortable block chairs were not, a table for 4 was huge, I imagined myself trying to talk over the din to someone across from me and can't imagine yelling the whole time. Due to the concrete walls, the ultra high ceilings and the open kitchen complete with grilling, the noise was almost unbearable. A dance mix of ""You give me Fever"" was playing and after hearing what the Dutch sounding Head chef yelling Hell's Kitchen like orders to other cooks, I'd decided I'd almost had enough, until a comped ahi tuna tasting menu was offered to me, because we waited so long. 
Granted, we had come on a Tuesday during Phoenix's famed ""Restraunt Week"" but still, overall dinner took 2 hours. But no one else seemed to mind much I guess it's because I was with the same old mug that it just seemed excruciatingly long, I would think going with a bunch of friends would be much better. 
The place was so busy with waitstaff, for every waiter there seemed to be 3 busboys or busgirls, folding napkins that were already on tables, clearing dishes, (8 times for my sitting) pouring soya sauce out of a little ceramic pot into our little ceramic dishes. Refilling our ""still"" water in little uneven glasses resembling pottery at 8 bucks a pop, sure it was Voss, but still! The wait staff was incredibly nice however, although shabbily dressed it seemed in orange wrinkled rayon, the busboys in sharp black looked better, and there were 2 manager looking people running around, this place was too busy too New York, too everything I am not. 
The food however was incredible! Albeit small, my main course steak must've been a 1/4 pound, yet it literally melted in my mouth. 
The sushi was tinged with Japanese pickle, Spring Onion, sprouts and even Japanese Plum, just about every delight that makes the seeweed wrapped slice of heavenly rice taste absolutely out of this world! I had never tasted sushi this slight but wonderful in my life. 
By the time desert came I was tired and a bit woozy from that wonderful Sochu Martini, tinged with cucumber that tinged my lips--2 in fact, plus my kirin which I had drunk...the noise seemed louder still!  
A square piece of hot chocolate desert with a chocolate stripe splashed across a sqaure ceramic with a small bit of cream, with another chocalate sliver, made it's way to my table and made me quiver and seemed to resemble a battle scene. As I sliced into the chocolate with my fork (so lovingly replaced for the desert occasion) the Hulk Green Goo that eminated made me not want to try anything fusion or this high priced again. 
My Cappuccino was in a beautiful cup and saucer but already too cold and too much froth. 
Even though we had come for our ""Restraunt week"" special we still ordered a lot more and the bill came to $140.00 for 2

The hummus appetizer also came with a very stingy portion of pita, barely enough to even eat half of the hummus.  Additional pita costs extra $$.

Probably the most off-putting aspect of the experience was the service.  We started with an appetizer of hummus but then decided to split the mixed appetizer platter as our meal.  Our interactions with our server misled us to believe that we could count the hummus as part of our mixed appetizer platter, so we only listed two other dips that we wanted.  Then, when the order came out, we had a platter of those two dips and *another* order of hummus.  Had we known that we had to choose three separate new dips for the platter, we would certainly have ordered something new as our 3rd choice.  We felt very misled by the server and she did not apologize when we seemed confused, though she did explain that the portion sizes for each of the dips in the appetizer platter were smaller than they are when ordering an isolated appetizer.

I think I'll give this place another shot to try some of their other food since there are many other rave reviews of the wraps/gyros/etc, and I bet the outdoors seating will be super cute when the weather is warmer.",2012-01-11 03:29:00

But if I had to pick the best sushi place in the area, it would have to be New Gen.  Maybe because it satiated me during long nights in the studio, or because they tend to throw in freebies (ice cream, anyone?), but probably because it was the most edible - take that, Sushi on Bloor.

The Miso Soup is just fine, and the California Rolls are rather tasty.  The Tuna Rolls leave something to be desired compared to what you can get in the States, but were the best that I had in Toronto.  And they have some really random food here too.... Shitaki Butteryaki?  One of my classmates ordered that over the phone and I just cracked up.

This is a popular place and gets packed - especially during lunch time.  The place is clean and ambiance just fine, if a little cramped.  But they also deliver - including to UofT buildings.  If you're getting delivery, you can get a party sushi platter mix and share it with friends.

They are against animal testing & won't work with any company that isn't. They recycle & encourage customers to bring in used containers which result is free sample goodies! They make everything fresh and I haven't tried anything that I didn't like.

In the gourmet, high-end pizza sweepstakes, Settebello and Ferraro's are still on top for legitimate Neapolitan-style pies as far as I'm concerned.

I had the the white truffle pizza which was a little too heavy on garlic and cheese, but still tasty and slightly burned on the bottom which is always a good sign.

The most impressive thing about this place is the small wine list made up of mostly well-chosen wines at fair prices. 
They have a wine made by Bibi Graetz of Testamatta called Soffocone (which is Italian slang for blow-job, no kidding) that I've rarely seen on wine lists in town. Plus a Testamatta Vermintino by the glass and by the bottle which is quite nice. (Keep in mind it retails at good wine stores for about $10 or $12 a bottle and is $9 a glass here.)

I'm someone who is usually oblivious to the behaviours of other people, but I felt like my boyfriend and I were being low-key discriminated against by our waiter tonight (we're Asian, young looking). I noticed that the tables next to us (same waiter) received much friendlier and comprehensive service than us; the waiter would periodically ask them how their meal was, and explain to them their dish. We didn't get that. The waiter would smile and make small talk with the other tables. Not with us. This waiter didn't even look in our direction while setting down a drink my boyfriend ordered (instead, he looked at the table next to us while he placed the drink down). In fact, I don't even think our waiter looked us in the eye even once during the course of our meal. For the record, this waiter (can't remember his name) has blonde hair, glasses, and wore slim jeans with Blundstone boots. Anyways...

I'm a bit of a large eater (read; bottomless pit), so sharing 6 dishes (4 mains, 2 desserts) and 2 snacks (the baked oysters) with my boyfriend left me feeling quite famished. However, I knew this going in so I can't exactly complain about the value vs. portion sizes. So, just a warning to my fellow bottomless pits, either pre-eat or be prepared to spend a pretty penny to feel satisfied. As Boralia is a much hyped restaurant in Toronto, my expectations were high. However, I left feeling a bit divided. 

We really loved the pine smoked mussels (presentation is amazing, the broth was delicious) and the pigeon pot pie with squab (squab was juicy and tender; the pie crust was buttery and flakey). The baked oysters, while tasty, didn't taste extraordinary to me and weren't worth $3 each. The beurre blanc on the grilled whelk was delicious, and the burdock/carrot salad underneath was great, but the whelk itself was just alright; it's good to try once. The venison tartare was uninspiring, and not particularly special. 

In the end, it's pretty unlikely that I'll be back - there seems no sense in me returning to a restaurant where I won't leave full, and the waiter won't even look me in the eye.",2016-05-10 01:35:24

Indie music is always okay with me, especially when they play my favorites (they did).

Meeting up with a friend, we both ordered the Alien Burrito. Hers was regularly prepared, I ordered mine Vegan with vegan cream cheese and mayo. A few minutes later, a spinach tortilla wrap with refried beans, copious amounts of spinach, red pepper, hummus, and vegan condiments came out. A few moments after that, it was half-devoured, and I was already stuffed. It was delicious! The fare was reminiscent of Seattle - good food, fresh ingredients with a conscious state of mind. 

My friend and I spent the next four hours just conversing, eating, and drinking. But what I enjoy the most is the friendliness of the staff. Never once did I feel uncomfortable or pressured to leave once I was done. They were polite in taking away our dishes, and left us to our own agendas. Quite frankly, the music had my won over from the first few minutes. With the food and staff in consideration, I may never leave.",2011-07-18 19:15:45

Years ago I became majorly sick from a Del Taco. Then a few months after that at a different location I got sick again and it was probably one of the worse food poisoning I've had. Sad to say, I've had a handful of food poisoning experiences, but it's because I'm food adventurous and it's just a hazard of travel. 

I've avoided this plague for years. My BF avoided it as well because of the 2 times he also got sick. 

Leave it to kids to not cook your food right....specially when dealing with chicken.

I saw on Yelp though when it comes to talking about fast food, this kept popping up. I know that fast food is nothing great, but in my area I have very few late night choices and one is a Del Taco. I got curious if it was maybe better than I remembered?

We decided to give it a try again. 

I got some del carbon tacos and a chicken burrito. Not bad at all. It has real chunks of chicken instead of that ""cafeteria"" style chicken that was minced and reconstituted into a chicken strip with fake grill marks which is a plus. 

I can't quite say I'm a ""fan"" yet, but it's A-OK. 

I'll leave them a positive rating though for not poisoning me though.",2010-10-23 21:34:08

Best deal in town or anywhere I've actual ever ordered from for shumai (large pork/shrimp balls wrapped and steamed commonly seen served at dim sum dining. The owner makes them himself fresh, and order from them... they sell 62 pieces for $30. thats a deal! We tend to order from here whenever we have to go to potlucks or we need to cater an event. 

Their cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don't just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it's the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain't stingy with servings here. 

They have awesome fried cream cheese wontons... and they're cheap!!! 12pieces for $6.95 you can't beat that price, coz you order from Rice N Noodle (not to bash on them) but you get 4 pieces for $5 something I think... just saying. 

Honestly I would give this place a 1 or 2 star just based on the place and display of the place... but they really are a ""Rice To-Go"" establishment... order your shit TO-GO or by the trays so your food is bomb bomb and fresh!! and you'll save money than ordering anywhere else.

The egg scramble was edible but I could have cooked a better one after drinking a fifth of tequila. Even the bread was cold and stale. That takes some serious technique.

Other faves are the Desert Racers (head first!), and Canyon Cliffs (steep and fast! Wedgie warning!) Also the Half Pipe is pretty fun too! Royal Flush was pretty dumb I thought and the line is always so long.

If it's super hot out, check out the kiddie zone. For some reason the water there is WAY more cold! Check out the tallest slide there. The other two are much too slow.

Wave pool is pretty big and it doesn't ever feel too crowded if you head out to deeper waters. Keep an eye out for people leaving and snag their floaties. Or if you're brave, take one from the people who ""reserve"" them on their loungers (totally lame they do that!).

Lazy river is pretty small, and boring so we only did that once.

I am a huge fan of Açaí and love trying new places because everyone's take on bowls is unique in its own way. The other day I had a craving and naturally, I turned to Yelp and discovered this gem. I've come here three days in a row since then, so that says a lot.

I was immediately impressed the moment I walked into Bowlology because the cleanliness here is apparent. There is plenty of seating and even bar stools where you can watch your bowl be made from start to finish.

The Chocolate Dream was amazing, but even better is the PB Lover Super Bowl! When you hear ""PB Lover"", you'd expect it to taste like nothing but peanut butter, but that isn't the case. I love that the peanut butter flavor is very subtle, just enough to let you know it's there. The smooth Açaí and peanut butter is absolutely heavenly. You can also get creative and customize your bowl by adding on toppings such as bee pollen, hemp seeds, or my personal fav, coconut. I can't have my Açaí bowl without coconut! The produce is always fresh and the toppings are plentiful.

The employees are friendly and are always willing to accommodate my requests. They even go the extra mile and bring your order to your table, regardless if it's a dine-in or takeout! Most places just call your order out and you pick it up at the counter, but this just makes the experience here a bit more personable. I love Bowlology and look forward to trying more items on the menu... If I can get myself to try something other than the PB Lover, that is. My only wish? I wish Bowlology didn't close so early!

But for xmas this year I got several gift cards and said OK, so this Saturday around 10pm myself and my gf finally went. 

The pluses:

We got Spring Rolls, Ra Ckin Shrimp, Seaweed Salad, California Roll, Rainbow Roll, Chili Ponzu Yellowtail Roll, Tootsie Maki Roll and a couple of Ice teas. 

The food all came out fairly fast, there was not much of a wait, and everything was great tasting, I mean the food was pretty good, but I wouldn't say it was great, nothing to write  home about. 

Our server Chelsea was great.  She was on top of our drinks and was very informative about any questions we had regarding rolls and making suggestions. 

The minus:

The hostess, was a little rude, when I walked in she didn't even say hello, she just stared blankly at the screen in front of her, and then just bent down and handed me the little buzzer thing  and told me they would page me when something was available, I asked looking inside that there were quite a few seats and tables available. When I asked her about them, she said other people were waiting to be seated at those spots. I then asked about our wait time and she said maybe 10 to 15 minutes. I would have like to have been acknowledged when I arrived. 

Ok...so we walked outside and went down the street to get a few samples of frozen yogurts. Before they could even finish making my espresso our buzzer went off. So we walked back in, less then 2 minutes wait, kind of upset that it took allot shorter then what we were told, I would of rather just stood and waited, then walking down the street and then coming back. 

Once back inside the other seats I pointed at earlier were still empty in fact they remained empty our whole visit, we were seated in the back, next to a kitchen entrance, where I must of gotten bumped into about 5 or 6 times by staff members coming in and out of the kitchen. I did not make for a pleasurable dining experience. And between this and the hostess which is why this place only got three stars. 

Overall, this was OK, but I have experienced allot better. Probably wont go back unless someone gives me another gift card, still prefer Zen/delux, Sushi brokers and Stingray over Ra.",2015-03-23 18:36:54

But amongst all that here lies Dino's pizza, a little pizza shop that you could (and probably have) passed by without thinking twice about eating there.

You wouldn't ever think the most deliciously crispy, thin crusted, genuinely wood-fired, and rustic pizzas are churned out here, topped with the freshest of ingredients, oils and spices. 

Dino's seem to have their pizzas down to an art, the orders keep coming in and Dino is there with his colleague making pizza after pizza, for delivery, pickup and a handful of patrons grabbing a bite inside the restaurant.  It's a no-frills type of place that you'd expect to serve up sub-par food but they don't.  Fire wood is piled under the large round oven waiting their turn to enter the oven fire.  There's something really rustic and flavourful about using a wood-fired oven that gives the pizza a unique flavour.

I tried the Pizza Italiano, Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Spicy Italian Sausage, Mushrooms & Red Peppers; we opted for artichoke hearts instead of red peppers.  It was a fantanstic pizza, one you would expect to find at a nice sit-down itallian restaurant like Terroni, Cibo or Buca.  The pepperoni and Italian sausage were flavourful, yet not over processed or fatty tasting, the crust ever so thin yet crispy, covered in the perfect amount of fresh cheese.  The herbs they sprinkle on top add the last aromatic finishing touch.

I had the popcorn chicken with rice combo ($5.99). It comes in what looks almost like a bento box. There was more rice than I could eat, a fairly generous portion of popcorn chicken for that price, and three sides. They have a hot table where you get to choose your sides, and they have a variety of them (at least 12, if I recall correctly). I had the eggplant, some kind of tofu, and some kind of seaweed.

The restaurant isn't very big so if you're coming as a large group, you might have to wait for awhile. 

We ordered:
- Chicken karaage: perfectly crispy on the outside, so juicy on the inside! 
- Spicy red miso: even though the soup wasn't spicy at all, the flavour was all there. Also really liked that it wasn't just a bowl of ramen with some toppings sprinkled on top - the bowl was immersed with food! 
- Black sesame tan tan noodle: the flavour in this bowl was great as well, and it came with a small bowl of black sesame seeds for you to crush and add to the ramen. It adds texture and another depth of flavour!

Overall this is one of the best ramen I've had. Service was friendly and food was delivered in good time. Will definitely come back!",2016-02-28 02:10:38

It was Sunday morning around 10:30, and there were three cleaned out bowls of Menudo on an empty table.  This is when I  looked back at the front door to see if I warp back to the past decade, and was about to get mobbed by a group of kids trying to sell me Chicklets.    No Twilight zone episode came about on this visit, but this Taco experience was pretty close of bringing back some memories at back street hole in the wall in Esenada.

Thanks to groupon, I bought a 5.00 for 10.00 special from them, and ordered a Taco and Gordita combo, and a couple of tacos from the front counter.    The counter girl was very friendly, and took my coupon with a smile, and told me that everything will be out very shortly.   As I sat down at the table, again I got another flashback when I looked outside...damn, this part of Sahara looks like Ensenada.    I had some pretty incredible party times in that part of Mexico, and started to remembering about those Tequila girls slammers, which was next door to a place that looked like this restaurant.   

My meal came within 7 minutes, and most of it was Carne Asada gordita, and one Barbacoa taco.     The went after the Gordita first, and this was my favorite of the entire meal.   They do grill it over a gas open flame, and it had good flavor, and more than ample of amount of meat.    The Barbacoa was very moist, and they almost can pull this off without any salsa with their version of this meat.    The rice, and beans were pretty generic, but isn't most places in Las Vegas at this price point.

Why a four start?   They forgot to give me my chip and salsa, and didn't tell me where's the salsa bar was located.   I walked up the counter, and was about to asks for salsa, but I noticed the three ketchup size squirt bottles in front.. 

They do serve most of the top Mexican beers, but this was the last thing I wanted to drink in a place like this.( For personal reasons..lol)  The food is great, but I didn't want Rod Sterling coming out, and telling me...you just drank a case of Tecate and giant bottle of Tequila , and you just entered the twilight light zone.

I was expecting better since my friend told me that it is the best place to have BBT in Toronto. I thought the same when I walked into the store since it is clearly operated/owned by Taiwanese people.

The waitresses are mostly unprofessional. For example, chatting loudly with their friends in the store to the point where one waitress was sitting down at the table and neglecting other customers. Others walking in/out through the front of the store to have a smoke outside.

-They sell sealed air tight containers that keep your tea fresh 

-If you haven't tried a certain tea they offer samples of course, but they also have the tea bar where you can purchase a 16oz of tea either hot or iced. They use their rock sugar which doesn't alter the flavor of the tea. 

-They also have gift packages available that I've given, complete with different kinds of tea, and the tea maker. 

I recommend getting Jasmine Dragon Phoenix Pearls with Rooibos Tropica tea (they usually give samples of this ) and it reminds me of fruity pebbles in a cup! This one is quite pricy per oz so I usually just get a cup of it at the tea bar. :)",2013-01-07 18:42:19

The shrimp was really good and the sauce was amazing too. I believe we got the mix of all the sauces. Can't remember what it's called. I'm personally not a fan of soft shell crab, but my husband enjoyed it. I felt that there was too much of the mushy stuff inside. The guts? Chicken wings were huge and the sauce was good too. I love that they serve their dishes with Cajun fries. I'm a sucker for those. I ordered some rice noodles and didn't know what to expect, but they came plain.

I started with some mini udon and nigiris.  Got the Karai Tuna, which comes with rice, wrapped in seaweed, and served in 2 pieces.  Also got the garlic tuna and the ono (super white tuna) with garlic ponzu.  The Kara Tuna are bulky 2 pieces of sushi.  The garlic tuna and ono came perfect with the garlic ponzu on both.  

I ordered the Big Easy Roll, but I requested to substitute albacore with salmon.  It's very similar to the Something Wrong 69, but with less action (which is fine because the Something Wrong 69 sometimes has too much going on).  Both rolls are my favorites, and I'm not saying 1 is better than the other.  Something Wrong 69 roll comes with a variety of fish, soft shell crab, and shrimp tempura and ponzu sauce while the Big Easy Roll that I ordered came with salmon, soft shell crab, and ponzu sauce.  I guess it's a milder roll compared to the Something Wrong 69. 

Everything I ordered as mentioned above was excellent.  The only item I thought that wasn't mind blowing was the mini udon.  The portion was a little bit bigger than a mini (bigger than I expected), and the flavor was mediocre.  I think I will skip the mini udon next time.

Nobody was willing to share their food, so I can only compliment the fish and chips.  Great batter, super juicy and perfectly cooked cod, some buttery peas, and of course chips(French fries for those not in the know).  All great and that entree was only like 12 or 13 bucks.  Not a bad deal for the neighborhood, although a lot of the entrees were more.  I would have gotten out cheap, but of course I had some whiskey on the rocks that cost that much as my dinner.

From what I've read on Twitter, it seems like a house kinda of club w/ house DJs (which isn't normally my thing) so, when I heard DJ Vice was gonna kick off it's ""Industrt night"" (for locals) on Mondays, I WAS ALL ABOUT IT.

I wasn't expecting too much since the last time I had high expectations for a club (HAZE @ Aria), I was disappointed.
But, Marquee was a pleasure. Very reminiscent of Tao. Which is to be expected since it's run by Tao Group.
And like Tao, it's super spacious and dark. 
And from what my guy friends said: THERE ARE GIRLS EVERYWHERE!!! THE GUY TO GIRL RATIO IS 3 TO 1.
So guys, if that's what you're looking for (DUH! Stupid question. It's Vegas). Then, here ya goooo.

The cool thing is there are more than 1 room in the club that plays different music from the main room, since there are 3 floors. (From what I remember!!?!??! Forgive me -- it was all a blurrr). 
One room is the Library room with pool tables, a sit down area, and waitresses dresses as school girls (DUH.)
There's the main room with a big dance floor and ability to see everyone on the dancefloor with the way they did the floorplan.
My absolute favorite part of Marquee was the pool area/top floor. SO PRETTY w/ all the cabanas and palm trees! Reminds me of Drais LA's pool deck.

Yes, it's a little bit more expensive. Yes, their French fries are skinny, crispy, and delicious and no, the chicken isn't dry or tasteless. 

I've had a drumstick and thigh which were actually really good since it was fresh.
Today, I had the Blue Ribbon sandwich and it was great, but, I thought it was a little dry and could go for more of that sauce. I also probably should've asked for more so that is also my own fault. But seriously, the sauce is like a thousand island type of deal but really pulls the sandwich together. 

The loaded fries were great and reminded me of toppings on a baked potato. Bomb but heavy. Hush puppies were also pretty good - crispy & corny 

The pickles they use/make were really good and I don't even like pickles. 

So basically, get dark meat for fried chicken, fries are bomb if you love them skinny & crispy. Lastly, if you get a chicken sandwich - get extra sauce.",2018-02-27 06:10:29

Place is busy during lunchtime on weekdays and does not take reservations. We were seated very quickly though. Very cute dining room. Not luxurious but comfortable enough. Food was excellent. Quarter Chicken (leg & thigh) was juicy and tender here. 

They take the orders a different way: you have to go to the counter and make orders, mention your table number, and they will bring food to you. I was bothered by the fact that they charge pre-tip in advance. I always tip but if I don't know what service I am going to get here, how should I determine the tip amount? I tipped 15% anyways. Great thing that all the staff we encountered were very attentive and polite. However I still find this pre-tip practice a bit counter-intuitive and may turn some people off.

The fountain machine serves a unique option, vanilla coke, and no this is not one of those all in one coke machines.My main complaint about this chain is that that some of the best items in the menu get taken away...

Last night this location was just okay. Upon walking in there was an extremely loud country song playing (to the point of not being able to talk over each other) and it turns out the employees were doing a line dance in the middle of the restaurant. I do know that Texas Roadhouse employees do participate in various line dances throughout the night but this location is particularly ""enthusiastic"" about it. Maybe Saturday nights are country nights? Not sure? But quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing.

My fiancé and I were seated in a very small two person table in the back corner of the restaurant next to a party of at least twelve. Our waitress did come over right away and greet us and our drink orders were promptly served. We did find a mystery substance on one of the rolls we were served which was somewhat branch like, maybe a stem of some kind. We ate the other rolls in the basket which were still good and warm. Service was good despite being right next to a very large party. The noise level was quite ridiculous. I also a had a three to four year old child directly behind my seat who was in the most shrill way possible screaming in my ear throughout our dining experience. Yay great way to spend the evening. The Texas Roadhouse birthday announcement was done a total of four times while we there (lots of birthdays last night I guess). It is tolerable maybe once but NOT four times. It goes a little like this - ATTENTION TEXAS ROADHOUSE IT IS (insert name here) BIRTHDAY TONIGHT AND THEY ARE TURNING (insert age here) CAN I GET EVERYONE IN THE PLACE TO GIVE A BIG YEEEEEHAAAAAW!! The party next to us was particularly intoxicated and just about blew my ear drums out with every yeehaw given. After 4 of these I was going a little insane. I needed a shot of vodka stat.

The food was okay. Not bad. The steak that I had was good. Cooked just right and tender. My salad was meh and my fiancé's ribs were a little dry.

a. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.

b.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.

c.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.

d.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.

e.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great.

After seeing a few quite decent yelp reviews, I decided to give Cookie Bar a try. Packing my bags and taking the trip from Summerlin over to East Flamingo we arrived with an intriguing sense of wonder as to what the Cookie bar was. Once we walked in two pleasant young ladies who happen to own the cookie bar, showed us everything they had to offer.

The first cookie that grabbed my attention was the Black Irish, Guinness flavor with a mix of chocolate!! Put simply, Heaven!!!! Next up was Tipsy Velvet, a nice mix of a lite alcohol and red velvet!!! I will say the blend is great. You can taste the alcohol but it isn't overpowering.

Checkin and get the free Buzz Kill Cookies...
They also provide Non - Alcoholic cookies as well!!! Most are in both versions of the cookies so don't feel you can't drop by because you don't drink alcohol, they are just as good!!!! The young lady also gave my son a Twisted Krispie on a stick which I can't seem to get off him!

Service here was amazing!!! For a family run business that has not been opened long, I give massive props!!!  Once the rest of yelp community swings by and grabs some of these amazing cookies, maybe they can open in Summerlin!

Cookie bar doesn't just sell from this store, you can order online and they cater weddings and other special events.

Knowing their food was supposed to be Hakka, their menu also indicated a Thai food section and a lot of other dishes. Moreover, their food seemed to be everywhere - no real signature dish or type. In the end, I ordered my own dish of Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and tried a bit of my friend's butter chicken (non-spicy).

I was really disappointed and so were my friends. I am really unsure why this place even has a 3.5 stars. Neither dishes were made at par. The butter chicken looked really saucy and bright orange, but it literally almost tasted bland as if the sauce was diluted with water - meat without flavour. Although my friend requested the butter chicken to not be spicy, it still shouldn't have tasted like that at all! As for my own Pad Thai, the noodles used weren't the norm for Pad Thai - they were thick and a bit weird. Likewise, there was not much Thai taste and aroma going into this dish. You can also taste the lack of peanut and fish sauce added. It was quite a disaster.

I'm glad the service was at least mediocre. They were kind to inform us of when their kitchen was closing and if we had any more orders to request. They also made sure no one was allergic to peanuts. However, we asked to doggy bag our food but the waiter forgot about it until he asked us again after everyone had paid for their food.

There are a few new items. I had the mango icee and was happy to discover that I got to have both pudding and tapioca in it.  I also ordered the Taiwanese sausage rice with tea egg... the taste is pretty authentic. the service was slow but the waitresses were attentive.

I'm sorry not sorry and if your a local and you haven't been shame on you! I love to escape the city and get lost in all the beautiful scenic views and hikes! It was my first time going to Ice Box Canyon a couple weeks ago and I do not regret it. So we aimed for a earlier meet up time but come on now it was Sunday and we'll we slept in. With that being said the sun was beam on use for the first part which was the worst part of this hike. No matter how much of a local I am I hate direct sunlight. So bring a hat and or sunglasses and less clothing because there's nothing icy about this hike well at least in the early spring time! It's rated difficult but as many others stated I found it to be moderate. The end result is beautiful! Bring some snacks and enjoy the sounds of the worlds tiniest waterfall. It's definitely a fun hike to do with a group of friends.,2017-03-23 02:26:17

Located in the super trendy Yorkville area, Pusateri's is an upscale grocery store where Toronto's richest come to fill up their top of the line fridges with Kobe beef flown in daily from Japan. 

But if you can get past the pretension, this is a great place to buy food.  The people that work at the various counters are all very knowledgeable about the sections (not like sobey's, where employees run away screaming if you ask where the crackers are). 

The steaks are to die for - I've had the New York strips here and they were so delicious. I've also purchased chicken breast and marinated salmon and both were to die for. Their produce is also really fresh and they have a pretty large selection, considering how tiny this store is. They also have a solid selection of cheeses, crackers and breads, 

The ready made food is also sooo good. The fresh spring rolls, salads and sandwiches are heavenly. And if you really want to splurge, head to the dessert counter and take home one of their ""Sartre"" mini torts. They really are worth it. 

It's not cheap, but Pusater's really does have some of the tastiest food in the city!",2008-09-21 20:34:24

Unfortunately, mine will be a bad one. I didn't go to the restaurant but my BF, his mom and grandma did and brought back food. Okra good highlight for them and that really was it. The meats were of good quality but it's wasted by not cooking it right. It was dry and so smoky, it definitely tipped me off that someone heavy handed liquid smoke. I thought this was supposed to be naturally smoky with wood chips? I'm a cook and this was not natural tasting and overly abundant. I smelled my liquid smoke bottle and the takeout box- same smell. 

I would like to see their BBQ at it's finest, the reason why they won awards but without a consistency- I don't think I can stomach going back until it's a good night. I'd rather go to Famous Dave's to get a decent meal. Not the best I've had, but at least there I can see where it might've deserved an award.

Overall, I liked that the ingredients were fresh, the menu was affordable with a good number of options, and they were flexible with my onion-hatred. I would definitely return to try something else from their menu - their poutine sounds delicious.

Line stretched out the door (and there was an equally long line to pay) but so many people gave up that even though there were 20(!) parties ahead of us, it only took us ~30 minutes to be seated. Someone tried to steal our table but the hostess thankfully blocked them.

Doesn't compare to the dim sum I've had in Hong Kong, NY, or LA. Probably on par with what I've had in San Francisco and San Diego. They have a chaotic, inefficient system, not like the well-oiled machines I'm used to for dim sum. Between carts and going up to order at the kitchen, in 20 minutes we had only managed to get 3 dishes. Took 3 people to get our tea.

Guk faa cha: only $1/person for chrysanthemum tea! I like how they give you the rock sugar on the side, though we didn't use it. They were slow to refill our teapot, with lukewarm, not hot, water.

Cart items were mushy from sitting around, which was surprising considering how busy it was. The cart ladies would often pass us by in the corner where we were sitting.

Ha cheong fun: wrapper is a bit mushy. Shrimp on the small side. The 2nd round hadn't been sitting as long as the 1st so was marginally better, but still too squishy for my taste. 3 to an order.

Pork & chive dumpling: though they smelled good, they were bland, greasy, and the filling was hard. I felt like a dog gnawing on a rubber ball. There was supposedly shrimp in this but I didn't see or taste any. 3 to an order.

Bat tong go: sliced too thin so the edges were dried out and crunchy. Also small - I should not be able to shove an entire slice in my mouth. A touch too oily. Just the right amount of sweetness though. Comes 4 to an order but they're relatively small pieces compared to what I'm used to.

Ha gao: these we managed to get right after they were made. Instead of a shrimp ball there were 2 whole shrimp inside each one, though the shrimp they used were again on the small side. Even so, this was the third best thing we had. Getting it fresh made all the difference between this and the ha cheong. 4 to an order.

Malaysian roti: the best thing we had. Even the roti by itself was so delicious it almost was a shame to cover up the flavor with curry, even though the curry was also super-delicious. Comes with a little ramekin of delicious curry (which had some chickpeas and a few small chunks of potatoes in it). There's a serious bottleneck producing them as they're made fresh to order, there's only one pan to make them in, and only one fits in the pan at a time. Got 2, though we could have eaten a pile of them. Menu says it's vegan. Worth coming back for.

Xiao long bao (soup dumplings): the flavor was good and not sweet but there was no soup inside and the bottoms of the wraps were soggy. Despite their flaws, these were slightly better than the XLB Fat Dumpling (which I also like but don't love). Comes 3 to an order and are on the slightly small side for XLB.

Daan tat (egg custard): ordered this at the kitchen. They said they would bring it to our table but didn't ask where our table was. Half an hour later we still had none and could not find anyone who knew what was going on with them. Finally they arrived hot out of the oven nearly 45 minutes later. They were delicious (mostly because they were just made). I haven't had fresh hot daan tat in a long time so this was a nice treat. The second best thing we ate here. Comes 2 to an order and are the normal size kind, not the minis.

Steamed sponge cake: not what I was expecting. Tasted like sweet cornbread but with some almond cookie notes. Not bad but not what I wanted. They are not consistent with the size of the slice they give you, but they give you a huge hunk at least the size of your face.

Mushroom mai (shrimp and pork-stuffed mushrooms): they said they were out when we tried to order it but it came by on a cart later so we grabbed one. The shrimp and pork ball had the same problem as the chive dumpling filling in that I did not taste any shrimp, but these were less rubbery and had better flavor. 3 to an order.

They were out of veggie and potato curry puffs and pan-fried potstickers.

We did not get any of the noodle dishes, though it's of note that they give you your choice of wide or narrow rice noodles or thin egg noodles (I prefer wheat noodles to rice or egg noodles though).

Due to reaching our sweets threshold, we didn't try to get our other sweet favorites like dau saa bao (red bean buns), red bean sesame balls, mango pudding, tofu faa (sweet silken tofu), or golden lava custard buns.

The tables, chairs, and cafeteria area are not very posh but the dozens of wooden bird cages hanging from the ceiling are cute, and the floor tiles and booths look fairly new.

I must say that the waitresses were very attentive and efficient, even with a full house to serve.  Service was surprisingly good - those 4 waitresses deserve gold stars.

I ordered the Unagi Don ($11.95) which comes with miso soup, and an iced taro milk tea ($2.00 w/ the meal).  The Unagi was nice, soft, and tasty - I quite enjoyed it.  The dish was also garnished with edamame, cantaloupes, and seaweed.  The iced taro milk tea was a bit sweet but I still enjoyed it (don't order it if you left your sweet tooth at home).

The decor was exceptional as well.  Moji is decorated with wooden tables, mismatched chairs, and cutesy colours.  Accompanying the decor is a very kawaii Japanese soundtrack.  Both of these contributed to an atmosphere with 0ppm testosterone.

Moji brings something new to the table in a Markham that's saturated with Chinese restaurants and AYCE's.  It's my new favourite spot for an affordable, tasty meal.",2016-02-02 23:30:33

Here The Bird: Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (one-half free range chicken) is brined 27 hours, which results in consummate tenderness and moist chicken meat.  There is a slight kick to the skin of the animal, but not to the top-drawer meat inside.  Tabasco Honey is served on the side if one wants an even more spiced up bird.  But it added nothing to the tastiness of the fowl for me, which in fact lived up to all of the hype this Southern Fried Chicken has been receiving as of late.

To enhance my lunch entree I opened with an appetizer that towered over the plate: suitably cold, salty, and trouty-tasting Deviled Eggs with fresh dill, Smoked Trout Roe (""Redneck Caviar""), and a little paprika sprinkled on top.  Deviled Egg was also utilized as a base to adhere the bottom of the hard-boiled egg to the appetizer platter.  

House-Cut Fries came with Buttermilk Dipping Sauce and Bacon Salt, and an order of fresh house-baked Buttermilk Biscuits was rewarded with soft biscuits, Honey Butter, and a sensational tasting dark Strawberry Jam.

Throughout the meal, hard-driving Southern music played while photos of iconic personalities like Elvis, James Brown, and Muhammad Ali were projected on the wall.

Servers were friendly and knowledgeable, but service was sporadic, and chicken, fries, and biscuits arrived at the table individually, in shifts.  I had to ask another busgirl for extra Honey Butter, and a busboy for more water.  

The food was great.  And, overall, this was a nice experience which bears repeating once food preparation becomes better coordinated and initial service kinks have been kneaded out.",2015-02-07 07:36:10

Not your typical Mexican joint, chips and salsa aren't included but are delicious and both appear to be made fresh. Service was pleasant, but slow both times I've been there. Had Carne Asada Tacos for the first visit -  really yummy. My Mom had fish tacos and loved them. Second visit today I tried the Ceviche and it was a bit of a disappointment, For $10.95 - there was probably only about 3-4 shrimp chopped in the roughly 1-1.5 cup portion, and the the jalapenos were chopped way to large so it was too hot. Comes with a huge order of chips, but Salsa was an up charge. Feels a little nickle & dimey.

Toppings on the burger were delicious and the white bun was just right. They turkey party itself was nothing to brag about and a little dry and lacked real taste - thank goodness for toppings! The onion rings were one of the best I've had with the onions just right and a very light coating. The ranch dressing was good, but definitely too runny for dipping and was certainly aiming for my shirt the whole time.

My partner ordered a Hawaiian burger on brown with the chicken breast option (the burger I am told was delicious)and sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries, and they were not very impressive - ok but certainly not the best (get the onion rings if you go). 

Service was ok and about average wait speed.

I don't usually comment on bathrooms, but these were in great need of a good clean up, paper every where and floors definitely need a deep clean.

This is not my first time at this resort, but I decided to have a vacation with my family here and it was absolutely disappointing. The first day was wonderful and filled with activities but the second day I feel like I was mistreated and ignored by your staff. I had brought my friend into your resort for an early dinner I sat in the communal area below the lobby and didn't receive service for 15 minutes so I asked for a manager at the top. After speaking with the manager I was told I would receive a prompt service, after sitting back down for an additional 10 minutes no one had stopped by to take my order or even ask if I needed a drink. I was embarrassed that I brought my friend here and even after I pulled teeth for a server (on a non-busy day) the service was lack-luster and rude. I am a business owner and was expensing this entire trip on my business card, so the opportunities could have been limitless for staff. But instead of serving me they treated me with rudeness that I will not forget. After leaving such a sour taste in my mouth, I called the manager once again from my phone inside of the room, he assured he would do something to make it up but I never heard back. Then when I went back to the front desk he said ""you guys were on camera being served"" I asked if he saw this because was in disbelief and he said ""no I didn't physically see it"". OMG. Then when I asked for the corporate email they said they had no idea what it was and that I could ""find it on google"". This was one of my favorite resorts in the area and I'm so disappointed to say I will never be staying here again.

I typically have tons to say about restaurants around here, but I'm pretty content on just stating it's awesome and easy. My opinion is also limited as the chicken and chips is prime eating for me.

Service at this place is phenomenal!  Great hostess, terrific waitress (Ashley?) and super support team.  The only off note was the douchebag bartender who was at least honest when he said that if you want good beer you can't get it there but lose the attitude bro; you're not guest starring on an episode of ""NCIS: Los Angeles"" yet.

Food is amazing...we had oysters, french toast foie gras, steaks, mac and cheese, parmesan fries, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  My steak (at 10 oz strip) was well prepared and the accompanying horseradish sauce was epic.  However, for $41 I thought it was a bit pricey.

So you see me use words like ""phenomenal"" and ""amazing"" and you're thinking ""But Bill, you only give this place four stars.  What's up with that, yo?""

Let me break it down for you.  The things that keep it from being five stars are: 
1. Limited beer options -this is a steak house, not some OB/GYN office, right?  I mean do you want to give me a Brazilian while you force me to drink a cosmo?  Sheesh.
2. Extraordinary prices.  OMG this place is expensive.
3. The one person per use bathrooms.  There was always a line and for a men's room that's unnecessary.  We can use troughs, for heaven's sake.
4. Bathroom attendant.  Since you have to stand in the hall to wait for the can, you're sort of forced to make small talk with the guy who is awkwardly blocking the en trace to the loo.  Just not my cup of tea.
5. Great music but loud and thumpy (sort of like a date I had once).  Is this a club or a restaurant.  Prepare to be hoarse from screaming and deaf from the music after eating here.

I agreed to go because since its opening I still hadn't been to Tivoli Village.  I'm for 'yuppie-ism' in many cases, and seeing how rich people sometimes like to spend their money just amazes me (and somewhat annoys me at the same time).  But to each their own.  Who am I to tell the local Summerlin millionaire that the restaurant chains they visit are often vastly inferior to the local Mom & Pop Italian deli down the way?  They'll probably just scoff then go back to their yuppie gym (I'm looking at you David Barton) where apparently only people with 8+ abs, and Armani workout clothes can sweat it out.  Yes, I am in fact wearing last, last, last season Adidas sneakers (but in my defense they are a rare blue pair) and a pleather jacket.  

Tivoli Village was nice, but I was right in that it caters to specific clientele.  I like window shopping (unlike my homeboy 50 Cent) and wow, 'what-I-cannot-afford-even-if-I-tried' syndrome took over.  But I digress on back to eating (and fantasizing I was P-Diddy's hidden 16 year old bastard son).

Seems like Brio is one of the only restaurants that has survived the turmoil of Tivoli Village.  A number of eateries here have come and gone over the year.

Now I can only comment on their late night Happy Hour after 9 PM in the bar area.  I will have to try the regular restaurant some other time if we ever go back.  The hostesses were nice, showed us exactly where the bar area was in no time.  Seats were open, and we were told to sit anywhere in the bar for Happy Hour.  We chose a nice little table towards the wall section.  Our waitress was quick, and asked if we were interested in some drinks or if we were going to stick around for Happy Hour.  We told her we indeed there for Happy Hour and were immediately offered one of their bar plate menus.  

There are a decent number of dishes available during Happy Hour, around 10 or so.  The pricing is good, between $4 - $6 each.  There are a number of drink specials as well.

I stuck with a Peroni beer for $4, not exactly a value, but apparently it's cheaper than normal.  Really?  Damn markup must be massive!  The wifey and I wanted to share the Black Pepper Shrimp plate, but according to our waitress they were out of the cream sauce for it.  Huh?  How hard is it for a kitchen to whip up a cream sauce exactly?  I certainly hope you have an ITALIAN kitchen that can make cream sauces all day long!  Alfredo, anyone?  Was just beyond me but OK.  We opted for the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip instead.  We also got an order of Beef Carpaccio, and two BRIO burgers.

Plates took around 20 minutes to arrive, average for most restaurants.  But it wasn't exactly busy when we were there so I don't know what the holdup was.  I gotta say though that our plates weren't exactly news to write home about.  Yes, I know it's Happy Hour, and yes I know the pricing is considered 'cheap', but come on now.  These were some ugly looking plates!  Poorly executed for the most part.  The Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with flatbread triangles was alright.  It seemed to be sitting under the heat lamp for a bit on the long side, top layer of it was hard.  It tasted ok, but should I be ashamed to say it tastes like something I can pick up at Costco?  Let me get on with the BRIO burger.  Wow.  $5 for this?  A thin burger patty with Provolone and roasted tomato mayo on what looks like a Costco hamburger bun?  And a side of housemade 'chips', once again, that could be from Costco?  Now before you get your panties in a twist, I adore Costco and shop there weekly (and drink a kale shake almost daily).  I'm just saying, if I can make the same stuff from ingredients at Costco, why go to Brio?  Why?  And this BRIO burger was plated funny too.  A 5-year old can make a plate better than this.  The burger, no lettuce, no tomato?  Cut into four pieces, and chips stuffed in the middle of the plate?  Rookies!  It didn't taste the greatest either.  Burger was overcooked and dry, the cheese was near non-existent, the roasted tomato mayo was barely there, and there was too much bun!  For the price I could have gone to Wendy's right nearby and gotten a bigger burger.  Just so-so for me.  The best item of the night was the Beef Carpaccio.  Ultra thin slices of raw beef, topped with dressed field greens, capers, a mustard aioli, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.  This plate was DELICIOUS.  Beef was nice and cold, greens had great crunch, capers and the mustard aioli added a nice bite, and the cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor.  We heartily ate this up.  All for $4!  Next time I won't waste any effort and just get two orders of carpaccio.  And maybe a Peroni.

And to those who have complained about not being told up front or that there should be meat options let me explain that there is a good reason it is vegetarian. You are dining in PITCH BLACKNESS using your hands most if the time because using a knife would be impossible. Also with meat you run the risk of temperature issues. Imagine trying to bite in to meat or grabbing meat that is too hot, or with fish having issues with bones. So as someone in the business I say to those who are put off by the fact it is vegetarian I say to you suck it up and try it, a vegetable won't kill you and your going for the experience and that is the best part.
Now moving on yes this place is PITCH black the only thing you can see is the floating light from the staffs night vision goggles. 
My advice is too sit with closed eyes because trying to see any light puts a strain on your eyes. 
Matt was our server and he was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. He really made our experience and if you go ask for him.

This time I ordered the chef's tasting menu which is a five course dinner featuring ""the best of the best signature dishes"" from Chef Katsuya Uechi.  That's a quote from the menu.

Course 1 was an appetizer sampling.  There were four items--creamy rock shrimp, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, crispy rice with spicy tuna, and spicy albacore sashimi with crispy onion.  The spicy albacore was hands down the best of the four but they were all good.

Course 2 was a ceviche of sashimi with yuzu and lime.  Very refreshing, served with a spoon, but I found it difficult to eat with a spoon so I used my chopsticks.  Much easier!  I believe this was meant to be the first course but it didn't matter.  It was small but very tasty.

Course 3 was miso marinated black cod.  The fish was superb.  Soft, moist, and very flavorful.  It was almost impossible to pick up using chopsticks but I managed to do it. 

Course 4 was the sushi course.  There were 5 pieces of nigiri style sushi.  Pretty standard.  Nothing exceptional but good.

Course 5 was dessert and I asked my server about two potential choices from the ones they serve.  He recommended the Yuzu tart and it was perfect.  A very pleasant, light dessert and a super way to finish this meal.

The restaurant was quite busy and alive tonight.  My server, Ken, was spot on with everything he described.  His knowledge of the menu was exactly what I needed in deciding to do the tasting menu or to order à la carte.  He was efficient, polite, and pleasant.

I really like this restaurant and after talking with a young couple next to me, I know have to come back and try some more dishes from the menu--the lobster dynamite being high on my list.  Eventually, I'll eat my way through the entire menu.  That's not a bad idea.",2015-02-23 05:23:55

We have gone to every one that they have hosted, and have always thought it was great and would spread the word.  This year.....ah not so much.  They used to have free drinks with the ticket, which they ended last year so we knew this going in.  As for the food.....its always been on point with quality and vareity, but not this year.  The crab legs (which is the big draw for us) were simply put not that great.  Real rubbery, so I waited till they brought out new ones....same product. And no prime rib this year....cmon man.   And how do you have sushi rolls with out wasabi and soy sauce.  The drink specials were ok.  So next year we are gonna have to find a spot.

Well, because of their certain, extreme stances (gay marriage) back in 2012, and all of the hurt and angry hearts caused by the aftermath. I mean, I am not gay, but I do have loved ones (family and friends) who ARE gay, and so this hits home with me. And, even if I didn't have loved ones around me, it would still bother me because it just doesn't seem right...Huge heart for my loved ones and their protection, as well as justice for those who are part of any kind of minority and suffering opposition, teasing, etc.

I mean, their president and COO announced that they are ""very much supportive of the family - the biblical definition of the family unit"". This ""biblical unit"" did not meet the same family unit definition that many members of the LGBT. 

This whole mess did cause significant damage to Chick-fil-A's reputation as well as lost many loyal customers, as mayors in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco stepped in to ban any future Chick-fil-A stores being built further on (unless some changes/apologies were made).

On a personal note, I was working for a major Fortune 500 company at the time of this, and my ER Director happened to be gay. She was a very reputable person within our business, and had a long-time girlfriend, as well as tons of dogs. My Director, at the time, barked out some colorful words regarding Chick-fil-A, and I remember feeling bummed that it had to come to this. I dunno...

Our company at the time was coordinating a celebration of diversity within our company, to offer free food, speakers, games, give-aways, etc. When I sat down at our first planning meeting an noticed Chick-fil-A as one of the food vendors, I couldn't help but raise my hand on this on. The more I talked about my concerns and the possible negative responses, perceptions if we serve food from this restaurant, the more nods I got from my peers and Managers. It was unanimious - they were out, and we needed a replacement.

Now that it's 2016, things have simmered down a bit. I know the entire topic hasn't been rested and put to bed - by far... But, this group shouldn't be condemned for their thoughts and stances on life - should they? I mean, it's not like I""m going to be best friends with a Cashier in my future... Or attend their church services ever?

So, more internal dialogue, I have come to a conclusion. I want their chicken and sauces. And Fries. I feel dirty sliding into the drive-thru, but still proceed. The chicken w/sauces and fries were outstanding. Did they change me and/or my core? Hell no. Am I going to visit them frequently? Noo... Once in awhile? Sure, why not. I know what I believe it - period. Just give me your chicken and that's were it all ends. Period.",2016-01-20 22:52:08

The decor and design of the place is pleasant. It gives a more modern and clean look than the surrounding Chinese restaurants.

This place is great to fill the cravings of udon or don for all us uptowners but it's nothing special but they do a decent job at around $11 a bowl

I'm not a fan of udon but I tried some and I really like the texture of their's! My girlfriend is a udon snob and she doesn't think much of their noodle. So if you like authentic udon then maybe this place won't satisfy your needs. 

Their rice (don) is good! Nicely flavoured and makes a great base for their bowls. I had their chicken teriyaki and unagi. Both great bowls with good flavour!

We had their green milk tea and taro milk tea. Too sugary in our opinion. The taro was very taroy though! Great job on that but we wouldn't get the green milk tea again.

In that review, I said: Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill is like the Chipotle's for the Gryos and hummus crowd. It's actually more of a fast food version of Pita Jungle. The food is really good and fresh!  Lunch ran us under $20  and we left very impressed.""

I've included that portion of my review, because in many ways nothing has changed, except for the name. Even the interior is identical. 

Whether it's called Olives Mediterranean Grill, or Garbanzos, the food is still very good.  The one major improvement is the quantity of food they provide, which is generous. Another, is the addition of pizza, or Focaccias. Nice. 

Entrées are in the $10 to $14 range.  Our bill came to $44.99 for three, including tax and after a 10% discount.

Nearly two years later, we returned for trivia night and it was a much better experience. Bordering on 4 stars, but not quite. 

We arrived around 6:30 for trivia that starts at 7. One of the great things about this place, unlike other places in town that host trivia is that they allow you reserve tables. That's awesome. Service was incredibly slow as trivia got underway. Understandable since they were pretty busy, but honestly, if the restaurant knows they get busier on these days they need to staff accordingly. We decided to share some Nachos Florentine and they were so much better than our previous visit to Nacho Daddy. I was pleasantly surprised. The flavors were nice, but I still wish they would spread out the toppings better so that you're not left with tons of plain chips on the bottom of the stack. I appreciate all the different nacho offerings. They are quite creative.

There's nothing more rewarding than picking your own vegetables. First off I must say, those apple donuts are amazing!!! My man and I split an order, but we could have easily finished off a second batch. They were so fresh, warm, soft, not too sweet with a rich apple flavor. So good! Next we hit up the vegetable fields. We scored big on a full bag of kale, carrots and sweet potatoes. And all of it for only $4!!!!!!! Score!!!!! They also had eggplants, zucchinis, spinach and pumpkins. We enjoyed walking through the orchard and just looking at everything. It's funny though because as we were picking the vegetables, we felt badly for killing the plants, but hey, we do have to eat. My only dislike was that a lot of the plants were really picked over and the sun was beaming down, which would be fine if I wasn't sick. 

Overall, I had an amazing time and I can't wait to taste all the delicious vegetables we picked. It's really far from where we live, but the apple donuts alone are worth the trip.

~Fud/Drink~
I have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.

~Atmosphere/Service~
The Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.

~Extras/Rating~

Regarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here. 

 No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water. The only thing I hate about this place, is that I didn't think of it first.. :) 5 stars because they deserve it, enough said.",2013-02-04 19:50:03

It was not full and seemed pretty cool, so we made a mental note that if Santouka had a wait we will come here instead, or try it out another time. As it turned out there was a substantial line outside Santouka, so we said fudge it and doubled back to Raijin. 

The place is brightly lit and is more spacious than other ramen places I have been to like Kinton and  Sansotei. They were adequately staffed and the staff was friendly. They have a small menu, consisting of 6 different ramens; 3 pork types and 3 chicken types and gyozas. 

We tried the Tonkasu Shio and Tonkasu Miso ramen. Both were pretty good but we both preferred the Shio ramen since the Miso was a bit overpowering. The Shio broth was flavorful, loved the black oil they added to it, the egg was nicely cooked and the noodles were slightly chewy and not soggy (I like it like that, nothing worse than soggy noodles), the pork was tender, it also came with a bit of napa cabbage, black fungus and canola flower vegetable. The Miso ramen came with the same things as the Shio except it had no egg and had corn and bean sprouts instead. The broth was thicker than the Shio broth and a bit one note, it was over powered by the Miso, it was still tasty but not a favorite. The portions were decent, we were both comfortably full after our meal but not stuffed to the gills.

We will definitely return when we crave ramen, My husband and I like here more than Kinton and Sansotei because we aren't bumping into people or waiting in a cold line to get some food...yet (there will probably be a line once this place gets popular, today was their opening day).",2012-11-15 01:26:12

The ribs were as meaty as any I've ever had, and tender.  Not fall-off-the-bone tender, but soft, flavorful, and not dried out.

Although this place has been opened for more than half a year, it has gotten quite a bit of hype recently as being one of the best burgers in Toronto and what seems to be the closest experience to Shake Shack/In & Out. After my visit this past weekend, I can definitely say that it was pretty much the best burger that I have had. Yes, better than Burgers Priest, In & Out and Shake Shack!

Everything from their Rudy sauce, melted cheese to their super juicy beef patty - all complimented very well together into one cohesive flavour bomb in your mouth. I also liked the fact that it came out piping hot. 

The only thing that I could see an improvement on is the bun itself as it is quite soft - so given the explosive juices from the beef patty, it was quite a challenge to contain everything into the burger. To minimize leakage, pick up the burger and flip it upside down before taking a bite.

Will definitely be back here again whenever I have craving for burgers.",2017-03-20 03:44:45

It's obvious they're fairly new as they struggled to process my order and seemed a bit lost even with their own menu. The majority of the workers are young girls, so don't expect much in relation to customer service. The concept of watching them make fresh doughnuts is very cool, but I was not impressed with the taste. 

 It's not really a doughnut, more like a pound cake. They all taste the same even with all the toppings and coatings you can choose from. You won't find any glaze doughnuts here which was disappointing. The doughnut craze is huge in South Florida and North Carolina is way behind!",2017-09-03 23:05:20

She thoroughly went through the drawers and found some. There were lots of some colors but none of them were on the shelf.

As you enter the main double-doors you are stepping back in time - yet this theater was restored with the forethought of bringing its use into the current century and the latest technologies. None of that is visible until you feel the sound and the lighting of a production. yes, you can feel it.

He would not give out any corporate or his management information so we called the Durango location and guess what? That manager said he couldn't help us right now! What kind of people work here? Obviously ones who can give two damns about paying customers who bring up valid points about false advertising on their own website. How can a manager not know what is on their online menu?

I've been wanting to go to Bellwoods since a friend of mine gave me a 4-pack of beers as a reward for bringing their guitar amp to them. They make fantastic beers, creative and delicious. Not stuff you will regularly find in the LCBO -- you have to come here to get them.

Located in a super hipstery park of the Bellwoods, we set up a dinner with a friend, and got here about half an hour before they opened for a dinner.

This was a very sensible choice, as this place get a LINE. We lucked out and were first, I saw the queue behind us wandering off into the distance. We were a tiny bit worried they wouldn't seat us without our entire party there (our friend is chronically late) but once they opened, they were cool, they sat us at one of their larger communal tables.

We ordered a couple of beers and waited for our friend, who arrived shortly thereafter.

As I said, the beer is worthy of 5 stars. They do a lot of ""funky,"" small-batch type of stuff, a lot of unusual beer styles (although goses and sours aren't that weird anymore.) 

The food is also excellent .... but the quantity is a little small. It's small plates style food, and we ordered the following for three people:

Bread with garlic scape butter
Ryeberry Salad
Olives
Cheese Board
Meatballs

All of it was delicious, but I think for us, we were fearing we were going to run up a prohibitively high bill at the rate we were going, us being a trio of hungry people. So we decided to stop while we were ahead. We had no problems with the service, the staff were really friendly and helpful with suggestions, bringing out tasters if we wanted them before trying a full draught of beer.

Don't get me wrong at all, this is a really great place. However, if you're looking for a substantial dinner, you might be disappointed. I'd definitely come here again for a beer and some nibbles, and of course to pick up more beer.",2017-07-24 16:31:53

The Nigiri was nothing to brag about, the servings were ok, but I found myself needing to add condiments for flavor.  The shrimp on the regular menu was dry and flavorless.  I also ordered the sweet shrimp, you can only do this once and with the dinner meal, they did not taste that fresh and were a bit sticky.

That's my other pet peeve about this place, there are only two dinner only items, sweet shrimp and sea urchin, and you can only order one.  If you don't like these two items and order them, then the dinner menu price  is not worth it,

There is one saving item on this menu, and this is the spicy seafood udon.  That was the most delicious item that I have had at this place and may come back again for it, but not for the AYCE.",2014-06-16 00:24:29

I have read mostly great reviews on this place, and finally decided to give it a try yesterday (Sunday) late lunch/brunch. I made a RSVP on OpenTable (not because it's needed, since it was 2:30pm and virtually empty) which rewarded 100 points (if that's your thing). 

1st impression: nice interior, very romantic chic with the white on white & dark wood floors look.

We're sat immediately at a 4-top. Nice touch on the black napkin (all restaurants should use black napkins in my opinion). On Sundays they have the regular lunch menu and the brunch menu. My eyes went straight to the pan seared sea scallops with risotto ($16).

Waiter came and greeted us. While he was very efficient and did a good job in general, he's a little ""rough on the edges"" for this place. Example 1: I asked for water. He walked away and 3 steps later he turned around and loudly asked ""you want lemon?"" I don't need lemon for my water, but he could have easily brought over water and provide a small dish of lemon wedges if he wasn't sure. It beats yelling back at me 3 big steps away. Example 2: I inquired about the portion of the sea scallops. He didn't know. But instead of saying ""I'm sorry ma'am, I don't know but let me find out"" and actually go and find out, waiter looked at me and said ""well, I don't know, I don't normally do brunch shift."" And by ""let me go find out,"" he meant walked 4 steps over toward the hostess station and loudly asked the waiter that's standing across the half wall. Eventually he walked to the kitchen. Well, why didn't he just do that to begin with? 

Reality is the acoustics in this restaurant is amazingly loud. While there're only 2 other tables and a few patrons by the bar, it seems awfully ear piercing. I don't want to know how loud it can get when there's a full house.

My scallop dish came with 3 large sea scallops cooked perfectly in texture (as in a little rare in the middle) but I think the char on the cooking pan wasn't cleaned out first, because it had a slight burnt taste to it. The risotto tasted good but a little undercooked for my liking. But the portion was good, and it made great leftovers. For the price I think it's a great deal.

The pizza are $12 and was ok in size. Thin crust may be a better way to go ($11 instead) because the crust was a little on the doughy side.

All in all I think the place has good potential. The side dining room can make a great private dining area. The ambience was good if not a little on the loud side. I probably will stick with the lunch/brunch visit for value reason. I will definitely want to try the seafood soup next time.

My girlfriend and I dined there last week before going to the 7 pm showing of ""O"", and as a result, had to choose between the pre theater and prix fixe menu. Girlfriend liked the pre theater options better, so we decided and off to the races!

To start we had a Myvegas credit for the house champagne, which was delightful and crisp with the appetizers. I got the foie gras, my girlfriend the English pea risotto. While the risotto was creamy, decadent, and delicious, the foie gras stole the show. They used a brandy made from Normandy, France, that really brought the dish around. Every bite was spectacular, and I could easily have done several courses on this alone.

For main dishes we did the beef tenderloin and Chilean sea bass. The sea bass was wrapped in a crisp potato layer that was just the right texture and consistency to not overpower the fish. The beef was simply the best non-wagyu cut of meat I've ever had. (My girlfriend let me try hers). Even the potatoes mousseline that accompanied the beef were to die for. We didn't want to be too drowsy for the show, so we skipped wine pairing and had a cocktail with the desserts, which again were almost too pretty to eat! I thought I was going to be all about the chocolate ball, but the strawberry parfait was so refreshing and sweet after all the rich fare that it took top honors for me.

As for service, there's a reason this place has a Michelin star and Forbes 5 Diamond. Old world service, attentive without being intrusive, non judgemental and no attitude about doing the pre theater menu, no attitude about the free credit, and of course beyond knowledgeable about the menu options. Our table was lead by Daniel, along with a host of servers refilling water, wiping away crumbs, offering more bread, all while feeling invisible, which I found especially impressive given the small size of the restaurant.

We finally made it there yesterday.

The place was clean and the people were friendly.  

The menu is small, but I like that.  Too many options overwhelm me.  Hubby and I both ordered the meal that came with 4 chicken strips, fries, toast and coleslaw.  Our kids got the kids meal.  

We paid nearly $28. This is more than I had expected, and more than I'd care to pay in the future.  For fast food, this is outrageous.  

The chicken was good.  Not too flavorful, but the breading was perfect, not too much.  The fries were soggy and under done.  I could do better at home in my home fryer.  The toast was, well, toast.  Nothing special there.  And the coleslaw was same as store bought, I'd had better.  The ""famed"" Cane Sauce was ok.  It didn't blow my mind and it wasn't gross.  Ketchup was available, which was good since my kids thought the Cane sauce was ""weird"".  Ranch would have been more their taste.

BpWxF7B9h7yGWv7DPfMocA,RaNkWBMywhBqCZOQWSN_SQ,jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg,4,10,5,7,"Not a bad little place. Claims to be a gourmet ""takeout"" but there are a few tables inside and out that you can sit at, despite the fact that the entire shop is roughly the size of my master bedroom's crapper. I got their menu and will scan and post it when I get around to it. Since I was the designated food bringer-homer, I ordered a lamb panini for myself and a flank steak panini for my wife, along with an order of blueberry bread pudding and mille feuille, which the lady informed me meant ""a thousand layers"", confirming what I already knew from high-school French. The paninis came in boxes which also contained a reasonably boring salad spruced up with a fairly tasty balsamic dressing and candied pecans - the first time I believe I've ever had those. They added a little something that improved the taste further.

The panini was delicious; the lamb part of it, anyway. It's real hard to get good lamb in this city, especially lamb that tasted this good. I'm dead sick of typical lamb dishes in the US where everyone seems to think that you cannot prepare lamb without rosemary (==FALSE). The sweet onions with it were perfect. I didn't like the crusty bread that it was on - maybe that's the standard for a panini but I'd have preferred something that didn't rip the roof of my mouth wide open.

Two minor issues with this place. Firstly, it's too expensive. The paninis at $10 each are right at the upper limit of what I'd pay for what I got. Other dishes, like the fish and chips, are exorbitantly priced - would you pay $16 for F&C? There's another steak dish they have for $23 which is probably the filet with carrot butter (the menu's downstairs or I'd check again) - get serious, this place is a tiny hole in the wall and I'd expect nothing over $12, even if the chef DID have a French accent. And even if they DO mix carrots with butter.

Second thing. That kid that blows raspberries and mutters ""chocolate"" into her dad's armpit or whatever was there again. This time Grandpa brought her in. She ran around for a bit, then she sat down and her mum (behind the counter) brought her out some hummus to eat (?!), all the time giggling about how the little girl was wearing her ""pirate shoes"" or something. Okay. This is a take-out shop, not Disneyland. If I want family-style hijinks I'll go to Chucky Cheese, not what I thought was a gourmet French place. Kiddy stay home when mummy and daddy worky; customer eat and leave happy. I'm not one of those people that smiles beatifically when young kids caper about and drool over candy. Unless it's my kid. You can imagine what Halloween is like at my house. Fortunately I only spent a short time in there while waiting for my food to be prepared.

Four stars this time purely on the strength of the lamb panini and the fact that the counter gal was nice enough to give me a cold glass of water while I waited. The desserts are still in my fridge from when I went there yesterday and I'll probably eat one or both of them tomorrow, since we already had an early dessert from Ritters this afternoon. *8-) I don't think they'll change my rating either way, though.",2008-06-15 02:28:33

Although they ran out of tapioca at the time which was disappointing. My friend ordered the mango slush which was also very good. Not too sweet and tasted like real mangos.

I was definitely excited to try this place out ever since I saw this place on Vegas Eater. There are multiple ramen shops all over Vegas, but there are no udon places other than Japanese restaurants that serve udon as well as other delicacies. Since it was open on Christmas day, my family and I decided to try this place.

When we got there at 11:35AM, the restaurant was already filled with people even though it just opened 5 minutes later. I am not sure if it is due to its popularity or how it was open on Christmas day, but you should definitely prepare to wait for both your seating arrangements as well as your food. 

After our orders were taken, it took around 30-40 minutes for our meals to be prepared. I understand that the restaurant was filled, and there were a lot of other people's orders to be taken, but I did not like how our meals were given at different times instead of all at the same time, which explains why I took one star off. 

However, I give four stars from my review for the food! The food was delicious, and I am definitely coming back to try their other dishes. I tried their miso carbonara, which is their most popular dish. It was really creamy, and the portion size was just right. I want to try their udon soup dishes the next time I visit.

Talk about starting off food tour with bang!! I have had this place on my radar for some time just never gotten around too trying it. Thankfully my cousins come too Vegas couple times year on the same page comes too food and enjoy checking out new places in Vegas. Shout out Lori I, Tracy H. Hanwook H, Mike M, and Carol M. 

The whole concept of fresh noodles in ramen or any noodle dish. Hell yay! I was excited about checking out Shang Artisan Noodles. I was not disappointed. The freshness of the noodles can tell not only from the obvious watching the guys in the kitchen (open kitchen) prep them, just looking at them look mouth watering, and once dig in so so SO good. It was our first time. So did our Yelp duties order ton of food for two. We started with the beef pancake and spicy wonton. The beef pancake was pretty solid. I really enjoy the meat filling inside had great flavor and seasoning, The dipping sauce was the perfect compliment to the dish. The spicy wonton. I just thought was ok. It lacked any kind of distinct flavor in my mind. Not even spicy. I would not order it again put it that way.

Our entrees my cousin and I made sure tried both kinds of noodles. I got the hand pulled noodles with my Shang Beef Noodle, my cousin got the knife cut noodle with the Chicken and Mushroom Noodle, and then we shared Shang Fried Rice. I love all three dishes!! I know this will be weird but the Shang Fried Rice stood out the most. It was really filling fried rice. It was hardy with lots of vegetables and bunch of stuff. The seasoning on it was very very tasty and could taste it. The worst is having fried rice bland or nothing in it then just rice. The Shang Fried Rice and am sure any of the other Fried Rices. Winnah! The noodles were just as strong between the knife cut and hand pulled. NO way could go wrong with either one. The Shang Beef Noodle had nice portion of cubes of short rib (maybe not sure) that moist and melted in your mouth. The broth was delicious. The bok choy was cooked perfect. The perfect bowl of hearty, hot, and tasty noodle soup warm ones soul. The same can be said of the Chicken and Mushroom. My cousin let me try some. It not as brothy but the sauce was amazing with the chicken and mushrooms. Bok choy. 

The service was five star. The guy was very attentive, friendly, and gave us great recommendations since we were first timers. The interior really like it. It well lit. Open kitchen with bar area so if want watch the guys working them fresh noodles and some entertainment. The spot. It feel modern. The menu is nice simple straight forward.

When looking for something on the lighter side, Crisp remains an excellent option.

The new location sports the same modern feel with muted tones of green and brown throughout the space, along with wooden vine accents neatly tucked into a few places.  As with the original, you walk in the door here and go right to the counter to order, where you can watch your salad come together in less than two minutes.  Specials of the day are prominently posted and many are worth a try.  For orders that require a bout more prep, servers will bring your order to your table.  Servers will also clear your table for you once you leave.  Tipping is actively encouraged, though you will still need to get your own drink and refills.

Prices here appear unchanged, and remain just a tad high, in my opinion, for what you get.  Still, there is no arguing with the freshness and emphasis on quality vegetables, fruits and nuts to enhance the dish.  Certainly makes the burrito and burger shops look like that fat slob of a cousin you only claim on holidays.

My order was ready pretty quickly and was hot and fresh. The beef patty was fresh and quite crumbly, like it is with homemade hamburgers. The flavours were good although after one bite the bun became quite soggy with juices from the meat. There was nothing special or unique in terms of flavour or presentation, but nothing wrong either.

Overall a pretty decent burger, but nothing better than what you could make at home. $6.50 is a little steep in my books, considering there are other burger restaurants in Toronto (P&L, Burger's Priest) that have similar prices but far better burgers.

The naan is good but mine was kind of undercooked, leaving some bites overly chewy.

The toppings don't all fuse together that well, leaving much of them to drop out of the bread.  I wasn't given a fork and was left scrambling for beans.

I welcome Short Leash and wish them well, but don't go thinking it's going to revolutionize hot dogs, it's just a good dog.  Worth $5?  Maybe if the dogs were a bit bigger.",2010-12-13 19:01:20
SyGeRi2uDx_AOtI_BnY7dg,CYTpi63Tv_UTjsaTMCZUvg,ejaUQ1hYo7Q7xCL1HdPINw,4,1,0,0,"I actually have Catholic guilt for not reviewing Church Brew Works until now as I've been here countless times over the years.  And Catholic guilt is appropriate for this venue as, obviously, ""Church"" Brew Works is located in a very old Catholic Church.  

When you walk in if you're Catholic, by habit, you'll want to dip your hands into the Holy Water holder that is sans Holy Water.  But your eyes will immediately go to the old altar that now holds large vessels that are brewing and fermenting some pretty great beer.  That being said, be aware that you're going to smell some pretty strong malty-sweet aromas from the brewing.  On my most recent visit it was stronger than I would have preferred.  But no fear, we were able to sit outside, which is like transforming yourself into a scene from Harvard in the late 1800's.  The little courtyard patio outside is two levels surrounded by brick walls covered in ivy.  You can sit with a small group or bring all your friends and grab the picnic table with the long bench.  Either scenario is going to be great.

Onto the food.  Oh how I love the menu here.  I always want to go for the wood fired pizzas because they rock - and there are so many culinary treats to choose from like pierogie pizza or chicken and pineapple or wild boar BBQ.  That's right, I said Wild Boar and I'm not lying.  Amazing thin crust wood fired to perfection.  

The menu typically has a salmon or some sort of fish but what you can always count on is a delicious pierogie option.  You're in Pittsburgh and Church Brew Works does their pierogies right.  On my most recent visit I had buffalo chicken pierogies and truth be told (we were in church so I cannot tell a lie) there wasn't a crumb left on my plate.  

If you have friends in town visiting Pittsburgh for the first time or the tenth impress them by taking them to Church Brew Works.  Because I guarantee that they'll go back to their hometown and will tell all their friends about this awesome treasure.  Amen.",2015-08-03 13:27:02

I must have driven by Frashers at least a thousand times over the past 7 years that I've been in AZ.  Never once felt compelled to go in and check it out.

Then over the holidays earlier in the year, my brother and his family came in town to visit me from NYC.  To put it simply, they are VERY hard to impress or even please for that matter.  I love them to pieces but they are the epitome of the Park Avenue princesses who find flaws with everything!!  The Phoenician and Mary Elaines (back when it was still there) were incredibly ""sub par.""  I took them to Mastros and they acted like I was trying to poison them.

Then, believe it or not, after taking a suggestion from someone who worked at the hotel, we wound up at Frashers.  I assumed we were doomed from the second we walked in the door.  The interior?  Very understated and even had a bit of a bar crowd for the last few minutes of happy hour.  Not a good start for the upper east siders...

Then my brother opens the wine list, sees a bottle of Silver Oak he usually pays around $200 for in the city selling for $70, and decides to give it a shot.

And thank the lord we did!  That food was incredible!  And I mean everything!  My filet was absolutely divine!  Literally beat the pants off of Mastros at a much lower price.  My brother and his kids could not believe how good their food was either.  It was hilarious.  His wife practically couldn't speak the entire meal.  My nephew ordered some BBQ sampler if memory serves, and he killed the entire thing, saying over and over again how it was the ""best chicken, ribs, steak etc that he had ever had in his entire life!""  Much to his mother's dismay of course : )

Anyways, if you want a ridiculously good meal that will completely catch you off guard, go to Frashers.  Great food and great wine at almost half the price of what comparable places in the valley would run you...what more can you ask for??",2009-01-07 05:18:53

We went to Walmart tonight tired af, needed to get our crap for the kids and go home. But no, thanks to Jason and his plan to screw all the customers over by playing some crazy hide and seek game with the merchandise, it took us like an hour to find only some of the stuff we went there to get. Thanks Jason, it is SO FUN wandering up and down the aisles with two cranky ass kids looking for stuff that used to be there and you can no longer find it.

I always start off with the egg rolls. The egg rolls at Pho Saigon tasted a bit off. I am a creature if habit so the Pho Tai was what I ordered. The broth was ok. The pho overall was nothing special and the noodle to beef ratio was decent. It was really hot in there for being the middle of July. I know who eats hot soup on a hot day, but it was so muggy in there that I was hot before I even got my pho. 

I do have to say they are really efficient and quick at taking your order. After that service ceased to exist. Yes I understand it's not a five star restaurant, but waters were never refilled and no one came back to see if we needed anything else at all like extra napkins.

I really like sushi.  I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.

Upon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened. 

In the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.  

Back to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.

Our waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).  However, some things you can't make up for.  Pure, you left a bad taste in my mouth.",2010-01-21 16:35:09

Prices range from 4.99-5.99 offered 11am-4:30pm (I forget if its only on week days, but I know for sure Holidays are excluded). I really like the beef chow fun and we usually order the salt and pepper pork chops. The chow fun is definitely up to par, but I think other Chinese restaurants wip up a better salt and pepper pork. I think it's probably the batter, which is not as crisp as other places.  When I went a few weeks ago we also ordered the Seafood hot pot, mongolian beef, and fried flounder.  All of it was pretty standard and nothing special, but I guess I shouldn't complain because it could be a lot worse.  The fried flounder's batter could also be a little more crisp.

Someone else got a full rack of ribs that were pretty tender. Side of green beans was also drenched in butter. 
Pro tip - order the salad bar as your second side and that can serve as your appetizer as you can get that first thing. It's a buffet, not extensive options but fresh ingredients and yummy broccoli salad.

My pho had chunks of thickly sliced beef that was still slightly pink, even after the soup had cooled some.  Otherwise, the soup was filling. I throw in all the sides--even the jalapenos (those damn pips can be pretty spicy at times).

I still stand by my former opinion- I personally come for the sushi, not the Korean because I'm pretty much steadfastly loyal to Seoul Garden in Parma for my Korean food, however, I come here at least twice a month for sushi, and I am never disappointed. 

I always sit at the bar, for a few reasons.  One- I don't have to wait to be seated during a busy lunch. Two- I always get a friendly greeting from the sushi chefs when I sit down. Three- for some reason, it seems as if this place has an extremely high turnaround rate for their serving staff. Every time I come in here there are different servers, and they always seem to either be ""in training"" or just really, really confused. For those reasons, I sit at the bar, and I can get in and out during my short lunch hour really quickly. 

By this time, I've probably tried most of the rolls on their menu, and I like all of them. Their best deal however, is probably their lunch combos (sold before 2pm). You get two different kind of rolls, and the price ranges between $8-$10. Most of the time, I leave having spent $10 or less on my sushi, which I think is a really great price for good sushi. 

I'm happy to see this place has a busier lunch crowd now than they did when they first started, but it seems a lot of people I mention it to still don't know about it.

It was graduation weekend and we didn't have reservations which meant an hour wait for the main dining room, or 5-10 minute wait for the patio. Uh, patio please. It was a beautiful night out, and the patio is decorated with lights and has a very nice ambiance. I don't know why others didn't opt for the patio, since the main dining room seemed a madhouse with all the graduates and their families. 

In the 5 minutes we were waiting, we ordered cocktails. Since we were seated so quickly, the bartender found us at our table and transferred our bar tab. Now, I love single malt scotch and I love a well made single malt scotch cocktail - one that enhances the flavors of the scotch rather than mask it. And the Tornado Steak House had a cocktail that uses one of my favorite single malts (Ardbeg 10 yr). It was amazing. It had all the savory notes of the Ardbeg along with the big smokiness, the citrus notes and tartness. It was amazing and I will definitely come here just for the cocktail. 

I ordered the 16 oz New York strip, and the boyfriend ordered the 28 oz bone in ribeye. All their entrees come with soup/salad and a side. I ordered the French Onion for an extra upcharge and the bf ordered the clam chowder. Both were delicious. The French Onion was rich, slightly sweet, and robust in flavor. The gruyere and french bread complemented the soup rather than smothered the soup as is often the case. The clam chowder is also delicious. It was rich with a delicate briny flavor. The bread is also really tasty. There was a mini loaf of rosemary bread that was crusty with a soft warm center. The breadstick covered with toasted sesame seeds was my favorite. 

Then the entrees came, and man, so much meat. 16 ounces is a lot of meat and it was a thick slab on my plate, but heavenly melt in the mouth salty bites. I got through about a third of the steak and was so stuffed by the end. Definitely doggy bags were needed. 

This place is delicious and amazing and highly highly recommended. Great place for special occasions.",2015-05-18 05:34:11

It is located in a strip mall on Scottsdale Road toward Tempe in a strip mall, as most of the good restaurants in the area are 

Walking in it is a bit confusing as you go through AZ Wine, which is a very large wine store, with a great selection of Sake, Wine, Half Bottles, Craft Beer (Aventinus) so turn to your left and there you will see the dining area, if no one is immediatly there someone will pop up shortly as there are only two people working the front of the house. It is BYOB so you can bring a wine if you would like to or get there a bit early and browse, or bring your own wine and during the meal add something extra if you run out of wine (which we did!)

Now on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu, there were Sweetbreads for the First Course (+5 supp) and there was another option for the second course but I do not recall what it was

Course 1 - I had the Sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious (i cannot remembe what kind, the good kind) with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- I had been to Blackbird (1 star Michelin Chicago) who also served up a sweetbread 1st course, and this preperation blew it out of the water, and that was our favorite app we had there -- Also they gave a very good portion size as well, this was not a Restaurant Week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about RW is that many places don't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck, instead of trying to gain return clients

The Mrs had the Pork Belly, which I have to say was one of the best pork belly's i have had in a very very long time. It seems they are always overcooked and stringy instead of melt in your mouth lucious. The flavoring and cooking of it was perfect, again to releate it to Blackbird (because two of the 1st course apps were the same ingredient) Blackbird overcooked theirs and it we left some of it on the plate, I was lucky to get one bite of the Pork Belly from my wife

Our friends we went with, he ordered identical to me, and his wife went with the Gnocchi, she really enjoyed it however I did not try any of it

Course 2 - I had the Smoked Duck Salad, which was not exactly what i was expecting and I was pleasantly suprised. For some reason I expected warm duck, but it was chilled duck with just a light touch of smoke, to set off the flavor against the tangy peaches and sweet corn, it was amazing and way better than what i had pictured in my head - there was also TONS of duck in it, every bite huge piece of duck - just great

The Mrs had the Grilled Romaine with Anchovies, which was also very good, nice anchovies on it and she really liked it, however the duck salad was where it was at - our friends wife went with the off menu salad and she really liked it, I passed on trying it because it wasnt beating the duck salad

Course 3 - 3 of us had the Grilled Pork Porterhouse which was one of the best pork dishes that I have had, the only other one that i would rank up there when they had it on the menu was the Stuffed Pork Chop at Cowboy Ciao (no longer on the menu) this was was equal to it or better, they cooked it pretty close to medium rare which is perfect for me and everything about it was good, lots of flavor - The Mrs had the steak (when Todd was explaining the menu he was very elaborate about everything on the menu and then he was like ""we have steak too"") so that was really on the menu because you have to have a steak on the menu - It wasn't bad but when all the other flavors on every other course is off the charts, just a good steak isnt the same - however as a good husband I gave multiple pieces of the Pork Porterhouse to Mrs Dapuma

I even spied a counter service check out where board games like Scrabble could be rented out! If you venture outside, there's more fun filled adventures waiting for you (like Hopscotch and Giant Beer Pong). There's usually a band playing outside, too.

What I really like about Gold Spike is that there's ample seating available. I'm tired of going into bars/clubs where seating is extremely limited. At Gold Spike, I'm almost guaranteed some sit-down time. I'm also a fan of the wide variety of social activities available to guests. It's pretty hard to get bored here! 

4/5 for the Gold Spike venue/nightlife

Gold Spike is immensely popular with young crowds and especially locals. The vibe here reminds me of bars in Denver. Gold Spike is one of my favorite hangout spots in DTLV.

It;s located next to other Montreal land marks (Olympic Park, BioDome and Botanical Gardens). It's very new, modern and high tech. They have two theatres. One you view the ""sky"" from bean bags on the floor or Muskoka chairs. Here they were showing a about 12 min artistic interpretation of the universe with a great music but there were no words, explanations. We saw this film first and loved the visual and overall experience of it but I was disappointed that there wasn't more information and description even though it was an artistic interpretation - but it was very beautiful. The second film is what I think of as a traditional planetarium. It's a theatre with adjusted chairs that allow you to see the ""sky"". this presentation kind of has two parts. First they show and describe the constellations of the seasonal Montreal night sky and then they go deeper into the far reaches of the universe to show nebulas, galaxies and all the rest. I really, really enjoyed this portion and felt it was very informative and is probably what most people expect/want when they visit a planetarium. They also have an exhibit type area that is very interactive with touch screens, and puzzles and talks from staff. I found this area a bit of a disappointment but also amazing. I felt like it was a bit more about how advanced and 'techie' it was then the information and there were some bugs in some of the touch screens closing things before you had finished reading and the 3 different talks that happened in the 2.5 hours we were there were all in French meaning we didn't participate. I get that they probably need this time of presentation space to draw in young learners but I felt like the science and knowledge wasn't as important in the process. 

Overall I was impressed with the space, the theatres, the exhibit hall and the cafeteria was great. However it seems like they are still going through some growing pains (like lake of signage, non operational exhibits for example).

The portion size is smaller than other places but it was decent. The amount of toppings is again less than other places, but what was there was very delicious. The small charred(?) tomatoes add an extra boost of smokiness. 

I tried the signature clam broth ramen and these are not as rich but even more savory. If I go back again, this would be the one I get. The red spicy tonkotsu had a good kick with what I'm guessing is smoked paprika. We also ordered a plate of gyoza to share ($5 for 5 pcs). They tasted very fresh and had ample pork and chive filling. It was very light; I would've liked it more if it was crispier and if the dipping sauce had a bit more tang to it.

Although the space was quite small, I really appreciated that the tables and bar seating still provided enough space for each person to sit comfortably without feeling crammed like I do at most other ramen places.

Pros:
Approachable, balanced wine list; chef was friendly to suggest pairings and provided another guest with a personalized tasting experience. Owner mentioned beer license pending, plans to offer largely microbrew, craft beer selections.

Interesting, ambitious menu with several different moules preparations, a tempting risotto selection, and brick oven-fired pizzas.

Owners have put in a lot of thought into the European feel - Old World decor, mostly tables for two, couch seating against two walls of the restaurant, gated front patio seating.  

Of note - they offer extensive happy hour and reverse happy hour/late night specials.

Negs:
Service was inexplicably slow despite the restaurant having only a few parties. 

When asked about the unusually high amount of cracked mussels in a dish (~1/3), the server she responded that the chef probably just stirred too hard, which he corrected and pegged the poor quality to their supplier. At any rate, would recommend staying away from moules to avoid a mouthful of shell pieces. The Portugese preparation did not include any chorizo, contrary to the description.

The formal dinner settings were a bit overwhelming for the tiny cafe, which would have made movement impossible if the restaurant was full.

I checked-in here with Yelp so I got the buy one drink get one free deal, that was cool; but the drink I ordered had pineapple juice in it, and I believe it was bad or the cup wasn't clean I don't know which but I swear the drink tasted like ice cold vomit. When we took the drink back to the bartender all she said was oh no the pineapple juice is good, smh it was soooo disgusting.  Where in the hell was John Taffer when I needed him!?!?! I can't believe I even tried to force myself to drink that sh!t. She took our drinks and threw  them out and said if we wanted new drinks we had to pay again,yeah right. Fxck these drinks. The first drink was just ok, and the second round tasted like vomit, umm pass. Probably would have tasted better if I was already drunk, but vomit flavored is very hard to ignore. There were some guys there playing beer pong, and they had the ball flying all over the damn place. A few times the ball was on the floor in the corner where the ""VIP"" couch and main window/wall is, if you look on the ground and see the filth build-up smh, I was thinking these MF'ers are gonna have Hepatitis A by the end of the night. Beer or alcohol doesn't kill everything, but good luck guys! What I was really surprised about was the music though. With the name of it being PBR Rockbar I expected to hear mostly Country or Rock, but they had a mix of Hip-Hop playing, old Hip-Hop but still. Anyway this wasn't a great experience for me and I don't feel like this is my type of bar anyway, so more than likely I would personally not come back here to spend money.",2015-10-11 16:00:48

It's so tucked away, I doubt I would see or know about it just driving by. Even as I walked up to the main entrance, it seemed like a total hole-in-the-wall but I was surprised to find a packed restaurant in a moderate space with an old school setup. 

They weren't serving the duck that night but we had called a day earlier to reserve two of their signature dishes which was the Winter Melon Soup and the Chicken Stuffed with Sticky Rice. Along with that, we ordered an Assorted Seafood Birdnest, Snow Pea Leaves with King Mushrooms and a Steamed Fish.

It was the perfect amount of food for 4 people and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. Their signature dishes definitely did not disappoint. The Winter Melon Soup ($30) will warm you right up on a cold day. Very savory with generous amounts of seafood, lotus, wintermelon, etc. given! The Chicken Stuffed with Sticky Rice is another item not to be missed. Although not cheap ($42), it was quite worth it. Chicken skin was crispy, meat wasn't dry and the sticky rice was moist but not super oily. This dish is exclusive to Maple Yip as I don't think I've come across any other Chinese restaurants offering this. 

The seafood basket is a good choice because it gives the table a little more variety and the taro bird nest is delicious. They didn't go overboard with the sauce which allowed the nest to stay crispy 'til the very end. Points for unsogginess! As for the steamed fish ($35), everyone agreed that the flavors were all on point and perfectly cooked. Our server brought out the fish to show that it was freshly ""caught"" prior to bringing it into the kitchen. Again, not exactly cheap but the fish was a lot bigger and meatier than we had expected. Our vegetable dish (snow pea leaves with king mushrooms) was tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. 

I recommend coming here with someone who speaks Cantonese for easier communication and even better, someone who can read Chinese because most of their specials are written on the walls. 

Service was great, everyone was pleasant and helpful. 

Our bill came out to $160 before tip but if you take into consideration the items that we ordered (which were pretty much some of the most expensive ones), it's reasonable.

Amidst the clanging machines and the NASCAR fans late night whoop whoops in the casino, the bang-bang of the machine guns was a welcome respite! Seriously, the Mob Museum has so much to offer to the most enamored and infatuated mafia wanna-bes (it's romantic) and to those who have a genuine thirst for knowledge and history.

There are so many different types of media to view, old newspaper clippings, mob memorabilia, FBI files, films on ""hits"", ""Hollywood"", old Vegas, senate hearings, and interactive exhibits. 

You start on the top floor in a ""line up"" where the museum page will take a picture of you along side four others. As you wind through the top floor maze, there is so much to read about the history of the mob (throughout the world and Vegas). It gets a little dizzying and the information is overwhelming. I just started scanning everything, then went to picking and choosing the parts that interested me the most. Had I stayed and read each little piece (and I am a fast reader), I doubt we would have left before the building closed for the evening (and we arrived at 10:30 am).  

The second floor houses a courtroom that presented Senate hearings. Not only interesting, but it provided the ability to sit a spell after standing throughout most of the top floor. The second floor continues the story of the mob ""connections"" and the individual infamous mobsters. By the time you get to the first and last floor, you pretty much know what happened to all of them, and the status of the ""mob"" in today's world.  

We took about three hours to see everything, which included watching all the films and listening to most of the information displays, playing with the machine gun, the interactive ""shooting the bad guy"" exhibit, and a quick tour through the gift shop.

This place seems to want to nickel & dime you for the basic cleaning needs.  They provide a dust pan in your room but no broom????  One roll of paper towels nothing more???

If you want pasta you better bring your own pasta strainer because you don't have one.  It's kind of like moving into a new place and having to bring your own everything.  Fortunately there is an AMAZING Smith's grocery not too far where you can get everything you need.

The beds are like clouds, the tub is a Jacuzzi tub, and the place is very comfortable.  You can even open the windows to get some fresh air into the room which is unusual for a place in Vegas with tall towers.  Of course if you are not on the fist floor the window may not open far enough to put a hand through it but I guess they feel people would be tempted to take a plunge if it opened more...

That was strange but anyway, overall if you can avoid the sharks trying to catch you to go on a tour or give you a pitch for an upgrade, you will be fine.  Don't fall for the parking pass, it is a trick to get you to go on a tour, unless you enjoy playing with the sales people, don't get suckered in.

The place is clean, well maintained but gets very crowded.  You do have the South Point next door which is ok and provides lots of entertainment but other then that you are isolated from the rest of the strip unless you take the bus or a cab.  A lot of the property that was supposed to be developed around is still dirt, the economy took care of that and the water park which was supposed to be close by, well one opened up on the Southwest side of town maybe a 10 minute drive and the other in Henderson maybe a 15 minute drive.

An hour before closing we were almost the only customers there, and five minutes later, we were just that.  Our waiter, Pablo, was friendly and attentive, but a little bit absent-minded.  

My margarita was filled almost to overflowing, and that one drink was enough to keep me worried on the drive home.  Granted, I have a very limited capacity for alcohol, but this one was a heavy hitter.  Maybe it's just me, vertically-challenged as I am.  

We both ordered chicken:  Pollo Asado for me and Carnitas de Pollo for Herb.  We also ordered a dinner salad to share, but that never arrived.  I was afraid that the very thin slices of chicken in my dish would render them tough and dry, but they were moist and obviously well-marinated.  Very tasty.  I didn't try Herb's Carnitas, but he said they were good.  But the guacamole that was supposed to be added to both dishes was one lonely teaspoonful on mine, and completely absent on his.  The waiter obligingly brought us a small dish of the stuff, and it was quite unlike any other guacamole we've ever had:  some light-colored binder was holding the avocado together.  It wasn't mayo.  It wasn't sour cream.  It was unidentifiable (and I didn't ask).  It did nothing to enhance the very bland avocado creation I normally adore.

Normally I leave a Mexican joint with enough food to have a second meal.  Not in this case.  I cried uncle at the very last small piece of chicken.  It wasn't enough for a carry-out box, but luckily the Herb I'm married to often has the surname Hoover, so he sucked it up.

Our son had the kid's steak kebobs (chargrilled and sumptious) and we split the night's special- the braised lamb over greek spaghetti.

I had the #21 - the most expensive rice plate - and while the price did seem a tad high (especially considering Vietnamese food is usually very reasonably priced) it was absolutely delicious.

I recently frequented another Vietnamese place in Tempe, and their broken rice does not compare to Com Tam Thuan Kieu's at all.

I would absolutely love to come back, but the only thing stopping me is that #21 is kind of expensive for my frugal self. If they had a lunch special, I would definitely become a regular.

We tried the whole fish ceviche, the octopus, the agnolotti, and the crab cake poppers. The whole fish ceviche was great-- a little spicy, a little sweet, and a little tart. The octopus was excellent too. The agnolotti with butternut squash had a nice touch of sweetness and the pasta was perfectly al dente. Finally, the crab cake popper was a nice twist on a crab cake. 

We also tried the espresso pudding and it was excellent. I usually don't like pudding but I found myself really liking this one! As for drinks, we tried the French press without realizing it was $14, so probably wouldn't order that one again.

Start out with picking your protein. I chose the lamb in a burrito with a mild spice. Still a little spicy for me it was very enjoyable having the Indian flavors in a burrito.

Friday night dinner. 9pm. Group of 5. Spent almost 2 and a half hours there, entirely waiting for food. Went as a suggestion from a friend, because it was the only Thai joint around with extended hours, (until 3am I believe). Decor was tacky, unnecessarily dimly lit and noticed there was stage with a DJ booth and microphone for karaoke. There were about 4 other tables being served, with about 2 waiters total. 

Wasn't pleasantly greeted by our waiter, instead literally pointed to our table and simply asked ""Drink?"". Then, took about 15 minutes to come back with our beverages, and another 5 after that to take our food orders. After anxiously waiting for a ridiculous 45 minutes with no food, dishes finally started to come out. Or shall I say one dish. Starving, our entire group scoffed it down, but was left extremely agitated due to its painfully stingy portions. This exact thing happened every 10 minutes per dish, coming out one by one, often bland and unexciting. It also didn't help that our waiter never seemed to care, even as we deliberately showed signs that we were impatient and unstatisfied. Not a single word, apology or update on the speed of the food. Even a ""We're understaffed"" or ""New cook"" would have helped, but now I refuse to even give them the benefit of the doubt. At the end of our long, painful, 2 hour ""sampling"" dining experience, the waiter simply dropped off the check and vanished. I usually am very reserved and understanding, but never before have I had such a bad dining experience in my life.",2010-01-27 22:17:16

The place has a rockin chips & salsa bar. We start out our Mexi-break-feast by piling up some regular tortilla chips along with some tostada chips in a bowl. For dippin, they've got a red hot sauce, a traditional red salsa with tomato, onions, cilantro, peppers, etc and they also now have a creamy, spicy guaca-salsa, which is delicious!

Their coffee is unique and very good. It is a cinnamon spiced blend, which complements their food very well.

They have many Mexican breakfast items that you would expect, and some that you might not. One of our favorites is the breakfast quesadilla, which is pretty large & perfect for splitting with someone else. This tasty dish includes eggs, cheese, green chiles & some other stuff.

Their hashbrowns are delish and come with green chiles and cheese on top. Order a side of those to complement your meal.

The only reason I didn't give Sylvia's 5/5 is due to their service, which can sometimes be lame. Everything is ordered at the counter (no waiter/waitress) and sometimes there is no one to be found when you need something else. They can also be a pain to deal with if they mess up your order. Today we ordered a side of guacamole & we specifically asked for it on the side. Instead, they put a small amount of guac inside our breakfast quesadilla. When I tried to get a side after the fact due to their screwup, they gave me some flack. Try to improve your customer service a bit Sylvia's.",2009-06-27 18:58:07

I was pleased to see some improvements to the food--it seems like the brats fill up most of the bun now compared to what I've seen in the past, and I also think it was a great idea to convert the vegan brat to a burger, since the mashed consistency lends itself better to a burger than a brat.

There are also a few more things on the menu the usual AYCE sushi places don't have with this restaurant being a japanese/korean fushion style i.e. korean cooked beef.

The service was fast, the food was delicious, since we sat at the sushi bar, we actually got to meet the owner, and he comped us a few items that was not on the menu (scores!), for example the hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail)

Here's the list of things we devoured (from what i can still remember):
Edomame - served warmed and salted, very good!
Seaweed Salad - delish strings of seaweed seasoned just right
Lettus Wrap - pieces of tuna sashimi, seasoned imitaton crab, avocado slices, cucmber and carrot strips all wrapped up in a lettus cup, so refreshing, kinda like a california roll minus the rice!
Tuna Poke - good size chunks of tuna sashimi dressed in sauce and served on a bed of seaweed salad, very fresh and refreshing
Mixed Tempura - hot off the frier mix of tempura with 3 or 4 shrimps, squid rings and legs, and a good mix of tempura vegitables
Grilled Hamachi Kama - large piece of bone-in yellow tail chin grilled to perfect yumminess, mmm mmm
Hamachi Nigiri - pretty standard, nothing worth mentioning
OMG Roll - your basic california roll topped with chunks of salmon and tuna sashimi dressed in creamy saunce mixed with fish roe, thumbs up!
Beef Skewer - juicy tender beef
Bacon wrapped shrimp skewer - charred shrimps and bacon, great flavor
Spicy Rice cake skewer - sweet, spicy, crispy, chewy, YUM
Mushroom skewer - mushroom cooked to juicy perfection
Oyster on half shell - i didn't have any but my friend said its fresh

they have so much more on the menu, i encourage everyone to check it out!",2011-08-15 17:38:43

How'd they squish such a hefty menu into such a small kitchen? Ye be warned: It might take you some time to digest the choice. Never have I been so conflicted between two different cuisines. In the course of 10 minutes I had changed my mind a number of times, swaying between a burrito and a burger. How is this possible?

The staff here gets it. Our server saw the look of decision-making fear in our eyes and guided us through some of her favourites. Finally, I settled in with a Utopia Burger, which includes the works, grilled veggies, mushrooms, onions, 3 kinds of cheese, and of course, the patty. With all of the choices, I forgot I even had a choice of chicken, beef, lamb, bison or veggie. I was happy with my juicy beef burger. And thank goodness I went bunless, I'm 100% certain this could never be a handheld meal. My fork and knife barely worked through the mountain of toppings and it took me a number of bites before I found my way to the patty. It was dense.

I am somewhat of a sushi expert and I say their sushi was great. From the Dynamite to the Surf and Turf to the Rainbow Roll. It was delicious. And the nigiri pieces were pretty big too. I would definitely come for the sushi and the prices were not bad. Even cheaper than some rolls at other places that weren't so high class.

However, I was disappointed with the fillet mignon. It felt tender but it was a little overcooked. It was more medium than medium rare. It had a dryness to it. And whatever seasoning they had on it, it didn't come out that much. Yeah....

Also tried the salmon and chicken. Decent as well. Well, if you are in the Talking Stick Resort gambling your money away, you might as well spend some of your earnings at this place. Food is decent. Sushi is great. Eat here... then go back to winning some more money. :)",2014-01-27 06:58:43

When the friendly ladies over there told my girlfriend about their original downtown phoenix location, i didn't hear the end of it until we visited. When we drove down there to try it, our minds were blown the second time, even more than they were when we first found this hidden shop at the Biltmore. WOW!

However, the food was a real disappointment. The fried oysters were super fishy and the texture of the actual oysters was almost kinda crumbly. Weird, but I'll let that go because maybe all fried oysters are like that?? I had coleslaw on the side which seemed to just be shreds of cabbage with none of the mayonnaise-y sauce. Seriously none and I'm not even a big mayonnaise-y sauce fan. Maybe they made a mistake back in the kitchen when they were mixing up the coleslaw and forgot to put the rest of the ingredients in? Sweet potato fries were decent. My friend got the jambalaya, and it had a weird texture, too. I only had one bite of it, but she didn't have much more.
The prices are another strike - actually they're not bad at all for dinner, but I would have really appreciated a lunch special since we were there for lunch. It came out to over $20 each with our meal, a soda, and tip.

The place is split up with the bar on one side and the restaurant on the other side which was across the patio in a separate building.

With dust and flies outside, they should put a cover on that food as it makes it roadtrip across the backyard. That being said, the pretzel is well priced during Happy Hour (which runs til 6pm) at $3 with a side of cheese dip. cannot be certain, but it seemed the pretzel was warmed in the microwave because it had a more chewy and tough texture and after ten minutes it was too tough to eat.

The deal seemed almost too good to be true as the feast consisted of fried mushroom starter, salad, smoked meat sampler, steak and potatoes, desert and a bottle of wine.

First impression walking in is that the place looks bigger than it is, very casual setting but the theme is a little bit all over the place. They had tv screens and ads promoting happy hour specials, almost like a sports bar, but the night we went, they had a jazz singer and band.
I also don't understand their monkey mascot which is featured on their flyers and painted graffiti-like all over their bathroom doors.

The menu seems almost as scattered. They offer a big assortement of sandwiches and poutines and various meats ranging from kangaroo, boar, bison and beef.

With the set menu we were offered, I was pleased with the smoked meat but severely disappointed with my steak. It was overdone, dry and bland. Being one of their most expensive menu items, I expected more. I had to eat it with ketchup when a good cut of meat should be savory on its own.

For the deal I paid, I can't complain too much since it was only 30$ for 2 people (tips and taxes extra) although it isn't worth any more. 
Brisket seems to be recommended by many tourist guides and websites. I can understand the initital attraction but I also see why they have trouble building return customers.

According to our server, every item on the menu is less than 650 calories. This is great news for those who are health conscious and don't want to sacrifice eating a good meal with a lot of flavour. Four's menu accommodates all diets, including gluten-free, and doesn't compromise on taste. 

Between seven people, each of us ordered something different off the menu. The ones I would recommend, and were delicious according to my coworkers, are the Grilled Beef Tenderloin with beets and sweet potatoes, and the Tiger Shrimp salad with couscous and chickpeas. 

I had the Jail Island Salmon with bok choy, fingerling potatoes, and a mango and lime salsa. The salmon was cooked to medium well, and the salsa, though I would have preferred to have more of, complimented my veggies and fish perfectly. If I could have licked my plate clean I would have, it was so delicious.

Even if you're not the type to have dessert after a meal, you must order their Petit Four desserts! They are incredibly good! They have seven different flavours and are served in oversized shot glasses.

I sampled the tiramisu and double chocolate cream, but I would suggest the lemon meringue. It was so lemony and creamy, and tasted incredibly rich. It also had Rice Crispies sprinkled on top which delighted the 7-year old kid in me.

We were sat by the bar. Kind of dark in this place. Little League World Series was on yet again. These restaurants must know I'm coming or something...I sense a conspiracy.

Will I come back during happy hour one day in the future? Probably, you sure can't beat a 99 cent margarita.

I don't care that this place is called a noodle house, and a magic one at that, get yourself some of those potstickers.  And fried too, none of this boiled business.  Heck, just order that and have that as your meal, they're definitely big enough.

Okay now on to what the name says they're good for, noodles.  The hubby ordered the stir fry beef with spicy XO sauce (#34) with thick noodles and well, to put it simply, he was extremely satisfied with his order.  However, I had a try and though I'm no noodle connoisseur, the noodles were a little tougher than I was expecting, reminding me of undercooked spaghetti.  I'm not sure if this was the correct texture of this noodle, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I did however, really enjoy the spicy XO sauce which definitely gave it a little kick, but nothing too overwhelming which was much appreciated.

My beef stew (#25) with flat noodles, was more of a soup (who would've thought, you know, being a stew and all), and flat noodles were a mistake.  The noodles aren't cut up to fit on your spoon so you're left to fend for yourself against these absurdly long, flat noodles with a pair of chopsticks, and in my case, some feeble chopstick-wielding hands.  I made a mess, with noodles falling back into my bowl of soup ever so often, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  The soup which is broth-ier than pho was delicious - I finished every last drop, and the meat which was so flavorful and soft, was gone seconds after I got my bowl.  Now that's saying something, cause I'm a carbs girl and would go all out for them noodles but, but!  I am really sad to say that in either noodle dish, I felt that there wasn't enough meat.  I probably got 4 slices of beef in mine, and there was probably 5 slices in the hubby's dish.  Otherwise, the portion sizes are substantial, as long as you like noodles.  I mean seriously, if you don't, you shouldn't be here.  Oh well they do sell fried rice, so there's that.",2016-04-16 09:07:46

Most recently I came yesterday (a Monday) and didn't have to wait at all, but the time before that they were busier and we had to wait about half an hour. They have a good selection of regular polishes (which are very well organized) as well as shellac and OPI gel. However, sometimes they are running low on some colours (i.e. last time I was asked to select a different colour because the nail tech didn't think there would be enough to cover all my nails...?) and also the colours on their shellac wheel are kind of faded and not accurate - was surprised when they brought out some of the bottles and the colours were not even close to what I thought I picked! But luckily they were accommodating and let me change my mind a few times.

Both times I came, I got a shellac mani and got a regular pedi as well once. For what I can see, the service is kind of hit or miss. Some of the people there are super friendly, but some of them are definitely more reserved and/or have some attitude. The first time I got a male technician who seemed nice enough, but I think didn't speak much English and was a bit klutzy. The second time I got a girl who seemed very proficient at her job, but gave me some attitude when I asked if she could file my nails shorter after she had finished doing one hand - if she had asked me before she went ahead and did all my nails, I would have put in the request sooner!

That being said, there are definitely a few things I do like especially about Pinky. The services are very thorough, as in, for the pedicure they take the time to scrub and massage your legs, which not all other places do, and which I really really liked. Same with the manicure, I like that they moisturize your arms and hands and massage in the lotion. You also get a back massage, which is pretty cool if you're into that stuff - I do wish they would ask you before they just go ahead and start touching you though.

In terms of the actual mani/pedi, the quality is pretty good, and I didn't have issues with my shellac chipping or anything the first time. It is a bit pricey and unlike some other places they charge tax on top. I don't see this becoming my go-to place, but it's a decent nail salon in downtown Toronto.",2015-07-08 01:01:41

I like Fusion much more than I like Flo's down the street. (Incidentally... Eddie Chan and Flo are ex-spouses). 

Eddie Chan is an old friend, but I will keep my review unbiased.  

The food is good. Although not always consistent. I love the chow fun beef noodles... that's the wide noodles... one of may favs! But recently not as good as it has been. Also.. I am a big fan of their house fried rice dish. But the last order I had it seemed that the dish was lacking flavor, and barely ""fried"" (it was almost white rice). 

This is a place I will give one more shot to get it back up to snuff. Then I will move on to a new haunt.

It was close to 11pm and we'd been driving for what felt like all day. He's not really a fan of trying anything local when we're traveling (much to my disappointment), so IHOP was the way to go (and Denny's for the next four days--yay). 

We stopped in here and it was relatively busy, but this was Vegas and drunk people need to eat.. so it made sense. There was one woman dressed as a waitress with two cooks in view. There was a younger girl there seating people, taking orders, and bringing food. This one turned out to be the waitresses daughter and she'd employed her for the evening to help out. She (the waitress/mom) was very friendly and the food was brought out quickly. 

I'd wanted their Country Omelette but didn't eat meat, so I just wanted cheese, sour cream, and mushrooms. She found a way to ring this up so that it was cheaper and when it came out it was bigger than any omelette I've had at any other IHOP (or other breakfast chain for that matter). I ended up taking the rest of it, along with the pancakes back to the hotel with me.

unA9UPfSYQPtkR3jNqrPsA,p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,7mGZrCzGGjS95SdRtEaGcQ,4,10,4,7,"Upfront.. the owners of Sweet Republic are good friends of me and the Mr.. so its that awkward position that I didn't really think about until now. To Yelp or not to Yelp, that is the question. The thing is you feel you want to give their business 5 stars but perhaps risk your Yelp integrity because they are friends of yours. The cool thing is that they are both Yelpers as well so they understand!! 

Let me tell you.. Sweet Republic is not a chain.. its local, natural and delicious. Last night the Mr and I were so in the mood for ice cream we surprised our friends by just showing up. We hadn't been in the space since it was still under construction but let me say that the store turned out great! A tight and bright modern comfort feeling comes over you as soon as you walk in the door. In fact Bizzare Love Triangle was playing as we walked in.. I used to love that song! We immediately were greeted by 2 beautiful smiling faces.. so add warm to the store as well! 
be sure to look down.. the concrete floors are striking!

Immediately me and the Mr got our game on.. SR offers several varieties of sorbet, ice cream and a small assortment of baked goods.. ALL made on premises! (love locals!) We started with tastings of Lime and Basil sorbet, followed by Pear and Ginger then Coconut.. the coconut sorbet was some of the best Ive tried.. in fact it was the only Ive ever tried. Rich and creamy for sorbet with pieces of shredded coconut.. just wonderful!

We moved onto ice cream.. me and the Mr can be quite gluttonous when something is good.. I think we sampled most of the flavors of ice cream but the shining star was the Salted Carmel!! Seriously good stuff here! You know how some people can compare certain foods with sexual experiences.. this for me was one of them.. creamy, rich, sweet, slightly salty, chewy goodness! If you have anything have this one.. I know it'll be a claim to fame as it's done so well!

SR also makes frozen yogurt. Not the super sweet, super tangy variety you find at the Pinkberry clones but a subtly flavored low sweetness froyo. They even make their own yogurt.. we're talking ground up here kids.. no corners cut! They offer a variety of toppings both for the frozen yogurt and the ice cream.. though because they are as natural as possible you wont find neon colored kid cereal but healthy granola, fruits and sauces. This makes them truly different since they are doing exactly what they believe in. 

Let's not forget the small assortment of baked goods.. we only tried the meringues.. delicious! The cookies and banana bread looked awesome.. next time! In the cold case they also have some pints prepacked as well as a few house made frozen novelties. The brownie cookie ice cream sandwich will be the next thing I try!!

If you like wholesome, natural and yummy this will be a great place to spend some time. They even have free wifi so you can 'chill' for a while!

I hope I did them justice without being overly gushy as well as loyal to my Yelp integrity.",2008-06-03 14:17:31

The Monkfish Piccata was great.  Flavorful and light at the same time.  The Dirty Pasta with Duck I was looking forward to, but found it to be one of the least favorites of the table.  Not that it was bad (nothing was bad here) but just lacked any real flavor or punch.  The flank steak was tough, I know its the cut, but I expected better.  We ordered a few of the things off the specials menu including the fried brussels (which are the same as its sister, Meat and Potatoes) and buffalo style sweet breads, which were yummy.  The two winners of the night were the Pig Candy and surprisingly, the Rice Cakes.  When my Uncle ordered the Rice Cakes, I silently threw a fit.  I just think of bland and blah when I heard Rice Cakes.  Wow, was I wrong.  These ended up being the table surprise.  It was done with a spicy Korean based sauce and they were these little rice pillows that are similar to Gnocchi.  It was seriously like Asian Gnocchi.  Such a great little dish.

Now onto the rest of the experience.  We had a reservation for 7:45.  We arrived promptly and were told that our table was paying and we would be able to be seated shortly.  Well.....we stood there in they busy entry way waiting for our table for 40 minutes!!!  The girls at the hostess stand said the people at that table had paid, but weren't leaving.  I'm sorry, but when there is a restaurant as busy as this, why don't these customers have a little respect for the people waiting for their table!!  Tolga, the owner, realized we were waiting and sent their top bartender over to get us a free drink.  That was a very nice gesture to smooth the situation. We finally were seated and greeted by our server 45 minutes after our reservation.  But that was not the fault of BR.....that was just discourteous diners.

As to the decor, I don't think my aunt liked the dead taxidermy animals on the wall.  It has a rustic yet classy retro feel.  I like it.  My only complaint is the sound.  It was difficult to hear any conversation at the table.  I think they should start limiting the people at the bar, like Tender does.  The bar was so slammed that a group of guys had to stand against the railing of the dining area.  They were being so loud and obnoxious my Uncle almost turned around at one point.  We couldn't hear our own conversation due to these guys.  I'm hoping that after the newness of this place wears off, it will be easier to get in and have a nice meal and drink without wading through a sea of people at the bar and yelling to hear the person next to you.

Ah, remember the days when they had a Hello Kitty mascot standing around for photo ops and such?  I have a secret --- it could have been our  lovely Ann R.!  She was indeed Hello Kitty and you might have taken a picture with her!  

Anywho, Sanrio is every child's playground.  From purses, luggage, home goods, office supplies and more, you can never walk out of this place without something!  This Sanrio is the one I went to when I decided in 8th grade that I was too old to carry my jelly Old Navy backpack and needed a cool, ""sophisticated,"" grown-up Badtz Maru purse.  I still have it today for sentimental reasons but I think it's currently holding junk like old movie ticket stubs.  Movies were only $6 back when I was a youngin...  

Anyways, I love coming here during Christmas when there are plushie ornaments to be bought [Year Three of our tradition Ann --- I still need to choose the one I want!] and I'm sure Nadine C. would agree seeing as how she has a Hello Kitty tree up.  I also like to look at all the stickers I'll purchase and never use.  I think I have hoarding issues.  So yeah!  Come here and spend your paycheck!  Who doesn't love Sanrio?",2014-12-05 19:59:14

I created my own Jachos with taro chips, ebi shrimp, crab, guacamole, pico de gallo, and had the nacho cheese on the side.  Wow, those taro chips are amazeballs!  I could have eaten another serving and plan to very soon.

The b/f created his own Jaburrito with salmon, ahi, brown rice, and chips and was also tempted to get another creation, but the line became super long as we were eating our first go-round.  Word is definitely out on this place.

Sometimes new spots disappoint because those expectations become unreasonably high, but Jaburritos did not; we'll definitely be back sooner than later.

*TIPS:
Our party of six arrived around 6:15pm on Tuesday night and we were lucky enough to snag a table for all of us.  However, it wasn't too long before the place got packed.  It's new, so patience is key.  Check out the menu online so you have an idea of what you'd like to create or try one of their own Jaburritos.",2015-10-21 17:30:36

I got the red pepper hummus and pita, and vegetarian plate (classic and cilantro jalapeño hummus, falafel, stuffed grape leaves and pita), to go. I liked that the items were marked vegetarian, but there was no vegan designation.

The food was about what I expected. The falafels were plump but not very flavorful. I liked the cilantro jalapeño hummus the best of the three. The pita was soft and thick. 

The vegetarian plate was expensive ($10.50) but the hummus and pita was reasonable ($5.95). The fries looked great, but not $3.25 great. 

One recommendation - they need to rework the order line. It seemed very confusing for people and a big crowd stood in the dining area instead of the area against the wall. A rethink/redesigned is needed!

I had been getting them at Costco but for $1 more, i'd rather have the REAL deal. 

Anyway, this location is not my usual Einstein Bros but I was in the area and decided to stop in for my 13 bagels. The employees were very friendly and I got my bucket so quickly! At the Einstein Bros near my house, there is ALWAYS a wait and service can be quite slow, so I was impressed!

After a few bites, it was obvious that the braciole with mostaccioli was a good choice.  However, after several more bites, it became evident that the braciole was overcooked.

The sausage with peppers and potatoes was filling.  The sausage was a bit overcooked, and the peppers and potatoes needed more seasoning.

I love quirky kitschy designs and it had a very vintage-y unique feel to it. The view was great, the soak tub was something I could only dream of in my home. 
We popped our champagne and relaxed before we were going to head off the happy hour. The phone rings, it's one of the clerks asking if she can come up.  We say sure, she wheels in another bottle of champagne, some cup cakes, and a handwritten happy birthday note for my boyfriend Joey.
Yeah, they do a free wine/beer hour in the living room. It's awesome, we got to meet a few really nice great people during our wine hour.

I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.  

We had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.

The salmon and capers were so tasty!

Tonkotsu Ramen $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-The broth is pretty good.  It comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  The pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  

My gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  I mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  It's almost required!!!  I also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  Part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  The egg I got was slightly hard when I got it.

Pork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - Average.  The pork belly is extremely sweet!  I think they use too much sauce or something. The sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  I'd pass on this next time.

I was able to try my friends Takana fried rice and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.

First, the service was lackadaisical at best.  It was very slow to have our order taken, and it took almost 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. The food itself was tasty enough, once it finally arrived.

However, the worst part about this meal was the COCKROACH that we discovered on the wall over our table.  Immediately, my friend and I began to point at it and talk loudly. We tried to get the attention of waitstaff for several minutes.  Finally, the cockroach fell onto our table. That was it. We leapt out of the booth and exclaimed ""COCKROACH!"" Is this the worst part of the visit?  NO.  Waitstaff then came over, pulled back the table, squashed the cockroach, and then gestured for us to resume our meal and said ""Cockroach gone.""

I'm not typically a fan of popcorn, but I've been hearing (and reading) great reviews about this place since they opened so I finally got a chance to check them out today. The place is small and clean with modern decor. As we walked in we were greeted very warmly by the woman behind the counter. She offered us samples to try before we ordered and made chit chat with us while we discussed our ordering decision. Since my family is originally from New Mexico we couldn't resist ordering the 505 to test it out. We also ordered the Dirty Vegas and a small Almond Caramel for good measure.

We took advantage of the 15% off Yelp check-in offer and off we were with our purchases. Each of the flavors was distinct and delicious. The popcorn was extremely fresh and the flavors were unlike any I've had before. The 505 was definitely the star of the show. It's extremely spicy and the hint of white chocolate is a great contrast. The Dirty Vegas is great as well. Edible glitter? Who even knew that was a thing?! I can't wait to finish off the rest of our popcorn so I can go back again soon and try the rest of their delectable flavors, bother sweet and savory.

So why the 3 star? No draft beer. That's just craziness to me. First time I've heard of a craft beer bar that doesn't serve draft beer. I'm not going to go into why there's a higher chance of getting fresher beer from a keg than a bottle or can, but there is. And I can't go out and buy 5 kegs of beer to try 5 types of beer (well I could but that's not practical). Guess what, I can go buy 5 cans/bottles of beer and try them so why should I go to a bar and pay extra for something I can do at home? Yep, I won't.

I don't go downtown often, and Tremont even more rarely, so a Barrio opening up on the east side was possibly the best part of 2017 to date.  It's ridiculously crowded right now, but I imagine it'll die down a bit eventually.  In good news, the hostesses are nice and they'll give you a pager that works as long as you stay within a block or so radius, so you could always grab a drink somewhere nearby while you wait for your turn.

They've got a great bar menu, with a good selection of tequila and margaritas.  A pitcher is approximately 4-5 glasses, which isn't a bad deal.  We split two pitchers with another  couple-- one guava and one blood orange-- and it worked out pretty perfectly.  I liked both, but the blood orange was definitely my favorite of the two.  If you're not a margarita person, I'm confused, but they have other good drinks and a nice beer menu as well.  As far as appetizers go, the queso blanco is excellent.  It reminded me a lot of Moe's queso.

Tacos, however, are the important part of Barrio.  You need 2-3 tacos for a good meal, depending on how hungry you are.  They're only $3-$4 each, so it's a really reasonable night out.  They have a menu of suggested tacos as well as create-your-own.  From the El Jefe suggestion list, I really liked the El Filadelfia steak taco, but my husband didn't care for the braised beef in the Carne Trozo.  Creating your own tacos is more fun, in my opinion. I will warn you not to go overboard on the toppings even though they all sound delicious.  You can bubble in as many items as you like, but if you overload your taco it nets you a giant soggy mess.  Another item worthy of note is that the Green Goddess tortilla option is a calorically terrible choice but also Barrio's gift to the taco world; it has the crispiness of a hard corn tortilla, the structural integrity of a soft flour tortilla, and guacamole and queso to bring it all together.

I'm already perusing the Build Your Own Taco menu to plan out my next visit.  Can't wait to go back.",2017-03-08 17:57:19

In months and especially years past, I would feel full, and have some food leftover to box and take home.  Not anymore.  I just don't feel this place offers good value as of late.

My husband and I hurried over to get a couple of cones. They had probably five different flavors on the menu and I was flabbergasted to see salted caramel flavor which is my favorite of all time. Normally I just have to make it myself since I haven't had a good one outside of San Diego (Haagen Daaz is pretty good too for not having to make it yourself). 

My husband and I both sampled the bacon (bacon bits in a sweet cream base) and I tried the salted caramel (caramel swirls and sea salt in a vanilla base) and my husband also tried the malt ball. I ended up getting the salted caramel and my husband went with the malt ball and we both wished we would have gone with the bacon. Both of our flavors after a few bites tasted very ordinary. My sample had a nice salty taste but my entire scoop tasted only of vanilla. (When I make my caramel ice cream I take all the sugar in the recipe and caramelize it until it's a dark golden color. It gives the ice cream a great flavor and color.) My husband's scoop had nice big chunks of malt balls in it and the vanilla ice cream was fine but with all this anticipation, we really expected something more. The bacon only came in a sweet cream base which I normally don't care for (because for the most part it tastes like nothing - kind of what it's meant to do), but at least that flavor had a personality. 

I looked on-line at their website and the next time I'm in north Scottsdale I'll stop by because their sorbets and frozen yogurts (mango lassi! I've already looked up a recipe) look really good. This visit left me disappointed but still curious about their other flavors.",2009-06-07 22:15:07

We started our meal with a bottle and type of Rosso Sangiovese wine, which was delicate yet crisp. 

Then came out our salads...Romaine Lettuce, ""Bagna Cauda"" Dressing, Croutons, Parmesan Cheese (Insalata Romana in Bagna Cauda, Crostoni, Parmigiano Reggiano)--served with assorted Italian breads. 

For our main courses, I order the Rack of Lamb Crusted in Pecorino and Thyme, Mamma Egi's Peperonata (Carre di Agnello in Crosta di Pecorino e Timo con la Peperonata di Mamma Egi).  The lamb had a savory aroma, tender and delicious in taste.

While my boyfriend ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin, Melted Gorgonzola Cheese, Crushed Yukon Gold Potatoes, Asparagus Wrapped in Prosciutto, Red Wine Garlic Sauce
(Filetto di Manzo Grigliato, Gorgonzola Fusa, Salsa di Vino Rosso all'Aglio, Patate Schiacciate, Asparagi in Prosciutto).  This was a master piece of an Italian ambrosial dish!

They have done wonders renovating the old Remys rooftop patio, which ranges from sunny and inviting during the day and more lounge-y at night.

Regarding the food, I recommend the hamachi ponzu, kasa moto roll, and the shrimp burrito. The hamachi was so delicious and refreshing, but a bit pricey at $18 for a few slices of yellowtail. The poke bowl, pork belly skewers, cauliflower, and broccoli tempura were all tasty but not mind-blowing. The striploin is WAY too salty. Do you like raising your blood pressure by 20 mmHg?

We both opted for the platter options - my friend chose goat curry and I opted for the mutter paneer (normally my fave Indian dish).

They have a dedicated takeout area, so you don't get that awkward ""go to the bar"" issue with the hostess and bar tender.  Their chicken parm and baked spaghetti are good, as are their meatballs and pizza.  Be warned that the pizza is VERY heavy, and not the lighter, fluffy/chewy fare found at Sauce, North, or Federal.  I'd put it more along the lines of Pat's Sicilian, Uno's, or similar ""deep dish"" or ""pan"" pizzas that are fully loaded up with sauce, cheese, and toppings.

The bad: They removed their gigantic, delicious, affordable, perfectly toasted chicken parm sandwich.  That alone is taking them from 4 to 3 stars.  If you're looking for something lighter here, you really have very few options.

The ugly: The golden bbq wings were the most disgusting chicken I've ever tasted in my entire life.  I wish the description said they were basically mustard and nothing else.  Thankfully the server swapped them out for an order of meatballs.  The seafood pasta was also disappointing, with the vodka sauce being pretty weak and the noodles all sticking together in a giant clump.

I am a huge Lotus fan, but Lotus is far and recently been variable.  While brings the same memory as the first time at Lotus, the food and vibe is completely different.  Casual, but demurely hip, if you KWIM.

With its clean lines and simple color palate of grey and red, Chada reminds me of simple modern start up restaurants in NYC...that is a nice look.  While not very big, the place seat about 40 people comfortably. 

As of this point, Chada does not have a liquor license so no alcohol served.  We did take advantage of their courtesy BYOB with no corkage fee!  However, I look forward to their wine selection in the future, though. 

The menu style is all small plates, but the portions are equivalent of atleast 1.5 main dish servings. I hope that doesn't change,  because the dish prices range are extremely affordable ranging from $6-18; most dishes averaging in $8-12.  Some of the fish and beef dishes are in the higher price ranges, but well worth it.

My husband got the spring rolls, which was $6 for 4 rolls...pretty reasonable.  We got 4 oysters in chili sauce and mint for $8, the crispy pork belly with sauteed greens (choy something) for $10?,  Seabass Tod Krueng was phenomenal...extremely tasty, unique generous portion even at $18, and sauteed ribeye in fish sauce.  While execution was still a bit ""slow"" it made for a nice relaxing meal while we sipped on our favorite wines.  Every dish was prepared beautifully.  I can't wait to come back and try all the other dishes too.

A few things.  You can tell the establishment is new, servers are still learning the menu, but they were polite. The menu lack organization, but that can be a good thing, because it makes you look through the entire menu. Once ordered, dishes came out one by one with a bit of lag time in between, but again, it really gave each dish time to be enjoyed.  I can't wait to go back; it better be soon, because I know Chada's popularity is going to skyrocket to the height it deserves.

So why should you prefer this place over other burger places??
1. It's NOT the typical massed produced fast food joint, burgers  here dont have the preservatives and artificial flavors.

2. The burgers are hella good! Seasoned well. Organic. Black Angus 
Beef from Bartels Farms.  Very good quality beef.

3. My beer aficionados friends highly approve of their beer selection. 

4. They have vegetarian/vegan option.  Of all days I came in, it was my Meatless Monday, and was very happy to see Roasted Portobello ...even happier tasted delicious paired with fennel escabeche.

5. From reading the menu and seeing the artisan ingredients used for the different burger selections it shows that Chef Damian is really talented, there are burgers you wont see at other places. 

Our burgers were cooked as requested every single visit. (Med/rare and well done)

The Bleu Cheese with shallot port syrup/bacon mayo that I asked for wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun was really good! The creamy sauce balanced out the sharpness of the bleu cheese.

6, TRUFFLE!! Truffle fries is on the menu...

7. Tator Tots - made in house...that's another reason that pulled me in here, crazy, I know. Honestly Im not crazy for tots, mostly because everyone uses the frozen variety.. Chef though crafts his from a mold that's a little bigger size. The result, crisp on outside, moist AND FRESH potato inside. Ya'll who gripe about not getting very many are just used those bitty preserved ones...smh

tip: ask for it Truffled!! It's not on menu. 

8. Those who love Foie Gras, well you'll be in heaven. Foie is not on the menu but if they have some they can add it to your burger...or make you foie gravy fries..YEA FOIE GRAVY fries!!

9. They have burgers to please everyone.(see #4)  Even non foodies like Mr. B, who likes things plain, traditional.  The Classic burger here with the added burger patty  we requested was pretty impressive.  I knew hubby would approve.  Like I said beef quality is really good.

10. The staff is cool, the prices are on par with speciality burger places IMO.  What I dont get are the  people who spend average 5$ on cup of coffee everyday, then gripe on $$ they spend on a speciality burger?? ...ookay.

The ambiance is chill, it is family friendly,  the dining area is modestly decorated. There's some awesome looking pix of their food hanging on the wall though ;)  I like they're open late on Sundays, cause most places around here are closed early. The first few visits here, I was surprised to see it busy, with repeat customers,  especially since they haven't done any advertising.  Obviously the  local neighborhood knows what good!  Burger Joint is another good asset and option to eat in this area!!",2016-09-26 18:04:53

Potatoes were crispy, burrito was warm and slightly charred, pork had lots of good flavor, sour cream was quality, eggs were nicely placed along the inside of the burrito rather than just shoved in there.

Coffee: solid.

Atmosphere is cool. Although I'd prefer if they blasted the AC some more in this Vegas heat, it must be at least 80 degrees in here. Also, I'd prefer _a bit_ more table space.

Prices are a bit on the high end, but fine. $10-15 for brunch entrees, $4-6 for coffee.

The location isn't great. It's south of the ""cool"" part of Fremont Street, and is pretty sketchy. I consider Public Us to be the cutoff point - south of Public Us is sketchy and I wouldn't recommend walking around. North gets to the touristy part, but it's like a 5 minute walk before you get to the center of the touristy part, along the way it's half cool half sketchy.",2017-06-24 19:34:13

Regardless, The Kitchen is totally comparable to Dish... while I noticed a few changes, the similarities are much more evident.

They have the same layout, the same fresh selection of gourmet prepared foods, and possibly even friendlier employees and lower prices.  I missed a few items on the salad bar (avocado, garbanzo beans), but I made due just fine...

Lunch for two was just $17 and included a delicious salad with iceberg lettuce, green olives, tomato, and shrimp + balsamic on the side (that was my order); and my friend went with a freshly made to order caprese sandwich that looked dynamite.  It came with a small soup as well which I ended up taking to-go.  Add two bottles of water, and I would say that is pretty reasonable, wouldn't you?

We had a 15% off coupon from the hotel so we basically had the tip paid for when all was said and done.  Here's what you need to know.  Pizza Rock is NOT Pizza HUT.  You will be seated with a menu and you will have choices of pizzas that have been designed for you already.  They have different types of crusts and are cooked in different types of ovens and some take much longer than others.  It's very important to ask the server to go over the menu with you so you know what you're getting and then you get to figure out something to share.  The ingredients are very fresh and I THINK we chose the American Classic - Downtown 19.  It was really tasty.  The ingredients were piled high on a medium crust and it was just a mouthful of flavors, especially considering we're usually just plain old pepperoni and pineapple.  And we LOVED the pepperoni they have.  YUM.  Also, we had the garlic bread before the pizza came out and I CAN NOT RECOMMEND YOU EAT THIS ENOUGH!   It's so freaking good, might be the best garlic bread ever with WHOLE garlic cloves on it!  In fact, I want that right now... I might have to make some at home tonight.

They have a good selection of beers and some rotating ones as well.

The ambiance is kind of loud, but fun and there are like two little tucked away 2 tops with curtains that are sort of semi-private.  If you think you might want one, ask at the desk before you get seated!  That's where we sat and we liked it and everyone who walked by said, ""oh, I want to sit there"".   There's your tip.  Great, now it will be full when we go back.  Ah well.

KmCZjc1UJoPKNrwxG1uuHg,LAwyrUSg6BrQUK3Pr-NK5Q,q5I1eO_K6AHC-3B8DB9Caw,2,6,4,0,"This place was weird. 

First: the location. It's in what feels like an abandoned shopping center (though it's clearly not abandoned, the grocery store a few shops down is gone, so this place feels empty). The restaurant feels like it could just as easily be a laundromat or daycare with a few swaps of furniture or lighting, which I think is because of the bay of windows on the front side. Never fear, anxious car owners, you'll be able to watch your precious Porsche outside throughout your meal to ensure no one dings its doors. Also strange was the outdoor seating. It felt like a sidewalk sale would have been more appropriate in that space, but instead you see white tablecloths and bottles of wine. Confounding. 

Next, let's discuss the decor. Dated. Mishmash. Not what you'd expect of a restaurant charging these prices. 

Third, the food. It was mediocre. The flavors were underdeveloped, the meat was universally overcooked (rubbery shrimp and hard as rocks fish, no bueno), and the appetizer felt like a sodium-laden cheese attack you'd find at a generic American food chain. The dessert wasn't really worth it, either: I think the chocolate syrup was Hershey's. And worst of all: at 6:30 PM on a Friday night, they were already running out of food. Completely out of scallops. And their substitute was ""more shrimp,"" on a dish that claimed to include both shrimp and scallops, but the dish came out bearing only a handful of shrimp and no smaller a price tag for the scallop-free and shrimp-lite experience. Not the way to do it, folks. 

Things they did well: service. Our waiter clearly had a little ""bit"" he liked to use with customers, but it was cute. The grains (served under my rubbery shrimp) were cooked to perfection. That's about it.",2015-08-15 11:19:33

As you walk in you step up to a counter to order. The first thing you notice is how incredibly beautiful it is. The decor is minimalist meets shabby chic meets cafeteria, sort of. It's very hard to describe, but it's very attractive. The dichotomy between what you think it is and what it actually is happens to be very striking. It's like fast food but with serious gourmet style.

The menu is wildly diverse. From sandwiches to gourmet entrees to breakfast; this place has everything you could want. 

It seems rather new so there were some hiccups; I asked for healthy vegetarian and the guy taking my order had to ask someone, but it's only been open a few months. I'm pretty sure it will get up to speed pretty quickly.

I ordered (to go - but I had to sit at a table and wait for it) the fresh black bean ravioli and let me tell you it was some of the best ravioli I've ever had in my life. Bar none. It was also VERY affordable. The portion size was perfect and it was about $10. And did I mention it was AWESOME?

It was sitting on a bed of fresh spinach and surrounded by salsa fresca and sauteed vegetables julienne style. The roasted red pepper cream sauce didn't seem all that healthy, but it didn't seem unhealthy; no thick heavy cream taste. It was light and delicious. I almost fainted, seriously. The food is GREAT.

You get your drinks from a fountain machine and all your condiments are on pretty shelf. It's just a really nice place. The people are incredibly helpful and polite.

I highly recommend this place. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because of the wait (it advertises as 'express gourmet') and because I think the staff should really learn the menu a little better. Other than that it's definitely a new favorite!",2014-04-30 23:10:50
44tGjOU0unV124BplkQfYw,QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,4,8,4,7,"When Yardbird opened up earlier this year, I was dying to get in there and eat. For whatever reason, it took a few months us to finally go, but it was my birthday, and as good of as a reason as ever. We just recently went again for the second time for a friends birthday, and Yardbird has definitely solidified itself as one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.

A quick tip for those coming in for the first time. I think it's a lot easier to come into the The Palazzo parking garage off Spring Mountain. When you park, there's elevators that take you right up into the casino, then a short walk through the area with the big fountain, and Yardbird is right there. For me, that garage seems a lot easier to access, and it's almost never full either.

Anyhow, the restaurant itself is pretty cool. A bit smaller than you would expect, but we recently found out they have a little private dining area as well. It, like the rest of the restaurant has a lot of homey, classic southern style decor. Lots of wood, old pictures, and the private room has a wall full of liquors and a view of the wine cellar. They also have a nice section of the wall with a hidden TV that rotates pictures of musicians. If you have a large party to eat with here, definitely ask if that room is available. It makes for an even more enjoyable experience.

Now, the menu at Yardbird is pretty stout. It might seem small at first glance, especially since only one page is dedicated to food...but there's a lot of options, and the portions are huge. Their food is meant to be shared, so order up and have at it family style. 

So far, we've only been for brunch, but I think we've had just about everything on that menu besides the salads. Out of the 5 starter small plates, the only thing we haven't tried is the pork, but everything else is spectacular. Stand outs for me are the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the Mama's Chicken Biscuits. Both on the pricey side at $14, but worth every cent. And that's not to take away from the Deviled Egg's or Chicken Liver Toast either, which are equally impressive, and even quite a bit cheaper.

Moving on to the main dishes, you can't not mention the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Yes, it's $36...but if you're idea of eating good involves chain restaurants and fast food, you shouldn't be here anyway. Not to mention, it easily serves 3 or 4 people, maybe more depending on what else you order. The chicken is absolutely amazing. Crispy, crunchy, but still tender and juicy. Their cheddar cheese waffles are unbelievable, and they serve them with this green tomato pepper jam stuff that ties everything in for a taste bud party. And I'm not even a watermelon fan...at all...but I enjoy their spiced watermelon served alongside it as well. 

The Shrimp n' Grits is another stand out for main dishes. A large bowl of creamy grits, topped with large, juicy shrimp, and little crispy bits of ham make for an excellent breakfast. It's another higher cost plate at $28, but even it can be shared with at least 2 people no problem.

A lot of there smaller items off their ""Odds and Ends"" menu are great too. First time visits, I'd suggest ordering the Macaroni & Cheese and Skillet Cornbread. And when you're done with all that, look right over to the right for dessert items. Since I've never had something there I didn't like, I'd say go for it all. The Mini Bacon Doughnuts, Chess Pie, Hickory Smoked Chocolate Coffee Cake and Cinnamon Apple Hand Pies are all excellent choices. 

My one and only biggest gripe with Yardbird is not so much the service itself, as it's almost always excellent, but both times we've been here, they have forgotten dishes. Our first time here, they completely left out an order of Deviled Eggs. This past visit they forgot to bring out an order of Shrimp n' Grits, so one of our party had to exit the room and go ask for it. Then when it came time to order dessert, they completely forgot an order of the bread budding. Luckily we were all pretty much at breaking point, but it's irritating to say the least. Especially when this place specializes on family style eating and having guests order multiple plates. To be honest, I'm not even 100% sure if we paid for the missing items on either visit either. 

When all is said and done though, Yardbird is seriously one of the most enjoyable and memorable places to eat. It's not crazy expensive for what you get, and if you come with a group of people, the experience is even that much better, and your bill will be cheaper to split. On both occasions we've spent close to $300, but that's for big parties of 8 or more, and with tip. There's not many places you can spend about $30-$40 per person while getting that much food and being able to sample that many items.

They have seating outside (which was packed) and lots of seating inside.  The moment you walk in, the place smells like delicious pizza.  The place is decorated with New York style stuff and cute lights made out of old wine bottles.

The small pizza is enough for 3 people for sure.  We all ordered a salad- each salad is also enough for 3 people.  I had the caprese salad, not the best I have had... but ok.  My husband got the Caesar- which he loved.  And our friends (who come here all the time) got the house salad- which looked REALLY good.

We ordered the pepperoni pizza.  Each topping costs from $2 & up.  The pepperoni was tiny pepperoni, which is my fav.  The sauce is the best I can remember having and the crust is perfect!!  People usually call this crust thin crust, I thought it was more medium crust.  If the dough is good, I usually like a little more... but this was great.

I ordered the xxl cheeseburger, chili cheese fries,  and a coke. I think the tab came to around $15, give or take a few.  Yep, it's a tad spendy,  but in my opinion you do generally have to pay for quality,  and for fair wages for the grill staff. I don't  mind, my understanding is  (  and maybe I'm  wrong,  but I don't think so ) they pay the workers better than most Fast Food burger stands.

Anyway,  the burger and chili fries were AMAZING. I'll  be honest,  the sheer size and majesty of that xxl cheeseburger scared me a little  ( that doesn't happen often ) I wondered if id be able to ""kill the beast "" !   Huge. Juicy. Flavorful. Unique. A classic monster built burger. Did I mention Flavor ?  Abundantly flavorful.

The chili cheese fries are also amazing - because they are prescisely  what chili cheese fries are supposed to be, in my opinion. Thick tasty fries, smothered in flavorful chili with cheese. No beans. No fake cheese. No greasy limp fries. They were wonderful.

Like I mentioned at the top,  I hadn't  been a customer for years. The last Fatburger I ate at was in Redondo Beach,  So Cal.  Then moved to Idaho,  then here to beautiful Vegas !   So happy to see Fatburger has a presence here  :-)

Review is for BAR / LOUNGE area

Went on a Thursday night... it (the bar.. not the main dining area which was hopping)...was pretty quiet around 8:30pm when we walked in and sat down at the bar... the bartenders were busy filling orders but all took time to say Hi and welcome us.

We enjoyed a couple drinks and a snack... 

NOTE:  all drinks can be tweaked to your discretion per the bartenders... so if the main liquor is gin.... you can sub vodka... or make up your own concoction... they are game there

Ramble: Tasty + Light + Refreshing = Dangerous because you could drink way too many of these and then when you stand up... BAM... it'll hit you
I don't remember what all it had in it (sorry...) but it had muddled raspberries and vodka and shave ice and something else... Yes... it's a Girlie Drink... and I'm a Girl... so YUM!

Dark & Stormy: base is dark rum with ginger and lemon... and I think club soda for a bit of fizz... in any case... it held up to it's name... dark with flavor explosions... the ginger really complements the rum in a way I would never have imagined... it is a unique taste.. and you have to like ginger...  unlike the Ramble... I don't think I could drink a bunch of these in one sitting

Tarte Flambee: so this was a mistake on the bartender... we wanted the Apple Tart and somehow he heard Tarte Flambee... go figure... but it was a TASTY MISTAKE... I'm not complaining...
It's like a flatbread with caramelized onions, ham and cheese...
In any case... melt in your mouth... my mouth did a little dance of happiness.... It is RICH... so only a few pieces need be enjoyed.

That's it, we didn't see Santa, the crafts table looked boring, the bounce houses my boys showed no interest in and we never saw the skating rink. 


10/1/17- Our last visit for the season. It was my son's 14th bday and we had decided to take advantage of the last of our season tickets. Arrived at noon and Gladys (the parking goddess) was on my side. We wanted to sit by the wave pool this time but couldn't find a perfect spot so we ended up on the grass, shaded tree and perfect view of the Canyon Cliff slide. It wasn't crowded and didn't come across any bees! I get worried about the bees when I come here. But still, I bought season tickets and I'm not wasting it. This day couldn't be more perfect. 

Overall for this season:

1. Get those bees under control! On all occasions we were here except for the last day, we had to keep changing our spot due to bees. We bought food and that made it worse. We couldn't finish our food and had to toss it or risk getting stung. That is NOT going to happen again, if you read my past reviews. 

2. Buy a super brella- I know prefer a spot on the grass next to a tree. 

3. The Tornado is our favorite family ride. 

4. There's a bar (hello beer)! I haven't bought alcohol here but my husband and I have hung out there while waiting for the boys. The seats are comfy and next to our ride the Tornado. 

5. On our last day, my husband decided not to join us on the Tornado ride so the boys and I had to carry the tube by ourselves to the top and it was very obvious we were having a hard time. We had to let some people pass cause we were so slow. And employee was nice enough to carry the tube for us the rest of the way. What a gentleman! I also have to add that there was a man who was already carrying a tube for his family and still offered to help us. Love places where people are so kind. 

6. The wave pool is not as much fun compared to other water parks we've been to and we love water parks. We love the water and just being out in the sun. I buy so much sunscreen that I buy them online in bulk. Btw, they offer free sunscreen here. 

7. I'm the kind of person that resist change but I'm seriously considering Cowabunga next time. We've never been there and really want to see the difference. I heard the water is warmer too there, although I've never had any complaints with the water at Wet'n'Wild. We shall see...

Bye summer and welcome fall!",2017-12-09 13:53:51

This is the only e-ticketing theater for MoviePass in Charlotte, so it's your only choice if you don't want to be limited in movie selection. 

One really nice thing about this theater is that they validate parking for up to 4 hours in the Epicenter parking garage. Check in is easy at the kiosks -- you can just scan your phone to print the ticket if you purchased online. 

One thing I don't like much about this theater is the seats. They don't recline and they aren't that comfortable. The tray for the food is also really annoying if you aren't eating (couldn't they have them fold down?). The worst part is how loud this theater gets because of the ability to order food during the movie. The servers are constantly walking back and forth and talking to people ordering. It's really distracting from being able to watch the movie. 

The only reason I would recommend this theater is if you have a MoviePass. Otherwise, you're better off at another theater.",2018-08-27 21:51:38

Both the chocolate and raspberry flavours were more muted than I expected and the macaron itself didn't have that satisfying melt-in-your-mouth, slightly chewy texture that I love. To be honest, I think it's all just hype; the only thing about these macarons that is reminiscent of a donut is the shape, and while that's cute and all, I don't think I'll be paying $2.50 for a smaller, average tasting macaron again.

On a more positive note, the mini sandwich and eclair that I tried were delicious! I got the buffalo mozzarella, arugula, & pesto on rye and the famous gianda gold eclair; the rye baguette was perfect - nice, crisp crust but still soft when you bite into it - and the rich hazelnut filling in the eclair definitely satisfied my sweet tooth. I would come back just to try more of their sandwiches and eclairs.

It wasn't packed, which I was afraid of. I got there at about 6PM, however the stream of people started to come in there after. 

I ordered the Tropical Storm Roll:   

""California roll topped with 3 layers of fresh sashimi (tuna, salmon and yellow-tail), then covered with multicolored tobiko (flying fish egg) for a fantastic presentation. Served with a side of wasabi yuzu dipping sauce""

The roll itself was lovey, very pleasing to look at. I have to order my sushi without wasabi as I am allergic to it. I know... what the hell right! 

The yellow tail was lovely, so fresh it literally melted in my mouth, the multicolored tobiko was outstanding! All with distinctly different flavors - I really enjoyed that. 

However the only bad thing was the salmon, and this is just a personal thing... they didn't spend enough time with this fish - it had cartilage or bone... something chewy and hard. It did not melt like the others. 

I did enjoy the roll, even though they put that wasabi yuzu dipping sauce on my plate... luckily it could just be removed and pushed to the side. No harm there. 

Met Meghan, a manager, and she rocks! She gave me some good pointers for when I search for a Casa de Diabla! And a great conversation - thanks!

I look forward to my next visit, everyone there was super friendly and helpful. The fish, that is a personal thing, not a reflection of the kitchen/sushi bar. This is a great location as well - very easy to get too.

So when I heard about this place I was very excited to try it. This is a tiny little hole in the wall that serves New York style pizza-very clean inside with an authentic rustic feel. The restaurant itself is not a sit down type of place there is only a few seats inside. BUT if you go in the summer time they have a little bench outside or else you can grab some slices to go and eat at a picnic table in the park closeby. The pizza slices are huge and thin crust and not overly oily/greasy. They definitely hit the spot if you're having a pizza craving and 1-2 slices are more than enough to fill you up ! Service was quick , no frills and efficient. We tried a pepperoni and cheese slice and a meat lovers slice. Both slices were tasty but it wasn't necessarily the best pizza I've had. My three star rating is not because the food wasn't good because it was. it was more because while i enjoyed it , I wasn't blown away by it. the prices are ok and the service while efficient could have been a little bit friendlier and more welcoming. Also the fact that there isn't really any indoor seating also is a factor during the winter months. All in all I did enjoy it and would encourage any pizza lover to give it a try because I think the food was good , they just had a few points they could improve on. It wouldn't be my number one pick when I'm craving pizza BUT like I said I did enjoy it and I would like to go back and try some of the other slices.",2017-02-16 22:41:49
fxPsx7LuYlk6ypMQGSE_xQ,M9TjYmTgHayJ22cNkyvW_g,1DSEqxx6wxF2zwpPDBwtOg,3,1,1,1,"I like Sugar Cafe. Like it, but don't love it. I mean, I WANT to love them; their shop is adorable - the tables are quaint, there's a comfy couch and lounge area in the corner, and there's even a tree up in their building right now. It looks and feels like a sweet little spot, right down to the ""Keep calm and eat cupcakes"" poster that I always want to take with me when I come here.

Alas, nothing can be perfect. So, my points:

I actually think their menu is a bit short, and could probably benefit from having a few seasonal items that change every few months (although it's probably just suffering as a result of the currently increasing prices of fresh ingredients, which affects many local businesses this time of year). I find their breakfast menu in particular to be waaaay too short and limiting; I'm sure every item on there is delicious, but at the same time, basically all I can get for breakfast is a bagel, muffins, granola or pancakes. That's a lot of carb-heavy options, guys!

Lunch is definitely more Sugar Cafe's forte. Anything from a grilled cheese to tuna melt bagels to a fancy vegetarian option is here, and each sandwich can come with a variety of sides, from regular chips to potato salad. I definitely prefer to eat here this time of day since there's more to eat and choose from. I highly recommend the tuna melt bagel, which to date is the best item I've had here.

Finally, I'm sure anyone who hears the name ""Sugar Cafe"" has guessed that they (supposedly) specialize in desserts. Personally, I think the desserts are...okay. I remember a friend I went with commented their creme brulee wasn't perfect, and in my case the cupcakes I've had have been a bit hard, dry and cold from sitting in a fridge for too long. I'm sure if you get them fresh, they're wonderful.

If you have the time to stop in during their limited hours, I'd it's definitely worth a shot, particularly for lunch. Hopefully you hit the cafe on a good day!",2012-12-13 22:34:47

My boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two Phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college. He has weird accelerometer-type machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the Big Bang Theory proud. Kudos to the Arizona Science Center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us.

We started on the 4th floor at the Solarville exhibit which focused on energy, the environment, and conservation. It talked about individual household energy usage, and ways to reduce environmental impact. The 3rd floor had the Forces of Nature and Technology exhibits, which both offered interactive and informative displays. The 2nd floor was all about electricity, so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge. The coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the ""All About Me"" exhibit. It covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects. The neuroscience portion was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests.

Admission was $14, not including special exhibits or films. We had a limited amount of time and didn't get to check out any of the extras (IMAX film, planetarium, pirate exhibit). We saw almost all of the museum in 2 and half hours. We were there in the early afternoon on a weekday, and it seemed like most of the school groups had cleared out by then.

I got an iced matcha milk tea and a honey toast and the total was $10.08 after a $1 tip.  They were running a special to where you get 10% off your total if you buy a drink and a dessert. 

I'd never had honey toast before...if you've never had one either for crissakes drop what you're doing right now and go get one of these things!  Imagine a big hunk of japanese bread, toasted to perfection, with slits cut into the top so the butter and honey go cascading down into the creases, topped with your choice of ice cream (I got green tea) and topped with your choice of fruits etc.  This is the simplest idea ever but executed well and I could eat this anytime, day or night.  There's a little sign that says honey toast takes 15 minutes but it came out much faster than that.  

After inhaling the honey toast I turned to my drink.  If I didn't have any manners I would have spit it back into the cup.  It was terrible.  I grew up in Tennessee and it reminded me of going fishing in a pond in the summertime.  It was like picking up a bluegill fish out of the pond and licking it.  It was fishy and disgusting and I left it sitting there. I really think they used seaweed powder instead of matcha.   I've never asked for my money back just because I don't like something; I think that's rude.

1. its expensive for what you get
2. Unless you order the OMG burger, all others come with basic gourmet topings and nothing else!.  I ordered a market burger that came with a pesto spread and blue and brie cheese. I figured it will also come with lettuce, tomato, whatever..I did not ask and it just came like that, plain. The burger as is was ~$12, and you need to add $1 for any extra toppings, not great
3. services was incredibly slow and crappy. Even though there were free tables at the place and no signs of whether we should seat ourselves or get seated, the waitress made us wait 15 mins by the door. We were about to leave when she came and told us to pick any table as there was no hostess and they don't have a seating service.  Well, a sign would have been useful, you think?
4. The beers they have are the one good thing, however I will skip on the burgers.

For now, I will continue on my quest for the best burger place in TO.  From what I have tried thus far - Craft Burger, Grindhouse, etc. I stick with the Yellow Griffin pub on bloor west village.

Lots of great places to eat, especially breakfast.  Though it wasn't a great room, I would classify it as good.  Bathroom was a little small but decent. I always like a great shower and this one was good.  But the floor was too slippery when wet.  Bed comfort was average. I do wish there were lights in the middle of both beds (we got two queens).  And the TV remote sucked, literally only worked to turn it on and off.  Could not change a channel.
Upgrade was offered for a view of Bellagio and the fountains.  Instead we just walked out the hotel and watched the fountain show for free and saved 40.
But overall, really nice hotel, awesome location, great service and a great price.  I will definitely stay here again.",2015-07-14 02:51:40

It seems they did this to get themselves and Golden Gate listed in the top 5 when people search by lowest price, so ya gotta like that creativity.  I just hate the trend of downtown NON RESORT hotels opening the door for sneaky resort fees, this is a big reason why I avoid the strip.

The D has hands down the best video poker in Downtown, possibly all of Vegas (South Point & Silverton give them a good run).  Great table games and dealers, great bars (upstairs is my favorite).  Nice steakhouse & Coney Island hot dog joint.  Loved the grill, great food, great prices and first rate service.  The rooms are really excellent, nicely decorated and some great views.  I really like the Premium Corner Kings.  Big rooms, decent price.

Staff was hit and miss, dealers & bartenders were great, restaurant staff was excellent, twice a manager came over and asked if everything was to our liking, very nice touch.  Check in staff, players club & valet were hit and miss, some great some disinterested, everyone's allowed an off day I suppose.

We had a hummus style starter which was also great. Cocktails were on-point and the service was lovely. The ambience was intimate and relaxing which was perfect for a date on a colder early winter night.

I have heard so much great things about their food at the Tempe location.  Bummed when I finally had time they closed and was moving to the Mesa location.  So when L said they are open NOW, lets go I was drooling...  =)  

The Mesa location is new, nice, and clean.  It was pretty roomy too.  Got there at 6:20pm, we had a reservation for 6 to 7 people at 6:30pm.  They tired to give us a table for 4, so we had to stress that we have 6 to 7 people.  They sat us in a corner table but it was only for 5.  We had to ask for 2 more chairs twice.  Service was very slow (snail speed).  Our other 3 people finally joined us around 6:40 and then 6:45pm.  We ordered drinks and app.  We got the poutine (french fries covered in cheese curds and gravy) not on the menu.  The drinks and the app came out quick.  Yum!  We munched and then she came back to take our order around 7:05pm.  She told us that the kitchen was backed up and was going to put our ticket in in 5 mins so all the dishes would come out together and hot.  

Ok.  fast foward to 7:50pm.  The app was licked clean, drinks are empty, and we are straving.  After watching a few tables that came after us eat and left, we were feeling like did they lose our ticket?  We flagged the another server down to check because we have not see our server for the last 20 mins or more.  She told us our ticket is 4th  in line, but she couldn't tell us how much longer.  How did our ticket get push that far back?  Especially watch people that came after us get food.

The owner, she was making her rounds with the tables.  She came to ours and thought we were finished.  Oh NO, we have not received our food yet.  We told her we have been waiting for almost 1 hour.  I have proof, I have been bored and I was taking pictures and the time is stamped on them.  The owner came back from the kitchen with the POS receipt and said we didn't put in our order until 7:28pm.  OH NO, we gave our order to the server a little after 7pm, if she choose to sit on it for over 20 mins that is not my problem.  YOU JOKING?  The serve came back and told us I told you I was going to put your order in after 10 mins.  Oh no, you said 5 min.  Either way, ordered at 7:05 + 10 mins = 7:15pm not 7:28pm.  They blamed that it was that we were waiting for people.  So how in the heck did you get their orders if they were not here yet?  WHAT?  OK, now I am hungry and pissed.  It is 8;05pm now.  My butt can tell me how long I have been sitting.  

At 8:19pm the food FINALLY got here.  And guess what?  Some of the orders were wrong; most of the food was on a cold plate with luke warm food; and then a food runner showed up with an extra plate of food.  OMG, what a cluster fxck!  We were scope sides of other's plates and trading food until we assembled something close to what we ordered.  

We were finished eating and then the wait for the bills.  We all had our wallets out and were ready.  She dropped off the bills and we asked her for a box togo.  Nothing.  Then she came back to pick up the money & bills.  Took another 10 mins before the change is coming back.  Then the wait for the togo box starts.  We finally left at 9:05pm.

The softserve is always gorgeous and the caramels/melts are pure addiction.

They also do Date Nights on Friday and Saturday nights with special desserts. Which is great because they have day hours (check them before you go). There isn't much seating inside, so I usually just take it all to go but that's just me.

Vegan and vegetarianism being no exception, as I've experienced living 'round these prairie parts as a vegan for 8 or so years. However, it is restaurants such as the Coup, which give me some hope. Aside from the long wait times, as this has become some sort of hipster hang out (dietary restrictions are obviously hip, guys), I have never really had a Coup experience that was less than pleasant. It is ambient when it's quiet and you are having dinner with a friend or two by pseudo candlelight. It is buzzing and full of positive, warm energy when it's busy; a reminder of Calgary's growing globally conscious, veggie fueled community. 
A lovely little nook for eats indeed. After trying everything vegan friendly on the menu at least twice, I'd have to recommend the Sundried Tomato Hummus and Upstream Burger with yam wedges for those who have never been.

When you sit down you are given a paper menu where you can tick off quantities of everything you'd like. There are several columns on the ordering sheet marked as Round 1, Round 2, etc as you place an order and then the sheet is brought back so that you can order more food.

Individual dishes in an order are not necessarily all brought out at the same time, but like items are grouped (e.g. all hand cones come out together).

On this visit, I tried several items:
- tempura mixed veggies included large pieces or squash, eggplant, zucchini and broccoli. These were hot and fresh from the fryer
- sunomono salad and kimchi: these dishes are refreshing compared to the heavier rice-based items. As the portions are small, they are nice to have with every round
- hand cones: this was my first time having a hand cone. It was tasty, but i found the seasweed heavy at the end
- crispy wontons: these were filled with a teeny portion of pork and served with a sweet and sour sauce, nice small portion for an easy bite
- the rolls: I tried the tempura yam and cucumber/avocado. Both were just as good as I'd expect from a regular sushi restaurant. They were presented nicely with other rolls ordered for the table.

I dined here around noon on a Saturday. During my time there, the restaurant was never more than 1/3 full. Service was prompt and friendly. The cost to eat at lunch is $18 per person.

That's where I tend to go to breakfast when I want a good quality breakfast for an average to good price.  However, on Sunday they tend to have long lines and a long wait.  So I chose ""The Egg I am"" as a second choice.  Never been there before so I tried it.  
Ordered The whole wheat pancake that came with two eggs and two strips of bacon.  The poached eggs came with some water on the dish so I soaked it up with a napkin.  Bacon was good, not too salty.  The whole wheat pancake was uneventful.  I don't know what I disliked about it the most but I would never order it again and it doesn't light a candle to IHOP's Harvest Grain whole wheat pancakes.  OOPs, did i mention IHOP again?  
Hubby, who always watches his svelte figure, decided that he didn't want anything that came with meats--so he went as an ""independent"" so to speak---a la carte as they say in the restaurant business.  He wanted two eggs scrambled, rye toast, and home fries.  Sorry, no home fries here (he loves home fries---his heart must have been broken, but he didn't say a word because ""Eggs I am"" was my choice) .  Did I tell you IHOP makes excellent home fries?? Oops. They offered him Ranch potatoes instead.  What the H... are those, we wondered and soon found out.  Ranch potatoes are these pale cubes of tasteless potatoes.   Couldn't you put a crisp on those potatoes on the grill right before you are going to serve them to your clients who got out of bed, brushed their teeth, showered, combed their hair, got dressed, and gassed up the car just to get to you for breakfast on a Sunday morning???????? 
BTW, Mr. Slim and Trim (hubby) asked for the scrambled eggs to be made dry --meaning no butter.  So when they arrived, I asked if I could taste them.  And then the revelation:  These tasted like an egg mix not real eggs.  Just like they do in Las Vegas buffets.... they have a mix that they add water to and voila scrambled eggs.  We asked Carol our waitress and she said they were fresh eggs.  Deny, deny, deny.  I have tasted these ""paste"" eggs before and I can tell the difference.  Hubby poured a bunch of jalapeño hot sauce on the eggs and was able to eat them with his toast.  Did we say toast?  The definition of toast is that bread is darkened on both sides.  This rye bread did not enter the crevices of any working toaster.  It was so light that I asked him if he wanted real toast, but hubby being the gentlemen that he is said that the toast was OK.  Do we go out to have food that is OK???  I can make better than OK food (at least for breakfast).  This is why standards in restaurants go downhill because people like Mr. Slim and Trim say it is OK.  
To top off the experience, I checked the bill and it had other items added to it.  Did I have iced tea?  Nope.  Did I have coffee? Nope.  Nothing like a padded bill to top off a bad breakfast.  Oh, excuse me.  I don't want Mr. Slim and Trim to be offended---an OK breakfast.",2015-06-28 18:54:01

After my last lunch there, I have to say that the quality and service at this particular location have gone  way down. I went here for lunch the week before Christmas with two other people. Initially two of us ordered soup and salad combo and added a crab cake to the salad, for an additional cost.  The other party got the chicken tortilla soup and I tried the soup of the day which was Black bean. 

When my soup arrived there were very few black beans in it, mostly onion, celery and tomatoes. I had to exchange it for the chicken tortilla which was tasty but could have had more chicken in it. The salads were okay but the crab cakes were very small and very bready, not much crab taste. 

The third person in our party ordered the the portabello mushroom sandwich. She expected he mushroom and tomato and onion garnishments to be grilled and warm. They were not.  The sandwich was cold. Also there was supposed to be feta on the sandwich and she tasted none. She sent it back and got a soup and salad combo.

We attempted to follow up with or waiter but he was not very attentive. Finally we contacted the manager. He was apologetic and took off the sandwich and did not charge her for the combo which we appreciated. He tried to make it right, and I give him credit for that.

We had dined here earlier in the year and had a disappointing meal. It feels like FB is cutting corners but not the prices. The food is not cheap but it is not of good quality. And there is really no excuse for poor service. You have to train your people to come back, check on diners, ask if everything is okay, refill glasses etc.  Our server was absolutely clueless. If serving is not your thing, you need another line of work. We typically tip 18-20% but this server was lucky to get the basic 15%. I don't see us returning there any time soon.",2016-12-26 03:50:43

As a good Yelper would do  I fired up my Yelp app and read the reviews and some entree suggestions. After perusing the menu and consulting with my fellow Yelpers suggestions, I settled on the pulled pork, bao buns, collard greens and the spiral potatoes. Everything was good. The pulled pork came in a mound of meat, yep that's right, it literally was a mound of meat and it was drizzled in a homemade ""bbq sauce"" which has a little kick to it. The spiral potatoes are good and the seasoning they are dusted in also has a little kick to it. Now I'm from the south and southerners love our greens especially our collards. I was a little skeptical about eating collard greens in a Korean restaurant but I said what the hell, you only live once, and I tried them. They were pretty good and well seasoned. The bao buns were warm and delicious. Overall its plenty of food and even if you get the smaller portion, its enouhh to share. 
One other important thing, they have a lot of beers, cider and cocktails. Not sure what you want to dri k, you can ask for a sample of the beer or cider youre pondering.

First this was my first and will be my only order placed. At 11:45 AM I placed and order for Chicken Fried Rice. This is always my first order when going to a new place for lunch. I was told my order would take 30 minutes. Thirty minutes for a simple dish at lunchtime on a Monday? When I arrived 30 minutes later the girl out front asked who I was and went to the kitchen. When she came back she said he had just started preparing it for me.

Before arriving I was expecting a well oiled machine that could just not keep up with the volume because their food was just so good. But I was wrong, it's a very small place and seems quite dysfunctional. There were only two other to-go orders packed and ready and a total of ten people dining inside.

While I was waiting a previous lunchtime customer came back in and was obviously very disappointed. She had had to wait 20 minutes to come pick up her order and when she got home it was cold. Cold enough to bring back the meal and ask for a refund.

She had ordered the $6.95 lunch special but had told them she didn't want the drink which was included in the price. But the counter girl wanted to refund her $3.95 and not the $6.95 she had paid. This was a quite bizarre ordeal to witness. The girl behind the counter arguing with the customer and trying to short change her refund.

Needless to say I will not be going back. My meal was plentiful but not well prepared nor flavorful.",2014-12-29 20:52:57

So we strolled into the place, and inside the entrance way is nicely decorated with a picture of a palatial home with palm trees .. of which I presume was shot in the Philippines?  Perhaps it's Max's house. hahah :)

Two friendly hostesses greeted us and showed us to our table, which was located in a separate room further in the restaurant. Looking around, It seemed like this would be a party room as it had an overhead projector mounted on the ceiling and there were sliding glass doors on each side which could be closed off for private (karaoke?) parties. 

Once seated our waiter greeted us with the biggest smile found on this side of the continent, and addressed me as ""boss"", okay sure.  So he presented the menus --- which showed pictures and descriptions of the dishes along with the history of the establishment inside the front cover.  There was a good variety of the popular filipino foods such as pancit, lumpia, speciality drinks such as halo halo, and of course the fried chicken. Although there was quite a variety of foods, we wanted to sample two things and two things only: the fried chicken and lumpia shanghai!! Ahhhhh yeah!!
 
The moment of truth...........

One bite and we were in fried chicken heaven! The skin was crisp, the meat was tender and juicy. It tasted great with the banana ketchup sauce of which my fiancee had never tried before. 

Now for the lumpia shanghai...the lumpia was contained in a cute crisp basket.   We devoured them one by one including the basket itself! ( don't worry the basket was edible heh)

To sum it up, Max's Chicken offers a unique product while bringing the local flavors of the Phillipines to Toronto, which has not yet reached the mainstream popularity when dining out.

Met Violeta H. for happy hour.  Loved the atmosphere here!  Warm shades of amber and gold, and textures of cork, wood, and metal married beautifully.  It was only later, when presented w/ paybooks that looked and felt like cork, that I noticed that the floor tile was made to look like cork!  Cunning, this, I thought.  

[In our excitement to finally try Cork for the first time, I'd neglected to tell V. that Andrea K. might try to join us later on (and later still, Andrea's friend Brynn!)].

Violeta and I started our most enjoyable evening by ordering champagne.  Hers was flavored w/ Kir (cherry liqueur) and mine w/ St. Germain elderflower.  It was very good, and soon it was time to order another; Violeta ordered more of the Kir, and I, impressed that she found it so great to order it again, ordered one myself.  Unfortunately, I didn't find it as agreeable, so I asked if it could be replaced with a Bellini, instead.  No problem.  This version went down smoothly, albeit too smoothly (and way too fast!), as it was much sweeter than the elderflower.  For my third flute, I went back to my original choice (if only to make the drink last longer!).  Violeta and Andrea later tried the elderflower and liked it.

For our ""entree,"" I ordered the Prime Better Burger, cooked medium, while V. ordered the grilled cheese.  My burger was decadent: bottom layer consisted of 4 oz. prime burger w/ aged cheddar, and topped w/ 4 oz. shortrib, w/ garnishes of wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomato, and aioli.  Violeta's grilled cheese was equally wicked- slices of Granny Smith apples, bacon, and brie encased in toasted cranberry-walnut bread!  While I enjoyed my burger, I found it too indulgent; I'd definitely order the grilled cheese, in a heartbeat!

I think I was in the middle of finishing my entree when Andrea joined us, and may have offered her a bite, which she may have liked so much, that she ordered a burger for herself.  Such a shame that her burger, ordered medium, came out more on the rare side... I was able to talk Andrea into trying the arancini with me after failing miserably w/ Violeta :o  I thank the heavens Andrea played along, because the arancini was freakin' amazing!  Andrea and Brynn would agree!  A clear highlight of the evening.  Tonight's flavor was Marconi almond pesto.  The menu stated that the flavors change daily.  Cannot wait to return and try a new version!

For dessert, Violeta ordered a sorbet trio (which I thought was a bit on the safe side; I like rich desserts!), while I asked for banana creme pie.  Beautiful presentation!  What first struck me were the banana slices- these four pieces were given the torch treatment a la creme brulee.  Loved the amber color!  Then, the white and dark chocolate cigarettes propped onto the generous mound of toasted marshmallow!  Mmm... Every slice of the fork into the pie yielded a perfect ratio of mallow, banana cream, and graham cracker crust... Even the long, narrow river of chocolate sauce in the middle was just enough to add yet another level of exquisiteness to this dessert! If you like bananas, you owe it to yourself to visit soon and order this!  

What an amazing meal shared with fantastic women!  Thank you V and our new friends Andrea and Brynn!  To top the evening off, owner Robert sent us a round of late harvest Gewurtztraminer!  Funny, I was the only one who finished a pour...",2009-11-09 21:42:31

Maybe the fact that he has a show on TV where he runs around telling restaurant owners that the details are the thing people remember, made me more sensitive to the lack of attention in a restaurant with his name on it.

The three of us walked in without a reservation but we figured at 8:00 pm on a Wednesday it would be safe to assume we wouldn't have any problems finding a table. Our assumption was correct we walked in to find that half the place was finishing their meals and settling the bill. We were seated in a nice corner booth at the back of the restaurant, where almost every one had finished their meals. As we were waiting for our waiter to come take our order we had time to notice all the interesting little things from the old Laurier BBQ  that were still around. Things that definitely helped give Laurier Gordon Ramsey a nice look, the old tile floor from the 70's and the wood tables with cigarette burns are a nice touch and give the place a nice rustic feel. But as my friends and I were talking and laughing I started to notice the devil poking up from the details, all the trim pieces around the back of the long booth seat running along the wall looked like they were just throw in,  there were big holes between the boards making things look thrown together. I know I'm nitpicking but if your going to have a show where you nitpick about restaurant decor, yours needs to be above reproach and this is just one example among many little things.

Our waiter came to take our order and was very nice as well as helpful, the menu had a nice array of dishes to chose from, everything from typical rotisserie chicken to the crab and shrimp gidille, it was nice mix and there was something for everyone.  We ordered the half-chicken plate with mashed sweet potatoes, the grilled cheese with fries and the crab and shrimp sandwich also with fries. As we were waiting for our food to be brought out, we helped ourselves to some pickles from the jar on the table, hummm pickles. Our food arrived shortly after my last bite of pickle, I had ordered the shrimp and crab sandwich and have to say it was very good, the fries were OK but fries are a subjective thing I prefer the old style greasy fries these were a little too polished for my liking but good none the less. I tried a piece of the grill cheese and found it to be pretty good but nothing spacial I could have made the seam thing at home. I don't know about you but when I go out for dinner I want things to be better then I can make at home. The chicken looked and tasted like chicken you would get from St-Hubert BBQ , there are those details again. When I pay a premium for food I can get elsewhere for a better price I wanted it to be for more then just the name on the sign.

The service started off great but once our waiter had taken our order we never saw him again. The busboy brought us our food which is fine but he never came back to see if we wanted anything else. When it was time for desert we had to get a busboy to find our waiter and send him over, the restaurant at this point was almost completely empty and it wasn't that late, there's the devil again. The overall experience was good the food was good and the service wasn't great and the attention to detail was lacking and if your going to charge premium prices make sure it's for more then just the name on the sign. that's my two cents.",2011-11-19 13:35:35

Items from the regular menu are quite large so the CF offers a 'skinnylicious' menu, which just means that the portions are smaller.

I played it safe and went with my two favorite specialty rolls: the Philly Melt and the Hot Lava.

Fujo's Philly Melt is my favorite cream cheese roll I've ever had...it just melts in your mouth. Still, my very favorite overall is the Hot Lava roll. I swear, I would bath in the hot lava sauce if I could. Although not quite big enough to accommodate an adult male body, it is pretty huge and I've been known to dip other rolls in what's left over. 

I always tell myself to try some of the other specialty rolls but I can't bring myself to pass on my two faves...It might require me to develop a new allergy to shrimp or cream cheese.

UPDATE: Dined in for the first time yesterday. I arrived around 6:00 and there were only two couples there. Needless to say, I was seated immediately and was waited on by like 3 different people. The service was very good and very fast...I think they refilled my water like 5 times in the half hour I was there. 

I wanted to try some rolls I've never had, so I ordered the Tokyo, Godzilla, and Sunset rolls. The Tokyo roll was unique in that it was fried and then re-rolled in rice. The Godzilla roll was delicious but it was pretty similar to the Philly Melt, which I prefer because of the cream cheese. The Sunset roll was my favorite because of the yummy garlic sauce. By using a Groupon, I got all three rolls for less than $20 after tax and tip. Not bad at all!

UPDATE: Ordered the Magician's Roll, Cajun Roll, and the Panther Roll. Of the three, the Panther Roll was my favorite, which is hard for me to admit given that I'm a Giants fan and I hate Cam Newton. My least favorite was the Magician's Roll, although it did look pretty amazing with all the colorful caviar. I ordered the Cajun Roll because I've never had crawfish in sushi and the cajun spice sounded intriguing, but it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.",2016-03-10 14:04:52

The IWC I had been looking for was a somewhat rare and hard to find stainless Big Pilot with brown strap, I walked into the store and they had one. I was greeted at the IWC counter by a sales person. My biggest complaint about the salesperson was her lack of knowledge. I am by no means an expert on timepieces but I seemed to know more about the watch than she did. I asked her a few questions and about half of them she did not have the answer to and had to walk over to the person at the Rolex counter to ask them LOL. Sorry, but if you are trying to sell me a $15,000 watch you should be a bit more knowledgable about the product line. I was able to negotiate a very slight discount so I purchased the watch. Although I was fairly unimpressed with my sales persons knowledge I was very impressed with the stores inventory, I walked through he entire store and noticed many limited edition hard to find pieces. If there is a timepiece you are looking for this would be the place to contact to see if they have it in stock, thay carry all the big brands adn also have an estate section of nice used and refurbed pieces.",2013-05-22 20:02:12

We walked in to no one at the hostess stand and waited about 5 minutes before someone noticed and seated us. We then waited another 5-10 minutes before asking for a waitress. We had 3 different ones in the next 5 minutes asking is someone had taken our order. We ordered beers and waited another 5 minutes and one of them was delivered incorrectly. Our order was 6 boneless wings with fries, an iceberg wedge salad and a bowl of tortilla soup. We waited approximately 30 more minutes before the wings/fries were delivered. The waitress said that she asked for my salad to be redone because the lettuce did not look good (and it would be one minute). My soup was not brought out at that time. 20 minutes later after my tablemate had finished his food my soup and salad arrived - neither of which take a significant amount of preparation. It would've been fine but was told they were out of bowls so I got two cups of soup. Unfortunately one was lukewarm and the other was cold. We finally asked a passing waitress (not ours) to speak to the manager.

If any one of those things had happened, then I probably would've been fine. But all of those things happened and what we hoped was going to be a 30 minute meal turned into an hour and a half nightmare killing the rest of our night and errands. And the restaurant wasn't busy - the bar had some business but there were only about 5-6 tables with food patrons. One of the early waitresses said they were short staffed and we over heard them asking another waitress to bus tables. The only reason why this is getting 2 stars is because the manager did comp my food.

I was fortunate enough to grow up with many polish neighbours most of my life and had the pleasure of sampling traditional Polish home cooking for over 20 years. Cafe Polonez destroyed everything I previously sampled in the past.

The restaurant looks great, very European with beautiful artwork. Service was excellent with three female servers handling the whole restaurant with military precision. (The servers all appeared to be Polish or Eastern European) 

Interesting Polish beer selections with 8-10 unique Polish beers I never tried before (in bottle or on tap). I tried 3 different beers and all were enjoyable The beer is rather smooth and easy to drink (hence the 3 beers). Most tables were enjoying a beer with their meals. 

Now on to the food. I recommend the combo platters for one, two or four - a great way to sample the different types of Polish specialties. Portions were generous and priced fairly. A giant platter for two was $35. The standouts included:

- Best cabbage rolls ever!!!!! OMG, I had the biggest smile on my face as I savoured every bite. I panicked when mine was gone and I seriously considered stealing my fellow Yelpers only roll. This is a must try. The rice/meat stuffing is incredible.

- Perogies were killer and offered with a variety of fillings (everything from basic potato / cheese to sauerkraut). You can even get frozen ones to bring home with you.

- Schnitzel was also amazing, better than the Austrian and German versions of this dish in my opinion (and I'm German). The pork was so tender and the batter not nearly as greasy. It was covered in sautéd mushrooms.

- Potato pancakes were another standout. Not healthy but these deep fried potato pancakes just melted in your mouth. Add sour cream and be happy!

- The platters come with cole slaw, sauerkraut, beet and carrot salads which acted as nice palette refresher between main dishes.   

European home cooking at it's best. You feel like your in Poland eating at the home of a friendly local. I only wish I didn't live so far away..... but I would consider moving to be closer to this place.  
   
Tip - It's a block or two away from the Popular Barque, come here instead of waiting in line for BBQ.

The portions, at least the fries, are generous.  A regular order of fries is plenty for 2 people.  

The burgers, however, are just a little bland and messy.  They fall apart in my hands every time.   The regular burgers are also just too large and I'm not a small guy.  I always get the little burger and find I'm forcing the last bits down.

Taro, Azuki Bean, Black Sesame with Mochi in a house made Waffle Bowl

A surprisingly under recognized shop given their nearly 17 years in the local market, Mixers Ice Cream & Boba had been on my 'to try' list ever since I heard that each of their thirty-plus ice creams or gelatos were made in house and with an extensive day of eating already behind me plus two slices of cake from Jerry's serving as 'dinner' there seemed no better way to round out the evening than with a sundae - no less one consisting of traditional Chinese flavors topped with house made mochi in a fresh baked waffle bowl.  A small shop cleverly appointed with cutesy décor and a few traditional packaged candies to go along with an extensive list of boba, frozen confections, waffles, ice cream cakes, and even French fries it was to a small line that I arrived and after a short wait what followed can only be described as plethoric tasting session including sweet cream, butter pecan, jackfruit, lychee, cake batter, cheesecake, ginger, Thai tea, and more before settling on a traditional trio of Taro and Azuki Bean Ice Creams plus Black Seasame Gelato, a scoop of mochi and a spritz of whipped cream adding texture and the entirety of the amalgam impressively well flavored without being overly saccharine in the least.  Perhaps not as 'trendy' as Snowflake - though also serving snow ice - or esoteric as Art of Flavors - though with a much more extensive menu - and featuring lovely service in a pleasant setting there is no doubt in my mind that this will not be my last visit to Mixers; the avocado boba smoothie, red velvet waffle sundae, ice cream cake pops, and churros are all calling.",2014-01-23 03:36:57

The lobster roll was okay, the meat was very fresh tasting, I'll give them that. But man, the bread it was sandwiched in was so greasy, honestly felt like they drenched it in butter and toasted it very slowly on the pan. The portion of the lobster roll?

Since no one bothered to ask us how our experience was, I thought I would post and maybe someone who cares would see it.

First of all, I do want to mention the hostess.  When we entered, she was slumped in a perfect attitude of 20-something boredom.  Then we got seated near the hostess station and DH said---my back was to her---that she was just staring at our table, but he said it was a somewhat blank stare, so he thinks she was just out of it or stoned.  Then, near the end of our meal, the busboy joined her and they both stood at this rail near the door and again---close enough to our table it was uncomfortable.  When we left the table, we hadn't even taken three steps and they descended like locusts to clean up.  I would suggest management needs to find both kids something to do when not occupied with serving guests.

However, our server was awesome, except that he never asked us how our food was.  I have a feeling he knew what I was going to say, so he didn't ask.  But he was on top of everything and did a great job.

We shared a house salad with blue cheese and it was very good.  Fresh, not imaginative, but nice and fresh.  Then DH ordered the Blackened BBQ hamburger and regular fries.  I ordered fish and chips with sweet potato fries.   DH raved about his burger and fries and I tasted them and they WERE good.  The fries were so hot when first delivered they almost burnt the roof of my mouth!  My food was cold.  Seriously.  Do you know how disgusting cold fish and chips and limp sweet potato fries are? And I couldn't ask for them to be warmed up because you know what a microwave does to fried food.  And a re-fire and DH would have been eating cold food, cause he would have delayed eating his meal so we could eat together.

He brought us some bread and breadsticks along with perhaps the most delicious pesto I've ever had. Then we started with the beef carpaccio appetizer ($8.99); the beef was solid, and the parmesan cheese slices were to die for. 

For dinner, I got the pork chop ($18.99). He didn't ask how I wanted it cooked, which generally means it's going to be overcooked... and it was. The baked apple it came with was divine though, and the asparagus was so fresh.

As stated, they have superb dish choices each week. They do seafood/fish surprisingly well. The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up.

The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one.

Once again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means ""nice"", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.

For dinner, I went all out with the surf and turf.  A NY Strip, medium rare and half a 3lb lobster.  This was as good or perhaps even better than any other strip I've had in town.  Almost butter knife tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked to the perfect temp.  Lobster was good just cause lobster IS good but there was nothing overly remarkable here.  Sweetie opted for the chicken parmigiana which was also a huge portion so there is half of that in the fridge too.  It was delicious and the marinara makes the dish.

Dessert was a shared fresh berries and creme anglais.  5 stars here for the perfectly chilled raspberries, blackberries and strawberries and a just sweet enough creme to dip them in.

Service was friendly, professional and not too stuffy the way it can feel at some other high end steakhouses in town.  She recommended a very good bottle of Pinot Noir at a reasonable price point which was a nice addition to the meal.

Expensive?  Ummmmm, yes.  If you eat as described above you will be closing in on 3 bills, pre-tip.  BUT.... There are other options to choose that are much less expensive should you want to not blow up the Visa too badly and I am quite sure they are prepared just as well.  A definite come back to place for us despite the haul from LKN.",2012-03-17 12:25:30

It was easy for me to get a seat at the bar although it was a solid 10 minutes before I got attention from a bartender. To no fault of theirs really, but I tried two local Nevada IPA drafts and they were both mediocre.

For dinner I had the fried chicken meal with a spicy honey sauce on the side. For their signature item, I was pretty disappointed. The chicken itself was warm and tasted alright, but it just wasn't crispy. Seemed to be a big flaw in my book. I ate the whole plate but left feeling underwhelmed.",2015-10-14 00:37:35

They truly are.


BUT --- 

I just find it really ... expensive, for what it is. 
I wouldn't be so nit-picky about the $$ if I thought this stuff was being made by hand but you can see the huge machines in the back.  
I (literally) live around the corner from here, and while it's a special treat I don't pop in regularly because of the prices. Based on the other reviews, I don't even think about picking up lunch not knowing how much it might end up costing.

1/2 doz bagels - $4
Half a loaf of banana bread $4.25 

I love the bagels and baked goods. (but then again, they're the only thing I've tried there).
They're all baked fresh on location, so the chances of picking up a still-warm croissant are high -- the almond croissants are incredible, and I'm not normally a fan of the croissant. The almond croissant is a very fair $2.95. 

The Ruggalach are sold by weight, and they have a few interesting flavors, including chocolate and sugar free fruit preserve variety. 
 

The staff seem a bit stunned.
I was there opening week, and I understood the chaos and having no idea what to do etc .. but the feeling hasn't changed. Even today, the girl at the cash seemed frazzled, dazed and confused.

Their were far more interactive displays and exhibits than I was expecting. It kept the attention of our whole family as we wound from room to room.

She apologized but by that time I was really hungry and had to get back to work so I needed to eat the dish. Basically it was TONS of noodles and lettuce/cilantro but very little of anything else. I found the dish underwhelming.  I waited another 10 minutes to get the second half of my meal,  by then I just ate alone and not on top of the dish. 

My server never came back so  eventually I just went up to the front to ask if I could pay. There wasn't any language barriers or issues like that, and the place was not very busy. Unfortunately i just think it was poor service...

We had the ahi tuna for dinner and who doesn't want something served on a potato pancake! Delicious!

And for dessert (it was a birthday celebration after all) we had the apple bread pudding. What a wonderful combination of flavors.

Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew. 

I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a ""healthy"" flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able. 

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.

We still purchased a bottle of wine, a French Merlot, Nicholas for $34 at full price on top of the food covered by the groupon. We were seated right away, they had a good crowd going in the back of the restaurant. I guess it makes it easy on the servers. There were about 10-13 other tables dining at the same time. Our server, was ok, she should have mentioned the limit one deal per table much earlier than she did. We ordered the seasonal risotto with shrimp, $18, and the bf got the basil penne with chicken, $16. 

I love the complimentary bread that's brought out at the beginning, it makes me want to buy a whole baguette before I leave. Very fresh and soft on the inside, yet perfectly crunchy on the outside, just the way a French baguette should be. I prefer Café Monte's baguettes over Amelie's . The food was brought out surprisingly fast, it was not the case last time we were here. My risotto was generously dressed with tender shrimp, loved it, and a copious amount of veggies. The zucchini and mushrooms came out perfectly. It had a balanced, creamy yet flavorful taste. It was a good sized portion, I only left a little risotto standing on the plate when I was done. The penne was also good, need a little more seasoning but it had a generous amount of chicken and pesto cream sauce. Bill came to $37 after the Groupon was applied due to the full priced wine bottle, eh, will keep the 1 promotion per table in mind for next time.

I shared the fried dill pickles with apricot sauce.... and it was so good! That sauce was great and I used the remaining on my burger. I ended up getting the Official Counter Burger. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The mushrooms and onions strings were good. The beef was cooked the way I like it as well. However, the bun was just too buttery for me. It overpowered the taste of anything else. I like when buns are buttered, but this was too much. I wish I had a chance to get a shake or malt, because that part of the menu looked amazing.

We arrived around 1:30 PM and was met with a mob scene. First there was a long line to park, then it was a long line to just get in. It's best to buy tickets online to avoid the 2 hour wait to get one. Once you have your ticket, getting in is a little easier, but still a wait.

When we got inside, there was another long line to get tokens to buy tacos and drinks. This put a slight damper on the experience and should have been managed better. 

The lines for tacos weren't too horrible as there were 40+ restaurants serving tacos. I personally enjoyed them all and didn't mind that they were $2 each. We also had fun checking out a chihuahua dressed in a taco who was being entered into a costume contest. We also got a chance to get into the luchador ring to pretend we were mean wrestlers!

We got here about 1 PM for a late lunch and it was perfect timing as the lunch crowd was already leaving and there were only about 3 other tables being served. We were all hungry and didn't know what to expect.

We were not prepared for the culinary heaven we were about to experience.

OMG. OMG. OMG.

We started with an appetizer called Dad""s Grocery Bag which was served on a cutting board and had a ciabatta loaf, artisan cheeses, cured meats,  country olives and mixed nuts. The bread was warm, the cheese rich and meats robust. We pretty much inhaled this appetizer and were ready for what we really came for and that was for the Carolina Baby Back ribs. 

Two of us ordered ribs and my hubby ordered the Tri Tip Sandwich. The ribs came two different ways I ordered the full rack of ribs that came with the shoestring fries, my friend, the half of rack of ribs with the roasted chicken, asparagus and coleslaw. Let me first start with the  Try Tip Sandwich. Once my hubby saw our orders, it was game over. While he enjoyed his sandwich, he said it was an 8/10 he was agreed that these ribs were one of the best ribs we've come across. 

Like I said, GAME OVER, these ribs fell off the bone every so slightly without any effort. The ribs also had the BBQ sauce spread out evenly and nicely (not too heavy, not too light) and had just the delicate balance of spices and sweetness. The portions were huge, I felt guilty having a whole rack of ribs in front of me, after 2 bites, I so didn't want to share these ribs with anyone. Not even my beautiful husband. But sadly, he talked his way into eating half of my rack. Now folks these ribs were so good, that we decided to just forgo our manners and not try to use our forks and knives to get the meat off. After the 3rd rib, we just started picking them up and yes, we used our hands at a white table restaurant. After all, there were hardly any people there.

I enjoyed each and every rib and savored the experience. All three of us agreed that this was the most perfectly cooked rack of ribs we've ever tasted. As far as the shoestring fries and coleslaw, the fries were lightly salted, nicely cooked and tender. The coleslaw was just right, not too mayo tasting and looked like a really healthy salad.

But we weren't done...

When we found out that the key lime pie and the brownie were homemade, we had no choice but to order it. Why not right? We already polished off 1.5 rack of ribs, beautiful bread, artisan cheeses and prosciutto. 

The key lime pie was perfect. Not too sweet, not to tart and the crust and filling melted in your mouth. The brownie was excellent, moist and not too sweet. The portions of both the desserts were for sharing, which means between the three of us we only ate half of each portion.

All in all service was great, friendly and attentive. So with the specialty ice teas, 1 appetizer, 3 lunch entrees and 2 desserts, the lunch was about $140 with tip. Not too bad for a piece of heaven.

And if you're wondering if we'll be returning here the answer is YES. YES. YES.

Probably not much. But, because you adore me, I'm going to throw in my opinion anyway. You're welcome.

I first encountered China Chili while it was still operating at it's doomed Central Avenue location. Of course it wasn't doomed due to bad food, lousy service or any other detriment other than the light rail project's existence. So, it moved. 

After about 9 months it's back and ready to serve some of the best Chinese food in town. I've yet to venture to the part of the menu that offers duck, but I've tried several beef, chicken and pork dishes and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy. 

The dining room is wide open. No booths. All tables. The volume can get a little loud when there are many patrons, and there usually... there are many patrons.  

One thing that sets them apart from other Chinese places I've tried is the way that some of the chicken dishes are prepared. Typically, little bites of chicken are battered, fried and covered in sauce. At China Chili, the entire cut of chicken is battered, THEN sliced and covered in sauce. This makes it visually more appealing and you aren't consuming so much batter and grease.

I'll be back many times in the future so I can get my Chili on.",2007-01-19 23:52:51

My husband and I are sushi lovers and are always trying new sushi restaurants. We traveled 40 minutes from Surprise to try this out. We were disappointed.

The rice they use is black/purple and DOES NOT taste like sushi rice. It doesn't taste right and it makes the rolls taste abnormal. At every sushi restaurant, we always make sure we get the rainbow roll to gauge the quality of their raw fish.Their raw fish is okay.. definitely not great quality, but not the worst either.

If you love rolls with lots of sauce, then this place is for you. I, personally, don't like TOO MUCH sauce on my specialty rolls... just a little is enough for me. But they DRENCH those suckers so much that all you taste is sauce with weird black/purple rice. 

There DINNER MENU is very small... and does NOT include bento boxes. All they have are rolls, sashimi, ramen, and the typical appetizers. Their LUNCH menu, on the other hand, have bento boxes.

Last but not least, the PRICE is a little more than what I'm used to for the same quality. The ""SPECIAL"" we were offered for uni/sea urchin was $5 per ONE piece. That's a little expensive. I can get good uni/sea urchin at ""Sushi Catcher"" for $8 per TWO large pieces.

However, I've ended up at Urban Cookies a few times now and always find myself wondering, why am I wasting precious, precious stomach space on these when I could just trek on over to LGO's bakery and go nuts?

I respect them conceptually and appreciate the idea of a gourmet cookie, but when it comes to the actual product, I'm not buying it (figuratively, because literally I already bought it, of course).

I love the location close to the Sunnyside C-Train station, and the building itself has great memories for me (cinnamon buns from Heartland Cafe were my second-year university hangover cure!).  Now, it's a little bit more upscale, and managed by the folks who also bring us Teatro, a downtown restaurant.

When I entered there were three people ahead of me in line.  It took them quite a while to make up their mind (""What do you mean I can't get a half order of French toast?"") and pay.  That gave me lots of time to check out the menu and decide on the marinated beet salad.  It advertised red and golden beets, Fairwinds Farm goat cheese, and ""artisan greens"" or something.  I placed my order and asked for a slice of focaccia as well.  The girl looked a bit confused and said, ""Do you want a side of toast?""  I don't usually think of focaccia as being toast, so I just said, ""Whatever it takes to get a piece of focaccia with my salad.""  She confirmed that it would be a side of toast.  As a drink I had some of their homemade lemonade (there's a strange price and size differential between to stay and to go lemonades, though in retrospect I think the extra four ounces for twenty cents actually gets you four extra ounces of ice).  I got my lemonade and my number, and took a seat.  As it was often hard to get seated at Heartland Cafe, I was pleased to see Vendome had additional seating.

So I sat, and I sat.  For more than fifteen minutes, actually.  I don't know what they were doing in the kitchen- growing the beets from seed?  Other people who came after me were served before me, and the clock ticked on.  Luckily I was not in a hurry, but I don't think twenty minutes is a reasonable amount of time to wait for a salad and side of toast in a not-busy cafe.  When my salad came it looked good, although a bit small, and I was glad I had ordered the ""toast"" too.  The salad had small pieces of beets, a few slivers of raw zucchini, pieces of carrot, two or three pieces of cherry tomato, a little bit of goat cheese and some ""artisan greens"" (is it official that ""artisan greens"" = ""Earthbound Farms Spring Mix""?).  It was good, but not big enough to be filling.  The focaccia was unusually thin, and the toasting had dried it out.  I lived in Italy for several years and I'm not sure this would have passed any Italian's ""focaccia test"".  It came with a little pot of something... considering it was served with a savoury salad I'd hoped it was tomato chutney or something, but it was actually berry jam.  Good for breakfast, not really appropriate with my  lunch.  

Overall the meal was passable, but not memorable.  I would return again and give something else on the menu a try, but it won't be a top lunch stop for me.",2011-07-10 00:40:36

So, we arrived and were seated with only a short wait - and the waiting area had lots of very comfy seats so it wasn't much of an inconvenience at all.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, with the standard Tuscan paint scheme.

Our servers arrived (one was apparently being trained).. though our waiter didn't introduce himself, the receipt said his name was Rhett so I'll just assume his trainee was Scarlett.  They were very friendly and helpful, and we ordered our meals.

Firstly, our beverages and their bread selection arrived.. the bread was good.  Then our appetizer arrived, the Duetto Toscano Tuscan Dips.  I had a bit of each, thought they were both good but the Chorizo Fonduta was the best of the two.  Hubby, however, went nuts and cleared the rest of the platter... yes, he loved them both quite a lot.. though he gave extra points to the same dip.  The chilled Pepper Formagio was good, just needed something more.. not sure what.

Just a note.. the over-attentive staff was incredibly prompt at grabbing empties off our table, keeping it clear.  Definite kudos to them for this.

Now, for the entrees.. mine was the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto..absolutely fantastic.  The blend of flavors & textures was incredible, it was a delight.  Hubby's meal, the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca, got rave reviews from hubby though it was overcooked and had to be redone.  No, I didn't taste it.. gorgonzola is evil.  They put mine on a warmer for the duration or replaced it, I have no clue which it was.  He also got the Lobster Bisque which was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.

His side dishes, the mashed potatoes and vegetables, were not particularly noticable.

Now, with the food being good, the service being fantastic, and the ambiance/decor being nice.. why only 3 stars?  Because it was COLD in there, to the point of teeth chattering, stuffed-up noses, shivering bodies.. and I was wearing jeans, a sweater, and sneakers.. clothing that should keep me warm enough in winter, let alone early September.  I only ate a few bites of my meal and had them package it up to bring home.. where I could actually enjoy the food instead of suffering through it.  And, though I complained many times (and they admitted that they were aware of the problem), nothing was done.

Additionally, the food was becoming rapidly chilled and cold risotto is not a good thing.

Perhaps the rest of the food isn't that good and they want people to dull their tastebuds with stuffed-up sinuses?  I have no clue, but I know that I was beyond thrilled when we finally left.  And yes, I had even gone outside during the recooking phase just so I could thaw out a bit, only to have it all undone when I returned.

So.. it was good food, good service, but I doubt if I'll ever want to return there again.. not without Uggs, a parka, and a warming plate for the food.  Overall experience.. miserable.",2011-09-14 22:58:18

Given their stated commitment to using local produce, I assume that at least some of the vegetables were locally grown, but I didn't ask.

The pizza was very good, but at $12, it was quite pricey for its size (somewhere around a typical pizza place's ""small"" size). The lunch menu in general runs about $8 to $12, though, so they're not meant to be ultra-cheap like a lot of the other places in Oakland.

We found out about this driving range through Groupon - which is a great deal for the 150 balls you get. Although you don't have real greens and tees it is kind of novel having the balls automatically fed to you. 

As I mentioned we visited .. twice.. well the first visit a very windy sand storm rolled through and luckily this place has great shelter for that unpredictable monsoon season we get here. 

We had to stop hitting halfway through because the weather got so bad, chairs were being hurled, along with the putting mats. The staff were really reasonable and gave us vouchers for the unused balls for another visit.

We did come back a couple of days later to continue hitting more balls. The upstairs area didn't have their fans and misting systems going - so we stayed downstairs again. This is a great place to practice your swing for sure. Staff is great, bathrooms are ok (a little dated), and they have a big shop for all your golfing needs. 

Sometimes real greens are nicer, but relatively hard to keep up in this climate. Where I do notice a big difference in real vs turf was their putting green. The putting green runs incredibly fast and is nearly unplayable. The artificial turf is unnaturally short and works similar to putting on concrete.

Rolls were served 4 pieces to a order. 

We got salmon skin roll ($2.75) - decent,  but standard. I like the beet butterfly they did as garnish - pretty. 

Hawaiian roll (around $5.25) - pretty decent again, but standard. It has spicy tuna, wrapped in various fish with ponzu. 

It didnt seem happy hour was much of a deal generally, there were a few items on major discount. It can make for good variety since its half rolls but once you add up 2x orders its close to the normal roll price. Theres no happy hour menu or mention of it on their site, but its a select menu of alcohol, rolls, and some appetizers on special. The sake bombs were a good deal though, I believe $3.

At this point we decide going with a dinner bento is probably best than going all happy hour.  

We shared a 3 item combo -

*Albacore sashimi (5pc) - it was pretty fresh actually,  no complaints there.
*Tonkatsu - nicely crisp, it was a bit dry. 
*Spicy chicken - was Korean style with onions, zucchini, and chicken in a spicy sauce. It wasn't too spicy though but it was flavorful.  

Miso soup and salad that comes with is again, decent but standard fare. 

Service was fairly decent. 

Its not bad but its not great. I would say it was all pretty average Americanized Japanese.  I think if thats what you were craving you can probably find a good meal here. I guess with the reviews I was expecting something more.",2013-08-11 22:12:10

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.

Chaska is a new restaurant that has opened close to our office. My colleague called to ask whether the place was open. Yes! It closes at 9 pm on Thursdays. 

We walked over there, which took roughly five minutes. I don't recall what business was there before Chaska,!but Chaska is between Subway and Pita Lite. 

You basically pick and choose what you'd like to eat. I went with the chicken tikka with brown rice, medium curry sauce, and a Diet Pepsi. My colleague and I didn't discuss what we wanted, but he ordered the same meal! You can tell that we work so closely together that our food tastes are the same. 

Our manager ordered the salmon salad with a mango lassi. 

My food was delicious. The chicken was tender. The medium curry sauce was spicier than I had anticipated, but was flavourful. 

The decor is trendy and cheerful. I loved the lighting. There are plenty of tables. 

I'd come back here for a quick, delicious meal. You can order out, too.

My best friend wanted to celebrate her last day in the QC dining at a place that had a stellar view of the skyline so she chose PR. She made dinner reservations for the rooftop on Tuesday (8-30-16). I showed up early and was immediately seated and provided menus. Zack, our waiter, was awesome and answered all of our questions about the drinks and food. Draft beer and bottles of wine were half-priced so we both went with beer. I had the DELICIOUS shoffhoffer (sp?) grapefruit that was on tap.

We both went with burgers: I chose the aloha burger with fries and my friend went with the ghost pepper burger (minus the ghost pepper) with Brussels sprouts (per the waiter's suggestion). Our food came out and I was kinda disappointed. The flavors of the aloha burger were very underwhelming. I could barely tell that I ordered anything other than a regular burger because I couldn't taste anything resembling what was in the burger's description. Also, I kept thinking how this place should take advantage of providing seasonal menus. Like, why on earth are they serving anything with squash during the warmer/hotter months?

I love going to Garcias. It is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Arizona. They have great fajitas and a fantastic happy hour. The bean dip has slipped some, it used to be much tastier but it is still pretty good. Great margaritas and normally great service. The outside seating is also very nice. I would recommend Garcia's to anyone who wants good Mexican food!


Update....

We just recently celebrated my sisters 30th birthday here. We came out for happy hour so we were able to deal with the whole family being there :) We requested outside patio because it was such a large group and we were interested in the happy hour. We had grandparents that ""couldn't handle the heat"" so they allowed us to eat inside and still get happy hour prices.

When I read the yelp reviews, I was pleasantly surprised they have other form of Brazilian restaurant and this one just opened early this year.

Dipping sauce went well with fried yuca. It reminded of Peruvian food I had before.

For lunch, I had Bobo De Camarao - shrimp dish.  Shrimp was in a puree of yuca and coconut milk, and I tasted the hint of coconut milk and I thought I could just eat this sauce with rice only.

For desert, I shared the Brazilian Flan. The texture was between Mexican flan and New York Cheese cake, was a little harder than I anticipated but really enjoyed the flan with caramel sauce.

Enter My Fit Foods...

My husband started picking up some meals and snacks from MFF sometime within the last 10 months.  We've actually given them a ton of business, and I'm sure will continue to do so considering we enjoy the quality of their food, the portion sizes, convenience, the service, etc... oh yeah - and the fact that they are healthy too!

Sure, it can be pricey, and I advise only purchasing what you know you'll eat within a few days.  We've had a few instances where the food sits too long and goes past expiration date and goes to waste.  But, when you plan ahead, MFF really is fabulous.

Some of our favorite dishes:
*Breakfast: protein pancakes and oat bakes - our toddler loves the pancakes and I love the oat bakes!

*Lunch / Dinner: I enjoy most of the salmon and chicken dishes.  The cobb and/or greek salads aren't bad either.  My husband is also a fan of Denyse's Killuh Chili; I have yet to try it though.

*Snacks: almond butter crunch / fit-to-go

Even though I'm a CBC, and prefer non-Chinese food, after 3 days of heavy eating, chowing down on one's grass roots is a natural phenomena--I think lol.

So during my many frequents back and forth Paris/Ballys/Planet Hollywood, and passing by YKS and their super long lineups, my first initial glance is, 'nah, made for westerners, I can eat this stuff at home'...

Eventually curiosity got the better of me, and despite the high prices (which I can accept, it's vEgas, it's our crappy Canadian dollar), I just have to try it out.  Besides, mostly Asians were eating here, probably for the same reason lol.

First off, the veggies were great.  Bak choy at this stage, my body needs it.

Wonton noodle, pretty decent too.  And the broth wasn't as loaded with MSG as to be expected.

Roast duck, pieces-wise adequate in itself, and we're not exactly in Chinatown, so for $18, whatever.

now, we were totally impressed by the service, spoke Cantonese a few times.

Unlike other restaurants, it's OKAY to order just cold water--what's even cooler, is that they topped up a few times too.

Liked the picnic style seating along the wall.

Yes, long lineups as usual everywhere, and honestly, not worth the wait if you're short on time.

But a nice change.",2015-12-31 09:49:33

Based on all the good reviews, I was hoping for a good-to-great experience, but it ended up being a mediocre-to-bad experience. 

It started off poorly with the hostess saying I could sit at the bar but she held up a finger as she took a phone call. So I waited. After about 30 seconds, when it was clear that it wasn't going to be a quick phone call, I motioned walking to the bar and she just shrugged her shoulders. So I walked over to the bar area and sat down. 

I waited for several moments and nobody came by. Eventually the hostess walked over and said my server would be with me soon. After another minute, a woman walks up and asks if I want water. I say yes and ask if she's my server, and she says no and leaves. Shortly, a guy walks up and asks if I want water. I say I already requested water and ask if he is my server. He says no, pours my water, and walks away. A little bit after that, another guy walks up and asks if I want to order a drink. I ask if he's my server, and he says yes. I ask if I can order food, and he acts surprised and says, ""but you just sat down!"" (I don't know why that matters, since I could already know what I want to order even if I had just sat down.) I explain that I've been waiting for a while and have had plenty of time to look through the menus. 

I had originally wanted to try the tasting menu, but I happened to be in the area during happy hour, so I thought I'd try a few of their happy hour menu items. I ordered the happy hour versions of the Caesar salad, meatball, and ravioli of the day. 

The food came out relatively quickly. The Caesar salad was watery and didn't taste like a Caesar salad at all. There was no flavor. The meatball was good. The ravioli had flavor, but was too salty. 

Getting my check took a while too, as did getting change. I had to ask two different people for the check and three different people whether I was getting my change. 

Factoring in the mediocre food and bad service in light of my expectations given the good Yelp reviews, I don't really have anything positive to say about this restaurant. Which is really too bad, because I was hoping I could find a new favorite Italian restaurant near my home.",2017-07-22 02:10:09

No thai tea flavor at all =( I also tried their black sesame, but noted that there was only a light sesame flavor.

I emailed the manager in the morning to let him know that we would be coming to the cafe and could we have our meal comped, he responded immediately and let us know to notify Adam Warren, the manager at the cafe that morning and everything would be taken care of and it was! Both Adam and the waitress were very inviting and friendly and made us feel welcome, acknowledging our complaint on our last visit.I did notice that the hostess that was there the last time we came was also there along with another hostess, both of them are not very customer-oriented and I feel that is the only problem that Cafe 87 isn't realizing, your front of house is your first impression and the most important one. Both of them were not engaged with customers, standing around looking at the television, when we left, both hostesses were leaning and sitting near the entrance talking to each other, not acknowledging us when we came in or when we left. I did mention this to Adam. Otherwise, everything was wonderful, the food, the service and we will let you know, you have officially redeemed yourselves, thank you, you will see us again soon.

They charge $13 for the special (dac biet) while other places charge around $9-$10. Yes, those few dollars do matter to me. But let me tell you, those few dollars are so worth it because Tan Lac Vien has the best bowl of pho you'll find in Pittsburgh!

My husband and I came here on a whim on a bitter cold day, figuring pho would warm us up. What I really like about this place is that it has a rather large Vietnamese menu, not just pho, although I couldn't bring myself to try anything else when the weather outside was in the single digits. We ordered the veggie spring rolls, and pho for each of us. The spring rolls came out on a large plate atop a variety of veggies (lettuce, cucumber, carrot, cilantro and basil), which can be used to roll up your rolls in, despite it looking like garnish. I really like that they serve it up with these veggies because it reminds me of how my mom serves her spring rolls: with a plate of greens for wrapping. Taste-wise, they were good but I would much prefer the full flavor from the pork spring rolls. But for $5 for two pork spring rolls, that's a bit steep when you only get about 2-3 bites out of one. And for the star of the show, the pho was the closest to my mom's I've ever had. The portion was large, the broth was clear and aromatic, and it didn't make me super thirsty afterwards (=little to no MSG, yay!). The meat wasn't as plentiful as I would like but it was enough to fill me, so no complaints.

The space is rather small, and the layout is a bit strange with two tables in the front of the restaurant and more tables in the back. Service was very good as several waitresses came by to assist us, without ever repeating questions. It's like they all talked to each other and knew what was taken care of and what was not. Overall, I really enjoyed Tan Lac Vien and I would definitely like to come back to try the other menu items!",2016-02-16 00:49:24

I love the pork fried rice (some of the best fried rice Ive ever had, kinda sweet from the BBQ pork in it), the black beans (some of the best black beans Ive ever had) the jade red chicken and the carnita's quesadilla's. The BBQ Sweet pork is pretty good as well. And the snickerdoodles cookies and chocolate volcano cookies are da bomb. A couple dishes I am not impressed with at Chino: The egg foo young, the chili relleno (had crushed saltines on it which I was not keen on), and the gringo chicken (kinda dry and bland). 
The price is decent although it recently went up. The owners are the nicest people and the staff is always pretty friendly. The decor and ambiance is a little strange with the folding tables, cheap chairs and not much decor on the walls. However, I was told by the owner at one point that they keep it that way so they can keep the food and everything cheaper. They have been improving on this lately with painting the walls and tiling in the crappy little round putting green that was by the backdoor. 
I still like this place very much. Here is a story to tell you how much I like Chino. One time, I got water from the drink dispenser. I was sitting there stirring it around with my straw when I noticed something. Upon further inspection, it was a dead cricket. Pretty dam gross. I was disgusted that I didnt go back to Chino for about a year. Then I started to miss it. So I went back, just dont get a drink anymore. Haha. I do wish that I could go there again and have the food be fresh and wonderful like it once was. Its still good though and I will still go when I get my occasional chino craving.

I arrived during Sunday Brunch, and opted to sit at the bar, since I was dining by myself.  I ordered the veggie quinoa ($14), add shrimp ($5).   I thought the price point was a little bit high for quinoa, seeing as though I could have gotten a burger and fries for about $12, but didn't really see anything else on the menu that I had a taste for.  My entree arrived a short time later, and just as I expected, the portion was small, but adequate, and way over-priced at $19.  I would suggest, a side of mixed greens perhaps, to accompany the entree.  After seeing the portion, I ordered a side of sourdough toast ($3), which was very good.  Now back to the entree, decent portion of warm, white quinoa, with seasonal vegetables which included, LOTS of zuchhini, a few mushrooms, some onion.  There were also cranberries mixed in, I could have done without the sweet component, just didn't need it.  I also would have loved a larger variety of veggies, maybe some carrots, sundried tomatoes, broccolli, or cauliflower.  The entree was tasty, but my final bill was close to $30 with tip and the only beverage that I had was ice water.

I got to try Cowbell today for brunch.  Though it was around 12:30, I was surprised to see the restaurant was pretty empty.  Coming from the land of Leslieville, I'm used to ridiculous line ups for any weekend brunch spot; instead here, we were invited to choose our table.   A nice change of pace!  

Immediately, I liked the interior of the restaurant.  It was homey without being over the top kitschy.  Our server came over immediately and took our drink order - two $6 caesars to begin with - yummy!  While we waited for our drinks, we took time looking over the chalkboard menu.  It was a tough call because so much looked good.  I finally decided on the smoked ham and five year cheddar quiche with frisee salad with walnuts, and a side order of bacon to share.  My partner had another caesar, and the tongue sandwich with a hen egg and kale, and I had a coffee.

While we were waiting, we were privy to a musical battle between the kitchen staff and the servers.  At first it was kind of funny, but the constant changing of songs got annoying fast.  Afrobeat to Joni Mitchell to Radiodread... like it all but leave one on already!

I have to say, the quiche was pretty good, but it was cold in the middle which turned me off.  Also, I may not be a botanist, but I'm pretty sure the leafy green that made up my salad was kale.  I like kale, but uncooked, it was pretty tough, so I passed on it.  The bacon and the hen egg were very good though, I must say.

- i will have to come back. why? because i didnt have the soon tofu. and it's the house of it, for pete's sake!!
- instead, i tried the pork bone soup. i think it may have been an off night, because it was not as rock solid as i thought it was going to be. maybe the abundance of peppercorns ruined the experience for me. when i say peppercorns, i'm not joking around. i feel like a pepper mill dumped on, and not in the nice garnish sort of way, but a hailstorm.... 
- i dont want to let one dish throw off my review. 
- the place was your typical joint in k-town. nice and polite service from foreign exchange students, clean and bright atmosphere, not pretentious in the slightest, and rammed full of korean folks (good sign of great food).

Dishes here are never too salty, too sweet or too spicy.

Now, forgetting about price, the food is fantastic. If you enjoy dumplings, and a variety of northern Chinese cuisine you will not be disappointed with the taste.

My top 3 dishes to try:

Inside out fish (deep fried sweet n sour crispy fish) - incredibly tasty, with great crisp and generous portion size.
If u like sweet n sour pork or general Tao chicken, this is better than both AMYWHERE.

Soup filled dumplings - larger than most places, with more meat and soup, but the flavours are unmatched anywhere else! I challenge you to find better dumplings.

Dessert dish: sweet glutinous soup thingy (dunno name but it has goji berries, egg, rice and mochi I think) 

Reason for the 4 stars: everything is fantastic, great location with two entrances one onto midland and one onto finch,  but some dishes are overpriced.

The inside out fish is $37 for a plate...which hurts, but u definitely should try this dish at least once. We still order it everytime we go because it's that good, but don't think it warrants the price of a succulent steak at top end steak joints..

Also a bit small on space so I recommend reserving ahead of time and going with at least 5 people to share the bill and try more dishes!",2015-06-28 00:19:57

If you are new here and still unaware, this place is a Pittsburgh staple, it's been operating since the 30's, and is probably the most iconic Pittsburgh restaurant. Their deli 'sammiches' hit the spot, piled high on thick cut Italian bread with cole slaw and fresh cut French fries. 

Don't like deli sandwiches? That's fine, they also have wings, pizza, fish, spaghetti, chili, nachos, and salads just to name a few. I honestly can't vouch for any of those besides the chili because 9 times out of 10 I can't resist ordering the traditional sammich! But I've heard from many people they're all good! 

Another interesting thing, they don't take down orders; They've got this stuff down to a science! Even when they're getting slammed.

I've been there for four dinners and one lunch since they opened. And I have to agree with many of the other reviews that they have some service issues but they have only opened for two weeks and I'm sure they didn't expect such immediate success from day one. But more importantly the service continues to improve and I'm sure before the winter holidays, they will be resolved but regardless I'll still go because ...

1. My favorite - grilled cheese and Tuscan bean soup for $13 - OMG (only available for lunch)

2. Spicy Mac & Cheese - this is the best Mac and cheese I've had especially since I love everything spicy -- this is only on the dinner menu - I prefer the side of it rather than with Mary's roasted chicken because the side order has a crispy browning that I like but it is really a preference.

3. Here is a list of dishes I've tried and like - curry ( although really good not something I'd order for $20 often); filet minion - very good - the waiter said it was 8 oz but it looked much smaller than that even though it shrinks after cooking, or maybe my eyes were really much larger and I could have had two of those because they were awesome; scallops were perfectly cooked; Mary's roasted chicken is my son's favorite the one from the adult menu not the children's menu; salmon is good because it's simple - but you have to like good fish for the fish sake and not all the sauces- although the quinoa that comes with it is excellent.

4. I really enjoyed the My Wife's Favorite Salade with the egg - it has duck confit and it really hits the spot - although it wasn't available for lunch. I've also had the Caesars and the power salad (I can't remember if that's the name - it's quinoa and avocado). My friend thinks the Caesars is really good but I wasn't a fan because I like the stinky anchovies versus the mild ones they serve - just a difference in preference. The quinoa salad is really creamy - it was good but was way too healthy for me.

5. Pizzas are good. It's got a chewy texture but not crunchy - if it could just have that crunch it would have been awesome- don't get me wrong they're great flat breads.

6. I liked the iberico ham - my friend liked the shrimp cocktail but I just always think there isn't anything special with shrimp cocktail - that's just me - I guess the same could be said with the ham - but it was tasty. I keep meaning to order the New England fry but no one else at my table wants them - next time I'm picky dinner partners based on if they'll have fried food.  ; )

7. Cocktails - oh yes... I've tried three different ones but my fave is the champagne with blood orange - it comes with a rind of lemon and a brown sugar cube - it's the bomb... Or is that da bomb... If I could drink more- I might have blown my dinner money just on that.

8. Now for dessert - go for the apple pie. Just great. Had the salted caramel brownies but it didn't quite do it for me although everyone else at the table thought they were amazing. It was too caked for me- I'm the kind that like a bit of uncooked brownie with a flaky top and I like my caramel a bit more sticky. The pumpkin cheesecake was a disappointment - not really pumpkin tasting or whatever it is the table thought it wasn't the best. The layered cake has an amazing chocolate part of the cake - reminded me of the brownie but with a decadent ganache filling but it also came with banana cake and I'm not a fan of banana cake -- the descriptions I thought said caramelized bananas but I got it wrong -- it's a layer of banana cake and caramel. The oatmeal cranberry (I think) is good but the chocolate chip was okay. Of all the things they're good at the only gripe I have is that they're desserts could be better.

They have a huge menu, big portions, great prices, friendly service, and tasty food, which is pretty much all the points a restaurant needs to get for a great review in my book.

This was the first time I have been to this Cracker Barrel, and all my other experience with Cracker Barrel's has been in Arizona. It was pretty much exactly like the one I have been to before, with rocking chairs on the patio area (no outdoor dining, just to wait) and a shop full of country style knick-knacks in front of the dining area. They also sell some off brand soda's and candy.

The menu here is one of the biggest I have ever seen at any restaurant, to the point that they even have a huge list of side dishes (well over 20). We had Lisa for our server, and I swear she gave the best menu rundown I have ever heard. She knew everything and could answer any question, and was just one of the friendliest servers we have ever had.

Entrees range from $8 to $12, and they are all southern style. They are known for their chicken and dumplings, chicken fried steak and ham, among other things. I love that they have a dinner sampler, which comes with ham, meatloaf and chicken & dumplings. As a person that loves trying different things, this is a meal for me! The chicken and dumplings is probably the best of the items I named above, as it is juicy and soaked in a delicious gravy. The ham and meatloaf were also very good, though nothing that special.

Most of the dishes come with your choice of two or three sides, which as mentioned above they have a large variety to choose from. Heck, they even have sides you can only get on certain days of the week. I got the fried okra, hash brown casserole, and turnip greens. All the sides taste great and I want to go back and try them all.

In addition, the meals come with corn bread muffins and biscuits. The corn bread is on the savory side, and I prefer sweet corn bread, but if you like it saltier you will probably enjoy it. I love the biscuits and I suggest you get a side of apple butter to go with them.

I've been to Cracker Barrel's before for breakfast, and they do a great job on that to. Just like the huge portions at dinner, their breakfast are big to. They have a breakfast sampler with ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits, grits, hash browns and gravy for around $10. You just cant beat that variety and size for the price. They also have great pancakes and French toast if you have a morning sweet tooth.

My only real criticism here is that some of the food is a little on the bland side for my pallet, but then again I'm one of those people that loves heavily spiced food, so that is largely a personal preference issue. I have also been told that this Cracker Barrel often has large wait times, though we got right in the night we came, and we were a party of five.

The biggest compliment I can give to the Cracker Barrel is that everything here taste home made. It reminds me of my grandmother's cooking, who is from Arkansas and knows here southern food. Actually my grandmother was with us when we came here and she loved everything about it.

If you want a large southern style meal that taste like it came out of someone's home kitchen, then bring your appetite and stop by here. I'm not usually big on chain restaurants, but Cracker Barrel just get's everything right. I look forward to coming here for some comfort food again.",2017-08-15 08:49:12

The patio is quite large and do take advantage of the early bird breakfast/brunch specials (before 11AM daily) and it's damned cheap breakfast.

I'm a meat lover with the exception of pork, and know what good meat taste like. 
I was really looking forward to trying the lamb and was a bit disappointed it wasn't the burst of flavor(I was expecting) it was rubbery and tasteless. 
Did they have to put bacon on the chicken?!!! So sad...I was like ""NO!"" 

 I really hope they start marinating the meats more and perhaps let it rest for a longer period of time for the meat to observe the flavors of the seasoning.

I like the fact that they do offer photography services....just incase you have great company but remember for 2 pics I paid $30. So take it easy (don't turn it into a photo shoot!) lol

I have tried 8 different flavours here and found the milk tea to be my favourites. I found their sweet dew oolong a tad bitter and the lomonway was a tad too sour.

Our problem was a lack of understanding about the menu offerings.  Lots of dosas and curries and what we ordered was excellent, but we could not understand the ethnic servers.  Even when the owner came over, we never really understood the dishes.

They do offer a buffet lunch, but we have not been there for it and don't know if signage is there to explain what is being offered.

Too bad, as it was packed with Indians with my wife and I the only gringos there.  You just know it is good.

For starters, we opted for the hummus with fresh pita bread, a side of mixed pickles and the falafel salad. Hummus was super smooth and flavourful, yum! I love pickled pretty much anything so totally enjoyed the pickles plate, which was comprised of olives, pink turnip, and hot peppers. The falafels were awesome - not dry in the middle at all and super crispy on the outside, perfection! Also loved the bright, fresh tasting dressing on the salad.

We both ordered seafood entrees for our mains. My mom got the grilled shrimp and I selected the baked red snapper. Both dinners were cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned. Their rice was so so good - if I wasn't so stuffed I would have kept eating.

To end the meal, we shared a pot of Moroccan mint tea and the dessert (sorry I forget the name) comprised of warm custard, angel hair flio pastry, honey, and crushed pistachios - it was just heavenly!

First time was to get an international health certificate for my dog to come with us to Paris.  Out of the 4-5 vets I called for a quote, this one was fair price and allowed me to handle the process to get the USDA stamp.  I only felt safer this way to get it back within 10 days of my trip.  The other 3 vets weren't even certify with the USDA....they shouldn't be doing this for clients.  I would be very upset paying the health certificate fee and than having to fly out to LA to get the USDA stamp and they told me the vet wasn't certified with the USDA.  I doubled check with the USDA that Dr. Brooks is on their list.   I'm very happy they're honest here on this part.  It saved me the nightmare.  =) 

I came back here the second time to update my dog's shots, because he started to enjoy walking outside after 4-5 years.  I made an appointment with Dr. Brooks, I had to wait about 2 weeks, I think maybe a little sooner.  It was a little confusing process, because I specifically made an appointment for shots with Dr. Brooks not a vet tech since my dog is small and wanted to make sure he won't get sick.  When I got in, the receptionist told me there is a long wait for the vet visit.  I told her, well how long is it, because my appointment was with Dr. Brooks not vet tech...what's the point of making an appointment if I'm going to have to wait an hour?  I was like whatever, have a vet tech give him the shots, I just don't want him sick afterwards.  I was annoyed too because I could have went to South Buffalo Animal Hospital, the shots were cheaper there and there was no wait.  It basically worked itself out.  I was taken into the room within 10 minutes and did have Dr. Brooks.  She's very caring and sweet.  I'm very happy it worked itself out, because I didn't want to change vet.

We show up and almost miss it because it is not a big joint. Around 8 tables inside and it reminded me kinda of a froyo place from the coloring of the walls to the décor. The servers were very friendly and amiable and were very attentive to our requests. We asked if they had any adult beverages to which they sadly said no but they told us that the residence inn next door would sell bottles of vino and that we could bring in to consume the deliciousness.

They ask everyone if they want the Miso soup which is fine I suppose so I ordered one but unfortunately I was not a huge fan. It was overly salty and tasted like an ""instant"" miso soup pack so sad face. Sorry to have to disagree with the yelpers :-/ maybe my palette from having too much soup all over Asia especially in Japan?? We ordered the mixed Nigiri, Fresh fish nigiri, and the Dynamite roll. The nigiri was just okay in my opinion. Definitely not terrible but nothing really special by it and maybe that's a little food snobbery so apologies but I have had a ton of good sushi all over the country, Canada, all over Asia. The Dynamite roll was the better than the nigiri which to me is not a good sign. I am one of those folks that go to sushi to have the legit nigiri or sashimi over rolls that have a ton of sauce poured over it. In defense of this Dynamite roll however, it was well flavored without over saucing and a good portion of fish included so nice job making a solid roll.

I like the option of sitting in the bar which is loud and smoky or in the dining room which is much more quiet and non smoking.

There are plenty of TVs to keep you entertained. The menu has a variety of comfort foods such as soups, salads, hamburgers, sandwiches, sides, alcohol, and desserts.

The wedding is next month so it's very short notice, which I realize. When I arrived, I was shown where the bridesmaid dress section was. I was surprised on how small the selection was. Luckily in the end, I found 2 dresses that I did really like. After selecting the dresses that I wanted to try on, I went to the fitting room where they had misplaced my dresses already. They didn't go too far away but still, if you're reserving a room for me why would the dresses be moved? 

The prices seemed okay. They ranged from $100-$139. The person that I had an appointment with wasn't very helpful. She didn't offer to get any other sizes for me or anything. I've had much better service at BCBGs at the outlet malls (I think they have the best customer service when it comes to clothing). Turned out some of the styles I selected to try on didn't even come in the color I needed. Ummm that would have been nice to know before I tried on 10 dresses.

After deciding on the two styles I wanted I inquired about ordering them and if they'd be here in time. Turned out it wouldn't work out. I guess you need more than a month to have a dress shipped to the store. Really? 

When I went home I looked online and noticed that they had dresses that were online exclusive. The shipping times weren't bad either 8-11 business days. They are currently running a promotion for free shipping too. Why didn't the sales associates mention this? I told them that we weren't set on any styles and were pretty flexible. Funny too because one of the dresses I really liked can be ordered online too in my size and the correct color. When I asked her if it came in another shade of purple I needed she said probably not. Why wouldn't you look? And guess what, it is offered.

So it looks like I will be getting the dress I need as well as the rest of the bridal party. However, it was without the help of the staff and all through research of my own. I would not recommend using David's Bridal for bridesmaid dresses and will choose to go somewhere else in the future after this experience.",2012-08-27 16:53:17

Anyway, I met my dad here for lunch yesterday at around 11:30 and the place had some customers, but wasn't crazy busy. We sat outside, and that was very nice. We decided to split the caesar salad with chicken and the chicken sandwich with the goat cheese and fig jam. The caesar was really good, the dressing tasted excellent and was tossed perfectly, and the chicken was also very flavorful, but the whole thing still had a light quality to it. It was tasty. The sandwich was also very good. I could taste each ingredient, which I like, the bread was good, crispy but soft at the same time, and the combo of flavors was really great. Also, the service was excellent, my water was never empty.

They also had various sandwiches which they also liked. I had 2 different salads on 2 consecutive days. The veggies were fresh and crisp and the portions were large, but the first day, they messed up my order (wrong salad dressing, and on the salad, not on the side as requested). The second day, the salad was perfect.

If you're into desserts, their display features the BIGGEST and prettiest cakes I've seen in a long time! We didn't have any, preferring to save our appetites for dinner, but man, if you're going to splurge on calories, this'd be the place!

The servers especially knew every little detail about the items on the menu and made recommendations, even offering substitutions on things for the two women at the table who were pregnant and wanted sushi that was okay for them to eat.

The food itself was delicious.  Everything was made with quality ingredients, you could taste how fresh it was.  I loved the Dynamite Scallop Roll and the Crispy Prawn Roll, I had the Soft Shell Crab Roll as well and it was good but the other two just blew it out of the water.

The place had a classic dark feel, but the   energy was much livelier and younger. It was a perfect fit for the Cosmopolitan hotel (modern, romantic, and young). I would go back to this steak house. 

The order was:
* Complimentary dinner rolls (5 of 5). I loved their free dinner rolls. Five dough balls were baked together in a small dutch-oven looking little pot. It was fresh and tasted like Hawaiian bread. It was paired with a green butter sauce. I think the sauce was made from green onion or chives. It had a strong green taste, but it was delicious with the fresh dinner rolls. It was a great start to the steak dinner.
* Tuna tartare (3 of 5) $19 on corn tuille - pecans - avocado. Very fresh tuna tartare on top of a chip. The chip was big enough to hold the tuna tartare, but we had to break it apart to eat it. I am not a fan using a chip to hold tuna tartare. I think it is messy and makes the dish hard to share.
* Foie gras french toast (3.5 of 5) $24 green apple - almond brioche - sherry gastrique. Tasty, but a little heavy on the syrup. I would also have enjoyed it more, if they considered slicing the apples thinner.  The apples were presented as two chunks and I thought it would have been prettier and easier to eat with the foie gras if it was sliced thinner. I typically think that foie gras appetizers are like pieces of artwork. If you mix and match what is given to you, it enhances the foie gras taste. 
* Hamachi (3 of 5) $16 jalapenos - pear vinaigrette. Fresh, and taste was not memorable. I expected more from the four slices of hamachi.
* filet 10 oz. (4 of 5) $48 - Tasty and juicy. Nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare. No complaints, but at the end, the rib steak was tastier because of the fat content.
* bone-in rib steak 20 oz. (4 of 5) $49 - Tasty and the bone was so small, it was almost like boneless. This was tasty and juicy.   
* add on topping foie gras (5 of 5) $15 - What a bang for the buck! This is probably the cheapest add on foie gras price ever and it was a huge piece. Delicious!!!
* add on side raw horseradish $2 - We were slightly disappointed that the menu asked for $2 for raw horseradish. Nonetheless, we had to order it.

Other breakfast wraps or burritos I've had in the past consisted mostly of scrambled eggs and not much of anything else. So this had a good ratio of everything.

My coworker Brittenee and I come in around 6:45 PM today (12/10/2016) on our lunch break. We saw that the previous people who got bowls had like a mountain of food so I got even more excited to see huge portions! When it was our turn, we both got bowls. They have brown rice and white rice, we both ordered white rice. There wasn't even enough to cover the bottom layer while the people before got a lot of rice. If they ran out, we would've been okay with waiting but they didn't bother asking. Fine whatever. She got chicken and I got steak. The portion of steak was pretty good for the amount of rice we got! 

Moving down the line, my coworker got extra sour cream and cheese on her bowl. The girl doing it was making faces and mocking her. After that I can hear her whispering rude things about us to the cashier at the end while the cashier was laughing. That's so disrespectful. I'm sorry you make less than $10 an hour and you're miserable at your work, but feel free to quit so someone who would appreciate it could take over. I'm sure my little 15 year old sister would do a much better job than she did. I had no problem calling the manager Jesus after. He was extremely kind and apologetic. Hopefully he rethinks his staff and hires people who deserve the money and experience. 

Now for the food, it was really good! The portion was smaller than everyone elses we saw and smaller than all the pictures, but it's still filling! The flavors are great and I really recommend it. The corn salsa is a little spicy but it added the perfect amount of heat to it and also added a great crunch element to it. To get avocado on it, it is an additional $1.25 so keep that in mind! The location was clean. They have beer and a soda fountain. Who doesn't like a good beer with food? The food for two bowls (without drinks, chips, or anything else) was about $17.00. 

I'd definitely get the bowl again, just not from this location. Great food, poor service.",2016-12-11 04:21:40

We started with a couple cocktails - the jalapeño margarita and the cucumber cooler. I wasn't a big fan of the cooler but the margarita was well made. 

For the main course, we got the sirloin Oscar and the Prime Rib. The prime rib came with a choice of garden salad, Caesar or spinach salad. I got the spinach salad which was crisp and was made well with strawberries and pecans. We got the garlic mashed potatoes and the twice baked potato as sides. The twice baked potato was an absolute winner! Apparently the potato is baked, scooped and mixed with bacon, chives and sour cream and baked again..yumm!!

Instead we settled on the following items:

Sliders, $10.99
Potato Skins, $9.99
Baby Back Ribs, $23.99

The Potato Skins were very good and so were the Sliders.  However, the Baby Back Ribs were terrible.  They were too dry and didn't ""slide"" off the bone like you'd expect them to.  Next time, we'll pass on those.

Our server was very friendly and entertaining.  She also never rushed us.  Since we were meeting friends on this visit, we had a long dinner and stayed for drinks and Dessert much later than most diners.  She was super cool about it and stopped by to check in on us from time to time.

Too bad about our deleted favorite menu items.

I eyed this again but with a 45 minute trek home in the scorching weather, I was afraid it would melt even in my air conditioned car. 

In the end I went with a cherry tart as the cherry pie is supposedly a best seller and the tart was the right size for a little after-dinner treat. The cherry flavour is just right - not too tart and not too sweet- and the crust is nice and flaky. $2.90 for the tart. Wanda's also sells gluten free and vegan pastries. If you're looking for a great place for pies, cookies and pastries in Kensington market, you have to try Wanda's Pie in the Sky!

Back when we first visited this buffet, they had just opened with ""teaser"" prices of around $25 for the seafood dinner. Now, a couple years later, they know they've got a hit on their hands with the long lines so they've jacked it up to $34. 

I like this buffet for one reason, and one reason alone -- the hot crab legs. It's rare to find plump, juicy, decent sized crab legs at buffets in and around Vegas. In other places, they are usually thinly sliced in half, incredibly salty, and still half frozen. If there's anything that makes my blood boil, it's frozen crab legs.

Obviously everyone likes to pick the biggest clusters, but pay attention to the color and texture of the shell. You want to pick bright orange colored crab legs, and you want the shell to be hardened. It's more fresh. The pale looking and softer shelled crab legs have been sitting in the salt water longer, resulting in salty, mushy meat. Who wants salty and mushy crab meat? Not me.

As far as the rest of the food, the dessert, and even the unlimited alcoholic beverages? Ehh. It's all just okay in my book, nothing that good to rave about. Much of the fish is generally dry and overcooked. The prime rib is decent. But If you're paying for the seafood dinner, it's only worth it if you eat a lot of crab legs. Hot. Crab.

Like someone mentioned, I was not a fan of the names of the menu items. They were too hard to remember and did not describe the dish well enough. 

There seems to be an abundance of dishes with mushroom in them which is great if you want mushrooms with everything. However, if you have a 10 person table, it could be frustrating when you see 5 or 6 out of the 8 dishes you ordered have mushrooms which take up half the dish. Overall I did not like the food variety, but I understand that vegetarian restaurants have to be more limited in variety.

Food quality varies by dish but for the most part it's above average quality.

The service you get is what you pay for. All of my friends thought the prices were reasonable. Waiters are attentive and polite.

The dessert is subject to availability but they have two options for traditional Chinese dessert (both hot). I would highly recommend anyone who is a sweet tooth to give them a try as they were the highlight of my meal. They were also easily the cheapest item you can order (besides plain rice) and were well worth the money.

3.5 stars. I have a hard time wanting to go back for dinner because as mentioned above, I really don't like a lot of the menu. Of course it all comes down to the individual's taste buds.",2013-12-13 20:22:14

I could have another, 
but probably not from here. 

I've never had a Fat Tuesday before, and have only seen people carrying around the iconic, large and skinny yards. So I was looking forward to sipping on one myself as I walked the strip. My boyfriend and I walked around Planet Hollywood until we found it near Guess. I'll admit, I was so excited that I did not even see that there was a line and started asking the bartender about their drinks. She didn't reply a single word, and simply pointed behind us. The bouncer comes up to us and tells us we have to get in line. Of course, we feel silly and ashamed that we didn't realize there was a line, but they didn't let us know nicely either. 
When we reach the bouncer again during our turn in queue, he checks my ID and says in a degrading tone, ""you'll wait right here"" for the next bartender to be available. When I get to the bartender she failed to ever say Hi or smile. She just told me the price with a side of attitude.

No thanks, not when there's tons of other places serving practically the same alcoholic slushies. 

By the way, if you're looking to even get buzzed, you better buy extra shots because these drinks are nothing more than frozen sugar water. However, if you like overly sweet drinks, it might be OK.",2016-07-30 06:54:43

It was a Friday night and this place was PACKED!!!  Crazy busy.   We had an 8:00 reservation for five.  We all came early thinking we would meet for a drink but it was way too busy so we went across the street to Martini.  At 7:58 we rushed over to meet our reservation, EXCEPT they weren't ready for us....  Until nearly 8:30.  Sadly we left half full drinks that we could have finished if they had chosen to use the phone number they had solicited when we made the reservation.  
Initially they sat us at a four top with three (not petite) gals jammed in on the sette.  They realized this and moved us to a six top, much better situation.  They also immediately poured us sparkling wine to thank us for our wait.   We received two or three glasses a piece which was needed because our server was not ready to have a table sat.  We waited about 15 minutes to order wine and he was not ready to take our appetizer orders at this point.  We finally ordered our meals at 9:15.  
Now the food - 
Appetizers - 
yellow tail - amazing!!!!
Iberico ham - the combination of flavors on this plate are surprising and fulfilling
new england fry - although fabulous pales in comparison to the others above.
Entrees -
Scallops (three of us had these) perfectly seared, cauliflower puree so yummy with the buttery flavor of the scallops.
Scottish Salmon - a bit on the salty side but flavorful, fresh and just plain yummy
BURRATA, ROSSO BRUNO & TEARDROP TOMATOES - delicious and fresh
Sides -
Brussel Sprouts - My personal favorite.  A bit heavy on the bacon, in fact more bacon than brussel sprouns which saddened me because they were so good.
mac and Cheese - Plain and simply delicious
Roasted cauliflower - Fresh, great combo of flavors
Spinach - good but for me a bit on the salty side
Dessert

I was here years ago when Paris LV opened and it was fresh and new. Being originally from Montreal, my French is more than passable, and then it was fun and cool to come into the Paris lobby and speak French to anyone working here. Now, they have no idea what I'm saying as none of the staff I tried to converse with spoke or understood the language. The décor is still adorable and tres Parisienne, with nods to the Art Nouveau metro signs, faux outdoor cabarets, and the adorable patisseries and boutiques along les faux rues Francais. I was disappointed in the drinks my mother and I had at a ""café"" in the lobby; they were overpriced and small (even for Vegas standards). The gal serving us was nice but clad in super-short Daisy Duke shorts that barely covered her nether regions and was about as French as Honey Boo Boo. I was a little surprised - not in a good way - to see pseudo-strippers in thongs and bra-like tops gyrating to music atop an elongated table in the center of the lobby (I know this is Vegas, but STILL!). I swear, I'm no prude, but the atmosphere just seemed....seedier here than in the other major hotel casinos we visited. 

I must make note of the bathrooms, too. The women's facilities were dingy, and some of the enameled ceramic pedestal sinks were cracked. Some of the bathroom stalls were dirty, and some doors had  graffiti carvings on them (at least, mine did). They didn't appear to be maintained well. 

The replicas of the Eiffel Tower and l'Arc du Triomphe were awesome landmarks, and we took a few photos by them. And the few folks we talked to who worked here were friendly. All in all, this is a cutesy place to check out, take some photos in, and then leave.",2014-01-09 06:55:17

For that price I can't argue much with the beef, which I have to say wasn't the best and felt like something you find in the frozen department.

Excuse me birds, I'm trying to eat.

Soothing, it is not.

The margaritas are glorified lemonade; I had to have 17 of them before I even started to feel a tiny bit buzzed, and even then it may have been just from wishing so hard.

Texturewise, if you told me I was eating mountain goat I would not have argued with you.  Note to management: sharp knives would be nice to cut through the stringy cut of meat.

A nod to our server, as service was excellent and the ""that spicy mango thingy"" drink (a Serrano pepper & mango infused tequila margarita) is unique and will please those of you who like cocktails with a bite. 

But, that's about as good as it got. ""Farm-to-table"" inspires visions of entrees with crisp, fresh, complex and discernible flavors. Our food reminded me of standard hotel fare. 

We started with the crab cake and while the crab was very good there was way too much filler. To the extent that I would get whole bites of filler, disappointing my palate with a mealy bready effect. 

Next, one of each of the street tacos. Both were terribly -- like disgustingly -- greasy. Beware: hold these puppies right over your plate because as you angle them for a bite, a river of taco-seasoning -infused oil will stream out the back. And, the chili-powder flavor didn't do it for me. 

Finally, the Arctic Char entree: the vegetables and the fish were each overcooked. Though, there was some potential as the cut of fish seemed quality and the veggie selection showed good choices. Besides being overcooked, there was no flavor. None. Nada. :(

After being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped Popcorn.  It was unnecessary but good.  

Next came juicy Fried Pickles with a really good Caper Mayo Dressing.  A hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  Meanwhile, I had a hard time deciding whether I preferred the delicious Chocolate Milk Shake with Chocolate Syrup or the thick and sweet Whipped Cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  I even lamented to Diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  And, so it did!    

Then the burgers and fries arrived.  For me, a Classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  There was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and I had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty Shoestring Fries that accompanied it.

Meanwhile, Diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare Nom Nom Burger with Kobe Beef and Cheddar Cheese, as well as fulfilling Fat Fries.  Our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room.

It seemed this was going to be a good experience at this point things were looking very promising. That soon changed. 

As we made our way to the line, we passed in front of the deserts, not much on display but a few pastries, some coffee cakes, and some cookies. Next came salads, there were five choices, with the Asian beef salad being really good, very spicy, I found thick cuts of jalapenos. I liked it. 

I discovered three egg dishes, and a made to order omelet station. The egg and ham dish was runny, just didn't seem seasoned. The breakfast meats including bacon, link sausage and ham. I love bacon, but this wasn't crispy enough for me. There were the usual waffle and cheese blitz dishes. And then there were several meats sliced to order, like turkey, roast beef, and ham, but none of the sides you'd expect to go with them, like yams, green beans etc.... 

I did find bagels with a ton of fresh made cream cheese spreads, everything from salmon to sun dried tomatoes, a limited amount of fresh fruits, like cantaloupe and honeydew melon. But no fresh berries.

I also got it loaded up with jalapeños, cheese and onions--great choice. It was beyond tasty. It was the perfect, warm brick in my tummy that I needed to fuel me. Tender hunks of beef, perfect spice and a little heat, it was bomb-diggity. My man ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich, which came piled high with their awesome slaw. Let's just say it didn't last long on his plate. Although I'm not going to lie--I was pretty sad he didn't offer me a bite. 

Although I obviously ordered meaty foods to scarf, I really appreciated that there was something there for pretty much everyone! Vegan, vegetarian--there's noms there for you! 

Our check was dirt-cheap and the vibe in this place is just awesome. It's relaxed, but fun and the art is a great touch. I suggest grabbing a 6-pack with some friends, pulling up a stool at the chili bar and having a delicious meal at Palookaville.",2012-04-09 02:16:19

Everyone needs to eat and cooking should be a joy in life. Growing up with a chef for a father and a mother than could rival him any day, the love of food has always been an intricate part of my life.

I would rather go to Chinatown for my produce because it can get rather pricey here. What Sunflower Market lacks in, they make up for in specialty health food items. I am not a fan of paying an arm and a leg for getting essential necessities. I dislike places like Whole Foods that monopolize on people's desire to live a better lifestyle. Instead of paying the eight dollars for bulgar wheat, I will come here, and buy it for five. 

Next to Trader Joe's, this place is the best place to pick up vegan friendly foods that you would pay dearly for at other places. Grab a few of the snacks that they have up front. Their veggie chips are delicious. My friend loves the green beans, but everything in that plastic container is spectacular. The dried fruits are also a good buy.

The wife and I tried it on a regular Tuesday evening (non speciality night) and it was probably the tastiest food I have ever eaten at a buffet in Vegas.

Not as huge of a selection as places like Carnival World at Rio, but the food at M's buffet is tasty while retaining some subtlety. Much of it could be regular restaurant food rather than buffet fare.

Desserts were terrific - someone else reports that ""most of it is flans"" - actually some of the things that look like flans are Creme Caramels, so it can appear this way.  I love the way the desserts were tiny so you could portion it out how you like without taking a huge slab of something just for a bite or two.

Add all this to the friendliest, most polite staff I have ever met in this city and the whole package is a total winner.

My only warning - as we were leaving at around 5:30 (we ate early) the queue had become miserably enormous - plan to dine early or expect a long wait. There's a lot of coupon books out and about and it's the first few weeks so I'd expect things to settle down eventually.

Edit 1: Happily M have instigated a sort of ""fast pass"" system where you can get a ticket for half-hourly batches allowed into the buffet and return at that time. This way you can go off gambling and come back to only a short wait at your designated time. A good way of dealing with the monster lines this excellent buffet is attracting as the word gets around.

Edit 2: A few people have commented about the lack of labeling of the different dishes. Most dishes are now labeled. Pretty much everything but the biggest no-brainers are identified. I like how M is actively correcting minor issues such as this to keep things perfect.

Update: It had to happen - M has raised the price of this buffet by four bucks for lunch and dinner - not sure about breakfast. It's still a great deal especially for lunch. I'd prefer they put up the price a bit than reduce the quality.",2009-04-01 03:20:11

Tried out the Original Blue Ribbon Sandwich shortly after this location opened and was left feeling underwhelmed. Until Chick-fil-a opens I figured it was one of the few options for a chicken sandwich..however after my second visit, I don't think I'll be back. Although I give the place credit for offering monthly sandwich specials, I was extremely disappointed by their December sandwich (the Holiday Helper). Despite being filled to the brim with With house smoked mac & cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce...the Sandwich was bland. 
Given the high cost for a meal (+$2 for fries and slaw but no soda) and the lack of flavor...I'd recommend you walk across the street to Shake Shack as their chicken sandwich is more worth your money & calories. 

Dining area: I dined in on both locations and noticed that the dining area was consistently dirty. I Often saw new customers bus their own tables or eat next to other customer's trash. White bench tables could also use some cleaning as they were filthy and sticky.

Take La Carnita's vibe and place it on King Street. It's a new hot spot but without the pretentious-ness and is a perfect pit stop on a bar/snack crawl in the King West nabe (i.e. across the street is Valdez, then you could go over to Gusto's rooftop and Spirit House all within the block). 

The music is the same as at La Carnita but  isn't as loud; the drinks are just as boozy if not boozier than Carnita. I'm a fan of the open window at the front where you can look out into King Street.

Taylor Corrigan, formerly on the bar at Origin, is now bar manager at HOTB and he's doing an incredible job. He personally made me The Journalist (gin, cointreau, lemon, etc) for me (I'm a lucky gal, what can I say?). But what's really cool about their cocktail menu is that they have cocktails made by guest bartenders from some of the best bars in the US (Drumbar, Employees Only, etc). They also have rootbeer floats! 
I also like that the cocktail menu isn't five pages long. It's a short selection so it's easy to pick and choose. 

Of course, we had the signature fried bologna sandwich. It's warm and hot and the mozzarella is house made. This is not the sandwich I was throwing out from my brown paper bag in elementary school, that's for sure. 

The Kentucky Fried Chicken Handshake sandwich looks as creepy as it seems and apparently, many people hide the hand under a napkin on a plate (we did it!). But the sandwich is mo-fo hearty. You will not leave hungry that's for sure. On King St., it's a good price point too. 

I have heard good things about: the johnnycake, the lobster roll (you can purchase one to three rolls for different price points) and  the bones in a bucket.

First things first: a big thank you to Pitt Yelper Kat M. for suggesting husband and I come here on our trip to the 'Burgh.  You were right, we loved Church Brew Works!

If you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.]

For two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.  

Our brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.  Aaaaa-men.",2011-06-05 12:28:30

My problem is they used to give you 3 chicken strips and fries in the 'lunch box' but recently changed it to 3 chicken wings and fries with a drink. If you know anything about a chicken you know that wings have almost no meat on them and are extremely difficult to handle when immediately out of the fryer. The strips were easy to eat and could be cut up if needed. They used to let you upgrade to gravy fries, Nacho fries or loaded fries for no extra charge. Now they have three options: gravy and works for a $3 up charge and plain included. I have no problem paying for the upgraded fries but they are not very flavorful compared to the previous fries. 

Their service is always nice and pleasant but seems to have changed and the atmosphere is different. I'll probably go back but not for the lunchbox because it was for sure not worth the price this time. I left feeing hungry still which was not great.",2016-01-21 21:57:43

Sure there have been other restaurants that have stirred such emotions but for whatever reason - generally distance or a desire to try something new - I have not yet had the opportunity.  With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.

Described simply as ""an organic coffee and breakfast bar, café, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery"" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Café (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.

Ethiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.

Croque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'

Famous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and crème fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's ""French Pancakes"" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'

Blueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.

Pumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.

So walking in, I was a little put off. Stuffy. Empty. Sign on the tea machine saying out of order. No smiles or friendly hellos. No explanations of the menu as we clearly were checking it out. Personally, I like bubbly cashiers who go out of their way to ask if we are first timers or need a suggestion. 

After debating, we ordered two gyros. One chicken and one lamb. One with a side of hummus and one with a side of garlic fries. We shared everything so that I could write my review with my of a variety. The chicken gyro was better than the lamb. The lab seemed tough and chicken was very tender. Good sized portions for the lunch special. The hummus was good but nothing I would rave about. The garlic fries though, wow were those tasty! Whew.

Thankfully the new stadium abandoned the idea of communal urination. That is about the only upgrade I see.

Not as well done as my husband had hoped but he should have asked, or for the price of the burgers they should ask! We also ordered wings, they were awful! The menu said crispy wings with BBQ or Spicy Buffalo, it was neither it was a very spicy chili sauce and soggy chicken wings. We did not end up eating them.

It's nice because if you eat there they will bring your food to you, but since it was my first time ordering the salad I didn't know they were supposed to give you the dressing on the side.

There were 9 parties in front of us but luckily they are mostly party of 3 or more.  This is a really small space so half of their tables can only accommodate party of 2's! In fact, their entire patio only sit 2's so lucky us, we only waited for 20mins. 

I've read a few reviews on Yelp complaining about the long food wait or bad service and I totally disagree. All the staffs were very attentive and friendly. Our lattes came within 5 mins and food came within 15 mins.  I had the sunny foole and for a person that doesn't like beans, I almost finished my plate!  The foole was very flavourful and fun to scoop with the bread. The honey cardamon latte was as good as people had described, slight hint of cardamon with just the right amount of sweetness. It's different and you probably won't find it else where so I strongly recommend you try it.

Simply put, I love this place.  I love everything about it.  Where else can you roll in with 3 bucks and roll out full?

Nothing beats a Captain Bills Italian sub.  Nothing.

I continued to go there over the years, I got married, I had kids and I took them there.

You choose what goes in your Pho

Cons:
Sides are pretty pricey here

There are tons of Vietnamese Pho restaurants with the name Kim Po. I don't know if they're all linked together or they just use the same name.  This one is your standard Pho restaurant.   Not amazing, but not bad either.

The one thing I like about this place is you choose exactly what you want in your Pho.  Most Pho places have predetermined bowls of Pho with what goes in it.  This place let's you pick which meats you want in it. I'm a fan of brisket but not always of what most places put with brisket in Pho places so that was a nice thing for me.   

The Pho here is OK.  The broth was decent, it felt like it was missing something though.  Portions are pretty good for the price.  I usually like to order the deep fried spring rolls to go with my meal but they were like $7-8 here, yikes.  Another dollar or 2 and I have myself another bowl of Pho!!

Honestly, I came here because our original choice of Deer Garden was packed and the wait time would of been crazy.  It would take something like that again for me to come back as well.

It actually didn't even look like a dance floor more like a walk way. The place was packed with people. The music was not bad at all. I think if there's more dancing room it would have been more fun. Looks like all the tables were all booked. There were few hidden rooms filled with people.

I would say this place would have gotten a better rating if it wasn't for the space. It was too packed and not really as fun if you can't dance away your drunkness.

It was around 9am so I was anticipating that.  I was keeping my fingers crossed for a short wait time.  Luckily it was only 5 minutes and I actually think we waited less than that. The place itself has many many tables inside and also an outdoor patio seating for those nice Vegas days.  

One of the ladies came over right away to get our drink order.  Turns out she wasn't our waitress so it was nice that they all chip in a help each other out.  I'm sure they know people love their morning coffee as soon as they can get it!   Since i ordered coffee, she left a full carafe with us.  This is great since i drink coffee quickly.  Shortly after our actual waitress came to take our order.  I decided on the Country Benny and the hubs went with the breakfast burrito.  

Food is here already??!   It came out quickly, which makes me happy (and my stomach!).   The country benny was great! Biscuit layered with sausage, eggs and topped with country gravy.  Can you feel the calories? It was a great combination of breakfast items topped with a very flavorful gravy.  My only issue was the sausage used.  Almost seemed like it was microwaved for 10 seconds.  Hmmm.  But the rest of the dish was wonderful. 

My husband's burrito was fabulous.  I had a little taste and wished I had ordered that.  It was filled with eggs, bacon, potatoes, onions and cheese.  Salsa was on the side.  The burrito was huge and was surprised he finished it all!  

Both of our meals had a side of breakfast potatoes.  When I say a side...  I mean a heaping pile of Idaho!   I think we could have split one side for the two of us.  They were fantastic.  Crispy with a great seasoning of YUM.  

What I thought was cute was their little black or yellow eggs faces on the tables.  You can change it to yellow when you need attention at your table.   It beats trying to wave down a waitress.  

Per my check in - I was Egg-cited to try it and happy we did!  We had so much for breakfast we were full until dinner.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!...   Someone at a close table ordered blueberry pancakes and they looked amazing!  Think that will be next!",2013-08-27 16:22:51

The staff was fantastic... You could barely finish your meal before they would ask if you were done with it... They do not believe in letting plates sit around and clog up a table... I like that... The refills kept coming without a lull, which was also great... 

I went for the chorizo tacos and I was not disappointed... You could probably put jalapeno bacon on anything and I'd eat it, though... lol  Seriously, scrambled eggs, cheese, cilantro and chorizo?  All wrapped in some floury goodness?  I was full midway into the second one, but I kept trying to finish... I still get a tear in my eye when I think about that last bite I left on my plate...

But the past few wing orders , the wing to drumstick ratio has not been correct and there were no apologies. I am sure there are many more rules of the menu that I am unaware of .

She went back and added a couple drops more .. but she was not happy . Myself and my party have been coming to all zipps locations for over 10 years . We know what the margaritas are suppose to look and taste like . And side note , she had the dirtiest shirt on .

The matcha cream puff we ate at a table right outside of Petit Nuage.

They were nice enough to get us a knife and plate so we could cut it up and share it. 

The macaron flavors we bought were lemon-lavender, and sake peach blossom. We had the sake peach blossom. I did not think it tasted particularly of sake, but there was a dollop of something akin to peach jam on the inside that I thought was quite nice. The lemon-lavender one I ended up giving to a certain little cousin of mine who told me that if I went, she wanted a macaron (she's never been to Petit Nuage, but saw me looking up places on Yelp and told me she wanted me to go to this one).

It's international but housed in Scottsdale and the Fashion Director is my friend Susan Di Staulo.  They had two fashion shows in the main dinning room featuring clothing from local boutiques. 

They brought samples to our table all afternoon and everything I tried was fabulous. The calamari was to die for! It was some of the best calamari I've ever had. I'll admit I like my calamari lightly battered with no added zing, and lots of lemon. This calamari had some subtle spices added, I couldn't quite figure out what the flavors were but it was delicious. Definitely not too much, AND they were lightly battered! 

The scallops were excellent and so was the spicy tuna roll.

The decor of the restaurant was sleek, modern and eco friendly. Their bathrooms were amazing and had two different flushing buttons. My friends and I assumed they were for #1 and #2... save water with #1...?

So here's the deal: the menu has three different items, in a few different sizes. Those items are burgers, fries, and shakes. The burger can be a single patty cheese burger or a double, and the fries can be medium or large. Nothing really too complicated here, folks. 

What will catch a first-time In-n-Outer off guard is how goddam delicious it all is. Greasy, yes, but they do use fresh veggie oil for fries and cut the potatoes in house. 

There is also the famous ""Secret Menu"" that isn't posted in the restaurant. I am semi-familiar with it but it is mostly comprised of specialty orders, like grilled onions for your burger, called ""Animal Style,"" or easier ways of calling out if you want extra tomatoes, or in the case of lettuce instead of the bun ""protein style."" Also, for a bigger burger (more than two patties) call it a 3 by 3 for three patties, 4 x 4 for four, etc.

The owners of the chain have been extremely careful with franchising and supposedly are keeping the owners within the family. Also, there is a widespread theory that the owners are Mormon, evidenced by Biblical citations on the bottom of drink cups and underneath fry baskets.

A little bit large a portion of grits, but my hubby always has some of my food anyways.  A girl has to stay fabulous somehow, even at my hubby's not so svelte figure expense.  I had not had grits in over 10 years.  They were very creamy, with enough cheddar and jalapeño flavor.  My hubby had the shrimp Po Boy, a very tasty sandwich.  I was too full to try their desserts, even though they looked so tempting.  I guess I have to come back for some more.",2012-05-17 00:15:19

The boyfriend got the gingerbread beer cocktail and really enjoyed it.  We might go back for the Belgian beer selection, but the service was ho-hum (sure they were busy, but I had to ask multiple times for my water to be refilled, server never came to check on the food, etc) and while the food was good, I'm not sure it's worth the price.

We got the tarte flambe-think pizza on a poppadom.  It was flavorful and crispy, and the arugula really complemented the ham nicely.  We got it with a side of potato gratin which was pretty meh.  We also had the brunch-style poutine, and here we were less impressed.  We've both eaten a lot of poutine (I'm from the Canadian border), and there's a certain way it should be--crispy thick cut fries with a rich, flavorful gravy.  The fries were rather soggy (and not just where the gravy hit them) and the gravy was pretty bland. The addition of sausage, while innovative, did not blend well with the gravy, causing the dish to be unnecessarily heavy and sweet.

Maybe we didn't pick the right menu items to fully experience Park Brugges.  I might give it another shot for lunch/dinner, but I won't be back for brunch.",2012-04-19 02:25:41

In Japan there is actually a proper protocol to order Ramen that has existed for thousands of years. Click on this link here to see the traditional Japanese way to order Ramen.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwGql-FyXjE&feature=youtu.be

Not long ago my Dad told me a story about how he went to Ichiza to eat because everyone kept telling him it was ""authentic Japanese food"". Immediately when he walked in, the crazy old man ran up to him and said something to him in Japanese. Even though my Dad is 100% Japanese, he does not speak the language since his family came to America in the 1800s. So, my Dad was like: ""what the f*ck are you trying to say to me?"". And then the  old man informed him that he could only eat for 40 minutes and then have to leave... but he did not say this to any of the ""western"" customers. I didn't believe this story when my Dad told it to me because I thought it was exaggerated. My Dad tends to talk a lot of sh!t on people and pick fights so I assumed the old man had to have asked him to leave on account of his bad behavior. Well, in the last 2 months I had a conversation with my favorite Japanese sushi chef and he told me the exact same story. The old man had singled him out for being Japanese and given him a time limit. This makes me believe that Ichiza is trying to market themselves towards ""western"" customers, and they really don't wanna see our faces there anymore. You won't get sh!t like that at SHUSEKI.  

 I have probably eaten at SHUSEKI more time then I have eaten at Fukumimi, Monta, Sora, and Anime all combined. Mainly because they are happy to  stay open when I show up after midnight. I work 12-16 hour days and usually SHUSEKI is the only Ramen-Ya still open after 11PM. We all hate how Japanese businesses usually close very early....but, SHUSEKI is actually owned and operated by an ethnically Chinese resident of Japan, so he is willing to allow his business to open later.  

When you walk into SHUSEKI, you will most likely recognize a person eating here who works for another Japanese Restaurant.  The evil old man from Ichiza frequents this place. The girls at INABA can be seen here. The legendary Hiro-San(the former fugu sushi chef who is semi-retired and working at Sushi on Rainbow now) can also be found here and he actually tells me that this is his favorite Ramen-Ya.  So, it does tend to be popular amongst the LV Japanese community even though they see it as a Chinese restaurant. 

Because this place is operated by an ethnically Chinese man who was born and raised in Japan, it's gonna have Tan Tan Men on the menu. The Tan Tan Men here at SHUSEKI is more of a Chinese style with a miso broth.  At Los Angeles Ramen-Yas they would actually have this on the menu as ""Tan Tan Style Ramen"" instead of Tan Tan Men. 

Well, I guess due to some of the negative comments by yelpers, the cook here at SHUSEKI has decided to modify the Tan Tan Men a bit.  I'm a little disappointed because some days I'm actually in the mood for a more traditional Chinese variation. 

I like the service here.  Ryan is my personal favorite worker. If he is working, he will make sure you get your ramen the way you want it. For example, Ryan can actually get the cooks to make me a bowl of Ramen that is so spicy that I just can't finish it. Last time he made me a Spicy Miso that was hotter than Orochon's. He also can get the cook to make the noodles more firm or soft depending on your preferences.  
The girls who work the late night shift are really nice, but tend to be on the super shy side. Unfortunately, only Jen and Ryan speak perfect English and it's difficult to communicate with the other workers. 

My recommendation is to get the Tan Tan Ramen with a side of Karage and Gyoza. Why? Because I command you to do so...",2012-11-18 07:39:52

After a failed attempt to dine elsewhere, we ended up at King's.  Unlike Maria Maria, King's was more than happy to promptly seat us without an unnecessary wait.

There is quite an extensive menu, and a lot of complaints on Yelp about price.  I didn't think it was all that expensive.  Most of the entrees were under $20 and that includes two sides.

I had the crab cakes with french fries and mac 'n cheese.  The crab cakes were good even if not the best I've had.  Mac 'n cheese fell a little short for me.  Not much cheese.  More like mac 'n bread crumbs.  My husband had the king crab legs.  Expensive ($43) but 1 1/2 lbs and tons of crab meat.  I tried and it was delicious.

It made me have a dream that night. I dreamt that there was chaos in the streets and as I was running for my life he stopped me. He was dressed in his pictured ""Rambo"" gear. With a cigarette in his mouth he said, ""Watch this!"" He threw a grenade in the direction of a public transportation bus and before it could explode he aimed his machine gun at.
His ammunition belt rattled and clanked as he fired with one hand, laughing hysterically as the grenade not only exploded from his gunfire-- but completely blew up the bus!

The food here really lives up to expectations. My Brussels Sprouts were crispy and crunchy and the seasoning and accompanying sauce were super addictive. This dish also really balanced out the more earthy flavor of the ground duck in the Dirty Pasta. And speaking of that pasta, yummo!! It was so perfectly fresh and al dente.  The food left a smile on my tummy and serving sizes were very generous so I had leftovers and also no space for dessert (which looked party darn good - will just have to try when I come back).

One more note - the atmosphere here is really awesome! It was great sitting at the bar, as to my left was a local bloke who works as a sommelier in Pittsburgh, and we got chatting about food and wine and bartered restaurant names in Dublin.

My major concern was that I would still be hungry afterwards, so I asked the waitress how big the mushroom flatbread is. The size estimate she gave me was decent, so I ordered only that. When it came, it was significantly smaller than she'd indicated....

Luckily, it's very dense, and I was actually super full at the end. The pesto is excellent and I really enjoyed the mushrooms. Not sure I love the texture of the crust, but the taste was there. $16 is a little pricey but at least I was full!

Regarding the rest of their menu, there are some things that intrigue me, but a lot of it (the bowls in particular) seems like stuff I make at home anyway.

Just a note: they can only split checks 4 ways. Not sure what the deal is with that. I feel like splitting checks should be a solved problem by now, but oh well.",2016-05-10 00:35:43

This cute little old-school cake donut shop.  They have donuts of every possible kind.  I know I saw an apple fritter the size of my head there too.

The donut ladies were funny, sassy, and cool.  I loved the way they bantered with each other and the guests.  They were great about putting together a 2 doz of mixed glorious donut goodness together for me.  And my 2 doz donuts were only $18 and some change.  You can't go wrong with the price!

Cash only establishment.  So search in your couch cushions, under your car seat, and pick up those pennies littered on the sidewalk.

You ride to the restaurant on a glass elevator Willy Wonka style (although this glass elevator does stop at the right floor) and are greeted by a breathtaking view (assuming there isn't any fog/too many clouds, which it was clear when I was there last night). You then work your way around the curves to your seating destination, which thankfully is marked with a number on the stairway or a trip to the bathroom could mean having a real hard time finding your party again. The menu is rather limited and pricey. I ordered a steak at the recommendation of our server...it was overcooked and just OK. My dining pals ordered chicken and fish and also had the same reaction. My culinary highlight was the bread... I have to say the view was gorgeous and you certainly will get to see everything as it moves at a reasonable pace. What would have made that experience better is a guide for what I was seeing - not being at all familiar with the Toronto skyline/area, it would have been great to have some highlights/must sees pointed out to me. When you finish eating, if you want to also access the additional viewing levels, you walk down what almost feels like a staircase that will take you out to a seedy bar. While the view is still spectacular, it's not the same as when you have less people in the revolving floor above.

They always are eager to hand out free samples, and by free samples, I mean GOOD free samples....not the ""bagel bites"" free samples that you get at Sam's Club.  Last time we stopped in they were handing out an aged cheese that had been soaked in Syrah, as well as a sample of a good wine pairing to accompany the cheese.  Needless to say, I walked out of the store with both a bottle of the wine and a wedge of the cheese.

Which is a great segway into their wine selection!  I have never been very fond of the ""Two Buck Chuck"", but they have some other wines in the 5-7 price range that are simply great!  I'm by no means a wine snob, but I was always wary of the bargain basement wine deals that have flooded the markets recently.  TJ's has made me a believer in the philosophy that you don't have to drop $30 to get a decent bottle of vino.

We figured we'd get lunch while we were in the area.  Our original plan of one of the breweries was vetoed due to noise, but luckily my husband remembered having liked the steak frites at Bier Mrkt on a business trip last year, so we ended up in its next door neighbor, Bar Centro.

The ambiance is modern, classy, and importantly for this visit, not loud.  Their beer menu is impressive-- both a lot of local brews on tap and some more traditional options in bottles.  The wine and mixed drink menus looked great as well.  Prices are reasonable; twelve-inch pizzas range from $8-$15 (could be single serving, or shared if you order a side dish) and most entrees were in the $20-$29 range.  

Everyone seemed to enjoy their food options.  We had:
--house salad: nothing out of the ordinary, but a great vinaigrette and nice fresh greens.
--pickles: I don't like pickles, but this mini platter had a variety of pickled vegetables, all brined with different spices, and my husband said it was good.
--spicy chicken pizza: if you have a good heat tolerance, calling this spicy is a stretch, but we really enjoyed it.  The chicken sausage had great flavor and the crust was delicious.
--marinara pizza with pepperoni: I didn't taste this one but apparently it was great.
--mussels and frites:  he didn't seem crazy about the mussels, but they looked good to me, and the fries were fantastic.

It was a bit to sweet but the flavor of the tea itself was nice and strong but overpowered by the sweetness. Our waitress was also more then happy to make my son some red lemonade and even put some cherries in it for him. To start I choose the chicken skewers. The seasoning on the chicken was tasty but the chicken itself I found dry. The peanut sauce was very flavorful but a bit to oily for my liking. My boy had a hand full of bites before he said he was done and just wanted to eat his peanut sauce. For my main course I had thai basil chicken. It was very good. The chicken was moist and the basil was fresh as were the peppers and onion in it. The veggie spring roll that came with it was crispy and delicious. I wish the chicken skewers would have came out first but all the food pretty much came out at the same time. The service was good and I never found myself wanting or waiting.

When my plate arrived, it looked great!  The kebobs were fragrant and the salad was nice and colorful with shredded beets and carrots.  The mixed platter ($18.95) had juicy chicken kebob and spiced beef and lamb which I smothered in garlicy yogurt.

Their AYCE menu is split up into three categories. Nevada (~$15.99) has the basics of KBBQ: beef brisket, pork belly, marinated chicken, and a few other meats. Vegas (~$19.99) and the last option (~$23.99) offer more protein goodness like beef tongue, spicy marinated meats, and large intestine. You can't go wrong with any of them, really. It's meat. 

Kimchi, sliced fish cakes, bean sprouts, broccoli, marinated jalapeños, and potato salad make up their banchan. Pretty standard quality and flavor. Wish that I got to try their steamed egg though. They don't have rice paper, so you can either chow down on salad or order rice.

Service was inconsistent considering that my coworkers and I were some of the few diners that evening. They would bring the meats and banchan out quickly, but didn't respond to our repeated requests for water. I know we're in the desert and all, but should we really have to ask several times?

The atmosphere here is one of my favorite parts of it.  There are walls of windows looking out over uptown Charlotte.  The dining room is small and open.  It's nice, but very casual and earthy.  I love the tables, they are made of what looks like huge thinly cut tree stumps.  That is probably giving you a very weird visual, but it'll make sense once you see them.  You also have the Mint Museum right there and you don't even have to walk outside to go to it.

The cocktail menu is the most unique list you will find anywhere.  You'll see all kinds of original concoctions that are created by the on-staff mixologist who is basically a genius.  For food, there are lots of offerings that you won't find at many restaurants (rabbit sausage anyone?) as well as some Southern classics like shrimp and grits.  The most recent dish I had there was the duck confit.  It was truly outstanding.  Fresh ingredients, tender meat, and loaded with flavor.

I made a mental note and planned on visiting because I need a pair jeans and maybe a shirt.  Most of my wardrobe consists of business casual attire.  Which is funny because if you have every worked a fast food gig before you remember saying how much you hate the monkey suit they gave you to wear.  At least that's how I felt when I was a teenager.  Well, fast forward to the future and if you work in an office you are back to that ""monkey suit.""  It's a just a more sophisticated uniform.  I may have gone a little off there.  Let me reel myself in to why I went to Old Navy.  

I wanted to check the place out because Old Navy is everywhere and there stuff is the same all over the United States.  As I walked in I was greeted by the associates.  When I approached the men's section I had to check my calendar because this place looked like the day after thanksgiving.  The selection was limited, granted it was a Sunday afternoon when I went.  I looked around for a few minutes because that's all it took.  There was no merchandise.  I saw about 250 hooded zipper sweatshirts.  I think maybe they had a big shipment or this jacket isn't very popular with the Albuquerque crowd.  I need to try and go again.  I may see a better selection before the weekend.  Old Navy does have some great prices on their clothing. So if you are in the area go check it out.  If there is no merchandise in the store, don't panic they didn't have a robbery!

N-SeNWR_q_KXaXvCc9vESQ,mVrNLm-_IeJ3MABgqjEvvQ,u6biYZCSOwyQ-WmXqQbbQA,3,5,2,1,"I live in the neighborhood of the Newton--and have anxiously awaited the opening of all the components.  Had dinner with a friend last night and we did all the recommended dishes:  fried green tomatoes, watermelon salad, and the duck and coconut cake for dessert.  I thought all the food was pretty good.  I was a little disappointed about not being able to taste/find the sausage that was in the rice that came with the duck--it would have added a nice little spice.  The coconut cake was terrific and a nice ending to the meal.

The reason for the three are things with a little work could be fixed:
1. The restaurant is noisy--I think there is a trend that somehow the noise is supposed to be an indicator of coolness--it is a decision that restaurants have to make--it is loud but wasn't intolerable.
2.  The service was just off--sometimes very attentive and sometimes a desert.  If you are going to suggest splitting a dish that has rice--then by all means bring a spoon out so one doesn't have to transfer the rice from one plate to another grain by grain with a knife and a fork--Obviously we would have asked for a spoon had the waiter not been in the desert mode at the time.
3.  Again if people are splitting plates--have the good sense to bring out clean small plates between courses--they were not offered and we could not ask because again we were in the waiter desert at the moment we needed them.  
4.  In my mind, unless specifically requested, an appetizer and a salad are two different courses and should be served separately so there is time to enjoy them.
5.  We had a little bit of the pimento spread left over from the tomatoes and asked from some bread.  What we got was something that was spongy and white on the inside and had barely a crust on the outside--I would certainly not call it bread.  A restaurant at this level has no excuse for serving yucky bread--if you are going to serve it should be able to stand on its own as well as being a complement to whatever it is going with.  A great tasty rye would have been wonderful for the left over pimento or even a robust baguette, but certainly not what we got. 

Southern Rail--I really want you to get to your act together --you are such a welcome addition to the neighborhood--It won't take much--but you have to start paying attention to the details.  Our little corner of the world is pretty competitive--I can just as easily walk east or west as walk south--Please step up your game so I want to head south on a regular basis.",2014-07-05 02:01:08

If you have been then you know how beautiful it is! It's a historic landmark! It was built in the 20s and beautifully restored to its original state in the 80s. In my opinion there isn't a bad seat in the house. On my last trip I sat in the very last row and still fully enjoyed the show. If you want to pay more for a better seat go for it but for $25 last row isn't bad at all. They have so many workers on hand to help you to your seat and to get the crowds moving in and out. All the workers are nice and polite. I had an issue with my tickets on my last trip. I explained to the man at the box office the issue (it was a very busy night as usual) and he took care of it right away for me. You can purchase alcohol here but if you want to take it into the theater it's an extra $3.50 for a sippy cup. They should serve it that way to begin with because who really has the time or wants to hang out and sip a drink before the show. I'd much rather enjoy a drink during the performance. Support local Pittsburgh theater or see a touring Broadway show here either way you can't go wrong.

I actually ordered the soup filled dumplings again for ""dessert"" cause they were that good.  Seriously, if you only order one thing here order the soup filled dumplings.

I came in here looking for soup filled dumplings, that's pretty much it.  I decided to give some of the other things a try, so we also ordered the drunken chicken, the pork and chive dumplings, chunky chill beef noodles and steamed pork buns.

The drunken chicken came first and I have to tell you that I wish they actually spent some time making this.  It seemed like they just poured alcohol on the chicken afterwards cause it tasted bitter afterwards because of the alcohol (yuk).

The chunky beef noodles were pretty neat cause they used handmade noodles, but the broth was really bland and the beef was not at all tender.  Too bad.  As for the pork and chive dumplings, they were alright.  The dough on them was really silky, but I found that they put way too much chive in there to my liking.  I don't think there was much pork in there at all.  As for the pork buns, they were about average.

Now, what makes their soup dumplings so good?  First of all, the dough is really thin, but not so thin that it falls apart when you pick them up.  Second, the pork filling is probably the smoothest, tenderest filling I've ever had.  They pretty much melt in your mouth.  Third, there is no third, it's awesome just order it.

In my opinion, I think this place is really only good for their dim sum or ""appetizer"" dishes.  Every one of our entrees kinda sucked.  I'd love to give this place more stars but I can't justify it on one dish.  But then again, it's an amazing dish.  You already know what you're going to order when you come here.

It was a smokey/spicy mezcal drink.  Quite tasty.  My date ordered the in house soda on tap, which was sort of like a ginger tonic.  Subtle, but yet flavorful.  Pretty awesome honestly.  As we ran our eyes up and down this extensive but not over the top menu we had quite a few questions.  Knowing how slammed they were we went with the cell phone over keeping our server from being able to do what she needed to.  With a mix of small plates and large, this place is perfect for sharing.  Not necessarily tapas, but could easily be eaten that way.

First came out the milk bread.  A must, especially if you order something like the mussels.  Just perfect doughiness, hard to say much else.  Then came the salumi plate.  3 types of sausage, all top notch, with the N'duja being something not quite like I ever had before.  Similar to a soft spicy chorizo, but more tender.  Next we had the Yellowtail crudo.  Simple, but yet amazing.  Super subtle flavor on the fish, lightly highlighted by the accoutrements of grapefruit, fennel pollen, and some type of dehydrated or reduced olives.  Lightly drizzled with olive oil.  Highly recommended.

We didn't want all our food at once so we got those 2 plates and then 2 more.  The next round features the mussels and the scallops, which was listed as a large plate.  The mussels were really good, but not quite life changing, like everything else I had so far.  The broth was flavorful, but I needed more toast points to soak it up.  There were some flavors there I didn't recognize, so maybe my palate just wasn't sophisticated enough to appreciate them to their fullest.  Then came the scallops.  WOW.  I can hands down say that was the most tender and perfectly cooked scallop that I've ever had in Charlotte area.  The sunchoke and dashi puree was quite subtle, but I get it, don't overpower the scallop.  An amazing dish, that said I am glad our server told us that it wasn't that big of a plate, because I wouldn't consider it big enough to constitute as an entree.

After all this we were full, but not stuffed, so we went with a dessert.  The Sweet Tea Madeleines were great.  A tasty little French cake with a citrus cream and pine.  Just the perfect way to end the evening.

I'll be back, and probably be a regular.  Can't wait to rent out the chef's tasting room downstairs.",2015-02-20 04:22:22

Don't get me wrong, the pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was just OK. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it, and my plate wasn't covered in orange grease when I was done., which is another positive. 

But the pizza, which started out as great, became increasingly boring piece after piece. I don't know how this is possible, but both the sauce and the crust lost some, or rather most of their punch after it cooled down a bit. 

We ordered a  1/2 carafe of their house red and it was lovely, and the service we experienced was exceptional. No complaints there.

We have an Instant Karma Star Rating Upgrade for Nicantoni's. {please see Vic's comments below} Anytime an establishment reaches out with a plan to work with you... well it's just the Hallmark of stratospheric customer service. Big Thanks to Vic. His solution: Tell us you want the Roni's cut up and distributed on the Pizza. Brilliant!

Orig Review...

Got Door Dash delivery. Nicantoni's gets an extra star for outstanding achievements in:
--Sauce tastiness and consistency
--Cheese ratio and delectable gooeyness
--Dough texture and scrumptiocity (yup, had to create a whole new word to cover my sentiments there) 
--Being the best NY pizza alternative since Prima closed (RIP {tear falls}).

Very sadly though, Nicantoni's strays from perfection with the size of their pepperoni. These monsters are approx 2.5"" in diameter. I think we ALL know that pepperoni, like nipples, have an ideal max size. Lost your 5th star here guys. The sparse application of pepperoni further aggravates the situation. C'mon... there's stylistic difference that's good and sets you apart from... and above, the rest. And then there's stylistic difference that makes your clientele tilt their heads like the RCA dog and say: ""wow that pizza would have been better had they not done that."" We're talkin' pizza here guys not Picasso. A couple eyes or noses placed asymmetrically on the side of a face might be interesting to look at. But applied to pizza? Such misguided artistry is a poor approach to pizza ingredient/cheese balance and homogeneity.

Lemme break it down in a less crassly-humorous and less pedantic fashion. The situation is this: when a person orders a pepperoni pizza, they expect a certain cheese to pepperoni ratio. There is an expectation that pepperoni will visit their taste buds about every other bite or so. A Nicantoni's pepperoni pizza can, and likely will, feature a single, lone third-of-a-piece of Roni off to the edge of a slice. So, the customer gnaws through 80-90% of that slice before EVER tasting pepperoni. Yeah, so thinking it through... your 4th star, the extra one, is in jeopardy. 

Was the pizza tasty? Oh yeah. Better than any other NY-Style around? Roger that. But the Pep thing is weird and not what I expect or enjoy in my pizza. Honesty, I would be tempted to order a plain cheese, take it home and add my own pepperoni. But then, I'm working too hard. Sigh.

Another southward contributor to the star rating is the subpar Wing game. 'Twas bad in both sauce and texture. A true low note in an otherwise splendid delivery experience. I acknowledge that delivery is not an optimal or fair wing evaluation method. Delivered wings tend to arrive less crispy for certain. However, sauce taste is unaffected by delivery... and it is this criterion I found unacceptably off-putting. Nicantoni's, please up your wing sauce game. Damn. Down to 3 Stars. Sorry guys. But it's all so recoverable. 

I'll give you guys another whirl in a month or two. 

Friends and neighbors, apologies for the anatomical reference above.  It's just too fitting to remove. And if we all loosen up just a bit, we can ALL certainly agree that nipple rule applies far more stringently to males. OK, perhaps that was too far. What can I say? I'm weak.",2018-02-17 11:36:40

First of all, they have a very good beer (bottle and draft) selection, and a full bar.  Always a plus.

Great apps - we shared the calamari and the fried mozz.  We don't usually get fried mozz, but this place has some of the best we've ever had.

The salads are pretty good, too.  They have a large salad that my wife and I split, and still had enough to take home.  Those who have commented on the house Italian are right on the money - it is very good.

We shared some pizza.  One minor complaint here is that my wife ordered meatball and it appears we got sausage instead.  Still tasted okay, though.  In general, the pizzas are very good.  I have had their sheet pizzas on other occasions, and they are also outstanding.

The biggest complaint would be regarding the shrimp tacos I ordered.  The waitress gave me her recommendation, and although they looked appetizing, they were only so-so.  I thought the idea of tacos at an Italian restaurant was strange, and I should have stuck with my gut.  Maybe the others are better...all I know is I'll be having some pasta next time.

So following my normal habits, my friend and I sat at the sushi bar and asked the sushi chef to simply feed me what he would like, ""omakase"" style. He seemed happy enough about this... and made some fairly tasty rolls, albeit nothing extravagant and all pretty basic items from the menu. Given that I told him the only thing I wouldn't eat was octopus, I somewhat expected him to be a little more creative. Generally that is what's to be expected from omakase. But, this was my first time there, so it was excusable. He didn't know my taste.

We ended up having 4 rolls in all, and then when I was about ready to ask for some sashimi to finish up, he hands us some nigiri; 2 pieces each of salmon and ahi tuna. Okay, cool, that works just as well. This is his choice, after all. Unfortunately this is where the low rating comes from. I entrusted him to showcase his selection.... and this fish he gave me was not fresh. It was slimy. It had hardly any flavor at all; the predominant flavors came from the rice and the tiny dab of wasabi binding the fish to it. I had to wash both pieces of nigiri down with water and tea.

To me, the true measure of a sushi restaurant is in its sashimi and/or nigiri. And this is unfortunately where Sushi Eye fell flat on its face in my experience.

I got a custard flauta in matcha and the pastry was flaky, not too sweet, and had strong hints of matcha reminiscent of their soft serve. For a limited time, any drink purchase also gets you a mini pastry so I got a tasty little palmier with my genmaicha tea. 

Their pastries are cute, though their selection doesn't seem very large. I see the potential for more flavours later on. I also think they can make the presentation a bit tighter. For example, some of the cream on top of the mont blancs seem to be a little lopsided. Definitely not a deal breaker, as I'm sure everything is still delicious but it'll better match the clean, pristine feel of the rest of the place. 

It's still early in their opening, so I haven't seen many people inside yet. Once they get that social media hype going, like with Tendou, I'm sure there'll be more. The more pastry shops in Markham, the better. Go, go, Kirin! I'm rooting for you!

are you SURE a larger party will come in?  no. are we not worthy of a seat because there aren't 5 us? well, according to stax that's the case.

The pizza was huge. The crust was great, crispy on the edges and a medium thickness. The sauce was thicker and a bit tangy. There was a lot, A LOT, of cheese on the pizza. This caused a lot of grease. In all fairness, this was a great pizza for the size and the price. Was it in my top five pizzas of all time? No way. I'd opt for less sauce and cheese next time.

Since their opening, I've tried plenty of their menu items. With my go to being the West Coast. It's savory and refreshing (thanks to the avocado). Other notable favorites include Kisses and the Red Velvet Waffle for those with a sweet tooth.

The only thing about this place is that you never know what to expect with service. There are times when it would be swift, friendly, and efficient. You are going to be welcomed with a bright smile from the cashier and get your order in a reasonable time. But there are times when you are greeted with a blank, cold stare as if you've obviously interrupted them with their cleaning and get your order after a longer than usual wait.

Food was good, we were six people and that gave us the opportunity to taste all the appetizers, all of which were well done and tasted great.

The service was odd at best, the wait staff at the table was good, no complaints there whatsoever, however the bartenders left much to be desired. When we entered the restaurant we were about 15 minutes early for our table and all of us wanted to have a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, we were constantly asked if we could go sit at our table, and only 3 out of 6 of us were actually served at the bar. My friend deduced they wanted us to clear the bar for people that may have come for drinks only. This is the first time this has ever opened to me and was not acceptable. To top it off, after we had been hurried to our table, pre-ordered drinks were not even sent to the table and upon inquiry we were asked politely to order from the drinks menu at the table (the Bourbon based El Chengon (spelling?) was delicious). All I can say is this may have been due to teething pains as it is a new restaurant, customer service was being traded for operational efficiency, hence the 3 stars and not worse, as the mostly great food offset the service issues.

The hibachi is good.  The food is good.  It really comes down to the chefs.  They have a couple chefs that put on a crazy good show.  If you get one of them, you are in luck.  They each seem to have their quirks.  It isn't the typical show of a little bit of flame and a shrimp tail in the hat.

The sushi bar and regular bar are where Nakama really shines.  Nakama has a great bar scene and good sushi.  The sushi isn't the best in the city, but it is well done.  The fish to rice ratio is great and they have a diverse selection of pretty sushi rolls for people who want to go beyond your standard single fish product and rice.

I'd strongly recommend Nakama if you want some good sushi and drinks in a upscale busy bar environment.  If you are looking for an 'authentic' sushi / hibachi experience, this is not the place.  Nakama fits the Southside scene.  You hit Nakama before a club or party bar.",2014-10-03 13:07:46

15 mins go by and another server came up to me and gave me a menu Again and said sorry we're so busy.. can I take your order? I'm like... I ordered 15 mins ago and repeated what I ordered to her and said.. do you have my order placed? She acted like it was and said oh yes they're working on it. Another 10 mins go by and it's hard not to see me sitting at the counter staring at 6+ staff members going in and out of the kitchen with food and to go orders. I must be invincible?! Asian girl with icy blonde hair isn't exactly that hidden.

After another 10 mins... yeah I know they're really testing my patience. Then, the same server, who gave me the menu again 10 mins ago came back to me and asked.. what did you order again? I told her and mins again are going by. 

I get up from the counter seating and wait, yet again.. this time by the cashier. I see the girl that took my order 35 mins ago and ask her what happened to my order? She apologized and said the kitchen was busy?! I told her how long is it going to be??? And she said another 10 mins... uhm I have no time for that and told her to cancel my order and I'll just pay for this vietnamese ice coffee. She goes.. you don't want your macaroons either? Hmmm waiting almost 45 mins and you asking if I still want my macaroons lol?!?!! No cancel everything. 

She goes I'll remember you and everything will be on the house next time. It would be proper to fix things right then and there, because after that experience... why would I even want to come back for a next time?! I said no thanks, paid for my coffee, and left.

Hungry and not having anytime to eat now, but this strong brewed bitter vietnamese iced coffee I've been sippin' on for over 40 mins. Feelin' real ill leaving this place and I didn't even get to taste anything! Just this coffee that's turning up my system. Wonderful.

For a new business, there are still many things that needs to be addressed and worked out. Good luck in fixing those, especially waiting for sandwiches that should take no longer than 10 mins. Full staff, watching other guests come in AFTER me, getting and finishing their meal.. Even leaving before me is no excuse of the ""kitchen was busy"" for me to wait that long and then want me to wait another 10 mins?! I have places to go and people to see. I don't have time to wait another 10 mins, which could possibly turn out to be another 40+ mins!?!! Forget that. I didn't order a damn well done steak smh. 

I finally found another time slot to eat after missing lunch earlier from this place. Having my whole family waiting too, after telling them don't eat, I'm bringing home some sandwiches, which Never made it home. Having not only me, but my family starve, because it got really busy there.. didn't sit with me well. Pho Vietnam Grille Express... Saved my day. Shaking from hunger.. I got my Fried Pork Spring Rolls AND Pork Chops in guess what... less than 10 mins tops with exceptional service added to that! Also I didn't have to wait a century for to go orders!",2016-01-13 00:25:06

Wednesday are Double Ad Wednesday, meaning the sales from last week and this week are in effect! I usually try to go on Wednesday, but of course, it is a lot more busier on Wednesdays. The quality of the vegetables aren't always the best, but you need to do some digging. I see the same quality fruits and veggies at my local Smiths for at least a $1-2 more! Compared to Fresh & Easy, I don't have to worry about the products that I buy being expired. (Happened to me one too many times at F&E)

They have pre-made foods & soups. I once got their homemade hummus and it was AWFUL! That was the last time I ever bought anything from that pre-made section. I should have returned it because, honestly it tasted like feet to put it nicely. 

I love the bulk food section where they have nuts, seeds, legumes, grains, flour, sugar, snacks, etc. They have a pretty decent section of wines and alcohol as well. 

I love that they have pretty decent quality fresh produce as well as bulk all for an affordable price compared to Whole Foods which always leaves me broke and unsatisfied!",2010-07-27 19:49:21

Just got back from enjoying a late-ish bite here on a Saturday night, and it was deserted.  Too bad!  My posse and I appreciated the music - some pretty random Sirius station played at a dominating but not overly loud volume.  

I tried a new menu item, the chili, and was blown away.  Fantastic.  I couldn't decide if I liked the hearty chunks of steak, or the strips of turkey better.  The beans and veggies were good, and the overall flavor was not too spicy or over-the-top, which is how I like it.  A cup is a smoking deal at under three dollars.  

I tried the pepperoni, and as boring as it sounds, I think I have a new fave here.  The flavors balance perfectly - tomato sauce, mozzarella, and the sausage itself, plus the amazing burnt crust.  I noticed today for the first time that the crust includes a sourdough flavor - subtle, but it's there.  Mmmmhmm.  

We finished the night out with a pizza cookie.  Solid, but I won't remember it later as particularly stand-out.  I look forward to the revised dessert menu coming hopefully soon to see what varieties of pizza cookie they offer and what else they're going to add back.

The highlights:
- Waterloo, an ABBA tribute band playing the night I was there, was amazing.  They did a great job and had the audience dancing in the aisles.  
- The food was a festival of deep-fried, artery-hardening goodness that you can only find at fairs and some sports events.  
- I tried my first ever funnel cake.  Yes, it was good
- I purchased a corn dog from a vendor that was missing his front teeth and wanted a sip of my beer.  No, I did not give him one.


The not-so-great:
- $20 to park!?  I am not familiar with the area and probably could have done better on this one.
- Where were the cows!? You cannot have a fair without COWS!  I saw a large building filled with llamas, but no cows.  Another building, that may have had them was closed.  :(

Overall I am glad I went, but maybe should have gone during the day to be able to see more exhibits.  In the evening it is more like a really crowded and kind of dirty amusement park, but with drunk people.

We ordered 3 drinks and a lunch combo, the drinks came fast but the food took forever, seems like there was only 1 person working in the kitchen. We ordered cold mango yogurt drink, cold regular bubble tea and a hot tea. The drinks were very disappointing, especially for the price which they charge. Cheapest drink you can find on the menu is $5, but that's just plain small size bubble tea. For that price there's way more choices for the quality you get. Toppings are $1 extra. The mango yogurt drink tasted like mango syrup in ice, it was very disappointing. The regular bubble tea was nothing special but for that price, I can easily get better elsewhere. Also the hot drink was nothing impressing either.

The food came on a small plate where everything is little in portion. Definitely felt more like a snack than a lunch because it was not filling at all! Taste of the food was just average, not worth the price paid for it!

We tried the salt and vinegar (not my fave), white cheddar (give me more), Ranch (everyone else loved this one, I personally hate all things ranch), and several chocolate varieties which were excellent.  

The only reason this place doesn't get that elusive 5th star is because they don't offer affordable options for mixing flavors.  Even a small sampler wheel like other establishments would have been nice.  They do have a 3 popcorn option where they put a divider into a tin.  They will mix more flavors in but some will have to touch.  The benefit of the 3 flavor tin is it is priced at the average price of the three flavors so if you get one of each price level, you pay the middle price.  Still, I wanted to take home a sampling of all their flavors and they could not accomodate.",2014-05-19 12:58:34

I had the lamb burger, which was incredible. The flavor of the meat was just amazing and the toppings complemented it perfectly. The bun was soft, fresh and flavorful.  I had Parmesan truffle fries as the side - and OMG. I could not stop eating them! The calamari for starters was delish, as well. I look forward to going back and making my way through all of the burgers. Next on my list? The Kobe burger. 
I feed my son an all-natural diet - and there were no concerns here. The meat is all free-range and grass-fed - no nitrates or antibiotics.

Note, they only take reservations for groups of six or more for the front window table.  The rest of the seating is first come, first served.  This was not a problem when we arrived around 7pm.  We were able to grab one of the last available booths near the back.

Our friendly server dropped off menus and then came back for drink orders.  We got 2 glasses of wine ($10/each) and once we heard the specials, we ordered the steak frites entree ($21) and the special trout appetizer ($11).  One of the dinner specials was a burger topped with mac&cheese ($13) which I thought was intriguing.

Atmosphere was old school diner, definitely kitchy and cute.  A bustling dining room filled with lots of hungry patrons, just like the days of yore.

Not too long of a wait for our meals.  The steak frites was excellent.  Steak done medium rare as requested and the fresh cut fries were good as well.  The meaty gravy that coated the steak tasted great on the fries.  The trout appetizer came on a bed of salad.  Simple but good, my DC wished it came in an entree size.

For dessert, we had to try some of the homemade ice creams ($4/each).  We got the Mexican hot chocolate and the raspberry sorbet.  The hot chocolate flavor had a hint of cinammon and the raspberry was tart but refreshing.  Both great and the two tiny scoops of each didn't last too long.

Ventilation in the Ace could be improved.  We sat close to the open kitchen and when we left, we were wearing the scent of our dinners.  It required a full body shower and airing of my coat outside to get rid of the smells.

As soon as we payed our bill, we were requested by another server to vacate our table and finish up at the bar so that new customers could be seated.  I understand the importance of turnover on a busy night and I respect it.  We were on our way out and not intending to linger but give me a chance to put on my jacket.  DC was not impressed, felt like we were being ushered out the door.

Everything else was a definitely a one-star! Let's start with the ""clam chowder"" - it was liquefied mashed potatoes with a couple of clam pieces thrown in. Next came the ""caprese salad"" - it was 3 cherry tomatoes uncut, 3 small mozzarella balls uncut, lots of crustini, balsamic sprinkled with dry basil & side salad w/dressing... all on a 7 inch plate for $8. Then came the main sandwich dishes: rib-eye steak with leek fondue on a ciabatta ordered medium rare - came on wheat french bread, 3 small pieces of dry, well-done SIRLOIN steak, the sauce was absorbed into the bread & nothing else. 2nd plate was a veggie sandwich - which wasn't bad, we split it as the steak sandwich was not good. Now let's talk about the fries, partially uncooked, extremely oily, wilted, have to say they looked good but were completely inedible!!
So we came here on a Groupon deal & when it was time to pay - the bartender girl shorted us $6 & called it a Deal Chicken. I was polite in confronting her and she was extremely rude in her response. She said the computer would not let her discount alcohol. I told her the Groupon did not exclude alcohol therefore she should apply our entire discount. She was angry & said she would talk to manager. Well, obviously he gave us what was RIGHT! She didn't even look at me when she handed me the new bill. 

Now let's talk about the good things... our waiter Cord, oh what a saving grace at this place, we wished he would find a more promising job! We left him a higher than average tip to show him that we appreciated his service! Also we tried a beer that we have been curious about, Session beer (light & dark)- it was surprisingly tasty & a nice find. We will be purchasing that in the future!

During my first visit, I had a meal, but this time I wanted to actually try their cheesecakes. My friend always raves about how delicious they are and that I must try one!

This place has a pretty wide selection of cakes, so it's a bit tough to choose because they all look delicious. My friend ordered her usual, the turtles chocolate cheesecake and I decided to try the triple c (triple chocolate). My goodness, the first bite was incredible! I was honestly afraid of my choice a bit, because I don't really like the taste of chocolate cheesecake...but this was so good! It didn't have that weird cheesy taste that I dread. It just tasted like amazing rich chocolate. It wasn't too sweet, since it has a layer of dark chocolate. It was apparently on Food Factory on the food network, which is pretty cool! I tried my friend's slice and it was also very good, but I was very happy with my choice. We also ordered tea, which came with a lot of hot water and refills!

The lady at the front, who I believe may be the owner, was extremely helpful in helping me pick my slice. She was really sweet and joked around a lot, making it a very pleasant visit overall. My only concern with this place and reason for 4/5 was the seating. There is a lot of awkward seating, which I unfortunately don't know how to describe very well for you. My friend and I sat right across from another table and felt like we were intruding into their conversation and I had to somehow sit in a corner...we ended up switching over to the bar. 

Overall, I would say this is definitely a great place to have dessert. If you love cheesecake, this is a must try. It's a bit expensive, as my bill came up to a little less than 13$ for the slice and tea. However, I would say it's worth it to try once or so throughout the year.",2014-10-17 05:20:12

I have to say that they found a great location for their bricks and mortar restaurant. And the ambience is clean yet eclectic with lots of clever little touches... like the fire hydrants on the outside of the bathroom doors.

The beer selection adds to the already stellar fare (who doesn't like a beer with their hot dog?) and is appropriately focused on craft beer and local breweries.  As for the food, I've raved in the past about their signature dogs served in flatbreads... but now I've found a new favorite.  The beer hot sausage done up as the Bear is amazing.  Imagine smoked gouda, peanut butter, BBQ sauce, bacon and caramel corn all together with a spicy sausage, and you have the makings of a gourmet classic.  I can't seem to order anything else when I visit. 

Sidenote: I tried the currywurst and was a bit disappointed. Maybe I'm overly critical having grown up in Germany, but the curry ketchup on this dog (while seemingly house-made) lacks the sweet and spicy punch that defines the true German street food classic.

The corn pups are also a great starter. I like that they seem to include a mixture of the traditional hot dog and Schneider's jalapeño cheese sausage in the corn pups.  It makes each one a little bit of a surprise. If they really want to elevate this dish (even though it's already great), they should consider sourcing the jalapeño cheese brats from Von Hanson's in the East Valley. If you read my review on Von Hanson's, you will find that I have an undying love for this particular sausage.

Pop over to Atlas to grab a bottle of beer or cider to enjoy while you watch your movie at Row House - they allow you to bring drinks over, which is a huge plus!

Row House is always impeccably well-kept and clean. The theater is quiet, and the sound and projection are both top notch. The movie selection at Row House truly has something for everyone. Each month Row House puts out a new brochure that shows their lineup for the coming weeks. I love that Row House shows movies from all different decades and genres. I've come to Row House to see both chick flicks and classics. Most recently I came with a couple friends to see Inception during the Leonardo DiCaprio tribute, which was so much fun!

Whether you're looking to see an old classic or a new movie that you've never seen before, you need to get yourself to Row House and experience a quality cinema experience as soon as possible. I, for one, will definitely be back soon!",2016-02-18 00:14:19

The 7:30pm crowds looped around the line dividers as if they were waiting for the newest Disneyland ride. We were seated in about 50-55 minutes.

This buffet is humongous; I think I read there are over 200 items which made me think it might be a quantity over quality type of place, but that wasn't the case. Food was actually really fresh. 

There are the different sections: asian, pastas & pizzas, sushi, Indian, the carving station, the seafood area, etc. I'm not usually a pasta fan, but the baked ziti was SO good. I kept going back for more of that tart & creamy sauce. The breading on the fried shrimp were not too crisp. I had a pork rib which had a nicely-spiced rub & was not too fatty. For dessert, I loaded up on mini red velvet cupcakes (yay for cream cheese frosting!)

Three stars because I normally wouldn't drive too far from the strip for a buffet with a longass line. I had a handful of pretty good items but everything else was not memorable. I ended my meal with an espresso shot laced with amaretto. I'm thinking a lot of high ratings are given because wine & beer are included in the price of your meal. I'm not a beer & wine kinda gal, so that perk was completely wasted on me. Now, had vodka been flowing freely, I might also be inclined to give a high rating...",2011-11-07 04:19:21

We went to Station Street a week or so ago, while we were buying some things for the house at Target. I had heard about the place from several friends, and despite the fact that we haven't yet been able to make it to Salt of the Earth, felt that we would like to try Chef Sousa's craft. It did not disappoint.

I liked the totally retro feel to the place, evident from the minute you pull into the place - it looks like one of those old-school fast food joints from the 50's, with lots of window space, and a large central kitchen. We tried the Banh-mi dog and the chili-cheese dog to have a traditional dog and creative dog between the two of us - both were delicious. The nice thing is, they actually remembered that they opened a HOT DOG place, and start everything off with great HOT DOGS! Lots of newer restaurants that try a spin on an old favorite fall flat on their faces because they can't get the basics right. Not so here; they nail both the dog and the bun, at least as far as we were concerned. The toppings were great, and I must admit, the bang-mi dog was better than I had expected. Their poutine was great too, although the gravy was a tad too salty for us. The curds they used were great, though!

It won't be too long before we go back, hopefully to try the sweetbread dog and a few of the other interesting items, like the Korean BBQ and Tacos. Lots of great ways to hit a home run here!

Only two other minor points of improvement - the seating is a bit sparse for such a large place - It's nice to sit and gaze out the window, but the setup might make it hard for larger groups to get comfortable. (they do have a table for a group of 8 or so over on the far end of the restaurant...) Pricing - our meal came out to $25 dollars for 2 cokes, 2 dogs, and one order of poutine.

Turns out my sandwich did not include cheese which was extra even though it was not presented this way and the menu makes no mention of it.  It also does not show as an add on the receipt.  Also turns out our server rang up a different but very similar pasta dish than what my wife ordered.  We got sorry both mistakes were my fault from the server and sorry the menu is confusing from the manager but no offer to take responsibility for it.  They basically said we screwed up but you are still paying for our mistakes.  Left a very bad taste for both my wife and I.  We eat out a lot and there are far too many good places to eat in Phoenix than to eat at one that is at best poorly trained and presented and at worst misleading and still refuses responsibility when they admit they have done wrong.  For $2, they have lost two customers for life.

This last time that I was in here, I got two strawberry cupcakes-- the cake was moist, delicious and had the taste of fresh strawberries.

There was too much frosting, sounds like sacrilege I know, but the frosting is very thick, tastes a little like shortening (weird) because the flavor of the strawberry is so light... BUT when I took half of the frosting off and smoothed the rest onto the cupcake, it was JUST the right amount of yum!

This is a family owned business and you can definitely tell they use fresh ingredients. Always a plus. 
I had heard a lot of hype about this place, but I'm usually not to keen on the ""new hip"" place. I hate going to newer restaurants when they're busy and just crowed with people. Of course, that's what they want :) I've had a lot of people tell me that they like places just because they're new and cool - not because of the food. So I was kind of nervous, especially because the food here is not on the cheaper side. 

For dinner we had - 

New England Fry - Clams and Calamari 
Caramelized Sea Scallops
Grass-fed Filet Mignon 
Side of their well known Kale and Anaheim pepper Mac & Cheese

I will tell you, I was not disappointed with ANY of the dishes. The clams and calamari were cooked perfectly and they weren't like rubber like you find at a lot of places around town. 
The Scallops where amazing. The had this vanilla bean cauliflower puree and true sauce that really made the dish absolutely delightful. 
The mignon was cooked perfectly as asked and have a very distinguished taste. 
And on to my favorite - the Mac & Cheese. Never have I had kale in my mac & cheese, but my goodness...it was quite a charming surprise! It has a nice spicy cheese sauce from the peppers and it so was nice and creamy. Perfect combination!

They have a really nice ""homey"" feeling to the restaurant. Very creative decor and they have good service. They were booked, so if you go in when it's that busy, do expect a bit of a delay. DEFINITELY make a reservation before going in for dinner. They also have a large variety of specialty drinks!

This day I just couldn't resist the temptation of their baked goods and went for a visit.  The very first thing I noticed in the store was (of course) their beautiful display. Savoury baked goods, chocolates, macaroons, ecliars, and mini cakes; you name it, they have it. 

It took me awhile to sink in and actually see what they have to offer. Finally, I got a box of macaroons and three mini cakes (Strawberry Cheesecake, Lemon Meringue Tart, and Lime Matcha Pistachio Slab).

The Strawberry Cheesecake was the best out of the three cakes. It was light and fluffy. The cheese flavour was to the point, and it did not overpower the strawberries. I love the jello texture in the middle of the cake. It adds a touch to the overall texture of the cake. I have to say the strawberry on top was not fresh. You can see the leaf was yellow/brown, which ruined the presentation of the cake. I personally think that they could have used fresher fruits or they could at least take off the yellow/brown leaf on the strawberry. The base of the cheesecake was made out of ingredients similar to ganola bar (oats/rice krispies perhaps?). I like their innovative idea of using something different than graham crackers for the base of a cheesecake.

The Lemon Meringue Tart was original, made with lemon filling with lightly torched cream on top. The taste was very similar to others I have had before. I also find the pie crust a little too thick and it dries out your mouth with every bite. Lemon zest could be added to the filling for more texture and freshness.

I was disappointed with the Lime Matcha Pistachio Slab. The lime flavour overpower both the matcha and pistachio. Even though, matcha has a strong and distinct flavour, I can only taste a little bit of it. The taste of pistachio was very minimal to none. I think the cake would be better if lime was taken out, as the two ingredients, matcha and pistachio, compliment each other very well. This cake was more sponge like out of the three.

I was excited to try their macaroons. I had them sitting on my table for 10 minutes and I noticed that they started to melt. Some of the food colouring actually melted off and stained my table. I'm pretty sure it was because the fridge at Delysees was at a much lower temperature, so their pastries cannot be left sitting in room temperature for long. The same thing actually happened to my colleague's mini cake. She got the cake that was topped with a macaroon. She said after 20 mins or so, the cake started to melt and the macaroon fell off with the coating of the cake.

Anyhow, I had the navy blue macaroon with shiny flakes on it. I guess it belongs to one of their champagne collections. The macaroon was very sweet. It was so sweet that I couldn't taste any other flavour. You can probably only have one or two macaroons at most in one sitting because of the sweetness.

The service at Delysees was okay. The girl who was serving us looked pissed off the whole time, but she did eveything else to serve us. For example, choosing her favourite macaroons for us because we didn't know which ones are good. 

The store was clean and considering they are a bakery, the store was very spacious. They even have several tables for customers to hangout and enjoy their coffee.",2017-02-15 05:23:50

I asked which tacos he suggested for me, street, fish, or Tacos al Carbon. He suggested the Tacos al Carbon at $13.99. He said the meat used was fajita meat. We also had Nachos Supremo ($11.99). My tacos al carbon had nice tender meat, and nice tortillas, nice pico de gallo, lots of iceberg shredded lettuce, lots of shredded cheese. The meat was tender, but way too salty for me. I ate one and had had enough. I ate another as the dish was so pricey and I hated to waste it. I could not eat the last. Overall, this dish was overpriced and lacking in quality. The Nachos Supremo were a generous portion and good (not too salty)... ground beef, pickled jalapeno slices, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, chips. 

We finished with a fried ice cream with chocolate sauce. I liked the cinnamon chip in it best. The ice cream was frozen very hard and there was no warmth to the outside coating (I think it was prepared earlier and refrozen). The outside coating was unpleasantly chewy (rather than crisp) and reminiscent of soggy corn flakes. I think Arriba would do better to prepare this item fresh.

The only item I would get again would be the nachos (but I would only go here if someone else with me really, really, really wanted to go). I mentioned to the manager that I thought the pozole and the tacos al carbon were overly salty. She said she would check into it. The waiter later mentioned that we had a discount (it looked to be 20%, which was a nice surprise). 

I think many Mexican places have too much salt in their foods. I love pozole and tacos, but without so much salt. They taste fresher to me without all the salt. Most Americans get too much salt in their diets. Maybe this was an anomaly. I hope Arriba considers lowering salt content overall and using more fresh herbs, vegetables, and spices (likely more costly than salt). I also would like to see less shredded cheese and iceberg lettuce and more interesting lettuces...and maybe smaller amounts of more interesting cheeses. 

The waiter kept my water glass full which kept me satisfied. He seemed to allow us a leisurely pace and did not rush us. My companion felt he'd forgotten us a bit. He was gone for long periods (perhaps he had a large table area or had side work to do). Overall, service was decent and friendly.

On the way out, I noticed beer brewing vats. I was told Arriba brews their own beer. That sounds interesting.

Hmm...on the way in, the staff at the counter ignored us for a bit, occupied with their thoughts or tasks, perhaps. It would have been nice to have a greeting, followed by something like, ""I'll be with you in a moment.""",2014-05-31 23:45:43

The food overall was average if not a little overpriced. The restaurant has overall very hip feel and their menu has some nice health conscious choices too which I did like.

Free range chicken power grain ""salad""- basically a salad of lentils and quinoa mixed with some nuts and berries. I liked this a lot. It was very filling and more healthy however the dish lacked seasoning. Maybe using a little citrus vinaigrette could have brighten the dish a lot. The chicken also was basically a plain grilled breast which also had no flavor. Adding a seasoning rub wouldn't hurt.

Cubano sandwich- this was a nice sandwich. The bread was soft however the filling was a little sparse. Claims that the dish came with ""French fries"" but these were basically potato chips. They were nice and very crispy, but not French fries.

Bread pudding- this was a decent dessert. Very thick and rich. I love the sauce which had a hint of alcohol in it. Very comforting. 

(I will rant about the Service- normally I don't comment on service, but this was the worst service I've had in a very long time. We were seated and 10 mins passed before anyone came to the table to even offer us drinks. This was at 2pm- so not during a rush lunch hour. Supposedly our waiter was backed up so the manager had to come and take our orders. Then after we placed our orders, another 5 mins passed where we never got our water cups filled and we didn't get any of the starter bread crisps that were on everyone else's table. I had to flag a random bus boy down to give us some water. Then after another 10mins a different worker came and gave us our entrees and just left without letting us ask for refills. No one gave us utensils so we sat there for several more mins before I could flag someone down for utensils. Just horrible.)",2013-12-11 19:55:23

The pho soup is great, and although the spring rolls are just a little lacking in flavor, they also are very good.

Three times we went at hours that were not busy, and all three times the two of us were sandwiched between loud and obnoxious groups who had zero bowling etiquette.To the right of us was easily 15-20 empty lanes.

Ok, on to the food. This was the first time I have been to Capt Bills and did not have any idea of what to expect. I did check out the reviews on Yelp and they looked pretty good. I have driving by this place for years  and never stopped in so I figured why not. 
   When I first walked in I liked the look of the place. Lots of wood and it felt like an old school joint. I walked up to order and was greeted by a rather attractive young lady and thats always a good way to start things. I ordered the 10 inch Italian and 2 10 inch pastrami subs. Price was not to bad overall. The Italian sub is dirt damn cheap for what you get. I did order to go so I picked it up and went on home to try out this new (to me) place. 
   I took a bite of the Italian first and was amazed at how good it was. Lots of flavor with a nice fresh taste. Excellent bread with good cheese. This is a winner in my book. I will be back for the Italian. 
    I then reached over and took a bite of the pastrami and again was shocked at how good it was. This is not the type of pastrami you find at places like Chompies but a bit more like lunch meat. It was however very good with no gristle at all. Great flavor and very good cheese. Another winner for me. I am now starting to think about trying more and more of what Capt Bills has to offer.

As a first time visit, my experience was OK, but not mind-blowing. Good enough for me to want to come back.

-not nearly enough wide noodles
-odd addition of red bell peppers, but still tasty
-veggies nicely cooked through without being limp
-awesome flavor

Yellow Curry:
-OK flavor, coconut milk seemed like it may have gone bad
-potatoes not cooked all the way through
-one small serving of rice, did not have enough to get through the dish

Am I disappointed in your lame attempt at a return, very much yes. The best way to say is like this, if you never experienced the old WnW, you'll love and appreciate this attempt of a water park. It has a nice handful of fun rides, a big wave pool, and a decent lazy river. If you experienced and grew up on the old WnW like myself, you'll be very let down, however have hopes for what's to come. (Expansion expected) 2 feet less deep in the wave pool (5'10"" compared to 8) smaller lazy river, smaller derastuka (which is now called canyon cliffs) and HORRIBLE FOOD OPTIONS! Honestly had the food been better I may have bumped them up a star. Not only was it disgusting and overpriced, IT WAS YOUR ONLY OPTION!!! Burger, hotdog, pizza, or chicken fingers. I bet you're thinking, ""oh I better pack a cooler"" we'll think again! No outside food allowed!!! What?!?! We can't bring sandwiches and Gatorade? What the F$&! Wet n Wild?!? Biggest mistake yet! I truly hope that rule gets changed ASAP! It makes no sense to not offer more food if we can't bring it! I read a few people excited about Dippn' Dots. Well don't be! They were closed for all but 1 hour of the day. 
I'd say this place is ideal for ages 8-15. But still it isn't an all day event like it use to be. We could have knocked it all out within 4 hours. I most liked the rattler ride. It's a big tube that seats a group, goes up walls, and shoots you out fast at unknown directions. However I will bring up the massive unorganized staff. We rode this ride 3 times in a group of 5, before we were told by a lifeguard that it only seats 4. Another group in our large party of 12, went down with 6 people and were never stopped. There were a lot of groups experiencing this same issue. Walk all the way up stairs to find out you've been doing it wrong the whole time, who's taking the walk of heat back down?! The Zip, Zap, Zoom was wack. Wait in a super long line for a basic tube ride that's over in 20 seconds. If you spend the time in line, wait for the Zoom (green tube) it's the fastest. The half pipe ride looked cool, wouldn't know it was broken. The employees had no answers to any ?s. Like why rides were broken or shut down, or why it took 5 minutes for a medic when someone faints. The staff is literally a bunch of untrained 16 year olds probably working their first job. One question took calling 8 supervisors before we received an answer. 
Another negative was the lack of rental tubes. If you rent tubes you can use them for the rides. If you don't rent tubes you can steal them from someone like our party who had 10. Literally 2 people took off with 2 of our double tubes and no one did anything. I also had to stop many kids, and older siblings from plotting to steal our tubes! We literally hid and watched them try to take them. One person asked, then got an attitude when we wouldn't let her have a tube. We are not the rental station, nor was it our fault they sold out. If they had enough employees, tubes, food, drinks, ice cream, oh and water, we wouldn't have a 2 star review. But lack of everything?!? If you had the 50 million it took to build this place, you should have made sure you budgeted out running the place too. At least next year we have cowabunga bay.

A good ramen has good noodles, but also the broth has to have depth. By the way, depth does not mean oil. Depth means richness from hours of crafting a deep taste based on the flavour of the soup be it miso or shio or whatever. Kinton is now serving watery oil broth.
Guys, I know you don't actually hire ramen chefs, but at least train your cooks a little.

The other thing that Kinton used to do well was the atmosphere and greetings and that has been watered down too. They still welcome you apparently, but on a select basis. We were not welcomed in the old fashion, but another person who entered after us was. Even that welcome was half as exciting as before.

I'm giving it 5 stars not because it's a 5 star restaurant, of course, but because for what Olive Garden is, this one is excellent. My husband and I have been to this location 4-5 times, and every visit has been a good experience, but what prompted me to write a Yelp review this particular time was because of the great service from our server, Bouchra. 

Right from the beginning she was very friendly and polite. From the moment she arrived at our table she saw that we were already ready to order, (we get the same thing every time,) so she took our drink order and food order together. The reason I make note of this is because a lot of times servers will see that you're ready to order, but only take your drink order to buy themselves more time to catch up with something else. So I appreciate that she took the food order right away.

As we were waiting for our food she brought out our salad and breadsticks. We had the salad and breadsticks at our table for maybe 5-8 mins and she stopped by to bring us more breadsticks that were fresh out of the oven. This earned major points with us because who doesn't hate waiting and waiting for their server to come back, and then having to flag them down just to ask for more breadsticks. (Now I do want to mention that at our other visits to this location, the servers have all been very generous with the breadsticks. Everybody goes to Olive Garden for the salad and breadsticks, so I'm glad they acknowledge that and don't try to be stingy!) Anyway, after she dropped off the breadsticks she stopped by our table about 4-5 mins later and asked if we'd like more salad. We told her yes, and she was attentive enough to notice that we hadn't eaten the onions or olives and asked if we'd like her to leave them off. We said yes, and she told us to always ask if we want something left off the salad since they make them fresh for each table, and to let her know if we wanted something extra on the salad. I thought that was very nice of her. 

A few minutes later she brought out our food, and offered to refill our breadsticks again, which we said yes to. She popped by about 5-7 mins later to make sure everything tasted alright, and to make sure there wasn't anything else we wanted or needed. 

Bouchra was a super attentive server who definitely went above and beyond any service we've had at Olive Garden, or any other restaurant for that matter. She was very sweet and friendly and joked with us, but was still very professional. She was an excellent server and we will definitely return to this location specifically because of her wonderful service, making this an overall great experience.",2016-05-23 00:01:48

Thai Rama is a pretty casual joint - it seems like it used to be a Sizzler or something else in a previous incarnation. But the food is pretty good, and when I told them to make my dish spicy they actually listened and complied, so they get props for that. Good-sized portions as well, so you're getting your money's worth. The atmosphere may not be as nice as some other That restaurants, but the place is still clean and in the end, it's all about the food, right? It also seems like a popular place for local folks to order their food to go.

Food was great-
 we selected a few things from the menu that were vegan friendly and WOW. The mushroom burger was so juicy and had so much flavor, it probably was the juiciest burger I have has since becoming vegan. I personally wish there was less bun- but honestly that is just my preference. Maybe I will ask if having everything in a lettuce wrap is an option. FRIED PICKLES WERE AMAZING, I have been on this fried pickle kick- these were the tastiest most perfectly fried pickles I have had in a while. Tater tots were great, had this sweet taste to it but overall was really good. 

Service was good-
The young lady who was serving us was very nice, and also the cook- greeted us as we walked through the door! I'm assuming he was the owner, you can tell he really wants his clients to be comfortable and feel welcomed. I appreciated that


Location- 
If you are like me, if the food is great- I really don't care where it is or how it looks inside. However, if you are someone who cares about the ambiance and décor you may not be as comfortable with the Burger Joint. Take in mind they haven't been open very long, and it doesn't have a restaurant like décor. Plain tables, and no real theme. I didn't mind because the food and service made up for that aspect.

Overall it was a great try, because I live so far I probably would not drive back out to that side of town just for Burger Joint- but if I was in the area then YES I would definitely head here. Vegan/ Vegetarian options that taste delicious, a more down to earth approach, and good service.

The location is a 30+ minute drive from my house and it took Earl Grey to inspire my first trip to try out their ice cream. I was surprised to find that it was a sorbet, so I paired it with vanilla bean to add that creamy base. They incorporate a ton of quality vanilla beans in that one, making it great on its own and even better with the citrusy iced tea flavor of the Earl Grey sorbetto. Best of all, both flavors had that soft, fresh-churned texture that I love so much, like eating gelato straight from the machine. If it's already hard frozen, I prefer it as an affogato. I've never been a sriracha fan, but their sriracha gelato was not bad, either.

Well it must be all the employees friends and family eating here and writing reviews because the rating does not match the quality of food not the level of customer service we witnessed today. 

First, the food did not seem fresh at all. Everything that came to the table had very little flavour. The tempura shrimp was all tempura and no shrimp. It was also very oily. The texture of the rice was horrible. Let's just say this was the worst sushi we have ever had. We did not even finish the items we ordered because it was so bad. Second, one server kept refilling our cups with watered down green tea every second. We realized they use this trick to fill us up on liquid so we don't eat as much food from the AYCE menu. 

On top of it all, we showed the server the 10% off our bill offer from the Yelp app once we checked in. The server said we could only claim the offer if we paid cash. One out of the 3 of us had cash but the server was adamant about giving us the discount only if all 3 of us paid cash. Since my other 2 friends were paying by card none of us were able to claim the discount as per the server. I have never heard of this ""rule"". Additionally, because I showed the server the discount on my phone, without my permission she pushed the ""claim now"" buttons on my phone screen as if we had already claimed the discount. So even though she came back to the table and said we can't use the discount she already claimed it on my phone so we would not be able to return and try to claim the discount again.

They also have displays of bottles for certain occasions (anniversary, date night, break-up, make-up, etc.).  The staff is very friendly and helpful in finding you a great wine.

The best part of it all is that you can get a wine tasting card for $1, then add money to it to taste the wines they sell there.  For $1-3, you can get a one-ounce taste of at least most of the wines there.  And the wines themselves are very reasonably priced; the guy working there stated that they guaranteed the lowest prices on those bottles of wine in the state.

Our meal took a little while to arrive, which seemed odd, given that we were having a late lunch and there were only a few other customers.  Once it did appear, however, it was satisfying. I ordered the salmon tacos, which were on special, and I demolished them in short order. Even more delicious was the jalapeno cheddar grits casserole. It was more like just grits than a casserole, but it was amazing. Thinking about it is making me crave another serving.

I hereby endorse Krazy Fish with 4 whole Yelp stars. It's good to know there's a relatively convenient place to get my fish taco fix. No more going to NoDa just to get 'tude from the Cabo staff.",2012-06-05 00:33:09

While a generally responsible person, I recently dropped my rings in a pool and realized (after my sister found them) that I really needed an updated appraisal to ensure that if I actually had lost the rings, my insurance would pay out the full value. Why does it always take a scare to get me to do the responsible thing? Sigh. 

I called earlier on a weekday to get more information and the woman who answered was incredibly helpful. I said I was interested in an appraisal and she promptly let me know the hours the appraiser was available and how much it would cost. Given that you often have to fish for information, I highly appreciated how upfront she was. 

I ended up going into the store on a Saturday around noon and was immediately greeted by a very friendly couple, who owned the store. The woman immediately noticed how dirty my rings were and asked if she could clean them - I loved how willing she was to help before even knowing if I was going to buy something. 

The owner got me started right away by making copies of my existing diamond certificate and previous appraisal (helpful hint: make sure to bring any similar paperwork you have). Then, the appraiser came out and let me know that he could take care of the appraisal in 45 minutes. I decided to go shopping at Old Navy and come back. 

When I got back, the appraiser was done, as promised. (Score another one for honesty!). He walked me through all of his paperwork in detail and then sent me on my way with a smile. 

What a great local shop run by genuine and skilled people! I would definitely not hesitate to come back for my future jewelry needs and I highly recommend Burland to others looking to get an appraisal.",2012-07-09 03:29:10

The atmosphere was fun and casual- I really liked the view of the outdoor section where diners sit separated from the sidewalks of Tivoli Village by an attractively scalloped, metal ""fence.""  Aluminum-colored heating elements spaced throughout the outdoor area looked sculptural and artsy.  Large umbrellas protected patrons from the bright, hot sun.  Our waiter, Brian, had a great personality and made the experience even more enjoyable..

I had the risotto with chicken and the tossed salad for about $14.00. It was tasty, but I liked my friend's shrimp version better.  The crusty bread served before the meal was quite enjoyable.  A couple of us had the wedge salad, which was accompanied by a gorgonzola and garlic dressing that, in my opinion, was light and not overpowering. My friends loved that it had bacon.

The dishes and wine are well paired, food this caliber is served at  restaurants that cost twice as much...the ingredients are fresh and the plating is very appealing. Did i mention it was tasty too? yep very tasty.

I remember very good ravioli with mushrooms, the entrées are very good. The ingredients are very fresh... all around it is exceptional.

2. Seating - Hella lot more room at this place and therefore, they are able to handle many more people, size of parties.  This is an added plus.

I am, in a way, glad he asked the chef rather than giving out wrong information....but you should be familiar with your menu if you're going to work at a restaurant in a high-end hotel. 

I had the Farm House salad which was pretty good. It had mixed greens, kale, asparagus, green beans, edamame, cauliflower, and heirloom tomatoes.

Yardbird has a lofty reputation and as a result, our expectations were high.  Yardbird lived up to its considerable hype.  We had lunch at Yardbird on a Friday afternoon.  There were 3 of us and we were able to walk right in.  I liked the joint, especially the random pictures of Cash, Elvis, Bob Dylan, etc. that were cycling through on the wall.

We were approached fairly quickly by a server to take our drink orders.  Good beer list, decent wine list.  It was a little early for me so I went with a housemade lemonade.  As expected, a restaurant that specializes in southern fare makes fantastic lemonade.  It's $6 a glass, and I do not know if that comes with refills since I did not get one.  If you don't get refills that's a hefty price for lemon juice, water, and sugar, even when the mixture is as good as this.  

The 3 of us split the chicken and waffles, chicken biscuits, fries, mac and cheese, and coleslaw.  You may bristle at $36 for the famous chicken, watermelon, and waffles, but it was a lot of food.  You get 4 pieces of chicken plus a large serving of watermelon and the thick waffle.  The food comes out QUICK.  As in, within 5 minutes of us ordering it.  I guess when you have something as labor intensive as fried chicken as the star of the show you just constantly make batches of it.  But, it did not suffer in quality.  This chicken was definitely fresh, it had not been sitting under a salamander prior to its arrival at our table.

I had the breast and thigh of the chicken.  Both were juicy and flavorful, but the dark meat was better.  The skin is crunchy and seasoned very well.  No need for additional salt and pepper.  The chicken is just good quality fried chicken.  Is it the best I've ever had?  Probably not, but it is damn good and I didn't have any qualms about the price.

The waffle has a nice slight crunch to it and a chewy center.  Paired with the bourbon maple syrup it was very good.  Paired with the chicken it was great.  We had to ask for more syrup, the waffle to syrup ratio was off due to the size of the waffle.  The spiced watermelon didn't land with any of us.  It was okay, and it's good quality watermelon.  We just did not love it.

The sides, in order of preference:  mac and cheese, fries (with bacon ranch that they should bottle and sell), and cole slaw.  The slaw was good, its served with a crisp of chicken skin, but it couldn't compare to the mac and cheese.  This stuff was creamy and incredibly flavorful.  We all loved it.

The chicken biscuits were another winner.  The flavorful chicken on a flaky biscuit with some very good pepper jelly was a strong combination.

The wonton soup has a cool presentation but is not practical for getting every last drop of soup because the ladle is unable to scoop the soup and cabbage from the bottom. The soup was tasty with a few spice variations from the typical version which added freshness. The basil rolls were okay but not what we expected as they were pretty much just filled with thin noodles and not many vegetables as we expected.

I actually thought this was a two location local chain.  I must be the only person who had never heard of or seen an Original Pancake House before.  Anyway, I was wanting some kind of elaborate pancakes and fresh juice, and they hit the mark for both!  There were a lot of other contenders that came up, but most of them either weren't open early enough or seemed like they wouldn't be so child-friendly.

The 6-egg omelettes are enormous, and come with 3 pancakes, which you can upgrade to any of their specialties for an extra charge.  I got the blueberry, coconut, white chocolate chip ones (forget the name), and they were excellent.  I will be searching for other coconut pancake options in the future.  My husband had the chocolate peanut butter chip ones, and was somewhat sickened by the overwhelming sweetness (powdered sugar, whipped cream, and syrup on top of those chips.  yikes!).

Every single piece of food on the menu is good. Some are better than others, obviously, but everything is solid and you will not be unhappy no matter what you order.

The waitress told us the Parmesan sauce is the best one for the meatnballs, so I ordered that. She was right, it is FANTASTIC! You get 3 decent sized meatballs for $7. Couple that with a $5-6 side dish, and it is just the right amount of food.

They have a milkshake menu that is slightly overpriced at $6 a piece, but they have fun varieties and a ton to choose from, so if you're a milkshake person, you will enjoy it.

The pizzas are HUGE and actually a very good deal, for the size you are getting. The pizza is also FANTASTIC. Easily in the top 3 I have had in Vegas thus far. 

We were a party of 10. They told us they would seat us within 30 minutes. They seated us within 30 minutes. The servers were fast, efficient, and got every single one of our orders right. 

My ONLY pet peeve about this place...we spent $250 on food and drinks and when we told the waitress we had a birthday girl in the party, they refused to bring her a dessert and sing for her! We were told by the waitress that ""We don't do free birthday dessert. Do you want to buy one?"" WHAT?? We spent $250 and they couldn't give us a $7 dessert? That's just cheap and bad customer service. And definitely NOT the way to get a loyal fan base when you are a brand new restaurant.

But, other than that EXTREMELY vexing point, our experience here was a great time and we loved everything about The Meatball Spot. For a place with a name that does not sounds very good, it was delicious!",2012-11-20 03:27:26

The complimentary bread and oil/vinegar dip was very good, crusty on the outside while warm and soft on the inside. We got the smoked salmon bruschetta and the bacon cheese burger off the happy hour menu.  The salmon tasted like it was food quality and freshly smoked, however it was very salty. The olives were  even saltier. Towards the end of the platter, even sharing between two people, the dish was hard to enjoy. We even started picking off the olives and eating a lot of the garnish greens on the plate to help.

The burger looked great, served on ciabatta bread with the perfect amount and slice thickness of tomato and onion.  The only complaint I had was that my medium burger was a bit extra charred on parts of the outside and the bread was burned in one corner.  So about a quarter of the burger tasted like a brick of coal.

We ordered tiramisu for dessert. It was actually pretty good and well portioned.  Of course it was $7 so it ought to be!

All in all, i'm not sure I'd be too excited about going back. I might go one more time to try a pasta dish, maybe that's their specialty?

So all the time we were waiting and could have easily fit in many seats they were waiting for the only two tables in the joint for us to sit at.  Absolutely rediculous.  

Our waitress was actually wonderful once we were permitted access to the restaurant.  Unfortunately the food was just mediocre once again.  Not sure why people line up for this place.  Just goes to show there is absolutely nowhere worth eating breakfast at in about a 15 mile radius of The Place.

I can't imagine people waiting in line here as some reviewers have mentioned. Seriously? Wait in line? Anyways. My buddy gave it a 4 star. His review is around here somewhere. And it does remind me of the Deli's in New York. Well actually, it reminds me of Deli's in a lot of cities. This restaurant is quite large, lots of tables and booths. Also, a large patio. Plenty of seating. Our hostess was pleasant enough. Sat us in a booth, told us who are server would be and headed back to the check-in stand.
Our server was fine. He did fail to mention anything about ""All you can eat Fish & Chips"" on Fridays though. And it was Friday. Hmm. Well, to be fair, he didn't really mention anything other than the standard ""what can I get you to drink?"" We got our drinks and ordered our lunch.
My friend S ordered a Signature sandwich; Times Square New Yorker with Pastrami. $15.99. This sandwich, as shown in the pic is NOT worth near 16 bucks. MAYBE $12.99. And that's being generous. His comment when we were leaving was ""Definitely not worth the price"". Hmmm, yet he still gave it a 4 star.
I ordered a Signature sandwich as well, Wendy's Favorite. $14.99. Now, as you can see in the pic, there was A LOT of Turkey. Over 13 oz. (I weighed the half I took home, 6.6 oz.) Since as you can see it's kind of impossible to eat as it's served, I took one roll of Turkey off and put that in a to-go box. I took the other roll of Turkey and cut it in half and put the sandwich back together with that. Well, I also added the lettuce, red onion rings and tomato from C's Cheeseburger plate which turned it into a nice sandwich. The bread I will say was sad. Falling apart, flattened. Definately nothing special. And what's with the potato salad being served in a little cup? I'm dining IN. Put the salad ON the plate. Oh, and the potato salad. Hard potato pieces, not a whole lot of flavor. Unimpressed. 
As I mentioned, C ordered the Checkered Cab Cheeseburger with Sweet Potato Fries. $8.48. Again, not worth the price. The patty was smaller than the bun which was nothing special, kind of a flattened sesame seed bun. Plus, the kids meal does NOT include a drink. So, add an additional $1.99 for a child's drink and you have $10.47 for a kids meal. How do people with kids afford this place? I didn't realize until after we left that his meal was supposed to come with a Sprinkle Cookie. It didn't. The $2 bump in price for his meal was for the Sweet Potato Fries. They were good and a decent portion. Not sure if they're worth the $2 price bump though.
The total bill for the 3 of us with 20% tip was $59.41. That's almost $20 each. The list of restaurants that C and I could go to for $40 bucks and have a great lunch or dinner is HUGE. Chompies is NOT on that list. 
I love the disclaimer on the Gluten Free menu that states because of the possibility of cross contamination, Chompie's can't guarantee that the Gluten Free friendly items are 100% Gluten Free. So what's the point? I guess ""Gluten Free"" sounds better than ""Maybe Gluten Free"". Do people with a Gluten sensitivity mind playing Russian roulette with that? I assume it's not as critical as a nut or shellfish allergy 'cause that would not be good.

The texture had a nice bite to it, but not too al dente.  I had their beef noodle soup and my husband had their vegetable and beef fried noodles (lo mein).  Both were very good.  Best noodles I have had in AZ, hands down.  They only make one kind of noodle, but you can choose from a variety of shapes.  

A warning however to those who have an aversion to certain meat sinew.  The beef that came in the my beef noodle soup came from, I believe, some cut of rib, straight off the bone.  So, although the beef was nice an tender, there were some pieces of sinew that were attached to most of my pieces of meat.  They were mostly tender, but some were a bit chewy.  Some people, like myself, actually enjoy eating these pieces of meat, but for those of you who don't, you might want to order a different kind of noodle soup.    

We also ordered the pork steamed dumplings and the beef stick.I was not a big fan of the beef stick.  I think the cut of beef they use for the beef stick is not ideal for that type of treatment.  It was overdone, tough, and I wasn't too into the sauce.  I can't quite describe it except that it was a light soy sauce marinade, on the slightly sweet side, with little to no depth.  

The steam dumplings were okay.  The dumpling skin is not typical; thin and delicate.  Simply based on the skin, they were very ""hearty"" dumplings.  I think they may use the same or similar dough recipe for their dumpling skins as with their noodles.  The filling was okay.  A bit on the mushy side for me and the sauce that they serve with it is lighter in terms of sweetness than most sweet and sour sauces.  

The staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable.

It had a very casual atmosphere and it was decorative, the Mexican food section had a Mexican theme decor, the Chinese food section had a Chinese theme decor, and so on. It had character. I liked the layout. One big section in the middle for desserts. Matching fruits, salad, and soup sections on each side of the buffet. And a row of everything else stretching across the entire length of the buffet starting. Most of the food wasn't the greatest but their BBQ section had to be one my favorites.

This new buffet is a lot brighter and a lot ""fancier"" looking than before. The layout is just one long row stretched across the length of the buffet. They have the usual Asian, Italian, BBQ, and Mexican sections with various items changed and even improved. The dessert section is a lot smaller but offered some better items. The soups, salads, and fruits section is ok. There's grilled steak. There's these thick short ribs which was my favorite item. I ate a bunch of them. The BBQ section seemed smaller but they still had the BBQ beef ribs which was good. They have crepes, pho, el pastor tacos, and those Mexican corn on the cob.

I didn't realize how small this place was, so I am very happy we were able to grab a table. We both ordered the Sweet Home Alabama. She ordered hers sans bacon because she keeps kosher.

It's a swanky joint with some very high end games, complete with a smoking platform just outside their 2nd story over looking the Fremont experience.   Their restrooms (The reason I went inside) were spic and span, and quite well appointed.

In the main room, the poker games have dance tables between them, and on each platform is a scantily clad girl in a bra and panty set. As I walked through, the music queued up, something by Rhianna, and the girls all began to do a dance number. Granted, it wasn't a hard number, and they weren't all in synch, but it wasn't terrible and they provided some necessary distraction, I'm certain.

-Two Eggs any way w/ hash browns, toast add meat for extra $.
-Chicken Fried Steak
- Three Eggs with peppers, onion, potatoes, and cheese had the appearance of a skillet with no skillet.

I went for two eggs over, wheat, and bacon.  Hard to mess this dish up.  My food came out of the kitchen pretty fast since I was the only cover at the time, so that should be expected.

I always like to try out a new restaurant in whatever casino I'm seeing a concert in (or in the case of the Cosmo I include Aria's options).   Since I splurged a little with Julian Serrano a few weeks back, I thought we should take it easier on our bank accounts with Holsteins.  This wasn't seen as a downgrade in my eyes too much because I'd been wanting to try their Gold Standard Burger ever since I'd read John Curtas praise it as (one of?) the best in Las Vegas.

Given the fact that one of their signature milkshakes would probably cause me death due to my lactose intolerance (and not a quick, lethal injection/firing squad death which might make it worth it, but more of a slow, chinese water torture/buried alive death) I passed on those, though they sure sounded delicious.  I instead opted for my usual Jack and Coke which was an acceptable version, but not as strong as I normally prefer.

For food we skipped appetizers because the majority seemed fried or slathered with cheese and or some sort of ranch dressing (I know, it's a burger joint) and I just didn't feel like I needed any of that before I gorged on a giant burger and fries along with the whole slow death sentence thing.  I ordered the Gold Standard with no altering of the standard fixings cooked medium, and shoestring fries on the side.

Shortly thereafter the burger arrived and looked delectable and consisted of a Dry Aged Sirloin patty, nice smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese (goat cheese tends to sit easier with my intolerance in case nosy minds were inquiring), tomato confit (I had to google confit to remind myself what it was.   I already forgot.  Roasted?), and arugula and some garlic aioli.   The burger was perfectly cooked, and I really enjoyed every bite of it.   I do think that there might have been too many flavors going on which took away from the quality of the beef.  I'm not sure it really needs the aioli or maybe it needs less, and the cheese tasted really nice, but I felt like it may have overpowered the whole thing a little.  I'm being very nitpicky as it was a tasty burger as Sam Jackson would say, but all in all I still prefer almost any I've had at Bachi or Fuku burger and they are more reasonably priced.   The fries were very average and had zero qualities worth mentioning here which was a bit of a disappointment.   Service was friendly and responsive for the entire meal, if not a little robotic seeming at times.  I can live with that for an $80 dinner and drinks for 2 at the casino where the table minimums are my monthly salary.",2012-08-24 22:37:08

There is a good variety of lunch options and breakfast is also available until 2.  One of the cooks offered samples of the tomato soup and the white bean soup.  Both had kind of a pulpy texture that I wasn't really into, and anyway I don't need hot soup when it's 110 degrees out.

I went with the tomato and fresh mozzarella pesto sandwich on ciabatta and it was great.  The ciabatta had the crunch that I love and was sliced thinly enough that I didn't feel like I was gnawing it off.  The sandwiches don't come with anything but you can get a side of potato salad or broccoli salad (maybe these selections change from day to day?) for $3.50 or purchase a bag of pretzels or potato chips.  I sampled the broccoli salad, which was tasty, but I knew the sandwich would be plenty of food for me.  The hibiscus raspberry iced tea (slightly sweetened) mixed with the unsweetened black tea was an excellent combination.  

I would not recommend coming here with a large group.  Or a small group.  Pairs and singles are best here, as most of the indoor tables only seat 2 people.  Alternating built-in bench seats and tables run along one of the walls, which could work for one person or two people who don't mind turning to the side to talk to each other.

With so many boba shops moving out of Spring Mountain and into the rest of Vegas, it was about time a boba shop made an appearance in Henderson. However, maybe this unfilled niche needs to stay unfilled. 
We ordered the Classic Taiwanese milk tea, almond milk tea and taro smoothie. The milk tea tasted like sugar water, with no hint of milk tea whatsoever. The almond milk tea was better because it didn't taste like only sugar water, but instead sugar water with a hint of almond. Unlike any taro drink I've had, the taro smoothie was not sweet at all and was colorless. When we asked why it didn't look like the purple drink they had posted pictures of, they offered to add food coloring to the drink..............  
GHOST BOBA?! What kind of bastardization of boba is that?! The sugar in boba is supposed to make it black.... So does the boba here not have sugar in it? Because I wouldn't be surprised. Have you ever tasted something that had more texture than taste? Well that's what the boba here tasted, or felt like? It had such a hard texture, and it CRUMBLED in my mouth. It wasn't chewy and there was absolutely no taste. Make like a ghost and disappear you ""ghost boba,"" you were so, so bad. Oh, also the boba so almost too big for the straws they had hahaha. It was a struggle to get those things through the straw at first, but after tasting them, I was glad it kept them out. 
With the shop being near so many colleges it would have been better to make it more study friendly. The tables were communal style with hard chairs and there weren't very many accessible outlets. They had a few comfy couches, but with only 2 areas it was filled with people the entire time we were there. Don't come here expecting to find a seat! I would suggest coming here for a quick chat rather than expecting to be able to study for hours. 
The kitchen is in the back, so no sounds of loud coffee blenders. Which I really, really appreciated!

I do wish they had some line control at the entrance though; you had a very long line out the door to order (to go?), and another side where people were exiting, and another of people trying to go in to find a table to sit at... it was a huge cluster---- around the doors!

But once you're inside it really opens up, the entire building is one giant organ - every instrument you see on the wall is used when a song is being played! It gets pretty loud in here, and I did find myself shouting a bit over the crowd noise, but overall I didn't find it annoying, just part of the fun :)

The pizza was SO good, crispy underside, yummy mozzarella cheese... I'm literally drooling thinking about this pizza again!! Unfortunately I didn't get the chance to try their ice cream, but next time for sure I will!

Anyway, I wouldn't say this spot is a secret - it gets super busy. And by super, I mean a 2 hour wait on a Wednesday night. Well, technically it was like an hour wait to even get seated. Once inside, I realized that this place is pretty small and cozy, so seating is limited. We chose to sit at the bar because spots opened up. We ordered 4 rolls to share amongst 5 people. Our server was friendly but it still took a long time for food to come.. almost an hour I'd say. It was interesting to see the talented and very speedy sushi chefs crank out rolls, but at the same time it was sad just wondering if they were finally making ours and watching the plates being whisked away. I think they felt bad that we were waiting so long, so they put 4 of our rolls onto a sushi boat without us asking. I think my favorite roll was the big boss roll (it's their most popular one), and the discovery roll was also good. All the rolls were unique and flavorful. I never really tend to opt for the more traditional options so I can't really speak to those. Their selection is quite expansive. 
Honestly, this place should expand to a bigger space - I think that's their main problem right now.

It was great that I was able to request no sugar and no ice for my drink. 
The bubble tea was quite tasty! The tapioca sizes were irregular - some very small so it made chewing on it feel quite weird. The milk tea itself was decent. 

However, I think I would definitely choose Chatime for their bubble tea. The milk tea has a more authentic taste and their tapioca sizes are chewy and tasty as well! It is also less pricey at Chatime too!

After seeing picture of Bent's Seafood Bent-O Box on twitter, Bent Restaurant (@BentRestaurant) suddenly moved right to the top of my to-eat list. On top of that, it was such a great deal at $35 for 2 before 7pm and $42 onward. I have been meaning to visit for ages since I am a big fan of Susur Lee (@susurlee) and he's behind the menu. This is definitely a family affair with the sons, Kai and Levi Bent-Lee reining the restaurant and Lee's wife behind the design of the space.

Love the casualness of the space with an array of vintage childhood toys on display.
Since the special will only be available until June 8th, the place was packed on this Friday night and we only manage to secure seats at the bar.


We were still in sake redrawal after the Kampai Sake event the day before, we didn't order sake as usual... so I had the Feature Cocktail instead which was a Mojito w/ Yuzu $15 while Ben had a Tsing Tao Beer $7.

I have to say that the price of their cocktails was rather steep but mine was a rather large glass but I notice that some other ones being served was rather small with price ranging from $14 to $18.

 Seafood Bent-O include the following :

Lime Coconut Curry Shrimp Soup 
~ tomato, corn, squash, crispy puff rice 
~ I was very surprise at how light and flavorful this was, normally coconut soup are just heavy and very one dimentional in taste. 
~ This one, you can taste every components and just pack so much flavor.

 Then the rest was served at once in a large Bento Box:

 Lobster Tacos
~ charred onion tomato salsa, chipotle, avocado, in taro shell (bottom centre)
We got one in taco shell and one in wonton shell, they should have stick with the taro as per the menu since it was a better texture and taste with the lobster fillings.

Pressed Octopus
~ lentil, tomato, black garlic, perilla, herbed olive oil, pomegranate vinaigrette
~ This was a very interesting dish with the octopus without much flavoring apart from it's own seweetness while the vinaigrette was rather salty but interested flavor that I believe come from the black garlic.

 Oyster Sake Shot
~ lemongrass, shallots, ponzu marinated salmon roe
~ I was king of surprise that we were not serve this before the soup since this was the first item on the menu but I sort of understand since the soup was served hot and had a stronger flavor compare to the dishes to come. So the tart vinegary liquid here act sort of like a cleanser.

  Tuna+Watermelon Ceviche
~ shaved red onion, cilantro, crispy shallots, fresh citrus juice, Rocoto chili, Chinese doughnut fritter
~ Love the thing slices of Chinese doughnut fritter on top, not only was it pretty but also a great crispy texture that's needed. 
~ This was a very interesting dish with all of the different flavor and texture like spicy chili, crispy fritters, fatty soft tuna and sweet cool refreshing watermelon.

Spicy Tuna Avocado Tartare
~ Love the crispy tuna served on top of a crispy rice cake.... it's like a deep fried sushi ;)
~ This was so good, I guess I can eat just the df rice cake all day. 

Spicy Peruvian Style Ceviche
~ white snapper, clams, mussels, calamari, Aji Amarillo chili, fresh lime juice

  Asian Style Atlantic Salmon Cravlax
~ Japanese omelette, horseradish lemon & chive creme fraiche, marinated salmon roe
~ This was probably the only thing that we didn't like from the bento box, really don't understand the choice of the soft dough-y pancake here which took over all the texture and taste of the salmon. 
~ Wish it was served on a lighter or slightly crispy base.

 Braised Spiced Short Ribs $22
~ black garlic, truffled parsnip puree, roasted rosemary duck fat potato
~ This was the only dish we order on top of the Bento Box and it was melt in you mouth goodness. 
~ The rib was braised so soft and flavorful and love how light the truffled was which didn't overpower the puree at all.
~  The sauce was thick and delicious, the Chinese in me was craving for a bowl of steam rice to go with it. And need I say more, it's duck fat potato... yummmmmm

 Dinner ends with complementary desserts w/ a Mango Panna Cotta topped with tapioca and a Strawberry Rhubarb & Lemon Curd Parfait. The Panna Cotta was more like the Chinese mango pudding you get at dim sum but packed with real mango flavor which I love and the sesame crisp on the side was to die for. And love the refreshing parfait to end the meal.

Verdict :
~ No one does Asian fusion cuisine better than Susur Lee
~ I really enjoy my meal here
~ Great Food, Great Value, Great Service, Great Atmosphere
~ The Ben-O Special last until June 8th, so only a few more days left.",2013-06-06 01:40:14

I ordered my steak frites medium but it came out practically raw. It was such a fatty piece of meat, I could barely cut it. I asked our waiter for two steak knives and he said, ""We're at an airport."" Well, that makes sense but there are more polite ways to respond, such as, ""Unfortunately, I can't give any steak knives because we're at the airport and sharp knives aren't allowed."" We told him the steak was not a very good cut and he just stared at us blankly.

My sister had the orange mocha latte with rice milk and OMG it's was delicious 10stars!! For food I had the tofurkey sandwich 4/5 stars, there's some ingredients that I could have gone with out. My sister had the nom nom burrito ""the eggs didn't taste like real eggs, the beans tasted like caned refried beans and it was cold, I was hoping it would be hot because there was eggs and potatoes in it. 2/5 stars."" Finally, we decided to share the hummus and pita chips 2/5 stars. The presentation was not there, the hummus was in a little to go container and the pita chips where in the bag. Very cute spot, very hipster. Although the food needs a little work the drinks where out of this world. Now Customer service is everything to me and this place definitely has it going on!!

I feel guilty giving anywhere else a five star rating after coming here, because it's in a league of its own. As an expert in fine dining, I can honestly say this is the best restaurant experience in America. Better than Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, and the famous French Laundry. Period. This chef deserves a James Beard Award more than anyone else. It should have multiple Michelin stars.

It's in the beautiful Wild Horse Pass hotel. The decor is modern with Native American influences. The windows allow you to watch the beautiful sunset while you dine. From a view perspective, it's impeccable! The wait staff is incredible. We had 10 different waiters, each of which were unbelievably knowledgeable regarding the menu. They intricately explained each course, the chef's inspiration, and the sourcing of ingredients. The staff bends over backwards to make you feel like royalty.

We did the 13 course tasting menu. They do have abnormal menu and a shorter tasting menu option (only 7 courses). But, I'd highly recommend the 13 courses, as it allows you to try nearly everything. It's called the journey, which is quite fitting.

The courses were as follows:

Foie gras amuse

Hahl soup with 32 hour brisket and prickly pear cotton candy - cotton candy melts as you eat it

Hand picked lettuces

The Preserved Garden

Foie gras and apple pie - The best foie gras I've ever had.

Elixir

Dusted hebi with tuna tartare and squid ink

Festival of seasons NY strip

Escargot

Coconut tamarind palate cleanser sorbet

Tenderloin of tribal buffalo

Cheese course

Deconstructed tiramisu.

Then, they bring local herbs in a wood bowl with rocks and dry ice. They pour tea over to and it smokes for a good 10 minutes, filling the entire room with a relaxing aroma. This was the absolute best culinary feat I've ever seen. More so than Grant Achatz's dessert balloons at Alinea. Epic, purely epic.

So, five hours later, we finished. As if the above experience weren't enough, the chef came out from the kitchen and greeted us. As we left, they put a thank you card, two Voss water bottles, and some homemade jelly in the car. All in all, the best restaurant in America. Well worth the price tag!!",2016-10-17 17:34:31

And they tend to be outrageously expensive. The exceptions are Sauce, which in my opinion serves insipid food, the Counter (it's 25 cent coffee was the deal of the decade) and the new Zinburger. 

    Of course, Zinburger is easy on the eyes, with it's huge mural of happy cows, and it's lighthearted use of chartreuse accents. Given that it's in the the Biltmore Fashion Park, 
$8-14 for various types of burgers isn't bad - and they're big enough to share. Sides of french fries, fried zucchini, etc. are $3-5, and salads range from $9-14. There are lots of milkshakes and floats at around $6. The trouble, as I see it, is that you can get better for  less bucks at Indulge or BluBurger (particularly if you use a coupon). DeLux is a little less expensive, with a lot more food options, although the ambience isn't as pleasant. I won't bore you with what we ate, suffice to say it was merely okay. 

    My favorite thing is the irony. Zinburger, with it's emphasis on meat, sits a few doors down from Sam Fox's Tru, which specializes in being vegetarian and vegan friendly.",2010-04-15 04:11:07

The service was attentive despite things taking a little longer than preferred to come out from the kitchen.

The menu was awesome! While we didn't order any specialty drinks, there was a diverse selection and they were reasonably priced. They even offered kombucha from Lenny Boy! I did splurge and ordered the cinnamon buns from the brunch menu for the table. Four large buns come out in a cast iron skillet and they are covered with an orange glaze. OMG, worth every single calorie! For my meal I ordered the Mediterranean bowl. I wasn't as thrilled with this as I had hoped to be, but part of that could just be me being picky because the food was perfectly fine. The bowl had quinoa, rice, hummus, and some greek flavored dips, so it was just a lot of mushy foods for my taste. However, the falafel that came on top were pretty much the most flavorful, moist, perfectly cooked falafel that I've ever had. So that was a major plus.

That shows the commitment that this office really tries to deliver their own patient's babies and not have the on call or hospitalist OB do it. 

Dr Deka saw me promptly at every single appt and was very warn and caring. She took the time each visit to make sure I left with no questions. 

The office staff is very well organized and kind. I never had to wait longer than ten minutes to go back for my appt. They run the office very efficiently! 

You will be in good hands! Dr Crum visited me in the hospital to check on me (since Dr Deka is ""always on maternity leave"") and she spent a good amount of time making sure I was ok and that my new baby was doing well too.

It was creamy and decadent with gooey chocolate sauce on the bottom. The depth of flavor was surprising! 

Other friends had the frozen grasshopper, the campfire s'mores, and the vegan maple pecan shake. Everyone was very satisfied, and the table favorite seemed to be the campfire s'mores. Hands down.

Even though we had just eaten lunch at Jaleo, we did order some fries and fried pickles to go with the shakes. Both were delicious, and after having lukewarm, squirmy fries at Gordon Ramsey PUB, these fries were a welcome change of pace!

I walked into Home Depot with tremendous worry about how to build a Hawaiian horseshoe set for my nephew Kili.  Since majority of our family is back on Hawaii, Kili could want nothing more than to be with them and to play his favorite horseshoe set.  My wife and I searched for hours on the internet, ebay, amazon, and more and there was nothing that came close to what we are used to playing.  His Father, was extremely saddened to break the news to Kili that it would be impossible for us to obtain what he truly desired and if we could substitute his horseshoe set with anything he wanted.  He was distraught, but had no choice.  I took it upon myself to give it the college try by heading over to Home Depot.  I immediately walked into the flooring department where I was greeted by Jay (Supervisor for flooring) and Jen (an ASM).  After I explained buy dilemma, they instantly walked over to the computer and started taking down specs and printing pictures from the internet.  I was disbelief and really had no idea what their intentions were.  Jay told me that it would be ready by tomorrow morning (Kili's party was at 2 p.m.).  Leaving a little skeptical and unsure what happened, I left thinking that there is no way this would truly work out.  

Jay called me first thing Saturday morning and told me it was ready.  I flew to the store curious and excited, however, a little doubtful.  Upon my arrival, the most immaculate and detailed set I have ever seen was there waiting.  The box was pristine, the carpet that covered the box was on superbly flush, and Jay even found that 2 1/2 inch washers that was not in their hardware department.  I was blown away!!!!!!!

Not only was the item perfect, but it was free of charge.  I must've hugged Jay several times and almost burst into tears.  She told me that Ken, A.W., and Chuck (ASM) were instrumental in creating the masterpiece. There are few times in life where you are absolutely dumbfounded by sheer kindness of such a selfless task.   I will forever be loyal to the Home Depot.  I never thought a trip to the hardware store could touch my family;s heart.  Kili had the best birthday ever and for the first time Las Vegas actually felt like Home.

I mean, I did get a decent meal and by all means recommend it if you can afford it. But for the amount of money I dropped on this meal - more than I've ever spent on any meal in my entire life - I expected nothing short of perfection. What I got was just...good.

To start, the service was weak and unprofessional. Our waitress did not approach our table until fifteen minutes after we were seated, and she didn't appear to be very talented at her job. That is, she could be a little too talkative at times and yet she made herself very difficult to find when she was needed. She by no means was the worst waitress I've had, but this clearly isn't your stereotypical ""snooty Frenchman waiting on you hand and foot"" experience. I would figure a place like this can afford to hire the cream of the crop in service staff.

And the food was really good! But it wasn't great. My main course (scallops) was alright, but not worth the triple cost I paid for them when compared against many seafood restaurants. Same goes for the pumpkin and squash dishes.

I really, truly enjoyed the (not French) onion soup and that has to be the most memorable experience for me at this restaurant. It takes a lot of talent to bring a soup up to that kind of silky consistency and it was so absolutely packed with flavor that I had to work at in very small sips. I also appreciated the chef constantly sending out amuse-boches to keep us happy between courses.

If there's a carpaccio plate on the menu when you choose to come here, don't pass it up. I don't think you could find anywhere else in town that could prepare the dish with such skill and originality. I ordered a paper-thin bison carpaccio with onion crisps and a salad on top that combined to make a flavor that was just out of this world.

Dessert? I don't even remember it. The one cocktail we bought was too overpowering to taste like much other than whiskey.

Overall, due to the restrictive cost this place is only for very special occasions. But for the price I'm paying I expect way more than a series of hit-or-misses and I'd be much better off spending this kind of money in a place like Chicago.

Love the good prices of the produce, but I know sometimes in the Bashas family, Food City doesn't have as nice of a selection in terms of quality as AJs or Bashas.  Most of the time, I use the stuff right away, so it's not a big deal.

I'll buy some of the thinly sliced beef steaks and sometimes the pork and chorizo.  Those are the meats I like to get there, but sometimes some stuff has too much fat and I'm better off paying more at a different store to get leaner stuff.  It sort of evens out because though I will pay more, I don't have to do the work of trimming all the fat off the meat.

I mainly buy a lot of fruit and veggies from Food City, which they have a good rotation on this and it is between my kids' school and home.  My kids love the wide assortment of palletas they have (frozen Mexican popsicles).

Their bakery is good, and we like the fresh tortillas and pork rinds, but we haven't been eating this type of stuff too much lately for health reasons.  I do not like their roasted green chilis, though.  I feel I'm better off roasting my own.

But, I always get great customer service here and I feel like they are a part of my family.

Above FOUR is Far Niente, which is another popular restaurant in Toronto's financial district.  Though the place is great for appetizers, and after work drinks, the service is slow, and it took close to 7 mins till someone came by our table to take our drink orders.  However after that the service was superb....perhaps someone in our party said something.  Long story short  
Their notable appetizers was their in-house HUMMUS.....perfect balance of flavours however they should have added more crostinis since there was still a lot of hummus left. 4/5
Calamari: not BREADED...but rather grilled, which was different, and a lot healthier, served with black bean sauce, orange vinaigrette and slaw..overall 3.5/5
Edamame: not too much salt...great, fresh, healthy 5/5..after all you can't really screw this dish up.
The Mains: 3/5  for the price and portion it was not worth it! $23 for 6 small slices served on a bed of grilled vegetables.  Though the presentation, spices, and herbs used brought out the versatility of the dish, I found it overpriced.  It's definitely not a wholesome meal.

I sat outside so can't comment much on the decor inside, though definitely a huge change from the La Paz days.

Service from hostess to server to busser to food runner was all very nice.  The bread is excellent, I think it was my favorite part of the meal!  It was so warm and fresh, a nice crustiness to it.  Its served with a sun dried tomato spread and I actually liked it, not being a huge SDT fan.

I got a salad and a pizza for lunch.  Here is where I am annoyed.  I asked is that too much food, the server assures me not at all.  Lie!!  The salad was entree size and I ate less than half.  Look I get that it pads his check, but I respect you more for your honesty and that's what makes me a repeat customer.  The salad wasn't great though, it was a chopped salad and it was drowned it dressing and some of the lettuce was sad and limp.  And not really chopped, I expected smaller pieces for a chopped salad, but that's me being nit picky I guess.

My entree was the vegetarian pizza.  I was excited for this.  And then I was pissed.  They covered it in red pepper flakes.  I didn't request this, it wasn't on the menu and I have 0 tolerance for spicy food.  So I sat there trying to pick the pieces out while my lips and mouth burned and I seethed.  I of course said nothing because it was already getting late and my hour for lunch was quickly ending so I just took it as a lesson learned, next time I will explicitly tell them to not add anything other than that which is stated on the menu!

I gave 3 stars because I am not ready to write them off yet.  They are convenient for me for lunch so I want them to succeed.  But maybe a little more time to get all the kinks worked out before I try again.",2013-05-17 18:20:17

I order the Downtown Breakfast Sandwich every time - I think the sandwich was personally designed for my taste buds, and I highly recommend it. My husband likes the Tower of French Toast, as it has different fruit varieties. They also have very inexpensive but heavily alcohol filled Mimomas.

We would never come to The Coffee Shop for anything other than breakfast because truthfully they offer standard sandwich and chicken tender type foods that we can find at home for a third the price, and there isn't anything memorable about the restaurant - it's very bare bones and diner-y.

Couldn't decide on what to eat so came here on a whim. Came on a Saturday night and most tables were filled. As soon as you walk you walk in, you're greeted by all the staff in Japanese. The decor is very similar to other Japanese ramen restaurants but with a more modern feel with bright red and white accents. The menu is quite simple, each ramen has basic toppings shown in the picture and you can choose to add toppings with extra costs of course. One flaw was that it wasn't quite clear what the basic toppings were for each ramen by just looking at the picture. I ordered the tonkotsu spicy miso ramen and my friend ordered the tan tan (the other spicy ramen). Apparently those were the two most popular ramens according to the waitress. The portion was decent even if it didn't seem like it since the bowl was quite deep. Both me and my friend agreed that the broths were too salty especially after mixing in the spicy dark coloured paste which was on the ramen. I would just remove the paste if possible since it just really made the broth way too salty for my liking. It wasn't spicy and the spicy ramen came with half an egg and decent amount of meat. However the other ramen didn't come with an egg. We were surprised the type of noodles were different for both ramens. The spicy miso ramen had thin noodles while the tan tan had thicker noodles. Personally, I preferred the thicker noodles. It would be nice if they had the option of allowing customers to choose the type of noodles beforehand. All in all, the ramen was average but if you're really craving ramen and you're in the area you can give it a try. On a side note, there was an outlet beside our table which I always appreciate because I always need to charge my phone haha.",2016-02-04 07:30:44

I have been to this Brio many times for the restaurant and not happy hour. Yesterday we came for happy hour at the bar because we've heard SOOO many good things about it. We heard that service was good, food was even better, and the drinks were worth it... I mean look at other reviews. I always HATE to be THAT person. SO it cringes me to write this review.

We come in and the bar booths are all full. The tables next to the bar are full. So we opt to go outside. There's one table open but kind of in an awkward spot so we decide to sit at the bar that's located outside. We were sitting there for about 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. We felt like... why isn't anyone coming to us? And there was a couple that had just finished to the right of us. So we knew we were allowed to sit there. Finally, a bar back (not a bartender) actually acknowledges us and gives us menus. Still from there, no bar tender. We decide to go back inside and find a spot inside of the bar. Finally two chairs but still no attention from anyone. We see at least three bar tenders catering to other people. At this point we're thinking ""are we invisible?"" Finally some guy (after about 20 minutes of being there) asks ""Can I see your IDs?"" checks them, and asks if he want something to drink. No hello. No how's it goin. Uh, okay. We order the our drinks and they come out. WE ask if we can order food. I don't know, does he not care that we're paying customers here? We ordered Beef Carpaccio and the new Nachos to start. While waiting for the food I had to get his attention to ask for lemons which took forever to get. I could see them right there, I felt like I could just grab them myself. The food came out. I liked the Beef Carpaccio but it was pretty salty. The nachos weren't nacho chips but potato chips (never seen that before). Interesting. We wanted to get the flatbread but then again it takes forever to get their attention to order something. Finally getting his attention, we ordered the pepperoni and sausage flat bread. Very dry. 

We had our receipt already because he kept printing out the tab every time we ordered something. Okay, that's good at least we didn't have to ask for the check. But paying took forever. My boyfriend had the payment out for quite a long time. No one acknowledge it and finally another person who wasn't catering to us came and grabbed it.

Overall, I was very disappointed with the service and quality of the food. The drinks were okay. And I definitely am shocked to have had a very different experience than all of my friends. I seem to always have bad experience at bars. I don't understand if it's because I look young or what. But that's how it feels most of the time. I promise I'd tip well if you'd treat me well.

They have a quite extensive menu and there are still dishes that I need to return there to try.  I have never been disappointed with anything here
The decor is attractive. There are separate rooms so a group can be seated in the rear room.  There is a small bar inside the front door adjacent to a dining area.",2013-07-26 07:40:51

Our server was very professional, there at the good time and made sure our water was replenished. We were thinking to order a pitcher of sangria, but he told us we would have more for our money by ordering a tall glass. Kudos for being honest! 

Speaking of the sangria, it was just great! I had a white sangria with lots of berries in it and it really was refreshing. 

I then had the Soppressata Flatbread (basically a pizza). 4/5. Good portion, interesting mix of spicy and sweet with the chili honey. I also tasted the Funghi Flatbread and it was has great. Usually not a fan of vegetarian pizzas but this one was tasteful.",2016-08-09 02:26:44

My trusted Yelp confidant, Greg F. informed me of this place and then I noticed my other yelp peeps who visited as well. This place is beyond doubt one of the best stops I have ever had in Vegas. Since it was 3pm securing a spot was easy. I was able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the short ride over. When you get to the Venetian you can walk through the casino towards the theater or if you are upstairs in the canal shoppes find your way down to the bottom floor. 

The front has a nice open look and there is a large bar with some lounge seating available with plenty of TVs at the bar. We weren't sure what to expect with the seating arrangement. We were taken to the back of the restaurant closer to the kitchen. Some of the tables are kind of tight. You will have to squeeze in between other people eating to get in your seat. That was probably the only negative thing about the seats but the seats were comfortable and the table had plenty of room. The lighting was nice, not too bright or dark but just right. Tyler our server came by right away and introduced himself and then shared the daily special and explained the brunch menu. Then we were given some complimentary champagne, which was very good. I informed the restaurant on OpenTable about our anniversary. It was a nice little surprise for the wifey. 

Just a warning: The food portions are ginormous and can easily be split. With that said, it was no holds barred and I dove into the deep end without my floaties. I knew there was no way we would finish everything but who cares, it's Vegas and going all in is the name of the game. I started with some maple bacon donuts and I was very impressed. The deviled eggs were something I have never been into but my wife insisted that I give them a try and I was glad I did. Tyler recommended the brunch special for $20, biscuits topped with a fried chicken breast, bacon, gravy, and eggs. It was beyond delicious. I wanted to slap myself because I thought it was all a dream and did not believe that this concoction of gravy, biscuits, and bacon could be so rich. I have tried similar platters at other run of the mill breakfast spots and never had the same euphoric feeling. I usually feel miserable after eating at those other spots. It was completely different here. It was like I never wanted it to end. 

My wife ordered the Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles ($36). I would have paid 2x that for that plate. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection. Tender, moist, and no dry part on the bird. The waffles are cheese infused and the watermelon had a sweet flavor to it. The food is densely packed with all the carbohydrates and calories you will need for a week. We even ordered a side of biscuits but those pretty much went to waste because we barely ate half of each of the plates. I even offered to share some appetizers with the guests around me because we had so much food. 

During our meal, Sandra one of the main chefs overheard we were Dodgers fans from the LA area and she offered to buy us dessert. We went the banana pudding. I thought it was going to be a bowl of banana pudding but it was a jar with sponge cake and vanilla wafers, with the pudding topped with baked shaved bananas. It was truly amazing. Thanks, Sandra for the wonderful dessert. I wanted to give a special shout out to Tyler. He made our experience that much more memorable. It was like he knew what we wanted before we ordered it. He was very friendly and lots of insight on the menu and different offerings. We were lucky to be seated in his section that day. He needs a medal or a raise would be better. 

The strip is a great place to hang out but most of the time you find overpriced food or restaurants that have a very trendy look inside with loud music blaring in the background. I was surprised to see such a simple yet classy looking set up at the Venetian. Yes, the food is not cheap but it is not that expensive. Our entire meal with several beers and cocktails ran me close to $130 which was not bad. Give them a try. BTW, uber from one end of the strip to the other is $8-14 depending on the time of day.

With all the breweries I hear are popping up in the QC, I just feel that my current favorite beer of NoDaRyzed will not be there for long.  After all it was only October or Noveber before my favorite was declared as Four Friends I-77 IPA.  

Dammit Charlotte!  Actually Charlotte I love you.  This is definitely a love/hate relationship.    

I love all the breweries popping up.  I love that I have a favorite at ALL of the breweries I've tried and I love that they are all different.

I was actually bored on Saturday and instead of pursuing my favorite pastime (hiking), i pursued my second (beer tasting)......yeah, I'm weird.  Get over it!!!!  

So I managed to pick a good time to hit NoDa...when I got there, the 3 stools at the right end of the bar were empty so I parked myself at the right end of the bar, leaving two empty seats at my left. 

I started out with at beer I was familiar with...the NoDaRyeZ'd which ?I had tried a couple weeks back at a Charlotte restaurant.  Yes, This is definitely my favorite brew in Charlotte.

I then tried the Flight (sampler).   All were great except I wasn't really impressed with Ramble on Red,  10 Block South was my 2nd favorite and the 2 dark beers were good considering I don't really like dark beers.

The staff at NoDA was exceptional....very friendly and it was great to meet the local business owners I met while sampling my beer.

Thanks NoDA ...you have now become my favorite brewery in Charlotte!",2012-02-12 00:26:08

If it DOES hang in there, then it's because the waiter, hostess and busser were all lovely people and were helpful. The food was what was a bit off. Which...hey...this IS an eatery. 

So, the magical Magic and I were together again, on a mission to get a replacement set of keys for my car, the current ones being 3-4 feet underground beneath my freshly-transplanted rosebush.

The mission was an utter failure. We needed pizza.

Driving toward Little Italy, I had it in my mind that we'd go to Mama Santa's, but the gigantic windows and breezy-ness of La Dolce Vita called from across the street. Who am I to turn down trying a new joint?

We jaywalked over to the hostess, a lovely lass who said it'd be fine to eat outside. They were just starting to set up, as it was a bit early...but they were glad to have us and made us comfy.

The waiter let us know about a couple wine specials, but we didn't take the bait. Magic was in the mood for something a bit more summery, and without a stutter he recommended a white wine with a slight pear flavor. He brought out sample tastes, and it hit the spot. Score for him and us.

The pizzas came out. I got pepperoni and mushroom, she got the four-cheese pizza.

Mine was...eh. It wasn't bad. But nowhere near the pizza that our favorite dark and dank place across the street fires up. 

Magic's four-cheese pizza made me yearn for my days in the Bronx, where I'd head to NY's true Little Italy (hint: Mulberry Street in Manhattan ain't it) and enjoy Giovannis four-cheese pizza, where the Gorgonzola bombs they'd strategically place would have you thinking about your last slice for a month. Fondly.

The food was disappointing. I feel bad...and I generally am a generous grader. But, being disappointed that you went there, on such an otherwise awesome evening, isn't a good thing.

So, La Dolce Vita. Keep the crew you got, keep the UNBELIEVABLE wine selection (tons of bottles, really)...but switch up the pizza recipe.

Their other food might be awesome. I hope it is.

But their pizza ain't.",2010-04-07 16:05:52

This place has a rip off wifi policy of requiring you to pay $11.95 for a 4 hour pass while you spend your $50 per steak in the restaurant... There is almost no cell signal since this spot in in the basement so if you need the Internet this is not the place.

The flat bread with hummus was pretty good too, a 4 out of 5!

I had a Mojito with 10 Kane rum, it was decent, about 3.9 out of 5 stars... Not much rum and less simple syrup than usual.

There was no pepper on the table which would be overlooked at a less expensive place... I grabbed it from the empty table next door.....

Décor : Ils ont deux étages, l'étage du haut semble mieux. Les bancs de bois sont moyennement confortables... Je ne sais pas pourquoi tous les Izakaya à Montréal se donnent le devoir de reproduire des bancs peu confortables... Les toilettes étaient propres. Ils nous ont mis sur le bord de la fenêtre, alors qu'il faisait -30, mais les places réservées n'étaient jamais comblées et finalement, l'étage du haut, que nous avons vu en allant à la salle de bain, était à moitié rempli. 

Nourriture: J'ai essayé les sashimis qui m'ont étonné positivement. Le saumon était dans une sauce ponzu et nous l'avons apprécié. J'ai pris de la pieuvre, croyant qu'il allait arriver sous la forme cuite (malgré que ce soit en sashimi) que nous avons dans les restaurants de sushis, mais non c'était crue. Pour l'expérience culinaire, ça valait la peine, mais c'est pas très appétissant du gris gluant de pieuvre. Ils ont une assiette de sashmis aux alentours de 13$ qui semblait très intéressante.  

Mon amie a pris des boules de pieuvre frits et du fromage frit. N'étant pas fan de friture, c'était mangeable selon moi, sans plus. Mon amie a apprécié le fromage, mais n'aimait pas le goût de la pieuvre frite. 

Nous avons également pris une soupe udon aux fruits de mer et un genre de bibimbap à l'anguille. Le bibimbap était correct, mais la soupe udon était décevant, car les fruits de mer c'était principalement de la goberge et un poisson frit. J'adore l'anguille, mais le reste de l'assaisonnement était ""fade"". Le positif, c'est qu'ils sont servis dans des portions généreuses. 

Ce qui semble intéressant, c'est qu'il offrait des huîtres que nous n'avons pas essayé ce jour là. Il y avait une promotion d'huître à 1$ le samedi après 21h30.

Il y a des images pour le menu. Ils offraient des makis sushis, mais ne semblaient pas spécialisés en sushis, alors nous n'avons pas essayés. 

Leur menu alcool était diversifié (cocktails, saké et bière japonaise). Il n'avait par contre pas la bière Kirin Ichiban offert sur leur menu. 

Service : On est allé un samedi soir et le restaurant n'était pas plein. Il y a eu un erreur dans notre commande en raison que le serveur n'a pas bien compris le numéro du plat en français... Sinon, le service était rapide, mais ils nous ont servi des petites entrées après la soupe et le bibimbap qui étaient pourtant des plats consistants.

After my most recent visit to Sammy's, I believe they are deserving of a better rating. 

As far as the food, we ordered the Kobe Beef chili, the kids' pepperoni pizza, LaDou's BBQ Chicken Pizza, & the Brie & Truffle Oil pizza on gluten-free crust. My boyfriend said the chili was tasty, but thought there wasn't much beef. All three pizzas were great. The Brie & Truffle Oil pizza is a new addition to their menu, and it was DELICIOUS! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...

I still don't care for the location, I wish they had more visual marketing to show they're back there with all the offices. I still think that the tapas are pretty pricey (unless you get there for half-off happy hour). Regardless, we loved the new revamped menu (labeling all vegetarian, vegan, & gluten-free items), and service was awesome!

XKee9b6LC9u6TZ_uyUgZeQ,YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,cVtpNvkn5e6DZ1HEZSSGTA,5,0,0,0,"Let me preface my standard review format by asking one question: What was NOT perfect about my experience at Le Bremner? F*ck all, that's what. 

Location: Tucked inconspicuously away on St. Paul, across from the Marché Bonsecours.  It's ten minutes away on foot from the Champ-de-Mars metro, and street parking is available (metered) and there's a parking lot next door ($15). If you're not paying attention, it's easy to walk by this place without seeing it. 

The place: With Chuck Hughes' celebrity status, I thought Le Bremner might be pretentious and full of snooty people. HOWEVER, I'm pleased to report that I was wrong. Located in the basement of a historic building, the restaurant boasts low ceilings, wood floors, a funky bar and a minimal but incredibly cozy decor. It's easy to imagine what this space looked like when the original Bremner owned the place. As far as patrons go, there was a good mix of people, and the vibe was friendly and casual. 

The food: It was more than I expected. In fact, it's two days later and I'm still full from Friday's dinner. My friend and I shared two appetizers: the Burrata and the porchetta with Kimchi and crackling. We were served the entire Burrata along with tomatoes and it was delicious. Truth be told, I've had Burrata that was a little more flavourful, but I'm not complaining. When I asked the waiter if it was imported from Italy, he looked at me like I was asking the most obvious question in the world. So, the answer to that question is duh, yes. Awesome. 

The porchetta was hands down, the best porchetta that I've ever had, EVER, and it currently rivals my original favourite from Dolcetto (sorry, guys!). The pork was melt-in-your mouth delicious and the Kimchi was the perfect accompaniment. I rarely eat meat (if ever), so if I'm singing its praises, you should take my word as gold and order this dish. No ifs, ands or buts. 

My main was the Turbo with nduja butter, broccoli and well, honestly, I was so focused on the size of the fish and the awesomeness of this dish that I can't remember any of the other ingredients. Our waitress expressed such excitement when I told her that I was thinking about ordering this fish, and after explaining that it was a new dish (or rather, a revamped version of a similar dish that she now considered to be perfect), I was sold. The Turbot was huge and took up almost my entire plate. A perfectly white fish, it was flakey and not at all fishy. The accompanying sauce was perfectly buttery, and the broccoli was amazing. I'm generally not a fan of broccoli but it was out of this world. I think they used a little balsamic to cook these, and it totally did the trick. My friend ordered the clam chowder and was completely enthralled. Every time I looked up at her, I found her smiling and muttering ""God, I'm so happy right now."" 

For dessert, I got the pot de crème: Abruzzo coffee, chocolate and caramel taffy (I think?). In any case, I think I cried a little as I ate this. It was so good, I was sorry to see the bottom of my perfect little tea cup. Overall, I could really taste the dark chocolate, but it wasn't sickeningly sweet. I would eat this every day if Chuck gave me a bulk discount. My friend ordered the pancakes and said they were great. Even though she was stuffed, she refused to leave the last pancake behind. When I suggested she do this, she gave me this look that implied I might be nuts, and informed me that she couldn't just 'leave it there.'

Service: Amazing. We were greeted by a friendly fellow whose name I didn't catch, and our water was refilled regularly - I didn't have to ask once for more water (they leave the bottle on your table). Our table was cleared after each dish and we were frequently asked how we enjoyed our dishes. Our regular waitress was Maude and she was awesome. She was super friendly, took the time to go through the menu with us, encouraged us to ask questions, made some suggestions and more importantly, she absolutely made sure that we knew how proud she is of the dishes they serve at Le Bremner. We really appreciated her attention to detail. Lastly, when I made a joke about hoping to see Chuck Hughes, she told me that Danny Smiles was working that night and offered to go see if he had a few minutes to stop by our table. It was great to end the night and we enjoyed meeting Danny. Thanks Maude & co. for an awesome evening!

Price point: Expensive. It ran us about $100 per person (including a glass of wine). Do I regret dining there? Hell no. The experience was worth every penny and I would definitely go back. It's the perfect place to go when you want to treat yourself.

Now, getting a reservation here is like winning the lottery so all I can say is try to plan in advance and call them about a month before you want to go. They don't take reservations more than 30 days in advance, and they're almost always full!",2014-11-02 19:18:32

The portions are always huge and it isn't very expensive to eat here.  Since I've been coming here there has also never been a line or wait for a table.

Still, my friend and I were on the strip and like Disneyland, overpriced food was inevitable. We sat on the bar stools overlooking the lounge across the cafe. The service was really good, we had a cool, flamboyant cashier who was very accomodating. 

I'd say it was very smart of the Cosmopolitan to fit in a little cafe amongst the high end shops and glittery chandelier lounges but if possible, perhaps cutting back on the pricing could help garner more customers, not that there weren't a lot when we went. People were enthusiastically handing over their $10-20 bills for a pastry and drink.

I have to admit the first time I went here several years ago I ordered a salad and thought...""eh, average food"" Don't get me wrong, the salad was decent...but really people, its a salad. So I never bothered to go out of my way to try this place again.

Now....fast forward a few years and a group of us decided to stop in for a quick bite and I ordered the wood fire grilled Western Burger. OMG! Delious! I craved this burger for 2 weeks until I begged the hubby for us to go back just so I could get it again! During that visit, my son had the Spicy burger and loved it as well. Our other son had the ribs and said they were best he has had in a long long time. I would have to agree and on our 4th visit I ordered my own and they are among the best. Fall off the bone yummy!

On our 5th visit, between the group of us we tried the steak (which was good, not great, but still tasty) the ribs again, the burger again, both excellent as always. A new item tried this visit was the fish club: a tasty piece of lightly battered cod with 3 large battered shrimp covered in melted cheese garnished with the standards on a soft hoagie bun - MY NEW FAVORITE FISH SAMMY!!! I know where my ""go to"" place will be during Lent this year!!!

On our 6th visit, our group stuck with the ribs, burgers and tried the wedding soup with good reviews and the steak hoagie which was stated as being very good; not the best he has had, but tasty none the less.

On our 7th visit, the burger, fish, ribs and wings was the groups decision. All well received as usual.

Are you seeing a pattern people?! lol....

While dining in, we noticed many many pizzas being served and they all looked amazing as they were delivered right from the wood fired ovens to the table. As also did the strombolis and calzones, which are next on our list to try.

As many others mentioned, there is a wide range of beer selections to choose from and coolers on the upper level for you to explore the assortment. The place is always busy, obviously for a reason. So get up and go try some great food at this local neighborhood favorite and you won't be disappointed.

Because the sign stated ONLY CASH will be accepted due to the card machines not working.  After I walked into the restaurant to let a petite blonde worker know, she looked disgusted. I thought if you hate your job that much get an education, learn a trade or apply for a job you do like. I requested to speak to a manager since the business should be made aware of the signs. There was even a typo. In this age of spellcheck -seriously?! 

The shift manager wasn't wearing a nametag and neither was the irritated petite blonde. I stated the problem to the shift manager and was informed that the card machines do work, sometimes . This begs the question of why maintenance isn't the norm. She asked if I was ordering or not. I answered in the affirmative.  I  ordered and requested a Mocha Frappuccino which was replacing the medium drink in the 2 cheeseburger meal. I was charged extra but didn't go back since the Friday night crowd was in force. My order wasn't read back to me and it was my fault that I didn't bring it to the unconcerned manager's attention.( I was at home when I read the receipt.)

However, I am on a veggie cleanse and after eating all the veggie dishes last night with a friend....it is as good as it gets! 

Paymon's is definitely a very good restaurant with a wide range of variety of dishes that a meat carnivore and veggie delight eater can both enjoy! 

As veggie delight eaters, we ordered the following:

STUFFED GRAPE LEAVES
Served cold as Paymon's Greek version of Dolmas consists of young, tender, grape leaves, stuffed with rice and flavorful herbs. Served with delicious Tzatziki sauce.

ATHENS FRIES
As it says on the menu, these fries are highly addictive and indeed they are! Addiction derives from their house seasoned fries accompanied by a delicious creamy dipping. Nevertheless, I like to dip mine with their special bottled hot sauce.

HUMMUS
One of my favorite delectable dip! Puree of chickpeas, Tahini, fresh garlic, olive oil and fresh lemon juice. 

BABA GANOSH
The name speaks for it self, it sounds like a hot Greek man riding on a white horse down the white sands of Greece....but it is a scrumptious mixture of seasoned, baked eggplant, blended with Tahini, fresh garlic, Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.

TABULI SALAD
What a fresh Mediterranean classic of a salad! Tabuli salad is combined with chopped parsley, bulgur wheat, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and fresh mint leaves. Tossed with their house seasonings, extra virgin Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  I know I know...it has gluten in it, but it's already hard to be gluten free so I ate it anyway! This salad is delicious!!

EGGPLANT PARMESAN
This Fresh Eggplant coated with Italian bread crumbs, layered with roasted whole garlic, Marinara sauce and topped with Mozzarella cheese was sooooo gooood!!!  It even came with Barilla penne pasta Marinara which made the dish so huge and plenty of left overs.

I heart Paymon's!!",2010-07-19 16:12:09

a) Milk Black Tea w/ Tapioca - This bubble tea is a little on the sweet side and they have the small tapioca as opposed to the traditional tapioca.  Luckily, I requested that the drink be less sweet (siu teem) and they were able to do that.  The tea itself is okay but I tend to like my bubble tea with a stronger taste of the tannins and I felt it was more milky than tea.  

b) Popcorn chicken - DELICIOUS!  A must-have at this place.  It was just the right amount of crispiness.  It is definitely one of my favourite dishes there. 

c) Taiwanese sausage - Another great dish!  I really wish they had garlic slices to accompany it because garlic and that sausage is a great complement of each other to off-set the saltiness of the sausage.  However, it was still very good without the garlic :)

d) Takoyaki - This was a very typical takoyaki dish.  It wasn't particularly special nor was it particularly bad.  I think that when I go there next time, I may stick to their Taiwanese dishes only. 

e) Fried Tofu - Also a pretty ordinary dish.  

Overall, the place is extremely busy and it's not a place for you to go and sit down and chat & catch up.  There are lots of people waiting and they need to be able to flip those tables fast so that they can give everyone a chance to enjoy their yummy food ^-^.

At first, I was expecting a large restaurant, probably the size of the Panera ahead. 
I came here in the afternoon (around 3pm) and the place was pretty empty. My friends and I sat beside the window and dined while looking onto Yonge Street. 
I loved the seating arrangement and how the restaurant felt casual yet kind of fancy. This place is perfect for any occasion, even a date. [One of my friends was already thinking about having a date here....and was definitely fond of the prices aha]
For four people, we ordered 2 dishes because we were tasting all sorts of food that day (just before this, we had burgers and ice cream). 
They were veggie pad thai and a seafood dish which name i do not recall. Out of all my friends that day, I would be the ""weakest"" when it comes to spice therefore, we ordered everything either regular/mild/medium. 
I was surprised that the dishes were able to keep their flavour without having spice overpower it. Although we were dying for water afterwards, the servers kept us hydrated for the majority of our stay.
I vividly remember one waiter coming over at least every 6 minutes. One time, he accidentally missed the cup while pouring and caused a minor spill. It was not bothersome however, he returned to wipe down the spill.

Prior to arriving to the restaurant the company had already emailed the chef what our orders were to be, but there was some confusion and two waiters came by to ask orders and write down what each person was going to eat. 

Our appetizers came out fast and the setting was nice and that's where the two stars came from. When our food came out that's when everything was messed up. They all of a sudden ran out of prime rib which we ordered 20 orders of! Then they forgot 6 of us! So 6 people were sitting without food while everyone else ate for at least 30 minutes after everyone else received food. Once most of everyone was served the waiters neglected to check on us to see if everyone was served. They left 1 person out and that person waited 1 hour to eat after everyone else was almost already finished. The staff was not accommodating at all either as we had kept asking what other choices do we have if you ran out of the food we has pre-ordered.

Anticipate a little wait time, they said about 45 minutes and as many restaurants on Ossington, just hang out and grab a drink in the bar next door.

Sat at the bar - which was perfect, space is tight so get cozy!

WONTON SOUP - this was very flavourful and there were 4 small wontons in it, it's a great appetizer dish with loads of veggies in it.

LAMB & DUCK PROSCUITTO DUMPLING - not my favourite, it was a bit dry and I am not a fan of deep fried stuff, but my dining partner enjoyed it so it may have just been me!

GRILLED CALAMARI AND SHRIMP WITH MANGO - this was good because I like mango and cilantro, if you are not either of those fans, this salad is not for you - the calamari was few far and in between but it was light and a good appie dish as well.

GRILLED PIKE MACKEREL WITH YUZU PONZU SAUCE - if you like whole fish, this is the dish for you!  I loved this dish, they de-bone it for you, which was great!  The taste was lemony with Japanese sauce with was salty but light.  

SLOW-BRAISED PORK BELLY WITH MOSCATEL REDUCTION - I don't know what moscatel reduction is - but it was so delicious, it came and it was dark looked crispy from the outside but it was so tender on the inside.  The favour was salty and rich - I could only have 3 bites and I was stuffed.

Of course, being a weekend night, I anticipated that the infamous line-ups will only be 10x's worse but I'm glad to say that they have made significant improvements in their wait times and service.

Our wait was perhaps 20-30 mins. long.  I definitely don't like waiting that long just for a meal but somehow, the expectation that Max's will seemingly ALWAYS have long line-ups sort of justified the wait and made it less painful.  We pondered over our menu choices in the mean time.  As soon as we were seated, we quickly placed our order to minimize the wait time for 1/2 fried chicken ($9.49), pancit canton ($8.99), kare-kare ($18.99), crispy pata ($13.99) and a large garlic rice ($3.99).  For dessert, we ordered halo-halo ($5.99).  So here's the lowdown:

Fried chicken: crispy and sinfully delicious as usual.  Can't go to Max's WITHOUT ordering it.  Just can't.

Pancit canton: nothing special.  A good base for the saltier entrees though.

Kare-kare: we've ordered it twice in three occasions dining here and each time, it just disappoints in the portion size.  A large bowl with extremely small meat portions...heck, I'm not even sure if there was actually any ox in there!  Very expensive for what you pay for.  I would recommend that you try it once just to say you did but then shelf it.

Crispy pata: another sinfully delicious deep-fried dish.  You know it's all fat and skin going down but you just can't help it.  Definitely not for the health-conscious.

Garlic rice: a let-down.  I expected more of a garlic flavour or something to do but essentially, it's just garlic bits in white rice.

Halo-halo: the BEST part of any filipino meal!  Beautifully colourful presentation complete with a little umbrella and a chunk of leche flan (no need to order as we were about to!).  Great tropical fruit bits.  Delicious to the final spoon.  Highly recommended every single time...although a bit of an ouch in the wallet, considering it's only dessert.

In terms of service, that was my biggest complaint in the two previous experiences there (see previous reviews).  It used to be extremely slow, inattentive and outright rude at one time.  This time, our waiter, Conrad, was a young fellow but very courteous, attentive and friendly.  He provided quick service to our family and we were very happy with him...a surprisingly pleasant change that perhaps may even redeem our previous negative experiences there.  We thanked him for his great service and made sure to tip him well...although we're certain the entire wait staff pools their tips.  

Overall, quite a costly price for a typical dinner out but it's okay to indulge every once in a while.  Definitely NOT for the health-conscious or calorie-wise as I tried to order a side salad and the waiter told me that nope, they don't serve salads at this time.  What?!  So even though I made the effort to add some greens to my largely fried carnivorous meal, I was denied that opportunity.  Definitely ended up overeating as there were no veggies (at all!) to fill my plates...ended up going home with a HUGE oversized stomach that actually hurt!  But it wasn't due to the food quality mind you...well, er, just the huge fried food portions.  A nice filipino dining experience for family and friends...but just try to watch the waistline if you can!  :D",2012-09-24 20:59:51

And without fellow Yelper organizing a 3# Burger Eating Challenge here, I would have totally not know about this little restaurant, which is located in Bally's.

The food I ordered while I was here to cheer on Anthony M (took on the 3# burger and did a respectable job of finishing 1/2 of it within the alloted 30 miniutes) was their full slab of ribs, which was flavored with a choice of their selection of BBQ sauces (I went with the Texas Double Pepper, which was supposed to be hot, but it was mild at best).  It tasted okay, not the best nor worst ribs I have tried in Las Vegas.

From the comments about the food others in our party had ordered, I think the food overall is just okay too. Price-wise I think it is about average for something you order inside a restaurant within a casino.

However, Tequila Bar and Grill does have some very attractive items on their menu that would definitely qualify as super value deals.  The $1 margaritas, the $1 tacos, $2 draft beers, $2 tequila shoots, $16 ""mountainous plate"" of nachos, $36 3lb burger (if you order it and split it 3 or 4-ways).

Service for large parties is not good.  I am thinking why would they work harder for their tips, when the 18% is already automatically added to your bill.  Our waitress never came back to check on us after we ordered, except to bring us our food.  Checking up on refills of beverages or additional orders only occurred after we frantically waved down the waitstaff.  The only time the waitress followed up was to hound me to pay my bill before I was even done with my ribs (definitely didn't like that).

About the 3# burger challenge.  Expect to wait an hour for the burger to finally be served.  I am guessing that they will have to bake the giant hamberger buns from scratch and make the giant patty too.  So if you are serious about trying to win the challenge and go hit the gem for 2 hours before tackling the burger, it might be strategic to have someone go and order it for you, so you can get there without waiting so long that you are no longer hungry before tackling the 5 pounds of food that comes with the 3# burger challenge burger.  Also order the burger rare, because if the 2 inches of beef patty is cooked any more, it will mostly be well-done.",2011-01-25 00:17:16

We ordered the friend green tomato blt, the slow pulled chicken salad and the wing with pickled okra. 

The fried green tomato BLT was incredible! Crispy, crunchy, tart fried tomatoes topped with pimento cheese, large slices of pork belly and frisée. It was salty, creamy and pure bliss. We loved this dish.

The wings were some of the best we've ordered. Double fried and tossed with a perfect buffalo sauce. Served with pickled okra that added a little sour to the salty wings and paired perfectly. The wings were served with a homemade buttermilk ranch sauce and we wanted more of it because it was so good. 

The slow pulled chicken salad was a large portion, full of flavorful smoked chicken, corn, layered on top of a piece of fried cornbread and buttermilk ranch with frisée tossed in a vinaigrette. It was unique and tasty. Very filling and full of lots of wonderful flavors

The only issue we had was that the bartender wasn't attentive to us. I ordered our blt appetizer right when we initially sat down, as I knew that was one thing I wanted to order and it took over 25 minutes to come out, after our entrees. He didn't apologize or say anything it and I was pretty surprised by that. He seemed irritated in general, even with other customers so I didn't bother saying anything. We had to wave him down for drinks and to order. 

I will likely go back, but I would grab a table instead of sitting at the bar.",2015-09-15 01:56:44

          If I love Marquee in Manhattan, I expect no less than the same management group to run Marquee Las Vegas. Always a good time here, despite the crazy crowd of freaking EDC sweaty crowd. We always have a great time here.

Just a few quick tips: 

- Don't even try to come here without table service, unless you are a hot girl. When I say hot girls I mean it. 

- Be classy, don't be a typical Vegas chic, chances are you will get it (without the table service)

- 3 levels so check out the music that you actually enjoy when you book your table via your host.

- 1 of the hottest clubs in Vegas

       Marquee is type of club if you get in, you enjoy it, and those that don't or can't afford the table service will bitch and moan about it. Remember this is a 5 diamonds hotel resort, so if you can't afford it, you should go else where to have a good time. Just don't ruin it for others. Nuff said!",2013-07-02 00:28:55

Went back about 9 months ago and the service was so bad we didn't stay.  Went back yesterday because I was in the area and still think about all of the good meals I have eaten there over the last 30 years.  The food was OK (flour chips are really the driving force here) and service was good.  The problem was they have gotten greedy.  In general the fool is a less than average value but OK.  Unfortunately yesterday we ordered a couple of Micheladas with our breakfast.  If you don't know what that is, its basically a beer with hot sauce and a lime in it service in a salted rim glass.  They served it in a typical 16 oz glass and unlike most other places filled the glass with ice.  It was tasty but . . . they charged us $8 apiece for them.  Really?  Probably 6 ounces of beer, a couple of dashes of hot sauce, a lime and some salt.  I am not poor but come on.  Most restaurants do not show cocktail prices on their menu but you expect they are going to be reasonable.  This is ridiculous and the last straw for this place.  We will NEVER return.  We laughed that someone has opened a Mexican restaurant right across the street.  We will try that next time or make the trip to Aunt Chiladas at the point where they also have flour chips but don't try to rip their customers off.  Get a clue folks.

No more is the place decked out in local and pop culture memorabilia and Tiffany lamps, it's a little more chic than it used to be....for a chain restaurant at least. 

It's been a long while since I've been to Ruby Tuesday but I recently signed up for their email list which opens the doors to many perks such as BOGO coupons emailed to you, special offers and a birthday meal. I like birthdays. I like meals. When I saw I had a coupon for a free handcrafted burger soon to expire, I know where I was going for dinner! 

The place is a little obscure in location-right in the middle of a business park off Arrowood and 77. You can see it easily from 77 but when I exited on Arrowood, a bit confused where to turn so I follow the red. I turned into Oak Hill Business Park then made an immediate right and there I was. It was a little slow for a Thursday night but what can you expect on a chilly night. I was dining solo so opted for the bar where I could watch hockey or hoops on one of their many tv's and was soon greeted by the bartender. She told me the selection of draft beers they have on hand (about six to seven with two types of Sam Adams, wooooo!) and was quick with a pour. I was the only chick in the bar and felt like the only one not there on business since there are three or four hotels within a 1/2 mile radius. 

Even though I was getting a burger of sorts, I still scoured the menu and saw they have Sunday brunch served until 3PM, news to me, will have to check out! I got some complimentary biscuits while waiting for my food--think smaller, less cheesy knock off of Red Lobster's cheesy biscuits. Tasty and just enough to hold me over until my meal.I got the Alpine Swiss Burger which came out in no time along with their endless fries. The fries were crispy, fried, salty goodness. My only complaint is now they they are a tad more chic, the ketchup is served in ramekins and not a bottle in sight. I put ketchup on everything so I like to have a bottle within reaching distance but they were happy to offer me more when they saw I was running low. And the burger? Succulent with just enough toppings to make it fun yet not fall apart. I think the menu said it was 8 oz and it was a lot better than I expected. 

I had a pleasant experience and look forward to going more now that I'm getting coupons on the regular. I'm not really big into chain restaurants but if you can offer me values for giving you business, I will be loyal.

Ten Foot Henry is one of Calgary's newest places to open up in the last few months and they have slowly being making a name for themselves. I absolutely love the feeling that you're walking into this beautiful, modern-lookin garden, filled with contemporary pieces like geometric vases and hanging fairy lights and plants. I absolutely loved the ambiance of the place! 

Our server was excellent and very cheery about this being our first experience and was really helpful in recommending specific dishes to try for the first time. One thing I noticed right away was the amount of vegetarian and vegan options they had on the menu! Don't get me wrong, I'm a meat eater if you ever come across one, but I find that it's sometimes hard to find places with more then one or two veggie options, which can be tricky when you're going out with vegetarian friends. 

Everything is done family style and I recommend approx. 4-5 dishes between 2 people. I would lean towards more 5 if you're more on the hungrier side. Everything we had was very fresh and bursting with flavour. My particular favourites were the crudo and tomatoes. The crudo had capers and dill with this amazing chimichuri and sesame oil over top, it was incredibly fresh and the sashimi just melts in your mouth. I'm not a particular fan of tomatoes, but I'm slowly starting to enjoy them based on the way they are prepared, and TFH knocked it out of the park! The warmed tomatoes were mixed with whipped feta and herbs that you put on top of toasted pieces of sour dough. The flavour is amazing and richness of the feta isn't as powering and it balances out with the sweetness of the tomatoes wonderfully. The hanger steak and gai lan with miso were also really nice. I wasn't a huge fan of the dumping with borscht as I fell short compared to the other dishes, but my girlfriend loved it as she's German. Although we didn't get to try the coconut cake, it sounds like something that can't be passed up and I will for sure give it a try the next time I go.

The pineapple was good but not something I would normally dip chips into, the regular was really sweet but the arbol was my favorite. It tasted more like traditional salsa to me. 
We ordered the veggie tacos to split with a side of the jalapeno grits. The grits were amazing. They were absolutely delicious. The tacos were also really delicious, the veggies are lightly battered and the taco had an almost asian inspired flavor as well.

I am a vegetarian who occasionally eats fish (like maybe 5 times a year) so luckily it wasn't that I was allergic but I was still deeply upset about the fact that there was fish in there. It seemed careless that that could happen especially considering that someone could be allergic to it. I do realize that this is a fish establishment but someone should be able to order veggie tacos without fear of getting fish in it. The second taco in the order that my husband was eating also had a small piece of fish in it as well. 

The second factor for me was the atmosphere/service. We sat at the bar to eat since we weren't ordering much and didn't want to take up a table. The folks who worked there were very loud and didn't seem to care at all about what they talked about in front of the customers. There were several conversations happening that I wish I hadn't heard.

I would like to try eating here again as the flavors were really good but perhaps I will order out and see if I have any more issues with the food.",2014-06-21 15:55:31

""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.""

'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.

I got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager ""saved"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. ""Why don't you like caraway?"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, ""I really don't like the taste."" When she asked me ""Why?"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the ""sauce"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that ""real"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. 

Hence, the grilled cheese.",2009-06-16 03:09:23

The problem with pho is that the noodles are terrible once they've sat for a day in broth.  The Mi La-Kai solves this by serving the broth on the side!

So, you get a bowl of delicious pork soup with cilantro (that I could seriously just drink by itself), and you get a bowl of noodles, shredded chicken, bbq pork slices, meatballs, fishballs, little shrimps, scallion, lettuce and crushed chilies in a very light oyster sauce.  Grab your chopsticks and dip as you go.  Leftovers are packaged separately, so the next day the noodles are still chewy and the lettuce is still crisp.

We ordered some nigri sushi and some of the skewers (bacon wrapped scallops - decent; beef tongue - under-seasoned, disappointed).  Most of the fish are good, but some were not too fresh.  

Also tried the Sweety Roll (based on previous Yelp review) and was really disappointed at how this tempura-style roll turned out to be.  The roll is big, but also filled with mostly rice.  The eel sauce it was dressed with tasted burnt=bitter, which is mostly not how eel sauce is supposed to taste like here normally.

Also tried the Rock & Roll (which the waiter said was a cucumber wrapped roll without rice) served with a kiwi sauce.  When the roll arrived, I can clearly see that whoever prepared it was no experienced sushi master or even someone with a decent knife skill (cucumber slice was uneven and on the thick side). The roll is also wrapped in seaweed with lots of rice and the fish described in the menu, which is then wrapped in the thick cucumber sheet. The kiwi sauce was okay, most likely made by blending mayo + some kiwi + sugar, which I thought was interesting to try, but nothing to write home to rave about.

Service from the waitstaff also suffered once we have been there for about 30 minutes, since there were a few groups of 5 or 6 that arrived. It was difficult to place new orders, get refills on our beverages, until additional waitstaff stepped in to help out.

Overall, I would say that it is a decent AYCE sushi experience for the $29 (incl tax and tip, no other beverages).  But if you go, stick to their nigiri and appetizer menu.  The special rolls sounds good on paper, but falls short on taste and execution. Also sit at the sushi bar if you can, so you can at least ask the sushi chefs what fish is fresh and what you should avoid.",2009-09-12 09:33:36

We arrived and asked for a table for 2 - we got seated at a table for 4. Weird, since the restaurant was about 20% full and there were still a handful of 2-person tables, but whatever. About 10 minutes later, another party of 2 is put at our 4-person table :/ Awkward. And there are STILL numerous tables for 2 in the other half of the restaurant. Apparently the waitress tried seating them closer to the door with another group but it was too cramped so they declined and was then sat with us. I'm not exactly sure what their system for seating is, but it was uncomfortable all around. I've honestly never heard of communal seating with parties of 2 or more - usually just single diners at a large table, like at King's Noodle.

As for the food, it was decent. We got the Sweet and Spicy Chicken and Bulgogi main entrees. The thing to note is that some mains DO NOT come with rice, which is super weird. You're basically paying extra for something that would normally come with the main at other Korean restaurants. The menu also doesn't note which entree doesn't come with rice so you have to ask when ordering. Overall, it came to just over $40 for two dishes and an extra rice.

Crudo... wonderful pops of pomegranate with the hamachi, jalapeño salsa, and radish.  I saw a lady two seats away eating this with chopsticks and I said I'll start with that.

A foodie sat next to me, ordered the same thing I did since I thought it was delicious!  His had huge cracked grains of salt on it, unlike mine.  He ordered many things and was not happy with the meals or service.  He was so disappointed that he called the manager over eventually.

Let's start with my favorite dishes.  

King Crab!  An absolute must that I regularly get since service and food has been so inconsistent.  I know that this has been beautiful every time.  The devil dip and lemon, so fresh and served in a lovely iced brass looking bowl.   

Ricotta Agnolotti worth every bite of this sweet butternut squash and ricotta salate.  Not a picture worthy presentation, none the less I took the pic, it was very tasty.  Brown butter sage kicked it up a notch.  

Shrimp Ceviche... served once with saltines??  Cilantro, lime and chili, was missing something.  Served 'Baja style.'  The lavash spruced it up wonderfully.  
Btw, I had to ask for the lavash after seeing that everyone on the far right had it.  Blame it on the inconsistent bar service.  

Beet Salad w/ Humbolt Fog Cheese, red wine vinaigrette, nice crispy chickpeas, however I hate to be Anton Ego, but if you're across from Bardot, whom I believe has the best Beet salad, you'd better bring your A game.  Beet Salad not even close to Bardot.  

Yellowfin Tuna... over cooked, no sauce to help the dryness of the 'dry rub'.... the gorgeous yellowtail wasn't wasted, although it was cooked to death so I asked for sauce to finish it.  Served with red wine, peppercorn, shiitake and bok choy.  Horrible.

Panna Cotta was served with Cracker Jacks on it, no clue why I ordered it at a Seafood restaurant, cause it was horrible.  Yes I love dessert too, but only ate the Cracker Jacks.  

To each their own, but my friend got the Wings.  Yes, a seafood restaurant with chicken wings, nothing special like a 'Blue Ribbon' kick.  Looked way better than they tasted, garlic, chili, cilantro and peanut sauce.  Needed ranch, the sauce was too much.    

I hate to say that I'd never be back cause I do love the King Crab and had high hopes for this Aria location of Herringbone.  Maybe I will try brunch outside, cause I do not like the indoor seating, seems silly to me so I have been at the bar, where the service has been inconsistent.

The wait was forever long for our party of three. I think the problem with this place (in terms of wait times) is the tables are way too large and they'll seat parties of two at tables that seat six. The menu was small before and it is still small. They replaced the Reuben with a cheese steak this time. We were expecting the quality of food to be the same but sadly, it was not. Our table ordered the soup of the day (cream of cauliflower and leek), mac and cheese, gumbo, halusky and cheese steak along with several cocktails. Of all the dishes we sampled, the soup and mac and cheese were the best. In fact, we could've licked the bowl clean after the mac and cheese. We added hot sauce to it for an additional $.50 and it was worth it. The worst was probably a tie between the gumbo and the cheese steak. The gumbo was basically a shredded beef stew, lacking much depth of flavor. And the cheese steak consisted of mostly bread. The roll they used was perhaps too thick for their small portion of sandwich makings. I remember raving about the homemade pickles before but they fell short this time. I don't think they were ready as pickles yet; this time, they were basically just slices of cucumbers. I really hope they're not cutting corners now after having found some success.

I was prepared to give the store 4 stars.  Then I saw on one of their flat panel displays that change messages, a sign saying ""People Love us on Yelp.""  How could I not give them the extra star?

Nice bar stools along the window, a nice round conversation pit like seating in the center, and some tables make it an inviting place.  Price of yogurt is $.39 per ounce so it's on the pricier side.   They do have a loyalty card for repeated visits. Purchase 7, 10 ounce yogurts and get the 8th, 10 ounce yogurt free.

There are tons of street chic art hung all over the walls of the restaurant which makes its interior design fun and appealing for guests. Since it's  more of a casual setting it's a nice place to bring friends even if you don't plan on going to Marquee or anywhere else fancy for the night.  

They have shakes mixed WITH alcohol, called their bam-boozled shakes. My absolute favorite is the Birthday Cake which has 3 Olives Cake Vodka, Birthday Cake Crumble, vanilla ice cream and sprinkles. OHHH SOOO GOOD. It. Is. To. Die. For. Plus they give you the tin they make the shake in so it feels like you're getting extra. Adding a little to the waist? I don't mind for this heavenly treat.

The sides are fantastic. Truffle lobster Mac n cheese... Need I say more? They have great tiny buns too and some great Chicago dogs if you aren't too hungry, but still want a great meal. 

Now the burgers are what you should come here for. Try any one. I'm sure there isn't one that will disappoint your taste buds. Can't choose? Well you can't ever go wrong with the Gold Standard. All the burgers come with either shoestring fries or steak fries. Just perfect. Prices might be a bit high, but you are paying for quality food.

It's been about a week since I've had you, and I dearly miss you so.  I know we haven't known each other that long, but it really seems like there's a strong connection there for me.  That first time we met, your Red Velvet led me to thinking about what a great classic bakery you are, with good values and traditional favors.  I immediately felt good about a stable relationship for us. 

Little did I know, you are full of surprises.  The next time we met, you seduced me with your Nutella, so indulgent and sinful was this rendezvous.  Although I was becoming addicted to you, I was also becoming fearful that you had many other suitors, considering the multitude of favors you offered.

Not only are you a seductress, you are also an island flirt.  The next time we met, I had your Passionfruit, delicious and light.  I was now convinced this love was going to have to be shared.  And after much contemplation, I've decided to accept your popularity among the masses.  After all, what good is favor and beauty if only to one?  I love you, and I always will.  But it's quite all right for others to love you as well.

Until we meet again, I hold you in my thoughts.

xoxo.

When I got home and answered the query ""where did you go for drinks?"", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(

Because, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)

You know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!

T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say ""everything is good"" when you ask for their recommendations:)

Maybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)

I have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)

I was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)

We had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)

Onion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)

Carin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:) 

I know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)

I had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)

They also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)

We had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)

I tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)

Time really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)

But such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire ""do you love everything?"":)

It was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!

But we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)",2009-08-24 23:55:19

I'm a huge eggs benny fan so their Bennyrama menu caught my eye.  What especially caught my eye was their Smoked Kielbasa & Swiss Benny. The platter came with their perfectly seasoned and fried homefries which alone, I'd go back for.  It was THAT good! I'd give that 5/5.  

Their portion was also pretty generous as with the amount of kielbasa they give you.  Was thickly cut and grilled nicely.  A little bit on the bland side but I would still order the kielbasa on its own as a side if I were to create my own platter.  I'd rate the kielbasa 4/5.

The eggs however were a huge disappointment.  It was so overcooked that they were practically hard boiled eggs.  I thought it was just mine but my friend who ordered the Eggs Florentine had the same thing.  Either the cook needs to learn how to properly poach an egg or they need to ask their customers if they want their eggs well done.  I personally prefer my eggs to be poached just enough that the yolk is still runny.  The hollandaise sauce also could've used a little more lemon.  If I were to rate the eggs alone, I'd rate it 0/5.  

As I enjoyed it enough (again, where can you get kielbasa on an eggs benny and those amazing homefries?!) I would go back but will have to make sure that they are advised not to overcook the eggs.",2015-11-24 23:47:39

Not much my friends. Not much. I haven't bowled much in AZ so I wasn't really sure what to expect, and I have to admit, that there were some major differences from when I bowl with my family elsewhere. 

The biggest? The bowling balls were behind the counter. Is this normal in AZ? I understand people seem to love to steal the shoes, but do people really try to steal bowling balls? It totally sucked to have to go to the counter to test out bowling balls between frames to find a good weight.

They kind of made up for this by having PBR on tap, but were brought back down again by not having the ginger in the Jameson & Ginger as advertised. Upon asking, they made a ginger ale (the coke crap) and well I really wanted some so it was acceptable. I remember my quote being, ""This isn't bad for a fake ginger ale & Jameson."" I'm not quite sure if I liked that they came and got my order at the lanes or not. They were pretty insistent on me not heading to the bar to order my drink, even though I had no clue what they had, so I needed to scope it out. If you want to server people, that's fantastic. Really. I'm a fan. But have the menu by the lanes.

All in all the lanes were easy to use and we didn't have too many issues we needed assistance with other than a bowling ball that kept getting stuck in the return. A total of maybe 6 times. In 2 games. Bonus for being able to customize your ""theme."" Anti-bonus for the crappy ads to the left when no one's playing beside you. The only food that looked good on that screen was the chocolate chip cookies. And those guys that are advertising bowling safety, do not look like bowlers. 

We paid for our shoes up front and the games when we finished. It was pretty easy and the rates weren't that bad in my opinion. Sounds like this may become an occasional thing, though in which case, I'll have to up my game. The boys all crushed my so-called bowling skills.",2011-04-30 16:38:21

1) Service is inconsistent - sometimes courteous, quick and spot on (usually the Sunday AM lady who is currently out due to knee surgery), but sometimes they are slow and get the order all wacked up and forget things. 
2) the blender is near where the person taking the order often stands.  ""I'd like a wrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  A what? whrrrrrrrrrrrrr....

I know this will sound made up, but believe me it is all true. Couple nights before New Year's Eve. I was at a swinging party on Lakewood's north side. Me and three girls. Two were sisters! We were all schmoozing, taking pictures, drinking some Stoli and cola. We were talking about some racy movies we had seen recently. You know, like Battlefield Earth and stuff. Now here's where it gets weird. 

It's about one in the morning. A very sexy time of night. I started to feel this strange sensation take over my body. I was getting a craving. For something hot. Oh yeah, hot and gooey. Something I could rip apart and shove my face in to. A box. Full of pizza. So I left and went down the street. Bars were emptying out. Women were stumbling around, flashing their goods, screaming in ecstasy. Or you know, vomitous sickness. I saw a neon light. Like the kind you see all over the seedy part of town. It said ""OPEN"". Yeah, that's how I like it. I called the number in the window. A sultry lady's voice cooed over the line, ""Thank you for calling Nunzio's, how can I help you?"" I had to loosen my tie. ""(gulp), I'd like two pizzas. Large."" 

""Large? Okay, what do you want on them?"", she purred. I asked for black olives on one. And asked for the other one bare. Mmmmmmm, bare. ""Twenty minutes. What's your name?"", she beckoned. I could barely speak from the excitement. I waited in my car. I could see there were TWO ladies in the shop. Two exotic Sicilian ladies kneading dough with their firm hands. They wiped sweat from their brows. Oh to be the kitchen towel that caught some of that sweat. Then the big moment came. I went to the door. They told me to come in. She told me the price. This wasn't the first time I'd paid for it. Whipped out my, ahem, debit card. The heat of the pizza shop made me delirious. Like a Bangkok hotel. I stepped out into the cold Cleveland air with my two hot numbers in my arms. I quickly raced home to have my way with my saucy Italian tarts. Let's just say when it was all over, I was beyond satisfied. Late at night, when no one else is available, Nunzio's is the place to go for some cheap fantasy fulfillment.

 For sides we asked for two french fry baskets and onion rings. I filled my drink and was waiting for my food when a younger guy who was behind us in line walked in front of me to grab his burger, and took our order of onion rings. At first I assumed he had asked for some as well and since his order was for one person, and ours for three, I figured it took less time for his to be done. But as I waited to see if any more onion rings were being fried up, no one started them. I mentioned this to the cashier and he told me that this happens often and it doesn't really matter because you pay for everything at the register when you get to the end so it's not like people walk away with your food free. Still he had to ask the cook to put in a new batch of rings and it took a minute or two. Obviously I should be taking stars away from that oh so respectful gentleman that needed onion rings in a hurry, but he is probably out playing beer pong or tubing down the salt river.

I can only give NCBAP 4/5 stars because of the typical problem experienced when females visit most venues, the bathroom wait.",2012-06-05 20:38:09
PyRCSRAlL9SrNaNO71ixuA,YWWDhFvemd93HKof8D-QoA,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,5,4,3,3,"I vowed to go back to Hash House A Go Go after trying it for the first time at the Imperial Palace and not liking what I ordered (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?hrid=iNK3civmn3ucUVSnXr1Xeg).  What brought me back was seeing how great everyone else's food looked compared to mine.  I was very disappointed the first time around and had to give it another shot. I was already staying at the Rio, so this location was very convenient.  There were several things that I liked better about this Hash House than at the Imperial Palace, mostly that it felt less stuffy.  Overall, it was a much better dining experience. 

My instincts to give it another shot paid off as I really enjoyed my food.  I ordered the bacon waffle, which was a waffle with bacon in the center that stuck out of each corner.  My plan was to order a waffle and a side of bacon, but this covered all my bases!  It was slightly on the salty side, but my waiter had warned me about that prior to ordering.  It was a unique and tasty breakfast plate that I thoroughly enjoyed.  

My opinion of Hash House A Go Go significantly upgraded after this visit.  The food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent.  There were also many other things on the menu that I would like to try and I look forward to going back.",2014-11-05 18:21:18
UEJnrNfp5_4rEji1_LVG7A,yL4whR1Qb63FptG9IVRdVQ,Z_mJYg3vi8cPZHa1J4BALw,5,7,2,5,"We visited Kindred shortly after their opening in late February, and had a fabulous meal.  It's a high end, special occasion kind of place, but one that we'll likely visit often because we loved it so much.

The restaurant is beautiful inside, with two levels to accommodate diners.  We sat upstairs, and loved the airy feeling and view through the large exterior windows.

Every table gets a milk bread, free of charge.  It's served in a bucket with four pull-apart pieces and a salty top.  Wow - it was good, especially with their hand-churned butter!  Additional orders are $5, and I had to hold myself back from ordering another.

We love meat and cheese trays, and were excited to see that Kindred offers both house-made meats (four for $14), and cheeses that you can select individually (at $4 each).  AND, they have our absolute favorite cheese, sottocenere.  Yes, our $30 meat and cheese tray was pricey, but we loved it.

For our entrees, I had the venison tagliolini.  It was a small portion at a very reasonable $16.  The venison was very tender, and the creamy sauce was delicious, and not too heavy.  My husband had the pork arista at $24.  It was a huge and very tender chop, served over grits (or, was it polenta?).  He added the duck fat fries, which we both enjoyed.

I can't say enough good things about the service; everyone was pleasant and prompt.  It's especially nice having someone come to your table to explain the cheeses, and slice them upon request. 

We left comfortably full.  And I still salivate thinking of their milk bread.  I'm already planning our next visit!",2015-03-25 00:21:33

You learn that your two year old vehicle eventually requires a smog test. What the f&!?% is a smog test?? Well if you have eyes I'm pretty sure you see signs every where, ALL the time that says ""SMOG TEST"". Just follow the signs like I did. LOL, kidding.

I went to a place that charged $22. In situations like this, I would either call my daddy or my boyfie. That's what men are for right?? I'm just playing. I called the bae. He told me I shouldn't be paying more than $15. And if I am; then see if they have any discounts or coupons online or through our mail. I left. Opened up my Yelp app and this place was around the block. They had an offer for $7.77 if you checked in.

I called for a price check ($11.99) and asked if they were still offering the $7.77 check in deal. She said yes. I was on my way from there. I was in and out within 20 minutes. They also did a comp check on my car. Which was nice and offered a few services. But I nicely declined. I was able to pay my registration at a kiosk nearby right after.",2016-03-26 00:02:26
Blj9xhHnNpPWwYbhhJypLA,2uPLcgkgFNOR-Ing4TqtRA,vWnCZVeggUGMd_cXlBohwQ,5,1,0,0,"NO - S.J. from Tempe I am by far the pickest person you'll ever meet - normally my reviews are far from good ones unless deserved.  Now in this case I AM from the Chicago suburbs and definitely know a good pizza when I eat one !! Also, have eaten at numerous Rosati's here and in IL and this particular location by far is the BEST !!!

We (our whole family) live in Gilbert - not exactly next door, and there are numerous pizza places (or so called ones) and we drive to this particular one for the FOOD and the FRIENDLY WAIT STAFF... NO we don't know the owner nor are we related just an average customer who happens to like so far anything we've gotten at this particular location.  We have NEVER found them to be padding the bill or any inuendo's of the sort.  The quality of the food is always the finest of ingredients on and on.

If there is 1 negative I will say spiff up your restrooms and definitely get new booths they all are like sitting in a hole.

So anyone wanting the BEST PIZZA in the EAST VALLEY please give this Rosati location a try !!!!",2013-08-10 18:42:18
