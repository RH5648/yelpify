Sadly, the location is not handicap accessible which proved to be difficult when going up the many stairs. However, if you did manage to do so there is plenty of space to move around without bumping into people or other objects. In fact, I love the layout! The interior had this casual/industrial look that I found cozy. 

Price wise- I've seen better, especially for chemical infused tobacco instead of tar free. And my plain Jane cranberry juice was definitely not cranberry juice but maybe a watered down version or old kool-aid? But over all, this place is worth a visit if you're close by. My friends & I got the Blackberry flavored tobacco and it had a nice flavor to it. For 3 drinks & a hookah it was only $22.00 (not including tip) - so its somewhat budget friendly. And our server(s) were nice & attentive :)",2013-08-05 18:30:21

I decided to give this place a try because its literally minutes from my house and they were rated well here on Yelp. I called in and was able to get an appointment within the hour which I really liked.

I had originally thought about getting a regular polish fill but upon arrival they had so many beautiful gel options I was swayed to opt for a gel fill instead.

Shannon was amazing! I really liked her vibe and I instantly felt comfortable around her. She did a great job with shaping my nails ( They are coffin shape the picture doesn't really do them justice).

I loved the way they came out, and for those of you who think that you can't pull off loud colors like these, life is too short for boring nails!! I did not like the price however. At my usual place for a fill whether it be gel or polish and whether I chose to get nail art or builds or studs or crystals its never more than $25.00. One time I got a gel fill with Loluboutin under nails (where they paint the underside of your nails as well.) and with crystal nail art and I paid $25.00 plus tip.

Here it was $56.00 for a gel fill with what they consider to be nail art (The glitter shade). They did give me 20% off since it was my first time but that's still $47.00 for a gel fill.

Like I said this is a terrific salon and I would definitely recommend Shannon! I will just probably make the drive up to my usual place from now on.",2016-07-04 18:02:16

kVSAWZlTDrbLLQVrdZ0Fxw,Z0GBHiE7QpWlymLMnUP8SA,W2RNay2mirTVPYO6rA_g2g,2,9,4,2,"Let me start by saying that I LOOOOOVE me some Chipotle. Usually. 

This has got to be the worst-run Chipotle in Cleveland. Definitely the worst I've ever been to.  And it's 100% about the service. Bad service just drives me crazy, because it's so easy to fix. 

Advice to employees at this location:

1. I do not want to repeat my order 3 times. Please listen to me the first time. If you get interrupted and forget, I understand. But in this case you say 'I'm sorry, what was your order again?'  You don't simply repeat the question as if you'd never asked it at all. 

2. If you are clearly the manager of the place, try not to be the douchiest guy there and assume that everyone wants to hear your extra-loud banter about non-Chipotle related topics. Try also to actually DO something rather than just stand around. The line is long so we've got plenty of time to watch you be useless. 

3.  If I say 'just a little sour cream', that means you should start with considerably less sour cream than you would normally add. A burrito with just the right amount tastes awesome. Too much sour cream ruins the entire thing. I can't tell you how many times this has happened. SO annoying. 

I would not be giving this harsh a review of the service had the above happened once, twice, even 3 or 4 times. I live less than a mile from this location so I've been there a bunch and lately, it's like that EVERY single time. 

Over it. Going to the Kamm's Corners location whenever possible from now on.",2013-08-16 06:15:13

I started with a Bloody Mary which was pretty good. For my main meal I ordered the pancakes with eggs and sausage (and another Bloody Mary:) and to start off with I opted for an order of the biscuits and gravy - they should call it biscuit and gravy because we only got 1 biscuit. 

Upon starting my third Bloody Mary I received my main meal and I could already tell the pancakes weren't gonna be amazing (you gotta know that I'm a pancake connoisseur, so I have high, but fair standards) and I was unfortunately correct. The pancakes were on the drier side and not fluffy at all. The sausage (which was highly recommended) had an odd taste and I did not enjoy it; the eggs were probably the best part, but you really can't screw that up. 

On a lighter note, my wife enjoyed the breakfast enchiladas! They were so big you could split them with a second person.

Love the dark pub atmosphere and the restaurant is very thoughtfully decorated.  A decent selection of local beers on tap, and the chalkboard menu of specials was fab!  We started w the octopus appetizer.  Good thing we only ordered 1 app because it was a huge serving and came with sides (fingerling potatoes and spring mix).  Very yummy, although wished it was a bit more charred.  For the entree, I got the Arctic char fish with butternut squash purée and asparagus, which was a chalkboard menu special, and it was simply perfect!  My fish was tender, while the outside was crispy!  Loved it!  My boyfriend had the duck breast and it was good too although he wasn't a fan of the apricot purée (think it's just his personal preference).  We were too full to have any dessert, but the selection looked yummy.

WalMart was originally a lower price option, but lately I find their prices average or sometimes higher than the alternatives. The thing with WalMart is when they have a sale, they do it right.

Walking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.

Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.

As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.

But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.

And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.

The Visitor Center had a movie running in the exhibit area that lasted over an hour. It was about Harriet Tubman helping free the slaves, and had a Christmas theme. We caught parts of it on the way in and out... It was really a bit slooow for this sort of place.

The Visitor Center exhibits explain a lot about the folks who lived there a long time ago, and they display some of their relics. You can also grab some refreshments and souvenirs, if interested.

The large house is fully decorated, and we took a tour that showed us how folks lived back then. It was moderately elegant, but life was still hard. 

There was a weaver working upstairs, and museum workers in each room showed us some of the features of the house.

When he took them to the register it turned out that they were marked down another 50%. The cashier pointed out that he saved more than he spent. I started postulating that if we kept shopping we could actually eventually make money...I think she believed me. 

Going with my theory we shopped on. I found the most amazing and sexy pair of shoes by famous American designer and Project Runway judge Michael Kors. They have high heels, laces and lucite...sssssexy! Of course, they were on sale. I was trying to rationalize spending that much money (even on sale they were pricey) on shoes...took about 2 minutes.

All you can eat sounds fantastic, but you don't realize how filing sushi and hibachi actually are until you've ordered and realize you can't possibly eat another round. I ordered two sushi rolls and the chicken and shrimp hibachi and was done. There are a ton of appetizer options (dumplings and such), sushi and sashimi, and different proteins to add to your hibachi. But you better come hungry - like haven't eaten in a full day hungry - in order to prepare yourself, otherwise I feel like you don't really get your $25/meal worth. 

My dining partner choose the hot pot, which I would eventually like to try, though it makes me a little nervous to not only choose from all the different options, but to make sure I've properly cooked everything in my selected broth. When I become brave enough, I'll give it a shot.

So, now I've been here about 7 or 8 times in 6 weeks.  That seems reasonable, right?......... 
Overall, the ambiance is great - ALWAYS lively (make a reservation!  Even during the week, even just for 2... do it), high ceilings, classy but not overly fancy.  Definitely a bit pretentious, but not terrible.  

Must-get favourites:  
Croquetas de jamon (ham croquettes):  SO.  GOOD.  
Patatas Bravas (cubed potatoes with a mild spicy sauce and a fried egg):  Perfection, and tastes very much like the many many patatas bravas dishes I had in Spain.  
Datiles:  Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with a pepper.  Sweet, Savoury, and spicy, all in one.  
Empanadas:  Moist, tasty empanadas with... I think chicken?  Can't remember
Seleccion:  Can't remember the full name, but the meat tray is delicious.  A bit expensive, but you get quite a bit of meat.  


Skip:
Paella:  I was pretty disappointed in the Paella.  Pretty bland.  
Goat cheese and honey - was just kind of boring 
Cheese selections - they are good, but you get 2 thin slices of cheese for $9.... not a good deal.  
Pimintos de padron:  Except for the novelty (some of them are extra spicy, while the others only have a hint of spice, so it's like russian roulette of peppers), these just aren't that good.  And it's a whole lot of peppers (12 or so), so maybe not bad for a group of 4-6.  Not tasty enough for me to eat 6 if it's just two of us...

Anyway, the selection and quality of food is really good.  The store is smaller than I expected, but every inch of the store is stocked with quality goods.

Meaning, that I have not had the opportunity to determine whether the food and service that I experienced is now consistent, or consistently better than the prior reviews listed here.

To my fellow Yelpers here, I am sorry, I completely disagree with your expectations that a restaurant is responsible for the behavior of the children frequenting it.  The restaurant should be rated on what is in its control.  I do not work, nor have ever actually worked, in a restaurant, but I am able to recognize how difficult it would be for a restaurant Manager/Owner to comment on the behavior of the children of their patrons without offending them and losing them as customers altogether.

I attended a networking event at this restaurant last night and was quite pleased.  I love the bar.  But it is not a Legends or a Zipps, and that is why I love it.  It is not a bar for the guy who wears his team jersey around town, but rather the guy who just wants to have a beer and watch a game after work with a colleague or a friend.

First of all it's a bahama themed restaurant for eating island favorites, tapas, and even drinking. I'm a big fan of their appetizers alone. During happy hour, all appetizers are half off so that's what my friends and I usually do. They also have a to-go menu for those on a tight schedule and wanna grab and go. 

This is to get an idea of their schedule:
Store Schedule // Sunday - Saturday: 11AM - 12AM
Happy Hour // Monday - Friday: 4PM - 6PM
Late Night Happy Hour // Sunday - Thursday: 9PM - 12AM

Happy Hour includes these appetizers to much on (and the portions are pretty big):
-Beef Empanadas
-Firecracker Shrimp
-Chicken Quesadilla
-Firecracker Shrimp Street Tacos 
-Pork Carnitas Street Tacos 
-Adobo Chicken Street Tacos 
-Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla 
-Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp 
-Coconut Shrimp
-Jumbo Lump Crab Stack 
-Warm Spinach Dip and Chips 
-Jamaican Chicken Wings Tostones with Chicken 
-Crispy Onion Rings 
-Habanero Chicken Wings

Most of the dishes are cooked in Kibae(butter with spices).
we enjoyed all these delicacies with a side of Ethiopian bread Injera,which is a crepe made from wheat flour.Also don't miss the Ethiopian Coffee.

The food & drinks, as to be expected, are ridiculously expensive, so i'd recommend either leaving the park for an hour to save $20+, or bring a lunch and leave it in the car in a very insulated cooler.  

The park itself felt clean, and the other park-goers seemed fine -- which if anyone knows can have a huge impact on your experience, i.e., Knott's Berry Farm.

The slides and water pool are okay.  Really this is where the park, in my opinion, comes up short.  There are a few really cool slides, but overall the park is lacking when compared to other parks.  The wave pool is cool for those wanting to take 1 big wave all the way in every 5 minutes or so, but, again, compared to other parks I prefer the pools with continuous, but smaller, waves.

It is also a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat.  You can be in and out pretty quickly when you need to be.  If you like sports, there always seems to be something on the TVs.  It has a sporty vibe, but it isn't shoved down your throat either.  It is a fun place to eat.

Having seen on Instagram and some friends' social media posts, I had to see it for myself and try it. The only challenge I had was finding the cafe in the first place. Without instagram and yelp, I would not have known to look for the big dark brown ancient looking door. Like probably most yelpers on here have said, they do not have any signs in front. Once I stepped inside, it was magical! It's definitely feels like you've just walked into a new world, like Narnia.  It's so different inside, very spacious and bright from their little greenhouse that houses their kitchen. Very unique cafe I have to say. The decorations are so cute and whimsical! They had a bookcase with stairs at the back where you can sit and read some books if you wanted and unique chairs and tables like the bird cage chair, that was one of my favorites. 

So, on my first time there, I definitely wanted to try their Lychee Rose cake. Unfortunately, I came at 12pm and they don't sell those desserts until 3pm.  So I ended up getting their Matcha Red Bean Bun and the Jujube Green Tea. The bun wasn't anything special, just a plain pastry with red bean filling. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but since the bun was flavorless (and no green tea flavor too), it balanced out. The drink was unique and refreshing to have on a very hot Vegas afternoon. The drink wasn't too sweet and I could definitely taste the green tea in there. The little jujubes were yummy to eat. 

On my second time here, I took my parents with me around 8pm hoping to get that Lychee Rose cake. Unfortunately again, I didn't. They had ran out. They ran out of most of their really yummy looking popular desserts actually. However, I managed to get a few which were their Tofu Cheesecake, Eclair, and Matcha Strawberry Cake. Out of the three, I liked the Tofu Cheesecake the best. You definitely did not taste any tofu in it. It was not overly sweet and very creamy! A good alternative and vegan option! The Matcha Strawberry cake was my least because it was so so so dry and there was not much flavor. The eclair was good though and had a lot of hazelnut filling inside. I also ordered a Matcha Ice Blend drink and I could definitely taste the matcha! Gabi Cafe does a great job with their teas from my two experiences there, but their desserts are hits and misses. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experiences at Gabi. The staff are friendly. The decorations and everything was very interesting and unique - something I wouldn't have imagine feeling and seeing before stepping inside. But, because of my dessert experiences and not being able to get the ones I wanted twice, I took a star away. I think a cafe like this shouldn't limit the desserts they make in a day, given how popular and in-demand some of them are.",2018-07-27 04:39:21

Instead of the typical soft bun, this sausage is served in a bun with a great chew, partly slotted so the sausage and toppings stay inside.

We ordered the appetizer sampler, pad thai ( #8 spiceness) & panang curry ( #3) 
To start off, the sampler is all fried and the breading or coating they use for the chicken wings were a weird texture. The best part of it was of course the cream cheese wontons. The Pad thai was a darker color than most places but was still tasty with the distinct sweetness to pad thai. As for the panang, for a #3 spiciness ( which I usually get when I eat thai food) was a bit spicier than most. Mainly dark meat and I'm wondering if white meat is an option there. We washed it all down with a large Thai Tea in a huge cup.

The menu items are a mix of Italian and seafood dishes. We started out with the Date Lollipops and the Cuttlefish appetizer for the table. The Date Lollipops were really good - a tasty combo of dates, bacon, and blue cheese. The cuttlefish appetizer was pretty good, reminded me of fried calamari, but a softer texture. 

For a main courses, we had the seared scallops, wreckfish, roasted prawns, and the maccheroni alla chitarra (a dish with salmon and pasta in a vodka sauce).

Positives:
The buffet menu is reasonably priced.
The location is excellent, in the ""restaurant row"" on King St W., close to theatres and concert venues. 
They have a food assortment of vegetarian and non-vegeratian dishes, some of them are quite good. 

Negatives: The space is crammed with tables, no space to move, no space to walk; there is only one foot or so between the buffet and the first row of tables. I was not seated at one of the tables next to the buffet, otherwise my review would have been 2 stars... 
The food is not the best, lamb is mostly bones, cheese (paneer) not creamy, naan not fresh, too much mayo in the coleslaw salad.
The staff not very friendly (or too busy), they don't refill dishes half an hour before the buffet closes (even if they take new guests). Nobody asked me if I want something from the bar. 
Only few options for cold starters and deserts. (I am comparing with Kama, which is not far away).
The restaurant looks like a foodcourt, a big room with lots of light and square tables. Not much Indian decor, no booths, no soft chairs. 
It is quite hard to find parking. If you find it will cost you at least $4/hour.

It tasted like a wet sponge which could have been salvaged had they prepped the toppings properly, but no, it was a pile of diced tomatoes with zero garlic or onion flavour - not even salt!  The cheese they put on top was also sad and tasteless.  C'mon now! I thought we were in Little Italy?!  Where's the damn pride?!

Well I don't know what the hell the rest of the menu is needed for to be honest.  I was on that side of town and decided to pick up dinner from KJ's and take it home with me.  I ordered two chicken and potato curries and one green bean curry. The hostess and I just naturally hit it off and had a pleasant conversation while I waited. I may have been the only other person in the place. We started talking about spice and I told her I adore spicy curry and we both gave each other this look, the ""are you serious when you speak about spice or are you faux-spice where even mild salsa sets your buds on fire?"" And the ""yes I like spicy like 12 chili spicy and yes I have rubbed my eyes mistakenly while cutting chilis at home trust me I know what I'm getting into and I want you to take me there"" wink that must have convinced her because she told my order to the cook in a language I am unfamiliar with and as soon as the sizzle hit the pan I could smell the spice in my nostrils and it gave the familiar zing of spicy ass food wafting in the air. Oh yes, they took me seriously....

And it was excellent. You take this food home and you pour the sauce sparingly so not doused on the rice (all of you complaining about saltiness doused it, I bet),  and you break some of the potato up, grab some of the chicken pieces, and use the sauce to congeal it with the rice into a nice little ball in your fingers and you push that into your mouth and proceed to moan with the goodness.  I mixed mine with the green bean curry because I crave veggie like no other. These dishes mix perfectly, you should try it. 

Spice level? The spice level was explosive, it was excellent, it had me pouring a tall glass of milk and taking turns with food and drink to keep the balance. Some people like to just sweat it out and have towels handy nearby.  

There was plenty for left overs. The next day for lunch I heated up some Kawan brand Paratha on the stovetop until crispy and flaky and perfect for tearing apart and dipping in the heavenly curry sauce that The Curry Bowl provided.

Now. On to the stone dol-sot-bibimbap. WOWZER. The thing was bigger than my head. It was the size of a med pizza, which I ate without guilt. Funny isn't it? I would feel so horrid if I ate the same amount in pizza but felt weirdly satisfied when I ate the equivalent in a bibimbap? It is something you MUST try. I loved it and crushed it.

One of the women, Kaylee actually yelled at me.  First off, the staff who took our orders were so rude and you could just tell they did not want to be there.  I didn't even want to ask what the taco Tuesday special was. Then, my friend has a shellfish allergy, so he asked if they could let the cooks know.  The guy comes back and says that they cannot do that because it will take an hour to clean.  So he refunded my friend.  We waited for about 50 minutes for my order, when I go up and check, I see they made my friends order.  I told one of the cooks that they already refunded us, and he told me to just take it.  
Kaylee comes over and I ask her if my order was missing.  She asks me for my ticket, but they gave a pager.  She asks about the other food on the table and then proceeded to yell at me saying that she was calling out that shellfish allergy order for awhile.  I tried to explain that we weren't listening because it was refunded and we didn't think they would make it.  She tells me that she told  the cashier guy they could accommodate the shellfish order. Okay? Well, I'm still waiting on my order, we aren't stealing $1.50 tacos.   She goes and checks with the people at the register to see if we were lying I guess? 
Then to top that abuse off, she tells me they lost my ticket.  After she realises that we weren't lying she starts to be nice.  I just got my refund and left.  I didn't go out to eat to have the staff treat me like garbage.  I am sick to my stomach.",2017-06-07 05:47:15

I had to run here (literally), my belly full of pork schnitzel (not joking), blood spewing from my nose (again, I don't lie much), just to quickly snatch an Almond Croissant before they closed. Was it worth it? Is that even a question? 

For me the only obvious comparison was Gaby et Jules, since I haven't been to Jean-Marc yet. They differ greatly. If Gaby is a piece of marble, then Gourmi is a brick. Not a bad thing, just way different, less polished. With comfort food instead of edible art (albeit art that is incredibly fine-tasting). La Gourmandine is soft and calm and specializes in similarly designed bread based pastries. So I don't know what else and how else to say other than this: the Almond Croissant is absolutely stunning. It was a thing of dreams. Dreams that take place in the hearts of Frenchmen and Lawrencevillians alike. 

Buuut, (here it comes; it wasn't quite perfect) the La Gourmandine people seemed slightly grumpy, especially when compared to the shine-your-shoes-just-for-buying-a-macaron grade of service at Gaby et Jules. And speaking of which, La Gourmandine's were far from perfect. Too crunchy and sugary; better stick with the the croissants. So I still like Gaby a bit better. (I'm sorry, ok!) Really, Gaby and Gourmi together is less of a comparison and more of a conclusion. Between the two, they have everything you might ever want.

If you are a fan of European Style baked goods, you are going to love this place. The most popular item on their menu is their famous Pastizzi's (cheese filled pastries baked to perfection).

This is their signature dish, and they bake thousands of them weekly. They taste best when they are fresh out of the oven. If you take them home, just re-heat them in your oven for 5 minutes or give them 15 seconds in the microwave

The decor is what I expected.  Super hip with a floor to ceiling windows that gave us a great view of CityScape from our table.  
The menu is very intriguing with items such as fried quail, cheddar scallion biscuits, and Kobe beef short ribs.  All of those items were fairly tasty as well.  The short ribs were a little difficult to eat and I think they were cooked a little too long.  
The service needs work.  We wanted to get a bottle of wine and asked our server for a recommendation.  I understand he was no sommelier, but figured he'd have some knowledge on their offerings.  I let him know my tastes and said I normally get chardonnay, but would like to try something new and would like to hear what he recommended.  He said if we like chardonnay, get chardonnay.  Mmmmmmmkay.  So much for trying something new.  I am allergic to eggs and asked him if the fried quail was dipped in an egg wash before frying.  He replied by saying he had no idea things were dipped in egg before frying and that he learned something new.  I like to go to restaurants to try new things and trust the servers know more about the menu than I do and can assist me in finding the right options.  I got the impression that servers here are just order takers and food runners.  I recommend a little training on the menu items for the servers.  
This was my second time at Blue Hound.  The first time we sat at a table in the lounge area for 10 minutes and was never addressed so left.

Since that salad was pretty much the highlight of my week, I want to add my 2 cents here.  

First of all, the components of the salad are listed right on the menu, so if you don't like what's in it, don't order it.  If you like beets, squash, grains, etc., this salad is absolutely the perfect combination of crunchy, hearty, healthy, salty, and a little sweet.  So incredible was this salad that I couldn't even stop eating in time to leave room for ice cream at Churn.  I was very impressed with the vast array of options on the menu here but will probably continue to order the mixed grain salad again and again.

Other stuff about Windsor:

The patio is delightful.  It's not a particularly large patio but it's got a great setup, with plenty of room between tables.  Thank goodness for misters.

Sourdough Waffles with fresh banana, maple syrup and Tahitian vanilla bean butter 11.50- this was my dish and it was the BEST waffles I have ever had in my life.  They were light, crisp, and perfect.  The vanilla bean butter, banana, and pecans took it to another level.

Croque Madame- Toasted ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg and mornay sauce.  Served w pommes frites.  16.95 - I tried some of my friend's croque madame and it was RIDICULOUSLY tasty.  Think Moons over my hammy at Denny's.  It's 10 million times better.

Vegetable plate my buttinsky--there's pork in that there dish.  Yep, my wife ordered their plate with four vegetables and two of them were loaded with pork.

About the best you can do at a place like Cracker Barrel (if you want to do more than graze on salad) is to resort to Starchitarianism.  In that case, either order sides or get something like their French Toast plate with the meat on the side to take home to the dog.  It's really good tasting and will fill you up for a nice price.

First of all, why in the blue hell are there so many employees just standing around here b.s.'ing with each other? There were literally more employees than customers here....by far. Actually, it wasn't even close. Reminded me of Fry's Electronics, except with a lot less stock. I wandered around the store a bit but couldn't find what I was looking for. I came across several employees that saw me and would look away or keep walking. Nice. So I approached a gaggle of them (like 5 or 6) just standing around chit chatting. After a couple of awkward seconds where I couldn't get one of them to even make eye contact with me, one of them finally said, ""Can I help you with something?"" 

Amen.

Sheesh. Finally, signs of life. I asked where I might find the item. 

Guess what?

The don't carry it. Okay. How do you not carry an antenna for a modem? I thought you were Best friggin' Buy??

Fine. Do you know where I can find one at nearby?

Guess where he tells me?

""Try Home Depot or Walmart.""

Are you kidding me? Home Depot??

Both Walmart and Home Depot are right there, so I decided to check it out, against my better judgement. Who knows? Maybe they DO have it...

Guess what?

They don't.


I ended up having to go to Fry's Electronics to get the item. I am not a huge fan of Fry's, but after this trip to Best Buy I see that it can be worse.

From what I saw tonight, I'd be shocked if this place was still in business this time next year. It really needs to go the way of Circuit City and Ultimate Electronics. 

With ""service"" like that I will never step foot in this place again.

We had heard so much about the ""popovers"" but when they arrived an hour into our meal, after requesting them four times, the outside was burnt. Talk about disappointment. 
I ordered the beet salad. It arrived drowning in dressing that overpowered any other flavors that once existed in this salad turned soup. Blah. 
I ordered the sole as my entree. Way overpriced, and far too much salt. Clearly you should stick with the steaks. The side of carrots were pleasing and the Prisoner red wine is always a sure thing at any restaurant.

It was not assembled like a traditional 'tart'.  There were two pieces of puff pastry that sandwiched brie and cream and what tasted to be onions and cabbage.  There wasn't a lot of leek at all for this tart (unless our taste buds were mistakened).  The only leek we saw were the ones sprinkled on top of the tart and around the plate.

Either way, I really liked this leek tart especially near the end when I got a big chunk of brie cheese in my mouth.  Yum!  Brie cheese is love.

My Atlantic Salmon main dish came with green lentils, roasted winter squash, and lemon & white wine butter sauce.  The narrow piece of salmon sat on top of a gigantic pile of mostly green lentils and squash pieces.  I didn't realize that there were going to be so many lentils.  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with this dish.  The piece of salmon was quite firm and dry.  There needed to be some more sauce to the dish.  The combination of green lentils and squash in the butter sauce did taste quite good at the beginning.  Once the dish started to get cold though, the sauce was barely detectable and the overall dish was just so-so.  More sauce and juicy salmon, please!

The Lobster Mac & Cheese had Atlantic lobster, cheddar, sweet peas, cheese curds, and Goldfish crumb in it.  When it arrived, it was a huge plate of pure lobster mac and cheese!  I really liked the creaminess and cheesiness of the dish.  The chunks of lobster that were present were quite good and meaty.  However, we both thought that there wasn't enough of it in the dish.

The diner feel to this (mostly) ice cream shop is palpable, and the decor and style is nostalgic. Pink is definitely the theme here, down to the trademark pink napkins and menus. Service is friendly and efficient, and the check is paid in a no-hassle fashion by going up to the cashier window at the end. 

It's a solid ice cream place, but I mostly come here for the feel more than for the fare. I haven't tried any of the savory or hot dishes, so this review is for the ice cream only. I like that Sugar Bowl offers a variety of ice cream scoops, sundaes, and banana splits. 

Ice cream scoops:
I've tried the strawberry and Rocky Road here. I like that the strawberry had a tart bite instead of being all sweet, but the Rocky Road was pretty sweet. The chopped almonds added a nice crunch, but unfortunately the nuts themselves were a little stale.

Buster Brownie sundae:
My friend raved about this sundae, so when he ordered it, I of course had to try some. The brownie and vanilla ice cream were fine, nothing special, but the marshmallow fluff was pretty good. It was pillowy soft and sweet. If I had ordered this sundae, I would've gotten it with coffee ice cream to better balance out the sweetness of the brownie and marshmallow fluff. I also thought the whipped cream on top was overkill with the marshmallow, as it was sweet on top of sweet on top of sweet. 

Rocky Mountain sundae:
I liked the coffee ice cream in this sundae, and I thought though it was one of the sweeter coffee ice creams I've had, the robust coffee flavor came through nicely. The chocolate syrup was too much, and the ice cream was just swimming in syrup by the third bite. 

Creamed walnut fudge sundae:
Meh, this sundae was probably my least favorite out of the three I tried, although that could have been because my friend substituted the vanilla ice cream for chocolate. This resulted in sweetness overload and pretty one-dimensional flavor. 

Price are reasonable, and substitutions for different kinds of ice cream in the sundaes come free of charge (which I really appreciate).",2018-02-24 07:29:27

VIBE 
It's really exciting to see another pop up success story! I think Rock Lobster perfectly fits the atmosphere of Ossington in Watusi's old space and will bring the hipsters and foodies in droves. The murals are ""instagram"" worthy decorated by owner Matt Petit himself and the seating works as a place where you can chill out. 

That said, the music is LOUD. Like Rock N' Roll, Bruce Springsteen loud so sometimes you can't hear your campanion. 
Service is A Plus -- even when it's busy everyone from the owner to the waitstaff are making sure you're taken care of. 

WE ATE 
I was lucky to be at a media event and get a sampling of everything. The lobster rolls here are classic but the additions are also really exciting (and no, it's not all lobster!). 
I loved the seafood platter with oysters, shrimp and lobster--it gets a bit messy but it's fun. The flank steak with hickory sticks and egg added with sailor jerry rum sauce was a big hit with our table as well and gives a more casual vibe to the whole ""surf and turf mentality."" It was nice to see something healthy on the menu as well like the beet salad and that gave the meal a bit of balance as well. The Cripsy Maple Pork belly with creamed spinach and micro greens was YUM! Nicely executed and presented. 

Misses: the lobster poutine - I like my cheese more gooey and less curdy; the Caesar salad; the rolls are great but a bit mayo heavy --the pickle really cuts through that though (and the pickles are BIG so that's a hit not a miss!). I'm not as much of a fan of the whale tail either --I like the Canadiana effort but it would be cool to see a more inventive dessert that's easy to eat (kind of like Grand Electric's key lime vassos) but doesn't break the bank (like under the $5-6 mark). 

DRINK: Rock Lobster has teamed up with Sailor Jerry spiced rum to deliver some kick a** drinks by superstar bartender Josh Lindley. Though I didn't have it, his caesar with a lobster tail seems to have everyone talking; My favourite drink was the Norman Collins -- Sailor Jerry with lime juice and elderflower. It's simple and packs a punch. If you're a fan of campari, you'll like the Barel Aged Flying Colours drink: rum with campari, cherry heering and peychaud bitters aged in a tequila barrel for 30 days. If you're not a fan of campari, you'll take one sip and move on to the Norman Collins. It's a VERY strong drink!

So, finally made the time to go for lunch today.  The reason the line is out the door is because you order at the counter just inside the door.  While we waited, someone found a table for us and put our number on it, so as soon as we ordered, we sat down.

The menu is intimidating for someone who isn't a huge organic/sustainable/locavore/glutenfree/healthfood person, but I ordered a wrap - The Rebel - this is a grass fed steak wrap, and I will say it was the best wrap I have ever tried.

Interesting crowd - it looked to be about 80% young females in the 15-35 age range - based on this observation, if I ever want to target that crowd for a business, I'm going to make sure to feature 'organic' and 'sustainable' and 'free range' and etc. on my advertising!

I had been searching for an Indian buffet nearby  thank you to whomever added Angara as a business for ending my search.

Angara is on Grand Canyon behind McDonalds, next door to Tropical Smooth and two doors from Bite. 

Buffets is available only during lunch and is only $10.99/person. If you have never had Indian food, this is a very good deal and allows you to try all the popular Indian dishes. In fact, I recommend trying a little bit of everything. The staff at Angara is very helpful. If you wanna know about a dish, they are more than happy to answer your questions.

As you are seated, you are offered two types of naan, plain or garlic. I chose plain as I had to return to the office, and I wanted to be sure I could taste the flavors of the other dishes.

At the beginning of the buffet, they have large sized samosas (my all time favorite, Indian pastry filled with potatoes and peas),  followed by the vegetarian entrees like Saan paneer (my all time favorite Indian vegetarian dish, creamy spinach with cheese cubes),  lentil and eggplant dishes. I'm not a hot/spicy dish person. In the past, I have known saan paneer as a mild dish, but Angara makes it spicy that I had to eat it with the naan instead of the rice. 

Unfortunately, because I filled up on the samosa, vegetarian dishes, rice and naan, the only meat dish I could get to was the chicken tikka. Proof that one can get very full on vegetarian dishes alone. Next time, I'll have to start with the meats. Other meat dishes available were chicken tandoori and goat curry. One dish I wish they had is fried fish bites.

At the end of the buffet were desserts that I'm unfamiliar with, but will try in a future visit, and  regular house salad which baffles me with all the vegetarian dishes available, but to each his/her own.",2015-10-24 22:21:28

Since moving from North Las Vegas last year, I have been to Green Valley Ranch countless times. I really enjoy coming here for just about everything....but to gamble! lol I have friends and co-workers that say they hit here left and right, but with the exception of one glorious 4 Aces hand, I have yet to really hit squat! So I usually save my gambling for South Point since I've actually won over there. But I digress..

They have a pretty good little food court there with a Capriottis(Yum!), Fatburger, and Panda Express(Love me some Panda!), Villa Pizza(see seperate review), and a few others...

I ate at the Buffet about 1 1/2 years ago, so I don't think it would be fair to do a review at this point. But I remember it being good, but not spectacular. Very much similar to both Aliante and Red Rock Buffets, both Station properties. (Although recently Aliante was sold and is no longer a Station property...but again, I digress..)

They have a Regal movie theater downstairs, which I go to quite frequently. Gotta love those $6 Tuesdays!

One of the best things about GVR though is that it is always very clean (restrooms included) . Even though I noticed others complaining about smoke smell, I am a non smoker and I just dont get that. Than again I work in a casino, so maybe I'm a bit de-sensatized, but I've never felt a strong smoke oder like I do at say, a Terribles Casino or the like...

I did try the cafe once and was underwhelmed, but will give it another chance one day(see seperate review)..

but one of my co-workers swears by Hanks! I swear I will try this sometime in the near future! I have heard too many great things about this steakhouse to not give it a shot!

Their race and sports book is pretty much a standard Stations book, crappy lines but a lot of space, comfortable seating, and multiple screens..so you could do a lot worse there..

all in all, I really like GVR, so long as I don't feel like gambling..lol..go figure

Since it would be a shorter drive than to Pho Metro, we decided to give it a try, hoping that it would be good enough to be our go to Pho spot in Durham region.  

We each ordered an extra large house special Pho and a large satay beef Pho only because they don't offer a medium size.  We had a good chuckle thinking about why a restaurant would have a small, large and an extra large sizes instead of just simply having a small, medium and large.  Doesn't seem to make much sense to skip a medium and call it a large and their large, an extra large.  Anyways, I digress.

The noodles arrived fairly quickly and they were the broader and less chewy variety that I don't particularly enjoy.  My husbands extra large house special pho had some meatballs (upon partaking later, they were overcooked and chewy) and some cooked rare beef (which were also pretty tough).  Not the best cuts of meat were used and the meat portion was on a small side.  The broth was the standard out of package msg stuff that tasted like most pho broth.

My satay beef pho was the strangest version of the dish I had ever encountered at a pho restaurant.  The soup was thick and gooey from the large chunks of beef that had been coated in corn starch before being wok fried and added to the soup.  There was not enough satay sauce to really taste the satay but the gooey and goopy consistency of the broth was the most off putting thing about the noodle soup.  Overall, the noodle soup didn't taste bad, just poorly executed.  

I'm not sure if we would go back to pho mono or just choose to do the extra 10 min drive up to Pho Metro.  The jury is still out.",2016-05-08 16:34:13

I'd heard about how crowded Destihl gets around dinnertime, and never having been there before, I went the AARP-route and reserved a table for us at 5:15 to give ample time for slow service (this was unnecessary).  I was surprised to learn that Destihl is cavernous.  There was absolutely no shortage of tables.  How does it ever get crowded?  Who knows?  In any case, we were (irritatingly) seated near the only large, loud party in the entire restaurant.  Nothing like listening to a bunch of screechy teenagers dressed up for Homecoming say semi-racist things and then shush each other on date night!

We got appetizers and small plate-y things to constitute our meal.  All were finger food, all were messy and delicious.  We tried the cheese curds (lightly breaded, crunchy, thoroughly melty), thai chicken wings (a nicely spicy slow burn, flavorful, thick sauced with fabulous peanuts sprinkled over the top), and beer-boiled shrimp (a tad too much seasoning that clung to our fingers and overwhelmed most other flavors, not much beer taste, but otherwise...you know...cold shrimp are tasty on their own).  I tried a pint of their black IPA which I thoroughly enjoyed.  

We also shared their chocolate trio (or Ménage à Trois or whatever they call it), which consisted of mexican hot chocolate (thick, hot, nom), a chocolate tart (delicious filling, but with a crust that was absolutely impossible to cut into, making it awkward to eat, much less share), and zanzibar chocolate ice cream (heaven).  

I need to try more things to be sure that this is actually a problem, but I feel like everything on their menu is too complicated.  There are SO MANY INGREDIENTS listed on every single menu item.  Too many seasonings, too many flavor combinations.  Every time I read something, I was like, ""Mmm...yes...yes...yes!...oh, no, you went too far.""

Our waiter was extremely enthusiastically friendly to the point of making us feel a bit awkward.  I mean, he hung out and chatted.  I don't harbor ill will against the guy or anything--he was really nice!--but you know...I'm on a date with my main squeeze...please leave.

I ordered pineapple curry with chicken, level 6. It was waiting for me after 20 minutes. I will say, the dining room was packed and very loud, I could barely hear the cashier tell me my total.

The waiter said that on Saturday they were going to reopen as Al's Garage. The Mexican food wasn't selling. So tonight we returned on opening night, braving the crowds and noise.

Our waitress, Taylor, was terrific - friendly, attentive, and efficient. 

I wasn't blown away by the wine choices - all too dry for my limited palate, but Taylor provided a taste of the Chardonnay; it was okay, so I went with it. It was a very large pour and definitely one of the better Chardonnays I've been forced to imbibe. Taylor told me that next time I can get one of the ones that John Cutter offers (just steps away, same owner), and I had a wonderful Riesling there. Good to know.

My husband ordered the chicken sandwich and I had the shrimp brochette. His sandwich, on a grilled focaccia-type roll, was a sight to behold - big, photo-worthy, and served with a hearty portion of homemade seasoned chips. The chicken was layered with an ample amount of marinated kale. My shrimp was a big disappointment. Five crustaceans sat atop a salad of - drumroll - mostly kale. The restaurant needs to be renamed Al's Kale Garage, because it's everywhere. I'm not a huge fan of the green, but can take it in small doses if it's chopped up and marinated well. I did ask for a limited amount of dressing, as I always do for a salad, but didn't expect that every bite would be a chore because of all the kale. The shrimp were so hard to get off the skewer that the first sent waves of greased kale all over my cellphone, and the second broke the skewer. I gave up. Fortunately for me, hubby's sandwich was large enough that he gave me the second half and took the rest of my salad. The strange twist is that his man-sized sandwich was a lower price than my diet-sized entree.

The music was great, and the thundering crowd made it hard to determine if the noise level was attributable to opening night, or is the way it's to be. The owner, Adam, came over and introduced himself, which was appreciated. After I commented that the space occupied by all the empty lounge chairs and tables would be better off being replaced by more pub tables, he said that they'd be filled when there are games on TV. Maybe so, but all the pub tables were filled when we came and when we left. I guess it won't always be that way.

I'm giving Al's Garage four stars, because of the fabulous chicken sandwich, the wonderful service and music, and because opening night may not be the true test. I'm hoping that some of that kale will find a new home.",2018-08-05 05:08:02

I have been there 6 different times now and have never walked out thinking the meal I just had was nothing but, at the minimum, a solid experience. It's a well-run restaurant.

I always order the Caprese pizza because I cannot resist the combination of ingredients. It tastes great and as everyone else says the crust is amazing but I do feel like sometimes the middle part of the pizza becomes soggy and a bit mushy. This might often be the case when using cherry tomatoes and I am not sure if there's a way around it? 

The prices are a bit high but what you get in return is a level of freshness rarely found in other restaurants in the city so at least, you know the prices are not totally unfair. They do not skimp on quality. Besides, it's hard to argue their prices are too high since the place is almost always jam packed for dinners, especially late in the week.

Service has always been very good despite how busy they are. The waiters are friendly, knowledgeable and professional.

The prices were definitely on the higher side, possibly more expensive than downtown. Ordered three baos and the taro chips. Sad to say, everything was disappointing. Was expecting a warm, soft and light bun but instead the bao was wrapped in a checkered parchment paper, which made the bao kind of soggy.

The only good thing was the pork belly, it was a full slice of fatty pork. The other baos only had a bit of meat and was covered in sauce. The slaw on top for all three was the same, some cabbage, carrots, radish and cilantro. It was all wrapped up tightly in paper so it was a messy eat to unwrap.

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

That was pretty much the reaction of all the people that happened to drop in last night (Tuesday around 10pm) at Blue Martini. The music was still blasting out of the speakers, the bouncer is still checking IDs, but there was at most 20 people including the staff inside.  That is just cra-cra from a business operations perspective.

Not sure what happened to this place.  But even in the middle of the week on ""industry nights"" Blue Martini was a pretty happening place a few years ago.  I am not a regular but from the pictures shared on FB and other social media, it was a fantastic place to hangout with friends and meet new ones.  But now, we walk in after celebrating a coworker's birthday downstairs at another restaurant and the place was like, reserved for VIPs that have yet to arrive.  It felt like walking into that habitually closed and then opened briefly under new management strip club on W. Sahara. The place is big, but how can you stay open when the staff to patrons ratio is almost 1:3 (and I am counting the hostess and bouncer at the front and the bathroom attendant(s).

Anyway, I hope they do better on other more busy nights. Because even with the discounted appetizers and drink specials, without a happening crowd to fill all the squared footage that Blue Martini occupies, they will soon go the way of the prior neighbor Cadillac Ranch.

The sausage was a little sweet and boring and the potatoes were not really browned so they lacked some crispiness I was expecting. Overall the food was good, but I'd like to see them kick it up with an exceptional meat and crispy spuds.

It was a warm day and it was HOT inside the resto. They could have had a few fans to move the air around. The resto has a vintage coffee house feel, but also feels a bit grubby and worn.

For what this place is (a Cheapy Chinee Buffet) it fits the bill.  Nothing served here is all that impressive, but at least for the most part the place is clean.  The pricing doesn't impress me that much either, there are other Chinee buffets around town for the same price or cheaper that have the same type of food at the same quality.  I swear, you go here do not expect Cathay House type food!  Totally different!

All the usual suspects are here at this Krazy Buffet:

Fried Rice, Chow Mein, Beef & Broccoli, Sweet & Sour Pork, Orange Chicken (which by the way Panda Express does it better haha), Egg Rolls, Egg Fu Young, Mongolian Beef, various types of faux-shi (fake 'California' roll type sushi), Won Ton soup, and Hot & Sour soup.  Quite a number of dishes.  You also have the option of a Mongolian Bar included in the price where you can pick your veggies and raw meat from the serving line and have the chef du jour (in my case a young Mexican kid named Pablito..or was it Jose?) cook them for you in a teppanyaki manner.  

For the American crowd there is the added Fried Chicken Wings (the MSG added on the ones at Buffet @ Asia make them sooooo much tastier), French Fries and pizza for the kids too.  What is it about pizza at a Chinee buffet that makes it somehow good?  Must be the cheese?  Or is some secret MSG sprinkled on top for good measure?  Hmmm....

There's a decent looking salad bar but the dessert bar is a little lacking.  Come on, I love me some mini chocolate and powdered donuts... but how Chinee is that?  And of course there is the chocolate and vanilla soft serve machine.  

Food is ok, tasty if you're hungry and on a dime budget.  It will fill you up but somehow leave you feeling empty.  Then 2 hours later you are hungry again!  I'm an Asian boy (yes, part Chinee) so I'm not trying to be racist.  This is no joke for me.  Seriously.  I ate my fill here, left feeling a lil' bit queezy.  Then a few hours later I'm hungry again!  

Of course dinner may be better but I don't know.  I'm way too cheap of a Chinee at the moment to pay $12 per person for dinner.  I feel that the options for me are better for dinner at another buffet of the same type, although I will not mention names.  But I think I might have already earlier in my review.  My bad!  

Krazy Buffet is a good option for those of you on a tiny budget, but don't have a weak stomach!  Don't go here if you've got a sensitive tummy.  I know the place touts that they don't use MSG but man is some of their food a bit on the salty side!  So be sure to get an extra glass of water in to wash it down.

Some guy is filming it.  OK.  On his phone.  Strange.  Bartender has an awkward expression, sort of like one might have if one's clergyman gave him a sex toy for his birthday.  A few local customers are crushed up against the wall as if someone on stage was releasing cooties into the air.  All of it just so strange.

So what do you do?  I say sit your butt down, buy the nice guy in a japanese dress a drink and enjoy the show!  Pretty soon you're doing shots, dancing like an idiot and stumbling out into the street hoping you didn't give anyone your real phone number!

The guy behind the counter greeted me soon after I approached the counter. He made some recommendations based on some new products they just started carrying. I initially took one of his recommendations, but had to go back to my original plan when I saw that it had a fruit I may be allergic to in it.

The bottled juices are lined up nicely in the display so that you can easily read the ingredients. Each juice has a cute name like Bee Excellent or Bee Magnificent. The combinations are really interesting and combine fruits, vegetables, and spices. The bottled juices come in nice 16 oz. glass bottles. Now that I've disposed of my bottles I see that they give a $1 credit for every clean bottle returned. :) I'll definitely have to remember that for next time. In addition to bottled juices this location also offers smoothies, nut milks, and cocktails. 

The company website is really great. I didn't check it out until after my purchase, but will definitely check it out before my next visit to make sure I'm getting the right juice for what I need. All of the juices and smoothies are listed with not only ingredients, but with the benefits of each product. For example, Bee True To You is good for immunity boosting and allergy relief. 

Both of my juices were very good. Bee Grateful had carrot, pineapple juice, apple, ginger, and lemon. This juice was on the sweeter side, but had a great flavor. Bee Resilient was the real test of their ability to make great juice and they passed with flying colors. This juice had spinach, romaine, cucumber, kale, parsley, microgreens, lemon, and ginger. It was so good! I loved all of the nutrients I was getting and it was a tasty way to get my nutrients. Both juices had a smooth consistency without seeds or pieces of fruits or vegetables.

I didn't look at pricing before purchasing so I had some sticker shock as I signed the receipt for the two juices. After trying the product and reading the information on their website I do think it's worth the money. I'll definitely be back since I loved the juices and the nutritional content.",2016-06-13 03:03:48

The wings is a must try though... the meat falls right over the chicken bones and it is soo tender! However, with that said, it was too salty for me to be able to eat 8 whole wings.

BEER - Being a brewery this should matter most here, and we give the beer a 2.5 out of 5. Very disappointing beers for a new craft brewery, little character and no depth to the beers. There is a very big choice for a small brewery, but none are outstanding. Craft breweries usually either experiment or do traditional beers very well, this place though does traditional styles not so well. 

The beers taste watered down. When we asked the waitress what their blonde tasted like, she said, ""like a Budweiser"". We thought, okay, so a craft quality kind of Budweiser - but no, it really tastes like good ole Bud.

And while it's worth trying all their different beers, their flight of five beers for six dollars is way overpriced, since each beer sample you get is only a tiny splash. That may be what I was most offended by.

FOOD - 4.5 out of 5. My husband and I got the brewmaster BBQ and the porterhouse tail open face. Each was very tasty and at 9 and 11 dollars respectively, we thought it was fairly priced compared with similar burgers / sandwiches of lesser quality at other places.

I arrived on a Wednesday night and checked out on Friday morning.  The first thing we noticed was the maze you have to go through to get to the self parking.  We parked on the 4th floor and had to walk through the mall to get to the hotel.  How ass backwards is that?  The next day I noticed people going in and out of the door to the right of the front desk.  I inquired with the concierge and he let me know that it leads to the ""smoking area.""  I said, ""Does it connect to the parking structure?""  He replied, ""Yes.""  Why are there NO SIGNS when entering the hotel, or even IN the hotel, that the 3rd floor gets you straight into the lobby?  Ridiculous.  So we parked there from then on.  This make checking out MUCH more easier than trying to get to check-in.  Note to PH Towers, please place more signs for your guests.  

The hotel itself was nice.  What I wasn't too keen on, was the black toilet.  I'm a gerb phobe and not being able to see how ""clean"" the seat was, was a little unnerving.

The window covering is operated by a switch near the tv, which allows you to open or close the shade.  The bed had lights on the sides and on the headboard.  I really liked that.  I read another yelper saying there was no in-room dining menu in the room, however ours was on the coffee table.  There were no other books though. 

There is no ""Do Not Disturb"" sign, it's all electronic.  There are some buttons by the door and you push ""Service room"" or ""please do not disturb"" or ""anything, anytime.""  Pretty cool!  

One complaint I had was that there is no ice machine on the floor.  Infact, when I called to find out where it was (as there is an ice container in the room), front desk told me it is on the 5th floor.  Ok, so you want me to go down to the lobby, and to the other elevator to go up to the 5th floor, go back down to the lobby, and go back to my elevator to get to the 19th floor, all for a bucket of ice?!  You've got to be kidding me.  This was probably the most ridiculous thing about the hotel other than the initial parking situation, which was resolved after I did some inquiring.  

Room service was okay.  The lady who brought my breakfast was very friendly, nice and plain awesome.  However, the food, not so much.  I was a little disappointed in the food, and barely made a dent in it.  I ate just enough so I wouldn't be starving.  However, room service was fast and there was a lot of food for what I paid for, compared to other hotels.  (I like to try room service once at each hotel I stay at.)   

My last night there I was woken up several times between 1:00 and 1:30am.  So I finally called down to the front desk to make a noise complaint and in no time, security was sent up and things quieted down.  I understand it's Vegas, and some of you want to just party and get stupid, which is fine.  But please be considerate of other people who actually want to get some sleep at 1am. :)

Overall, this hotel gets a 3.5, and 4 for the room.  

I would stay here again, for sure and recommend others to try it out as well.",2011-10-28 20:12:10

Since changing over from Red's we had some not-so-great dinners but now they've worked out the kinks. We had a great dinner here on the weekend. Prices are moderate for this quality of food and atmosphere, and the free valet parking is convenient! I had halibut and my bride the wood fire roasted chicken. Both were fine examples of how to do it right! Local ingredients are used wherever possible. It gets five stars because it has hit its target - a really good, moderately priced and casual Arizona restaurant. This is what Scottsdale used to be, and what Litchfield Park is now. It is a fine addition to the neighborhood! The only negative: we do miss the raspberry cheesecake tower the Red's used to offer for dessert.",2012-11-07 03:35:51
kSTEGiCZWRENL4uisgUzrw,PBV_oQCoABX958-zjiLGwQ,Mrqk1ydkvgKtlxrExCv6gQ,4,3,0,0,"Saturday 12:15pm lunch time we dined as a group of 4 adults, 1 toddler, and 1 child. No longer a Scarborough native, I had only ever shopped at the seafood market years ago and didn't realize Diana's had opened a restaurant next door. (Everybody in my lunch party had been to the restaurant except me). The restaurant was not understaffed which is a plus because that means you don't have trouble getting service attention, and they were incredibly patient with the fact that we had a toddler with us, and one who was nearing his terrible 2s. I don't recommend this seafood restaurant as being child-friendly becuase 1)acoustics are loud if a child screams [we tested this] 2)no kids menu, and 3)most children don't like seafood until they are a little older.

The waitress was familiar with our party so the service and conversation were very natural and sincere. I was delighted to read that the menu wasn't overly ambitious, ensuring I wasn't about to experience a Franken-seafood restaurant: There were calamari, octopus, oysters in appetizers, bouillabaise, lobster, and fish in mains, pastas had 1 chicken option for the non-seafood customer, and desserts had an interesting ""cardomom creme caramel"" which I did not take the opportunity to try this visit. Just reading the combinations of food gave me the impression the chef here is very lucky to be entrusted with more creative liberty than other restaurants given the mediocre menus I've seen across town this past winter and spring (if I see another ""pickled beet salad""...I think I will have a meltdown).  

We asked for our starters and mains to come out simultaneously to skip on formalities so we can immediately tuck in. There is a long wine and beer list for pairing with your food. We ordered a variety of oysters on ice, 1/2 dozen each. Oyster tastes are a personal preference, but they were freshly shucked and came with generous wedges of fresh lemon slices and freshly grated horseradish. I enjoyed their Kumamoto, French Kiss, and LARGE cherrystone clams. These were also served with baskets of ovenfresh hot bread, butter, oil&vinegar. 
  
The grilled octopus was served on a bed of warm arugula salad with couscous and hummus. The hummus was more like a sauce for plating and that was very novel in comparison to ho-hum hummus. The fact that I found pomegranate seeds in the arugula continued to verify my guess that their kitchen is allowed to be creative, or at least, to invest in a spectrum of produce.

The bouillabaise was a generous seafood stew. It contained clams, mussels, fish, scallop, shrimp (I think?) and a lobster tail. The star of the dish was definitely the soup because it was a thick and flavourful fennel and tomato base.  I am not even a tomato soup lover, but I like this one! I personally like the slight licorice taste of fennel, but I didn't notice it in this stew. The lobster tail wasn't particularly special--just frozen lobster. The mussels tasted off, and it was consistently ALL the mussels, so I was surprised and disappointed. The clams were incredibly large, and the fish was meaty and not flaky, something I really enjoy.  I think the menu said the bouillabaisse came with rouille, but I don't recall if I had it or noticed it in the bouillabaisse. (Perhaps it's that mayo-Thousand-Island-looking spread on the garlic bread in the photo I attached). I didn't seek out the rouille, so I guess I can't recollect it!

Overall, I enjoyed the bold creativity of their dishes, the waitstaff service, the freshness and variety of available raw shellfish, and the plating and presentation of everything we ordered.",2014-06-30 03:16:25

Our favorites: beef bulgogi, spicy pork, enoki bacon.
The flat iron garlic was good, meat was very tender but lack in flavor. They do give you 3 dipping sauces for your meats. 
We also got the Korean marinated short rib. Flavor is similar to the beef bulgogi, meat was tender. 
For the price difference I would just stick with beef bulgogi at $3.95 instead of the other two mentioned above that cost $8.95. 
Sides included: cucumber, Kim chi, sweet onion/daikon, weird spicy noodle dish (not our fave), Mac and cheese salad.
Husband ordered the steamed egg, it looks really big but not as fluffy and airy like the one from Tofu Hut. 
I ordered the house salad. I liked the variety of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes, Lao came with an egg cut in half. The dressing sauce had a hint of orange citrus flavor, yummy. 
Service was decent. They switched the grill out as soon as it was black.

I went here once out of curiosity, and then the other 4 or 5 (yes really, that many) times I have been because that's where everyone else already was and we got invited.  Let me remind you, I hate Jimmy Buffett music.  It's so annoying!

Aside from the fact that I am inundated with music that I can't stand, and usually it's the same three songs over and over, the food here is not bad.  I usually get the coconut shrimp because they are always crispy and they actually taste like there is some coconut on them, unlike most places that like to overcharge you for ""coconut"" shrimp.  It also comes with a really yummy marmalade dipping sauce.  I actually love their peel and eat shrimp though.  I think they are boiled in beer or something, and they come in a big giant clam dish filled with ice.  Kind of weird, but it makes me laugh.  The shrimp themselves are really yummy, tasting exactly like peel and eat shrimp should.  The cocktail sauce they serve with it is a really nice pairing to the shrimp.  It's moderately spicy so it doesn't kill my tastebuds before I am finished eating.

The service here is usually lacking.  Well, I take that back, it's always lacking.  You have to track someone down to get refills.  Aside from that, I have never found any of my servers to be particularly personable there.  Maybe it's because they hate Jimmy Buffett music too and they are miserable because they work there.  Or maybe they are just sick of dodging that stupid person on stilts who makes balloon thingies.  I hate that person.

It was my first time being to a symphony and it was fun. Everyone was dressed up and fancy, so I felt like they could tell that I was a mere commoner. The ceiling was high, there were lounges, cocktail bars, and fancy bathrooms. The show itself was incredible, but as expected some pieces lasted very long. I am not a true fan of Sibelius or Debussy as I prefer Chopin, Brahms, or Tchaikovsky, so that may have been the reason. Also, the concert lasted about 2 hours and I nearly fell asleep during it as I usually sleep at 8pm. 

I got a free cookie for some reason, which was amazing.

I love my vehicle. Service dept used to be great. They had a service director there (Tim) who was excellent and worked as an advisor for years. 

Now I go in for warranty work and they simply don't treat you with the respect I used to know. They have good points but bad ones too. Even an oil change takes forever ! No dealership is great but the service dept is what keeps a customer a customer. Unorganized and have an attitude. I would be even more mad if it wasn't warranty work and it came from my pocket.

Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde (Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron - $26.50) - 5 stars. Excellent. Mussels were so fresh and broth was so tasty. 

Steak Frites (a pan-seared prime flatiron served with matre d'htel butter - $34.50) - 4 stars. Was pretty good, esp due to the think layer of carmelized onions and other spices on top but the steak itself wasn't that flavorful and I asked for medium and got medium-well.  

Gigot d'Agneau  - (roasted leg of lamb with spring veggies, fennel dauphine - $31.00) - 4.5 stars. Lamb was super tender with only a slight gamey taste with good jus and very tasty fennel. I'm not a major lamb fan so I could have been 5 stars.

Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard (foie gras with toasted baguette $48.00) - 4.5 stars. My first time trying foie gras (pls forgive me you animal rights ppl). Came in a small 5 oz. canister under a layer of goose fat. The waiter carved off the goose fat to expose a rich delicious and generous portion of foie gras. (Of course, you are paying ~$50, so it better be generous.) It was rich and tasty and tasted even better with their special salt on top of small toasted bread pieces. Warning: this is a portion for at least 4-5 ppl to finish so it's too much for 2-3 ppl to order unless you want to take it home. 

Homemade brownies with ice cream - 4.5 stars - three luscious mini brownie bites with a bit of moist chocolate inside with ice cream. 

Overall service was very helpful and attentive but they did screw up a couple of things so it wasn't perfect. I asked for spinach on the side instead of fries for the steak and first they gave me green beans instead. Then they did apologize and bring out the spinach side - it was very fresh spinach in some butter but the SALTIEST thing I've ever had. We returned it and the waiter acknowledged that it was overly salty for whatever reason and apologized for that. We got a free dessert in return. 

Bottom line: Pretty good French bistro with great service but a couple of food and service goofs prevent me from giving it 5 stars. And it's French bistro style so don't expect a full French menu.",2007-06-13 07:40:05

I've only had a couple things on the menu: the teropita appetizer, the steak pita, the jalapeño burger, and the pepperoni pizza.  You can't go wrong with the teropita.  The soft, chewy dough is filled with a delicious egg and cheese mixture and is to die for.  I highly recommended you start you meal with this.  The steak pita is wonderful and what I always order - tender beef, grilled peppers, mozzarella, and grilled onions (which I always omit) on a wonderfully soft and delicious pita.  With it, I order a side of fried.  Do yourself a favor and order the fries extra crispy.  You won't be sorry!  The jalapeño burger is actually really great.  I don't know where they get their jalapeños, but they are always wonderfully spicy, sometimes EXTREMELY spicy, and always super fresh.  My only disappointing meal here has been the pizza.  I ordered it on a whim one day and was VERY disappointed.  I'm guessing it was an off day, as I've heard others rave about the pizza.  It didn't help that I found a hair on my first slice.  The waitress was very apologetic.  Not only did she comp my meal and offer to have something else made (I'd lost my appetite by then) but she also offered to give me a free meal on a future visit.  I declined the free meal, as I didn't feel it was necessary and knew I'd  be back again, but that went a long way.

Sometimes you go in and the guy behind the counter is your best friend, very complimentary (if sometimes a little too friendly with the ladies). Today however I went in for a little snack, the falafel appetizer. It came to $1.50 and I realized I had no change, took out my debit card and he says ""No way, it's a $5 minimum"", ""I don't have any cash"" I responded, to which he said ""not my problem - get out"". 

Nice to know he'd smothered them in tahini already for me - good luck reselling that.

The food is decent, there is way better in the city. The falafel especially can be disappointing as they fry a bunch at a time and serve them up cold very often. The sandwiches do get pressed briefly to warm them up but it certainly takes away from the warm/crisp of a freshly fried falafel ball.

My favorite Local band was playing there Friday night, so that was all I needed to give it a try.   
Everything I heard about the place was true. The ambiance was nice. It was everything you'd expect from a nice hotel restaurant. The menu wasn't huge, but there was a diverse selection. 

Our table of four to six quickly became a table for ten, which the restaurant accommodated even after two of us arrived early and were seated. The host and server were very professional and accommodating. 

Presentation was obviously important to the restaurant and it showed. Maybe I'm not as upscale as most people, but everything was lovely without being pretentious.
I ordered the soup du jour (shrimp bisque) which was phenomenal. For $6, I expected a tiny cup, but it was a generous sized portion in a bowl.   
While I'm not a fancy salad guy, I figured I've give the chop salad a go. It was better than I expected. It's hard to screw up a salad, but I've seen it done before. The candied walnuts were terrific.
For my entree, I ordered the scallops in ginger sauce. The menu said they were served with ramen noodles and I've really wanted to expand my ramen experiences. I was a poor college student once and I still like cheap ramen on occasion. I know you can get good ramen out there, so I figured I'd give it a go. It came with four scallops and a heaping portion of ramen mixed with some vegetables in a ginger sauce. I have a decent sized appetite, but I had to get the last of my meal to go. I ate it today (cold) and it was still good. 

Add a couple of Guinness drafts for me and we had a hefty bill, but I don't think that would stop me from returning again. Besides, if you use the 'other' restaurant reservation app that's the opposite of 'Closed Table', it's a 1,000 point restaurant. 

The restrooms were exceptionally clean and the staff was friendly. The bar area was crowded, but it was a Friday (early) evening. The band was supposed to play out on the patio, but the weather curtailed that idea. I would be excited to re-visit Jacksons and dine outside.   
Four of five stars in my review, but only because I can't give 4.5 out of 5. I think the prices could be cut back a little and the set-up was a little odd for a two-piece musical group. Also, the chairs might be good for people with perfect posture, but it felt like they made me lean too far forward. A weird thing, I know, but others may party mentioned the same thing. 

Definitely give it a try if you don't mind dropping a C-note on dinner for two.",2017-04-08 22:03:34

The very least I expected to see Chinese-English bilingual signage, but nope, nada. In that respect I found it was trying to hide the asianness of the supermarket... I guess you can say I'm biased, why should it be Chinese and not Vietnamese or some other asian language? I don't mind, as long as there is at least one asian language in there that would be cool. But I guess their wide asian product selection speaks for the asianness of the supermarket. 

There are definitely some good deals here and there, but of course I noticed some things that are more expensive than other places. 

A major thing that persuades me to go to any supermarket is the atmosphere... And I felt weird in this supermarket. I thought it would be a cleaner more proper version of an asian supermarket, but no, I was disappointed. I heard hacking/spitting of phlegm by a worker near the produce area. Then I saw a mop in a bucket at the salted fish area. The mop was under a shelf of salted fish and also beside a bucket of salted fish. I also find the fluorescent lighting to be very blinding...

So the former $10.99 Sunday dinner is now $17.99, but it now includes crab legs and other goodies. I'm adding a star for the better dinner quality. I don't know if they upgraded lunch enough to deserve more stars but the last lunch noted below was pretty bad.
--------------
9-5-17 Edit- I visited recently for lunch and was sorely disappointed. Although I've had pretty good meals for weekend dinners, lunch was pretty bad. The staff all seemed to be daydreaming and wishing they were somewhere else. Two waitresses were braiding each other's hair and the waiter was playing with his phone and the manager was reading by the cash register, but meanwhile nobody was properly running the place. There were a number of dirty plates at the buffet station and a number of empty trays that hadn't been filled for a while. Waitresses didn't come to refill water or take plates away unless you interrupt their hair-braiding and  ask them to come over. I won't go for lunch again, and I'll think twice about dinner if they're going to let their standards slip.

6-7-17 review
I was a fan of the Tokyo Sushi Buffet that was here before, and this place is NOT nearly as good for sushi. I first visited TJ Buffet just after they opened in April. Yuck, I turned around and left after seeing only a couple kinds of lousy looking sushi made with chopped mashed fish.

But TJ's has been steadily improving since then, especially for weekend dinner, so I suggest giving them a chance. They had clams and oysters on the half shell and cold shrimp, all of which were fresh. They had cold mussels too, but they were covered with a yucky slimy sweet sauce. They also had hot roast beef, hot crayfish, hot small clams in black bean sauce that was quite tasty. Chinese style ribs, chicken wings, Oh, and a couple ""genuine"" types of sushi, including tuna, salmon and octopus. Their sushi maker isn't very skilled; the sushi were misshapen and had finger dents, but the fish was pretty good.

All in all it is only about 75% as good as Tokyo Sushi Buffet was, but then again, it's only 75% of the price. I'm also glad to escape the lousy ""christian music"" soundtrack that Hokkaido buffet has been playing lately.",2017-06-08 00:10:56

It was very tasty but far too spicy for me to finish. Luckily my dining partner loved the spice and happily finished it. My dining partner ordered the spicy jerk chicken taco with avocado cream. It was the decided favorite of the three we ordered. I ended up finishing this one. It was not spicy to me and the avocado cream blended nicely with the jerk seasoning.

My husband is Italian and his father owned to traditional Italian restaurants in our home town.  That being said,  we still appreciate the modern twist to Italian too; however, this was neither.  They make their own pasta-  but it's is sticky, tastless and chewy.  It was aweful.  My husband and I both got pasta dishes and on both-  they cook forgot things that were supposed to be cooked into the pasta.  My huband got a spinach pasta,  the guy forgot to cook it in-  so his thought-  put the pasta from the plate back in the skillet,  add in the spinach and mix it around a couple of times.  Needless to say,  it was like cold raw spinach leaves with your hot pasta-- didn't really go.  The other thing-  no one is coming around and refilling drinks or taking your plates or bringing you your food-  so why would you have that massive clear box for tip money (right where the hostess is) when you go up to pay.  It just seemed tacky. 

You can't have it both ways-  either you are like a deli where you order at the counter and get your food- or have someone come around and at least refill your drinks, bus your tables (which was not done) and making sure everything is okay. 

I think this place has potential - but it just totally misses the mark.  The other thing-  if you want a drink-  you've go to go to the bar to order it,  then you have to go to this line for this,  then this line for that-  just doesnt make that much sense to me.",2012-02-02 14:22:15

You either have to take 60 (which is forever UNDER CONSTRUCTION.... just like all of AZ) or you can go a little out of the way and take 303 around the back side. Either way, its a long ways out, but well worth it. 

PARKING IS FREE!!!! This is always a good thing and a good start to the day. We parked up close and got some great tickets that put us in the shade. The gates opened at 11am (main gate only) and 1130 (side gate). Sadly, 11am is when batting practice ended, but it may just have been because the team had played a night game the night before. Either way, we were just content to sit out on the grass and enjoy the gorgeous weather. 

We got good tickets at the box office and got a chance to enjoy the day with a little shade cover. The first day our legs have seen sun is not the day to spend 3+ hours in it directly (even with sunscreen). 

There are lots of great food options in the stadium and SG got to enjoy his first baseball lunch, a big bratwurst with onions and peppers on it. Perfect. 

The perfect start to our spring training trip. Great weather. A great ballpark. Excellent food options. Great volunteers and community involvement. Great giveaways, if you are lucky enough to be sitting in those sections. And when you are lucky enough to be in town for a night game with fireworks, DO IT.

Tips: Turn off 60 on Greenway and go in the back way on to Bullard. Much less hectic! BYO food if you do not want to spend much in the ballpark.

I was slightly disappointed with my meal for the price I paid. I ordered the hot herbal jelly with tapioca, mini taro balls, peanuts, taro, and red bean. Overall the flavours were decent. Not too sweet and a big enough portion. The taro balls were mini so I didn't get the chewy texture that i would've liked. The peanuts came on the side so that was a nice touch. Herbal jelly was smooth but not much flavour altogether with the rest. Taro were big chunks.

I went with a friend when they first opened so we got the mochi for free. I would not recommend them as it's expensive and you end up getting 8 small pieces of mochi the size of your finger. That being said, for the dish to be over 5 dollars, they did not resemble Japanese mochi but rather Chinese rice cake. Texture was soft but not like that of mochi. The white one is better than the dark one as the dark one had some weird chemical like after taste. This was not worth it even when it was free.

Overall, not sure if I would go back as I prefer the other Taiwanese dessert places on yonge.

They have a manga section and located just off of the cafe section, they have magazines and comics! I found old Creep comics that were $5 that are really worth $15.

A few things aligned that led to me trying this place. Firstly I caught wind of a recently held event here where everyone raved about the food. Secondly my friend who was visiting me in Toronto wanted a restaurant with a good vibe for her last night in town...a Monday.

- professional and friendly hostesses and servers who treat you well regardless of whether you have a reservation or not
- the staff seem happy to work there, are attentive and I find I can always have a joke with them
- great vibe, tunes, noise level and lighting (the right amount of dark)
-  a nice big space with multiple floors
- a very consistent experience with regards to food quality and service
- a lot of variety for vegetarians and innovative menu options e.g. meal companions (sides) and the *cheap pours* aka discounted wine carafes

What I like:
- the burrata mozzarella
- the bruschetta (so many options)
- the red *cheap pours*
- the arrabiatta pasta (but be warned it has a slow burn spiciness)
- the polenta tots
- the charity bread

Definitely give this place a go. I think it would be a great place for a first date or a larger group dinner.",2015-12-06 20:20:07

I am a huge fan of Bar Buca but found this place really off putting. Both of our servers were just...crappy. Our main server seemed to have a language barrier and took wine glasses away when we told her we werent finished, plates away when we were still eating. The guy who brought our wine was serving it old som style and boasted ""its the only way its to be done"" but didnt even do it properly? It was such a confusing experience. 
This isnt the restaurants fault but my table of three other 20 somethings kept getting death glares from the middle aged people in the room. Whats that about?

Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!

We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.

The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie ""The Bird Cage"" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!

Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice.

It's nice to see the rooms have been updated since my last stay in 2005. It's a smaller hotel mostly adults and couples noticed during my comings and goings of my stay. 

Pros of the hotel + :

* No pool on property = didn't see any kids or babies on my visit. Less noise from kids or babies/toddlers screaming. 
* great location right on Sherbrooke near McGill University and a short walk from the main drag of Crescent, Concordia University and St Catherine's. 
* restaurant attached to the hotel with decent price of breakfast. 
* short walk from Guy-Concordia Metro
* lots of selection of excellent restaurants in the area. 
* my one bedroom suite had a fridge which was nice. 
* street parking is available if you are lucky and want to avoid the parking charge. 

Negatives of the hotel - : 

* no pool hot tub or sauna/ steam room. It's nice at times when hotels have these to kick it back in at night time. 
I remember clearly 10 years ago my wife had trouble sleeping because of the loud HVAC system. Amazing that in 10 years they haven't improved the heating-A/C. It sounds like a helicopter or jet engine is running all night. 
* parking is expensive at $27 for valet with in-out privelages
* hotel is old. Sure it's renovated but it does feel a lot like an weathered and worn building which has had minor but not major upgrades. 
* very small lobby and not many areas to lounge around. Many exceptional hotel have lots of lounging sections with comfortable chairs. 
* elevators are creaky and make some odd sounds going up or down......making you wonder if they are safe? 

Overall I'd stay here again if need was to be in the area. If you are a family And like the Starwood hotels. I'd recommend the Sheraton Centre or the Westin.

When I was yelling my order to the register girl I had said that I wanted the pick two combo, half tomato mozzarella Panini and mac n cheese.  When I picked up my plate what I got was my Panini and half a ham and cheese.  o_O  Mac n cheese does not equal ham and cheese.  And I ended up with a piece of baguette even though I said I did not want it.  Who wants that much bread on one plate?  The only thing I got right in this order was the lemonade.  I didn't even argue because I know that I wouldn't have been heard anyway.

When I got to the table, or should I said crumb top table, I was disgusted.  I really didn't even want to eat my food.  I know you are busy, but have one of the twenty or so employees prepping food come out and wipe down the tables that are recently emptied.  In fact, I really didn't eat my food, I more like picked at it.  One bite of the Panini and I was done, especially when I came across a nut that I'm pretty sure didn't belong in there.

I attempted there sad interpretation of a bathroom and left feeling even more dirty that I had when I stepped in there.  If I want Panera, I'll head to a different location, never this one again.  It is obviously the worst in this city.",2016-01-19 21:59:26

the vegetable egg rolls
veggie spring rolls
crispy happy pancake- it makes you happy, I swear
tofu chow mein or pad thai
vietnam basket (this is really big, for like $7 and comes with a bunch of different vegetarian items, such as tofu, broccoli, noodles etc. etc).
and for dessert: you must get the warm banana bread pudding.  it's sooooooo good.

OFKVsnOYaOH2olQZD1KJmg,vp93T_AshEE9blhTGtJWLg,nvBhlpH8TWbCl70_30gqxg,2,2,1,0,"I have been to this theater many times before, but I must say on my last visit there I was less than impressed. Not that I was over the moon on my previous visits. 

I was there with my family on a Monday night for an 8:20 showing of Monsters University. We got our tickets and went through the concession walk through/ self serve, which I honestly think is just silly, why can't they just have the regular concession counter like at the other theaters? The reason I don't like the self serve is because everything is always messy and sticky, which it was! People just let there kids who are too small to reach the soda fountain help themselves to whatever they want and they get soda everywhere! I don't mean to sound like a hard ass, but watch your kids people!!! So of course it doesn't get wiped up in a timely manner and thus everything in that walk thru is pretty gross! 

My family enters the theater and you know the build up when you walk in and you wonder how many people are already in there and you wonder if you will get to pick any seat you want or if it will be full already and you will have to sit next to strangers........ you know what I am talking about. 
So we walk down the corridor and round the corner, yay my kids get to pick whatever seats they want, blah blah blah..... I can't be excited for them because all I can see is garbage! Yes I said garbage! There was garbage, popcorn, candy boxes, soda cups, under all the seats! I had to turn around and make sure we didn't walk into a movie that was already playing! But in fact we were in the correct theater and that was in fact trash under all the seats! So apparently they don't actually sweep out the trash, instead they just sweep it under the seats?!?! I was freaking out, but I had to do my best to put my OCD away so I didn't ruin the night for my kids. My hubby didn't even have to look at me to know what was going on, he did his best to find the seats with the least trash. 
Then once the movie started we noticed there was a big scratch down the left side of the movie screen! Seriously, this was not going to be my night! 

This was just a lesson learned for my husband and I. We prefer the Aliante movie theater but we chose to go to the Santa Fe because it was closer to our house, we chose poorly! We will make the drive next time!",2013-06-25 20:59:16

LVE did the root canal, and a temporary crown was placed over it.  My spouse then had to make an appointment with her actual dentist to have a permanent crown created and installed.

We waited patiently for our food since they were so busy. My sister ordered grilled chicken sandwich $14.00 with fries and I had ordered duck soup for $11.00... I thought the price for the sandwich was a bit too expensive, especially from a cafe style restaurant.
When we got our food, my sister complained about the size of the chicken. The waiter said it was a 5 ounce...humm... more like a 3 ounce to me! It was so small it didn't even cover the bottom of the bread. (see photo attached to my review)
It looked ridiculous. I couldn't stop laughing!!!! I have never seen anything like it. And to think they would have the audacity to serve that type of low-quality food to a guest and ask for $14.00 in return? For a chicken sandwich? Wow! I would be so embarrass if I was in charge of that restaurant . 
My sister spoke to the manager. He apologized and told her that he would give us 20% off the entire bill. What about 60% more chicken in that sandwich? Lol! We agreed to the 20%. The last thing you ever want to do is to send the food back to the back kitchen.  Needless to say, we will not be eating there ever again. Even if we were starving. 
At least our waiter was nice, attentive, and very apologetic. I still left him a 25% tip.

I would definitely call this place an eatery.  It is small, cozy, friendly, very japanese-ish, and yet still very metropolitan and hip.

My favorite of the evening included the following ... respectively... Beef Tongue (it was heaven), whole baby squid, the Kobe version of Chicken (be aware: chicken will never taste the same), the Hoke fish (fish of the day) and the bacon wrapped tomatoes.  Bacon wrapped scallops were WAY over cooked and tasted like chewing on an eraser off a No. 2 pencil.  I'm sure it was an over-sight and I woud give it a try again.  I didnt' get the feel that sushi was the chef's forte, but then again, it's not everyday that you see Aji (Spanish Mackerel) on the sushi menu.  I got the Aji sashimi and was completely blown away and was more than satisfied.  Just like I had remembered from other sushi restaurants, it was rich, yet not fishy at all, flavorful in ways only Aji could be, and of course that recognizable sweet after taste.  *rolling eyes backwards* it was JUST deeeeelicious!!!  The service is also definitely worth yelping about.  Service was insightful, genuine, and real.  You actually get the feeling that they are excited about the food there and they care about the food or tongue you're about t ingest.  :-P  This place has earned a top 3 spot in my book.

Miwd7N0eU8w6rZg86aQZsg,FadewNTxVINfAxou0FoAyg,GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,5,1,0,1,"I've been coming to Miega for years and finally decided to write a review because this place is great! I've come here with friends in groups and by myself for lunch, no problems whatsoever. 

The Food
I've tried multiple things off of the menu. I love the barbeque, it's a great way to eat with friends as you can cook it at your table. The menu in that area is pretty extensive and well-priced. Their kimbap and dokkbokki are also pretty good.

If I don't come here for the barbeque I come here for the sundubu jigae with seafood. It's a lovely stew that screams comfort food. Miega, out of all of the Korean restaurants in the area, does it best. They don't skimp out on the veggies (onions and zucchini), the tofu, or the seafood. There's always a lot of seafood and the dish looks like a stew as a opposed to a soup, as it should. Plus there's a raw egg thrown in that cooks along with the stew as you eat it (it's in a hot stone pot). As to the spice level, I wouldn't say this is spicy but it's definitely not mild. It's hard to give a good gauge as well...I'm white and hardly ate spicy food before spending several months in Korea - the taste buds adapted. I would highly recommend it, if you come for lunch it's a bit cheaper! My total was $11 for lunch - not bad considering the amount of food you get!

Miega also does great banchan (side dishes). You normally get the staple, kimchi (two types: radish and cabbage), and the rest is often a guess but it's always good. This time around I got dried squid in a sauce, never had it before but it was beyond good. What's more, if you run out of a side dish, you can ask for more - same goes for rice and it's at no extra charge.

VEGEGTARIANS - note that while there may be veggie options, if you aren't pescatarian I'd double check if they use things like anchovies, fish sauce, etc. Anchovies can often be found in the making of the broth itself for some of the dishes. 

The Price
I'd say the price is spot on for the food. In comparison to other Korean restaurants in the area, I would argue it's cheaper for some dishes than other places. Even though that's the case, the menu is extensive, decently priced, and everything's delicious. 

The Atmosphere
The place is well decorated and doesn't feel confined. There's plenty of tables, both booths with the grill installed and normal tables. If you come at a busy time wanting barbeque and there's no booths, not too worry, Miega can set you up with a portable grill at a table (similar to how Seoul Garden does). It's clean and there's normally a tv playing that's visible to the patrons, always fun if there's a music program going on.

The Service
I've always had great service here. The servers are very open to answering your questions and giving you recommendations, great for those who don't know too much about Korean food. A lot, if not most, of the tables are equipped with a button that rings to get the servers attention. I love the type of service, you are left alone to enjoy your food unless you need help and then you ring the bell.",2017-10-12 21:05:58

The display of the photos of various parts of the world from the old days.  You can see the imagination of the artists sometimes posted together different photos for a street but with a closer glance the cars on the street are cut by the photos though the buildings are all aligned.  There are aerial photos.  There are photos that I cannot understand with a single color all through the frame - beyond my understanding.  

Interesting enough are the displays in the 2 small rooms.  One with projectors on the four walls each with different colors and shapes projected on the walls with moving parts.  I may be able to copy that.  The other room is with a total of 6 big photos.  These I consider very hard to shoot unless you are professional.  There is one that is almost mono-color white but it is the daylight far view of a white sand beach with sky and water all merged together.  You may spot a horizontal separation but it is not the separation between the sky, water or beach.  It is the fence set up all along the coast on the beach.  What a technic.  Another mono-color one is all black.  It is shot from inside the car through the windshield with the rain drops settled on the glass with a dim headlight from a car far away.  The contrast of each rain drop and the surrounding objects are so intense that not one single spot is out of focus.  Not matter why it is on the Contact exhibit display.  There are other great ones but these two are too eye catching.

The hors d'oeuvres are very nice.  I like the minced salmon patties, the crab meat tart and the mini mini steak burger with stretch of horseradish.  There are many international beers to choose from and I tried one from France Kronenbourg 1664 which is a 5.5% pale lager.  It is one of the leading brand in France with 40% market share.

Its made when you order so all dishes comes out HOT and fresh! The waitress that afternoon was very friendly and constantly came by to make sure everything was okay and if you needed to add any more items.

There is a wide selection of curries and items. I really enjoyed the chicken masala, it was full of flavors and chicken was moist!!!! Lamb was great as well. They come in these small dishes, so you can try other items too and not be full after eating one dish. I was not to impress with their shirmp curry, it had flavor but it was not like the others.

I would love to come back and try their other items on the menu.

Try it out!!!",2017-11-07 05:29:01

First, it has to be food that we cannot easily make at home. Second, the quality of product has to be exceptional. Last, it has to be reasonably priced for what you get.
So far to date there is only one restaurant in the Las Vegas valley that exceeds all of my three criteria; it's called Café De Japon. It seems that I am not the only one that feels this way.
I first heard about them in the Las Vegas weekly. The restaurant is clean and open. With minimal seating they can probably seat 90 people if they squeeze everyone in. It is warm and inviting. The chef who is also the owner greats you when you first walk in from behind the counter, he takes the time to learn your name. One of the three staff that they have will seat you either at a table or at one of the counter seats. At the counter you can watch the chef prepare the cold dishes, like sushi or Carpaccio. 
The owner only brings in the best of ingredients. The restaurant has a regular menu but the specials are what you should come to this place for. They have a big white board with all kinds of words written on it, a lot of them you will not recognize. I had to ask the chef a few times how to pronounce and describe what goes into the special dishes. With these specials he brings in fish from other countries and states. Fish that we cannot easily obtain at home in our local grocery store. That meets my first criteria of a restaurant that I'd like to return to.
 The chef will not serve any of this fish unless he would eat it himself. The freshest vegetables are used. The quality of meat is superior to anything that I could buy in the super market. They also have a variety of drinks like a yuzu soda. I have never had this drink anywhere else in my life and would not even know where to begin to look for it anywhere else. It's made from a fruit called a yuzu fruit. It is so exotic that it is only found in remote parts of East Asia.
While many reviews online say that the restaurant is overpriced, I think the cost is worth it. I leave full and every time I feel like I've had one of the best meals of my life for under eighty dollars. I know it seems that eighty dollars is a lot of money for two people to eat, but the different flavors and textures that you get to have is worth it. The quality is great, the price is reasonable and the food is good quality. It meets all my criteria for returning to a restaurant, over and over.",2013-04-14 00:55:10
fsRq6T_pfQnGmt8-gI_G1Q,cDWyzwC3UztZ-17nolrb0g,QNfh79NwsNnl-AngRhg2ww,4,1,0,0,"Recently came across a list of the Top 50 'must eat at' restaurants in Toronto, so making it a mission to try them all - eventually.  Kingyo was one of these.  

Location/ambience:
- Located just off Parliament in Cabbagetown, we lucked out and got a spot right out front of the place, so can't complain - but then again it was around 9pm so you might need to park further if you come early.  Nicely decorated inside, louder than most restaurants, and you're greeted quite openly when you arrive.  So far so good..

Food/price:
- Took the advice from several other reviewers in deciding what to get, so here's the rundown:

- TAKE WASABI - got a split of half hot, half cold octopus with seaweed wrap.  The cold was a little slimy (which I expected) but also very chewy (which was a negative).  The hot was much better - if you're trying it, get the hot.  Not a great value but makes for a nice starter.

- TUNA-TATAKI WITH PONZU JELLY - bar none best dish of the night.  Get it.  The tuna just melts in your mouth and the jelly is amazing.  Don't question it - just get it.

- STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE - for $10, it's expensive.  You get maybe 8-12 pieces of very thinly sliced beef to cook on a hot stone, with a few condiments (oil, hot paste) for dipping.  High on novelty so was neat to try - do it if you want to try something different, not if you want to get full..

- CHICKEN KARAAGE with magic powder - ok I'm guessing the 'magic powder' is just salt, pepper, and MSG - but who knows.  It was good - the chicken is dark, juicy, and has some gristle to it (which I like but you might not), and has a great batter.  Most Western-feeling dish of the night

- PORK BELLY - very fatty, but so good.  Scraped off most of the top fat and had the rest (though I admit it was tempting to eat the fat too, it was that good..)

- SHORT RIB - last dish of the night, and it was BIG.  Nice and tender and with a great sweet dark sauce, if you weren't full before this, you'll be full after you're done..

Overall:
- Definitely enjoyed the range of different dishes.  Price-wise, it's not the greatest value, especially the Take Wasabi and Beef Tongue, but until I compare some other places on the 'Top 50' (Guu, I'm looking at you..), I'll reserve judgment over whether I'll return again.",2013-09-05 21:25:16

An angry looking gentleman walked by the bar slowly looking around & I asked if he was the manager (to compliment the person up front because as of late service has been RUDE. The response was a curt and rude ""yea"", so I asked ""do you have a quick moment?"" He responds with even more attitude & irritated ""yes.""

He then walked off (muttering under his breath) and proceeded to the back of the restaurant and clearly expressed something about me to the 3 waitresses that were in back.

My friend and I didn't go full out for the waffles and crepes, which a lot of people seemed to get.  However, we both got cake and lattes.  I had myself the red velvet cake - the slices are HUGE.  However, since my sweet tooth is going away, I couldn't finish it.  I had a green tea latte, and an earl grey tea latte the second time.  Typical lattes.  My friend had the sweet potato latte, and she really enjoyed it (I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato, but it was pretty good).

The first time we went, it was quite busy.  However, the second time I went, it was more quiet (early Friday evening) -- then it got busy and noisy again.  So, if you're planning to have a quiet evening, it MIGHT be a bit difficult, because large groups may come by in there sometimes.

I used to come here before they changed everything up. It was the perfect Italian lunch spot - excellent location, solid food, great service. But it seems that Locale Mercatto is now a shell of its former self.

For starters, and as others have mentioned, the entrance is hard to find. 

The menu is a lot worse. They no longer do pizzas. They do panini sandwiches but if you ask me, that's practically a write-off when you go to an Italian restaurant.

They used to bring fresh bread to your table, they no longer do this. They even used to offer fresh parmesan with their pastas; you guessed it, they no longer do this either.

I chose to eat the Spaghetti di Mare. It was okay, a little blander than expected. In fact, if you compare the picture of my dish to other reviewers, mine looks much drier and less creamy. 

Where it really went downhill was when a couple friends ordered the dish consisting of salmon and rice. It was lukewarm at best, so we asked a server if it was supposed to be hot. She said yes, so we let her know that it wasn't. She offered to have the kitchen remake it, but instead, they seemed to just throw the food in a pan, mushing everything together, breaking down the salmon. Not a big deal since we're not ones to complain, but it seemed unprofessional to get re-served a dish that looked the way it did (see picture). Plus, we really didn't need the added attitude from the other server (2 people were serving us).

Simply put, avoid this place.",2017-07-29 23:07:00

We entered the small restaurant and were almost knocked out by the loud volume of 70s classics anthem songs. As we sat we were quickly served a basket of half crushed chips and a salsa that lacked typical salsa flavors. Since there was four of us we ordered a pitcher of margaritas. After one sip I found the margarita cloyingly sweet and almost liquor free. It was like sucking on hummingbird water. Someone was running around giving everyone tickets for a floatation giveaway in the bar. The number was called soon after and someone left with a nifty corona floatation raft.

A table gets sat next to us and one person from our table really didn't have any space between them and the person from the next table.

We all thought tacos would be a good appetizer since they were on special for happy hour. My husband's short rib taco was very dry and was bland. It lacked fresh herbs and chiles, it was very flat as well as the tacos the other people had at the table. I had the snapper taco. They did prepare the fish better than all the other meats but it also lacked flavors and the flavor it did have was mostly just strong vinegar from the pickled onions. It lacked fresh green onions, fresh cilantro and a pop of chiles would have been nice. It just tasted vinegary with really super sweet chunks of pineapple that seemed like sweetened canned pineapple.

Out of the three appetizers, the drinks, and four dinners only my dinner was actually very good. But I got the kale and mango salad. My salad was prepared nicely, it was tasty and what really surprised me was that the salmon was cooked very nicely. I do note that this might have been the most expensive item on the menu and was a WHOPPING $18.75 for a salad. I know it's Scottsdale but that is higher pricing than what a salad cost on the strip in Las Vegas. I also note the salad did come in small and large and when I asked about the difference my interpretation was that the small looked like a four inch side salad and the large looked like about a foot. 

My husband had the carnitas that was very dry and undeveloped with flavor.

One person at the table had the carne asada fajitas. They were very dry and that person told the waitress and she offered to make a new dish  and latter took the fajitas off the bill.

We weren't offered a bag for transportation of course so that was a disaster. On a positive note, we liked the atmosphere... It was very hipster.

The pizzas are thin with a perfectly crispy crust. My husband orders the sausage and adds mushrooms. It's really good. He eats about 2/3 of it and has a nice treat for breakfast the next day.

I really like their ""fancy salad"" with fresh  greens, bleu cheese, real bacon bits and avocado slices. So darn good.

The cheese bread has roasted red peppers, bleu cheese and bacon, topped with mozzarella. Wow, that's good stuff!

9vlZ82xPMdPlnEZMzQxz1A,Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,4,3,0,0,"During my recent visit, I found a few changes that I need to update fellow yelpers about Shabu Grill.

The major change is the price, which is the reason for one less star on the rating. In the past, lunch price was $15.95 and dinner price was $19.95 no matter it was weekend or not. Now, the dinner price is $24.95 and they don't have lunch price on the weekend, so basically you have to pay for dinner price even if you go there during lunch hour on weekend. In my opinion, this latest price increase will doom their business. How can I tell? The place was basically empty the entire time we were there on the weekend. My advice to the owners is the lower the price back to $19.95 for both lunch and dinner. Keeping the lunch at $15.95 would be better if you can afford it.

Now to the food: To justify their price increase, they added some additional items onto their menu. There are now 4 different kinds of crabs (blue crab, snow crab, Dungeness crab, and crystal crab), scallops, and oysters. Now everybody know these shellfishes are expensive but why the heck do you feel the need to provide 4 different kinds of crab????? Your restaurant is a hot pot place, not a seafood restaurant, there is no need to provide so much variation of shellfishes. Get rid of the crystal crab and Dungeness crab, they make the soup smelly. As for the half shelled oysters, do you expect your customers to dump that dirty shell item into the same soup broth that they put their veggies, tofu, and meats? Either provide oysters without shells or just remove it from your menu. Same thing applies to the scallops.

Personally, I still like this place because their food are very fresh and clean. However, unless they lower the price down, I will not visit them as often as I have done in the past. Again, by reducing or eliminate unnecessary items from their menu, they can afford to lower the price and still maintain their profit margins.",2014-09-10 18:17:46

But still.... OUTSTANDING!  Really.

We're renting a house and are from out of town over the 4th weekend and are only eating at restaurants we cannot eat at where we live.  I found this restaurant on Yelp, read all the reviews and looked at every photo, and convinced the wife we should try it out.

Two warning signs I'm glad we didn't pay any attention to.  First, Open 24/7 was one red flag.  Second was the bar-side casino.  Ignore those!  When you walk in the front door you have two options; go right into the bar side which has smoking and gambling, or go left into the non-smoking dining room.  We chose to go left as I was with 2 children.

The dining room side seats about 40 people total, is warm yet modern feeling with nice tables and chairs.  We sat in the chairs a while and never got uncomfortable.  Plus, everything is new and sturdy... no wobbly tables needing a sugar packet under one leg.

There are TV sets on in the dining room with the sound off.  The Muzak is piped in but very soft.  Just about perfect.  Mostly it played 70's popular music (Boston, etc...).  Easy to tune out or listen to if you like the song.  You can also see through the glass window separating the bar and dining room if you're not facing the TV sets and can view 4 others that way if a sporting event is on that you're interested in watching.

Our waitress Edna was awesome.  She just needed a little help.  Or maybe we showed up along with everyone else around the same time.  No big deal... we put on our patience caps and just enjoyed the music.  Edna was exceptionally friendly and seemed to know everything about the menu as well as the chef and owners.  She did a great job of filling us in.

The food!  Well, it was 10:30am and we weren't interested in Breakfast so I asked if we could look at the lunch/dinner menu.  No problem!  I also had a beer.  Don't judge we're on vacation.

I had the Greek Meatball appetizer with fries and I believe tzatziki sauce (it was white and good).  We also ordered the House Special Beef Tips, Chicken Parm and Chicken Piccata.  The food was 5-Star all the way.  I'm serious.  Our dinner the night before on the strip at a steakhouse was $400 for four and this food was better.  We were all quite shocked at the quality this early in the morning when they're cooking breakfast for most people.  I read the reviews and knew it was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS good!

The fries are crazy good and every meal came out piping HOT.  The chicken piccata was cooked perfectly, was as moist as chicken can get, and the sauce with capers was incredible.  The Greek meatballs are great, as was the Chicken Parm (with penne noodles).  The steak on the House Special Beef tips is so tender and good I can't believe they don't charge more for the meal.  You can get a sauce on the side with this meal also for dipping which is really good, but not needed at all.  The steak flavor and tenderness was better than the $60 Tomahawk Ribeye I had the night before.

Everyone wants to go back.  Our rule on vacation is never eat at the same place twice but we may break that rule.  Plus if the service is better I can upgrade this to a 5 star review which it was this place deserves.

OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!",2015-07-04 19:00:27

We ordered the special which is a PBR & dog. We got our beers and sat. After what seemed like a really long wait our dogs came out. The dogs were as amazing as I remember! The vegan dog is flavorful and chewy but not rubbery like faux meats are sometimes. The toppings were great as usual (that pineapple sauce and crumbled chips are soooo yummy!). 
As for service, that leaves much to be desired. As well as time for the food to come, although there was only one other person there. I appreciate that it's all fresh, but I think we waited about 15 mins..for hot dogs. Nonetheless, it's vegan hot dogs so I'll deal w it for my occasional hot dog desire!

We showed up twenty minutes early and were literally the only guests there until about five minutes before showtime. We started to panic thinking we might be the only ones in the audience. Improv is awkward enough... imagine the entertainers performing for an audience of two. Cue cringe. Fortunately, the place filled up right before the show began, and we were on our way.

The place itself is... quaint? Seats aren't super comfortable, there is no stadium seating or anything like that, but the walls are really neat and littered with awards, performers' profiles, and retro posters. There is also a concession stand on the way into the theater. Overall, the establishment on first impression is great, but the theater itself was lacking a little. Kind of blah, like a cafeteria or something with dim lights to make it seem more homey.

I know that this was an improv show, but I feel like the announcer should at least be prepared confidently host, but it seemed like they just took him off the street and said, ""Hey, I need you to introduce this thing, come with me!"" I'm certainly not upset about that, but it was just a little thing that I think they can improve on. I was also sad that out of the ten or so performers, not one was a woman. I know that they do have women performers for other shows, but I feel like they should have women represented in every show. I know this is a personal preference, but I really would have enjoyed it more, had there been a few qualified females onstage.

That being said, although as with improv, not everything will be a hit, I found a lot of the content pretty darn funny. There were two guys that really stole the show (bearded chubby man and tan dude with glasses, I'm looking at you), but overall the performers were entertaining and fun to watch. I would likely come back again, because my husband and I did have a good time overall, and the tickets are inexpensive.

This happens to be one of those times. Recently, I decided to clean my closet out - some were donated and some I thought I could maybe get some money for. I have never been to a consignment store before because I usually donate. After all, I usually feel better about myself for it. However, this chick is getting married this year so I thought it would be nice to get a couple of bucks. 

I didn't walk into the store with a trash bag of items. I walked into the store with ten or so items on a hanger because we all know that presentation is everything sometimes. I walk in right away and the store was empty. 

No one acknowledges me. I walk up to the counter and I say ""hi"" first. The lady asks me if I have ever consigned before and I said ""no"". She told me to leave my stuff on the counter and stroll around while she takes a look. I start shopping - ten minutes go by, fifteen minutes go by, twenty minutes go by and the lady looks like she is done looking at my items and talking on the phone. She doesn't even go up to me to tell me if they are interested or not. She doesn't tell me what they are looking for. She doesn't tell me anything. 

So I go up to the other salesgirl and ask her if they are interested. She says ""no"" - they are not interested in those items. I walk out feeling so weird. 

So, on my way back home, I stop at smarty pants consignment and they take a few items. Here are the differences: They were nice, friendly, and they informed me what they are looking for and what they are not, how the process works, etc. Even when they didn't take some items, I didn't feel weird. Why? It's because of good customer service!

Even if PLRG didn't take any of my items, if they were nice, friendly and informative, I wouldn't have felt so bad. I would have even bought a necklace from there, but I won't be spending money at an establishment that doesn't see value in customer service - regardless of who you are, what you look like, and what you bring in to sell.",2015-03-05 20:20:39

Initially we were confused about whether or not the place was even open (6pm Superbowl Saturday night) because there only sat one lone soul at the bar, sure enough Tyler greets us at the door with an exasperated muttering about how he just ran an order up the street and that a bartender flaked out on work last minute ....and me being me just said ""So is that a YES?!"" I figured at the very least I was determined to see if staying for a full meal was warranted pending a taste of the salt fish fritters I had been craving since stumbling upon their menu on Yelp the night before. ... To my delight they came out hot, fresh, crispy and were definitely appetizing, (especially paired with a Red Stripe heehee). 

While checking in with a few snapshots of the boutique-like entry way and main dining room, an obviously annoyed, buxom-blonde-backup-barista (?) delivered food to our table, and again,  me being me was determined to turn her frown upside-down, so I pumped her for info on the history of the joint while we patiently waited on entrées... I swear this chick seems like the perfect addition to the next Quentin Tarantino movie I'd want to watch... After a few basic questions she went from zero to 60 in a flash and (without yelping your eyes out) in a nutshell she told us all about her funny relationship with her father and even crawled on the floor during this candid storytelling session... I'm just flattered to know I can get strangers to be so comfortable with opening up to me so quickly.... but Phoenix has proven to be full of quite ""chillaxed"" beings so I dunno how much credit I can really take for it. Long story short- I discovered this little gem had almost been lost forever until ambitious,  young Tyler stepped in to save it, and he seems truly passionate about keeping good food flowing and good service abound! 

Although I was told the oxtail would need another 15-20 minutes after I ordered it (twice), I in fact never received my entrée because they really did need an hour to be truly palatable,  I assured him that I was willing to wait for them, he was thoughtful enough to bring me a sample and even though they weren't falling off the bone I could taste ""the love"" and look forward to coming back for em! He also shared & sent us several complimentary shots of Appleton rum and I thoroughly enjoyed the beef patties (the crusty shell is awesome) and the stew chicken was realllly tasty, especially with the fried dumplings, aka ""Johnny cakes."" 

The ONLY issue we had was when the side of rice & beans were (noticeably) dry/leftover from another day and slipped on to the plate, we immediately received a fresh order and it was great.   

Before we left we received some cards offering free appetizers! Good deal!

Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...""

When we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a ""dance party"". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.

I think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. 

I WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their ""secret recipe"" and were amazing. I had two actually.

Anyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future. Don't think I'll be going for any dance parties!",2012-04-01 05:14:08

This is probably one of Toronto's best kept secrets!
I was taken to Allwyn today by a friend who's been singing in my ear about it for months! As soon as we stepped into this tucked away shop I knew I was in for a treat!
That distinct smell of sugary goodness used in Caribbean baked goods gets you salivating even before the hilarious co-owner C.K. can ask what you're doing in his store!! C.K. is a very entertaining fellow, for one he was mad at my friend for introducing me to the shop saying that he's already so busy making food for the customers and now I'm going to become another addict! He then went on to tell me how welcomed he felt when he moved to Canada and saw everybody wearing clothes with his name on it! He also doesn't believe in advertising, because he has enough trouble keeping up with customers who find the hidden shop through word of mouth. Long story short, I'd recommend checking out this place for meeting this dude even if you don't like jerk!

On to the food, the jerk chicken sandwich is maybe the best I've had. The fresh, in store baked coco bun makes such a very big difference, and the chicken itself is very tender and flavourful. There are a variety of other options including patties, goat curry, pork, and also a few varieties of bread (raisin loaves are recommended), but if it's your first time trekking to this spot, you can't go wrong with jerk chicken sandwich at just under $4.

Quite a few people in the Vietnamese community feel they have the best pho in Toronto behind Pho Tien Thanh on Ossington Ave. Yes Pho Dau Bo is a chain but this particular location is run and owned by a Vietnamese family and not Chinese owners which usually makes a significant difference in the authenticity and quality of food.

The broth is excellent, the noodles are not bad, pretty consistent, never undercooked or overcooked. The quality of meat is good, thinly sliced and slightly rare and not covered in fat.

My love for Watan Kabob, goes without saying. This place serves some of the freshest, and tastiest afghan food - in giant portions, and cheap too!

In the past year, it has defaulted into one of our go-to takeouts, and it has yet to disappoint.

Everything is A LOT quicker than it looks. Don't let the lengthy lines and crowds, turn you away!

My usuals consist of the 'Kofta (ground beef kabobs) dinner' or the 'Chaplee dinner'. Nothing ever comes dry, the food in taste and quality is always consistent. The sauce they give you, is never enough. Ask for more!

Whatever you choose, the portions are big enough to happily satisfy you. Their dinner comes with either rice, salad and naan. You can also opt out of rice & get just naan & salad. 

Their Qabulee rice (rice with carrots & raisins), are a nice switch up, but the rice that comes with the dinners are far from bland!
The Naan, believed to be cooked in a tandoor clay over, IS SO FREAKING GOOD. It always comes fresh & warm - crisp but SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY on the inside. Mmmmm.

Each auditorium appears to be renovated with recliner seats and tiered seating. Seats are assigned...which can present a challenge for larger groups trying to see a last minute showing. I prefer assigned seats over not as I don't have to worry about where I'll be able to find a seat.

We were brought inside to the table area and seated. They had the ice and juice ready and after brought out the bottles we had selected. We chose ciroc and kettle one to mix our drinks with.

Unlike most others (probably), I found out about the deal at approximately 4:45pm and immediately convinced my roommate that we needed to go that night. 

Upon walking up to Bar Louie, we found a rambunctious crowd, with pretty much all of the patio seats--on both sides--full, despite it being a chilly December evening. That's how hoppin' it was. We walked inside and were pretty confused due to the lack of hostess stand or any nearby workers. We caught a waitress walking by, and confirmed that the entire place was open seating. Totally fine, just would've preferred that it was somehow made clear. We lucked out and found a couple seats at the bar immediately, where the specials were explained to us and drink orders taken right away. 

We both opted for the burger special, because how can you pass up a regularly $11-12 burger for $5?! (Ya can't). I went with the Bulleit burger, cooked medium and with a side of fries, and she went with the Southwest burger. The burgers took a little while to come out, but that was to be expected with how busy they were that night. My burger was really great, but to be honest, I pretty immediately scraped the cream cheese block off of it--I was iffy about it in the description to begin with, but into the rest of the burger enough to try it out. I just thought the inclusion of cream cheese was a super weird call, considering the rest of the toppings were: bacon, crispy onions, and a bbq-like bourbon sauce. But like I said, after the lil cream cheese issue, it was a great burger. That being said, I'm not sure I would have liked it as much had I paid the full $12 price tag (I'm real cheap). The fries were also top notch, and I'm pretty picky about my fries. But it came with approximately a dozen and a half, and everyone always needs more than 18 fries. 

Our service was good because we were at the bar, but it looked like some others at tables and booths were having some issues getting staff members' attention and such. 

Overall, I'd say it was a decent experience. The food was good, I just always want more french fries. The environment was a little overwhelming, it was pretty damn noisy in there, and super crowded for a Tuesday night--assuming this was due to the special. I'll probably give Bar Louie another try.

When I first walked in, it seemed like a nice, clean, and pretty hopping establishment. The interior was clean, and it drew a mostly Asian crowd, which is a good indicator of nicely-made food. I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee with a banh mi containing pate, Vietnamese bacon, and other Vietnamese-style cold cuts. Everything was very cheap and the total came to under $10, making this a very economical choice for people looking to eat under a budget. The coffee had a nice balance of strong flavors mixed with a milky undertone and icy coolness, and the banh mi was one of the best I've ever had. The creaminess of the pate combined with the variety of meats, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and spiciness of the peppers (and by spicy, I mean pretty spicy) made for an overall divine sandwich. It should have ideally been a great meal. So where is the problem, exactly?

Well, a few hours after consuming all of this goodness, I started feeling quite nauseous and couldn't put my finger on where it came from. It lasted for the better part of a few hours and it wouldn't seem to go up. I hadn't eaten anything else that day, and I was wondering if the banh mi had anything to do with it. It sounds bizarre, especially given how the inside didn't seem dirty at all and the fact that I've eaten banh mi countless times before.

Some have given this place high marks just for being a great neighborhood bar but I am focused more on the food so can't speak to its bar life so to speak.

The obvious high marks are what others have already simply stated...great, hidden gem, neighborhood feel, house converted, bla bla bla...Yes, that's all very true.  

Bring your glasses if you have poor eyesight because this place is very dimly lit but I think it adds to the romantic aspect and it makes it pretty cozy.

The service was mediocre...I have to give a shout out to the buff host that has been there all 3 times that I have.  He looks like an abercrombie model that moonlights as the host of Alexander Michael's.  He just makes me smile for some reason.  But as far as the wait staff..eh, ok.  They seemed overly busy and understaffed quite honestly.  I hated to even ask any questions to our waitress in fear of flight.  She didn't stick around and she seemed to just have too much going on in general.  Whatever, no big deal.  

The food I think is consistently good.  The fried pickles are good, their cajun fries are crispy, good flavor, their other sides are OK, not amazing.  I tried their veggie and quinoa burger and I thought it was pretty good!  My friend had the burger and wasn't asked how she wanted it cooked so that was a BAD sign.  Not fresh.  Aaaand, it wasn't.  It was a little dry, not much flavor, just bleh in general.  The prices are right for their burgers and sandwhiches but they really should be based on the quality.

They have other specials and regular meal items that may be amazing but overall I think everything is just basic, consistent, good, not great.

Easily my worst sushi experience in Las Vegas. The space itself isn't bad with a clean decor and friendly service. The fail all comes with the quality of the sushi and the combinations in the rolls here. Typically when i do AYCE sushi i am 90% nigiri and 10% rolls. After placing my traditional 90/10 order for the first round, the quality made me want to order rolls to cover up the sub par quality of the fish. I found myself not even wanting to eat some of the nigiri but i felt as if i had to as to not get charged extra for it in the end. Second round was more rolls than anything was also a disappointment because there was just so much sauce, a mess of combinations, and flavor that didn't resemble anything delicious. After paying the bill i felt cheated to be honest, as i felt like i was fed something i didn't want and was forced to pay for it. A terrible feeling if you were hoping to go out for a nice dinner.

Once translated everything sounded delicious, but I settled on the ricotta and bread, especially after hearing that their bread was baked in house.  We took our food back to Le Petite Hotel*  and I savored every last bite of this ricotta goodness. Soooo delicious! My traveling companion seemed just as happy with her salad.

I've dined at Dressler's with my mister, taken prospective employees out to dinner here, and hosted a retirement party lunch here. Like a lot of people, I fall into restaurant ruts, but that is not the case with Dressler's. So, why the multiple visits? 

To start, the view is great, especially if you happen to dine on a warm evening and can eat outside. Lots of great people watching from that vantage! The decor inside is sophisticated enough to impress a client or for a celebration, but casual enough to have a nice meal without a lot of fuss. On my several visits here, the food has been consistently good from appetizers through dessert. I have to say, I am partial to the pork chop or the ribeye steak. I want to note as well the expansive gluten-free menu with a range of options beyond salads like a lot of other restaurants. 

I also want to second how seamless event planning is here. Rhonda was a pleasure to work with, and the wait staff were so accommodating.

I apologize if it seems that I'm jumping on the Greenhouse Tavern love train here, but this is one of my top 3 favorite restos in Cleveland. Period. 

When you repeatedly visit a business that continues to impress you more and more after each time, you know it's good. That's exactly what Greenhouse does. They've surprised me superior service, cuisine and an all around amazing dining experience since my very first visit.

The food is always prepared to perfection and consistently divine. I love the ever changing menu that suits the season's bounty and how the chef keeps some favorites on board too. A green restaurant that supports local farmers isn't a new idea, but it was in Ohio. Greenhouse has stood it's eco-friendly and organic ""ground"" since the get-go. It's one thing to support the local economy in Cleveland, but to also care about it's environment is a real plus. You know, since our river HAS caught on fire before...

This is another restaurant that I love inviting groups of my friends out to. It's the perfect dinner pick for everyone and anyone, whether their vegan, vegetarian, whatever. Your dietary restriction doesn't limit you to boring entrees here. Plus, one of the best deals in town: 3-4 course meals for super reasonable prices. I love doing this because there are so many delectable items on the menu, it's so hard to choose! And trust me, everything I've tried on the menu was superb (and that's a lot of stuff!!)

To top it off, the decor is just beautiful. Dark, natural woods and organic tones and local art adorning the walls. Perfection. There are a variety of different places to sit, whether you'd like to be lofted, sit at a bar-like area, in the window to people watch or outside on their patio -- just another example of how there is something for everyone and every occasion.

Some people complain about the selection of liquor and beer, but I really dig the fact that they carry only organically produced vodkas and such. They hold strong to their beliefs about natural foods. Nothing wrong with that!

Essentially there are only 2 options on the menu, either the 5 course for ($65), or the 7 course tasting for ($85). 
The food was good, but i wasn't wow-ed. What I didn't like was all the dishes were very fish focused (3 of the 7), and they weren't much of my liking except for the first course, yellow tail sashimi - very refreshing and flavorful. Second course was the mushroom which was my favorite dish of the night - tiny diced king oyster mushroom mixed in with flavorful dressing. Third course were shrimps, the meat was cooked perfectly, really soft. Fourth course was salmon with asparagus, this was just okay for me - the salmon was a bit overcooked for my liking. Fifth course was a fried cod, but the cod was soggy being served in the sauce. Sixth course was a veal served with sausage and short rib. The short rib pieces were really tough. The veal was good but nothing special. Surprisingly from that dish I liked the sausage the most. Last course was dessert, some kind of sorbet like ice cream served on top of Mascarpone cheese.

One thing that bothered me slightly was our waiter didnt explain our dishes with much detail unlike the other waiters. When I asked him what the main difference between the 5 and 7 course is (in regards to the food options), he couldn't even say....but he's been serving these dishes all night right?

I saw loreal beauty items, especially that youth code facial moisturizer that's usually about 20 bucks. Despite it being a smaller size, hey, still a fun find.

 This is gold for us one income fam of 6 especially with school age children who need to replenish their school supplies through the year or who have projects. I was excited to find they carried tri-folds as that was exactly what we needed for one of my kids. Not that trifolds are expensive, but the mind game of 99cents...it's a powerful thing.

Lines were super long but moved fairly quick. I've popped in a couple times in the same week and both times had good amount of traffic. Customer service was good enough and overall the store was pretty clean. We had to switch out grocery carts a couple times trying to find a good one but that's all the bitching I got. Lol. 

Highly recommend checking this store out if you are in need of something. If it isn't out your way, it's sure worth the try because they may have what it is you're looking for or equivalent. If not, they may have things you didn't realize you needed or wanted until you see the 99 cent label on it. 

But just a note, not everything is 99cents. They do have items that sell with the price label ENDING in .99.  Also, I notice when the item scans it scans as 1.00.  Not that it's serious but it may matter to other people.

Enjoy!",2017-05-27 07:11:56

On the plus side:
1. Lots of free parking both in front (closest to the theater if you park on the south end of the outdoor lot). Plus there is a parking structure on the few days of rain in Vegas so you can pared and walk to the theater without getting wet.
2. Stadium seating so you can sit behind the guy who is 6'4"" and not have your view blocked. The aisles are wide enough so that you don't have to stand up every time the guy 2 seats away decides he needs to pee at the most dramatic moment in the film.
3. They have days with reduced rates for seeing films. Plus they participate with Movie Pass so I get in without paying anything for the movie (just the monthly rate for Movie Pass - if you don't know about it, check it out right away).
4. Large concession stand area.
5. Lots of restaurants and food stands to get a bite to eat either before or after a film.
6. Lots of screens so they usually have the latest hot film playing
On the negative side:
1. The movie theater is upstairs in the back, so it's a schlep no matter where you park and come in.
2. They don't have the reclining chairs, just over sized leather. Comfortable but not the latest and greatest in movie house seating.

The place was dirty and cramped. Sanitation was questionable at best. Plumbing in the restroom was hit and miss. And the stench of patchouli *still* makes me nauseous. But I was under 21, and coffeehouses were the only places we could nurse a drink for hours and be allowed to hang out.  I had some good times there, made some friends and saw some good bands play our front. Back then, I couldn't help but thing - what would happen if they cleaned this place up?  If they did some basic improvements and made themselves appeal to people with, you know - JOBS? The location is great, the property is great - and the old house has so much character and charm.  It had so much potential - just get rid of the patchouli freaks, raise the bar on food and drink options and the place could be great.
Flash forward.  Willo House is dead and gone. And Hob Nob assumed the location.
I can't believe it's the same house!  It's - well - CLEAN!  Bathrooms (there are 2 now!) are modern and clean and functional. Walls have been sanded and repainted (no longer fear splinters from resting my hand on a door jam.) They still support local artists, and wares are for sale throughout. The baristas are knowledgeable of the products, efficient and friendly!
Thank you, proprietors of Hob Nob - you have brought the vision I had so many years ago to life. Now I know what it could be if the potential were realized - and it is lovely!

That said, Padre's appeals to the lowest common denominator of the hip hop crowd that patronize this restaurant on Sunday afternoons. With a $5 cover, one would think there would be more of a draw than good music and a periodically tight crowd. Unfortunately, the music is where it begins and ends with Padre's. 

Some years ago we ate at Padre's and found the food to be quite good. I don't know what happened in the interim. For a restaurant that is first and foremost a place to get food, and also serves alcohol, to be serving their foodstuff on paper plates is disastrous. Yeah, I understand that you'll be saving a lot of water not having to wash all those plates, but that's something I expected at a bar that serves food as an afterthought--not the other way around. And if a restaurant has a waitstaff, one can reasonably expect an amicable staff with at least an iota of attentiveness towards their clientele. Nope, not here. I do understand that the younger crowd wasn't raised to appreciate waitstaff and probably don't tip, so I kind of understand why you'd rather try to get in some girl's pants than take three consecutive orders. Perhaps you, dear server, are better suited to working in an environment that doesn't require such distractions as doing one's job. And one might mistakenly presume that a restaurant would put its reputation on the line with the food that is served. Not the case at Padre's, whose view of ""modern"" is fast at the expense of flavor. Don't serve me rancid cheese on a stale tortilla and expect me to not be ticked off. I really don't give a hoot that it only costs $2.95; the cover should help absorb the phenomenal cost of serving edible food. Don't even get me started on a Mexican restaurant running out of Pacifico. Really? That's like any number of bars in the Valley running out of Bud Light. I won't tolerate it there, and I certainly won't accept that here. 

The next time I want to hear good hip hop music, feel crowded in my seat and eat sub-par Mexican food, I'll strap on my Walkman, tune it to 98.3, hop on my bike and ride it through the drive through at Taco Bell, because this trip sucked. It sucked!

I don't want to give away too many details but he does work with animals and relies on volunteers whether you know it or not, that's how funny he is.

First: Odd hours. Open at 5 and closing at 9pm? A lot of people don't get done with dinner until 10 or so - closing at 11 would be much better especially in the summer and especially especially on weekends! 

Scoops has about 20 flavors including vegan and sorbet options. I got vanilla, others with us tried the coffee chunk, mint chip, and salted caramel. Of these, the winner seemed to be salted caramel. The rest were fine but just underwhelming. 

Now you might say, 'why the heck did you just get vanilla??' Well, I'd say if you can't do vanilla, something's wrong.  It was just ok. Nothing horrible, but nothing that special either. The ice cream is very rich, reminded me of custard rather than ice cream which is fine because many people love that. 

The decor is somewhat simple, but  I liked the cute idea with the swings in the front of the windows. It's clean and with nice bathrooms so that's a plus.

Upon arrival, the receptionist put us immediately into a room so we didn't have to sit in waiting room which was nice. I filled out paperwork and paid the fee's. immediately after paying, a vet tech came in to sedate my dog while I was signing the credit card machine. Can you imagine signing when your dogs eyes roll back when holding in your arms? Then a few minutes later, the vet came in to administer final drug. I barely even caught her name and she left room. I'm a nurse with a masters degree and would have expected to see the vet first before any drugs were administered to explain process as part of informed consent. Everyone was nice but where is compassion? I did not want any labs or testing for my dog but an explanation on plan of care for process would have been nice for the price I paid in money. I called Friday after I left my job to find out when I could pick up my dog's ashes. The receptionist says that someone called me but my number was out of service. I asked what number they called - they read off the number to my cellphone which I was calling from!! When I pointed this out to receptionist, they said maybe someone dialed wrong number. I also had to ask for my dog's hair and foot prints since it wasn't in bag when I picked her up. I had to also ask for receipt since I was not given one at time of passing. I guess you live and learn, luckily you don't have to put your animal asleep every day but I won't choose this place again.

It's fallen off before, I've had problems with that one as it was made by a pretty careless and painful dentist - the kind that scares you off from coming in for proper care. 

My dentist for my visit was Dr. Amy Tongsiri. She was just so adorably friendly and bubbly! We chatted and felt at ease- I absolutely loved her! Her whole team was so nice and gentle as well when handling my teeth and really mindful of the water/saliva stuff pooling up as I feel like I tend to choke at most dentist chairs. It's so simple, but why don't more dentist put sunglasses on people?! It was nice not to get blinded by the light.

I was hoping that I can just cement it back in, but she recommended that I get a new one made that fit better. I had it from when I was pretty young and my mouth shifted since and it's probably why it popped off again. What also sucks is that I had 2 cavities now - on the tooth in front of this crown and the one behind it. Boo! I do have cavities from when I was a kid, but I've gone a long time as a adult without new ones. 

 It's such bad timing, as I don't have insurance, but will in a few months. It's always a expensive fix to do dental work, but they worked with me to make it as affordable as possible.The cost of this crown was actually cheaper than what my original one cost. Much better made as the material is stronger, has a lifetime warranty in case something does happen and has zero metal like my old one.

Ever have something made, had to have a temporary and then come back two weeks? What's great is they have a lab downstairs and for some items can be made in a few hours and put in same day! I went to grab some lunch and came back to have my crown put in. I actually had Dr My Tran put my crown in and he is how I found out about this place. I met him and his wife years ago at a event so I've always had it in the back of my head to come here.

The office is also run impeccably well. I appreciated that my actual appointment time is when I get in to be seen as I've been to offices that was perpetually 1 hour behind. The front of the staff and billing were all friendly too. When I came back a few hours later to place my crown, they were on it of informing the dental team and I was back having it placed in no time.

Let's face it, dentist get a bad rap. It only takes one bad trip as it is a pretty vulnerable experience that is frankly scary for many people. When someone is all up in your grill, it's important to feel they care about you. I'm not scared or hesitant to come back here. This is one of the most pleasant dentist experiences I've had.

Upon walking in a group of ladies all at once asked us if we would likevtoo be seated, feeling overwhelmed I said Yes.... she walked us to our table. 

I was starving and I already knew what I wanted.  Our waitress was tall as a stripper pole a killer smile with Ruby red lipstick.....

She rattled of some drinks specials in honor of Prince which I thought was a great idea. 

I ordered the sea bass. Delicious!!!! It  was moist and flaky with a bed of amazing creaminess covering the bottom. I had no clue what is was but boy did it taste good. 

My girlfriends had the jambalaya. It was the biggest bowl I had ever seen and it taste like you were transported to New Orleans. BEADS PLEASE.....

It had big chucks of shrimp, chiicken and sausage. I could'nt help sticking my fork in their bowls to get more. It was so good with the hint of heat at the end of each bite. 
Yessss! Am I on Bourbon Street...

We decided to get extra greedy and order the hot chocolate cake with whipped cream.... have I lost my mind? MAYBE...but I was worth it. 

Better get there early on Saturdays around 4pm for dinner. This place gets crowded pretty fast.

Although I think the pizza is a little smaller, it's also cooked in a different way. Instead of a conveyor belt oven, it's actually a fire oven. Extra crispy though and different texture. 

The taste is pretty good and on par with Pizza studio. I think there may be more ingredients here, but I couldn't put as much ingredients on because of the smaller size. What's impressive was that the pizza cooked in 2 minutes as opposed to 5-10 minutes at Pizza Studio.

Well, the prices are about the same so I guess either place would be fine. I think there are more Fired Pie places and only one Pizza Studio in Phoenix area. So like both places, I give them 4 stars for fast delicious unlimited toppings pizza!",2015-11-07 18:17:32

The best meat are the espetada de picanha and picanha grelhada. The meat is not the tenderest I've had but they are tasty nonetheless.  My least favourite entree is the stroganoff de contrafile.  It tastes closer to a curry than the real thing in Brazil.

i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and Cajun fries. Wasn't a big fan of the buffalo chicken. i guess i prefer more sauce and flavor. It seemed like too much chicken and bun, with not enough flavor. i liked the Cajun fries for my side and they were a generously sized portion.

About eight years ago I was driving our five year old RX-300 from Seattle to Chicago, so one of our kids could use it at college.  We were outside of Bismarck, ND when all the lights on the dash lit up warning us that the car was about to fail.  The nearest dealership at that time was in St Paul, MN.  Yeah, I know LOL.

So after calling Lexus for advice, off we drove very nervously to MN.  We arrived safely around 5pm and waited nearly three hours for them to look at the car.  It was confirmed that the RX had some sort of unknown oil sludge build-up in the engine and that the engined needed to be replaced!  Replaced? Eesch!

We were asked various questions on where we had our service work done.  After verifing that we had all of our work done at the dealership in WA state, they offered us a Loaner.  Ummm I said, we're driving on to Chicago.  Not to worry, they would flatbed the car to us when it was repaired and to keep the Loaner.  Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

Now, that story is eight years old and it reminds me of our current experience with our ES.  Seems the NAV & bluetooth link doesn't want to accept the new iPhone.  Yeah, I know, Apple right? LOL. After several attempts by us and the dealer, they are now replacing the entire system. Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

We have owned other cars and have spent lots of $$$ with replair work, but no one backs up their cars like Lexus.  No one. Peace of mind? Priceless!",2013-12-09 20:55:49

I get up the only teller (Chantal, I believe that was the spelling of her name), and tell her I want to make a withdrawal. She prints the receipt, and basically just throws it towards me. Not a menacing throw, but not what I'd expect a professional teller to do. She then counts out the money I requested, and throws that in my general direction also!

I look at her, trying to see what her problem is.  Nothing obvious. I just shake my head in disappointment, and walk away.

I was so excited when I saw they were opening up a new one at the Waterfront. Party because it will make my weekly trips to Target that much better! 

I should say that it's not only a Chinese buffet, but also serves sushi as well! I wouldn't say it's the best sushi I've ever had, but you watch them making it in front of you, so you at least know it's fresh. I look for very certain things in my Chinese buffets, which I think you all should. Cleanliness, fresh looking and selection. I feel like they have it all. They have a large selection of sushi, fried food (who doesn't love cheese wonton's!) and traditional Chinese. They also have a Mongolian BBQ where you can make your own plate of raw food an they cook it in front of you. It's pretty tasty, and I try to convince myself that's the healthy way to go (even though I know it's not!).

It didn't interest bf, so he went with a classic burrito filled w/ pork (pastor).

Since I had been hibernating, I didn't make it out here until the yelp event in April. On an unseasonably warm day, Yelp hosted an event on the patio. The food was good and the drinks were strong. I couldn't wait to come back. It was an all around good time.

Our second visit to Ruru's happened a couple weekends ago. The weather was starting to turn to fall and we came in to celebrate. We sat on their beautiful patio and shared a couple plates. The patio was bustling with people, lots of groups, tvs were on, seemed like a great atmosphere. Like another reviewer said - the queso is good but runny. I would order it again. I ordered 3 tacos, but only 2 arrived and I was only charged for 2 - I tried one of the steak ones (gristly) and one of the carnitas (seemed cooked, chopped, and re-fried on a flat top). I got a side of guac which was watery for some reason - maybe because of the tomatoes in it? Not a fan. Fiance got both chicken tacos and the mahi taco. He seemed to like his more than I liked mine. We each ordered a cocktail and on Sundays they are half price which was a plus. Cocktails were good and strong - no watered down drinks here just because they were running a special. Our server was very nice but we had to ask him several times for napkins which should be a default table setting at a place where you eat with your hands. And whatever happened to my third taco?

I got the #7 which included a hotdog (on a burger roll) and a little burger. The hot dog was tasty, the burger was OK. It came with a salad but the only options were using the oil & vinegar on the table. I love oil & vinegar so that was a-ok for me. 

I'm guessing this was kind of a tourist trap, as my meal was $14, a little steep for the diner-esque cuisine. They give you a little jar of pickles though, (for your burger) and I love pickles so I totally ate half the jar.

Luckily, this Mesa location was only @ 5 miles away, and they were open until 11:30pm that night, so it worked out even better for us. 

Admission was only $1 per person on Halloween evening for those in costume, which we all were.  We still had to pay regular price for the skate rental ($3.50), but at $4.50 per person, it was a great deal.

The skates were ok; the wheels felt a little ""off"" but I was able to work with them. Nice rink and the music selection was good; they played a mixture of current pop hits to throwback R&B and  pop 80s.  

I'm not sure if it was because it was later in the evening or because it was Halloween, but there weren't a lot a kids, which is a major plus in my book.  

The girls enjoyed the snack bar. They ordered pizza, pretzels, cotton candy, churros, and Icees.  Prices were decent and not too over-priced. 

Also, there was a police officer on-duty and standing outside in the parking lot when we arrived.  I still feel new to PHX.  I don't know the areas and neighbors outside of where I live and work, so I don't know if the security was due to the 'hood, or just general practice.  Either way, I did feel secure knowing that someone was watching over the cars that late in the evening. 

My biggest complaint here is that the employees' friends were on the rink doing some dangerous stunts (flips, handstands, etc while on their skates!), pretty much the whole night.  It posed a risk to other skaters, especially the younger kids, and it encouraged younger kids to mimic the behavior.

The rye bread is soft, delicious and has a good crust, the meats are plentiful, juicy and piled high, the cheese is tasty.  Its pretty much damn near a perfect sandwich.   My wife always orders the BLT on rye and that always comes out fantastic too.  They must use 10-12 slices of bacon on this monster.

Their pho is incredibly good. Like, well it's perfectly salty, the flavour is perfect (with the added lime and sriracha of course). There's always a generous amount of meat, which I find isn't the in case in other pho places.

They have a incredibly long menu. It will take maybe 10 visits to savor the full selection. For first few visits, I suggest sticking to things you can't find in other Indian places in Madtown.

RESPONSE TO NICOLE'S LOVELY COMMENT

Thank you so much for proving my point. I am so sorry, I didn't know I had a deadline of less than 3 days to get back to you. 

I mean I am just at the ready to give you more of my time and money to waste. Are you kidding me? I am a very busy Mom who does not need to drop everything to answer to you.

In this day and age you need to make sure you have your facts straight because everyone has proof of what is going on during their day. I can upload images of text messages I sent during my appointment proving times, what happened and that no, there was no lunch and no children at it. 

I am not the type of person to let someone take advantage of me as a customer and then try to slander my credibility when I speak up about a bad experience. 

I couldn't figure out how you had such high reviews but I think I get it now you bully people into changing reviews.

Here are my responses to your numbered inaccuracies. Proof can be provided if anyone would like. 

1. ok, I think a few numbers down you will find this is not true. 

2. I was happy to find you guys until I had a bad hair cut, a terrible second visit and half a head not correctly colored. I didn't realize this until I did my own hair..when I got home. 

3. My appointment was at 10 am so check your facts. Your front desk girl and my hair dresser and a few others were talking about it as I walked in. It's obviously your word against mine but I don't care. I know it was broken the second I walked in. Did they talk about how an employee of yours was nice enough to get fans for all of us...probably something the owner should have bought etc. Why would it even matter? 

4. Spent time in the back? I think you are mistaking me for somebody else. I know she sat me back there for 10 minutes but the rest of my time was spent in her chair getting foiled, or under the dryer when the waiting wasn't working. 10 minutes vs. 4 hours...wow you are right. What am I complaining about. 

5. In order for my daughters to tell you they loved their hair, that would mean that they were with me the second time. They were not so past tense...??? So confused. 

6. $20 for a hair cut is fine but you should probably let people know that you are not washing kids hair. This is a new one for me. She is 11 not 3. I would expect her hair to be washed. Not only that it still had dead ends. She didn't look different. 

7. Now I know you said my stylist remembers everything in great detail. So I am not sure what happened here. But my girls were NOT with me during my second visit. My appointment was on October 9th. at 10 am. You see they go to school. So it's not possible for them to have been with me. I would go so far as to get records from their school to prove the lies you are telling. 

As for eating lunch, I have text messages with dates and TIMES to my Mother asking her to please bring me food because my hair was taking forever and I was starving. 

She couldn't leave because they were replacing her windshield. Again...more than happy to upload the image of the texts for anyone to see. In fact I am looking at them now. 

So NO I did not hang around a hot salon with wet hair with my 2 daughters eating lunch talking about the plans I had for the day. 

I ran out as fast as I could to try and make the appointment I almost missed, with wet hair starving! All the while my kids were in school...learning. 

8. I pre-booked my appointment because I am a loyal client and that is what I do every time. At the time I was annoyed at the situation but my full annoyance didn't peak until I saw my hair in it's full terrible glory. 

Please remember at the time I was annoyed that the salon owner didn't provide fans, an apology or a call to warn clients. My stylist did her best to handle it. That is why I will still not give her name. 

9. You act like I have no idea how long it takes for high quality highlights. It did not take her that long last time and she styled my hair. I have no problem paying the money...it's what I get for it that is the problem.

The food was served with good timing, we didn't have to wait for drinks - it seemed like the timing of the food and drinks was perfect / seamless. I noticed that the portions of food was inconsistent but other than that I have no complaints. Everything was hot and didn't seem to sit on the pass. I hate it when you order something and it arrives and it looks like it sat on the pass for 20 minutes. Big pet peeve of mine. Anyway, all the food was tasty and served fresh at an appropriate temperature. I think the meat balls were my favorite dish. They were tender, well seasoned and piping hot. The charcuterie platter was small for $20 but this goes back to that comment I made about inconsistent portions because I ordered it the time before last and the portions were really generous. Also, most of the plates can be shared by 3, but for some reason the charcuterie platter was to be shared by 2.

O & G has a charming, Paris-like cafe feel. Wood tables, freshly baked goods on display, delicious smells and classic but funky decor.

If you're looking for take-out, that's also an option and you stand in the same line to place an order.

They have about 9 sandwiches written on chalkboards above the food displays - my memory is failing me, but they were all classic with a twist. Chicken with pesto and roasted red peppers, caramelized onions with some sort of meat....something spicy. My apologies for the vague descriptions, but I guarantee they were delicious and fresh.  They also have an array of fresh salads, fruit salads, and  REALLY good fresh breads & spreads. I had the ricotta cheese with a yummy olive oil and parsley, cherry tomatoes and warm bread with a garlic-y glaze. It was delicious, and great to share.

We also tried the baked goods (how could we not), and tried a butter croissant, banana loaf, and a mixed fruit and nut muffin. All fresh, all delish.

But when my brother came to town recently, my husband and I decided to splurge and hit the PT for dinner. (It helped that I had $100 comp to use!)

We started with a pitcher of sangria and an order of bacon-wrapped jalapenos. For our entrees, my husband had the carnitas; I had the chopped salad; and my brother had six street tacos (one each of several varieties). The pitcher was pricey at $48, but everything else was $1 off when we used my player's card.

I LOVE that chopped salad, a nice blend of lettuce, turkey, hominy, and pepitas. I always thought they used jicama as well, but when I read the menu more closely, I saw that it was apple. A weird choice, but tasty! My husband loved his carnitas as well. He asked for no cilantro, so they brought his big chunks of pork with onions, tomatoes, and guac on the side. This let him create his own soft tacos with delicious cilantro-free toppings. (There was a LOT of meat there, too, so he had a nice leftover meal.) My brother was not too impressed with his tacos, however. Didn't care for the tortillas (too thick) and was not a fan of the fillings (although he ate all of the fillings and left the tortillas behind).

The salsa, as usual, was pretty bland, and the sangria seemed a lot sweeter than in years past. But my husband and I both enjoyed our food. And the price was right! After using our $100 comp, we owed less than $2 (pre-tip)!

I will still return for happy hour, but it's nice to know that other items on the menu are just as tasty as the cheaper offerings. Just a little more expensive ...",2016-07-17 17:15:24

Can't wait to get back here!  So glad it is convenient for us uptown workers!!!  :-D",2012-02-03 16:37:12

The interiors are humble but not rich, though definitely clean! The restaurant seems to be family run and friendly. There isn't much of a Greek ambience other than a painting on one of the walls. The menu is surprisingly combines American and Greek cuisines! It's also a hefty menu so take time to go through all the dishes and ask for clarifications. Pita/gyro is always good option when you want to go safe. The dishes were served quick and they tasted alright. To sum it all up, it's not really a restaurant you would to take your date to and neither is it a restaurant to go through the Greek experience. If you want to just grab a quick bite of a Pita or gyro, this is the place. Other than that, don't expect a lot!",2017-11-19 17:59:06

I usually get something dark on the rocks or a vodka soda when I'm at a bar, but I'm not gonna lie, I enjoy a good cocktail prepared by a knowledgable mixologist--which is what Velveteen Rabbit is all about.  They've got a wide selection of beer and a full bar, but you'd be crazy not to try a cocktail mixed by the expert hands and palates of the talented folks behind the bar. 

I came here with a large group of friends on a Saturday night around 9:30ish. Good crowd-- a little hipstery, but what do you expect from the middle of the arts district?  The bar was uniquely decorated, with a folk art feel.  There were actually paintings hung up on the walls that were being sold, as if it were a gallery.  The couches were all pretty and velvety.  There's a cute patio area to sip your drinks and smoke, since there's no smoking in the bar.  The bar area got crowded fast, but it wasn't too difficult to find a seat elsewhere.  Chill, laid back music was playing, nothing too loud or obnoxious.  

My favorite cocktails of the night include the (1)Crucifix in a Death hand--which kind of reminded me of a really good Manhattan; (2)God's Gift--a tasty, citrus, sparkling cocktail; (3)The Moon is Rising--a cocktail served with a little chocolate chip cookie; and (4)a cognac sparkling cocktail that the bartender, Alex, had fixed me up--it was good!  Don't be afraid to let them make you something!

Definitely enjoyed myself there!  For $8 a cocktail, you really have nothing to lose!  Can't wait to go back!",2013-12-30 06:28:37

what has made the effect of those things diminish for me is their overbreading of the fish and its subsequent greasiness.  ive always felt a little queasy after having eaten here.  the fries are great, the accompanying sauces tasty, the choices varied but this important aspect wanting.

They called us back to offer us a $2 discount on our next order.

What next order?

All in all if only slightly above average pho cannot be delivered with what it is served with in every Pho restaurant from Saigon to Toronto, than quite franky it is too unreliable to waste your money on

For the most unique TONGUE Thrilling Numbing and Spicy food this is it! Honest to God the Hot Pot is a FULL SIZE COOKING POT filled with chopped up chicken on the bone with skin  (if you order chicken) vegetables such as bean sprouts cabbage , hot broth herbs , oil  and spices and lots of those Szechwan Peppercorns that have an illegal drug like effect that makes you crave it. This dish was not like anything we've had anywhere else. I do understand that hot pots are more elaborate at places that specialize with them but you do the the hot pot taste just not the whole experience.

Service was better this time but still not professional, the staff was laughing at my husband eating the hot pot with the fork they gave him. (we were not given chop sticks) He forked out the chicken pieces and vegetables and ate them on the plate. I guess most people just put the whole piece of chicken in mouth and use the plate to spit out the bones.

I had the water boiled fish that I tried to order last time, it was very good and lighter than the water boiled chicken I was given last time, both those dishes seemed very mild and far less tongue Thrilling compared to the Chicken hot pot but they were also flavorful and were lightly tongue thrilling.

We were a group of approx 12 people so we had 2 tables reserved - if you have a group I highly recommend making a reservation and getting there early! Our reservation was for 7pm and I realized later on why it was so necessary - this place gets PACKED on the weekend. 

As for the food we ordered 3 different times and each time got around 6 sausages, curry wvrst style (sauce on the side), I think this is the way to go in a group because I got to try almost every sausage on the menu! I think in a smaller group it's nice to get a full sausage on the bun because I like the toppings (sauerkraut and jalapenos please!) but with a group this worked out really well. My favourites were (in order): TAMWORTH , BERKSHIRE, KRANJSKA (tastes like a super high quality hot dog!), BOEREWORS, CHORIZO. We tried others but those were tops, I did try Bison and Kangaroo but wasn't thrilled on either - the kangaroo was especially dry, it's too lean of a meat. 

We also had orders of plain duck fat fries, and the dirty duck fat fries. I loved the dirty fries, curry sauce and jalapenos were so good and the fries managed to stay crispy! 

The beer selection is intimidating but the bartender was very helpful and even gave me a couple of samples. I settled on the Pilsner Urquell for the night and really enjoyed it, nice easy compliment to all of that meat. 

My only complaints are: very crowded - I couldn't believe there was a line out the door from about 8pm-11pm, and the crowd resulted in a very loud and VERY hot room. I understand it's winter but I didn't need to sweat on top of my meat sweats.

I went to The Perch with a few of my girlfriends from out of town to grab a drink and appetizers before dinner. We took a seat at the bar; I got the garlic aioli fries and a Bloody Mary. 

The garlic aioli fries came out freshly fried; hot, crunchy, and very flavorful. Lots of garlic which I can't complain as I'm a huge fan of any food involved with heavy garlic. Delish!

The Bloody Mary was neat because you get to build your own. They give you a cup poured of any vodka you prefer, a decanter of tomato juice, a side of horseradish, hot sauce, and olives. What a fun and original concept to create a Bloody Mary to your liking at a restaurant... you don't get to do that every day!

Our bartender was very attentive to our needs, however, he didn't smile. It bothered me a little. I don't expect bartenders to be cheesing constantly, but try to look like you're enjoying your time working even a tiny bit...

I arrived early and sat at the bar and met Letty herself. It looked like there were 3 people working out front and only one real server. The other person appeared to be only a hostess but was helping out where she could.

The place was busy and Letty informed us that it was busier than normal because they had an unannounced group show up. We were also informed that their food order comes the next day so they were running out of a lot of things. It was nice to know that before ordering.

Things got a little odd after that. Usually drink orders are taken before the meal ordering but here it was done at the same time and drinks took 45 minutes to arrive after we were initially seated.  

For a meal, I ordered the Country Fried chicken and side salad. When my meal arrived I received fries instead of a side salad but I was too involved in conversation at the table to realize what was missing until halfway into my meal. The chicken was delicious and very tender. It was fried boneless chicken breast so it was almost healthy.  The sausage gravy on top was fantastic and I just wanted to smother everything with it including the fries. Unfortunately, I devoured it too quickly to do so.

Other people at the table had fish and chips, the honey pecan chicken, pimento cheese burger, garden burger and a few other items. The chicken is what seemed to stand out here.

For dessert, I ordered the berry crisp which was had good flavors that married well together.

The price is decent and although some items don't quite make it to your table, they have no problem giving you another sheet to fill out and to order from. You're best to confirm whether or not more is coming and ask for a page accordingly. It's really not that big of a deal when you think about it... 

The reason why I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars is because they remember their customers. My friend Christina R is gluten free and has to use a different soya sauce then the one they serve. Every time we visit, they whip out her personal soya sauce bottle and bring it to the table before a hello is even exchanged. They are that good!",2015-04-02 18:03:10

I purchased my car from Berge and also get it serviced occasionally here as well.

My sales person who isn't there anymore(Blake) was mediocre at best and I've seen that he has posted negative reviews on their Facebook which is so childish! I wish I would have purchased from someone else but I guess I'm happy with my car (2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid) so who cares, right?

I think the service department has been my favorite and I hope that they keep it up! I typically work with Sergio Diaz and he is always a pleasure. He's super friendly and when you talk to him, he treats you like a friend. 

I called all of the other Ford dealerships in the area and asked if they were able to get me in and out with my car and all of them said that they were not available to get me in and out. With a job, and a life, I cannot spend multiple days dealing with my car. I called Chapman, Bell, then Berge and they came through telling me that it wouldn't be a problem at all to get me in.

I did end up having more issues than what they thought originally so I did end up in a rental but it was seamless and was able to come back after work the next day with my car washed and ready to go for me.

Since I just wanted to try them out, I asked if it was possibly to purchase a slice even though it was outside lunch hours. The lady taking the order asks her cooks if there's slices left, to which they did. I'm relieved, but I'm worried my food won't be as good since it didn't sound like it would be freshly made. I wait about 10 minutes and they bring my pizza to me. You can see for yourself in the picture... definitely NY style pizza!! It was thin, super cheesy, and *surprise* super greasy. What pizza is grease free and tasted decent anyways? The pizza was good and I wish they were closer to work since their lunch deals sound pretty awesome!! I wouldn't say their pizza tasted mind blowing or anything, but I wouldn't oppose having it again. I did give 3 out of 5 stars since the table I was sitting on smelled like they wiped it with something that should've been washed.

I coworker had posted photos earlier this year, spending hours in line to take her daughter to Pink's Hot Dogs in LA. I asked why wait in an insanely long line for Pink's, when she can get better product at Ted's. She'd never heard of Ted's, so I made it a mission to take her for lunch.
It was a super hungry day for me - I had an Italian Sausage with a side of a regular dog. The coworker had a jumbo dog, and we shared onion rings.
The onion rings were amazing. All onion rings should be Ted's onion rings! Thin sliced, crispy breading - clearly made fresh to order. 
My Italian Sausage was perfectly seasoned and had just the right level of spice. Topped with deli mustard and cooked peppers and onions. I could not have asked for a more delicious lunch.
In hindsight, I should have eaten the regular dog first. It was tasty. Incredibly enjoyable. But with the flavor of the Italian Sausage still on my tongue, it was a little on the boring side. Truly, nothing wrong with it at all - and had I reversed the order of consumption, I would have loved both equally. My fault, not Ted's!

Their lunch specials (M-Th or F, 11am-3pm) are the best - you can choose chicken, beef, or veggies with an entree and prices are determined by choices of meat - chicken is $5.99 and I forget the rest. Thai Iced Tea is $1.00 during their lunch special too which can't be beat.

My favorite entrees are the Pad Thai or the Drunken Noodle. Yellow curry isn't bad either.

When it's not lunch special time, entrees are pretty pricey. The pad thai and/or pad-see-ew can be at least $9.99 but they open until 4am-6am which means they are always an option to eat at.

Perfect weather means spending time outside, and that always means a trip to NoDa. And NoDa means good (cheap) food. I want to branch out and try all of the street's fabled offerings but today it was back to a tried and true favorite after a long winter of hibernation: Cabo Fish Taco. They have never done me wrong.

Over the winter they seem to have expanded. A second room has doubled their capacity. And today they needed it all. We were squeezed in amongst the most diverse crowd you'll find in Charlotte - a refreshing reminder that the world is more interesting than the Uptown bar scene. You'll find that all over NoDa, but here especially. I was a little nervous that with the expansion, and with the beautiful day bringing out so many people, the staff might be overwhelmed. Our waitress was a little harried, but she managed to efficiently serve a dozen tables - polite, even if she didn't have time to chat. 

Per Bill F's suggestion I went for the blackened mahi-mahi signature taco, and it was awesome. Awesome. That white cilantro sauce is to die for.

5:30pm rolls around. Get another call.  They're at my condo again. (I'm still at work). He grumbled slightly and said they'd have to make it again.

6:45 rolls around.  Nothing. I call the restaurant after a few minutes to make sure there wasn't something weird going on- and our buzzer rings while I'm on the phone.  He's here!

Head down.  Order isn't complete.  A whole pizza is missing.  He told me I only ordered two pizzas (incorrect) until he actually looked at the receipt.  He then proceeded to indirectly blame me for the the fact that three poor drivers have had to bear the blistering cold to bring me my pizzas and that the restaurant doesn't even look at the time on the receipt- just what's being ordered.  I didn't understand how that was my problem and I refused to a) be spoken to like that and b) pay for an incomplete order.  I told him to take it back to the restaurant because I didn't want it anymore.

I went back to my apartment and called the restaurant and explained what happen, and the nice lady put the owner on for me to speak with.  I told him what had gone on and even though I really didn't want the pizza anymore, he said he'd deliver it to me himself and pretty much offered me anything extra I wanted- I told him he could surprise me with a dessert.

Well he did.  He brought the pizzas, 4 desserts and some calamari (holy crap) to me personally and apologized for the mix-up.  I felt horrible for him for having to deal with this, but was very thankful to receive such great, personal service.  It shows how much pride he really takes in his restaurant and that says a lot.

The food was incredible- I'm actually in physical pain from eating so much of it so fast- it was that good.  I will order from them again in the future (if they'll let me) but will probably never order in advance again as that seems to be where the main issue was.

I was invited to Cibo Yorkville's preview dinner. The location is great and the space is beautiful. I thought that the service was wonderful and overall I had a good experience.

I think all the tables got random menu items to sample. We started with a beautiful charcuterie board with a nice selection of meats and cheeses. My friend and I both enjoyed it a lot.

For mains, we were given a roasted chicken and an artichoke pizza to sample. The roasted chicken was well cooked, even though it looked almost a little undercooked around the leg. Could be a tad more flavourful... But we both enjoyed the veggies and potatoes on the side.

As for the pizza, my friend found a piece of hair in her slice, so that sort of ruined it for both of us.

For dessert, we were served a delicious tiramisu- the portion size was very generous. We were very pleased.

One complaint I did have is that the drinks were very watered down (I had a mojito and a sangria). But I'm not sure if it's because this is just a preview dinner. This is one area that I think they can improve.

I think my cupcake came out to almost $4, which I think is a little steep.  However I will be back when I have a cupcake craving.  I hope they will offer more cupcakes selection as it gets busier.....",2012-04-01 14:43:01

Sprouts is downstairs the absolutely adorable organic grocery in a beautiful mid century building. It is in the basement- which is weird to see in this area of NC.

There is a little outdoor area. It is decorated exactly how you want a place like this to be decorated. They have a good thing going

I ordered there hummus wrap. I think they stuffed it with too many sprouts, but I can't really complain because the restaurant is named sprouts. 

I definitely want to come back for juice and to try out the menu a little more.

Looking at their menu, I thought they were not competing on price, they must be competing on quality. I realize what they are really doing is offering unusual sushi. I ordered spring rolls, sushi pizza, green dragon roll, sushi sliders and a kimchi/beef roll. (two very adventurous choices and two sushi choices, while non-traditional but more common sushi choices) 

I had no idea what to expect with sushi sliders - they are blocks of rice with a wedge of salmon inside. Unusual but not bad. The Kimchi roll was a disaster, really does not taste good. While I knew this roll would have been hard to pull off, I gotta say as someone who makes his own bulgogi and homemade kimchi, both were worse than I make myself. I had to throw some of this out, which is a big minus for me. The Sushi pizza was actually very cheap at 4.50, but it wasn't covered in topping. It was cut in fours making it impossible to manipulate with chopsticks. The Green Dragon Roll and Spring Rolls were perfectly fine, and gave me hope that many of their other items might be adequate. Having to throw away sushi because I didn't like it, would be enough for this to merit one star, but I have to concede its a highly experimental roll so I knew I might not like it. I would choose someone else for either price or quality.

I would not recommend it and would not order from this place again.",2015-10-23 23:50:03

After my second visit Beckett's Table is quickly becoming one of my favorite Phoenix places to dine. The restaurant has a high-end feel to it but the prices are very reasonable. At first glance one might not think the menu is very adventurous but you would be missing the point. What Beckett's Table does is something we should all do which is: do your very best version of whatever it is you are doing. In this case it means not shocking everyone with exotic ingredients or wild ideas. Having amazing mashed potatoes and stuffing is almost always better than some alchemist chef experimenting on you. There is a reason we all love simple comfort food like popcorn and macaroni and cheese. The reason is that we know it will be good. If someone said ""hey have you tried my new chili pepper and sardine flavor mac?"", you might be curious but it is hardly anything you sit around hungry for. There is a quaint theme to many of the menu items which is the inclusion of bacon on nearly everything. Worry not though vegetarians Beckett's will not leave you hungry. My veggie wife was able to get the grilled cheese and tomato soup bacon-free with no fuss.

And since the beginning of their sushi bar, they have grown to the space next door! My place to be...the lounge.

So these are the reasons why I love Pisces:

1. If you're like me and have a hard time thinking of a drink you want, you can definitely leave it up to the bartender here. They can make something random and it will be awesome! 
2. Awesome service. I've never had a bad experience in this department.
3. Want to eat in the lounge? You sure can! 
4. They have a jelly fish tank. Yeah, A jelly fish tank.
5. Live music on Saturday nights in the lounge. 
6. TV's are always on the sports channels. (Even when Bobcats are playing against the Heats)
7. Good beers on draft.
8. (But honestly in the end it always comes back to alcohol/mixed drinks.)
9. And this place well, is the place to go for a mixed drinks with friends. That's probably the only reason I come out to bars is to try their creation and specialty drinks. Or else, I would be home drinking scotch.

So, yes. Check this place out. Anthony Hamilton did the other night, so be like a celeb (or just have fun) and watch the jellyfish go round and around the tank and get yo drink on!",2013-04-11 17:36:17

It's a cash only establishment, so be prepared to bring a few coins.

I went with my son.  We definitely had to have scramblers (although everything else looked fantastic).  He had the bacon cheddar scrambler.  I wanted to go rogue, so I got a scrambler with corned beef hash (in place of the potatoes and $1.25 more) with bacon and cheddar.  You can get gravy on the omelet or on the side - I'd advise to get it on the side, so you can fold it in or dunk one of your two pieces of toast in.

With the potatoes (or corned beef hash in my case), they come to your table appearing as if they're six-egg omelets - massive is an understatement!  

On the table is Vietnamese version of Sriracha (Double Chicken Brand, I believe) and the customary blend of salt and pepper.  

The taste is incredible.  I really enjoyed it with the hash rather than the fried potatoes.  Their hash is deliciously chunky and spicy (it tastes like it has a chili and maybe a bit of a curry thing going on). The eggs were a perfect topper with what was likely a 1/2 a lb. of shredded cheddar.  

The calorie counter died on the way to the table - I think I swallowed it with the corned beef.  

With water, I had coffee.  It was the standard diner coffee, but maybe a little bit weaker than some.  My son stuck with water.

The bill for approximately 10,000 calories of goodness  (remember, the counter was lost in the carnage, so I may be a bit off) - only $16.87!!!   As far as calories (and saturated fat) per dollar - this is has to be one of the deals around.  In addition, the food (taste and preparation) was perfect for our cravings.

Their lunch specials are well priced: $10 for a small entree (my guy likes the stuffed cabbage rolls) with a choice of side (their hummus is great!) and pita bread. Their bread is noteworthy because it's made fresh in house, super-soft and chewy.

I waited ten minutes in front of the register to order my food and it was my turn. 

It took them for ever to bring my food. And they brought my food and my wife's drink. Making her wait and have her drink cool down. 

They were horribly understaffed.

So it's mlk day and I'm guessing the owner didn't expect to be so busy. He was kind enough to bring a dessert for free and apologized sincerely for the way our morning went. We never complained about it so he was aware of it.

We thought that was a great idea! They comped that, so all we paid for was our drinks. 

The drinks weren't pricey at all, and during happy hour it was even cheaper. Which is nothing!!

I also asked if he can check the oil level.  (luckily it was ok).

Smog check went well , did not charge me for the ATF and I was on my way to the DMV.

I was really impressed because I was expecting to be charged extra.  
Where nowadays do you find someone doing something to be nice. 

I will definitely keep this place in mind if the place I usually go to messes up.  (I'll yelp them later).

Half the time good service, the other not so good. Nothing bothers me more at a restaurant than a long wait when the place is dead.  I totally understand if service lags when the place is hopping, but not when it's quiet.  My last two time I've been here I got the same service.  Took a while to be seated and once seated, took forever to take my order.  Once you get your order in, the food doesn't take too long. So, you can't blame the cooks.  However, my bill arrived about 5 minutes after I got my food.  Talk about poor service. Take forever to seat you and get your order, but can't wait to kick you out.  This wasn't a one off thing.  Happened my last two visits here.  I would give this place less stars, but my belly left satisfied everytime.

Sake Rok is fun. It's vibrant. It's lively. It's delicious. It's just overall a great place to be. If I wanted to recommend a place to be for an occasion, Sake Rok would be perfect. 

The staff break out in song and dance every now and then. There's an MC (shoutout to Jonnis--I love you and you're amazing) who interacts with the guests and really makes the place alive. If you're lucky, you may even get pulled up to dance :)

Food - 5/5 I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the food here. There's definitely a unique touch to it, such as the edamame and the peppers you're given in the beginning. The sashimi tastes fresh and melts in my mouth. The sushi rolls were all amazing! I had one dish that involved mushrooms & steak and it was ah-may-zingggg. Overall, all loved the food!

Drinks - 5/5 Okay the cocktails are typical strip price so don't be scared. It tastes amazing. The staff really gave me great recommendations, drink after drink!

Staff - 5/5 I really can't complain. Everyone was helpful and friendly while also being energetic and fun :)

It was the service and the asinine policies that plunge this into one-star territory, but I'll start with the food: it was a solid three star experience, no more no less. Appetizers consist of spring rolls and fairly bland, if not entirely unsatisfying, fried things. There were several soups that sounded good but that only came in a serving for two. I've seen this at other Asian restaurants and I don't get it. If you can make two bowls, why can't you make one? (If you read on, you'll see that ""We could but we won't"" is kind of their motto.

All the appetizers we ordered were, I thought, a very good value proposition, even if they were nothing to write home about. We (a party of four) got one order of spring rolls (fresh, crisp, and tasty), one order of crab Rangoon (an above average rendition of a dish that I'm not a huge fan of) and one order of curry puffs, which were described as being like a potato samosa, which they were, but with a bit more fried crust and a bit less potato than I would have liked. Portions of all appetizers were good, prices were reasonable, and the flavor was ok. 

Then we got our entrees. I had a garlic shrimp dish that I ordered at a 3 on their four star spiciness scale. It wasn't as spicy as I expected, and the plate was dominated by broccoli, but it's something I could see eating again. The couple that was with us ordered a mango curry that I really liked, but that was a good bit hotter than my 3-star spicy shrimp, even though they ordered it at 1 star. My friend got a 1-star dish that consisted of a small amount of several proteins and a lot of bland vegetables. Nothing was particularly great, but I wouldn't say that I was dissatisfied with the meal. 

After dinner my friend stepped out for a cigarette, and I went to keep him company. When we got back, the couple had received their check. Then my friend and I were given a check for the combined total of our meals. We asked them to please split it and were told: ""We can't do that. We already split it once, and we cannot split a check more than once."" 

I've never heard of or encountered this policy anywhere else, but apparently that's how they roll over at Lao-Laan Xang. They repeatedly said ""we can't do that.""  Yes, you can. Other businesses do it. You choose not to to save a few bucks. This is an idiotic, obnoxious policy, but I'd probably still be writing a 2-star review if it weren't for the interaction I had with the waiter as we were leaving.

I politely and quietly said to him, ""It's not your fault, but could you please tell the owner that this policy cost them my business. I live in the neighborhood and order a lot of takeout, but I don't think I'll be back. He's lost my business.""

Here's how this conversation could and should have gone:

Waiter: I'm very sorry to hear that. I'll relay your concerns.""
Me: Thanks. Have a nice night. 

Here's how it went:
Me: ... could you please tell him that he's lost my business. 
Waiter: ACTUALLY, this restaurant isn't owned by a man. 
Me: Oh, then can you let HER know. 
Waiter: ACTUALLY, it's owned by two women. 
Me: I don't really care who owns it. Just tell them that they've lost my business.
Waiter: Do you understand why we can't do it? It costs us a lot of money. 
Me: I'm sure you have a lot of expenses. I'm sure it's expensive to rent this building...
Waiter [interrupts]: ACTUALLY we own the building. 
Me: Again, I don't really care... I'm sure you pay for other things. 
Him: It feels like you're personally attacking me!
Me: Ok, whatever. 

Hey, guy: when I ask you to pass on my feedback as a customer to your boss, that's not a personal attack. A personal attack would be if I told you that you were a lousy waiter who is incapable of enforcing a stupid penny-pinching screw the customer policy without affecting an air of righteous indignation at the customer.

I opted for the tofu pudding #5 and the egg pudding since they are still out of taro balls and no timeline as to when it will arrive. Hopefully next month? Anyways, tofu pudding was okay... the texture wasn't silky and it was a bit dense. Not like how they make it in Taiwan and frankly not a fan. #5 comes with the kidney beans and the rice balls, both of which were very good. I also got the egg pudding. It was $2.2 and comes in a small plastic container with sweetened tapioca balls on top. The egg pudding had good egg flavour and the caramel sauce on top balances it out. It's not quite a competitor with Taiwan's Tong YI egg pudding (my fave) but it's still pretty good.

So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.

It looked like the hokkaido ramen seems to be one of their top contenders, so I decided to try that along with a side of gyozas. For their ramen they had 2 sizes and I got the regular size.

The gyozas were pretty good, nicely fried and it was hot, the dipping sauce was nice on the side but I just dipped a little bit otherwise it would be too salty.

The ramen was amazing! For this shop I would definitely says i'ts a hidden gem coz there are certainly a lot of restaurant options in the area, but i was quite surprised to find this place their ramen is certainly more than decent. I love the hoikkado broth - i did drink it and i even packed some home LOL. I was worried it would be too milky for me, but it worked quite well along with the thickness of the pork bone broth and the combo together was just lovely. Ramen was springy and had nice texture to it and I felt the price is quite reasonable for a bowl of ramen this size.

Honey mustard - good
Jerk - very clove-ie, average
Thai - Sweet, not much heat, but not bad
Tandoori - Just a lot of raw tandoori spice rubbed post fry (just overpowering and not easy on the belly)
Apple BBQ- the clear winner so far, a mild bbq sauce, not cinnamonie
Curry - Forgettable, similar problem as with the tandoori
Peanut + Hot - Fantastic, reminiscent of chicken satay
Hot - Good, similar to Frank's Red Hot
Honey garlic - Very sweet, lacking in the garlic flavour

The nachos are huge, easily enough for two to fill their stomachs and reasonably well topped.

If you only have $7.00 in your pocket and want the most bang for the buck in the state, this place is it hands down. 

Some Do's and Dont's if you want to get the most out of your visit.  

Do:  wear clothes that are comfortable and you don't mind getting a little dusty.  
Do: Wear hiking shoes or boots and if you don't have those then a cross training or running shoe would be the minimum.  
Do:  Bring a backpack with some water, granola bars, sunscreen and glasses.   
Do:  Bring a camera for breathtaking snapshots. 
Do:  Enjoy yourself and don't hesitate to jump on a trail and have fun.  

Don't:  wear flip flops, Sandals, or dress shoes.  You won't be able to hike in these safely.  
Don't:  wear nice clothes.  The wind blows and it gets dusty and you can also snag cloths on branches, etc. 
Don't:  come with only 30 minutes to spare.  You can drive through in that amount of time but I would recommend 2 hours of you want to stop and soak in the views and 3 or 4 hours (minimum) if you want to enjoy a nice hike and take in a lifetime experience.

My salad came out as quick as I devoured it!  It was so delicious. It had just the right amount of spiciness where you can still eat it and not kill your taste buds.

I gave him the vin# for the trade in and he then put everything into the computer. After about 10 minutes of plugging everything in he then left to supposedly talk to his manager to ""give us a great deal."" After another 10 minutes he came back with a lowball trade in number which he claimed was from KBB,  and also virtually nothing off the Panamera...he previously said that they wanted to move the car and it would show in the numbers he was going to give me. I then gave him my printed copy of the KBB  dealer trade in value which was $10,000 higher than his trade in number. He must have sized us up and thought we were stupid. We then left.

Also got the little container of overly priced fruit flavored jelly, one lychee + guava flavor and another mango flavor.....$4.95 each....finished it in less than a minute....scraped every last drop, not because it tasted amazing but because it was so expensive that even the scrapings were probably worth $0.50.

The souffle was very light and airy but when you dug deep into the souffle it was mushy and soggy like eating pudding. All this came to about $26 after tax.

In a nutshell -- you've got the right idea, at the right location, with the wrong prices.  

As soon as possible your pizzas need to drop to no more than $12 each.  Why?  They are the lightest and fluffiest pizzas I've had in some time.  Kinda Wonder Bread Pizza, which isn't the worst thing in the world.  It's actually kind of cool -- but not at $20 a pop for a 'snack' pizza which doesn't quite feed one.

Your target customer is someone who doesn't want to spend this kind of money on the strip.  That's kind of what the Linq is all about.  Anti-Casino.  Being outside and freer somehow.  Gouging on airy pizza is a serious mistake.

The pizzas my partner in crime and I had were tasty, mind you.  And the salad we ordered was delicious.  But ripping people off because 'it's the strip' is STUPID.  It will lead to very hesitant recommendations and hesitant repeat business.

A personal pizza that is so light and airy would be about $6 anywhere in the real world, for in order to feel full, you'd either have to order a second or a side dish.  Adjusting for the strip location and such, $10 feels about right.

There are more dishes to select from and everything we ordered were pretty good. We went as a group of 8 people for lunch and we ordered a lot so it was difficult to keep track of everything I tried. I do remember their beef skewers and tenderloin pieces were really good. The black dragon roll had a nice smoky flavor, and the deep-fried squid tentacles were very meaty and cooked just right. The nigiri sushi and ice-cream were pretty standard, no complaints though. 

I read some of the negative reviews on the service and how the servers were not the happiest people in the world. I kind of felt that but they tended to all our requests even when we called them over multiple times to make small orders each time and they didn't make any mistakes with our orders.

The service was great and our waiter was very good about coming back to check on us even though there was a huge party on the other side of the restaurant that he was also assisting. Good service.

The food was okay. We got the Quattro Forno dish which is four different kinds of stuffed shells including manicotti, ravioli, shells and canolli. The food was cooked well and it had good flavor but it was not anything that I would go out of my way to have again. We also got a small order of cheesy garlic bread which could have stood to be cooked a little longer. It tasted good but got cold really fast and no one likes cold bread.

I do not recommend coming here with just two people. The family style dishes are huge even if you just get one small order between two people. They probably gave us 20 large pieces of garlic bread which we definitely could not finish and garlic bread does not reheat well so I felt like I was just wasting it. I would recommend coming here with a party of four or more.

Like Dottsy Z., I haven't been blown away by anything, and I've tried probably a third of the menu.  Everything has been at least ""good"". but considering the prices, I'm on the edge as to how enthusiastically to recommend the place.  Service has always been courteous, which goes a long way with me, but a few times the waits have been oddly long at times that weren't busy.

The French onion soup is a hit for me, although I'd like slightly less brioche.  Served in a mini-tureen, the gruyere is baked perfectly, overflowing the sides in crispy yumminess.  The pate plate is interesting, but much to my disappointment it's not a liver pate.  The frites are almost British style - hot soft and limp, fabulous if you like that style, which I do.  

The outdoor patio is lovely, but can be crammed with tourists toting mewling babies and screaming tots when the weather is nice.",2010-07-10 02:10:41

I'm not familiar with the custom of eating korean bbq (if there is any), we had a waitress who cooked our food. I didn't know they did that. I preferred the bok choy kim chi over the kim chi itself. The cucumber side dish was very good as well, I loved how it was more sweet than spicy. There were also cooked food (fried rice, wontons I think) but I only paid attention to the raw meats.

I'm a fan of the marinade beef and chicken normally, but they keep their dry meats in a cold place. My boyfriend prefers Sura BBQ (says the price is worth it) but I'm fine with both places.

My favorite salads are the Edgar Allan Poe (steak and blue cheese) and the Don Quixote... oh, the Don Quixote.  I usually am not a fan of chicken in salad, but the chicken here is so tasty.  It's juicy, soft, and obviously slow roasted - there's none of that blobby rubbery fat that fast food restaurant salads have.  Pairing that with avocado, that salad is definitely my favorite.

Anyway, I've also been working out and losing weight and I was in desperate need of some good fitting bras that weren't nursing bras, now that that chapter of my life is finished. :) 

Lola helped me first off and did a quick measurement and filled out a card with types of bras I was interested in and sent me to the dressing room where I was assisted by Ashley. She took the card and brought me those kinds of bras to try out and I just had to push a button when I was ready to try on more or different styles. Very cool! I was really excited too because my nursing bras were 40-42 E and now I'm a 34dd! Huge change! So it's amazing to have some new bras that fit wonderfully.

I got a strapless/multiway bra, a daily no underwire bra which is super comfortable and two sexy unlined lace bras and matching panties for all of them. :)

The customer service was amazing and they made it so easy for me as I was really dreading shopping for new bras. I even had my 1 year old with me and he did great while I was trying bras on.

Now the ""salsa"" is DUMB. Lacking in flavor, tomatoes and spice, this is basically a cup of corn with a few diced tomatoes and some parsley on top. At least that's what it tasted like. Seriously, bring me some damn salsa, none of this corny junk. Turns out though, if you want some salsa, cough up $3.95 and expect it to be green. :'( Not cool, IMO!

I got the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos and it was moist and a good portion, but the white sauce everyone is commenting left me asking ""where is it?"". I mean, it was definitely on there but I couldn't taste a thing. Sad day. My sister chose the steak wrap and she didn't say a word from first bite to last and that says it all! :D

It was near noon on a Sunday when we got there, and there weren't many people. 

The menu is vast and made it difficult to decide what to order. Four of our group decided to conquer the Suicide Stack. Another had something off the specials menu...something like ""momma's fried chicken."" The Stack was devoured. 13 layers and it all looked good. I had one of the jalapeno cheese poppers off the top - yum!

I split with a friend the chilaquiles & eggs and the jumbo wet burrito. Both items were made with the awesome green pork chili. It was spicy (an 8 by their rating of hotness), but really really tasty. Some of the chips of the chilaquiles were pretty hard, but smothered in chili, they got soft. Topped with queso fresco...yum! The burrito was filled with chorizo (cooked perfectly), scrambled eggs, cheese, white/blue/sweet potatoes, and topped with the green chili.

L'ambiance est détendue, le cadre très 'frais', reposant. Ce lieu convient aussi bien a une rencontre en famille, qu'entre amis ou même seul.
J'ai vraiment aimé le décor. Le service est amical, rapide et les serveuses ont été capables de m'aiguiller vers des choix ok pour la prise en compte de mes allergies alimentaires. Il y avait une crème de maïs avec des choses dessus et j'ai vraiment aimé. 
C'était au mois de juillet et nous avons facilement trouvé des places pour nous garer dans la rue. Pas sure si c'est toujours le cas mais en tout cas c'était bien pratique!

I ordered the pork bone soup ($6-7), and the bulgogi beef ""sushi"" roll ($5-6). As always, I ordered too much for myself. The pork bone soup alone was enough to have me stuffed.

I've had pork bone soups from other Korean restaurants and none has been as good as this one. Lots of flavor but not salty or overwhelming. Just the right amount of veggies, pork, and potatoes. I felt like the soup wasn't as oily as other places and I didn't feel like there's a film of oil in my mouth or throat.

The bulgogi beef roll was great. Nicely wrapped, beef not overly flavored, rice on point, and the pickled radish done right! I had two pieces and took the rest home because I was already stuffed from the soup.

They bring you complimentary appitizers - kimchi, radish kimchi, pickled cucumbers and a sweet potato. I got two rounds of the potato. They most likely give you a second round as a complimentary and may have to pay for the additional orders like other places.

I want to give credit to the Momma cooks there! I came in and two female chefs were managing the kitchen. It's very rare to see but I love seeing women work the kitchen in this predominantly male industry. I guess that's why they call it ""Mom's kitchen""? :P A male chef came in later on in the night to take over one of the chefs.

Service was great! They weren't overwhelming and constantly coming to check to see if you were okay or asking how the food was - I think we can agree that this gets annoying after a while. They were very attentive, kind and welcoming.

The decor of the restaurant isn't anything special but it's very clean for the most part compared to many other Asian restaurants along Bloor, or even in comparison to many small restaurants in the GTA. It's very brightly lit with some Korean ""idol"" shows on the TV.

I recommend this place! I love that it's 24/7, and chill setting that's welcoming for us lone diners! :)",2015-05-15 03:38:37

This place takes udon and throws a Chipotle-style customize-your-own bowl spin to it. On top of that, the most basic styles are an affordable $5-6. You can then add toppings and side dishes such as onigiri and various tempura to your bowl for $1.75ish. 

I tried the curry beef udon with a large skewer of chicken tempura (three big pieces) and fish cake tempura. The curry was flavorful and had lots of pieces of beef. I was surprised by how well-cooked the udon noodles were. The small bowl of miso garlic pork belly on top of rice was also quite flavorful and crispy. It would've been nicer if the slices of pork belly weren't so thin. Everything came very fast and efficiently - the Japanese way. However, some udon bowls that my friends ordered did take longer to make. The beverage station has a number of different drinks including Calpico, lemonade, and a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. 

The one downside was that many of the pieces of tempura became very soggy. I enjoyed my piece of fish cake tempura as it had just come out of the frier, but everything else including the onion blossom and the chicken had that soggy texture that oozed with leftover oil as you bit into it.

1. Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes. Also, you can ask the waiter to explain the specials. You don't have to speak Chinese or be Chinese to know the specials. After dining here, I realize some people want to sound unique or VIP but trust me, you don't have to be Chinese to taste all the dishes. That is B.S.

2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big.

3. The food is spicy but it isn't hot. If I had to compare it to a Thai restaurant, the food is about a 5 on a 10 scale. You will probably need to ask them to make it spicier even if you are not one of those crazy people that have to eat everything hot. 

4. They do NOT use reheated rice. I was expecting reheated rice that you typically find at Wongs and other Chinese restaurants. This place had fresh soft and sticky rice. It was great.

5. Don't take the American menu for granted. It's done pretty well and includes mainstream meats like chicken, beef, pork. The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu. You will likely use the American menu as your base and then use the Chinese menu to add select items. Bottomline: get both menus

6. The restaurant is not a hole in the wall. It's the opposite. It's the nicest Chinese restaurant I've been to in the valley. Yes it is small but stylish and well lit

7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour. 

8. The service was suprisingly good. Like most great and authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is lousy with the waiters being expressionless and forcing you to order quickly. The servers were Chinese but were very friendly and acted like family. They didn't rush you. Water was refilled quickly

9. Dishes - read what has already been written. This is covered well. I insist on order the the Water Boil dish (includes choice of chicken, beef, fish or shrimp) and ordering it spicy!

10. You don't have to be with a big group, a grad student at ASU or someone who speaks Chinese to enjoy this restaurant. The idea intimidates people because they make it sound as if it's so authentic since it's included in the Chinese Cultural Center but don't be.

I make avocado toast at home a lot, I'm suffering from the flu right now and my sweet husband decided to pick up a smoothie and toast for me for breakfast. I really wish I would have taken a picture. The toast was pitiful. It was a super thin slice of toast with a smear of avocado that was covered in a layer of red pepper flakes. 3 bites and it was gone. I barely tasted the avocado...it was mainly olive oil and pepper  My advice to Clean Juice, offer 2 slices of toast for $3.99...add more avocado! I can buy 2 loaves of sprouted organic bread for $6, $2.50 for an avocado, $0.69 for a lemon, a bottle of red pepper flakes for $2. There is no reason why it should cost that much. You buy a lot of your stuff from Costco! Share the saving with your customers.

The red snapper, pescado burracho, was very fresh.  I'm surprised you can get fresh fish in the Valley and it was well prepared.  This was prepared like my mom used to make it.  5-stars.  This is pan-fried, not deep fried.  The white sauce that came with the fish was okay.  

One thing though when you eat a whole fish, and it's big and I was unable to finish by myself, is that there are small fish bones that you have to sort out and throw away.  In American dishes, this is never done but in Mexico and Vietnam, they cook the whole fish and leave the bones in.  Maybe a little different way to eat if you are not used to it.

The pineapple cilantro margarita was great.  Complimentary chips & salsa were good.

The pinto beans that came with it was an all-star 5 stars.  It made the fish taco so flavorful, like flavor crystals in every bite.  You can't eat the pinto beans by itself.  You have to put in a soft taco.",2018-03-26 02:32:01

Arrived for a moderately late Sunday lunch at 1:30-2pm. Service by ""Fred"", aka Fredrika, was attentive without being intrusive, professional and knowledgeable as to entire menu.  Glasses of tea and water never had chance to get empty, and the food was fantastic.  We ordered off the dinner menu for a couple of items that weren't on the lunch menu - no problem.  Started with the caprese appetizer which as advised by Fredrika, was more enough to provide a generous salad for 3 or 4, a huge plate of fresh mozzarella slices, greens, basic, and slices of tomato so good that I had to ask where the tomatoes came from as they did not taste like a grocery tomato - and they weren't as they were home grown by chef or staff. Not always home grown she said - but currently yes, and they certainly tasted it.  Next, I had the wild mushroom lasagna rolls and my friend the ""Polo's Pasta"".  The 4 lasagna rolls were massive, rich, delicious, and just oozing ricotta, spinach, white & Portobello mushrooms, complimented nicely by the rich  vodka cream sauce and melted mozzarella.  I also sampled my friend's dish which I think is my new favorite, Polo's Pasta: Sautéed spinach, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, Portobello mushrooms, goat cheese in a garlic and olive oil sauce with sweet Italian sausage, that has me very close to moving this to a ""5 Star"" review - and that  before the wonderful dessert which we took home to sample many hours later. The portions were as large as noted in all reviews leaving us with enough for an additional generous meal apiece. And then there was the dessert, courtesy of a Cordon Bleu student serving an externship at the restaurant, an excellent, moist, rich chocolate-chocolate cream, chocolate frosted cake drizzled with what I think was a raspberry sauce, artfully served even in the take-out box.  It too was excellent. My compliments to the student chef. After 2 visits and 2 exceptional food experiences, I can only conclude the over-the-top (or would that be more like ""rock-bottom""?) review who claimed everything was frozen, nothing homemade, etc., etc., etc., had an agenda.

The food just didn't do it for me.  My girlfriend and I decided to split the combo meal which had an assortment of pulled pork, ribs and brisket.  Most memorable was the brisket.  It was flat, very poorly sliced and just not tasty.  The ribs gave the meal a little bit of redemption but overall just not great.

The drinks....woah....love it.  Glycol taps?  Nothing better to make your beer ICE cold!  The selections as far as beer are probably as good as any I've seen in Charlotte.

Originally it was supposed to be held at the location in Westmount but it was changed last minute to the new location outside the Faubourg which was probably a lot better since this restaurant recently opened so was not crowded and it was a shorter walk from a metro than the location at Westmount.

I found service to be okay but a bit chaotic as my order was mixed up by different people bringing different items (ex: asking for something from one server and then someone else putting it on the table; sometimes at the wrong spot; this happened for one of my beers as well as my dessert)

This place has a lot of different types of pizzas and pastas but I opted for their Italian Poutine to give it a try. I also had a 20oz Stella Artois. The Italian Poutine wasn't what I preferred. It has a meat ball on it (which I found interesting) but I wasn't impressed by the sauce nor how they made the fries. I can't really say much about the beer since I'm not a heavy beer drinker but I asked for another Stella Artois after I finished my first. When most people finished their meals, the server gave us the dessert menu. Most people didn't order dessert but I decided to get the cheesecake Amarena. It was very good. A few minutes after the server gave me my dessert, since some people from our party were starting to leave (but the people in my area were still around), she asked if I minded paying now. I mentioned that I didn't have any issues with it and she handed me my bill, I noticed that I wasn't charged for the cheesecake and being the honest person I am, asked about it and she mentioned that they put it on someone else's bill by mistake (he hadn't paid yet and this was one of the items which was brought to the wrong spot after I ordered it). For some reason I was the only person asked to pay in my section of the table who hadn't indicated that he was leaving. I probably wouldn't have had anything else (like a coffee) after the dessert so it wasn't a big deal. She then left and brought me my new bill. Not including tip, my bill came to $35.64. I used my credit card so the place accepts credit cards (not sure about debit cards since no one sitting next to me in our party paid or asked about using a debit card)

Servers were friendly and polite. Since this place recently opened (maybe less than 2 weeks ago from what I understand), the place was not what I considered to be crowded on the night that we went (Friday night). Our party was ~25 people (which were divided into 2 rows at the back of the restaurant) and there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant.

I give this place 3.5 stars which I've rounded up to 4 stars. I would not have any issues coming back for a group/team event but it wouldn't be my first choice. I would probably have one of their pizzas the next time I show up since this is what most people ordered and I wasn't overly impressed by their Italian poutine.",2017-12-16 15:07:58

Not to worry--they brought us both a half serving on individual plates! Our main dishes, a summer vegetable ravioli and a chicken dish, were also brought with side plates and they even brought us a split brownie sundae for dessert.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. The outdoor seating was in high demand, but she did not make us feel rushed in any way. She just would bring us water and ask how we were until we were ready to order. Considering I wanted to spend a leisurely meal catching up with a friend, I definitely appreciated that!

First of all-- how dirty ARE you? And secondly-- showers are for getting clean but a bath is a Human Soup spiked with relaxation, serenity and escape. Throw in a Lush bath bomb and you're pretty close to heaven.

The sales people are really friendly. Normally I hate chatty sales people as I feel pressured and think they're just chatting to make a sale. At Lush, I never feel pressured and once I tell a sales associate that I'm just having a wander, they back off. If anyone else approaches me while I browse it's usually just casual conversation. On the other hand, some Lush products can be confusing... their shampoos are all in disks and there are strange wedges of delicious smelling stuff that all look like cheese or chocolate  (points for the hunger factor). It's nice to be able to approach the sales people and get such delicious information. They all seem very passionate about everything in the store.

The Alkmaar soap is a long time fave of mine with it's gorgeous jasmine scent. I'm not a fan of the bath bombs that have sparkles in them, as they tend to get everywhere, but I love the one with the rose petals. Avobath, a yummy green one with Avocado oil is another fave.I always grab a few of these before I go on vacation because we always try to get a room with a jacuzzi.

You need to know what Whisky River is and what it isn't before you walk through the doors. It's Dale Jr's bar. It's not a five star restaurant. There's a mechanical bull. The girls are hot and dressed to show it. The music may be loud for some people. You'lll hear country music. On Thursdays, you may see some line dancing.

I always have fun when I pop in to The River. A lot of staff members have been here a long time, so I always see a familiar face behind the bar. Tuesday is college night. Don't be shocked if there's a bikini contest. For the sports crowd, there's a bunch of tvs and a projector screen. Sundays NASCAR rules. If Dale Jr wins a race, it's open bar for an hour. If you're looking to do a birthday/bachelor/bachelorette party, they have a nice little VIP area for tables and bottle service. Keep an eye on the events calendar, they always have some sort of fun happenings.

I never come here to eat, but I have had some things here at various events. Ton of wing flavors. There's even a flatbread with mac and cheese on it. They do a lunch menu where everything is $8.88 (includes fries and non-alcoholic drink).

The good:
- It's close to my house
- The servers speak perfect English
- It was pretty fast
- It was packed (which like Neil, should have been a warning sign)

The bad:
- The beef in my pho was sketchy looking and fattier than rare beef at the other pho places
- The broth wasn't as translucent as other places, it was cloudy
- I expected the cloud was beef bits that would impart a more robust flavour but... I was let down
- My can of pop was over $1, which I never think is right at dumpy places.  Pop should be $1, the end.

The salad had cucumbers, lettuce and tomato with a French type dressing that was very tasty.  For my entrée I went with the petite filet with a white pepper sauce that I asked for on the side.

- Running out of fajita veggies. 
This seems to happen every goddamn time we go in this place. This sucks as my girlfriend is a vegetarian. And I don't like beans. Know that song ""beans, beans, the magical fruit?"" Yea, that was written about what happens in my posterior when I eat Chipotle's beans. 

- Short changing us in our burrito...
Really, a half scoop of rice, 1/3 the normal amount of fajita veggies, and 1/2 the amount of meat? It's not my job to teach you your job. For Christ's sake Chipoltlenauts, do unto my burrito as you would do unto your own. Isn't that the golden rule of Burrito Jesus?

- Passing off shoddy product
When the tortilla comes out of the warmer half ripped, start over again. Its not your money that's being spent on the wrapper there warmer technician, so in keeping with the grand Communist edict of ""Workers of the World Unite!"" stop screwing me by passing the losses on to your customer. If anything we should be standing against the corporate oppressors who are your bosses and the Mister Charlie standing between me and a good burrito.

Chipoodle's website says:
""At Chipotle, we aim to do a few things but do them exceptionally well. When Chipotle first opened its doors in 1993, the goal was simple: to serve high quality, delicious food quickly with an experience that not only exceeded, but redefined the fast food experience.

To that end, we focus on sourcing the best possible ingredients, serving the tastiest food, and growing the most capable team we can.

I love wings, especially coming here so often I love their lemon pepper wings. Their wings are just a hit and miss sometimes. Sometimes, they take FOREVER and sometimes the service is really quick. Everyone here is pretty much straight forward... Not nice and not mean. They are there to just take your order and cook it for you. Tables don't really get clean and the size of the restaurant is pretty small.
As for the food, it just wings. Nothing special.. They do have good wings. Its just basic sauce for wings, mild, medium, hot, buffalo, bbq. Although, their dry wings are the best I've encountered. My favs are Louisiana Rub and Lemon Pepper.",2016-01-31 21:09:05
AUUzYS85i97Xkc5GKRe8Tw,MWww0eiHa1YY-MdU1faNKA,TuWw6Om50yA5jSXm7dma3g,4,0,0,0,"This pizza is definitely unusual. First off, it's square! Not a rectangle either. Square! It has a satisfyingly crunchy bottom crust, that justified the name crisp pizza. The dough is light and airy. It is closest to a sicilian crust, but not as thick. The sauce has a more fresh ""raw"" flavor than a traditional NY style pie. They finish every pie with fresh basil leaves and a squirt of extra virgin olive oil. A very cool touch.

I tried to order a small pie with half meatball, half mushroom. They said they could only do half and half on large pies. That confused me. I was taught that in the restaurant business, there is always a path to saying yes. And doing a half and half pie is such a normal thing in a pizzeria, I was momentarily stumped.

When I said that for the right price anything in a restaurant should be doable, they replied that the register wasn't set up for it. In the end they find a way to ring it up. $18 and change. To the owner: add a half and half small pizza option to your register please. It's definitely doable! Even if there is a small upcharge for the extra labor. 

The mushrooms weren't special at all. I've had some fantastic mushrooms at other joints. The sauce dominated any flavor they might have had, but eating one solo didn't impress.

But the Meatballs! Oh yes! I struggle to find a good new york style meatball anywhere in Arizona. But these nailed it! NY style pizza meatballs are not crumbled beef. They aren't balls or half balls of meat. They aren't small. They are supposed to be flat disks, like large pepperoni. And you should see herbs or garlic in every delicious slice. Crisp's meatballs hit the mark! In the photo, you can clearly see the delicious garlic sparkling in every one.

I liked the music and the cool garage-door store-front. The tables are communal style. They are only open till ten on the weekends, so there won't be any after bar socializing at those tables.",2018-05-20 00:19:10

The ambiance: more New England than Asian, it feels cool and unique.

The service: friendly, casual, and helpful.

The drinks: great cocktail menu. I tried the bobbie-jo (I think), and it was my usual - gin, cucumber, refreshing. I also had the celina (or something like that??) and it was very cinnamon-y spice-y with a house-infused whiskey and candied ginger. Really liked them both. There is also a short beer list (10ish) and about 15 wines.

The food: awesome! We had some raw oysters (blue points and beau soleils), oysters Rockefeller with foie gras, kim chee fried rice, tuna tartare, Japanese uni, and the chef's choice sashimi. All were good. I always love raw oysters, and especially liked the oysters Rockefeller. The tuna tartare was a really big portion, served with spicy waffle fries, and the fried rice was pretty big too - came with pork belly and a fried egg. I'm not an uni eater, but my husband really loves it, and he said this was some of the best he's had.

The damage: 3 drinks and a bunch of food was $110 total. Pretty reasonable for the quality you're receiving. Blue points were only $1 and beau soleils $2. 

The problem: it's not closer to my house!",2015-04-17 15:20:42

I was a bit taken back by the american rock-pop music that was playing and felt that some authentic Thai music would have suited the place better. The dish I ordered (spicy teriyaki crunchy chicken) was not spicy at all and the chicken was hard to find around huge thickly breaded and deep fried chunks of batter. I really don't recall ever tasting the actual chicken. If this dish had real pieces of chicken and some real spice it would have been good. The teriyaki sauce was a nice flavor.

We had a great experience with aC (6 years old) and would surely come back again if we're in the area.

SIDES: 
The bacon cheddar biscuits are some of the best biscuits I've ever had.  You must try these.  They aren't light, flaky, and airy like traditional southern biscuits, but are crunchy on the outside with tons of cheese, bacon, and even some scallions.  The apple butter adds a sweetness and plays well with the rich, flavors of the biscuits.

MAINS: 
The fork tender short ribs were just as advertised.  No knife needed and full of rich flavors.  These were top notch, paired well with the mashed potatoes and veggies, and highly recommended.  There are a lot of other dishes that looked great, but I'd have to order this again next time.

I had a bit of AC's B Burger, which was top notch - juicy with a light brioche bun that was just enough to stand up to the juices and grease, and to hold up the large burger and thick bacon.  The fries were good as well, but not super memorable.

DESSERT: 
We had the cinnamon sugar donut holes which were very good.  You get four large, crunchy cake donuts served over dollops of banana pudding of banana pudding and drizzled with chocolate and caramel.  The cinnamon sure gives it a churro-like flavor but it has a lot more heft.

DRINKS: 
With 1/2 price Arizona wine on Sundays, we ordered a bottle of Dos Cabezas red (a light GMS blend) for $20.50, which is roughly what you would pay at retail.  You can essentially get a bottle of local wine without the markup.

KIDS MENU:
The kids menu is chock full of well prepared food that kids love like sliders, PB&J, and quesadillas.  aC kept it simple by ordering pasta with butter, which was cooked  al dente and not swimming in butter, along with fruit as her side.  She also got a fresh chocolate cookie included with her meal.",2014-03-16 22:04:10

The company started on the West coast and has been slow (other the a holiday's kiosk) to make their way to the Burgh.  I was elated to see this new store in the Ross Park Mall.  I will no longer have to pick these treats up when I travel.  

See's Candies has a long history.  It was founded by Charles See and his wife Florence and his mother Mary in Los Angeles, California back in 1921.  Mother Mary developed the recipes that are the foundation of the business.  The clean, black and white shop was designed to resemble Mary See's own kitchen.  In 1972, the See's family sold the company to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  But they strive to maintain the old fashioned values of the See family.  These are some of the most delicious chocolates you will ever taste. 

This store is typical of See's.  My favorite part of each visit is a free sample at the counter.  It's fun to pick the individual chocolates from the case.  But I am more likely to do directly to the already boxed candies and select the nuts and chews.  It's my favorite.  Another thing I like about See's is the holiday chocolates.

The milk tea was good, not great, slightly cheaper than the tea place nearby. The banh mi's are long and skinny, so they were a good size.

Bathrooms here are clean and they made good use of the space in the restaurant to make sure there is ample seating.

We sat outside in the little patio area, which is nice to watch the foot traffic go by. Started off with the latkes, which were crispy perfection, served with sour cream.

My main dish was similar to a falafel or gyro. It was wrapped in pita bread with fried eggplant and tomato and it was awesome! Again, crispy eggplant is the best, don't give me mush! The side of coleslaw was done just right. Not too much mayo, but sweetened appropriately. I'm a hard judge towards coleslaw and it passed!

The presentation was adorable too! It came on a tray with the coleslaw in a Chinese take-out carton. Service was very friendly and our bill for two people was $30. Not bad in my opinion.

I will note that the menu only offered about four main dishes and the rest are sandwiches. But a limited menu isn't always a bad thing, as I found out!",2014-08-14 02:39:27

It went from being a little red building that I would pass on the side of the road from time to time over to Wong's, the almighty Chinese food joint. I knew it was a restaurant but I probably wouldn't have stopped unless it were for my co-workers who were going one day and asked if I wanted to go. I am so thankful I said ""Yes!"".

It is a dive. You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the head and you could probably convert the entire place to a motorcycle shop in less than an hour. Extra beverages are stacked against the wall, the tables are small, and the air conditioning is probably in need of a service call. All part of the ambiance! The menu isn't a surprise. When I visit a new Chinese place my first meal is always sweet and sour pork. This way I can get a bead on the same meals and see how they handle the basics. Like most other Chinese restaurant lunch entrees, Wong's lunch comes with an egg roll and rice. In this case it was sticky white rice. Crunchy, drippy sumptuous sweet and suckling sour chicken. It ranks up there with some of the best for certain. The rice was a wonderful mix of sticky and fluffy. I like to eat with chopsticks when possible and this rice was definitely edible with the primitive yet effective utensils. Back and for between the awesome chicken and rice to finally the egg roll. Crispy almost flaky wrapper with an almost too finely minced filling of pork, cabbage, and carrots. The three simply complimented one another throughout the entire lunch. So, so good.  

Wong's is EXACTLY why you don't go to a chain and why you don't continue to drive past that place you have seen a million times but never was curious enough to actually stop and dine. The prices are super reasonable to boot. Have I been burned by places like this? Yes, but the few duds are heavily outweighed by other good places and certainly by great places like this. Stop the next time you are driving by if this place looks sketchy, scary, or outright out of place. Because it is but inside they are serving delicious food.",2012-09-14 03:07:02

Here are a few insider tips:

1. Cocktails are inexpensive and are generally above average to good in terms of quality.
2. On Monday night they do complimentary charcuterie platters all around the bar. This is great on one hand, yet not super hygienic-looking once you sit down in front of a board that has been picked over already by the people who say their before you. Also, lots of friends of the staff and people with the munchies on Monday night, so more of a crowd.
3. They have more of a European beer focus, which fills a nice niche in the neighbourhood.
4. In addition to beer they advertise wines by the glass from common, well-known wineries.
5. They provide complimentary peanuts with the beer, which are great.
6. The bar is a reimagined, more grown-up version of Marget that was in the space before. It is still odd and funky without trying too hard to fit an easy categorization such as ""hipster"" or ""trendy"".",2016-03-31 23:17:52

Many do not know this but once upon a time, I used to really love sweets. Big on cheesecakes, pies, cakes, small pastries... although never about cookies. They are soulless, buttered treats that are meant to kill you. :-P

Anyway, I stopped eating sweets a few years ago, in fact I just recently had a chocolate bar after... Wow, almost 5 years. Damn you Halloween induced peer pressure! 

I digress, this little spot in Korean town is fairly unique as nowhere else in town can you get these tasty little pastries filled delicious walnut, red bean or potato filling.  

Personally I have tried them all and the red bean, is not my favourite as I rather prefer the other flavours, the walnut is my favourite and the potato is alright. When I go I mostly get the walnut filled ones. 

They also sell Korean flat pancakes which is not anything like its savory Japanese cousin but if you do get it, eat them warm. Just like pastries, they really do shine when fresh and loose a little bit of their luster as they cool. I have noticed they make the snacks throughout the day and late afternoon, the pancakes seems like they make them constantly.   

They do not have a lot of space so if you want to snack in, well, just be aware they are short on space, and tables and chairs. Personally I pick to go.

The owner is very friendly and during my first time there, I mentioned that I would be back and asked at what time they close, at which point she gave me her card and said: ""We close at 10:00pm but if you are coming, just call in and I will keep the store open."" I am sure she meant within reason but that is insanely good customer service to have even offered. The type I have seen in other parts of the world but hardly ever here. You can feel that she enjoys what she does. 

On that alone she has a new customer in me, not to mention they are great snacks.

The place was clean and like I said way packed, but it was pretty organized and well stocked. The manager was manning the register and doing his best to get the food up and paid and customers off as quickly as possible.

It's almost a crap shoot now a days because you can either find something decent or you can fall really, really short.  

Yang's is chinese owned and run, I guess that's pretty important sometimes to show how legit a restaurant is.  The place is usually jammed most of the time which I guess shows how good the place is.  

A thing I really like about Yangs is that they have a decent sushi and sashimi selection.  The fish is usually pretty fresh and you get a generous portion of it (unlike the razor thin portions some places do).  Their special rolls are so-so, and their sushi is alright as well.  One thing I appreciate that they have is the salmon roe sushi (which I like a lot).  I personally think their sushi rice needs a bit of work though.  I know it's an all-you-can-eat quality, but I really dislike the hard rice which I've gotten some times.

The rest of the menu Items are pretty decent as well.  The dishes themselves are pretty generic, but what sets Yang's apart is their grilled fish and ramen.  If you actually are into it, you can get a grilled salmon head (or any other part for that matter), as well as grilled mackerel.  These are pretty good to get your slow snacking on (cause they love it when you stay long =/).  I found it's pretty hard to find a all-you-can-eat place that will actually serves stuff like this.

Now ramen... I've had hit and miss with the ramen here.  I've had ones that were alright and ones that were pretty craptastic.  Either way, I like having something warming go down so I usually order it anyways.  It's not the best ramen, but at least I can keep ordering it.

Yang's isn't the best all-you-can-eat japanese restaurant I've been to, but it is one of the best ones around the area (geez, are we really stuck with this?).  Would I come back?  Probably if I have a hankering for some sushi.",2011-04-27 12:51:01

Or peeing out by the dumpster because it's quicker than finding a bathroom.

It's a guilty ""pleasure""...OK, I'm not sure ""Pleasure"" and Church's really go together (unless you really like rolling around in chicken fat, like I do...oop's! over-sharing again!)...more of a guilty ""thing""

At any rate, I know I shouldn't, but there are times when only a bucket (or in Church's case, a box) of greasy fried chicken will do.

And when that happens, well...it's Church's instead of the 11 herbs and spices that theoretically go into KFC (or Kitchen Fresh Chicken...or Kentucky Fried Chicken, or whatever the hell they call themselves these days).

A bunch of people showed up for dinner tonight and Church's is the go-to for that kind of thing (at least it is when they all suggest I cook and I say ""thanks, no"" and they give me the ""eeew"" face when I suggest pizza).

As the consummate host, I reminded my guests that Church's:

 -  Has never given me the trot's, unlike KFC...important since it's my house and me lighting a match is ""optional"";

 - Is less expensive than KFC, since I'm buying the feast;

 - Goes well with pretty much any wine (OK, I made this last one up but, I figure they won't notice once they have drunk enough of my wine)

TYBj0QXea6Ch1-NPvc8vzw,PrwnAL82LL4Ewt_wJpHWCA,PJ8VJqsTdJno0beARzaTrQ,4,10,4,5,"Mmmmm hot pot. I love hot pot and have been waiting for CLE to get a hotpot restaurant for some time (and am too lazy to buy the hot pot and all the ingredients myself, so having a restaurant is quite nice).

It's a large restaurant- one side is for the sushi/hibatchi and the other side is solely dedicated to hot pot. The tables have the electric burner in the middle as well as accommodating individual hot pots with individualized controls, etcera.

The waitress was Chinese and proceeded on speaking Mandarin to me the moment we sat down. haha. Luckily I can understand enough, but am pretty horrible on responding, so I just answered back in English- and the waitress switched to English for me. haha.

We did not follow the other yelp reviews and went for dinner instead. It's just hard to make it out to this area during lunch time (and seriously, who has TIME to leave work for lunch???!). Anyways, the dinner price is $24.95 (or $32.95 if you get the premium seafood stuffs) for all you can eat hot pot. So, come hungry. You'll have a time limit of 2 hours and if you waste food, they'll charge you by the pound (I mean, it makes sense, right? Just don't be wasteful!).

There are various soup bases to pick from- I always like having a mixed soup hot pot, so we got the sha cha flavor as well as the Sichuan spicy (which...was pretty spicy!). 

You then proceed to look at the menu and write down on a piece of paper (kind of like dim sum style), what you want. There's a large assortment of meats (ranging from fatty lamb/beef, liver, stomach, chicken gizzard, etc), large assortment of seafood (crab, clam, mussels, fish fillets, etc), typical balls you cook in hot pot (various fish balls like cuttlefish or homemade fish balls, beef balls, etc), and other items like many different veggies, lotus root, fish tofu, wood ear, etc etc, the list is quite huge. To me, you don't even need to get the ""premium"" hot pot special, because just the general is fine.

Off to the side, there's also a station where you can get various sauces and toppings to go with your food.

We got:
- Fatty lamb
- Fatty beef
- Fuchow fish ball
- Cuttlefish fish ball
- Homemade fish ball
- Fish Tofu
- Wood Ear
- Watercress

All were very good- I was impressed with the cuts of the fatty lamb and beef and our favorite was definitely the homemade fish ball and the fish tofu. We got second plates of those.

Overall, I thought the hot pot was very good. I thought the soups could be a tad more flavorful (maybe I've been spoiled from hot pot restaurants in different cities), but for the quality and amount of food you get (I mean, it's all you can eat- it's practically a buffet), I thought it was good. I think it's probably a BETTER price and choice to come during lunch, but if you're busy working ppls like us, we don't have time for that! 

If it's cold and you're craving some good warm healthy food, check out this hot pot place- and probably come for lunch to get the most bang for your buck (but I do think it's worth the dinner price- just come with a big appetite!).",2016-12-05 02:03:45

O5HXCSdjms6hSi4MEWOlPw,tE0aznXzQo-JRbHHHoFmfw,h_4dPV9M9aYaBliH1Eoeeg,3,0,0,0,"Inspired by Munich style beer halls, Wvrst opened mid last year in the Toronto King West area, serving up some exotic sausages and a wide variety of beers. I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and luckily I was able to find someone who was yet to have tried it.  Thanks for coming with me Justine H! In a nutshell, this place is like Oktoberfest, and now you can have it everyday at Wvrst!

Wvrst  definitely has flavours of a European sausage and beer hall, and really reminded me of Oktoberfest (except nicer). It's spacious and dimly lit with with ceiling strung lights --a casually comfortable place.

Wvrst Menu
Scattered around the hall tables were these long sheets of recycled paper which would be the menu. If you're looking for something other than fries, sausages, and alcohol, you're probably at the wrong place. The menu is simple, but the numerous options lie in the type of each you fancy.

At the back of the establishment there is a long open space that leads up to a rather small counter where you order and pay. I imagine this empty space is filled up by a line up during busier lunch hours. It wasn't too bad on the Tuesday night that we went.


Sausage Display Case
The display case is neatly organized with all the different sausages that they have. If you're in the mood for some exotic meats, then you're in luck. They have everything from kangaroo to venison, rabbit to guinea fowl. Justine H and I weren't too appetized looking at it, but after we managed to get over its appearance we went up to the counter to order.


Drinks
They have quite a number of beers here, bottled and on tap. Definitely not as many as a place like Beer Bistro might have, but more than just your commonly seen brews. Justine opted for the San Pellegrino Orange, and me an Austrailian beer Stiegl. Figured it was only fitting that I had a beer in the given setting!


Bratwvrst ($6) -Veal, Pork, and Wine
Duck ($9) -Maple and Fois Gras

These contemporary European sausages for the most part were quite good. Juicy and full of flavour. Didn't feel like I was eating a super artificial chunk of meat like I do having hot dogs from street vendors. In terms of flavour, I think it really depends on the sausage you order. You could definitely taste the fois gras in the Duck sausage, which was something Justine H didn't enjoy too much. I didn't mind it and found it to be an interesting combination, but I definitely liked the Bratwvrst more. I'd like to add that these sausages are quite small, and even with my small appetite I was unsatisfied having just the one hot dog.


Duck Fat Fries ($4.50)
Lots of other food enthusiasts raved about these fries, so we ordered a serving to share. Perhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the amazing reviews, but these duck fat fries fell just a bit short. They were full bodied, thick, and buttery, but they just weren't amazing. To be honest, I couldn't differentiate what difference the duck fat had on the fries compared to the ones made in regular oil. The order of fries comes with one dipping sauce, and the Wvrst Spicy we chose was great. Definitely not the best fries I've had, but they are quite tasty still, and would easily satisfy those random starchy fry cravings.


One last thing to note, is that they are big on leafs games here! They have a ticket giveaway at around 6:30pm the night of every Leaf's game at the Air Canada Center. With TV's all around the dining hall and tables that encourage conversation, it would be a great place to go catch the game along with a couple of drinks. But be warned, it might get pretty rowdy later in the night with cheering Leafs fans who've had a couple drinks or two!",2012-02-03 23:39:38

The people working there were friendly, but not ingratiatingly so. The menu and prices - on par with other coffee shops. I had to try something to eat, but none of the baked goods had mad shelf appeal. I went for the cardamom coffee cake, which looked about as exciting as burnt white toast. Appearances are deceiving! A sweet, milky vanilla-caramel cake with a thick ribbon of dense, concentrated cinnamon based spice running throughout, all with a thin and barely perceptible glaze on top. Yum yum yum! A little greasy and so definitely not on my every day meal plan, but this will serve nicely for a treat every now and again. 

The coffee is average, but I'm no coffee snob. (I am baffled by those who suggest the barista should ""learn to pull a good shot"". WTF?) It's not Starbucks-burnt, so it works for me.

Oh yeah, and they were actually open when I got there a little after 6:30. What's up with coffee shops that don't open until 7 (or later!!!)?

They have a great location in Desert Shores right on the water. I enjoy stopping by for a good glass of wine and their cheese plate while sitting outside near the water in early June.

On this past Saturday evening, we did sit outside and the heat lamps were on so it was very comfortable. There was a guitar playing some good music which added to the ambiance. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne which was something new but we all really liked it and toasted happily. We were quickly greeted by our waiter who told us about the specials and then gave us ample time to make our decisions. I appreciate when a restaurant allows you to take your time and doesn't rush you to order. This allows one to enjoy the evening. We decided on the Swordfish, New York Steak with a large prawn, and the Pork Loin.  We also enjoyed the goat cheese/compote on a flaky croissant for appetizer.

I went in and picked the wine. We enjoyed a nice Tobin James Zinfandel. If you are a wine lover like me, this part is fun since you have a whole store of 900+ bottles to choose which kind of wine you want to drink!

The Swordfish was so buttery and tender. It simply melted in your mouth. The Pork Loin was also very tasty my friend told me as she has had it before and it is one of their best dishes. Out of all three dishes, the NY steak and prawn were just disappointing. Although the steak was tender and served in a Bernaise sauce it was just lacking and I probably made a mistake in ordering it. I will not discount the restaurant for this one dish as I have had several amazing dishes dining here so it would not be fair to grade them poorly for my mistake.

We ended our meal with some tasty desserts. The service was excellent and the temperature was comfortable on the patio. If you find yourself in the neighborhood be sure to stop in for brunch, lunch or
dinner. This place is a main stay in this part of town!",2016-03-08 05:24:21

The marrow was rich and savoury with nice zest/herb aromatics, perfect atop of the toasted slices of bread they came with; I only wish it came with more. For the amatriciana: the spaghetti noodles had a substantial and pleasant bite to it, and the sauce was a lovely balance of the tartness of the tomato against the guanciale---personally I would've liked a little more heat from the chili but it was very enjoyable nonetheless.

Atmosphere - Open layout and open kitchen, but the noise level is not too loud. Very comfortable.

Service - It wasn't too busy when we started so we received attention but I felt rushed. I realize that the kitchen wasn't busy but the app dishes were barely up when the main plates were down. 

Food - One main dish was a fail but otherwise the food was excellent. Deviled Egg of the Day - Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I can't even remember how it was prepped other than the smoked cashews but what a innovative way to start the meal. In the future I'll try whatever the DED is. Shrimp, Sausage & Grits appetizer - Another great dish to start. The serving size is perfect to get the great flavors in the dish. The shrimp was buttery and not over cooked. The sausage was sliced thin and had great flavor but not spicy. The grits were the creamiest I've had and the jus that was added was rich. Port Osso Bucco - A dish I'd go back for. The pork was moist and flavorful. The spaetzle was great and had a crunch to it, assuming from the carrot. Fork Tender Short Ribs - This was the fail, and for a signature dish it was even more disappointing. The ribs were either too lean or overcooked & held too long, but the sauce they put over the top wasn't enough to keep them from being dry. The mashed potatoes were bland. Dessert - The Chocolate Dipped Bacon Smores was a deconstructed smore with each item having great flavor but difficult to eat. I wouldn't go back to this one.

We ended up splitting a kale (& raisin) salad, and a baked carbonara pasta dish. Both were very very delicious (although the kale salad was a bit overly acidic and too sweet at the same time).

The two-day general admission ticket ran about $160/pp this year which, while expensive, is very worth it.  Between the awesome food, the seemingly never-ending pours of wine and beer, and the always changing amenities this is the best food festival in Phoenix. 

The crowds this year made it a lot tighter than years past.  I'm not sure if that's from more media credentials, more tickets sold, or the fact that every line seemed to be 40% volunteers/employees who were on break.  As a paying guest, this is pretty annoying.  An additional area of improvement can be with organizing those lines.  Between people blending lines together and not moving once they get their food, it gets confusing if two popular spots are next to each other.  

The restaurants all do a great job in presenting their dishes and it's great to get to try lots of new places.  Phoenix represents itself well here and if you like eating and drinking in a beautiful setting...this is a splurge worth doing.",2016-03-07 16:48:37

I like staying at the non-gaming, non-smoking hotels because I feel more relaxed after the trip and I don't go home reeking of smoke or coughing. That said, that was one of the reason's I enjoyed the Trump hotel. 

The lobby is beautiful, the rooms were nice & spacious and it was right across the street from Fashion Show Mall. We could walk to the Wynn and Treasure Island, no problem and the hotel offered a shuttle to Ceasar's. 

Now, time for the not so nice: 
They have a small restaurant and bar in the lobby, but  lacking a small coffee shop. A girl needs her latte in the mornings! I stayed at the Vdara which is similar in concept and they had a little snack/coffee shop in the lobby which was the perfect place to grab a coffee or quick bite. 

We had an odd relationship with housekeeping & room service. We called down for cups numerous times. We NEVER got them, however someone brought up two robes up to us TWICE and we never asked for them. I don't know how you confuse cups with robes??? 

Secondly, we asked housekeeping to clean our room before we left for the night. They came and made up the bed, left the sofa bed unmade and the bathroom uncleaned. We were very confused. Then, they left us a voicemail saying they were sorry they couldn't clean our room. My friends and I were slightly confused....... I am still confused.

The service was truly awful. I will not lie, they did try their best to be accommodating, but failed miserably. I waited over half an hour for my salmon soba, where there were four employees in total who could not get to it. The whole waiting time consisted of each employee mentioning the words salmon soba on average of 4x PER PERSON. It was interesting to see how other people who came in after myself, retrieved their orders quickly. I also ordered the scallion pancake which came out in a timely manner. I enjoyed eating this while waiting for my entree to come out. After my salmon soba arrived, one of the cooks asked if I wanted sauce for my scallion pancake which I was already finishing up. He apologized, but at that point and time there was nothing that could be done. I have no idea as to why it took so long for my bubble tea to be made, another employee waited until the last minute to make me one which only took her two minutes to make. I had the strawberry bubble tea, which I did not enjoy (but I am particular about my bubble tea). 
Other notes: seating is rough as they're are two long tables available with one small circle table by the restroom, so for those not comfortable with sitting next to a stranger, maybe this place is not for you.

Seems like every time I go in the store, this one in particular, they are in a perpetual state of entropic disorganization. You can never really find the alternative sizes for a shirt you like because they're all in mixed piles on tabletops. It's also as if they are constantly remodeling. In particular you can always be sure to find that the men's section has shrunk a little more each time you visit. I have never once come in here to find it perfectly organized.

That said, I can still award Old Navy 3 stars. While the clothes aren't top quality, they still manage to have a decent variety of menswear squeezed into what little bit of area remains. Lately I noticed they've got a lot of shirts that emphasize ""going outside"" and nature and such. It seems to be the trend these days, at least for me. Though that won't change my dislike for ""shirts with words on them"". And if you're in that boat with me, you will be delighted to find that ON has a great selection of both patterned and plain shirts to be had. This includes my personal favorite: heather. You know that sort of washed out/textured look that is added to make a single color shirt look more complex. I love that design and Old Navy has it on lock. Another personal favorite of mine here is the selection of work-out-wear for men. Lots of color, lots of visibility and reflectivity and actually a dash of style that is on the level of H&M for men's work out gear.

Be aware that their clothes all seem to run large and short and they absolutely do shrink in the dryer.

This is a British tea shop run by hospitable Chinese folk. The place is covered in British decor right down to the wallpaper. There is a strong attention to detail and they seek to ensure you have a pleasurable experience at their tea shop.

This shop is the inside of a small barely frequented mall. There is seating indoors and also outside in the mall area.

My mom and I came here without a reservation. We waited at the reception for about over 10 minutes.  No one came out from the kitchen. Eventually we knocked at the door and they were extremely apologetic so we appreciated that. If this happens to you, just knock at their kitchen door.

There is limited seating so you are better off making a reservation. Also that gives them time to prepare the food for your arrival. The scones are fresh and the desserts are cute. The sandwhiches are typical finger sandwhiches such as cucumber sandwich, smoked salmon n cream cheese, and egg sandwhich. We don't eat meat so they gave us extra smoked salmon sandwhiches.


The staff was very attentive and even offered to take pics for us.  The presentation of the meal is beautifully done and the tea selection is plentiful.

ALERT!!! The afternoon and high tea prices are per person, so you're looking at $60 total for two people with tax.  You can order other things instead like crepes or eggs etc.

 I recommend this shop.",2015-06-22 17:02:16

It is a small, cute little place in cabbage town. The place has a nice vibe, a bit on the noisy side but not extremely loud like guu. The decor with the flashing lights was a little disturbing and very uncomfortable for the eyes. 

It is a reality expensive place for the food that they serve. The food is not terrible but I don't think some of the items were worth the price. 

As well, when I went they revised their menu and removed a few things like the bone marrow and sea urchin shooter from the menu which was what I was looking forward to, so that was rather disappointing. 

The food: 
The ramen was bland, oily and not very appetizing at all. 

The fried chicken was nice and crispy, tasted a lot better then I expected. It comes with salt and pepper but it's not necessary. It's good on its own as well.

The tuna, prawn and avocado tartar was very disappointing. You can barely taste the seafood and the avocado lacked flavour. The whole dish was rather bland and disappointing. 

The duck cooked on the hot stone was one of their specials. It was a cool and neat thing to order, def something different. 

The tuna salad was very tasty and flavourful. I would say the best dish I had there. I def recommend this!

The bad...
- The menus were falling apart...not a tough thing to fix if someone in leadership is paying attention.
- Chips were greasy...way more than they should have been
- We asked for sliced avocado...they were out.  How does a Mexican restaurant run out of avocado?
- Fish tacos were absolutely unremarkable
- The ""slaw"" on the fish tacos was several orders of magnitude less remarkable than the fish tacos themselves
- I'm still trying to identify the tortilla the fish tacos were served in.

My first experience with self-wash, at a nearby competitor, was horrible, but my time at Wag&Wash was so much better.

The facility here is clean and fairly spacious.  The stainless steel tubs are sturdy, and the spray equipment and drains all worked well.  They had a rubber brush to use on the dog's fur while sudsing and washcloths available for cleaning ears, etc.

I did have a little trouble with the suction-cup-leash that was supposed to hold my 70 lb dog secured to the front side of the tub.  
It didn't.  
A wet dog jumping over the edge of a slippery wet stainless steel tub that's elevated several feet over a slippery wet tile floor is not a healthy combination for the poor dog, who pulled a ""Bambi on ice"" and comically (but i'm sure painfully) spread all four limbs out in all directions and landed face first on the floor.  I asked for a non-suction-cup leash and secured him to a bar at front of the tub afterwards, but damage done.

Just go with the basic wash; the pricing options for various extras aren't worth it.  Why pay an extra several dollars for a specific scent of shampoo, when there isn't a conditioner with the same scent, since the conditioner is what the dog ends up smelling like afterwards, not the shampoo?

The blow dryers were powerful enough to blow out not only the water, but lots of leftover hair.  Sometimes the nozzle end blew off the hose, but i'd rather have the blowers be too hard than too soft.

I feed rawmeatybones, so i didn't shop the food selection much, but the premium brands offered are expectedly pricey.  I did pick up a rubber brush for cheap de-furring.

I will be back to use my frequent washer card.

If you're familiar with the Amy's line of frozen entrees, we love the cheese enchiladas, but at $3.79 for one box, they can get pretty pricey. TJS has a very comparable one for $1.99, and since it doesn't have the cardboard box, it's less waste too!

Another frozen item we love are the chicken lemongrass sticks. Similar to mini egg rolls or lumpias, these really have a ton of lemongrass flavor. They don't come with sauce but are great with banana ketchup, which you should already have in your pantry anyway!

Lastly, TJS has a lot of dark chocolate bar options mostly for $1.99 or less. My faves so far are the toffee, walnut and almond with sea salt, and the bacon and ganache, both of which are located next to the check out aisles.

The fact that I can't remember the details doesn't speak so highly, but I do recall that it was good, if not exceptional.  Very solid comfort-food offerings, that mostly seemed to be at the appropriate price point for what's given.  

I do remember that the first biscuits sent out were room temperature and seemed stale, but the waitress saw I had only picked at mine, and brought more out - this time from a fresh, hot batch.  Much better. 

I had Meat & 3: pot roast, butternut squash, collards and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were listed with gravy on the menu, but only came out with a dish of broth/au jus on the side. I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be the ""gravy"", or if that was for the pot roast and they just forgot the potato gravy all together? Anyway, it was decent and filling, and would have had leftovers if I'd cared to take them home.  Nothing too special though.  Pot roast was fork-tender though, I'll give it that.

Fiance ordered...some kind of fried fish, with tomato jam on a bed of cheesy grits.  His dish was definitely of a higher caliber than mine, more upscale, both in presentation and in flavor experience, but you could have told that in advance based on the menu descriptions and prices of our respective dishes.

This was our first visit, spurred on by an about-to-expire online coupon we'd purchased.  Overall the experience was fine, but we had a long wait before being seated, and the jazz duo/trio (?), which we were seated near, was a bit too loud to be able to converse and hear each other.

King's Kitchen was fine for one evening's eating adventure, but there are other restaurants in Charlotte that we have had consistently better experiences at, so this one is unlikely to enter our repertoire for future revisits.",2011-10-28 23:13:51

After selecting wine, we started out by splitting the house salad - divided between two people it was just enough and a good start to the meal. I had that evening's special - halibut served with mushrooms and asparagus. The fish was prepared perfectly - flaky and moist, and the vegetables and sauce went really well together. My mom had the sea bass, which she loved - ate every bite - hey, I didn't even get a taste!! We also had a side of asparagus with some of the best hollandaise sauce I have ever enjoyed.

Small, intimate coffee shop located in the Highland Creek neighborhood that offers coffee, tea, and a couple of food offerings. If you're looking at the front of Harris Teeter, it's to the left.

Today I got the same thing I did the first time: House (Ethiopian) coffee with about 2tbsp half & half and 2 packets of sugar. The roast is great, and it tastes well brewed. The problem is it almost tastes watered down. Not watered down as they used too much water while brewing, that would over-extract and emphasize bitterness. Instead, it's like they took well roasted and fresh coffee and added water afterwards... Maybe I'm wrong, but it had a very weak, watery flavor.

I also tried the Pecan Pie square and good God do they need to warm this before serving.  The flavor was good enough, but I'm pretty sure I loosened a bond on my fixed retainer behind my teeth! Texture like set concrete. The nutty flavors would probably be more pronounced heated as well.

Anyways, I got the yaki udon and grabbed 2 shrimp tempura and 1 tempura fried egg. Once I paid for my food, the lady gave me a beeper to alert me when my yaki udon was done. 

Sooo...this is the part that kind of irked me. I sat at the table waiting for my noodles and waited...and waited...and waited. I probably waited a good 20-25 minutes before a nice young lady came up to me and asked me if I got my food. I told her no and that I was still waiting. She then said she'll check with the kitchen and after a few minutes, she came back and informed me they were making it now and apologized for the wait. I'm not exactly sure what happened...maybe my ticket didn't go through? It was a good thing I wasn't in a hurry. 

Onto the food, the tempura is bomb. So nicely fried and crispy without being heavy. The yaki udon was flavorful and the consistency of the noodles itself was nice. If I were to suggest one thing is to add more meat into the dish.

The Thanksgiving special of the night was your choice of turkey pot pie or sliced turkey with mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and stuffing ($38 for either option).  I went with the more traditional sliced turkey breast (free range), which was juicy and flavorful.  The stuffing was an interesting mix of the dark meat of the turkey with bread stuffing.  Unfortunately, it was very salty which made it difficult to eat.  The cranberry sauce was excellent, with just the right amount of sweet and tart flavor, and the mashed potatoes were, well, just your standard mashed potatoes (albeit freshly made).  

Prior to the turkey, I had the gnocchi appetizer, which was delicious and perfectly cooked.  In a similar vein, someone that had the French onion soup remarked that it was the best French onion soup he's ever had.

The first time I came to one was the Rainbow location mainly due the fact close to my house. It was solid experience and won me over with both pizza/pasta dishes. It been while since stop by again but after solid day of training my training partner and I decided on pizza by the slice for recovery meal. He was telling me about other location across from Red Rock Casino. I was like pizza by slice. Hell yay!! 

Unlike the rainbow location this one has way WAY more personality. The whole interior set up is much more true to a small pizza joint see in the city. The kitchen is pretty small, they have tiny market section (pasta, can sauces, and little bit of everything), and refrigerator filled with ready to go sauces take home plus few other items. As you walk towards the back of the restaurant to the dining area. It this little hallway that opens up to not very big dining area say less then fifty seats. All the stuff on the way from the photos (ton of family photos, and lot of famous landmark you know in NYC), and some artwork murals again NYC famous landmarks. The table overs with the checkerboard look screams italian. I love the vibe of the restaurant. Just fyi I was telling the guy about the Rainbow location and he told me that the ownership is not the original Rocco owner anymore. Guess he only owns this location and one other location out of three or four believe around town. Fair speaking of the pizza I feel both locations were very good. 

We got three pies all together by the slice. I only got one. The sausage and pepperoni. It was awesome. The dough really feel like was true to new york style pie. The sauce and toppings fresh. Maybe they shipped in some of that NYC water because everything about the dough was spot on and the crust addicting. The size of the pizza by the slice another true sign. It nice size. I had one piece hit the spot if had two that like eating small pizza for me. The way serve it on simple plan white paper plate. The price is super reasonable per slice. Really not many pizza places serve by the slice outside of food court in mall. If looking for legit pizza by the slice Rocco's NY Pizzeria. Da bomb.",2017-08-17 19:32:14

We ordered the spicy beef hot pot; then added quail eggs, slices of beef, slices of lamb, tofu, fried tofu, cabbage.  Each add-on cost extra, but our total bill was only $25.00.  I have only eaten hot pot at my parents house, so I have no clue if that is expensive or not.  It also came with a bowl of rice (my friend added one more bowl for $1).  Again this was unusual to me because I've never had rice with hot pot.  The flavors of everything was really good.  I hit pot had imitation krab meat and corn in the soup.

This is a ok casino. It can get pretty busy I think Locals and tourists come here cause it is not far from the strip.The table games get real packed.

Over all the casino is not bad for playing the machines. They do have some neat ones we have played.

They do have a band not sure if it is every night but they are usually pretty good. They do drawings at certain times while your playing on the machines..
If you come here to stay you won't be unhappy with the size of the rooms. We always like how big they were and always asked for a non smoking room.",2015-12-06 03:11:01

They are really good, but I was blown away by the pricing of what I ordered, but I wanted to try it. $8.99 for 6 pc chicken wing? I loved the wings, I had the poppers, and the fish in the catfish sandwich was made to perfection, but they have to redesign some of their pricing to make it reasonable. $15.00 for 2 small appetizers is outrageous... I didn't want a bunch of food. Also I drove around for 20 mins before I found out how to get into the lot. On my 2nd visit I chose the 12 pc wings for a better deal. They were a bit soggy and not as good as the 6pc. This could have been due to the release of moisture from the number of wings in the container. Another reviewer complained about this too. They may want to change this by letting the wings sit a little longer before boxing them or cooking them on a higher setting to seal the water in a bit better. They were still ok, at least not as expensive.",2017-03-04 21:08:54

The Grille is tucked into a corner of Berea, not too far from Baldwin Wallace.  Walking in from the parking lot you find a small front dining room, the service line and a larger dining area.  You place your order and pay, choose a table and they bring the food out to you.  The decor is simple, but they keep the place up nicely.

Service was friendly and helpful, the cashier answered all of my questions.  I ordered the Mofungo con Bacalao Guisado, the mashed plantains with salted cod, onions and peppers.  Be aware the Mofungo comes with pork cracklings, unless you request otherwise, as I did.  The large order came out quickly, served in an aluminum takeout container.   The plantains were good, but not as mashed as I have had before; more like chunks with some crispier parts.  The fish was pleasant, but not as flavorful as I was expecting.  Overall the dish was nice, just a bit disappointing compared to the Mofungo I have previously had.

I was also disappointed that I could not get a cup of water, they did offer to sell me a bottle of water but I find it hard to believe that a restaurant does not provide cups of water.

There's no need for an introduction to Presotea, it's probably one of the Top 5 most well-known bubble tea chains in the GTA, and they have several branches for the young adults who adore bubble tea.

I was the only person ordering from here when I arrived on a Monday afternoon. There were two employees at that time, but only one approached me and asked what I wanted. I ordered the hokkaido milk tea with tapioca, after previously trying the panda milk tea in another branch.

I'm not sure if the milk tea was supposed to not mix together, but there was a large difference between drinking from the bottom of the cup and drinking from the top of the cup. There was a lot more milk in the bottom, while the top had a strong tea taste. I gave it a shake after my first try, but still ended up with the same result. Eventually I got used to it and I found it tasted okay. The tapioca was also quite good, though I'm finding many bubble tea places around the area tend to make tapioca quite well already.

Considering the price was $4.20 and the neighbouring bubble tea places are $2.50, I wouldn't be too crazy on returning...especially if I'm not up for milk tea.",2015-02-03 01:25:48

I love the fact that they serve such fresh salmon for a buffet. It definitely taste a lot better than Joe's sushi. The albacore sushi was pretty good too and the other ones are just whatever. 

Personally I thought the hot food were pretty bad. There wasn't really one item that I love. They were either nasty or nothing special and I wouldn't try to get it again. I also tried the udon which wasn't that great to me. The udon was pretty nasty which disappointed me. 

The thing I did love about it is the fact that i can get unlimited amount of Shrimp Tempura. I am never satisfied from Japanese restaurant when they only give you 1-2 shrimp tempura but this place did allow me to get 10+ shrimp tempura. hahaha that was one good point to me.

I also like the fact that they provided 4? different kind of ice cream. I'm pretty sure they were all bought but if i can get unlimited amount of red bean ice cream thats gonna make fat and happy. 

Also didn't try the other desserts(cakes except the shaved ice) because it didnt look that great . Don't try the shaved snow...it was absolutely nasty. -_- I do enjoy the fruits since they give the chocolate fountain where I can tip my strawberries into it. I love strawberries without and with chocolate. :)

Anyway I would say this place is probably 2.75 but i must say for a buffet i thought the sushi was quite fresh. I really do enjoy the salmons that are actually fresh.

I had reviewed the menu online and was pleasantly surprised to see a number of Salmon dishes available as lunch specials.  Salmon Basil, Salmon with Garlic, Three Taste Salmon.   My head was spinning with daydreams of trying each and every one and incorporating KST into my list of go-to restaurants for relatively healthy lunch options.   Plus they have brown rice! It was love at first menu review.

Call in the order. ""We don't have salmon anymore""   Okay Chicken Basil it is, spiced 7/10.   Ho hum.  But still, brown rice! :D

When I walked in, I was surprised to see a large, extremely busy restaurant.  I don't know what I was expecting or why I was expecting it, but it wasn't that.  I actually waited for a couple in front of me to be seated and informed the waiter I had a take out order.  He was extremely efficient and friendly and got me in and out of there in about 2 minutes flat.

Back to the office the disappointments started to pile up.   First, inside the bag was simply my entree in a takeout container.  No napkins, no plasticware, no sauces, literally just the takeout container.  How is at least a napkin and fork set not a standard take out provided item?   Actually opening the entree led to more disappointment.   Their website states (along with the non-existent salmon dishes): ""Served with steamed or fried rice, egg roll, wonton, salad, and soup of the day.  Soup not included in togo order""   Well, there wasn't ANYTHING other than my entree and rice.  No egg roll, no wonton, no salad.  Now as I said before, it was pretty busy so I can forgive some oversight, but to miss out on providing 3 of the 5 components of a take out lunch special, and to not provide napkins or plasticware?   

But still, brown rice!!!!!!    Well, not quite.  For the next disappointment, the rice provided inside the 2/3 full takeout container (I assume the 1/3 was supposed to have the salad and/or eggroll and wonton) was regular steamed white rice.  

Here's the kicker, I actually enjoyed what I received quite a bit.  The chicken was nicely ground up, and the dish had a great flavor overall.  The rice wasn't as sticky as I usually like and almost ventured into Uncle Ben's like levels of separation.  The spice level was a little more intense than I usually look for in a 7, but I wouldnt mind so much if it wasn't for the other oversights.

All in all I have to go with a 2.  Had they gotten the order correct and provided me with what I ordered, it would have been a solid 3 for sure.  Brown rice :(",2012-12-11 21:24:24

  - Do not eat here for dinner.  Portions are the same as lunch and cost nearly twice as much.
  - We never get personal or really good service here.  Just mediocre.

We are ratings Gogi 3 stars but we want to elaborate.  If we were just rating the food, they get a 5 stars hands down.  The food is so good and the only thing we have had but didn't enjoy was the fish katsu.  It had way too many bones to truly enjoy.  But the bibimbap, the bulgogi, and galbi all will make your mouth water just to write about.  Yes, I'm salivating now!

The service however.  Not so great.  Seems like you need to be a ""friend of the family"" to get really good service.  We almost feel not welcome walking in.

The second complaints is the difference between dinner and lunch prices.  After originally going for a lunch and then returning for another visit at dinner time, we clearly noticed the huge bill and lack of larger portions.

After glancing at the menu (they also have a separate booklet of strictly photos of each item - very helpful), I felt comfortable ordering. Malaysian food is pretty similar to Thai food.

I ended up ordering the Ginger Scallion Chicken (vs duck) from the rice dishes. Delicious! The ginger slices and scallions were super crisp and fresh. The chicken was even tastier soaked in the sauce. The scoop of rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend starting off with this dish, as my friends both said they enjoyed it more than their own.

The wait was a bit on the longer side, considering the place was not really even half-filled. The service was on point. Oh, and there's a little pool table in the back as well as a stage that they probably use on karaoke nights if I were to guess.",2016-08-05 06:44:18

Let's start with the positives:

Our server was amazing; friendly, engaging, and fast. The ambiance was nice, though it was a little hard to read the menu (I had to use my phone light).

The apple cider was very tasty, and the fries that came with the meal were decent.

But the hero, the BBQ jackfruit, was absolutely disgusting. Hot, flavoured mush with no discernible texture, I wanted to spit it out as soon as I took a bite

Really shame, as I've heard some great things about this place, so I'd be willing to give it another try.",2015-11-20 15:44:38

It is so funny because I have tried to mimic this salad and I cannot!  My mom has and it was pretty good!  Just try it and let me know what you think!  Another few appetizers that are fantastic are the crab enchiladas, the Tiger shimp, meatballs, the pork belly and the risotto.  If you want you can have those as a meal!  
Now my favorite entree is the mushroom polenta dish!  OMG it is creamy and satisfying.  This is the only entree I get when I go here!  It is just something so different and they have just made this dish soooooooooooooooooooooooo right!!!  I have tried the ribs, but they do not touch this mushroom dish!  They top it off with cojita cheese its amazing! 
Now make sure that you save room for dessert!  The bread pudding is to die for and the blonde brownie nad if you like cobbler theirs is delicious!  You can always share desserts but do not feel bad if you want it for yourself!

The portions that the nice lady here serves her customers are very generous,truly a meal fit for a king. The amount you get is unbelievable especially when you factor in the low price ($5.00), I cannot believe this place is able to charge a low rate and stay in business, nor can I think of many places that I can get a big meal with practically every food group that will fill me up for a  low price. The flavour alone is enough to keep me as a customer, the other pluses about this place are a bonus. The coleslaw to begin with is sweet but just enough to compliment the flavours of the main attraction. I chose curry goat, as it is my go to when dining in a caribbean restaurant.The curry goat was well seasoned, juicy and meaty. The combination of the juices from the meat with the rice and deliciously sweet coleslaw makes for an unbelievable flavour combo in your mouth. The only let down with  this restaurant will be if  you where a customer of Mitchies eatery, because unlike Mitchies this restaurant  doesn't have french fries with spicy gravy. However that is the only thing they do not have. To be fair this place loses one star not based on quality, quantity or service. It loses a star for not having the fries.

After some disappointing outings for dim sum in Pittsburgh (I'm looking at you, New Dumpling House and Empire Palace!), my family and I finally came across Sun Penang in Squirrel Hill and we are so glad we gave them a chance today.

We got an assortment from the dim sum menu to get an idea of what they had to offer.  There is a pretty good selection (available from 11am-9:30pm) and the prices are reasonable.  Here's what we got:

Bean Curd Skin Roll - excellent
Shiu Mei (Pork and Shrimp) - also excellent, did a 2nd order on this one
Chive with Shrimp (Dim Sum) - great
Rice Kor (Dim Sum) - OK, great texture on the outside, a little skimpy on the filling
Steamed Dumpling - OK, filling was good but the dumpling skin was a little soggy
Coconut Cake - perfect dessert
Steamed Pork Bun - great

I also ordered the Young Chow Fried Rice from the regular menu.  This was good and it hit the spot flavorwise.  Not heavy on the white onions, great rice to meat ratio but it was a little oily.  

We went in on a Saturday lunch and the service was very attentive and friendly.  Our family can rest a little easier knowing that we found a dim sum spot in our new home in Pittsburgh!",2012-02-04 23:21:40

This place is a remodel of an old restaurant in a hotel. They did a good job on the remodel. The bar is way nicer and much better layout. I did not like the lighting which was set up on a grid under the drop ceiling and looked like a movie set. Just too much clutter when they could have a nice clean look.

They tables are terrible. They have huge bases and there is no room for your feet under the table. It felt like I had my legs wide open the entire time. Very uncomfortable! 

Service was good but food was not. 

Burgers are 8.00 with no toppings or chips or sides. They claim it was a hand made patty but it was a plain burger that was not hand made. Not to mention I ordered my med rare and it was about a 1/4 inch think and cooked well done. 

And it was served on a plain bun on a old looking diner plate. Come on! At least care about your presentation and throw some chips or slaw on the plate. Charging $1 for a slice of cheese is just stupid. 

Salads are $12 and up and not worth it.

We arrived slightly early, but were seated quickly outside.  We then waited over 20 minutes before anyone approached our table.  We were about to leave at this point.  As we started to get up, a server came to our table.  We explained that it had been 20 minutes and she apologized, so we continued.  She gave us recommendations on wine, which were both quite nice.  We each ordered a glass.  It took a very long time for the wine to come.  At 50 minutes in to our night we had our wine and still no food.  My husband left our table and went in search of bread, because we were starving.  At 1 hour and 30 minutes into our night, we only had our appetizers.  At this point, I stood up to ask for our check.  Our server said that she was bringing the food out right now and that in France they like to spread the food out over the night.  I agreed that we like to eat that way, as well, but we spent 20 minutes after we were seated just sitting there and that has pushed everything back.  I am not sure she understood.  The entrée's came out.  They were delicious.  (Although the beef beef bourguignon portion was very small (maybe a cup?), but it was incredible!)  We pretty quickly got through dessert and coffee.

The chicken was disappointing - there was technically chicken on the plate, and some of it was fried, but there really wasn't any flavor on the plate at all.

We also had a Caesar salad, baked minestrone soup and fries. The fries were perfection. Extra hot and crispy. Delicious! They were free with a yelp check in.

If the restaurant is packed, you may be stuck there for several hours.  The wait time is much better when the restaurant is less busy, however.  In addition to food, Miega offers karaoke in an adjacent room.  The room is spacious, allowing for a large party.  The equipment takes up a small corner, and the books offer an oddball mix of English, Korean, and Japanese songs.  Those interested in karaoke would be happy to note that karaoke is free with dinner, although only one room is available, so it's best if reserved in advance.",2012-03-04 06:28:14

Qw7frmEORlfSiD3Qr7AykA,TqKg5XonFWPAacSLpUNIVQ,xlMgaPOpd_99SFTuOtDH0A,3,0,0,0,"My friend and I ended up at Manitoba after watching a show that featured it as part of MTL à TABLE, Montreal's restaurant week. Walking into the restaurant, which is at the end of street filled with factories (some still functioning, some converted into condos and restaurants), the first thing you notice is how contemporary it looks, especially with its open kitchen. Then you notice that it's not just contemporary, but has a contemporary explorer theme complete with animal pelts draped here and there and logs lining the ceiling. The décor mirrors the food to a tee: hearty staples like pork chop, fried sturgeon, and squash are served with a gourmet twist. 
We barely got reservations on a Tuesday night at 9pm (remember: restaurant week), and were seated at the only free table. The hip-hop music playing when we got there quickly changed to James Brown, though I have to say the hip-hop seemed like a better fit. The lighting was dim and romantic and there were small candles glowing on our table. We got 3 choices for both the appetizer (""Peckish Menu"") and entrée (""Hungry Like the Wolf"") and 2 choices for desert (""Sweet!""). I chose the fried cod collars, the grilled pork chop, and the butternut squash panna cotta. Our waiter was very nice and recommended a bottle of white wine, but when we tasted it, it didn't seem appropriate for such heavy food, so we asked for a red and took the La Chambere D'Edouard. 
Out came my fried cod collars which were reminiscent of standard North American Friday Night Fish Fry fare. It had ample (read: AMPLE) mayonnaise-based sauce spread beneath the very fried, but still tasty, fish. Whatever I envisioned the sturgeon vinaigrette tasting like, it wasn't mayonnaise, and I could have done without it -- and with a lighter breading on the fish. My dining mate's dear heart gravlax was much lighter and tastier. 
Next was the good-sized grilled pork chop, and by good-sized I mean something that, 300 years ago, would have fed a team of explorers and their guides for a week. Covered in black elderberries and on a bed of beans and wild rice, my first thought was ""tough, but delicious."" But then, even with my friend helping me, it required so much sawing and chewing that slowly I began to regret the fact that it was so big. 22 hours later, my body is still yelling at me to become a vegetarian. Moderation makes the heart grow fonder. 
Last was the butternut squash panna cotta, which was served with delicious crouton-like chunks of toffee afloat on its creamy depths.  Though it had some exotic sounding ingredients like seabuckthorn and apple and balsam fir, they didn't stand out to me. The cool panna cotta was quite refreshing after such a heavy meal, though after the pork chop I barely had room for it. The ""northern rock,"" which my friend ordered, looked like a puff pastry served on a bed of moss and, though not mouthwateringly amazing, was good and fit the foraging/traditional Canadian/ explorer theme. 
By the time we were done with our meal, our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us, and I had to try and make eye contact about 12 different times with multiple members of the wait staff to get the check. 
My overall impression of Manitoba? Hearty portions that could easily be shared between 2 people, high-quality ingredients that could stand to be stepped up to reflect the prices, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere. Judging by the young, attractive crowd dining around us (which could be a reflection of restaurant week), Manitoba is going to be a yupster staple in this section of downtown.",2014-11-14 07:00:48

rbospFWjDakCbmtvAh8qLw,6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,3,2,0,0,"If Hakkasan the nightclub is anything like Hakkasan the Restaurant I'll probably wait to head back. There is one very common ingredient that seperates a $10-15 entree from a $30+ one - and it has nothing to do with food. That ingredient is service. I can find a $15 steak around Las Vegas almost as easily as I can find $1 bud lights. The reason I occasionally pay $40 for a steak is because the service I get at the $40 joint vs. the $10 dive is better. The wait staff is more attentive, the ambiance is nicer, it's just a fancier experience start to finish. With all of that said, while Hakkasan does have some good grub, their service is not up to par with the other high end Strip restaurants. They are probably 4-5 stars on food and 2 stars on service, for this one I'm rounding down.

Our waitress wasn't awful, but when the dining fare is $65 a head (our bill was $130 for 2) I expect my glass to remain full, the table to remain clean, and the waitress to remain present. That wasn't a regular occurance on my latest visit to Hakkasan. The food itself was pretty solid. The Roasted Chilean Sea Bass is definitely my favorite item on the menue. Sweet and flaky, this fish is not fishy at all and is cooked to perfection. We began our meal with the steamed dumplings. Very good, you get 2 of the same flavor and four different flavors. 3 of the 4 included shrimp, the other had duck - all of them were tasty. In addition to the Sea Bass we went with a Pork Belly dish. Not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't love this. Way too fatty of a piece of meat for me, though when I did get a bite of actual pork that was very good. The sticky buns that came with the dish were also really good. Our waitress had a chronic case of RBF (urban dictionary that - you're welcome). Not her fault (I don't think), but it didn't help the cause.

For $135 there is better service and better food on the Las Vegas Strip. I can't say I'd go out of my way to dine here again, nor would I want to sway someone from trying Hakkasan. It's good, just don't set your expectations too high from a service standpoint.",2014-12-01 22:51:07

I was with 5 friends and we arrived early (11:30 a.m.) on a Wednesday. We were seated promptly and handed menus. Freshly baked pita was delivered to our table shortly thereafter. We sat with our menus for quite some time until we realized we were supposed to go up to the counter to order. No one mentioned this to us and I had honestly forgotten since I hadn't been there in about a year. We were told that since we were all seated at the same table, we all had to pay at the same cashier, which seemed a little silly, but whatever...

I ordered the Greek salad with 2 appetizer falafel balls on the side. The salad was quite good, if a little overdressed. It had plenty of feta cheese and 5 Kalamata olives. The falafel were really great. They were crispy and really tasty. No complaints there.

3 of my friends ordered the fattoush salad with chicken. They all complained that there was FAR too much pita in the salad and that it was a bit greasy (the pita). They also said that their chicken was very overcooked and stringy. But they did say that the salad itself was quite tasty.

1 friend ordered the butter chicken pizza. It came on a paper plate for some strange reason. Other than the terrible presentation, she really enjoyed her meal and said it tasted great.

Another friend ordered the chicken shawarma in a pita and said it was just great. She had no complaints.

All in all, the food wasn't bad, but also wasn't all that great.

The restaurant itself is really large, with a fairly large patio for extra seating. There is also a little play area for children. Even at 11:30 in the morning on a weekday, the place was quite busy and very loud. There were a lot of children running around and being quite rowdy. There was also extremely loud music blasting which made conversation a little difficult.

The fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere (really dark, decor kind of reminded me of Black Angus) and staff (our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check) isn't enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and well-prepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks. 

I got the Movie Star Martini, and my husband got some version of the Manhattan (can't remember the name) - both drinks tasted like well-thought-out concoctions and were definitely worth the $10-$12 (which is something I cannot say for many over-priced restaurant cocktails). We started with the oh-so-famous Chopped and it was heavenly. We actually didn't like the Buffalo Carpaccio as much as we hoped we would - while the meat itself was tender and fresh, the chef had overseasoned it and the espresso and cumin flavors were overpowering. 

For our entrees, we had the pork chop stuffed with blue cheese and bread pudding and the short ribs with cherry bbq sauce. We were both impressed that the server asked if we were ok with having the pork slightly undercooked -this preparation is really the most flavorful, but many people remain uncomfortable with undercooked pork because of the trichinosis incidents of many years ago. Having it prepared this way made it so tender, and the meat's flavor was complemented by the bread pudding, figs/raisins, and flavorful sauce that accompanied it. The beef short ribs were also deliciously tender and came with a hearty but so rich serving of pecan grits. My favorite part was definitely the tangy barbecue sauce with whole cherries in it. 

Overall, this was a great (although expensive!) meal, and I am sure that we will return to Cowboy Ciao (maybe with guests from out of town) although the slightly-pretentious decor, service, and concept will probably prevent us from making this a more frequent destination.",2008-05-18 16:59:58

There are fountains outside with lots of foliage, and tons of lounging area as well. 

We decided to forgo the restaurant week menu since it didn't seem to have anything special nor worth getting compared to the regular menu.

You have to save the butter garlic sauce to dip the bread in after eating the escargots, I would purchase this sauce if they sold it because that's how good it is.

We went there for an anniversary dinner and it was definitely a dinner for a special occasion.  Not only because of the cost of the meal, but also the length and type of food too.  Our dinner lasted about 3 1/2 to 4 hours from start to finish.  The service was exceptional from the complimentary limo service, to the incredibly well trained and knowledgeable service staff.  Everyone around was was celebrating a special occasion as well, as indicated by the individual ice cream cake they would bring out for each table. (nice touch!)
So we started off the meal with two delicious specialty cocktails. Mine was the one muddled with fresh raspberries and his was a bourbon martini of some sort.  Both delicious.  We ordered the four  course tasting menu with two half bottles of wine, one red one white.  It's really a four course menu with a bread cart, cheese cart, chocolate cart, personal icecream cake for special occasions or sorbet, dessert and they also send you home with a loaf of pistachio cranberry bread. wow, it's a LOT!  
Everything that came out was visually spectacular, inventive and tasty with fancy foams and gelees.  The bread cart and cheese cart were amazing too.  My favorite dishes were probably the amuse bouche, the crab salad with caviar, and the turbot dish.",2009-10-29 09:45:38

We also got the Guacammus (guacamole and hummus mixed) and it was so good, I wanted to just eat it by the spoonful. We also had a quesadilla with shredded chicken, delish! I ate waaay too much. I couldn't help it though. I asked for a side of the chipotle creme, a must have, to go with just about anything!

When a couple of our friends arrived they ordered some more amazing drinks, a coconut margarita that is out of this world good, and more food. She had the salmon special that looked so good, but I was too full to try and he got the green chili mac'n'cheese, that I know for a fact is amazing!

Staff is nice but very slow, even when it's not busy. 

Not so great - back of the menu - drink menu is not accurate. They drop the menus and don't say anything about modifications or seasonal options. After deciding, and waiting, we found out that an entire sections of beer was ""out."" So it's kind of misleading to list a type of beer and list of options under that type, that you don't actually sell. Waitress was great at sharing about the special (what they are pushing, and want you to buy), but failed to mention much else. After failing at any beer options in the type we like, I asked about seasonals. She then took ~5-7 mins to bring that menu. After us taking our time and picking, she took the order and came back another 5 later to say that was ""out."" She then checked and said she could sub a NoDa beer instead. Ok, what? We wanted to get something different-your menu seems diverse for regions and options. I then found out it was $7 for a NoDa beer. Ya, no thanks, I can go there and pay $5. I didn't appreciate a sub option for a very unique, awesome beer as a NoDa option. I love them, but can get them all over-including their brewery-in Charlotte! 

My recommendation - go across the street to Dogwood or Corkbuzz. They are both fantastic.

As far as the noisy neighbor with the dogs/ and furniture noise.  They have asked that I call security so they can come into my apt (regardless of the hour) hear the noise and then address the issue with the neighbor.  Last night they ""couldn't hear anything""  (according to security when they went to the apt). It kind of made me feel like I was stiring things up. The woman/neighbor acknowledged the noise and even said ""sorry"" after I screamed off the balcony so I know the noise came from her! 

For the past 3 months or so the moving furniture noises starts around 10pm and has gone as late as 4-5am.  I suppose working regular hours from 9am-5pm job is irrelevant, and being disruptive to my sleep is not a big deal to Turnberry, but if this is what it takes to get my nieghbor to stop moving furniture and keep the dogs quite, then this is what I will do.

Called security around 8.30pm due to dogs yapping, loudly. I love dogs, but people that allow their poor dogs outside in the cold or let them yap uncontrollably is wrong. Security heard the dogs ...

Well I thought I would put it to the test as I can say I've had some of the best hot dogs this universe has to offer.  When you're dropping $8 on a dog, you don't want some greasy schneiders hot dog stuffed into a pair of buns.  You want something mouth watering and an experience that brings you back to your days at the ballpark, CNE, or when your grandmother used to fry you up a dog to go with your ramen noodles.  Why because we ghetto like that.

Anyway, this place looks great inside and the decor is definitely that out of a higher end restaurant.  The food however, was not as mind blowing as I would expect for the price I paid.  I picked up a Coney Island along with a few dozen nutella and original donuts on the side.  I'm fancy like that.  The dog was delicious and juicy, it made my eyes half roll to the back of my head.  The toppings however were pretty basic, and compared to a dog you can get from a street vendor, the quality was about the same.  The donuts were good, they weren't hot off the press krispy kreme good, but they tasted like your typical carnival donut from Tiny Tims.

Would I go back?  Sure why not, I love hot dogs and this place has a plethora of choices to choose from.  I think at one point I was staring so hard at the menu that I blacked out a bit and thought about how they make seedless watermelons, seedless.  Knowmsayin?",2015-09-11 18:19:03

They really need to get their act together. They have been open over a month and the employees still don't know the prices. The hostess as well as the lady doing my nails tried to charge me an extra $5 to remove my gel nails even though I am getting gel polish to replace that. I had to remind both of them that the extra price is only if I'm replacing gel nails with regular polish. This is standard practice everywhere. Not to mention, the rate card mentions $3 for gel polish removal, not $5. Also, all the silver top OPI displayed by the main entrance cost an extra $3 to get. Not sure why. The nail salon I regularly go to do not charge anything extra for those. And the regular black top OPI is not even displayed up there. 
I picked a color I wanted and asked for the gel in that... no one knew where the gel colors were! Once they figured it out, they couldn't find the color I wanted. The one I picked out was a pink shade labeled H04, the lady doing my nails picked out a yellow color, labeled I04 or something. Like, dude, seriously, are you color blind?! At least take a moment to match the color if you can't match the label!
Once the aesthetician started doing my pedicure, the water faucet suddenly went out of control and sprayed water all over the chair, my legs and a little bit of my shorts. She quickly got it under control after cussing a little and then apologized, but seriously?! Once my pedicure was done, I assumed the worst was behind me when we moved to the manicure bar. Here my nails were soaked, trimmed & filed, polish removed, cuticles cut and new polish applied, leaving bubbles all over, not sure why. When I showed it to the lady she didn't see an issue with that. Once done I expected a proper massage since that was mentioned on the rate card, but the lady just put lotion on and was done. When I asked the owner if this was what they charged the extra $5 for, her response was ""yes, we do spend time doing it, don't we?"" That's A+ customer service right there (sarcasm). I was like, ""you are saying you charge $5 for an extra 30 seconds of your time?"" --no response. My mom, who was still getting her nails trimmed decided to just get the polish change + cuticle trim then, and what her aesthetician did was no different than mine, but it didn't cost her an extra $5. Up until this time, I was thinking of giving them another chance to get their act together, but after hearing the owner's response to my questions, I doubt I will return. I'll happily go to some place that doesn't serve "" up to 2 complimentary glasses of wine per customer"" for good customer service and good value for your money. Good luck to this place.

I usually don't like going to the grocery store very much--Dave's does their best to single-handedly raise America's inflation rate and Giant Eagle, although better on prices, really doesn't have any charm to it and I believe that very few of their sales are good.

Trader Joe's, on the other hand, is a place that I could go on a daily basis. 

The *only* drawback about this place is the distance from my place in Little Italy. That's why I make sure to go to this one or the Westlake one whenever I'm even remotely close to them, because they are amazing and I always find something new and innovative on the shelves.

The prices on some products here are great, such as produce, wine, orange juice, and random other stuff around the store. I absolutely love their product selection here and never fail to be thrilled by the wide variety of flavors and products that one can purchase.

One particularly great aspect of Trader Joe's is their flower selection. I always enjoy bringing my wife new and different types of flowers from Trader Joe's...best of all, they're VERY reasonably priced too.

What you get is a fresh bagel (exciting stuff) but it is not sliced, nor is it re-toasted, and you pay for individual packets of butter or Philadelphia cream cheese (no fancy cream cheese here). They throw it in a bag with a plastic knife and send you on your way- oh yeah, the place is also cash only. 
Now the good part, these bagels are delicious! I got a chocolate chip bagel and was surprised by small pieces of orange rind strewn throughout my bagel. An unexpected but delicious surprise. My boyfriend ordered a salt bagel and they honestly gave him a pretzel! The pretzel was delicious but I'm not sure I would consider it a bagel? Overall, the experience was good- we had to eat in our car on a cold, rainy day but I think I'll stick to my NYC bagels.",2016-10-27 19:33:51
GfRtU8h9yz5ID7KoqeFKrw,F-1ClQ8bSEp2T7NSnVYNRA,szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A,5,2,1,0,"One of my all time favorite Chinese restaurants, and once which I used to frequent with great regularity when I worked in the area. Now that I've moved further North in the valley, I miss it dearly but still sporadically get the chance to stop in, and not one single disappointment in all the time I've been going there! 

The ambiance is something unique, as it looks like a big banquet hall, not so much like a restaurant, and certainly not what you expect for a typical Chinese place. It's pretty cool that they have the back wall covered in aquariums where you can see the live fish, that much is probably worth the trip if you've never been. There is a feeling that you're somehow stuck in a 1990s hotel ball room, but in some strange way, it almost feels nostalgic more than it turns you off to the place. Maybe that's just me, but it's kind of cool.

I've only ever really sampled from the dim sum, but as stated, I've never been disappointed. The food quality is always top notch and the selection is usually quite good. The lotus wrapped rice is one of my favorites, and it's not a real dim sum lunch at Great Wall unless you try this stuff. While not a fan personally, my Asian companions have always raved about the chicken feet. They taste great, it's just not my thing. The bean curd and pork dishes have always been fantastic, and their several varying dim sum offerings with shrimp are consistently fresh and absolutely delicious. It should go along way to say that as many times as I've been here, I  have never once had a bad food experience, either during or after my visits, nor has anyone I've gone with. 

Another thing the do very well here is the tea, it is always a perfect match for the dim sum and works great to clear the pallet and balance out the flavor in the food. My friends and I could spend over an hour just nibbling at our dim sum, sipping tea and enjoying the time away from the office, which is exactly what work week lunch at a good dim sum place is all about! 

If you haven't had the experience, I highly recommend checking this place out. Just be aware that they sometimes get packed, especially on the weekend and for late lunch during the week, so go early and avoid the weekends if possible. Dim sum is highly recommended, and don't forget to try the hot tea!",2013-01-03 19:59:35

Service:  (5.0)  They hit it out of the park for me.  The hostess was very nice and quickly informed us about the restaurant week menu, the later-night happy hour menu, and the regular menu (we had plenty of options).  We at ate the bar and the service was great and friendly.  Our bartender was knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks.  We had to quiz her on a few menu items to narrow down our choices and she knew everything by memory.  She also didn't try to upsell us at all, which was nice.  She was also great to talk with and a fun person in general.

Ambiance: (4.0)  It's an understated joint with dim lighting.  Nothing special, but certainly not off putting.  I could see it working for a romantic dinner or a casual meal with friends or family.

Menu: (2.0)  I'm giving it a low rating because the main menu is just too big.  the food on the menu is great, but the size is overwhelming.  The happy hour menu at the bar is short, but it focuses on a few good items such as a crudo sampler, a delicious sausage pizza, a burger, mussels, and a couple other items.  It's really just the standard fare most modern Cleveland restaurants serve, but $5 an item is a solid deal.  The regular menu, as noted, is way too big. Even so, everything on the menu sounded great and we ultimately selected a mix of menu and happy hour items: the crudo sampler, sausage pizza, tongue and eggplant caponata, and garganelli with sweetbreads and gizzards.  

Food:  (3.5 overall) Delicious!!  

The crudo sampler (2.0) was the weakest of the bunch.  It consisted of: scallops with tobiko, scallions and lemon zest; yellowtail with pesto and tomatoes; tuna with lardo; and salmon with orange, fennel, red onion and fennel pollen.  the scallop and the tuna with lardo were both perfect.  The yellowtail and salmon both seemed too fishy for something that should have a very clean flavor, IMO.  Even so, the combinations of flavors in each crudo item worked well. 

The tounge dish (4.0)  incorporates a sweet and sour eggplant caponata.  Don't read ""sweet and sour"" as some sort of Asian influence.  The caponata is actually somewhat traditional and rustic, but the slices of tongue elevate the dish a bit.  The tongue was perfectly cooked and it had a great rendered fat mouthfeel that went well with the eggplant.  The dish lacks a bit of color, but the flavor and textures more than makes up for it.  

The garganelli pasta (5.0) contains sweetbreads, giblets, radicchio, butter, parmesan and breadcrumbs (real breadcrumbs, not some canned junk).  First, the pasta was excellent.  This wasn't some dried pasta pulled from the store shelf.  This is fresh pasta made with care and skill.  Chinato does make their pasta in house, but they don't have an extruder to make things like garganelli and fusilli.  Now, I love Ohio City Pasta, but they didn't get this from Ohio City Pasta.  Whoever made their extruded pasta put an artisan touch in the recipe.  The rest of the dish was equally impressive.  The giblets had just the right amount of give in the bite and the sweebreads were cooked to perfection.  I was worried that the bitter radicchio and the butter parmesan might overpower the sweetbreatds, but that wasn't the case at all.  Everything was in perfect balance. I was happily surprised by the salt level in this dish.  Rustic Italian food tends to use a bit more salt than one might expect.  This dish kept with that salted tradition, which I liked.  A heavy hand of salt in some food can be a terrible experience, but not with this dish.

The Sausage Pizza was also great (3.5).  The crust was thin and a little crispy, with a great char.  I would compare it to a Neapolitan-style pizza, but with a bit more chew to the crust.  However, this isn't some artisan pizza from a wood-fire oven.  The sauce was simple and let the tomato flavor shine, the mozzarella was of a good quality, the were conservative with the cheese, and the sausage seemed fresh and crumbled to the perfect size.  The crust actually had a good bread flavor too--many pizza makers don't put much thought into the flavor of their dough.  It is a light crust and it's pizza in a more proper/traditional form; don't expect to get delivery-style pizza here.  

Overall, I say it was a 3.5 to a 4-star experience (I'm leaning towards 4).  Had the crudo been better, it would be a 4.5 to 5-star dinner.  This place has a lot of Zack Bruell hype, but I think it actually lives up to that hype.   I'll certainly go back to see if we get a repeat experience.",2012-03-02 14:54:11

Stopped by for lunch with a friend this week. We were in and out in about an hour and lunch for 2 (no drinks) came to about $30 with tax and tip. 
We both tried the tartines. I had the mediterranean tartine ($10) which comes with a thick layer of ""eggplant caviar"" (I was confused initially, but it's like purees eggplant), roasted red peppers, and crumbled feta. Bonus points for the option of getting half fries and half salad as your side. It's nice to be able to mix it up, especially if you're indecisive! Food was fresh, delicious, and nicely presented. 
You can add a dessert and drink to make your lunch a combo/prix fixe for $17, but it didn't seem like that good a deal to me, and I was already quite full after the tartine. 
Service was efficient and unobtrusive. The atmosphere is cozy and very French, and some of the staff are Francophone. Great lunch choice if you're in the area.",2010-07-08 13:47:50

The rice was a bit Under cooked as well.  Bryan got fajitas and he liked the fresh tortillas. The staff here just seamed like they had no idea what they were doing. It took forever for drinks and food and for empty plates to be taken away. It was just bad. For dessert we had fried ice cream which was actually the stand out for me. It was perfect.

Our friend and real estate agent decided to take us out for dinner Saturday evening to this place.  Keep in mind there are two locations, one in North York and Markham. Though parking in the front of this building can be a pain, there's plenty more spaces towards the back.
Inside, Matsuda definitely feels like you've stepped into a Japanese restaurant. The ambiance, fixtures, gigantic drum in the front is appealing to the eyes.

So when Cafe South eventually opened in the same building with very few changes, we thought we would give it a try.

Yep, nothing structural has changed. The same doors, the same hostess stand, the same tables and the same counters. The menu, on the other hand, has changed quite a lot. It's what I would call ""New York deli"" but with a Southern flavor. A wide variety of plates and meals, ranging from meatloaf to burgers to baked chicken to Thanksgiving turkey dinners. Breakfasts include the usual egg plates, but also a challah French toast and grits and biscuits. Like I said, Southern.

For dinner, I went with the meatloaf and for some reason, the brown gravy. Dumb mistake on my part. Meatloaf should be with a tomato sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was okay. But I feel like I let the side down.

I had a struggling mom when I was little so she would buy a lot of stuff here. I grew up and things got better and we went less and less. I've bypassed this for years and probably would have if it wasn't for an insistence of a friend. 

Fallen on hard times, she can survive on 99cents store stuff for food and products. Even though she is staying with us until she gets back up, she insisted we let her buy her own foods. It's amazing to me whenever someone can live on $10 of food for a week and that there are places that make it possible for someone to still eat well on so little. When I was a kid, they didn't have the produce, bread or refrigerated deli items, but if they did it probably would have saved my mom a ton of money. This branch doesn't have fresh produce, but according to my friend some of them do. This location was kept clean (I've been to ones as a kid with dusty shelves and crusty floors) and I always appreciate a fairly neat store.

I was surprised at some of the brand name stuff I found so I picked up cleaning products like Ajax, various sponges, Reynolds Wrap foil, etc. etc. This is the same stuff that I buy at the store and it would cost $2-4 for the same thing that's 99 cents only here.

 Is it weird that it blew my mind a bit?

 I just didn't expect there to be good stuff and all just some random generic products that look a bit shady (though there are quite a bit of that too!). I think I need to go more often for those kinds of things...every little savings count when you live on the fringes of ""making it"" and not ""in the money"".

I really love the new location's look.  It was a little hard to find if you have never been but after a drive by I found it on the second pass.  The building is very modern and really open inside.  Instead of the outdoor patio like the 40th st. location they have a huge Arizona room in the back.  It still has a fireplace but instead of a fire it's lit with candles.  This will be really nice for the summer months when the other patio is way too hot.  

So on to the food and wine.  I ordered the starter crab and artichoke dip which was heavenly.  For beverage I got a bottle of Lapostolle Casa Sauvignon Blanc.  It was very good and with the half off price it was only $10.50.  

On to the entree I ordered the Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa.  The salmon was good but being from Seattle I could tell it was Atlantic.  It's not necessarily a bad thing but I'm kind of a salmon snob :).  Anyways the Chorizo Arepa was very good.  It's a little sweet corn cake with Chorizo in the middle.

Dancing takes place at Blush, but if you are looking for a full-on nightclub extravaganza or need room to break out your latest dance moves, Blush is not that type of place.

First, prices are outstanding.  I asked about a particular gun I am interested in, that I saw for $869 at Scottsdale Gun Club just a few days ago. They had the exact same one at $648.  (I have a friend who is a dealer and he showed me his cost from the manufacturer is $599, so TT has an excellent price on this gun at less than 10% profit.)  There was one particular accessory I needed for a build, and SGC had it at $179.  It was $119 at Tombstone.  I wound up cancelling an order on another accessory I ordered online because I found it cheaper at Tombstone.  Very impressed.

Next, service was outstanding.  Staff was very helpful without being pushy in any way. I had questions, they had answers.  

They did mention that there is an unadvertised and unspecified veteran discount on some items, and varies based on what kind of room they have to work with in any particular item.  It's worth asking about if you're a veteran, though.

Brunch on a Sunday morning.  Seated promptly.  Chips and salsa - really good!  Loved both types of salsa offered.

The crab cake, however, was mushy, thin, and I could barely taste any crab.  A spoonful or two of potatoes (but they tasted ok) ... and the best part of the meal - a cinnamon fried tortilla with fruit.  The complementary Bloody Maria was good.

And I saw Thailicious. I decided to pick something up from them after my appointment. I walk in and it's a very nice and clean place. The people were very friendly. So so far so good and this place has quite a few good reviews. I ordered off of their vegan portion of the menu. For my vegan folks lots of choices mainly all of them have tofu. I'm sure you can request the tofu to be withheld as I don't like tofu either. But you do have quite a few choices. I chose the Vegan egg rolls and the vegan pineapple fried rice. It took about 12 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I received my food. So that wasn't that bad. paid for my food and it cost $16.22. Looking at the food it was very tasty looking. I first started with the egg rolls because those are my favorite. They were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. They were just whatever to me.. they weren't bad and they weren't great. They were just regular egg rolls. I also ordered their pineapple fried rice. Again it wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. Maybe I'm a bit stereotypical when it comes to Thai food. I expect big bold flavors and spice to clear your nasal passage. This wasn't spicy at all and 
was just okay tasting. I feel a bit let down and Desiring Thai food because this place just didn't hit the spot. maybe they have different chefs at different times. I don't know.... my apologies Thailicious! I don't like to give low ratings.

I'd just returned from doing aid work in Africa so my funds were limited...Then I got there and Jamie and the owner started fussing over my hair and recommending this and that. I was then told it would be $210. I said that was too much, just the highlights please without any conditioners. That's $140. Ok. Then Jamie said, ""but just so you know if you need a toner after we can't do it as the $140 is highlights and highlights alone."" Never in my life have I gone anywhere where they wouldn't throw in something a little extra to earn a new regular customer and a five dollar toner wouldn't have killed them. Jeez. So being still jet lagged and emotionally exhausted as I gotten home from Africa to find my abusive ex who I had kicked out had been jacking up my credit cards, neglecting my cat so bad it died in my arms, I was exhausted and started crying as I felt I was being squeezed for money I didn't have. The owner snips at me, ""you need to calm down.  There's customers here and you're making a scene"". Wow. Heartless little jerk. If I ran any business and someone was crying, I would take a moment to comfort them and make them feel better. His coldness towards people and lack of compassion will not serve him in the long run. And a side note, the place was like a warehouse inside with terrible lighting and a very uncomfortable atmosphere. I'd personally go elsewhere but to each their own.

Update- I did not raise my voice and demand discounts Todd. You know you're being untruthful by putting it that way. After your stylist Jamie told me that my $140 would be for highlights and highlights alone and that if I needed a toner it was basically implied that I would not be able to get one,  my instant reaction was to put my head in my hands and start crying and that was when you came over and proceeded to read me the riot act. Trying to get someone to plunk down another $70 for a conditioning treatment is LUDICROUS. I learned many years ago a good hairdresser does not need to break the bank. The best stylist I ever had before she left town, was $90 for cut and color every two months. Granted, that was in about 2011. Let's allow for a little inflation to be fair. How does 5% a year sound? Heck, let's go for 10. That's an increase of $36. $126 for cut and color. I've already private  messaged you about my other thoughts on stylists as a whole. I have had numerous terrible experiences in the 14 years I've been in this country and I'm going to say here what I private messaged you is that stylists overseas are put through a four year apprenticeships. Not just a wam Bam six-month course.  I've had people fry my hair in this country I've been give me chemical hair cuts,  I've been given less than satisfactory work numerous times. I can honestly tell you in my lifetime in my home country I never ever once went to a salon and had a bad experience. I'm speaking from a place that you cant understand. You haven't lived overseas in Australia, I have.  Your stylists may very well be excellent and I'm not saying anything to the contrary all I'm simply saying is you need to try and use empathy in your business practices and not be so damned judgemental just because someone throws out a word here or there that you don't like. I've never had a salon not throw in a toner if needed at the end, just in the name of customer service and earning new business. I'm frustrated and sick of having bad hair dressers and I use a curse word every now and then.  You don't???? Ever?? I'd say so...you're human, as am I. But I give back and make a difference in this world and at the end of the day that's all that matters. You were cold and insensitive and I stand by that. Domestic violence victims would do well to understand that this is not a salon that is compassionate to women that have been through such a thing as I have.

We purchased our last two cars from dealerships in Waukesha prior to them adding this location in Madison.  We were pleased when they opened here as it's very convenient for getting work done on our Honda Civic.

When they first opened they had generous coupons for the service area and even honored expired coupons.  Service was top notch and we never even considered going elsewhere.

The muffler recently went out on our 2007 Civic and we headed in there to get that replaced.  First we were shocked that there was now a fee even to check/verify the issue.  Sure we'd expect that if we weren't going to follow through with the repair, but on a 9-year-old car a dead muffler was no surprise so we just fully expected it just to get fixed.  This new fee doesn't even get rolled into the repair.  The service manager explained the mechanics want to get paid, and I understand that, but why not just price the repair itself accordingly?

We were pleased in the end they did waive that fee for us after expressing our frustrations.  It's nice they still value their customers and want to keep us.  Or maybe they realized all they needed to do was listen to the car and it was pretty obvious the muffler needed to be replaced.

Anyway, $415 later we have a new muffler.  For normal maintenance things like this, I think we'll shop around a bit now.  On a 9-year-old car we don't need Honda branded parts though we certainly want parts made for the Honda.",2016-08-13 18:05:27

Five50 has a grab and go counter where pizza is sold by the slice and then a dining room for a sit down meal. We chose to go with sit down service. 

The Mozzarella Bar immediately appealed to me so we started with that as an appetizer. The three of us shared Buffalo Mozzarella, Burrata, and Chorizo Rioja. Along with our selections were bread, a nice stone ground mustard, candied nuts, and pickled vegetables. Everything on the plate was delicious. The chorizo was tasty and obviously a nice quality meat. The Mozzarella was my favorite of the cheeses, but the Burrata was nice and creamy. My only suggestion might be more bread to go with all of the cheese and accompaniments. 

The Gotham Pizza was delicious. The crust had a nice crisp and the crust was just thick enough to hold the meaty toppings. The cheese on the pizza had a nice flavor.

I was not!  We ended up going late in the afternoon on Christmas Eve.  Despite the fact that the Steelers were playing, the place was only one-third full so we got in right away.

While the menu burgers all sounded great, I decided to do the ""meat your maker"".  I had the black peppercorn rub on ground sirloin topped with field greens, tomato, red onion, and cheddar with their homemade mayo.  You can choose three ""doneness"":  bloody, pink, and none.  I'm a medium-well girl so I just noted that on the little card you use when you create your own burger (since I didn't know if that fit into pink or none category).

The burger for me was done perfectly:  just enough pink in the middle and mega juicy.  The bun was freshly made and since they buttered it and then grilled it on the flatiron, it was similar to texas toast (yum).  The rub was a good complement to the meat, and the toppings were fresh and wonderful.

The burgers come with homemade chips, a mix of russet and sweet potato.  At first, I thought I'd spring for fries, but honestly the chips are really, really good:  lightly seasoned with a bit of pepper and sea salt and went well with the burger.

Service was prompt and efficient and she did a great job explaining the menu and all of the variations/options.  For what you get and the quality of the ingredients, the meal is quite affordable.

I (as it turned out wisely) thought that a milkshake and a burger would be too much.  I think the next time I go I'll split a milkshake with someone to have with my meal.  They all looked fantastic.

How does this compare to Tessaro's?  The burgers at Tessaro's are a tad bigger (maybe by a healthy ounce) and while the meat quality is similar.  You can taste the smokiness from Tessaro's wood fired grill.  However, Tessaro's does not use a rub, so you get a different flavor from a Burgatory burger which is a different taste, but to my pallet, just as good.  Tessaro's home fries edged out Burgatory's side of chips.  So the verdict for me is that Tessaro's is just a hair better--but Burgatory is also very, very good.",2012-01-05 14:56:48

Service was efficient, if not a little cold (though I prefer that to overly smiley servers who make off jokes and bad small talk).

Also, they have a black curtain/cloth right behind their door, which makes it look completely dark inside the restaurant when looking in, so just push the door to come in, even if it looks closed and dark inside!",2016-01-31 00:35:49

I was not impressed with the fact that the waiter took the order from the table of reasonably attractive females right next to me and then walked off failing to notice my existence.  It took another guy on the floor who happened to walk into the area to ask if I'd been helped yet.  I didn't see my guy until he went to check up on the ladies and then asked if my meal was ""hot enough"" (guessing someone told the pony-tailed slob that he'd missed his table).  I then only saw him again when it was time for the bill (and I had to wait about 10 minutes for that after the bus person had taken my plate away).  He still got a greater than 10% tip...which is more than was deserved I do believe.  

Other than that...I thought the Pad Thai I had, small serving, ordered ""medium spicy"" was quite flavorful and still had more of a kick than I was expecting.  Maybe when my wife and I visit some other time the slobs will pay attention...they apparently only have eyes for the female species (really tempted to only give 3 stars...the service really ticked me off).  

I was tempted with the drink menu...but decided I'd been spending too much on ""food out"" lately so stuck w/ just the water.  Anxious to try a couple drinks on the menu though.",2010-05-18 03:51:25

It was no Suite Lorain after all. But as the vintage scene dried up, this place has held on and become the leading light for retro crap for all of Cleveland. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE everything in this place. It takes hours to fully appreciate all their goods. Heading to their basement is like a trip to the bowels of a treasure laden pirate galleon. The furniture, beer ephemera, old Playboys, etc are my bread and butter. But I realized something about myself today: I don't need any more old crap.
Tried to find one key piece to inspire a bedroom remodel and came up empty handed. A cool chair or maybe a sculpture of some sort? The beer signs were all amazing! Currently have a modern pub motif going in my kitchen. So the awesome Ballantine signs I was eyeing are more Beachland Tavern than XYZ that I'm going for. Had to sadly leave those behind. The records section is immaculately reorganized and vinyl junkie friendly, but let's face it, I have way too many of those. Wanted to get a cool coat for wifey, but she said no vintage because bed bugs. Furniture was amazing, but I already have too many pieces at home I don't know what to do with. 
So ultimately, I left without buying a thing(thru no fault of the business). I've just moved past the retro phase in my life. I own a 1940's home, so yeah, retro stares me in the face daily. It makes me sad. Cuz I really want to buy everything here, just can't rationalize it. So, if you are a young cat just starting out on your own, this is the place for you. You will find something for sure. Me, I have to be extremely selective. But keep doing your thing Flower Child. Maybe someday we will come to that big purchase that just makes a space.

We strongly prefer the normal size sushi and aren't fans of paying for a more expensive roll only to find out that it has more rice than the other rolls.  If a piece of sushi takes more than a bite, I'm not as big on it.  I like a roll to encapsulate all the flavors, not to get a little of this and a little of that in two bites.  That being said, wasn't a fan of the 'Dancing Eel'.  

Service was definitely sub par and the place is crazy noisy.  We plan to go back another time and will try the outdoor seating.  Also, the protein bomb looks great as it's hard to screw up nagiri.  The Cowboy was okay and the dumplngs were average dumplings.

Our most recent visit to Rock Bottom brewery was on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was not very busy. We were seated immediately and waited on immediately. 

My husband ordered a $4 flight of drinks on special. He enjoyed each one, especially the Wintercrush, which was suggested by the server. I really liked the Irish Pearl, which is a dark dry Irish stout. It had notes of smoke, wood, and coffee, which I really enjoyed. 

For my meal I ordered the ribeye, medium. It was cooked slightly medium-well around the edges of the steak. There was very basic seasoning on it, so it was just a steak. Nothing special, no seasoning that stood out. I added shrimp to my steak for $3.99. The shrimp were a severe disappointment. They were extra small shrimp, and they lacked any seasoning. They were also overcooked, so they were curled up into tight little balls. 

As for my sides I ordered the green beans (seasonal vegetable), and the apple coleslaw. The green beans were also bland. No seasoning on them at all. They could have used a little garlic or onion or something. The Apple slaw was average as well - it was a standard mayo based slaw, with a few pieces of Apple here and there. I feel like more vinegar would have brightened it up and allowed the Apple to come through more in the dish. If I had to give this meal a letter grade, I would give it a C. 

My husband ordered the fish and chips, with a side of Apple slaw. The fish was tasty, moist and cooked well. The Cajun remoulade was really good, and added a nice touch to the meal. The fries (chips) were standard fries seasoned with a Cajun season salt. I'd say his meal was better because it was better seasoned. 

All in all we had a good experience, but the food wasn't anything to get excited over. I would probably return for the pub-food and drink specials, but wouldn't come back if I were in the mood for steak.",2018-01-11 02:19:23

And by light I mean fire ... they had a huge fire pit outside so just like a fly I was attracted to it. After glancing over the menu posted out front I was sold.

From the outside it looks like a traditional pizzeria minus the fire pit but once you walk inside  the decor is pretty funky with multi-coloured lamps hanging, funky art deco chairs and drawings, and a wall made of hanging photographs down the center of resto.

We were seated towards the back of restaurant beside a wall lined with fake grass / turf? With the game being projected on the back wall.

Anyways on the food which totally hit the spot!

To start we noticed everyone ordering the bruschetta which looked pretty tasty but we decided to be a little different

Polenta bruschetta - Grilled pecorino polenta topped with roasted cherry tomatoes.
Super yummy love bruschetta & polenta so the combo of them together was sensational. I also loved the bits of breadcrumb topping the cherry tomato bruschetta mixture for added crunch plus with a hardy shaving of pecorino you can't go wrong there.

Polpettine Piola - Four beef meatballs with tomato sauce and shaved Grana Padano
Sooo juicy and flavourful they definitely know how to make a good meatball here and the rich tomato sauce to dip every morsel in was also really delicious.

Capricciosa - Mozzarella, ham, mushrooms and artichokes. 
Great combo of flavours, fresh and ample topping, super thin but crunchy crust. I have to say it was a pretty stand out pie!

And for dessert.....

Dolce & compagnia
Gelato, mascarpone cream, chocolate chips, biscuits, raisins
Like cold stone creamery with an Italian spin. Delicious creamy gelato with an assortment of toppings mixed in. Loved all the different textures from the chewy raisins to crunchy biscuits and morsels of  chocolate.

Overall a really great meal from food to service plus they give you a bottle of chili and garlic oil table side. I drizzled them on everything! I was totally tempted to put them in my purse at the end of the meal! I would definitely return here for some tasty Italian fare!",2012-11-10 20:06:37

I'll be nice and +1 star for the ephemere cherry I had. I'm not a big beer person, but my friend said i might like it, and it was probably my favorite beer I've tried ever. Straight up fruity with a very refreshing finish. It's probably not for everyone, but it was for me.

Phillip is the manager and he opens the business and checks messages most of the time except if he is in the office at times.

Was not expecting alot based on my first impressions.There was no one to greet and seat us upon walking in, and the menu was displayed on the wall like a fast food drive-in. I yelled ""hellloo?"" into the kitchen and someone finally came out and sat us and gave us menus. I was very glad to see vegan options for myself and ordered the veggie spring rolls and veggie pho. My husband ordered the pork banh mi, shrimp and beef spring rolls and beef pho. 

Service was lacking, the guy seemed more interested in playing apps on his phone behind the podium than takin care of us and we had to get up and walk over to him twice to ask for refills. Luckily the food made up for it! My tofu was still warm in my spring rolls so i know they made it fresh to order and the proportion of the vegetables and noodles in the roll was excellent. My husband was not so lucky, his beef and shrimp spring rolls were cold like theyd been sitting in the fridge waiting to be ordered. 

Generous servings of pho and rich deep broth, you could tell itd been simmering for hours to get the layers of flavor it had. I really didnt even need to put in any sriracha or hoisin, it stood on its own well. My husband loved his banh mi so much he got another one to take home for later. warm crusty french bread with pickled veggies and bbq pork, didnt blame him. Wish they offered a  vegetarian version of the banh mi

Waited a long time to pay and close our bill out, despite only 2 other tables being in there
 We eventually had to just get up and bring our check up front to him because we were just waiting too long for him to come collect it.

HOWEVER we were given different arrival time options at different costs. We went with 'by 10:30am' for just under $50..could of went with a 'by noon' for cheaper but wanted it ASAP.

I've been here for no wait and close to 2 1/2 hour waits.  I was skeptical at first when I heard those wait times but after that first experience I was sold. If you have a wait, go next door to Barnes&Noble to hangout. If you don't like waits, maybe try a different location as this one is pretty small. Or you can try sitting at the bar. It's first come first serve.  They have a pretty decent craft beer selection.

I've had several specialty burgers like alligator and duck but typically build my own with either Wagyu or Bison.  I love the Diablo rub, onion straws and horseradish cheddar. Those typically find their way onto my burger but I'm always switching it up. My advice is don't overload it because then you miss out on flavors. 4-5 toppings aside from your cheese and rub is probably good.  The fries can be hit or miss sometimes but I typically get a side of Sriracha Romulade to dip them in. The Chips that come free with the burger are excellent!  The Jalapeño Cornbread is a must try! Just make sure they warm the butter for you.  I normally get a shake to go (I can't eat a burger, fries, cornbread and shake in one sitting...I tried once and was miserable after)and really like the Fluffer Nutter Butter. You can always ask what their special is. I've had a few hard shakes and like Gran-Dad's Secret.

I was disappointed my last visit to find that they got rid of banana ketchup and Bangkok Steak Fries. They were both 2 of my favorites but didn't see them on the menu anymore. The waitress suggest I try the honey habanero sauce instead and it was pretty good. But those Bangkok Steak Fries and Thai peanut sauce were to die for!

Most of the time the staff is quick, attentive and friendly but like anywhere, sometimes you get a bad one. I've never had a major problem at this location. Not enough that it ruined my experience and I wanted to complain at least.  It's always been clean and looks well taken care of.

This place isn't cheap if you go all out.  You might have to wait a decent amount of time for a seat. If either of these two things turns you off then save yourself the frustration.

As far as the food goes I was not disappointed. I chose to go with the sashimi of the day which was salmon along with a house salad. The sashimi was good, but not anything too different than you're typical sushi joint. The salad was very good too. It was a much bigger portion than I expected and the dressing had a very light ginger flavor. My coworker had the meat and cheese plate which looks awesome. It had a few different cheeses including Brie, blue cheese and Gouda along with some prosciutto, salami and some homemade pickles.

We decided to find a Filipino restaurant and see if it could compare to our mom's famous cooking (nothing ever does though, right?)

We had the choice between Casa Filipina and Halo Halo Kitchen which are only a few blocks apart. For no known reason we decided to go with CF if only for the fact that it was closest to us at the time. This is not in our home area so it's unfamiliar territory for us but we ventured on until we found it in a run of the mill shopping plaza with a Big Lots (a nice bonus since it was actually open on Easter so we got to do some after lunch browsing).

We didn't know what to expect from CF but we know we weren't disappointed. The small bakery opens up into a pretty good sized restaurant with a good amount of tables. There were several other parties there including what looked like an after church Easter family gathering of about 12. Good sign #1.

We were greeted warmly and seated right away. We were surprised at the menu choices and excited about the options they had. Of course, there are some Filipino dishes we wished they had but hey, you can't have everything. What they did have was pretty darn good.

We ordered the sisig [see-sig] (sauteed bits of pork with onions) and the pancit malabon [pon-sit muh-law-bone] (noodles with sauce, hard boiled eggs, shrimp and cruched chicharon, or pork rind chips, on top). I also got sago to drink (sweet syrupy drink with tapoica pearls and sweet rice jelly) b/c it made me think fondly of family parties when my dad would always make a punch bowl of the stuff. 

The food was flavorful and offered good portion sizes. It came with a hefty scoop of white rice, naturally. The entrees also come with a piece of sweet rice bread called puto - i know, i know, not the best name for those of you who speak Spanish but that's what it's called, really! Random factoid: I learned this little double meaning when I got in trouble in 3rd grade for bringing puto to my class for the multicultural pot luck. Much explaining was done at that time too so I figured I'd include it here. Just an FYI.

One thing to note is that the food will take a little while to come out so be prepared. The server warned us in advance and was very apologetic about the wait but I have to say this....every Filipino restaurant I have been to that has heat lamps and premade food has been wrong on so many levels. Legit Filipino food is not quick to make and not good when you make it in large batches and just have it sit there waiting for someone to order it. So, just be patient and know that it's worth the wait. 

Since we are constantly trying new places we will surely be trying other Filipino joints in the area but we will also be going back to CF for some good food to make us feel at home.",2011-04-26 03:22:13

CUSTOMER SERVICE
Buuuut I am a wordy nerd. And I have to give really give props to the customer service here. We showed up on a Thursday for lunch and had the fortune of sitting in Robert G's section. Showing an excitement level I don't think I've seen in a server *ever* he walked us through the delightfully robust menu. My taste buds salivated at the many options. Robert G. got more worked up as I ordered my porter beer. (They stock an excellent porter on draft! Deschutes Black Butte). When someone shows that much passion for their work it rubs off on everyone. 

OYSTERS | GET'EM!
Based on Robert's elocution and delivery we, of course (!), had to sample some Boston oysters from Cape Cod. Oysters come with many accoutrement options beyond cocktail sauce and horseradish. We were sold on the jalapeño mignonette. It's this green, spicy heavenly goodness. The vinaigrette comes consists of cilantro, cucumber, shallot, jalapeño + red wine vinegar + v.oil.

I'm sighing thinking back to how delightful an experience it was slurping my little raw guys down. I'm from the east coast. This Phoenix locale delivers raw oysters superbly. Had I not already placed a food order I could have contently eaten oysters the rest of the afternoon. (I'll come back and do just that.) GOOD STUFF.

ENTREES | MM MMM!
My friend and I ordered at the polar opposites of the palate menu. I went for something spicy (Jamalaya). She did something rather sweet (Pork Carnitas). Both were excellent. I'd enjoy either in a heart beat again. Warning: the portions are ginormous! When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The Jamalaya is just that!

The bar is super! It's a central feature of the restaurant. Plenty of seats for everyone. Comfortable for anyone to dine solo. And (!) a number of televisions up high were showing work related content. (I imagine that changes depending on the hour.) I just really liked how unobtrusive they were.

On our way out we noticed there were booths in the interior area of the restaurant. Something to consider checking out. The outdoor patio looks fab!

She picked it because there was a good coupon in the paper for the kinds of foods she likes - seafood, southern food, bit of Cajun influence. As this was her birthday dinner - we didn't argue.  Even after looking at their web site.  Oh, what you'll do for family...

The parking lot was packed, but the restaurant had only about 5 tables occupied on this Saturday night at 7pm.  I meant to check out the bar as it must be the slamin' Mesa hot spot based on all those cars.  The Aunt tells me that they were having all you can eat ribs in there from what she heard.  

We walk in and immediately the 4 of us under the age of 50 start either giggling or staring in open mouthed wonder. To your immediate left - case of lovely knives for sale.  Forward and to your right - some inspirational cards.  A few more steps and there are stuffed animals galore for your viewing and purchasing pleasure.  To your left as you keep walking are some lovely sparkly mini-purses. View straight ahead and you'll see a shelved display of fairy figurines for sale.  (Not until we were walking out did we see the hand painted Jesus or the hand painted Pope John Paul with Mother Theresa figurine. At only $45 bucks it was quite the bargain.)  We were tempted to run until we heard The Aunt say, ""Oh, this is nice"".  Reminder - why we are here...

The hostess takes us into the room of our dreams - the one we'd seen on line and actually wanted to sit in for the pure giggle factor.  They have a giant tree in the center of the room.  Yes, ...yes they do. (See the picture to check it out in all it's glory.) You can sit under the tree's silk leaves and flowers - and even the bird house.   We were led to the table in the corner with its own white weave walls.  And a gigantic fish on the wall right above The Aunt's head.  We couldn't have asked for more. 

The menu is varied.  There is a wide variety. Their special that night actually inspired her to not use her coupon - Lobster tail, King crab leg and fried shrimp (with a soup or salad, baked potato and veggie) for just $16.  Who isn't impressed at that price?  I got one of their other specials - Fillet Mignon with shrimp (bacon wrapped, stuffed, fried, or scampi) with all the fixins for just $12. How can you screw that up too badly, right?   Someone else branched out to try their frog legs with red beans and rice.  None of us were waiting to be impressed, but we were just curious.

During our 20 minute wait for salads and our most likely total 45 minute wait (ordering to plate) time for dinner we did a great job of keeping each other entertained.  We're a bit of a lively group.  We aren't shocked to be louder than your average table as our group of 5 is filled with loud laughers and generally funny folks.  In this place though - it was shocking. No background music.  No background noise.  In a not too large room we hardly heard anyone else talking.  Another waitress (whom we wish we'd had as she was a hoot, and actually stopped by several times to tell us a joke or comment about the good time we were having) joked about how we'd gotten far too quiet (as one does when telling dirty jokes in Mesa) and she was relying on us to put some sound in the place.  

And finally to the food.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't awful.  My medium well fillet was super dry well and only about 1/2 to 3/4 an inch thick.  A chewy hockey puck.  The bacon wrapped shrimp weren't awful - but were far over cooked and dry.  I was told the frog's legs weren't bad at all.  The red beans and rice had only a theory of spice - but they are most likely well suited to the older Mesa crowd. The Aunt loved her food.  This means nothing to most of you - but The Aunt has been in Arizona for a year, and we've taken her to many great spots and they've done nothing for her.  This is the first one that she's really, really liked.  Really.

Service wasn't great.  Wasn't awful, but we really got the slow server.  One nice thing - for just $3 they brought out a individual sized cake (about 4 inch round) all frosted up nicely with a candle and we all sang Happy Birthday.  They weren't super slick about it so she knew something was going down, and the cake had obviously been made long ago and defrosted (cracks in the side) - but it looked nice to her and that's all that mattered.

If you have high culinary sensibilities - drive on by.  It's not your kind of place.  If you're looking for a cheap seafood alternative without too much focus on quality - it isn't too bad.  If you're looking for a great spot to take pictures for your MySpace profile - it's totally worth it.

2.3 stars from me.  But I'm letting The Aunt's interest bump it to a 3 star review.  (Happy Birthday!)",2008-01-14 20:28:32

This place is adorable. I was greeted warmly and was cheerily served even after I told her I was just in for the free cupcake deal. Great customer service.

As for the cupcakes, well, full disclosure, I'm a complete cupcake snob so...

The cupcakes have a TON of icing on them. I'm not a particular fan of icing so that was a negative for me, but my daughter, that was great! And the icing was way too sweet.

The cake itself was moist but really lacking in flavor.

And they are expensive. $3.50 for a cupcake is a little ridiculous. 

Their packaging and decor is adorable but I feel like they focused too much on the package instead of using quality ingredients.

The atmosphere is much nicer than many other Thai restaurants that I've been to and the curry can't be beaten.  My favorite is the Arizona Heatwave, which I typically order ""very spicy"" with tofu.  To translate, ""very spicy"" at Malee's means that there's good flavor and spice for someone who typically likes spicier food without being so overpowering that one's mouth is simply burning so badly that the actual flavors of the food are masked.  The dinner portion is definitely quite a bit larger than the lunch portion, so if you're looking to take leftovers home, you'll want the larger size.  The tofu spinach pot stickers are also a great appetizer and are served with a variety of tasty dipping sauces.  The only real negative that I've encountered food-wise is the peanut dressing that comes on the salads by default.  It's so heavy and the salad is just drowning in dressing to the point that it's impossible to taste the salad itself.  That problem is easily remedied, however, by asking for the sesame ginger dressing which is much lighter.

While I've never attended, Malee's offers cooking classes once a month at which they provide instruction on how to make some of their signature dishes.

You can go healthy (fruit bowl and some oatmeal) but there's not a lot of fun in that, is there? You can do healthy at home. Be a man, ladies, and order one of the ginormous breakfast platters. I'll split it with you.

Ample portions like Sofia Vergara in a tube top, y'all. Your plate is about as big around as a steering wheel and there's no vacancy on it. 

They make a damn good chicken-fried steak and there's enough of it to share. If you order the ""Big Foot"" version, there's enough to feed two adults with leftovers. It comes with a few eggs cooked to order, hash browns and biscuits. The biscuits are made in house and they are quite remarkable. The omelets are also huge and delicious. The hot sauce on your table goes well with eggs.

Bottom line, you're paying for beautiful plates of ""contemporary"" cuisine unjustified by the quality of the ingredients.  In other words, want to impress a non foodie, this is your kind of place.

To start, the ""Hot Rocks"" (Japanese style of cooking thin slices of beef on super heated stones), fun but it's USDA choice at best and a chewier sirloin cut.  Not much internal fat, marinated in an acidic ponzu, olive oil mix causes the protein to tighten up even further.   Fun and visually cool but misses the mark. The tuna tartare, much better.  Deconstructed at service, mix everything up to enjoy.  Everyday sushi grade tuna mixed with well toasted pine nuts, crisp Asian pair and some soy with a hint of horseradish on toast points.  Refreshing and texturally interesting.

For mains, no mention is made on the quality or aging of the beef.  It appears to be USDA top choice, not prime.  Steaks are well trimmed.  Cooking temperatures off.  The tomahawk rib eye cooked mid well when ordered mid rare (twice) was OK.  Not as tender as it should be.  Good bitterness from the wood burring grill but lacking intense beef flavor of a well aged piece of beef.  The menu says 24oz but a lot of that weight is the bone.  Maybe 12oz of actual beef.  The bone in Brooklyn fillet is OK.  Cooked to temperature.  The bone, slightly cut away from the beef for looks fails to impart sufficient flavor as dry aged versions of the same cut.  

Pet peeve:  they put a pat of COLD butter on top of the steak.  Am I supposed to rub it around in the beef drippings and make my own sauce?

Correct sides.  No real standouts.

Good happy hour where you can try scaled down versions of the starters for $9.

Good wine list.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Smoke and mirrors a bad thing?  Hey, you're in Vegas aren't you?",2013-07-13 05:15:33

The location is still fairly new, and you can see all the way to the back of the kitchen. Every time I have peeked, things always look clean and nice. Service is good, and if you dine in, they do check on you to make sure you are enjoying your meal.

The main thing I can tell you about Wan Wan is their product can be a little spotty. Hit-or-miss, if you will. For example, a few dishes like their Hot and Sour Soup, Pad Thai, Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings and Combination Chow Mein are great. Balanced flavors, fresh and filling. 

But then I will order something else and it won't be what I was expecting. Like, the Mu Shu Pork, Sesame Beef and the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce were all misses. Somewhat inconsistent.

Another inconsistency was the Boba Smoothies. I used to rave about them all the time, because short of driving all the way to Chinatown, these were a gem! They were actually close enough to me to not have to make that annoying trip. But the last time I visited, I ordered my usual fave, a Taro, and it was watered down to hell!

We yelped around and saw this place and decided to check it out. It's a rather standard suburban sushi place in the Arrowhead area. We got there about 8-9 pm that night, and the place was almost empty. Service was prompt and efficient, and we were seated quickly with menus in our hands.

The drink selection was... okay. I got the watermelon martini, which was good, but truthfully nothing to write home about. I ordered some tempura udon, and the shrimp tempura was crispy and fresh, but the broth a bit too high on the sodium content. The sushi rolls we got were nice, but not immensely creative. Well made though, with decent fish. I did ask to order my favorite- ikura nigiri, and they unfortunately didn't have it. I got ebiko nigiri instead, at her suggestion. Not my favorite, but a decent substitute. Fish eggs are fish eggs. 

The one noteworthy thing that I did enjoy was that they had a good number of rolls with 'white tuna', or escarole. My husband and I love it. But if you do your research and google it you will know that it doesn't always agree with everyone, especially if eaten in large quantities. So reader beware- you may NOT have a nice reaction to it, and really that differs from individual to individual. Neither myself or my husband have ever had a reaction, and we enjoy eating it every time we see it in on a menu.

I prefer round tables for groups because it's easier to talk to everyone at the table.  We had to wait a bit for everyone to arrive.  The waiter was great at this time.  Promptly greeting everyone and asking if they wanted a drink.  He was like this the entire duration of the meal, always making sure we were satisfied and didn't need anything else.  I was happy that they had a rose on the wine menu.  I love rose wine, and do not often see it on the wine list.  

For the meal I started with a small caesar salad.  For my main I had the mac and cheese with chicken and pees.  Mac and cheese is my favorite dish, so I always like to try it at different restaurants.  No complaints on the caesar; it was nice and fresh.  

The mac and cheese was different than what I was used to, but not in a bad way.  It wasn't a strong cheddar flavour, but still very tasty.  It had breadcrumbs sprinkled on top which gave it a nice texture.  I have never had peas and chicken in my mac and cheese.  I didn't know if I'd like it, but am sure glad I tried it because it was delightful!  I would recommend this dish to any mac and cheese lover.    

There were a lot of dishes on the menu that I wanted to try so I will be coming back to this restaurant again.  The service was fantastic, and the good was great.

What I initially thought was a novelty isn't entirely a gimmick but one that also creates a unique kind of ice cream. The result is a fresher tasting ice cream, though I can't entirely vouch that it is more creamy or smoother in terms of texture than regular ice cream. 

So the main premise of CoolN2 is a visual spectacle combined with some freshly made ice cream made to order. It's awesome to know and see your ice cream being made right in front of you! But unfortunately that does mean the wait can get long. On my most recent I decided to get their strawberry ice cream and it was pretty good! The strawberry flavor is very prominent in a good way and the ice cream was denser than I expected. Though that isn't a bad thing (think haagen daaz). The texture was mostly smooth aside from some lumps but it was still a very enjoyable cup of ice cream. 

I have also tried the both the mango pop ice and frozen breath from a previous visit and both are items that you should try at least once. However I'm not entire sure I would get them again, namely the frozen breath, because it was purely based on the fact that is simply normal cheetos puffs in some liquid nitrogen. That being said, it was a fun and novel experience! The pop ice is more conflicting; I did like the abundance of fresh mango slices but the texture of the pop ice wasn't what I expected. It was rather hard and without flavor once you eat away at all the mango bits and syrup coated ice.",2017-09-12 00:07:31

Yes!! Woo Che is buffet style so you just go and get the types of meat you want instead of having to wait for someone to bring it to you; this guarantees maximum eating potential and doesn't leave much room for bad service. 

So as soon as I'm seated, I always head straight for the fridge to get the beef brisket and tongue. I eat these with my oil and salt mixture, sriracha, kim chi, and lettuce leaves. Then I load up on pork belly. This stuff is straight fat so it may not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you like bacon, this is the Korean version. Lastly is the galbi, which are marinated spare ribs that are sweet, savory, and kills the KBBQ craving. The sushi here is good for what it is and the fruit at the buffet is a sweet end to dinner. 

The service is always decent. They are very easy to find and are quick to change the grills once they get covered in marinade. They will also refill a buffet item if it's low and you bring it to their attention. I have eaten here with a lot of different people and everyone always leaves happy and full. This is the only KBBQ place I eat at in Las Vegas; you can't beat the price and quality.

I originally thought going in, that it would be very small portions, limited menu, and really expensive. However, this place impressed me astronomically. The appetizer we got (the warm goat cheese spread with corn chips) and the bread basket with all baked assortments was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the lamb chops and the veal, amazing. The sauce and aioli just make everything on all of Bobby Flays' dishes, and you can tell when you're eating, that he put a lot of his effort into what's on your plate in front of you. The veal was a 16oz veal, which we didn't even know you could get that big..and once again, amazing.
I believe each plate comes with a special tamale as the side dish, each one is different though. Although I'm not a big tamale fan, my boyfriend chowed his right down (so it must have been that good).
Overall, I was definitely impressed by the portions, much bigger than expected (we were most definitely full leaving dinner). Not as expensive as I would have guessed either, good surprise. Also, I believe the menu does change from time-to-time (as all big name chef restaurants do often) but not too often that you'd be upset that you couldn't get what you got last year. I was very satisfied with every aspect of the restaurant and our waiter was also very helpful, he explained all of our questions we had on the menu.

We've booked a table here on 2 previous occasions but were never able to make it all the way to liberty village due to change in plans. I almost got the feeling that somehow this place was tabooed for us until I stumbled upon the travelzoo deal. We had 1 appetizer, 2 mains and 2 limited selection beverages to choose from. For appetizer, we shared the mushroom crostini which came out pretty quickly. The flavors were there but the texture was off since the crostini was extremely soggy. For mains, we ordered the risotto and halibut. Unfortunately, the wait for these dishes was so long that we were frustrated by the time they arrived at our table. Only a couple of tables were occupied and I really cannot fathom what was going on inside the kitchen to justify the kind of delay we experienced. Even a big group of ladies next to our table complained to the server for the slow service. We skipped dessert since we thought we had stayed there way too long for our meal. The risotto had good flavor due to the asparagus but was a bit watered down. I wish they put more salsa verde on the halibut, it was too dry.

It was exactly as I expected it would be in terms of menu and ""decor"".  I was, however, impressed with the wide variety of options available on their menu.  Yes, they had the standard hot dog options, pizzas, subs and hoagies.  What was nice is that each different type of food was ordered and prepared in a separate area, so lines moved quickly.  We stuck with the hot dog section and each had a hot dog, got one order of fries and an order of chicken fingers.  When they tell you a small order of fries serves two, they aren't kidding.  The basket was overflowing with perfectly seasoned fries with just the right amount of crisp.  

I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the standard ""not sure what is actually in it"" hot dog taste to that of the all beef, high quality dogs.  Not a knock against the O, it just made me enjoy my fries and chicken fingers more than the hot dog itself.  I did, however, love the chicken fingers.  Great flavor, moist and just the right amount of breading.  The downside for this Buffalonian is that they do not have blue cheese, so I just dipped them in hot sauce instead.  

I had no idea that the O served alcohol, so it was a surprise to see not only a selection of tap beers, but also a cooler that wrapped around the restaurant with everything from Boones Farm to high end microbrews.

Of the many options for Five Guys in the area, this is the location that consistently pumps out exactly what I want. Don't get me wrong, in a crunch I'll visit the Epicenter or some other location, but this is the one that is my golden standard. This is why this Five Guys rocks it out:

- Never a line. I don't know how they do it, but of the many times I've been here, I have never stood in line (ok, maybe they are sometime finishing up with one person). Perhaps I just happen upon the place at off-peak times, but hey, that is my experience.

- Consistently well-prepared burgers. At various locations, I've noticed subtle differences in the preparation--either too greasy or not greasy enough, lacking in condiments, bun falling apart. Whenever I come here, I get perfect buns and fries with the right amount of condiments.

FOOD - They have a bunch of specials in the front chalkboard that's not on the menu, and is more unique!

+ Oreo explosion pancake $10 approx - This is a chalkboard special and it came with cookie dough ice cream and is pleasant on the eyes and yummy in your tummy! But I recommend splitting this with someone because it's quite heavy on the sweetness if you eat all those pancakes (props to you if you can finish all of this by yourself.....) The pancakes are also quite fluffy and seem homemade and has crushed oreos mixed in the batter!

+Florentine Benedict $13 approx - Comes with homefries and a bowl of fruit. Nothing outstanding, but good food.

+ Hot Chocolate $3 - This is one of the more pretty hot chocolates that I've seen, with generous amounts of whip cream and syrup on the top, served with a cookie. I don't recommend ordering this with a sweet breakfast like pancakes.. overload of sweetness.

Oh and free refills on coffee btw.",2014-10-13 23:53:56

This place has a good variety of selection too.

ZBrObtwlmboPPTh3x1qCig,PwVeEN9hEQN3qCpvhubk3Q,IZUDXIq5SULhQ5RGLCdB7g,3,0,0,0,"This is a small little Mexican food stop within the Scottsdale 101 complex that left me with mixed feelings.  I happened by this place on a weeknight at the invitation of one of my friends.  They offer tacos, burritos, and assorted other Mexican staples.

The service was quick and we were given our food shortly after ordering.  I ordered a taco meal combo and a burrito.  First issue was they got my order wrong on the burrito, giving me steak instead of the chicken I asked for.  Not a huge deal, but given that we were almost the only customers there, it was disappointing.  The taco meal was the best part of the experience.  They have a little buffet bar to add on additional salsa, cilantro, and other vegetables, which I took advantage of.  All in all it was tasty, however, the guacamole looked like it was made in a blender on liquify, and reminded me of the green slime I would see on Nickelodeon as a kid.  Not my favorite.  The rice and refried beans that accompanied the taco were pretty good though!

The burrito was more disheartening.  I'm not a big fan of steak in Mexican food.  I find it usually contains an inordinate amount of fat/gristle and this was no exception.  In addition it just did not taste that great and lacked flavor.  I would sooner pick up a burrito from Chipotle in the future.

Outside of the food, the restaurant itself is fine.  It was clean, however, it was pretty dead after 6:30.  We were the only ones there chatting for probably another hour after that.  Not a terrible experience, but I probably won't be back anytime soon.",2018-03-05 18:10:36
ytZ204zcwerfv7UBFHiZZQ,0-UxxxWLz1muOzPx2F3-kQ,ETTzxqOcPuxMqV37y1uhdg,4,0,0,0,"We tried the new location in Anthem this past Friday.  Friends of ours that live out there told us about it, and we were excited to give it a try.

We went somewhat early to avoid the crowds/rush, and left impressed and wanting to come back.

We arrived, and were greeted by one of the owners, explained we were first timers, she was very friendly and welcoming, and made us feel right at home.  The young Lady that took our order was also friendly, patient, and helped walk us through the process since it was our first time.  

We ordered a large house salad, a regular order of garlic knots, and a 20"" cheese pizza.  The salads are in a cooler by the drink station, and are already made.  Since it was our first time, the young Lady that took our order grabbed it and the dressing for us while we grabbed a table and got ourselves situated.  

I was a little concerned that the salad was pre-made and waiting in a cooler, but this was not a problem.  While fairly basic with a romaine mix, some green bell pepper, tomato, and some cucumber; everything was fresh, crisp, and cold.  We chose the balsamic vinaigrette, and were happy with our choice.  The dressing had that nice balsamic flavor, but it wasn't overwhelming.

Next up was the garlic knots, and they were very good.  We ordered a regular size, and receive 6 hot, fresh, chewy knots with a good amount of garlic.  They didn't last long, GRP serves them with a side of marinara for dipping, which I thought was a nice touch.  One word of warning, be careful opening the container of sauce, it is very hot (it was also very good, and went well with the knots).

Then came the ""pizza de resistance"" (sorry, couldn't help myself).  My favorite meals are usually simple, well prepared foods with quality ingredients.  This pizza fit that requirement nicely.  The pizza came out and it looked and smelled wonderful.  We all dug in and yes, it tasted as good as it looked and smelled!  The menu states that GRP uses ""whole milk Wisconsin mozzarella hand shredded each day for freshness""; one taste, and I believe it.  Fresh quality cheese stands out, and has a flavor/texture that ""pizza topping"" will never match.    The sauce was very low key, but was plentiful and complimented the cheese and crust nicely.  Oh, the crust...had the right amount of chewiness and the flavor that once again says quality ingredients matter.  The only negative about this pizza (in my very humble opinion) was that there was a little too much crust at the outside edge.  Luckily, the crust is light, tasty, and chewy the way it should be, so this doesn't really take anything away from a very good pizza.  The 3 of us devoured that 20' pizza, and only took home a little over 1/2 a slice!

We enjoyed our visit to the new GRP, and can't wait to return; as a matter of fact, my wife wanted to go there for Mother's Day, but they were closed for the holiday.  

4-4.5 stars.  Keep up the good work!",2017-05-15 19:59:04

If you like seafood, this is the place to be. Also, I expect you should visit before everyone starts to flood this place like every other brunch place in Madison. Don't you wish you had a quiet place to go to for brunch, with delicious delicious food?

Don't expect much service here. I tend to overlook it for the one and only place where you get seafood brunch! And good quality and delicious brunch indeed.

What do I like here?
Crabcake benedict - delicious real crab meat, not minced into tiny tiny bits. the hollandaise sauce is so good I can't get enough and need to ask for another tub of it...
Lobster mac and cheese - are you serious? Thank you for the entire lobster pincer and another half pincer. It is not chopped into tiny pieces, excuse me, it is an ENTIRE PIECE OF LOBSTER. the mac and cheese is delicious and not overly cheesy or creamy. If you had a small appetite like me, be prepared to bring home leftovers, which still taste really really good.

My chicken salad was huge and everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food.  Staff was very nice and our server was fairly attentive to the table.  After our meal we ventured into the beer cave.  I pieced together a 6pack of various craft brews (all which were $1 if you are packing them to go) to take home.  Plenty of great offerings in the beer cave..almost everyone of my favorites were available.

Bad:  The place was pretty busy and didn't seem well organized.  If you're waiting for a table there's not really any place to stand while you wait.  Our server was often distracted and stopped in the middle of our order to talk with another server.  The layout isn't the greatest and staff often walked by and knocked into my chair as I ate.  When I rang out (I don't think they take your bill up...ours was presented and our server never came back?) the girl at the front started to ring up another couple behind me before I grabbed my 6 pack off the counter.

Tried the Brown Bread today - yum! A scoop by itself would be perfect (but, of course I had to go and add hot fudge to it!). The BB flavor offered a nice balance of toffee coated bread crumb-like texture and creamy ice cream. It was quite sweet, but the bread helped to bring a little more balance to the sweet flavor. The hot fudge is house-made, which I always appreciate (typically the only time I order it). It was quite rich with a slight bitterness and a bit too sweet for my tastes.

We enjoy finding out-of-the-way, mom and pop places when eating out. Crazy Jim's has been around for over 30 years and is hidden in plain site on the southeast corner of 15th Avenue and Indian School. Note: It's easier to get to from 15th Avenue and parking is behind the buildings on the corner.

Crazy Jim's is not a huge place. But the staff was extremely friendly and we were seated right away in the front section where it is well lit. It may be tight, but it has a certain charm that makes you forget about the non-descript buildings in the area. And once the food arrives, you will forget you're in Phoenix.

We started our meal, as we typically do at a new restaurant, by sampling the appetizers. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus. My girlfriend added an order of Shrimp Scampi. Both are solid choices! The hummus was a generous portion and served with piping hot pita bread. And the scampi was simple and delicious. It was also served with fresh pita bread. Don't forget to soak up the scampi butter sauce with the pita bread!

I've enjoyed some good gyros around town. But the Steak and Feta Gyro I enjoyed today was better than anything I tasted at the last Greek-Fest I attended. The tender steak was cooked perfectly and it melted with the feta cheese, grilled onions and tzatziki sauce. Even though my family isn't Greek, the side of fries reminded me of the homemade fries my mother use to make. This leads me to believe that there is a lot of from-scratch cooking going on in Crazy Jim's tiny kitchen. And when have you ever held pita bread which was too hot to handle?

My girlfriend made a sensible choice by selecting from the very unique ""Not a Salad"" list. It's not a salad because it was made with cabbage. She really enjoyed the grilled chicken which was accompanied by the traditional Greek items (calamata olives, cheese, etc.). Oh, and another serving of their excellent pita bread!

In the end, we were stuffed and had a lot of left overs. Plus, we were very happy that we chose Crazy Jim's over a popular chain that isn't too far from here. We will definitely be back!",2016-10-03 07:28:02

The meat was dry, tough and chewy the taste it left in my mouth was that of burnt charcoal.  Wow so disappointed I was as the meat should have been the star of the meal. The saffron rice and the fresh taftoon persian bread was good however not enough to warrant a repeat visit.

My meal by itself cost $9 and change for a couple small bits of meat, rice, homemade taftoon persian bread, veggies and a bitter tomato.

-  That a major hotel still charges for Internet access in this day and age is ridiculous, especially considering how it's typically part of the basic package for other hotels.  In the case of Westin, they charge $13/day!  But they offer a bargain price of $39 for three days.  Yes, folks, for the price of a month's worth of cable access at home you can get three days at the Westin.
-  Urban Farmer, the restaurant that is house in the hotel, is fine but with really ridiculous prices.  Their mission statement, posted on one of their walls, claims (in part) ""respect for midwestern food traditions"".

Trinity Bellwoods is a reasonably sized park in more-or-less downtown Toronto sandwiched between two major thoroughfares of the city - Dundas and Queen st. west, making it very convenient and easily accessible. 

On countless occasions I've had a picnic here with my partner/friends while having lovely conversations with other picnickers, hipsters, dog owners, homeless people (I realize my categorization is not exclusive) and others. On a sunny day when folks spread out a blanket and spread out over it, they are generally happy, a feeling that is easily rubbed off on others, especially when some alcohol is involved; a behaviour that, I declare publicly, I do not condone.

At other times the park has lots to offer for people watching, from sweaty tennis players to a group of old grandfathers sharing a joke. The idea of owning a dog (pet) scares me and therefore I am content at watching other people's dogs chasing frisbee and sniffing fellow canines in the off-leash area of the park.

Enjoy your visit!

The pool area is nice.  They have very comfortable lounge chairs and it's quiet.  You would never know that you are so close to downtown.  I considered giving it four stars because  the rooms themselves (although plenty large with nice patios) are pretty plain.  But the general manager is friendly and says that they are still updating the property.  The bathrooms were beautiful and had great products, but I didn't get a chance to check out their spa.

Sandwiches were served up quickly.  Loved the crispy kettle chips and the salad sides.  The BBLT was pretty awesome.  The beef bacon tasted more like beef jerky which was fine by me - salty and chewy!  A nice twist on the BLT.

Service was friendly and restaurant was baby friendly (although no change table in the bathroom which resulted in me changing my little one on a chair in front of the big glass window facing Bloor St. West for all to see - she has no shame).

Not only is Pamela knowledgable, but she is one of the sweetest people I've ever had beautify my nails.  I found her through Unlokt (a super cool website to find all the fab spots in the city).  One thing I really loved about working with Pamela is that she really tried to fit me into her schedule.  I explained to her that it was going to be my birthday, and I really wanted to get my nails done for my special day.  She was pretty much booked, and she could not do it on the specific day that I had wanted. However, she was so helpful, she was able to fit me in a few days before my birthday, on a Friday at 8:45am.  She texts, which is awesome for keeping in touch with scheduling!  We were both having a bit of a hurried morning, with phone call interruptions here and there, but she was able to come up with a pretty design that I never would have thought of.  

It costs $41 for a gel manicure, no extra fees/charges for designs, and she will literally sit through each nail design with you until its perfect!

The industrial interior has been designed with props, posters, and artwork from the '80s and '90s.

There were few menu items, serving only beef and pork and concentrating on the quality of the ingredients. 

The best part is they actually cook for you and the servers alternate if your original server is busy with something else. No need to worry about getting them burnt the servers will save you the trouble!

Amgus short rib meat was so juicy and tender.  Also the marinated skirt steak was tender and sweet.

The tables have electronic buttons built in so if you need service or want the check, just touch the button.

Fortunately, my family has stayed in the area, and I have a reason to come back and enjoy the unique goodness that is Swensons.

First, you need to understand that Swensons (there are seven locations) is an old-time drive-in restaurant - think Sonic, but older and only available in Northeast Ohio.

You drive up and turn on your lights.  A car-hop comes RUNNING out to your car.  When I was a kid, the car-hops were mostly University of Akron students, earning extra money for college through tips.  They make everything to order - so after you order, sit back and relax.  It WILL be worth it!

I don't know how well I can review the whole menu because I don't think I've varied my choice in the 38 years I have been going here.  The menu is varied - it's not just burgers and fries.  My wife swears that the jalapenos potato teasers are the best she's ever had.  My goto has always been a bacon double cheeseburg plain.  Note that they are called ""burg's"" not burgers.  I also get a side of fried mushrooms and a large California.  A ""California"" is something like a limeade with grape flavoring.  They also have a ""Florida"" which is limeade with orange in it (although I've never had one).

I've been here 3 times... going back tomorrow for the 4th time for my BF's birthday. The first time we came here was for my birthday in October. Then two other times, we took visitors here for happy hour.

First visit: ordered gnocchi (as everyone else has recommended), chicken sambolita, risotto balls, risotto, lemon polenta cake. The risotto that I ordered for my entree was too salty, and probably needed more cream. I really liked the lemon polenta cake, and that gelato that they added on top of it; the gelato really made things interesting, cool, and added a kick to the bite of sweet polenta. I don't usually like things too sweet or rich, so the polenta cake just hit the mark for dessert. BF did not enjoy it as much, but he likes richer desserts (think cheesecake and creme brule). Risotto balls were decent, but nothing to rave about. Now, despite this all, what makes this restaurant 5 stars in my book is the chicken sambolita and the gnocchi. BF and I are not usually big fans of eating chunks of dough, which is what gnocchi at other restaurants (like Sokolowski's University Inn's gnocchi tastes like to me). Gnocchi at Chinato is like eating a creamy succulent ball of heaven. Each bite just gets better. My third visit, I ordered the gnocchi again, and tasted even better than I had imagined. 

The chicken.. let me rave about the chicken. I am a true believer in never ordering chicken at restaurants, just because no restaurants ever does chicken right for me. Either bland or dry. Chinato is the first restaurant I have been to that makes chicken perfect. Juicy, tender, crispy skin on the outside.. there's not a bit of dryness to this, and every bite has deeply seeped flavor to it. Sadly, my bf ordered this, so I wasn't able to hoard all the chicken to myself. Definitely will be ordering this for my main entree this Friday. 

Second and third visits, we always made sure to order gnocchi during happy hour. The other sandwiches on the happy hour list, and drinks were decent, but nothing worth raving about. I tried the crudo sampler for my first happy hour; small bites of fish with other stuff, but nothing memorable. Regardless, I still maintain the 5 start review for Chinato just because the gnocchi and chicken that I ordered first time around were to die for. 

I have been to all 4 of Zach Bruell's restaurants... Chinato is my favorite hands down, and ranked in my top two restaurants for all time, ranked close to Chicago's Perennial's.",2012-05-04 01:56:55

First impression: LOVE the open space. LOVE the decor and LOVE the chalkboard menu. It's awesome. I even enjoyed waiting in line because, it was totally going to be worth it - so far everything was fabulous and so the food must be also.

Got a bit of Spanish & salmon salad and butter chicken - the salad seemed to have all the things I love; salmon, nuts, spinach in light dressing - and well, can't go wrong with butter chicken really, can you?

Apparently, you can.
I think this is where I need to say that I am a food lover- the sight of it makes my mouth water 95% of the time and you've really got to have not tried for that to not happen. This was one of those times.

The chicken - was not quite buttery and had more curry flavour than anything else. I only had a few pieces of chicken and it really was a soupy kind, not the stew kind.  it came with what I heard was Basmati rice - that was just dry - I believe Uncle Ben's basmati rice was better than this.

Apparently I don't like spinach and smoked salmon together either - even though I love both dearly.
My friend's meatloaf was absolutely wonderful -but the mash potato and house salad was not.
Overall, the bland food left lot to be desired - apparently they're not a big believer of seasoning. I have no idea what inspired me to pay $20 for blandness...but there you have it.

It's a chic little spot and I imagine fabulous place for coffee/tea with cookies or something - but if you're looking for a place to have a nice  sit down meal during lunch or dinner or whatever - there are much better options just steps away.",2011-06-04 22:28:40

The ambience is fantastic and for being the second night the service was flawless. 

We had several types of margaritas. I really liked the frozen passion fruit but if you like cachaca try the pineapple Batida. The custom guacamole is an awesome concept and adding that perfectly cooked bacon along with mango and pineapple was mind altering. The chips were hot and salty and perfect. 

Next came the wings... In a fish sauce caramel. OMG. They're everything I could ever ask for and reminded me of the first fish sauce wings I had at PokPok. All of the tacos were delicious but perhaps a little spicy for the average palate. I like spicy, so a lot of them ended up on my plate.

Walked in toward the end of lunch for a takeout order. I went with their daily special, the Baja Chicken sandwich- chicken with olives and onions and a chipotle sauce and two kinds of cheese, with tomatoes, and lettuce. Each sandwich comes with a side, (potato or pasta salad, chips or fruit)- I chose the pasta salad. I also added the Chai This blended drink- chai, banana, protein powder, and soy milk.

Service was friendly though they nearly mixed my order up with a group order.  Dining room with the barista is surrounded by windows and has almost an old school diner feel to it- but there is far more space in the other adjacent dining room than I expected. Larger than it appears on the outside.

Got home with my meal- sipped the chai drink as I drove and it was delicious! A bit steep at over $6 for a 24 ounce cup, but it was tasty. Sandwich was $8.50 including the pasta, and the sandwich itself was enormous! I only ate half and gave the other piece to my BF, along with the pickle. Pasta salad was also a decent portion, served in a lidded Styrofoam cup to keep it cold and prevent spills. Also fresh and flavorful, with bits of tomato and a creamy white sauce similar to salad dressing.

Delicious sandwich, good portions, lots of variety on menu- will come back to try another sandwich, or perhaps a soup. Today they were out of cream of mushroom, but let me know it usually sells out fast.",2014-06-12 17:07:11

It is so important. All the vegetables are colorful. They are all flavorful. Now, what tastes good to me and what you like are different. So I hate to say you will love this dish.... . Believe me when I say I have never had a bad dish! Every item is TAY-STEE. Thai for yummy!! 
 You have the option of adding meats to your dish. They are all fine but do avoid adding beef. It is NOT GOOD. The only dish you should have beef in is the only dish on the menu designed for it. Beef Satay in Peanut sauce. TIP#1 If you love HOT food order your dish Thai Hot Plus! TIP#2 If the hot food is too much; order Thai Iced Tea to quell the burn. The Thai Iced Tea is  the best in AZ.

I personally thought it was a great combo even with the cashier's warning that wasn't a very popular duo. The egg was cooked nicely as over easy, even though I saw some pics on Yelp with an overcooked and unappetizing egg. So the burger was great and filling. I upgraded to the onion rings and I shouldn't have. The wife got the regular burger and fries, and I ended up eating more of her fries than the rings. There was too much batter and it ended up ruining the onion.

However, I did ask what type of oil they use to fry their items due to a nut/soy allergy, and they indicated using a blend of canola and rice bran oil. After a quick google search on rice bran oil, I found out it's good quality oil with some health benefits. So if I'm going to eat fried food, might as well eat some healthier cooking oil. The interior and atmosphere is nothing special as it's more of a fast casual spot. Glad I tried it and would recommend it, but only warrants an occasional return for me.",2017-01-30 02:23:51

The food is okay (at best), the prices are on the higher side and the service is not what you would expect for a restaurant in this area.
I've been here a few times and typically order vegetarian entrees (enchiladas, quasedillas, salads). My husband tends to order beef or pork dishes. Each time we've come we've had leftovers that go bad in the fridge because we're just not interested in them. That is a really bad sign in our house.
The last time we came here the service was mediocre. The wait staff was nice (when we saw them), but I basically had to shout someone down for water after getting zero refills in the 15 minutes my glass was empty and sitting at the end of the table. It really wasn't that busy, so I wonder if they are just that under-staffed.

It was very surprising considering the reputation of Ocean Prime. The server assistant just kept walking back and forth not pouring our sparkling water. We had to do it ourselves. Our appetizers came at different times because the server didn't understand we wanted two orders of the oysters. Our champagne took a long time. And at one point a man in a suit came by and asked if everything was good? We answered and he walked away. Who was he? A manager? The owner? Some drunk customer?  We don't know. The server responded to our questions with ""I don't know"", ""Let me check"",  ""I suppose"". And her hair was very messy. It was a pony tail with the sides down. All of it should be pulled back.

A sign on the street outside helped us know we were in the right place, and then a short walk down a hallway filled w/art and we came to the door for the meadery.  Once inside, it was a tasteful relaxed place. 

There were twelve meads available and you could order flights of four meads each.  So we ordered three flights so that we could sample them all.  The 'bartender' was friendly and when we had questions the owner actually came out to talk to us more about the history, process, and business.  That was extremely interesting and we all enjoyed that.  I do wish they had food options.  Just cold plates like charcuterie platters or vegetables and hummus trays would make socializing here more enticing.

As far as the meads go, it may be an acquired taste.  Most of them I just didn't really care for.  There were a few I didn't mind drinking.  The Hammer Smashed Cherry, The Forest of Equilibrium, the Wildflower Mead, and the Hibiscus Flowers and Ginger were the ones I would drink again.  I think I expected more of a honey flavor and it's not really there.

I did enjoy the space and trying the meads.  I loved the service and I really like the idea of a meadery. I'm giving it an extra star becuase I like that it is unique and the service was awesome.

AYCE Chicago style pizza in Champaign, I couldn't pass up the chance to eat the pizza lunch buffet during the weekday. I quickly hopped into my car and jetted to this location for my lunch hour. I was surprised to find that there was plenty of seating in the restaurant. Staff was super friendly and I was off to the races to eat pizza. Now the ""Rush Street"" pizza bar is 8.49 Monday to Friday 11AM to 1:30 PM. They give you a choice of salad or the two soups (tomato bliss or chicken green chili soup). I was took the tomato bliss, very rich tomato soup. I wish they had some cheese to go with it. I proceeded to gorge on the pizza selection and the calzone. My impression is that they don't have any deep dish pizzas which is unfortunate when you think chicago style pizza the deep dish is the cornerstone. Lots of other pizza selection from meat lover to veggies to hawaian. The calzones were prepared well. The pizza is super hot so let it cool down just a little bit before diving in. Overall the pizza is comparable to other restaurant quality pizza and a bit better than the chains (papa johns and pizza hut). They are not kidding when they tell you that this is for the rush hour lunch crowd. Before I finished my soup, the check was on the table in case I had to pay and run. Service was friendly. Also and FYI you can request pizza for the buffet. So all and all the pizza is relatively good quality, but missing a deep dish would have pushed it over the top. Finally the chocolate chip cookie is a bit too small and just a odd way to end the meal. You get just a small one...

Pro: AYCE lunch pizza buffet, better than papa john or pizza hut, super fast service

Cons: No deep dish pizza, if it is not busy you may have a very limited selection. There was 4 pizza types and the calzones and breadsticks

Upon being seated, we were greeted by the manager with two glasses of champaign (on the house) to welcome us on our anniversary. The two servers who were taking care of us were extremely knowledgeable and detailed in their reviews and explanations of menu items. (William, you're awesome). 

Appetizers: Thai Peanut Calamari & Low Country Crab Dip - The Calamari was cut into large 'steaks', unlike most places with traditional rings. These were very meaty, cooked to perfection, and the thai peanut sauce blended perfectly with the slight tang of the wasabi aioli. The crab dip was probably the best I've had at a restaurant - full of large lump pieces of crab and covered in cheese. A stand out dish for sure.

Salad: G's House - The goat cheese was paired well with the house made balsamic vinaigrette in this. I'm usually not a big goat cheese fan, but this salad really worked. 

Entrees: 9oz Filet Mignon & Just for the Halibut - the filet was cooked exactly as ordered, and covered in a delicious mushroom demi glaze. The mashed potatoes had a delicious flavor that was perfect with the demi. While a filet is always good, it really couldn't stand up against how phenomenal the Halibut dish was. There were so many distinct flavors that all paired perfectly together. The sun dried tomato sauce was amazing with the chive potato cake, as well as with one big bite of halibut & crab. It'll be hard to order anything different next time I go, that's how good it is. 

Dessert: Mom's Carrot Cake & Mom's Apple Cake - The apple cake was good, if not a little bit too try in my opinion. I wouldn't be in a rush to order again. I know many other reviews rave about it, so I may have had a one-off experience with it. Mom's Carrot Cake, however, was incredible. Moist & covered in a cream cheese frosting, exactly the way it should be. 

TL;DR: Get the calamari appetizer & the Just for the Halibut entree. You literally cannot go wrong here.",2016-09-08 02:10:13

7gcie1lCTd7t1aBqurQWOg,ps0Y_WkkywSIQAzTszzGOQ,V19SJT2zo8ydJWhMB_31SA,2,0,0,0,I've been on a Mediterranean kick for the past week and my friend came here and said it was good. Took the boyfriend here and he was excited saying he used to eat this all the time back home. I don't know if it was because it was late or what but the food was underwhelming. I got the chargrilled lamb with basmati rice and salad. The lamb was super dry and had no seasoning whatsoever. There wasn't much rice on my plate but what I tried was fine but needed more salt. The salad which was most of the plate was alright but I've had better Greek dressing that tastes better or even has some taste. My boyfriend got the lamb gyro and said the same about the dryness and flavorless lamb. He said it was really tough and chewy. The service was excellent though.,2016-08-14 19:49:34

Went and got seated promptly with a reservation and the server, Juan was friendly and engaging.  The service was not the most attentive, but it was not bad at all.  The bread with burrata was tasty, nd the meatballs were very good.  Fresh tasting and clearly not frozen.  They were a decent size and came with two good hunks of bread (lot of bread at this meal).  The pastas were good as well.  The cavatelli was delicious although it was not very large at all.  My colleague had the rigatoni, which was about 50-75% more food than my plate, which was odd.  

The positives were that the food was good, the pasta was excellent and we were seated promptly with pretty good service.

The negatives were that this place is LOUD....and I mean LOUD LOUD LOUD.  We spent the entire night engaged in a light shout to talk to each other, and I am not kidding.  By the end, I had a headache and a sore throat.  Clearly there is only so much to be done with the acoustics in this place, but maybe changing the glass front to allow open windows or something, because the noise alone would dissuade me from returning.  Second, the disparity between portion size was really odd and significant.  I mean, really, the rigatoni was almost double the food from the cavatelli.  Third, the prices are steep.  I mean, yes, it is hand made and everything is very good and clearly attention is paid to it, and that has value.  However, a bowl of pasta should not be 21 dollars...certainly not for the size they give you.  At the end of the day, pasta is still just flour and water.  The price for 1 beer, 3 pasta dishes, 2 desserts, meatballs and bread with burrata was 107 I think (100 and something).  A little steep honestly.  Lastly, the panna cotta dessert just was not impressive.  A real mishmash of flavors, that did not really work that well together, with some over pronounced and others barely noticeable, and it was a cream rather than a firmer panna cotta.

Overall, the place serves pretty good food, and if you don't mind the hectic disorganized nature, the insanely loud environment, the slightly steep prices and the heavy plaid/neck beard hipster crowd, then it is a solid choice for pasta.  I would give it 3.5* overall, but since the food it legitimately well executed for the most part, I will round up.  Kudos again to the owner for reaching out after my first terribly abortive attempt to eat there and even offering to buy me a meal to try them out (which I declined).  Still a great gesture though.",2018-05-09 15:33:44

Excellent service. Feel like family while dining. Unpretentious. Owners are a delight. It's a neighborhood secret. An absolute delight. One that shows its value and quality by withstanding the test of time. 

I am obsessed with their Parmesan style dishes and tortellini. I have trouble deciding between the Chicken Parmesan and Eggplant Parmesan. Not a lot of places do Eggplant right, so when you do find it house made done correctly it's a must.  
And then there is the Tortellini in the red pepper sauce. Oh. My. Goodness. Wow. I could drink the sauce. If they served it up in a wine glass, I'd shamelessly indulge. It's THAT good. 

Friends and family have said their rack of lamb and half rack are a must order. (I'm not a lamb eater) 

I can say that I don't even like Chicken Masala but I do like theirs. That's saying something!

I am trying to make it a point of going often in order to make the most of my membership purchase. (Though, I suppose supporting the gallery is worthwhile in and of itself.) The gallery is big enough it will probably take several trips to figure out where everything is, and see everything worth seeing.

The AGO renovation is amazing, and seems like what the ROM renovation should have aspired to. I like the Crystal, but once inside the museum it seems clear that it doesn't work that well. Gallery space is poorly utilized, and the interior just doesn't look that nice. There is all sorts of infrastructure jutting out here and there, which ruin the the interior elements of the design. The AGO on the other hand seems like a perfectly executed renovation. The exterior is certainly nice, but the interior is where things really shine. Everything seems neat and tidy and just right. The ROM's big success is moving its entrance to Bloor, and the new lobby which is quite stunning. Beyond that I think the renovation wasn't a success. It certainly doesn't seem to have captivated Torontonians the way the AGO renovation has.

The menu is fairly traditional in terms of American-Chinese cuisine. Everything you're probably familiar with is found here. I decided to try their orange chicken while my girlfriend opted for the chicken lo mein. Combination plates come with an eggroll and fried rice, but you can modify and add noodles as an alternative if you wish to do so.

For 7.95 per combination plate, the portions are generous and the quality of what you get is far better than what you'd typically find for North Phoenix. Takeout is common, but we chose to dine-in. 

Chinese has always been a bit of a risk for us, with many places just barely being able to pass as acceptable. Fortunately, that's definitely not the case here. I look forward to going back and experimenting with some of their other offerings.

Highly recommended for some cheap eating Chinese!",2018-04-16 14:27:25

I was recently reminded that it's a place we should visit again.  We've now been back 3 times in the past few weeks, and I'm happy to report that Pizza Pit rates a SOLID 5 stars on the Brak-o-Meter.  How so? It's not a chain, it's a family-run joint, and looks and feels like it.  Lots of good TV's for catching whatever ballgame you're interested in watching.  A unique style of pizza, named after Fred Garvin's stomping grounds, the quad cities area, located at the Iowa/Illinois boundary.  It's a slightly thick crust with a unique texture that is difficult for me to describe, but I like it a lot.  The toppings are placed under the cheese, and the pizza is strip-cut rather than pie-cut (though I'm sure they'd oblige a pie-cut request).  Salads are bueno too, and there are sandwiches and stuff I haven't tried but I'm sure are good.. I just go straight for the pizza & a small salad and I'm one happy creature.

Now I'm not Vietnamese or even close to it but I thought this was a good or better than anywhere else I've had pho. This place is in a shopping center area and is on the second level so you need to climb a few stairs or use the elevator. Service was very good and the prices very reasonable. I started with the spring rolls with shrimp that came with this spicy peanut sauce that will make your bollocks tingle. In fact I saved the remainder of the sauce to use on everything else they brought me. Also had the green papaya salad which was unreal good. Slightly tart, citrus and spicy at the same time crunchy. Then had the chicken wings which were like little baby wings crispy fried with a spicy sauce to dip them in. Very, very good. Finished with the medium size pho bowl of the house special with beef, meatballs, tripe and whatever else they put in there along with those thin noodles and fresh basil and bean sprouts to add yourself plus chillies. The broth was flavorful but neutral mild so you could add what you wanted. I hit it with sriracha and some of the left over peanut sauce and wow, so many flavor levels it was like getting a lap dance on my tongue. Overall loved this joint.

I've lived in Lakewood for several years now and always tell myself I'm never going back to Marc's anytime I step in there. I normally like Marc's but the Lakewood location is godawful. 
First off the parking lot here is A NIGHTMARE! I can't tell you how many times I've almost got hit in the lot. There's several blind spots when turning out of aisles. 
The aisles in this store are very narrow, the store itself is grungy, and the only staff is either 15 or 115 so take your pick. 
They do NOT take cards except for Discover so prepare to wait behind grandma writing out a check, counting out pennies, or making a trip over to the atm. I believe this is one of the reason check out here is extremely slow. There aren't any belts to load your food on but there's a tiny counter top that can only fit about 2 gallons of milk and a bag of potatoes so you can't load any of your groceries to be rang out until the person in front of you is done. I also suggest to bring your own bags. The bags here are as thin as tissue paper.
Most of the time I've came in here was to grab 1 item and end up getting frustrated trying to find it or loose my patience in line and end up leaving. I can only compare this store to the steel yard wal-mart. If you are from this area you will understand the comparison.
I recommend NOT coming here after 4pm or around the 1st of the month. You will regret it!",2016-09-07 18:37:11

I live in Ahwatukee, but have been getting horrible service from all of the regular places in the 'tuk' so I made the dreaded cross over the I-10 to Chandler.  I was pleasantly surprised!  

It was a last minute decision so I called from the car to see what the wait time was - they said they could take me as soon as I got there.  When I arrived, I noticed how busy it was and expected to have to sit and wait that standard ""10-15"" minutes...  Not so!  I was immediately taken back for my services.

The tech working on me was very good - a little more quiet than the rest of the staff - but very friendly.  I noticed that everyone was wearing a white shirt - assumed it was the 'uniform'.  Also noticed that all of these ladies had on designer jeans and shoes - they must do quite well here.

My pedicure was awesome as was the manicure.  This is a really cute and clean place - the nail bar is fun to sit at.  They have TONS of gel/shellacs to choose from, not just a few colors of one line.  They all seemed quite knowledgeable.   I was getting a standard French manicure but the girl next to me was getting color and having a hard time choosing.  Her Tech was very patient and professional with her.  Everyone here is super nice.

I also noticed that her brows looked great and asked if she'd had them waxed there.  She said yes and that she always does a great job.  I'll have to try it next time.

I can't wait to see how long the manicure lasts.  I've had some other chip within days (even though the gels are NOT supposed to).

Yelp helped us identify the spot, and had it not been for the decently high rating I would've overlooked the place as a fast food spot. The location is right across from the TIFF Lightbox, and is set up very much like a grab and go fast food place. There were only a few tables and some bar stools, a very simple layout with open space probably meant for lineups or crowds waiting for their orders. We weren't sure if we had to order and then sit, but staff greeted us and directed us to a table for dine-in service. We were handed some menus - their takeout brochure really, and brought some chopsticks and napkins. Overall the place is cute and great for customization - a quick fix for food any meal of the day but not somewhere I'd rave about.

The menu is pretty simple and clearly designed for takeout. There's a variety of simple appetizers from miso soup to chicken karaage, a selection of bento boxes, specialty rolls, sashimi platters, set meals and combos, and the signature make your own maki roll. We went with a bento box each, chicken karaage to start, and a custom maki roll to share.

The bento box comes with miso soup, 4 pieces of California roll, choice of two gyoza or spring rolls, seaweed salad, and rice with choice of salmon, beef, pork, or veggie. It's quite a portion and definitely sufficient for a dinner meal, and quite affordable at $12.95. We noticed that everything is served in takeout-ready containers, and all the cutlery was disposable. I guess if you have leftovers of change your mind about staying, it's a quick ordeal having to only ask for some lids and bags. All the food comes at once, so chicken karaage showed up shortly after the bento boxes, and our custom roll followed. Our two-person small table barely fit all the items and the takeout trays made it feel a bit like a live Tetris game. 

The bento box items were generic but not disappointing, the salmon on my rice was tasty and not too salty or too flavoured. My gyoza were crunchy but still biteable and chewable, and were still hot inside. The miso soup was a bit bland, and the takeout container made it appear even more plain. Everything else was acceptable, no surprises good or bad.

The chicken karaage was not to our taste because there was a lot of fat and soft bones, and the pieces were rather irregularly sized. The batter/breading was crunchy but not flavourful. The chicken inside was quite dry as well. I won't be ordering this again!",2016-07-25 21:09:23

Dessert: 

Lemon Sorbet was wasn't pleasant to eat at all. I felt like we were eating bitter slushy that wasn't even slushy but icy.

I ordered the sopapilla with carne asada, which comes with refried beans, lettuce, tomato, and cheese on top of the frybread. Personally for me the bean made it a little to heavy for me even though the sopapilla itself was phenomenal. Next time, I will probably replace the beans with gaucamole instead and ask for extra lettuce for a more fresh and crunch aspect that I want. The salsas that come out in the bottle are really good. My favorite was the spiciest salsa that they have. It had really good flavor. I was a little disappointed because I was hoping it was going to be really hot but it was a little more on the mellow side.

Though it looks small, and carries a heavier price tag than I was anticipating ($13), it was worth every penny and a maybe even a few extra nickels. The eggs were perfectly soft-poached (a lost art), the cod cakes incredibly smooth and flavourful and the herb hollandaise was worth the order alone.

The minute I see that little postcard telling me that I need to get a smog check and spend my day at the DMV, just ruins my day. Ugh.

It just so happened that in the same stack of mail, I also saw a mailer for Express Smog. The special rate was $16.99 versus the original price of $19.99. I decided to wake up early on Saturday. Well after a relaxing breakfast and doing some laundry, getting an early start at the smog place turned into noon. Doh!

I arrived at Express Smog (located in front of Qdoba in the Walmart shopping center) and saw a line about three cars deep. I waited patiently in the AC of my car until they were ready for me to pull up. They took my DMV paperwork and my coupon. My car was done in under 10 minutes! Afterwards, he handed me the paperwork and I was on my way. The guy working there overheard that I was heading over to the DMV to get my tags and said that he could do the registration for me for $10. I started thinking about how difficult it is to find parking at the Stephanie DMV and decided to just do it here for $10 to save my sanity. Literally two minutes later, he gave me all of my receipts and told me that my sticker should be in the mail. Yay! I usually stand in line waiting at AAA for my registration longer than I did here at Express Smog.

I visited Japan last year and I only allowed myself to eat ""truly Japanese"" food.  My absolute favorite was Japanese curry, and I fell in love.
But alas, this was a love that could not last, as I had to return to Canada.
So when a friend of mine told me they found Japanese curry at Redheads, I had to try it!
It did not disappoint! It was perfect - if I closed my eyes I could swear I was sitting in Shibuya.
Rich, hot, not too spicy, very flavorful - Japanese curry is a distinct flavor.
Get the Katsu Japa Curry - Tonkatsu is a tender pork cutlet breaded with panko and fried golden brown, and it swims with agility in the golden curry sauce.
This place is licenced, too, so grab yourself an Asahi to go with your curry.

Since I am alumni, how could I not support a business giving back to my Alma mater especially since Cane's is from the south with not particular connection to the university other than being located across the street. They also give free kids meals to crowd members who watched a mountain west basketball or football game, just as long as the rebels WON. Just make sure to save your ticket from the game.  When this location first opened I did not understand the hype and actually thought they were pricey. Gave Canes a second chance and now I love it.  The batter is not too thick like most chicken finger places and you could tell these are freshly made and not frozen. Just like everyone else I too like the Texas toast because its soft and buttery.

I already have access to a beautiful free gym at work, but I kinda wanted something extra.
I had a couple friends as former members of TruFusion, and they raved about it, plus it's super close to my house, so I put it on my list of ""potentials."" The facility is really beautiful and ""spa-y"" with nice bathrooms and showers with shampoo and soap in them (+1 in my book). The price is reasonable at $70/month if you autopay 2 months in advance. Which is kinda a sneaky way to get your money, even after you decide you want to leave, but whatever. The instructors and front desk staff have all been super friendly and I've enjoyed the variety of classes I've attended so far.
The real reasons I like it are the variety of classes: bootcamp, pilates, kettlebell, battleropes, and of course yoga. Doing your activity in a hot room doesn't actually burn any more calories, so I'm not really ""into"" that, but whatever. (Toxins! say the yoga people). Other places in the neighborhood offer only yoga or only bootcamp style, etc. The other really great thing that sets trufusion apart is the schedule. There are 4 different rooms and they each have a class going pretty much all day. Like 6am-10pm. Other gyms/studios had limited schedules, to where I would be left with only one choice per day outside of my work hours.
Overall, I like TruFusion. It can't be my everything gym because it doesn't have treadmills/running tracks/weights, but it's a nice addition to my fitness regime. There are multiple classes to interest me, within my schedule constraints, every day. Because of the price, I won't be a member forever, but it's worth it to jumpstart my motivation for a little while.",2015-09-10 18:09:59

There's a reason they call it happy hour, because it truly is the happiest hour of them all especially at Geisha. The music is rocking, the ambiance is cool, and the drinks are free flowing...err...maybe not free but half off is a pretty good deal!

The service is so-so, especially during dinner.  Food comes 10-20 minutes after ordering which isn't bad, but the staff messes up an order at least once every time I come here.  I recommend coming right when lunch starts; you will have amazing service.  

The atmosphere is nice, but as with all AYCE establishments, it can get very loud and is often full.  Again, coming during early lunch/dinner is what's best.

Visited with some of my favorite dudes and tried a handful of stuff on the menu. Overall consensus was that the slow-cooked pork belly is a standout but most other dishes were on the salty side- maybe this effect is lessened when there is more drinking involved.

The beer cheese app (featuring pretzel rolls from Great Buns bakery) was accented with flaked sea salt that it really didn't need. The roux-based sauce was decently smooth though. The classic poutine arrived to the table slightly cold and with an egg verging on over-hard rather than runny, but the portion size was large and the fries are made from fresh-cut potatoes which always makes them tastier. Needed more cheese curds! The sandwiches seemed to fare a bit better, with the pork belly bahn mi being thick and savory while the fried chicken sandwich (warned as being spicy) was also notably salty. Opting for a side salad over the fries might be a better option if sodium intake is an issue.

Though I don't drink, I'm told the beer list is pretty interesting. There's seating at four-tops, high-tops, and the bar, as well as a small (currently unused) patio space. So far, no word on a happy hour or any brunch offerings, but those will likely come in time.

We had guacamole to start, which was ... sadly below average. Nothing was wrong with it, but there was nothing interesting or remarkable. Honestly, the guac you can buy at any grocery store (or hey, a building over at Drug Mart) in a tub that's mass produced is actually better. That makes me a little sad. If a place is tex mex style, shouldn't the guac be at least decent? Enough about my guac meh-ness. I had a burrito, which was similarly slightly below average. Again, nothing wrong with it. The weird thing was it was a little cold, like it'd been sitting. My dining partner's meal was warm, so who knows. 

I feel like it's difficult to get a new restaurant to succeed in this space. It's set back from the road a little in a plaza, and there are significantly better restaurants all around. Hell, there's a Chipotle in the same plaza where you can get a better burrito for a few bucks less.

The way he described one of the drinks when we sat down was so enticing, both my friend and I were immediately sold on it. As well as the second drink, even though it wasn't as delicious (but still tasty!) as the first. While the margaritas in other places in town may be bigger, Añejo scored points for quality.

But then as the night went on, he started to disappear more frequently and by the time our meal was over, might as well have changed in to a red and white sweater and called himself Waldo. We were constantly scanning the restaurant for him. I was on the fence about ordering the Strawberry Rhubarb margarita for dessert (since none of the desserts at Añejo are vegan, which, no surprise there... but if you're going to tell people on your menu to ask for the vegan options, actually having options would be nice), but since he took so long to come back; my food had settled and I no longer wanted it. 

Also, when he brought out our chips and salsa, he also brought out the 3 salsas that are meant for the tacos. Neither of us realized this initially, and just assumed he'd bring out more salsa for the tacos. But nope, that was it. Not a terrible thing, it just made the main course of the evening kind of bland and dry, and since he kept disappearing; we couldn't ask for more. As for the tacos themselves, since I wrote my last review, they've changed the veggie tacos to black bean. Instead of fried strips of tofu, you now get raw black beans. They're not bad, would be great if they had both tofu and black beans, and the black beans had a bit more flavor to them, but they're okay. I'd get them again. The corn tortillas seemed a little undercooked, but I'm glad they're available.

So... again, on the fence. This was really more of a 3.5 star visit, would've been 2.5 if the other staff weren't so awesome and kind of made up for our friendly, yet absent-minded Where's Waldo. Drinks were great, salsa is delicious, though not spicy (in terms of heat) at all. Probably need a third visit to seal things for myself :).",2013-09-06 16:43:29

They have really good deals i have got the salad and soup as a pick two and today i tried their turkey bacon avocado with the salad. I've only tried the fuji salad. Omg it's freaking AMAZING! It comes with ( i forgot what kind of cheese ) but i usually wouldn't eat that cheese but on this salad it was soooooo good!!! I always get that extra Fuji sauce. I jut had it a few hours ago and I'm already craving it. It's a nice place to sit relax and catch up on work as well. Not too loud. Not too crowded. It was perfect.

Last week when I went in there was no honey walnut shrimp around 6pm, but I was told there would be some ready soon. No big deal, it's dinner and that means it would be fresh so I didn't mind waiting. I got a 3 entree plate, a large orange chicken, a rice bowl, and a large drink. After we payed, I got the bag and thought it felt a little light for the amount of food I ordered. I checked, and the orange chicken was left out. The guy that forgot it didn't apologize when I went back to the cashier, he walked away. She was very nice and gave me a coupon for a free small drink or orange chicken.  I felt that was resolved and was fine. But, lo and behold, when I got home and opened my plate...there were 3 pieces of shrimp (which I waited for and paid extra for) and 2 strips of chicken and a few green beans. The plate was 90% rice!!!  $30 for rice. 
Now for tonight, I go in at 8:45 ( they close at 10). The first thing I see is no honey walnut shrimp. When I ask, I'm told they are out for the night. Really, they are out or the don't want to cook any?  So I go for my next option...orange chicken. Guess what?  They are out and will have to cook some. If they still have an hour and and 15 minutes left to sell food, maybe they should have food. We just walked out. The whole point of going out to eat is to actually get served food to eat. It is so frustrating to go somewhere and experience a complete lack of care for you as a customer. I may try another location, but with so many options I may give up Panda altogether. I guess I was spoiled by the awesome food and service from the PE in Ft. Walton Beach, FL. So far, Vegas has been awful for food and customer service.",2016-07-27 04:45:09

Though I do acknowledge the differences when it comes down to it.

YZ's is a bit confusing, it has Taiwanese/Chinese style hotpot but sell Yakitori and show cases decor that is Japanese. I ordered the Spicy Beef Hot Pot with Ponzu sauce and a side of quail eggs.

The hot pot broth was indeed spicy, came with 50% cabbage, enoki mushrooms, 3 slices of beef, imitation crab, clear noodles, tofu. The side order of quail eggs was a joke, there was only 3 and were oddly hard and rubbery in texture. Other than spicy, the broth was bland. The ponzu sauce was overly garlicky and was spicy due to it's rawness and didn't accent the flavors of the hot pot. To be honest, the items in the hot pot didn't taste fresh and my flame went out 5 minutes into eating.

The service is spotty, had to waive down the waitresses a couple of times and didn't really recommend anything or mentioned what they served at YZ. 

For $12, I left unsatisfied and they had included an automatic gratuity which had caused some confusion. Since they had an optional addition of tip below that auto gratuity, I'd rather decide if I'd like to tip a certain percentage or not.

Would skip on the hot pot here and probably order some skewers or other tapas instead.",2014-10-29 00:56:12

This restaurant opened just about two months ago according to the chef, and they still have the old signage of Kabuki outside so it was slightly challenging finding this place.  I'm glad I persevered and found it or I would have missed one hell of a treat!  Ayce lunch here goes for $20.95, not the cheapest but definitely well worth it!

I was able to sample the majority of their nigiri and just one roll.  Their nigiri is top notch, subjectively better than Yama's, Goyemon's, and Daisho's (my former top three for nigiri in an ayce).  The way they cut the fish is different in that the fish is extra long (see the pics), which makes for an awesome fish to rice ratio.  Many of the nigiri comes dressed with an appropriate sauce and is truly yummy!

I suppose the nigiri purists out there may not like ""pre-saucing"" that much but how they did it here is just right imho.  I guess you can always ask for no sauce if that's your fancy.  The singular roll I had (something's wrong roll) was awesome too.  I also had a cup of miso soup, an order of seaweed salad, and the green tea panna cotta, which were good but didn't really stand out.

I wish I didn't come here by myself so that I could have sampled more items as I can only eat so much alone.  They have a bunch of appetizer and dessert items that I would have loved to try.  I found out after my meal that I could have ordered half rolls so I'll try that next time.

This new location is much bigger, has has more seats, it's usually full but still has enough seats. people usually come here to chill and chat (for a pretty long time) so if there's no seats, just go somewhere else, you will be waiting forever, or just get take out (which I don't recommend)

I always have a hard time deciding on the drinks it's nothing special and a bit over priced) but I like how the tapioca pearls comes in small and large sizes.

The food menu is real Taiwanese food and not pre-packaged frozen foods that are heated up, they have an actual chef cooking in there. The food is OK (had better Taiwanese food before) the portions are really small for a meal, and the selection is limited.

They have a few dessert choices and I like the desserts, the shaved ice is pretty good, there's lots of toppings that i like in it.

They also have seasonal cheesecakes and tiramisu. My favorite is their tiramisu, where the lady fingers are soaked with just the right amount of espresso.

The service is consistently friendly and reasonably fast. A little slower than a Subway or its ilk, but the sandwiches are made with love, are more complex, and panini(s?) of course require time on the panini press.

Some friends had been there multiple times since it opened and had given it pretty rave reviews, so the expectations were very high. 

I'm glad to say they were met, and then some.  

Stopping in for lunch, shortly after they opened, the wife and I were quickly seated by a very friendly server.  Drink orders taken and menus in hand, we looked over the offerings, as well as the surroundings.  

While originally spurred to come in for the daily lunch specials (they post these online) we both ended up ordering off of the regular menu - that was difficult enough as most of it looked REALLY good. 

I have to give the owners some serious credit for the decor and atmosphere.  They stripped off all of the sports bar detritus than had amassed over the years, and went with exposed brick, repurposed barn siding, and tasteful art (provided by the Pop Shop Gallery apparently).  The back of the menu recounts both the story of the concept, as well as a mystery mural that was uncovered during renovations.  The end result is a very cozy and inviting environment that reminds me of the very best pubs you would find abroad.  It really feels like a great place to meet some friends and have some drinks and some good times.

Then there was the food.  The Duck confit macaroni and cheese was as good as I hoped it might be.  Rich, creamy (with a baked crust on top) and chock full of flavorful, tender duck breast.  The wife ordered the burger, which she thought might be her new favorite in town.  I wouldn't make that assertion, but I did think it was very good. The accompanying fries were perfectly cooked, and all of the sauces (made in house) were delicious.  

I've heard great things about the beer selection, but while I can't speak to that with any authority, the selection certainly seemed extensive. 

The food is a little bit pricy for the average bar food, but in light of the quality, I can't say it's not deserved.  We're both really looking forward to going back.",2010-11-26 02:03:29

the Eel bowl to my dismay was served on top of sushi rice and not regular steamed rice.  which is the traditional way.  

Later i found out that it is a Korean run restaurant.  So I must say that they should learn to make food the right way or rename it to fit their serving ways.  don't call something one thing and then serve it a different way

Then they asked me if I was japanese and I told them yes.  and asked if they wanted me to show them how to make it  the right way. and I paid for my uneaten food and left and went to mcdonald..",2011-03-23 02:45:23
rB1D3_F5cED234lqvnJK1A,46HhzhpBfTdTSB5ceTx_Og,f9NumwFMBDn751xgFiRbNA,4,15,0,3,"My dad came down to the area to visit, and while my wife and mom went shopping we decided to check out the ""grand opening"" of The Range at Lake Norman. Now I've been to shooting ranges before, and they have been rather lame. They were all outdoors where everyone had to shoot and check targets together, you had the sun baking down and blinding you and there were a bunch of crazy old guys shooting off huge guns just to feel cool. Needless to say I had some pre-conceived opinions of how I was going to enjoy my time at The Range, but luckily this place blows any range I've been to away.

It's an indoor, air conditioned range where everyone has their own little lane with barriers on both sides. Since it's indoors and the targets are automated (think of the targets you see in cop movies and shows) you go at your own pace and don't have to worry about keeping time with everyone else. 

One of the most important things to note about The Range is the staff. They were not only friendly but super helpful, and this is extremely important for anyone who is not familiar with handling firearms or with how a range works. My dad and I are both well-versed in firearm protocols, but since it was our first time there we were still made to watch the mandatory safety video. Anyone who doesn't feel comfortable after that is encouraged to speak with the staff for more in-depth rules. Also, if you just happened to go out and purchase a new gun and have no idea how it works, they are more than happy to walk you through it. Safety is the most important factor of firearms, and the staff is completely dedicated to making sure everyone stays safe by being easily approachable.

Also, The Range is very diverse in terms of who goes there. Rather than being full of a bunch of old guys there were groups of young guys, couples, families (I was surprised to see young girls handling firearms) and solo people all present and accounted for. Maybe it's a Southern thing, but you would NEVER find families (or even women) at a firing range up in New York. I think it's great, and I'm eager to come back and start introducing my wife to shooting. This is something I would never do at a range in New York, but I think she will feel very comfortable if we came here to do some shooting.

Now let's get on to the pricing. To rent one lane for the entire day is $17, or for $25 a day two people can share one lane. If you don't happen to have a firearm handy or want to try out a new model before buying it, you can rent them right at the counter. My father and I rented a handgun and it was only $8, which isn't bad at all. Now here's where things get pricey. If you don't have your own targets and ammo, they do sell it there, but it is marked up quite a bit. We spent $11 for the same box of ammo we could have picked up for under $5 in the store. So if you're there for awhile and blowing through several boxes of ammo it can add up quickly. Same goes for the targets...they have a large variety of them but they cost more than they would in the store. All in all, my dad and I spent a little over $70 to share a lane with one gun, two boxes of ammo and a pack of targets. On the plus side, they will supply eye protectors and ear muffs at no additional charge.

The Range at Lake Norman is a great place to do some target practice, whether you're a pro shooter or have no idea what the muzzle of a gun is. If you are the latter the staff are eager to help guide you through this new experience in the hopes of not only making you a safe firearms user, but also to get you hooked on this fun sport/hobby. The biggest thing keeping me from giving the place five stars is the price...if you don't have your own gun, ammo or targets the cost can rise up pretty quickly, especially if you're having a great time and blow through ammo faster than you realize. I'll definitely be coming back here, and next time my wife will be in tow.",2012-05-29 23:44:04

Relatives from HK had 3 tables in one of the smaller rooms for a small banquet. The appetizer suckling pig was quite good and not too fatty. The jellyfish that accompanied the dish was well seasoned without any fishy taste. 

They served shark fin which I'm VERY against as the shark finning industry is EXTREMELY corrupt and sharks are WAY OVERFISHED without any real control, but that's another story. Basically the old people at our table ate it while the younger more knowledgeable and conscientious folks declined. Even the waiter was understanding.

There was a spicy mushroom (battered and fried) with scallops which was tasty. It would've been a nicer presentation if each plate got 2 scallops since they were pretty small. 

Lobster was well prepared and very tasty. 

Instead of chicken, we were served pigeon which I don't eat but my mom said that Keungs makes a better one.

I love Malaysian food because it's pretty much Chinese food with an Indian twist. Island Malaysian Cuisine has all the Malaysian dishes I love, and sadly it's the only Malaysian restaurant in Vegas.

The chicken curry is oily  and only has 1 piece of chicken and potato, but it goes together so well with the Roti that I'm not complaining. I also like their Mee Goreng, which is fried  noodles mixed with shrimp, meat, tofu, potatoes, bean sprouts, chili sauce, and peanuts (sort of like Pad Thai).

The restaurant is owned and operated by a family, and the menu is very expansive. There's a picture book showing each item on the menu, which can be very helpful for new customers.

In vegas for my birthday, my sisters birthday, and one of my friends birthdays. Had a group of 8 and we wanted a place that was full nude and had alcohol so Palomino seemed like a good idea. 

I pre purchased a package and scheduled a 1:30 pick up at my hotel off the strip on Tropicana Ave for Thursday 10/30 halloween eve.  and confirmed it Tuesday So when 1:30 rolled around and no ride was there I called the club and spoke to Andrew. He said he would have the driver give me a call.  So at 1:45 the driver calls me and say he will be another 45 min needless to say I wasn't happy with that. Andrew said it was a busy night and with traffic. Had my doubts about that though.

Surprisingly The driver got there a little early at about 2:20. But to of our party already rolled out because they didn't want to wait anymore. He got us there quickly too so things started to get better.  Not a wait to get in and we were seated fast. Waitress came over a poured out first round but we didn't see her much more than that. Andrew promised us a extra pitcher of beer that we never got.  But with the short amount of time we had it was hard to finish off what we had anyway. 

Most of the girls were pretty hot and some had some great pole work.  Seems like many of them were just standing around and  not working the room. One came over to our group. She was Amazing and couple friendly. All six of us got a lap dance from her, some even more than one: ).  If she is working make sure you tip her she is the main reason for 2 of these stars. The lap dance prices are pretty average at $20.00.  

The club gave us a ride back, which saved us from a expensive cab ride.

We are big fans of the Go rooms, the adults only pool ( The large pool is now strictly 18 and older) and it's location on the strip. By and large we spent hardly anytime at all in the casino itself.  Do wish it had a cool bar or lounge.  

Plenty of Yelpers have added some helpful hints, but thought we would pass on a few too.

Check in: Might be worth using the desk vs. the quick computer check in.  We tried the quick check in and ended up staying in the Habitat tower....last year stayed in the Spa tower and enjoyed the layout a little more. The Habitat tower is guarded by Westin employees trying to give you a ""free"" gift.  Not a deal breaker, but ask for the spa tower Go rooms.  By all means, BOOK A GO ROOM.

Pool:  Don't expect to easily get a lounge chair if you show up past 10AM.  Think people run down to the pool and put towels on them at first light...play the game and do the same!  Grab a bloody mary while you are down there....they are awesome and only $5  from 8-11AM. The waitresses at the pool are swamped with orders, but all the ones we had the pleasure of talking to were super cute..I mean super sweet and helpful! If your hungry, order a burger!  Very filling and it goes well with the $20 bucket of beer.  Jeannie enjoyed the turkey wrap.  Tried the hotdog.  It had some major shrinkage going on ( supposed to be a Nathan's) and ended up filling up mostly on the fries.

Margaritaville: Stepped in there for the first time...for breakfast on the day we checked out.  A good bet and the price is on the low end for Vegas.  Have to try the bar one night...

Late night snack.  There is a food court ( two actually) that has a Johnny Rockets, a pizza place, a Panda Express-like joint and a sub  & salad place.  Had a pizza night cap twice and it was goooooood! Sausage and Pepperoni slice hit the spot.

Location:  There are so many entertainment and food options near by that you might want to be prepared to walk just a little.  Venetian & the Mirage are just within  comfortable walking distance (heels might be a challenge ladies) Harrah's & Caesar's are easy!

I just tried this place for the first time last night and now I am disappointed that I have never been here before. I love the quaint feeling you get when you walk in and by 6pm the place was crowded and the vibe was perfect. It wasn't too loud but you could tell everyone was enjoying the place.

Check out the Happy Hour menu (M-F 4pm-7pm)! Martinis and Wines are $6.50, Domestics are $3, Pizzas are $6.50 and they have a ton other food items that are priced amazingly.

I started off with the Naked Cosmo (white cranberry juice instead of regular). I actually sipped this martini slow because it was so delicious! My sister and I each ordered a pizza. I ordered the Apple Crisp Pizza while my sister ordered the Caramelized Onion Pizza. The bartender was awesome and modified our order by putting different cheeses on only half of each pizza. I don't care for goat cheese and my sister doesn't care for blue cheese. The bartender offered this suggestion of half and half like it was no big deal for the kitchen. How refreshing! Someone who isn't annoyed by modifications. 

Both pizzas were amazing! I didn't want to stop eating them, however, I  did have leftovers so that I could order the Chocolate Covered Maple Bacon dessert. Wow! What a treat. It is served with vanilla ice cream that is drizzled with chocolate sauce. 

I will be back soon to check out other menu items!",2015-03-05 14:07:18

The open layout of Vapiano affords patrons the opportunity to intermingle without hesitation.  The atmosphere is light and bristling with a restrained temerity.  First timers will need to pay attention when they're greeted or they'll be lost.

You'll get a card that places all your purchases on it.  You go where you want, get what you want, and pay at the front when you're ready to leave.  You're a big boy...you can do it.

The food here is nice.  I've only had the pizza and salads and haven't been disappointed.  Every employee I've encountered had been more than helpful.

My only advice to Vapiano would be concerning the pizza condiments at the end of the pizza counter.  A spoon and a container of crushed red pepper make for a difficult experience when putting red pepper on your pizza.  

Overall, Vapiano is bustling, fragrant, and a comfortable experience.  Give it a try.  I know I'll be back.",2013-11-15 11:15:07

The difference between the original and Little versions is that you pay $2 for an extra patty. Cheeseburgers cost $1 more than hamburgers because you get a slice of cheese.

My relatives also ordered other stuff which I forgot (and didn't bother having as I wasn't hungry). I did notice service was quite slow, especially since there wasn't many people when we arrived. It seems to be a family business, as some people who served us looked like the owner's daughters.

I liked the Bulgogi at Juns. Despite a gentle snub from an actual Korean about Jun's being ""fast food"", we decided to give it a try anyways. I attribute that to Mel C's review (thanks, Mel!)
The Bulgogi plate was generous with rice, a fresh salad with a light asian love-you-long-time type of dressing, and thinly sliced, tender, flavorful, marinated beef stir fried with onions. I ate all the meat and enjoyed it. My only wish was that it could have had more of a carmelized sear to it. That would have made it perfect.

Given this was an all time regular place of mine because it was my first time ever trying pho. Until I branched out to new restaurants,this was my regular spot. I would gamble,stop here before going home all the time. Then I went vegan. I guess more food conscious makes you notice more about what you're eating because I couldn't even tell you if this ever happened before. Two reasons,never ate anything but chicken pho,and two,I was usually either tipsy,or trust worthy & never even looked twice at my dishes. Tonight I went in to a old favorite & ordered the sautéed greens with garlic. They were wonderful,until I bit into dirt. Real true gritty dirt. Everyone knows collard greens must be washed thoroughly,a restaurant at best...I'm a country girl & knowing food,temperatures & bacteria I let the two bites of soil pass knowing my grandmas old saying ""you can't eat every bodies greens"". Then the hair came...I was done.my hair is to my hips,this hair was about 2 inches straight,mines not only curly,but completely covered in my nighttime wrap! He didn't charge me for the meal,just my drink....seeing he remembered my loyalty,I guess I'd expect better service than ""free entree"".

After an intense gym session, Nieves D. suggested Millers Ale house. You had me at Ale! I guess they just opened a Henderson location. The old one is at Town Square.

Upon arriving, it was packed! But this place is very spacious with loads of parking. We found Carl I. and Baby TJ finishing up their meal and joined them. 

32oz pitcher for $10, you can choose from white/red sangria, loaded Arnold Palmer, margarita, electric blue LIT or mojito. The pitcher wasn't as big as I imagined but it was actually perfect for just us two. The drinks on the menu are pretty cheap though. 

They have daily specials so I ordered Thursdays special which was the Prime Rib for $12.95. Comes with 1 side so I got loaded French fries. Prime rib was pretty darn delicious. Cooked to perfection and just the right amount to feed my hungry muscles. 

We also ordered calamari due to Nieves D's obsession. It was drizzled with sweet chili sauce. It was really good. It wasn't over cooked and rubbery which usually happens with calamari. 

Service was on point. Our server today was Brittney. She had loads of personality and very helpful. A little on the chatty side but she was extra funny. Overall, cheap foods, good food, cheap drinks, good drinks, great experience will be returning as soon as possible.",2014-05-30 14:33:05
gek8j1rg1MRt5v0WxV89hg,wky4BZxCELi4PZcvb11qYQ,pmOlcFQg9Vs3ONHpVNNXjA,2,4,1,0,"*PRICES HAVE INCREASED* 

Came here one Sunday to fulfill a fish and chips craving. I have never been but have driven by numerous times and was always curious.

Dated diner feel inside, with wood paneling on the walls and a bit dank and dim. Don't expect anything fancy. Not too big but we were able to get one of the last two empty tables around noon on a Sunday without a wait.

Reasons for only two stars:

1) Price - ridiculous. One piece fish and chips is $19. Two pieces is $35! This is insane for a diner meal. Yes, the portion is quite big (mainly fries tho, the piece of fish is large, but not large enough to warrant the price). I wish they would slim down on the hefty fry portion and then slim down the price with it. Although it was good (good. not great) (also - fries were overcooked and not hot) and gave me my fix was definitely NOT worth $19. 

2) Tartar Sauce - if you advertise as a fish and chips joint and charge insane prices for said fish and chips, at least serve some proper tartar sauce. Doesn't need to be 'house-made' but get a pre-made tub of good stuff like other restos do. Instead they serve those nasty solo packets that you would get in a food court setting which imo is the nastiest tartar sauce out there. But for real - if you are charging me $19 for one piece of fish and chips, you better compliment it with proper tartar sauce...

3) DON'T SIT NEAR THE BACK!!! - we learned this the hard way. Aside from it being very cold in the back, it is also right beside the back door, which is also the door to the washroom. And every. single. bloody. time. someone exits or enters you have a nice huge whiff of OUTHOUSE stank. Smells like musty sewer and the smell is overwhelming. How can I enjoy my overpriced $19 fish and chips with crappy tartar sauce while smelling and almost tasting TOILET& SEWAGE. Believe me. it's tough.

4) Service - tbh it wasn't terrible and they were friendly enough considering it IS a diner. But it lacked in a lot of ways. When we entered, instead of smiling at us or guiding us to a table or simply telling us to 'take a seat anywhere' the waitress who was holding a broom and sweeping just looked at us annoyed and asked us to move, as she wanted to sweep where we were standing. Not sure what to do we sat ourselves at one of the two last remaining empty tables which was covered in droplets of milk. We then waited 15+ minutes to even get a menu. We encountered the same wait time when trying to get a container for the leftovers and the bill. Yes, it is a diner. But if your 1 piece fish and chips served with fake tartar sauce and a side of bathroom is $19, I think you can up your service just a tad.

Overall, food is decent, prices are crazy, and seeing that we live in a city filled with great food choices, I would pass on this place.",2017-03-06 18:11:22

After a scheduling snafu at The Blue Hound, The Arrogant Butcher graciously accepted our party of 20.  I was dubious about how the service would be due to the large group, but they exceeded my expectations.  We had a dedicated server who was extremely nice and resembled a cheery Christmas Hobbit.  Drinks came out fairly quickly and after a short wait at the bar, we were shown to a private dining room.  

The have a really adventurous cocktail menu so if you're feeling brave, give it a go.  Bring your smartphone as you may have to google many of the ingredients (I enjoy exposure to new things so this is definitely a plus for me).  

The pretzel fondue appetizer is heaven on earth encased in doughy salty cheesy goodness.  The chicken stroganoff was pretty fantastic as well and they get extra points for house made pasta.  I found it odd but charming that the menu listed ""frozen peas.""  (More points for honesty!)  My dining companions seemed very pleased with their meals and one person was especially enthusiastic about the mussels and oysters.  

Desserts were fantastic as well.  The warm peanut butter cup is nothing short of amazing.  It's the kind of thing you would say is ""just okay"" in order to avoid sharing.  The salted caramel pudding was delicious as well.  (And if you all could turn that salted caramel pudding into bread pudding, I will personally head up a new religion devoted to it.)  

I learned about this restaurant a couple of years ago at the Devoured event and it's been on my to-do list.  Although we didn't set out to dine here last night, I'm certainly glad we did.  Thank you Arrogant Butchers!",2012-12-08 18:45:15

Continuing the great Las Vegas tradition of uninventiveness and mediocrity, Marinelli's is the Italian eatery at the new M Resort. 
(By the way, the steak house is called Terzetto...which frankly sounds like another Italian restaurant to me.)

If last night's meal at Marinelli's is any indication, the M Resort is not much of a player in the intense competition for our gullets.

THE DECOR: Whoever designed the room should be sent to Guantanamo for unconscionable acts of aesthetic terrorism. It looks and feels like a buffet with too-small tables and a generically psychedelic carpet (all the better to hide the stains I guess). 

Speaking of stains:  the bar at the front is odd. The counter was designed with a 4 inch slope on the outside edge. I guess cuz it looks nice. 
It wasn't so nice, however,  when I watched a man put his glass of beer down, then a second later see it slide off and break on the floor.

THE FOOD: My steak was overcooked and had the consistency of a piece of choice-beef from Vons. My friend's Osso Bucco was cold and tasteless. My other friend didn't finish his risotto. 

I'm struggling to find something positive to say....hmmmm, let me think....Okay, okay I got it...the bread was pretty good. The rest of the experience was forgettable.

THE RESORT IN GENERAL: It's nice although it doesn't look like a billion dollars to me. It's rather Red Rockish in overall feel. 
The bar upstairs at Veloce has a nice view...although they weren't equipped to make Absinthe in the proper way. 

My favorite part of the complex was The Hostile Grape: a comfortable, stylish room with a very good selection of wines by the glass, including a Sine Qua Non that is almost NEVER available by the glass. Those of you who know wine, know what I mean.
Although I must warn you, the SNQ is $49.50 an ounce.....or maybe I should say it's $49.50 an OUCH!

I'm not a buffet guy but the buffet at M Resort looked interesting. The line-up was certainly long enough. 
It's called Studio B and appears to combine the usual buffet experience with ""Show Kitchen"" entertainment where you see dishes being prepared. Perhaps I'll put a bag over my head and check it out one day.",2009-03-06 17:40:25

This visit was with the dinner group and 8 other people were at our table.  So after everyone got over their fears of eating with your hands, we ended up passing around 3 appetizers to savor.

The appetizers were all vegetarian and very similar but with slight differences.  All had tomatoes but one might have had green peppers and another may have been dressed with olive oil or avocado included.  Sorry, I don't remember the names of the dishes but they were all delicious.

After that we decided as a group to order 3 sampler platters to share although one of our group ordered a single vegetarian platter.  Talk about amazing.  The chicken dish and the collard greens were my favorites.  The vegetarian cauliflower was also wonderful.  

But the best thing about the food was waiting for the bread to soak up all the flavors of what was sitting on top of it and then eating it.  Talk about foodgasm.  

Eating with your hands isn't for everyone but if you are willing to let go of your inhibitions, this is an amazing experience.  Just be patient with the service.  Don't come here in a hurry but come to just savor everything.

brazilian steak (picana brazil)
top sirloin
lamb 
salmon
pineapple
friend banana
cheese bread ball

The bread they give you is a garlic toast that I couldn't stop eating - so good.  Our apps of the breaded eggplant and the artichokes (served cold) were a great start.  They were a little heavy handed with the vinegar on the salad which is when the meal started to turn.  I got my penne in vodka sauce which was so incredibly salty.

The location was very clean and bright.  I was surprised by the lack of flavors.  Most yogurt places have two or four more flavors.  This seemed to be lacking.  The same goes for the toppings although they did have some I hadn't seen at other places.

This is the quintessential non-chain eating experience.  Joe's grub isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for, and Brak would FAR rather pay more for good grub than suffer with a ""bargain"" meal.  Joe's delivers great value despite the high prices, because the food is that good.

I've had lots of things on the menu and loved all of it.  For some reason, I'd avoided the BBQ chicken pizza for a long time, probably because I've had others that weren't so hot.

A few minor gripes:
-Friday night, but no Thai station! So no fried rice or any of the small Thai dishes. Which can be understandable, but to charge diners the same full price for dinner when a component of the experience was missing felt a bit like a rip-off.

-Weather was cold outside, and it felt even colder inside. Perhaps so diners don't get overheated by the piping hot broth?

-Some of the employees didn't wear a uniform, so it was at times hard to tell if they were just a regular patron standing/walking around or not

-One of the employees asked if we wanted more broth poured in. Turns out ""more broth"" meant plain water, which diluted our broths.

Some of the good:
-The selection of veggies seemed to have increased slightly. And some of the items seemed to be on plastic plates now instead of all on the styrofoam plates. 

-Still love their sauces. They make for good dipping sauces, and to add to your broth. Favorite is their tamarind sauce.

The quality of the meats and seafood aren't the best, but what can you expect for AYCE. We usually get the original and spicy mongolian broth. Unfortunately neither has any flavor on their own, so flavoring them up with garlic, green onions, cilantro, jalapeno, soy sauce, etc is a must! But thankfully you can customize it to your taste.  Next time we'll try the tom yum broth and see how that goes.

they have a bunch of other really great things here too.  i've had sandwiches there (try the turkey foccacia...yuuuum) or chicken pesto salad sandwich...they have homemade pizzas for one that are unique and flaky...they have gigantic salads leaving no hunger for your appetite to squash..and they have great smoothies.

Enter Tacos Mexico, and old school spot complete with dated restaurant furnishings, a jukebox, and the savory smell of fried pork and tortillas, nummy numms. I went with the Al pastor burrito, filled with marinated and grilled pork, rice and beans. To be honest I've never had an Al pastor burrito with rice and beans, normally it's just meat, chopped onion and cilantro. This variation of the burrito was still tasty, but the addition of house made salsas was needed for that extra little kick. 

The meat was a little under seasoned and I could have done without the rice and beans, but I'm assuming they use these as filler for the burrito. All in all no big complaints and very fast service which is really all you can ask for from an all night fast food joint.",2015-10-24 20:37:41

Macarons are my precious, and the flavors here are really good. The Aztec chocolate is like a Mexican hot chocolate drink in macaron form--spicy, sweet, cinnamon-y. I have also had salted caramel, lemon, pistachio, and NUTELLAAAA. Mmmmmmmmmm. All are good, but sometimes I feel they are a bit dry? Like they were one day in the fridge too long. 

The cupcakes are really good as well. I have only had the red velvet twice but it's really tasty. I had a gemme one time, which Tiffany described as a ""gourmet Twix"" and that was a pretty accurate description. It wasn't exactly my preference, but still really good.

I chose this restaurant to celebrate my two year anniversary because I didn't feel like dealing with the strip, the people of the strip, the parking, and the crowds. 

I called a week ago and asked for a table on the patio. We ended up being seated at the best table in the house. (I will upload a picture). The hostess sat us at our table, which was literally 10 feet from the lake that the restaurant overlooks. The lighting was dim and there are beautiful trees and plants and candles everywhere. There was also a man singing wonderful Sinatra-style covers and his voice was absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how amazing he sounded and I also appreciated the fact that the live music wasn't too loud or distracting. It was calming and pretty, unlike a lot of restaurants where the band/singer is right in your face crooning as loudly as can be. 

We chose a bottle of wine from their store to go along with our meal. Although they do charge a $10 corking fee on top of the price, this particular wine still ended up costing at least $10-20 less than it does at other restaurants. 

Our waiter, Joe, was incredibly nice, friendly, and attentive. He didn't bother us too much but also came around when appropriate and his menu recommendations were spot on. We started with the Bacchus cheese and meat platter. I'll be honest, I can't remember what the hell kind of cheese and meat were on it, but everything tasted great. There were at least three different cheeses, two different pates, some apples, applesauce, and a bunch of meats. Very nice!

I ordered the Crispy Maple Duck Leaf Breast and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Frites. We also ordered a side of brussel sprouts.  The duck was the best I have ever had, hands down. It was cooked perfectly and came with this amazing sauce that perfectly complimented the crispy, juicy, flavors of the duck. Unbelievably good - so much so that I ate the entire plate! Also, I am a HUGE fan of brussel sprouts, I cook them at least three times a week at home, and these were also up there with the best I've ever had. They were tender and salty with bursts of bacon flavor. YUM. Must order! I sampled my girlfriend's steak and it was tender and cooked perfectly. I have had better, but she really enjoyed it. 

For dessert, we had the bread pudding. IMPECCABLE. I was expecting something different because this bread pudding looked and was textured more like coffee cake, but it was delicious! It came with a sauce, I can't remember what it was called, but dipping the warm bread pudding into the slightly cool sauce created flavor explosions of cinnamon and warm cakey goodness. 

Overall, I couldn't have had a better night. The vibe was calm and inviting. It was romantic. The lake was beautiful. The music was perfect and the food was to die for. Eating here made me feel like I was on vacation rather than living in Las Vegas.",2012-07-19 18:11:52

The Good: The Porters were prompt, unloaded a ton of stuff from my car and were friendly. Be sure to tip well.

I've lived in Las Vegas for 20 years and seen many ""Italian"" places come and go. Most are New York Italian but this is the first (off-strip) since (old) Roma Deli that is actually run by Italians! 

This is no deli though. It's a Trattoria which is a type of restaurant in Italy where you can enjoy home cooked Italian food for a reasonable price, and this is exactly that type of establishment.

The dad comes in the morning to cook the sauces, dolci etc. and then the rest of the family come in throughout the day to operate the restaurant. You can tell as soon as you step through the door that the place has a buzz. The decor is cosy and warm but I think it's the personalities that really make the atmosphere what it is. 

I love good food & wine, hearing the chattering of people, the clinking of glasses and the waiters talking back and fourth in Italian because it reminds me of Italy. Some lady on the table next to me wasn't a fan of the guys speaking in Italian or something and complained; I was relieved when I heard the owner tell her politely that if she doesn't like people speaking in Italian then maybe this wasn't the place for her.

Can't wait to come back! This is my new favorite spot and I will be happy to refer them any business i can to help compensate for people who can't stand authentic restaurants....I hope those people choke on their never ending salad bar!

When the food came, I was pleasantly surprised. Then more came and I was in heaven. Basically, every dish tasted really really good. My bro is a fried rice snob, and he stated the that fried rice was top notch. I really enjoyed the deep fried fish in corn sauce.. still crispy under the sauce. Their deep fried pork chop also managed to be tender and not greasy at all. The peking duck with flour and lettuce wraps were also really great. Service was good and the food came out quickly. We had a ton of other dishes that I can't name/remember at the moment. There was a LOT of food. For dessert, they had three kinds at our table: my favourite sweet tofu soup thing, a sweet sesame soup thing and the dreaded red bean soup. Two out of three ain't bad. 

All in all, it was a little less than $20 per person including tax and tip which is considered expensive for my family, but I think it's a steal. We had tons of leftovers to take home.

I will definitely be back for dinner with friends. I'm already planning on coming back here for my birthday. Next time, we're totally going to try their seafood. 

If you'd like to go for dinner, make sure to reserve about a week ahead.",2012-04-30 14:07:37

It was the latter that had me salivating, particularly when I was told that there would be a wait since the protein in question was still cooking and the just-baked bread was cooling. 

While the meat ended up being slightly dry, I savored the fresh, flaky bread, the artistically laid array of vegetables ( I went berserk with my choices), and the ""Jersey Style"" vinegar/oil/salt/oregano dressing which was what truly shot the torpedo across the ocean and into Jared Fogle's yacht. One hearty hoagie, my only lament was that I didn't go with an Italian since I feel it probably would have been more succulent.

A cup of potato salad proved to be a starchy, creamy success with a bit of celery bringing the crunch. The M&M chocolate chip cookies we had for dessert were crispy, chewy caps of joy that rivaled those of many area bakeries. 

I must add that the interiors are bright, contemporary, and inviting, the soda fountain is self-serve, the employees are enthusiastic and engaging, and the meat is sliced to order.

kEV8sHjVF6HKjXZzs-p_Mw,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,4,2,1,3,"Haven't really been to Bahama Breeze in years....but thanks to a Red Lobster gift card (both restaurants belong to Darden), and a Valentine's date for some KISS Mini Golf (review on that later), we were hungry!

Got to say, restaurant is still not bad for a Caribbean-themed chain.  Place was hoppin'!  Very, very busy.  Folks must like their congo music, eh?  Breezy.  Luckily even with no reservations our wait time for a table was less than five minutes.  Like the place - open, airy, noisy, and boy do I love the smell of Jerk chicken on the grills.  I'm really hoping that it's cooked on an open charcoal flame, but I'm pretty sure it's probably not.  Can't have everything I suppose.

After getting seated and giving our drink order (Bahama Breeze using bottles of Republic of Tea - Ginger Peach is tasty but a tad pricy) we were ready to view the menu.  It really is a bit of a mix, some Jamaican, some Caribbean, some American.  Fortunately a lot of it sounded tasty.

Wifey couldn't decide so she settled on the Island Hopper ($19.99) - appetizer sampler platter of sorts that included their signature Jamaican chicken wings, crispy coconut shrimp, onion rings, and conch fritters.  It came with sauce sides of jerk BBQ sauce, citrus mustard, and a roasted pineapple chutney.  For the most part she enjoyed it.  The Jamaican chicken wings were a bit smaller than she remembered but they were still very tasty with a peppery kick.  Coconut shrimp were indeed crispy, but light, with good hints of sweet when dipped in the pineapple chutney.  Conch fritters were only OK, a bit forgetful because they tasted more of a hush puppy with very little conch inside.  And the onion rings, well they were just onion rings.

I ended up getting the Cuban Sandwich ($10.99) and while I did like it, I should have read the menu better.  Why does Bahama Breeze put lettuce & tomato in a Cuban sandwich??  And salami???  Very, very strange.  Just do it like the Cubans guys - marinated roasted pork, good ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard between buttered Cuban bread then smooshed in a plancha till golden brown.  Simple!  Thank you Jon Favreau of Iron Man and Chef fame!  I think I would have enjoyed this sandwich a lot more without the extra fluff, but did applaud the effort of Bahama Breeze trying to make the sandwich their own.  Next time I would just order it with no lettuce & tomato, or just put it on the side.

Overall a good experience at Bahama Breeze, the atmosphere was inviting, and the service was stellar without being pretentious.  The food could use some tweaking but that's par for the course.  If this place wasn't so far from where we live I would be likely to check out their menu further or at least come down for their hoppin' Happy Hour.

Most of the shows I've gone to in the past year have been either here or at the Marquee. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Compare the friendly staff to the surly workers at the Marquee. The wonderful temperature control versus the sweltering heat. The clean, plentiful bathrooms instead of cesspool restrooms. And what about the free water stations, great cocktails, stadium seats, and a damn tasty veggie burro big enough for two?

If you did not realize this, South Point caters to families. That's why they have the bowling lanes and movie theaters. They have a kiddie pool for the little ones. Most families who come to Vegas for kids sport tournaments (club soccer, NJB Basketball or Little League baseball) will stay here. If you want hotels that caters to adults, go to the Palms, Planet Hollywood or Hard Rock Hotels. So here is my ratings:

5/5: Room: The room size is good. They were clean and understated. Who cares how beautiful the rooms are when you should be out having fun? Most rooms will have good views of the strip of the pool. 

3/5 Service: Service here is typical of non-extravagant Las Vegas hotels. 

4/5 Gambling: They has a good selection of slot machines plus they have a Poker Room. Not too many hotels have them anymore because they do not generate revenues like a Blackjack table. 

4/5 Accessibility: On the plus side, they are away from the noisiness of the strip but close enough so you don't to drive a ways away like Downtown or Lake Las Vegas. On the negative side, it is not close enough to walk to any other hotels on the strip.",2015-05-27 18:35:07

The sound of the countdown till the inevitable closure of this pretentious shithole. Don't get me wrong: I'm not going to write a review lambasting the evils of a $400 made-in-China t-shirt. For a girl as into gross consumerism as I, one would think Barney's would represent the ultimate altar at which to worship.

That said, I still work hard to earn every damn penny, and still expect a certain level of service at this price point. I will tell you that the customer service at my ghetto Target is heads and shoulders superior to that of Barney's. I have walked in with photos of an item, knowing they carry the designer, and asked them to find it for me. They take my number and email and smile and nod, but then........... crickets. I attempt to return a defective handbag (GASP!) past the sacred 30-day window in which returns are accepted. Much hemming and hawing and excuses and the bag is surrendered, mysteriously sans refund, with promises of a call from the manager. Again............. crickets. I have to stalk the handbag department to see how the Queen Manager has deigned to handle my quandary (for those dying to know, they sent the bag back to the manufacturer for repair without telling me). I walk through the shoe department, clearly lingering over a certain item, and.............. crickets. I can see a sullen young man with waxed eyebrows giving me the side eye from the back room, but............ crickets. Is it me? It's not Foot Locker, for fuck's sake. I'm not going to wave the shoe at him from across the room and holler out my size. Sorry. I'm not sure why the staff goes MIA. I'm certain that gossiping and doing each other's makeup does not take up a disproportionate chunk of their workday. I'm not 18 (read: will not make you bring out every shoe for me to try on for fun) and I'm carrying the same bag you're selling 20 feet away (read: have AMEX/will shop), so I'm not really sure what else I need to do to get some damn help.

Additionally, against my better judgement, I also sent my poor SO here to have all his suits and grown-up stuff altered when he lost weight and decided he wanted to pretend he was a J. Crew model. I figured the average tailor was not going to be on the cutting edge (heh) of this season's suit cut, but surely of-the-moment Barney's tailor would! Sadly, the seamstress, while perfectly friendly and competent, had just as many challenges with English and as little knowledge of trends as the $10-hem-while-you-wait place on the corner. The only difference was that the changing room was fancier -- she still needed an excess amount of direction, when we came to her hoping she would have the expertise to run the show. 

Sorry, Barney's. I realize you carry a lot of niche labels and items not otherwise available in retail locations in this state. In the golden age of the Interwebs, though, your benefit of exclusivity is gone. Now who wants to place bets on what store will fill their empty space!?",2012-07-19 02:27:11

Had a craving for Thai after studying for finals so i went during dinner time on a Monday night. Not exactly ""A"" material.

Pad Thai (Chicken) 7.50
For a togo order it was a bit...small. Other places fill the whole box up but one section was left empty for a wedge of lime and ground peanuts, that section could have had a few extra strands of rice noodle!
Taste wise it was...sub standard. It was missing a lot of spicy and strong flavors associated with Thai food. Sugar must have been on sale, bit into a large piece of scrambled egg and tasted more sweet then egg, or sauce, or spicy for that matter.

Yellow Curry (Chicken) 8.75
Piggybacking on the Pad Thai, yeah sugar was on sale cause there was more sweetness then anything else in this curry. Had slices of chili but no heat. Very weak curry essence. Strong coconut milk presence.

I have been here a handful of times already, and I'm slowly working my way through the menu. There is nothing I've tried and don't like. In fact I have favourites and tend to order them each time along with other dishes. Love smaller bites and being able to have several dishes in front of you at once. Every time I come I learn a little bit more about the restaurant and inspiration behind it.

Charbar, along with 2 others (Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters and Sidewalk Citizen Bakery) are located in the historical Simmons building. When you are inside it feels like the walls and old wood posts have so much to say, I wish they could share their stories.

We were able to sit on the patio one night for my husbands birthday back in August before heading downstairs for dinner. Gorgeous views on the patio and a perfect date experience. Another time I've both lunched and dined with girl friends. Dinner meetings are lovely here as well and always accommodating. I even attended a recent wine event upstairs there complete with cheese bites. 

Through my adventures the service has always been spot on. And the food incredibly flavourful. I love the variety of chimichurri sauces they have (I've tried 3: red/green/white) and as I mentioned I am working my way through the menu. One of my favourites is the Fugazza (pizza).

If your sweet tooth gets an aching, go for the berry toppings or the one with syrup and bacon. 

Next, order up a latte! I had not seen a crispy marshmallow flavor before so heck, why not try everything new?! It was very good and they offer a bunch of different flavors in case that doesn't tickle your fancy. If you're not the coffee-going type, then will tea do?

It is in prime location in South Park in the prestigious Piedmont Row (where the Starbucks used to be). Service was very friendly.

They also have WiFi, but don't go here thinking you're going to crank out a bunch of work. I found it a tad slow and my husband and I were the only ones in there. Maybe once they get more of a crowd, they'll bump up their internet package. Although the WiFi was their weakest link, they have lots of outlets. Oh, let me not forget to mention their very clean bathroom.

The only negative was the cramped seating in the show room. This is a pet peeve of mine, because to me it is an obvious example of the hotel putting their dollars before their guests' comfort ... NOT classy, and NOT what I would expect from a Wynn property.

VIBE 
Subdued. Sophisticated. Sexy. A fantastic first date place where you can actually have a conversation (unlike nearby Sorrel).  This place reminds me of one of my favourite places in NYC, Balthazar. Lots of French influence permeates with burgundy banquettes and studded leather chairs. Love! 

Staff are exceptional in attention and knowledge. Not something you'd think of for a place located above the Over Easy breakfast spot. That said, it's a nice surprise! 

WE ATE/DRANK
Hendricks and tonic was good and boozy (but cucumber for summer). I had the Flowers of the Fall  --Dolin Sec, Four Roses bourbon, lime, egg white, lavender-butter syrup, laphroaig mist. It's reminiscent of a bourbon sour. It is STRONG. 

We split the Joe Lois dessert, topped with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Staff said it was a favourite. It didn't disappoint but an old fashioned will go much better with it, than the Flowers of the Fall.

In last-minute fashion, I scoured yelp for a cute boutique hotel in Scottsdale. Hotel Indigo was running a special, and when I compared it to other local hotels, this place is as bud-quality-get (quality within budget) as they come! Just to give you an idea: it was 60% less expensive than The W and Hyatt.

Location: Centralish Scottsdale within walking distance of A LOT! Quiet neighborhood (what in Scotts isnt?), with good views depending on your room. 

Service: Friendly, fast, casual and comfortable. 

Bar: Deliciously packed and very well served. I had a cocktail or two on a Monday night, and really enjoyed the free shot (some sports team won?) after a few glasses of wine. 

Amenities: I never got to the gym (shocker), but the Pool was amazing! I repeat: AMAZING! Heated, empty, and a great way to spend the afternoon with my squirrel-friend.

Room: I stayed on the 4th floor in a room with a sunset view. I thought it was styled interestingly enough for a hotel. It felt less homey and more modern, which I like in hotels. Things I really liked: The light built into the headboard (note: switch is on the headboard), the hole in the shower to hang your towel/bathing suit, the circular mirror, the oversized cacti painting that turned the room green during the sunset, wall-sized window, FREE WIFI! :D

I have two complaints, but neither were deal-breakers and I don't recommend you let them get in your way. 1) I could hear the people next door, and for a fairly empty hotel, I was disappointed I wasn't given a more secluded room away from other guests. 2) The bed was less comfortable than other local hotels (Read: The W). The pillows more than made up for it, as that's my ultimate deal breaker. 

Overall: great quality at an amazing price! For the business traveler needing somewhere to set-up shop, or the leisure traveler looking for a sheikh yet affordable stay.",2010-05-17 19:17:02

First a word for the wary, it's super popular so make sure that you get a reservation. However, I went for lunch, so I will be reviewing that.

My friend Cam and I love our BYOBs. It's an awesome way to enjoy your food properly without the hassle of stumbling through your budget and the often meager selections. Cam is the wino and I pick the food [it works] today we had a Williamette Valley Pinto Gris 2013 which is fruity and perfect for so many items on this menu. 

Walking in the first things that I noticed was the smell of Brussel Sprouts [the rave] which automatically told me that it was going to be an elongated space which a direct line from the kitchen to the reception space [wind tunnel] which is perfect for speed and customer service allowing any potential short staffed scenarios to be minimized. I seated myself at one of the two seaters on the left side of the room. Immediately ahead and behind me you could find chalk board with the specials from the menu. Perfect. Unfortunately my current new shoutout item of grilled octopus is only a dinner item [:-( I will be back for that]. 

The menu is short and sweet on a single slim placard divided in beginning, mains and sides, the deserts you are told by the waiter. We were brought our waters [with lemon of course] and wine glasses promptly but he scattered to give us time to order. 

We started with a beginner to share the Vegetable Tempura in a Japanese Aioli. There are two veggies, carrots and asparagus and they are just slightly battered where the entire vegetable is covered but not drenched. Delightful. What a great start.

I was torn between two dishes for main but settled on the Wild Mushroom and Roasted Squash Pappadelle with Rosemary crumbs and Chevre. I love it, however I do not consider it perfect. The portion was just right, the Chevre was meltaway to moisten and enhance you mushrooms, the shrooms were lovely and woody but the pappadelle were slightly too al dente for me. Maybe an extra 15-30 seconds would have been good for me. Oh well. I sized filled me up well. Cam got the Grilled Chicken burger that came with greens. I personally am not a Burger go-to burger but it looked delicious. Beware of the fluffy bun. 

What I can't forget. The side of Brussel Sprouts. How could I smell it and not get them? Seriously. Duh. Anyways, first of all this is not a side, this is an appetizer and perfect to share, almost too much. They are charred roasted to perfection, crispy as all heck and accompanied with super salty candied bacon. Perfect, perfect, especially with the fruity wine. Weird, I know! But it did it for me.

At this point I was satisfied and full but Cam wanted desert. There were two available, either a Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and a tri-flavored icecream with pineapple pieces and a maraschino cherry that made it in a icecream pineapple upside down cake in a bowl. Great, great! Love the fruit variety but I will say that those chocolate lovers will be disappointed. 

Between the desert and the pappadelle I had to knock off a Star because It was just not perfect for me. But that is just my opinion, but kill me. 

However, I am beyond intrigued to come back to try the Octopus. Come for a great lunch!",2015-03-05 17:39:39

We decided not to go with the hibachi grill as all members of the party has to opt for the grill.   However I am a sucker for the hibachi grill fried rice. I dont know it is - probably the child hood visits to Benihana and the buttery goodness seeping from the rice.  But Ohjah provides a more affordable experience of what you can get from Benihana.

The fried rice was perfect with huge chunks of chicken, not over cooked.  We ordered the sashimi combo which came with 20 pieces.  This was such a bargain.  5 pieces of tuna, salmon, yellow tail, garlic tuna, and super white tuna.  The pieces were gigantic, fresh and for $23 was worth it.

I've never had the fries here, so I can't review those, but OH THAT ICE CREAM!!! I don't know how they do it, but Sweetie Fry makes the creamiest, richest, most flavorful ice cream! They always have unique, unexpected flavors, which turn out to be surprisingly good, like cilantro-lime (thought this combo was only for gucamole? Think again!) and goat cheese-honey! My favorite flavors are peanut butter, which has a great, intense peanut butter flavor, and the chocolate raspberry marmalade. Just thinking about them is making my mouth water!

The staff is always so patient, allowing you to sample however many flavors you want (which is a total necessity given that their flavors are sometimes outside-of-the-box). I appreciate that they take the time to prepare the bite with all the toppings listed on the menu (like pouring carmel and peanuts over your sample of goat cheese ice cream) so that you get an accurate impression of the flavor. I also LOVE the fact that you get a small ""sweetie scoop"" on top of your order, so you can test a new flavor out (to prepare yourself for your next order, of course!).

Sea Salt Cream!...Honey Boba!...Cold Brew Coffee (if you arrive early enough to try some)!...Milk Teas & Tea Lattes made with excellent quality teas!...Fresh, real ingredients (like real Taro!)...Egg Custard Pudding to add to your beverage... Brew Tea Bar goes above and beyond most spots in town. The reasons are plentiful to believe the hype. You can knock their seating or their line, but simply put, Brew Tea Bar is the best in town for Tea Lattes, Milk Teas, and boba in general.

It's a menu worth exploring. I would confidently order from any section and anticipate enjoying a good drink, but if you're looking for a place to start check out one of the following:

Oolong Latte w/ Sea Salt Cream (I prefer the smokier variety of oolong)
Hokkaido Milk Tea (Shout out to my Buddy Ethan for turning me on to this one!)
Trio Slush if you're in the mood for dessert 
Taro Milk Tea made with ample pieces of fresh taro
Silver Needle w/ Lychee if you prefer an elegant and subtle tease of light, delicate flavors on your tongue 

Their customer service is excellent throughout the ordering process and after as well. Like other good establishments, Brew Tea Bar is willing to re-make it for you to get it exactly how you like it (less ice, less sweet for me.)

They are easily the best in town for Milk Teas and Tea Lattes. If you're all about the fresh fruit smoothie/slush you may still want to make a trip to #1 Boba or QQ. I usually don't understand the eruption of 5 star reviews that seems to accompany so many places the last couple of years, but at Brew Tea Bar it is entirely earned.",2015-08-08 14:58:20

 I really like how this hotel caters to the locals as well. We always see people we know there. 

The buffet is ok...I would not pay to go unless I got 2 for 1. GVR and M are way better but the price is much lower here. Its a decent place to go if your there anyways.

I heard Michaels restaurant is suppose to be amazing! I have never tried it but out love too eventually. Maybe on our next free stay-cation.

Also, I am a big fan of their spa as well. They have great locals discounts (usually %20 off Sund- Thurs). They use to have juice and coffee out for you to drink but now you have to ask for it. I guess that they said their staff was stealing it over night....still I like when you use to be able to just get them as you liked.

We used my Groupon deal (1 appetizer and 2 entrees) that expired the following day.  The menu had a decent selection.  Not as big as the sister bar (Remedys) but there was enough options.  

The decor is nice.  Red and black colors with velvet panels and curtains.  It definitely had a Frank Sinatra era feel.  Gorgeous red chandeliers and comfy plush chairs.  

Our waitress, Chelsea, was GREAT! She educated us on the daily events that happen at Elixir and guided us on the menu.  She paced out our food order perfectly so we had time to enjoy each dish. 

We ordered the chicken nachos. The marinated shredded chicken was delicious.  I like how they put the sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side so it didn't make the chips soggy. They serve generous portions here for sure.  I had  the t-bone pork chop and my date had the seared beef medallions.  Both super delicious and the presentation was as if I was dining at a fancy restaurant on the strip! I was very surprised.  The side salad that came with the entree looked like an entree itself.  Big plate and the house salad was made of dark greens and not the typical romaine lettuce.  

We will definitely come back to check out the weekly poker tournament, the live entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays and definitely the food.

Thank you other yelponies for leading me to this glorious fine dining palace. I really doubted this place was any good from the outside and honestly the reviews pushed me to try and it really is as good as it gets in the Goodyear area. 

My wife and I ordered the pork lo mein, the orange chicken, and the general tzou's chicken. All three dishes were decently priced, well flavored, and had generous portions. 

The lo mein had the perfect amount of oil texture with strong authentic flavor and wonderful tasting pork strips.

The orange chicken tasted more of citrus then of spice which is my wife's ideal plate ( I had to dump chili oil on it, BAM, but it was very good with or without it) 

The General's chicken did not surrender and was fantastic with the perfect amount of spice and seasoning while surrounded by well placed and cooked broccoli. 

Dishes range from 7-10 dollars each most in the middle of the range at 8.95

Taste:  This was perhaps the most bland pizza I have ever had.  The crust didn't seem like it was cooked all the way . . . this is just a guess but I think it was a frozen crust.  I think a 2x4 with salt sprinkled on would have more depth and interesting flavors than this pizza.  4 out of 10.

We played some pool without concern that someone else was waiting for the table to clear, and wasted some time playing some computer games at the bar. 

The bartender was incredibly nice. She checked in on us at just the right moments, without making us feel like she was hovering. 

After reading the good reviews on their burgers, we got a few and some appetizers and were a little disappointed. They seemed like regular bar burgers with regular fried bar snacks. However, the spices on the fries really did add something. Aside from that, nothing too special.

I was (and still am) a regular here, though since it's reno with a much more ""proper"", well-lit, and rather less-inspired atmosphere... I guess I have no choice but to actually consider the quality of the food. 

Some points:
- Drinking too much of the broth leaves one rather parched.
- Any drink with red bean and coconut milk is a solid choice.
- Open 24 hours.
- The noodles themselves are thicker than preferred. Somewhere in between what they should be and Ho Fun.
- Hearty servings for the price.
- Open 24 hours.
- Washrooms are normally very clean, and I confess. I've run in off the streets to use them in a couple emergency situations. And run out just as quickly.
- There is a server there who is unabashedly trying to position himself as a pop-star. Occasional live entertainment.
- Open 24 hours.

I've been here a few times, and I always get the same thing - grilled cheese. So much variety Haha! 

When hey first opened, I ordered a grilled cheese and they put it on this multi-seed bread, which was really good, better tasting than on wheat. Another time I cam back it was on a different bread, not sure which it was, but it wasn't my favorite. The last time I went in, I asked about the bread and they told me the kind they had, excluding the multi-seed. When I asked if that was it, I was told well yea, a seed bread, but you wouldn't want that. Actually, that is the one I want. If I am the paying customer,  don't tell me what I do or don't want. That was my only flaw with this place. Otherwise, I like the food, and their service is pretty good too. They are always smiling and walking around to see if you need anything. 

I have only been for breakfast, so I don't know what is available for lunch. But they have the standard breakfast items - eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, etc. with bread items for purchase.

Each table was full- while waiting in line, we coveted a few seats opening and quickly snatched them!

Menu- there are definitely some unique drinks that I haven't tried before. While I really was interested in trying the salted caramel cream topping, the cold outside warranted a warm drink. My server altered me that while it's possible to add salted caramel to hot drinks, he wouldn't recommend it.  Huh, okay- guess I'll have something to look forward to for next time!

I ordered the hot Hokkaido milk tea with honey boba- Oh my stars!  Hands down, one of the best top 3 boba drinks I've had in my life!!! I'm still reminiscing over the perfect, sweet, creaminess.  My husband got an iced almond with honey boba- he was pleased, too.

I say to go to the Centennial Center instead of the Summerlin area, if you really want to experience this place for what it really is.

Never got a chance to try the food at the Summerlin area actually, the people were too fucking rude for me to want to even put up with their shit long enough to be seated.
I was with someone, and we were coming back from Red Rock when we stopped here to eat. I figured since the Centennial place was so awesome, I could expect the same thing here.
We walk in, there's no seat-yourself sign. So we stand there, looking at all the empty tables, but  the hostess tells us to wait and walks off. Some teeny-bopper with pink hair is at the cashier, and after a few minutes of the hostess not returning I ask here if we could just seat ourselves, like the other location. She gets all annoyed that we DARE bother her and tells us to just wait. After another few minutes of watching the hostess walk back and forth, not really doing anything but ignoring us, we walk out.
Wasn't going to deal with that horse shit, and pretty disappointed that the customer service quality wasn't the same as the other location. They are run by the same people right?

I really don't understand how the people that work here are so rude compared to the Centennial location. Maybe it just reflects the customers that come in, since we all know everyone that lives in Summerlin is an asshat. But there's no need to assume a sour attitude with everyone that walks in.

Luckily we didn't eat here, I've heard that the food isn't as good as the other one either. It pangs me to give this a shitty review cause I really do like the restaurant, I just think this location needs a big hug or something.",2013-04-12 01:41:16

There is a small bar. Also, there is seating al frasco, too. In one corner, there is a round table for a cozy get-together.

The service is pretty good- the staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is nice. It's a little small (but there is also seating at the Bar, and al fresco, too). The pizza is pretty good- thin crust, good sauce, good cheese. My husband & I shared a pie (had leftovers). I think, maybe, my husband (who is half Italian) thought it was good, but not spectacular.

As a board games junkie, I'm surprised to hear a review say it's not as ""cozy"" as Snakes and Lattes. I find Snakes and Lattes almost overbearing with how crowded it is (and no reservation system,) and how dim the lights can be, and Riddle Room has such a sense of community to it - for once, the people who work there actually care about you and go above and beyond.

BIG shout outs to Phil, who we had as our server and who really went above and beyond with everything. Enthusiastic and considerate, he noticed we wanted to watch the Jays game and went out of his way to make sure that we could stream it there. He also just chatted with us and made us feel extremely welcome, like the Riddle Room is a place to meet new and old friends. Thanks to Phil, we'll definitely be back!!

Food: amazing! Try the Japanese popcorn (tossed in a sweet seaweed mix)- it's such a treat to the tastebuds and for $2 it can't be beat!

Drinks: my boyfriend is a coffee snob, but he and I both adored the drinks we ordered here! Riddle room is KNOWN for its talented barista and its phenomenal latte art (heard they're having a latte art competition coming up, too! How exciting.) bf got the Cortado and I got the lavender earl grey. We were both very impressed- this place has better coffee than some specialty coffee shops down the street.

Board games: cards against humanity, Telestrations, settlers of catan, etc...you'll find the most popular games here and I hope the collection increases. No complaints, though!

Everything else: absolutely spectacular. I love how innovative Riddle Room is with their videogame selections and equipment- they're prepared for everything! Our server even offered us a charger cable for our laptop when it ran out.

Great place to go with a group of friends. The restaurant is very lively and loud as they shout greetings in Japanese every time a customer comes in and leaves. It keeps things entertaining, but can be hard to have conversations without yelling across the table. Also, there were 3 birthdays in the hr and half we were dining. They brought out colourful shots, sang the birthday song, and got half the restaurant involved to sing and clap along. Im considering bringing a friend here for their birthday to give them the spotlight next time.

Their plates are smaller, although they do have a few larger dishes but their menu is set towards sharing. 

I went on a Saturday night with a friend. We sat at the bar since it was just us two, but if we wanted a table, it would've been a 30-45min wait. We got a pitcher of Sapporo to start, pumpkin croquette, miso saba, cheesy baked oysters, chicken karagge, and seared salmon sushi blocks. The salmon sushi was our favourite - the fish had a smoky flavour, and a velvety texture with just the right amount of tanginess from the ponzu sauce.

We both got our free birthday burgers. Not only did we enjoy the food(which was actually 100% correct and perfectly done this time), but we had a great time and enjoyed our overall experience. In recent visits, we have had many complaints and issues, so bad that we've debated ever going back here. Since we were getting free food anyways, we figured we would try again. Melissa was amazing. She was on top of our bottomless fries refills, rootbeer float refills, and even noticed we didnt have napkins or silverware and brought those to us before we even noticed. She was very busy, had so many tables, but she still took such good care of us. The other servers should take notes from Melissa, she is the best server we have ever had at Red Robin. 
  Only a couple of small issues to bring to managment attention:
1.) No light on our booth, light above us was blown. It was difficult to get good lighting for birthday pics
2.) The food took a little long to get to us, but we were in no rush, it came out hot and fresh, and was all correct.
3.) One of the female servers who is alittle on the plus size( no shame in that as I am as well), had the back of her shirt pulled up, showing her back side and slight underwear showing. Maybe an undershirt would he helpful?
4.) There was a dirty towel sitting in the same place on a ledge near us the whole time we were there.
These are the reasons I have a 4 instead of a 5. I was actually pleasantly surprised with our experience and I will continue to go back, especially if we can keep.getting Michelle for our server, or ones.just like her. I also.have to mention the hostess(didn't catch her name). She was such a lovely girl. She greeted us and sat us promptly. She was such a sweet girl and had a genuine  kindness and beautiful smile. On the way out the door, she actually got to it and opened it up for us befire we got there. She set the tone for the experience, as she is the first and last one we see. This is the experience we and everyone else should get every single time. These girls have really raises the bar, hopefully we can expect consistency in our future visits. Thank you girls and the rest of Red Robin employees who worked last night, for making it such a nice birthday dinner for us.

P.S. Happy Birthday, Melissa!",2016-07-15 05:09:40

The staff behind the bar were incredibly helpful with helping us choose a drink. These guys definitely knew their stuff. In addition to craft cocktails, they also have a wide variety of beers available, both draft and cans/bottles. I prefer lighter beer so the bartender suggested the Bonus Round Blonde which is brewed for them by SunUp Brewery, and it was exactly what I was hoping for. We also split an order of the fried pickles which were a bit on the spicy side for me, but delicious. The games are all on free play and the selection included some of my favorites like Centipede, Galaga, Mortal Kombat, and Jurassic Park (complete with hydraulic bench.) The only things I would change is to make the chalkboard with the drink selections a little more simplified, as there is a lot going on and it's kind of hard to take it all in. It also would have been helpful to have had physical paper menus to look at the food/drink offerings. This is an awesome new place run by some people who really know what they're doing.

I took the family plus my parents to Tay-Do tonight for dinner.  None of us had been here before, but I really believe in yelp reviews.  I assured them that my fellow yelpers would not let us down.  They still had their doubts.

The server didn't speak good English, so that was not a good start to the evening.  She also did not take our drink orders, she just brought us tea.  Well, we had two young kids at the table, so they obviously weren't drinking tea!

To start off, we ordered some spring rolls.  A few minutes later, the lady took our dinner orders.  I ordered #90, my mom ordered #88, my wife ordered #94, my dad ordered #67, and my daughter ordered #14.

About five minutes later, our spring rolles arrived with some fish sauce.  They were small, but OH BOY were they hot and delicious.  We dipped them in some siracha and fish sauce and they were just lovely.  My parents really liked them too!

About 15 minutes later, our dinners were served one by one.  First up, my dad's chicken, rice, and black beans (#67).  We all tasted it and were very pleased with the unique flavors, fresh vegetables, and the perfection with which the dish was cooked.  I peeked into the kitchen and saw an old man cooking.  I knew then that this man was special.

Then my mom's dish arrived.  Hers was chicken and rice noodles, among other things (#88).  I didn't try her dish since mine was the same thing, but with beef and shrimp.  Then my daughter's chicken fried rice (#14) arrived.  It smelled freaking amazing!  I knew that if it tasted half as good as it smelled that I would fall in love with Tay-Do.  As luck would have it, the fried rice tasted even better!  I have found my next food affair.  Again, I peeked at the chef knowing that THIS GUY knows what the hell he is doing.  

Best fried rice I've ever had!  And that's a Chinese dish!  This guy is making better Chinese food than all the Chinese restaurants in the area!

Finally, my chicken, beef, and shrimp (#90) arrived mixed with wide rice noodles.  It smelled so good and tasted even better.  I drizzled some fish sauce and siracha on the dish and that put it over the top.  It was hot, fresh, perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned.  I've never tasted food quite like this.  I tasted my wife's dish, which was the same as mine, save for egg noodles (#94).  I definitely recommend the rice noodles.

Everyone loved their meals!  On the drive home, we were still drooling because the amazing after tastes were still thrilling us.  We literally talked about the dinner for at least 15 minutes afterward.  

I can't wait to go back and drill my way through the menu.  In addition to having awesome food, you can call ahead, they'll cook it, you show up, they serve you, and then you eat.

Love.  It's what makes Vietnamese food, Vietnamese food.",2015-02-17 01:55:17

The service here is always slow but the last two times I've come in it has taken them over 30 min to get my food out to me which is my entire lunch break so there's no time to actually eat my lunch. 

The last time I was in though was definitely my last time visiting. I had ordered two of the same sandwiches in two different sizes, and someone else had ordered the same sandwich as well but just one, and someone brought me one of the two sandwiches I ordered and left so, okay I look in the bag, pull out the sandwich, realize it's just one.. I'll keep waiting for the second one. Then the second bag comes out with two sandwiches in it which I guess is my original order, the employee picks up the bag he gave me first and hands it to another customer since apparently that was their sandwich, that I already had and opened.

Our server was sweet and on-point. She made sure we were taken care of!
She suggested the Double Truffle fries as a starter. They were meh - we would've been fine without them. Get the Sweet Potato fries instead.

I love the ambience and location of this one though. It is convenient and the brick walls give off an urban feel.

Here is why this location receives one star:
A couple weeks ago, I was getting off work. I worked 10 hours on set that day, directing a video shoot. Like most of my days, it doesn't end right after work so I stopped at this location for my usual iced Americano.

This is my order ""A grande iced Americano with no room"". This may seem like i'm being petty but the barista gave me an American which was, I kid you not, 3/4 full. No room means, literally no room because I don't add anything to it. And I understand, that maybe she heard ""extra room"" instead of ""no room"" so politely I let her know that I asked for no room. She goes, ""do you want more ice?"" WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THIS. Of course I do not want more ice, the point of ""no room"" is for ""more coffee"". So I said, 'No I'd like more coffee please'. And she rudely grabs my cup, huffs at me and adds a fuck ton of ice . A FUCK TON. So much so that the lid does not close on my drink, which means my straw also does not fit in my drink. She slides this insult of a drink towards me and walks away. 

Since I was already tired that day, and irritated with this barista's horrible customer service, I grabbed the drink took it outside and dumped out the ice.

I'm not usually one for negative reviews but I'm a firm believer in good customer service and this location did not offer it.

Just thought I'd give future customers a heads up.",2014-12-01 04:34:57

I've been dying to come to  J-Town to try the restaurants in this complex and my first stop was Shiso Tree! I had seen so many pictures and snaps from different people visiting this restaurant so naturally, I had to try the food for myself. 

As an appetizer, we got the special - Japanese Poutine. This dish was full of flavour and the gravy had a very unique taste. The gravy could have been hotter so that the cheese could have melted better but as a dish overall, I the flavour profile was on point -- you could taste the dashi gravy and I loved that it was topped with shredded nori. A must eat if you go! 

For mains, we got the sukiyaki pasta and the unagi pasta. Both were very flavorful -- the unagi was super creamy and the sukiyaki was lighter and more refreshing. I did prefer the unagi and on the day we went, it was definitely a popular dish as I saw many unagi spaghetti plates moving out of the kitchen! Amongst those plates, I also saw lots of the clam spaghetti too so I made a mental note to try that dish the next time I visit along with dessert.

The only issue with happy hour was the service was sloooooow, but at least the view was pretty while we were waiting. When we were seated for dinner, the hostess seemed stress and said she was 'so busy' but the restaurant was only half full... makes you wonder what it normally like. We were seated and served the amuse bouche of chicken liver... not something I liked, but the husband liked it alright. The popovers were very tasty, no need to go on about those.

Seared just right, juicy, and all kinds of delicious. My only issue with the steak was that mine was not properly rested so it bled everywhere... kind of gross to have a pool of blood on the plate. Despite this, It still tasted wonderful. The sides, however, were a different story. We had tater tots and the broccoli mac and cheese.. both sound so good, both were totally bland and boring... we didn't even bother eating them or taking them home. Then came dessert.... well, it should have, but we ended up waiting a long long time for them to come out. They did give us complimentary coffee for the wait, so that was nice, but it took a crazy amount of time to get them. I had the crepe souffle which was absolutely delicious. It was very eggy, but the acidic sauce cut through it very well and complimented it beautifully. The husband got the chocolate peanut butter dessert, which was also very good, served with wonderful banana ice cream.... It reminded me of a peanut butter and banana sandwich... in a good way.

Featuring a pair of televised football games but lacking jazz, patrons, and appropriate descriptions on the menu the meal began with a single cup of acrid and luke warm coffee before I requested a fresh brew that finally arrived over forty minutes later and moving on to food choices the most consistent fact spanning the items selected was simply that of blatant misrepresentation; the Monte Cristo with 'fresh fruit' delivered with a Heinz Grape Jelly packet and the ""Vermont Maple Syrup"" also Heinz - a corn syrup bastadization of maple syrup fresh from Pittsburgh.  With overcooked eggs and flavorless ham dominating earlier selections while the chicken and waffles was laughable at best it was only the two sticky buns slathered in 'syrup' and the surprisingly soft and delicate lemon pancakes that prevented the meal from total disaster, but even at $20 the whole experience was not one I'd recommend to anyone, ever, especially with Novecento next door.",2013-11-16 18:46:25

Just briny enough to please any palate, and the cocktail sauce had an awesome kick to it.  The sommelier was helpful in choosing a wine, and I definitely recommend asking him for a recommendation based on what you are eating.  Following the appetizer we had salads, which were crisp and beautifully presented.  Ordering one to split among two people is more than enough, and they are happy to divide the salad between two plates for you (always a nice touch).

For entrees two people in our party had steaks (filet and ribeye, I believe), and two had seafood entrees.  The meat-eaters said that the steaks were some of the best they had ever had, and the seafood dishes were cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.

FgZzoOxAHPUeWyiBp2Vg0Q,u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A,4,1,0,1,"When we were in Las Vegas, one of the restaurants that were on my must try list was Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bistro. It had won a couple of Opentable Diners' Choice Awards for Best French in Las Vegas and Fit for Foodies. We decided to go for brunch because there were other restaurants that we wanted to go for dinner, and actually, brunch at Bouchon sounded like such a good idea!

We didn't make a reservation beforehand and just walked-in for breakfast. It was around 9:30am, so we didn't expect the restaurant to be completely full with customers. After I did some research for this blog post, I realized that Bouchon doesn't actually take any reservations for breakfast and brunch; only walk-ins! We originally wanted to sit outside at their patio, but we were hungry so didn't bother waiting for it (~20 minutes). So, we were almost immediately seated inside near their patio.

What did we order?
We skipped the viennoiseries and pastries because I wanted to check their Bouchon Bakery out on the main floor of The Venetian (and underneath their clock tower). Hubby ordered Le Burger Bouchon ($19.50) and I had their Tartine du Jour ($17.00), an open sandwich. The topping of the day was tuna salad.

After we ordered, we were given complimentary bread and butter to enjoy during our wait. It was a classic French  baguette but shaped in a beautiful braid! I saw one of the servers holding a long untorn braid of this baguette, and it was amazing. Anyway, the bread was tasty and I loved the texture because it wasn't too hard of a baguette.

For some reason, our order took longer than other customers' breakfast. I have a feeling it was because we ordered dishes that took more time than other simple breakfast dishes (eg. omelette, eggs, bacon, etc.), but I'm not 100% sure why it took longer.

When it finally arrived, hubby and I were both pleasantly surprised at our dishes because the portions were huge! The potato fries were so perfectly cooked: golden brown, crispy, and so incredibly delicious...they got me so excited.

My sandwich was served with olives, fresh lettuce, and pickles along with my huge side of fries. Topped with boiled eggs, thinly sliced radish, and some parsley on top, it was delicious! I hadn't had tuna salad in a long time, so I enjoyed them very much.",2015-06-22 21:46:40

What is there that can be said? It's a Wal-Mart. Not the best one I've ever been to and certainly not the worst. I end up here at least a couple of times every week to grab groceries, sundries, etc. It's just too convenient having everything under one roof. The prices are also still really good despite creeping up a bit. I was just here yesterday to buy an ink cartridge for my printer and it's cheaper here than at Office Max next door! Go figure.

A couple of tips/notes/observations:

- Do NOT come here on a weekend or (especially) the night before a holiday! Holy crap! Busy doesn't even begin to describe the chaos under this roof during those times!

- I am surprised how many people confuse the words ""Enter"" and ""Exit"" in regards to the main doorways. People charging like hell out of the store as I'm walking in thru the ""Enter"" side. It happens all the FREAKING time! 

- I know the old joke is ""They have 30 registers and 2 cashiers"", but that really does happen here a lot! 

- I'd say its a 70/30 split to rude/surly/indifferent employees to friendly ones. Most don't seem to really care too much, but I really have come across some nice, helpful people there.

-Tons of parking available, but be aware that numb nuts drive diagonally through some of the lanes and just drive like brain dead maniacs in general 

It's a Walmart and a fairly serviceable one at that. Honestly, is there actually a 5 star Wal-Mart anywhere? If so, I'd like to know lol....

..I have run in to some 1 star Wal-Marts(one in Orlando comes to mind..Yikes!)...so this place could do worse.

Event: Dinner
Menu items: Roasted rotisserie chicken, chicken feathers, chino salad and mac & cheese

Roosters, bar-style communal tables and stools and a lot of frying and roasting happening in the kitchen, are the first few things you notice when you come to chef David Adjey's Chickery in the Fashion district in Toronto. Yes, the man behind the famous Food Network Canada show, the Opener, opened his own fast-food chicken joint over two years ago on Spadina Avenue. Offering lovers of all things chicken an alternative to traditional fast food spots, chef Adjey is serving a mean chicken and even meaner sides!

What you also notice, asides from the tall man covered in tattoos, walking behind the counter checking on his food, is the quality of the meat, sauces and salads that are outputted daily for lunch and dinner time. Serving only organic chicken from Beretta Organic Farms, creating home-made sauces from scratch and serving salads with fresh ingredients, The Chickery puts a new spin to good ol' fast food.

Chicken feathers is what Chef Adjey called the great tasting strips of chicken that are lightly coated in batter and spices and served with an option of 3 of his home-made sauces: Chickery sauce, smokey ancho bbq and buttermilk ranch. The deep fried coating on the chicken is light and firm while the chicken is super moist and juicy. The secret to the crunchy and airy fried goodness, as the chef revealed to me, is letting the chicken dry for a little bit after dunking it in the batter and flour, before it goes in the fryer, therefore allowing for the batter to stick to the chicken and keep the meat flavour pocketed in, as he puts it. Brilliant!

As an alternative to it's fried version, chef Adjey is proud of it's roasted chicken dish. Hundreds of chickens are roasted daily in his restaurant and coated in a secret spice mix (over 18 spices blended together) and then put in the wonderful roasting machine, for over 2 hours. Once again, achieving a delicious, tasty and juicy piece of meat.

If all there was to The Chickery was chicken, then it wouldn't be a complete meal experience, and chef Adjey knows that. So much so, that he decided to add even more comfort to his dishes with delectable sides, one of them being the ooey-gooey mac & cheese, coated with breadcrumbs and spices, then oven-baked to perfection. Simply delicious.

Word has it, The Chickery is expanding to new locations across Toronto and the GTA, and even the Middle-East, so stay tuned for a location near you!

Buen Provecho,

Finding Bouchon can be a challenge.  If you're looking for it, go to the front desk and look to the right. There is a sign with elevators, and thats what you want to take to Bouchon.

Now that we go there, we sat at the bar while they prepared our table, and sat down pretty much on time.  I let the waiter chose for me, as I was feeling optimistic.  I ended up with Veal Cheeks for starters, and the Sea Bass for the main course.

They also have all kinds of other medical supplies including jackets, lab coats, medical shoes, stethoscopes, watches ext.

I attended on this past Sunday, and ate my way through the many local restaurants that were there.  It was well-run, it happened to be a beautiful day, awesome people watching, and oh so many friends in attendance... what a blast!

I didn't take the time to see the Ansel Adams exhibition, so I will have to return to PAM again soon to do that.  I did, however, eat the following:

-Scallop with English Pea Risotto from Different Pointe of View
-Shrimp Ceviche from Chelsea's Kitchen
-Gazpacho from Arcadia Farms
-Posole from Green
-Ginger Sweet Potato Pudd'n from Breadfruit
-Lambchop with Farfalle and Savory Creme Brulee from Talavera
-Waloo Tataki in lettuce wrap and Grilled Chicken Meatball from Hana
-Machaca from Kai

Apparently, I missed a kick-ass Beef Wellington from Petite Maison as well as samples from a handful of other restaurants.  Jared made up for what I passed on, including a Crab Cake Slider from Relish and three-four extra servings of Cowboy Ciao's Frosted Flake Ice Cream & Brittle with Malted Oatmeal Cookie.  

Yes, I will definitely have to try to get in an extra workout or two this week to make up for all of those extra calories I ""devoured"" on Sunday.

Located SW of Las Vegas and across Desert Breeze park, its a nice small place that serves up gigantic boba/slushy drinks! Most of them are priced around $2.85 and are all full of flavor. Got the coconut and passionfruit slushy which came in a gigantic tub-like cup!

Also ordered the 6 skewer special which was okay tasting. I chose the chicken gizzard, chicken heart, pork, lamb, and ribeye. They could have added more seasoning onto the meat to get more flavor but eh. however, the meat was grilled to perfection and very chewy but honestly, you can't really get full on the skewers alone which is why you shouldn't come if you're super hungry. The garlic butter mussels are delish! but of course you can't get full on that either. The BeeGee's sizzling platter is probably the only thing that I got full on since it came with porkchop, beef, and chicken plus rice and the flavor was quite savory.

Pros: gigantic drinks!
tasty skewers

Cons: price for skewers (probably won't get full unless you order a lot)",2011-06-01 23:48:53

In contrast drink specials are great here as you can get shots on thu and fri for $2.99 and $3.99 on all other nights. They have unique drinks here like a drink that has cotton candy in it which was very interesting. You can also get mango Mexican Bulldogs for about $11. Drinks were the main attraction here. I'm almost tempted to say they should just rename the place to crazy cocktails and sell wings on the side. Because you should really only be there for the drinks!,2015-11-21 02:52:12

So I was pretty down when I heard that they were offering summerlicious (which is basically their AYCE dinner at a SLIGHTLY lower price...) the summerlicious price is $38+tax AND a mandatory 15% tip, so since we went on a Friday night, in the end we saved about $10.

The food was good, however I think they need to work more on coordinating their staff because the same 2-3 types of meat kept appearing at our table over and over, whereas other meats didn't and we had to send in requests. The pineapple was nice and sweet, but I wish there was more cinnamon on it! Since the other Brazilian Steak House I've been to had on-par quality meat, I would probably go there instead, since their service and ambiance is way better.

I asked the waitress near the end of the meal if I could see a copy of the menu so I can see what we didn't get to try yet, and she told me that its available online. However, not everyone has smart phones/data so I really think they should have had at least a few print-outs of the meat selection.
Also, the waitress was rushing us out which I didn't really like. We had a 8:30 reservation, and at 9:30 she was handing us the bill without us asking. (even though the table next to us came earlier than us and got their bill way later). And after the staff saw we had paid our bills, they kept asking us if we had any *final* requests for the kitchen, even though we were still in the middle of our meals! Then at 10:30, the waitress came by and told us we are ""lucky"" that there was a last minute reservation cancellation, so we can stay a bit longer.

While meandering about it was highly entertaining to hear the guy up front. He'd holler things like, ""Hey ___!"" What the FBOMB are you doing?"" (I can't remember the name of unfortunate soul in the back.) ""HEEEEEYYYYYY! Fbomb Fbomb Fbomb you better do this ___!""

The store offers very friendly priced snacks. You're not paying eight dollars here for crackers. Very convenient for a late night nibble should you be in search of one. (Cookies, ice cream, chips and so on.)

Excellent customer service and proud management.",2014-07-16 20:16:01

I was really impressed with the talent of the musicians and the acoustics in the Hall. I buy the cheapest seats on the orchestra level for about $19 per show, I don't believe there is a bad seat in the house. I like to attend some popular concerts as well as more technical pieces like Mahler. I was very impressed with the players execution of the piece.

I look forward to the next season as they reveal more of the upcoming program.

One word of caution, check if Comic-Con or something else at the convention center is going on before you drive down there. Parking may end up being more expensive than your ticket or hard to find. On those days, I recommend the Light Rail.",2018-06-10 20:19:22
QJ7yIaBH0baVYK8jnltEAw,toPx4EV7yhnMwWGoFVCDvw,cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA,3,0,0,0,"Yep, like most of the previous yelpers - I did grow up in Chicago and have had my fair share of deep dish pizza. Giordanos is not my first choice when it comes to deep dish but, a friend really wanted to try it so we were game. 
This is the first valley location and of course I was very skeptical they could make a true Chicago deep dish here in Phoenix.
Anyway, we had a large group and were seated outside on the patio. Drinks came slowly most of the night but, we were here for pizza so not a deal breaker.
I know deep dish takes time 45 minutes or so and since we ordered several pies I knew it would take longer. After an hour passed, the pizza made it to our tables and looked great. We ordered mushroom and sausage on one and pepperoni on another. Even got a thin crust for the kids.
Overall, the pizza was cheesy goodness. I would say very good but, the canned mushrooms were a bit rubbery and were a bummer. Sausage was great, pepperoni too. Even the thin pizza was tasty.
Service was steady and friendly but, a bit slow at times - especially drinks - may be that's the bartenders fault but, all we ordered was beer, wine or soda - nothing should take 15 minutes to get there when the place is half empty.
Yes, I would eat here again. It's a fair try at a Chicago classic but, there are better even in the valley. Personally, I like to get my deep dish fix when I visit chi-town in the summer.",2018-02-03 20:53:02

As a child I had a well meaning Aunt that subjected me to unspeakable cruelties. By this, I mean she was always making us watch these old movie musicals. To this day, I still cannot bear the thought of having to watch South Pacific, West Side Story or The Sound of Music EVER again!

But anyways..

A friend hooked me up with some free tickets to the show, so I figured I may as well check it out. After all, if it really stunk I would just walk on out. No big risk there, right?

I ended up enjoying this so much more than I ever would have thought!

The orchestra was incredible! The sound level was perfect, as well! Loud enough to be able to enjoy the performances comfortably, but not overbearing. I also greatly enjoyed the lighting and especially some of the costumes! Those costumes during the second ""Chicago"" number were fantastic!

Some of my favorite moments from the show included...

- the opening ""Cabaret"" was fantastic! Very fun number!
- the number with the baseball players was cheesy fun and really was a throwback to a different time and attitude lol
- ""A Chorus Line"" was great, as well! This was one of the few numbers I was already familiar with going in.
- The ""Chicago"" number with the ladies in the prison cells was both funny and sexy.
- This Randal Keith guy can flat out sing his butt off! That guy was pretty impressive! 

Actually, this entire show was impressive! The signing, the choreography, the production values....all just off the charts fantastic! 

All that being said, I don't think this is going to be a show that has widespread appeal, IMHO. I honestly wonder how long the show will last at the current price point. ($110-$165)

Plus, as other reviews have stated, they did start late on this showing as well. That can be a tad bit annoying when you've been sitting in your seat for a half hour in anticipation. 

Despite this, I did very much enjoy the show and the ""old school"" vibe about it. This is the type of show I would imagine they had on the strip back in the 60's and 70's...and that makes me smile.

On a side note: Is it just me or does anyone else see Brian and Stewie doing these numbers as well? lol

We were a large group that had every variety of eating habit.  The most notable one, gluten free. One of the greatest thing about this place is they offer another menu that is entirely gluten free. Wonderful!

The dishes have never blown me away. I do find for large groups it tends to give a good variety  for a reasonable price.  It's a great place for okay food and good service.  IN other words, when you have a large party and you have to have a Bellini, go here!

The place is quite large and simply decorated with an oriental rug and a number of decorative items on the walls.   We were attended to promptly for our drink order which for the most part was a nice tall glass of water with lemon.  One of us rebelled and ordered a chocolate-stout ""guinness"" type beer which came in a really tall glass.  Looked amazing and it was.  Ordered Chicken Samosas that came out crispy with an ample, delicious filling of ground chicken with peas. Nice middle eastern seasonings, but not overwhelming.  Nice start. 
Our orders were quite diverse:  Chicken kabob sandwich with seasoned rice; lamb kabob sandwich; Leg of Lamb kabob combo; Braised Lamb shank; Chicken Quorma.  I had the chicken kabob ""nanwich"" that was tasty, but the nan wrapping was too thick for my liking.  I moistened the sandwich with the coriander chutney which added a fresh, spicy taste. The seasoned rice that came with it was flavorful and nicely cooked.  Nothing worse than soggy rice but this one was cooked perfectly. The lamb Kabob sandwich was quite good and the spinach rice accompaniment got rave reviews from everyone who ordered it.  I tasted it and found that it had a hint of mint. Nice touch!  The lamb shank was a large portion, but we must remember that this lamb dish comes on a bone.  The person who ordered it was happy with his dish. The Chicken Quorma presented in a red sauce was enjoyed as well.  
We ordered two desserts, Pistachio ice cream and Baklava.  Who doesn't love Baklava?  The pistachio ice cream dish came topped generously with whipped cream.  And then, the moment happened,  I delved my spoon into that pistachio ice cream which was nothing short of nirvana.  OMG.  Pistachio ice cream drizzled with rose water laden with chopped pistachios.  YES, YES. Pistachios in pistachio ice cream!  When was the last time that happened?  I mean LOTS of pistachios, not a sprinkling here and there.  Yes, Rania's ---you got me! You got me good.  I LOVED this dessert.  Then there was the Baklava--large, full of nuts and made with honey.  Yes.  I could taste the honey (not the corn syrup that most places make it with).  Another taste thrill.  Nicely done, Rania's you gave a us delightful conclusion to an overall wonderful meal experience.  
Met the owner, Wally, at the tail end of our visit when we had the opportunity to chat. Such a friendly and charming individual.  It makes a difference when the owner is hands-on and is able to chat up his customers.  The tasty food and the cordiality of the owner will make me come back over and over again.

They have pretty decent AYCE sushi. most definitely not a 3 star place, but not a 5 star either. The only thing that would have made it 5 star if the red tuna (ahi) wasn't sliced paper thin, If it wasn't, this place would get a five star. 

This place is a great find for the AYCE (all you can eat) sushi lovers out there. The restaurant has a great selection for dinner when i went and the price is pretty decent as well. The sushi was all really good and they don't try and fill you up with a whole bunch of rice. The wait staff was always prompt and nice to me. The place was spacious and clean.

I've wracked my brains for a fitting analogy and that's the closest I can come. (Pun intended.) 

Today I had lunch here with a friend. Between the two of us, we had two rolls of tuna and salmon nigiri, a large bowl of miso soup, a salad, the most beautifully prepared grilled black cod glazed with some special exotic sauce I've ever tasted in my life, and a beef stir fry to top it all off. We basically stuffed our fat faces full of mind-blowing, top notch Japanese cooking, and what did the total bill come to? 39 stinking bucks, before tip. 

That, folks, is obscene. It's a gross violation of any community's decency standards. It's so good you'll need to keep looking around to make sure no one's watching as you indulge.

Recommend:
Peanut like flavored curry with chicken.  

NOT Recommended:
* I was not a fan of the papaya salad, it was overly drenched with prominent fish sauce and it seemed as though the salad may have been sitting out for a long while. Typically fresh Thai papya salad is firm, crisp...this lacked that.  

* The Pad See Ew: noodle dish that has a charred sauce flavor was lacking in the sauce and the garnishment of peanuts.  I had the beef and it was dry, tough and had hard sinew. It was not at all appetizing and the noodles typically with this dish is a rice noodle that is flat, long, wide and absorbs and retains the sauce. This noodle was cut up in like 1 inch or less lengths, it did the opposite affect.

* Rice with the order was also underdone.

I had back-to-back experiences with this place that were not the greatest, not in terms of my own satisfaction but in terms of how a business is run.  Let me start with the first one that was a take out experience.  We had a small get-together to watch a Steeler's game and we thought of ordering from Atria's.  Since their wraps are amazing, most of us (6 in number) wanted to order a wrap.  However, when we called they told us that the tortillas were over and they could not serve us the wrap (weird for a restaurant to be out of tortillas in the afternoon).  Then some of us changed the order to salads and some to other items, one of which was a turkey club.  After a while, the phone rings and it was Atria's to let us know that they did not have enough turkey to make the club, so we had to order something else! This was another bummer right there.  When we got the food everything was fine but still all this made the whole experience a bit bitter.  

One week later, we decided to give it another try, this time dining in the restaurant.  The atmosphere and the place is really nice and enjoyable.  Everything on the menu seemed nice and the stuff was helpful for sure.  In terms of food, the new item on the menu, the baked ziti is phenomenal, and the pork fillet gorgonzola is great as well! However, again there were some small stuff that made the whole experience a bit weird.  For example, again one of the orders could not be accomplished since some ingredient was again missing! Also, when the burger that I had ordered came in it came without the side! When the waitress served the burger she did not mention anything about it so we had to ask her about them. Of course they served the side as well later, but I would have expected the stuff to be proactive and mention that there will be a small delay in the side due to some reason.  

I really wish I could give a better rating to this place, but both the experiences I had,  had some flags with regards to the way this business is run.",2013-11-18 22:06:51

And judging from the crowd that showed up on a rainy Sunday evening, it's working. The diners were a mixed bunch: lots of families with their kids, lots of singles at the community table. 

     Chef Justin Beckett, formerly of Canal, his wife and some friends took over the space previously occupied by That's Italiano, a restaurant that deserved to close. They did a lovely renovation, with exposed wood beams, an open kitchen, lots of windows, and the above mentioned community table, made from a fallen black walnut tree. To put you in a good mood there's a number of specialty cocktails, a nice wine list, and 4 draught beers, plus others by the bottle. Our server, Allison, was delightful - very funny, but also very professional. 

     The menu isn't large, but it was hard to make a selection since everything sounds good. An interesting appetizer entry is Beckett's Original Grilled Cheese served with  roasted red pepper tomato soup ($9). Creamy Grits & Spicy Andouille Sausage ($8) was tempting. Ken opted to get two appetizers for his meal, the Chef's Country Pate ($8) and those scary Roasted Brussels Sprouts with pancetta, shaved manchego cheese and lemon thyme vinaigrette ($6). I thought it strange that this was considered an appetizer. For me, the Crisp Butter Lettuce Salad, green grapes, toasted pecans, candied lemon vinaigrette ($6) and a side of Mac and Cheese ($5, as are all the side dishes including the bacon cheddar biscuits which we ordered while trying to decide on the rest of our meal). Our friend Sena decided, after much pondering, on the pork osso bucco ($17). And Leon ordered his usual hamburger - in this case the ""B""  Burger with Buttered Brioche, Boursin, Bib lettuce, Beefsteak tomato ($13).

     So how was it? The biscuits, which arrived first were a good omen. They were more scone-like than biscuity, but they were delicious, especially with the accompanying apple honey butter. Ken enjoyed his pate, which came with lots of things to eat with it, including peanut brittle. Sena's osso bucco was delicious, tender and rich. The only problem was that the carrots served in the roasted vegetable medley were terribly undercooked. The same was true, to a lesser extent, of the brussels sprouts plus they were pretty much tasteless. The vinaigrette on my salad was outstanding, but the grapes and pecans were in short supply. Leon said his burger was just okay, but he seems to feel that way about most of the burgers he orders. One day we'll find him one that will knock his socks off! If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know.

     The entrees didn't live up to the biscuits, but I had high hopes for dessert ($5 each). There's a strange one - Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'Mores with caramel, housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter, and graham crackers. But I had to go with the Fig & Pecan Pie which came with cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream. This was delectable, rich but not too sweet. I usually don't like cream cheese ice cream, but this was a perfect match for the pie and the citrus zest just sung out. Loved it. Ken grumbled a little about the poor selection of tea, and the fact that there was no espresso.

     All things considered, despite the negatives, I'd go back. I have the feeling that things will get better and better.

The food is either bland, cold, or stale. Service is ah-okay. I feel bad for the tourists that come here and pays $30 to eat here. It's not really worth it.

I had taken a trip with my two other sisters to Pacific Mall and after a filling lunch, decided to get ourselves some dessert. I remembered seeing Dolce 21 on Instagram and offered to try this place out.

Service was great, very friendly ladies behind the counter who were very knowledgeable about their menu, and answered any questions with a smile. That's always appreciated! 

Of course my sisters and I had to order the most posted food item on Instagram, and I can't recall the name of it. But it's a soft serve with a few other toppings, topped up super high with in house lychee cotton candy.

First looking at it, it's of course very, very aesthetically pleasing and different from other things you would normally get from any dessert place. I had ordered mine with both vanilla and matcha swirl, but you can't really tell since that strong bright colour of the blue vanilla really stood out. 

To break it down, the bottom layer was of candy popcorn. I'm really, really not a big fan of candy popcorn so I had only tried one and left the rest. Then above the popcorn you have their soft serve which was a real treat! Perfect sweetness and texture, and that funky blue colour really makes you wonder. The ice cream is then topped with some decorative sprinkles, not much to say on that. Then it was topped up high with their lychee cotton candy. I'm a little bittersweet on the lychee cotton candy as from first bite, the first reaction I had was a SUPER sour punch in the face, then came the lychee flavour and sweetness rolling in. And as an extra, there was this what I can only describe as a Nutella tasting wafer roll stuck in.

I enjoyed the dessert as a whole, but for sure it's something to be shared as there's a lot more offered than meets the eye. Next time around I would so order the same soft serve but I don't think I'll be getting the cotton candy option again as there was just A LOT of it and ended up plopping it right off my ice cream and placing it on a napkin just so I could get to my soft serve before it melted. I also do want to try a few of their drink options. 

I highly recommend Dolce 21 if you're looking for a cute dessert pic for your Instagram! And also as a treat to yourself!",2016-02-14 22:29:56

Started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes topped with a too-tart red pepper, feta and corn chutney. 

Next was the Avocado in Jicama - pureed avocado that's perfectly seasoned and sprinkled with fried tortilla bits in a Tostitos Scoops like jicama.  Delicious!

For our daily veggie intake we opted for the Kale Salad with toasted pine nuts, raisins, Ricotta Salata. This was topped with a fried quail egg that could've used some seasoning. The salad overall was enjoyable.

For our main we shared the Paella del Carmen - scallops, clams, mussels, shrimp, chicken and chorizo. No regrets here! Loved scraping up the rice crust from the bottom of the pan and the chicken and sausage fats really flavored the dish nicely.  The seafood was cooked perfectly - not one thing was overcooked.

I was only at Fish Creek for a few hours on a Summer day as a tourist and only explored the trails near the Bow Valley Ranch visitor center.  Visitor Center was closed on Sunday.  The trails in this area are pretty tame, and there are plenty of bicyclists and local residents out for a walk.  It's mostly flatland.   Vegetation includes ponds, creeks and some scattered wooded areas.  There are suburban residential areas immediately surrounding the park and a few trails lead directly into people's backyards.  In the wooded area, there was a mini-trail we walked thru.  Trail was completely shaded and surrounded by dense amount of trees.  A cool breeze came thru and there were falling leaves all around us.  It was an interesting experience.   

As an international tourist, time is especially valuable.  Is it worth it spending a few hrs here vs spending that same additional time in Banff or the Three Sisters area?  Hindsight probably I'd go with a few more hrs in Banff.  Nonetheless, if you have a extra hrs in Calgary unplanned, this is a good stop. Parking is free.",2011-10-29 20:39:41

Not really sure what I was getting into, since I'm not use to going to Irish Pubs. But it was St. Patty's Day and the wife thought it would be nice to go out and do something Irish for once. 

Located in North Las Vegas, on North 5th Street and Deer Springs. Morrissey's Irish Pub seems to be a very well built building. My first thoughts were, a bar with some booth inside. But surprisingly it was built, where the bar is separate from the dining room. I thought it was kind of clever, since not many people would like to be seated next to a bar and eat. It makes for a quiet dining experience for those who just want to dine and a separate room for those who just want a place to drink. 

Focusing on the dining room itself. Its kind of a small, but just enough room to have booths and tables. It is roomy and the color scheme seems interesting. It is a nice place, and I like how their booth is separated by tall walls, so you don't have that feeling of some one watching you eat. 

My experience, and sharing it with the wife on St. Patrick's Day, was kind of very nice. The host greeted us, as well as our waiter.  The staff overall, was very pleasant. Since its a special day, they had a special menu. $8.95 for appetizers and $15.95 for entrees. At first, it looked a bit pricey, but sure enough, you get what you get paid for. We had mozzarella sticks to start with, and they were a bit bigger then your usual mozzarella sticks. We also order Shepard's pie, which came with salad. The salad was in a big portion, and the Shepard's Pie was a decent size as well. I like the fact that it was in a bread bowl, covered with mash potatoes. I did my best to finish my salad and pie. I got to the point of eating my bread bowl. Unfortunately I only got halfway done. I ate everything else, except for my veggies, but over all, it was delicious.  The wife decided to take home her Shepard's Pie, but, I ended up eating that the next day.

Hotel lounge style environment with comfortable seating are the good things about this restaurant, but the rest goes downhill from there.

A couple examples: 

Their siu mai dumplings were lacking in flavour and did not come out steaming hot as you would expect if it were in a traditional steamer. They were accompanied with some breaded scallops that were cold, soggy and overly salty from the sauce it was covered in. 

Their egg tarts had this stiff texture on the flakes of the crust that felt like it had been left standing for a while and reheated before it was brought out. The birds nest and pomelo added no value to the overall taste.

This place tries to present themselves as an upscale restaurant serving up dim sum with a bit of modern flare but definitely failed on execution and overall food quality was subpar.

BrTIkjE_uOFXnrDeSTgrpg,VLXs-wsFTNclmMPCm3A6EA,poSV39UqEg-gpESXafS9-g,1,0,0,0,"My fiancé and I went to Angry Crab Shack & BBQ for lunch as we frequently do. I usually wait until I have an extraordinary experience before writing a review somewhere. This means I have usually visited a location multiple times before writing and can give an accurate depiction of the business I am reviewing. This is one of those times and unfortunately it was an extraordinarily bad experience. We decided we wanted crawfish for lunch. Anytime we go to Angry Crab I always get crawfish and my fiancé will revolve through the different menu items each time we go. Before choosing where to eat, we called Angry Crab to check the current price of fresh crawfish at which time we also asked how busy they were. The woman who answered gave the prices for both fresh and frozen crawfish as well as told us that they were at about half capacity so there wouldn't likely be a wait when we arrived. We came in about 20 minutes later and were seated by a nice waitress who quickly asked for our drink order and since we already knew what we wanted we asked to order our food too. After telling her we wanted crawfish she informed us that they had been out of fresh crawfish for months and had discontinued carrying frozen crawfish. We told her that the woman who answered the phone failed to mention that when we had called and she apologized and left us to decide if we wanted to go somewhere else. We decided to stay and asked if we could get a discount on crab because we actually wanted crawfish which also happens to be the cheapest thing on the menu. She said she would have to ask her manager and left. We sat and waited for about 15 minutes before my fiancé became frustrated and flagged down the manager himself. The manager came over (who looked rather unprofessional with dirty clothes, messy hair and unshaven face that screamed ""I don't care"") and the waitress had not even told him of the issue yet. We explained the situation and let him know what we were asking for. The only thing on the menu I really enjoy as much as crawfish is king crab legs. The cost for the fresh crawfish they didn't have was $12/lb and the cost of king crab legs was $30/lb. Obviously the manager was not going to give king crab at crawfish price so my fiancé asked for a compromise; king crab for snow crab price. Snow crab was $21/lb which would have been a $9 discount, I would have been happy with my dinner and we would have felt like we were compensated for the lack of communication on the phone call before we came in. The manager seemed baffled that we would ask such a thing of him, apologized (insincerely) to my fiancé about 5 times and offered to buy him a beer (which was on happy hour special for around $2.50). The discount was not about the money. We could pay $30 for a crab leg lunch. Its about customer service. If you mess up you make the customer feel like they were compensated for the inconvenience you caused. I have worked in customer service long enough to know that. We declined the beer and I was more upset than I would have been had we just ordered the king crab without asking for a discount. I was honestly really irritated that I was the one inconvenienced by them being out of what I wanted to eat and he offered to buy by fiancé a beer. Where is my offer? Where is my apology? Why didn't he ask me what he could do to make me happy? He really didn't even acknowledge me when I spoke which is why my fiancé did all the talking. I'm guessing he assumed my fiancé was the one paying so he was the one to please which is somewhat offensive because we make the same amount and share expenses 50/50. My fiancé ordered mussels and I ended up ordering shrimp which was a few dollars more than the crawfish would have been and I did not enjoy it as much. The manager brought us our bill and had taken 20% off which ended up amounting to about a $9 savings which is frustrating because if he had agreed to just taking the $9 off the crab in the first place I would have ordered it and gotten what I wanted, we would have spent more overall, it would have made us feel like the customer service was great which would have caused return business and a good review. Instead he ended up giving us the same amount of money off, we spent less than we would have if I had purchased crab and we left unhappy causing no return business from us and a bad review.

Edit: 
So I think I owe it to the fantastic guys at Roast to expand on my review and explain exactly why this place is going to do so well.  In no particular order, here's what makes Roast a fantastic addition to State Street.

1. The Ingredients
Apparently, most of the stuff is locally sourced.  Personally, I don't care if they fly it in by zeppelin from Timbuktu, the important thing is that the food they are serving is fresh and high quality.  And the bread... oh, God, the bread.  Let's just say it's good.

2. The Sandwiches
Every single sandwich is brilliantly designed on a conceptual level.  They're all based on traditional favorites, but most have a slight twist that really brings it home.  All the ingredients make sense; none is randomly chosen.    And where lesser restauranteurs might slap all their sandwiches on the same roll, that's not the case here.  Each is perfectly paired with the right bread for the job.  

Also, I have to mention the absolutely ingenious decision to include a layer of lightly friend cheddar mashed potatoes on the turkey with cranberry-jalapeno relish special last week.  Brilliant!

3. The atmosphere. 
They've really done a nice job reshaping the Buffalo Wild WIngs Space.  It's more open than it has been, the color schemes are great, and the whole space is inviting.  Definitely check out the basement (you might not even realize it's there)-- it's a really fantastic lounge area with a ping-pong table.  It's awesome.

4. The service 
It's incredibly consistent, especially for such a new place.  I stopped in last week and the place was packed with drunken undergrads and yet I still managed to get in and out in a few minutes with my takeout order.

5. The Owners
These guys really deserve a round of applause.  They're all young guys, they're all taking a big risk, and they are all working their butts off. To top it off, they're all incredibly nice and sincere.   These guys aren't playing at being restauranteurs-- they've thought long and hard, come up with a really great concept, and are doing everything they possibly could to make it succeed.  State Street is lined with restaurants that are poorly conceived, poorly-run, badly-valued etc. etc. and yet somehow still manage to stay open.  WIth the addition of Roast, the bar has truly risen.

Thanks for bringing your incredible work to Madison, guys.  I really think you're going to make a well-deserved mint off this place.",2012-10-10 05:30:36

I wasn't really amazed by any of them. The steak seemed to lack flavor, but the avocado aioli was great. The pork belly was dry and there was not enough flavor for me. The only one that I enjoyed was the stuffed jalapeno pepper with shrimp. The slaw was flavorful. And the stuffed jalapeno part was good and cheesy.

Los platos son muy originales y sabrosos como los calamares con trufas de verano (13$), buena combinacion, tambien nos encantó, el jamón de pato con las cacahuates y apio (10$), pero me gusto mas, el lechón con las papas (14$), delicioso. Hemos tomado un vino orgánico, el Hurluberlu, St-Nicolas de Bourgeuil 2013 (46$). Los precios son baratos para este tipo de comida. El servicio del los chefs era muy bien.

Although they'd recently remodeled and added a couple of giant screen, leather seat XD Cinemas, the regular auditoriums are very dated. Yes, they are stadium seating but the seats are old and very uncomfortable. Want to see a movie in one of the nice new auditoriums? Yep, that'll cost you some extra cash. 

The clientele at this theater is usually a bit ""lower quality"" than at other movie theaters in town. Expect loads of screaming babies in R-rated films and lots of talking obnoxious teenagers and folks being of the type where you wouldn't want to even LOOK at them cross-eyed answering their cell phones during the movie. I have never had a pleasant experience here. There's even a big ad that runs before the movie saying that if you text on your phone or talk during the movie that they'll kick you out. That's a big lie. I have had to get up several times during movies to go alert an employee and while they will come in the theater and stand around for a few minutes, I have NEVER ONCE seen them ask anybody leave -- even when the offenders were talking right in front of them. 

The absolute worst thing I have ever experienced was a few months ago when I went to see an animated movie. There was a (loud, talking) family behind me in the theater. During the movie, their baby started crying (of course) and they didn't take him out, they just sat in the movie while their kid wailed and wailed. Suddenly, I started to smell poop. It got stronger. Thankfully the movie was almost over. As soon as it ended, they walked out and I STILL smelled poop. I turned around to look and the mom had CHANGED HER BABY'S DIAPER DURING THE MOVIE and had LEFT THE POOP FILLED DIAPER STUFFED INTO THE ARMREST ON THE MOVIE SEAT. This will tell you the ""quality"" of the customers at this place. 

I try not to go to this theater unless I have to because management doesn't seem to care about the rude behavior of their audiences.",2013-12-10 20:57:04

Customization: less ice, less sugar, etc.

Had: Medium (they don't have a small size) brown rice with less ice and mini pearls/small boba. Total cost was $5.10. Tastes delicious. Nice and creamy. Strong brown rice taste. Mini pearls are delightful. Still chewy, not soggy, but also completely cooked through.

It's also quite difficult for them to get your order wrong because your order is printed onto a sticker they place on your cup.

While this is branded as an Arts Festival, it could also be called a music festival.  There are hundreds of artists selling their wares, but there are also four stages packed with entertainment.  The music choices range from blue grass to hip hop, folk to rock and roll and it is almost non stop between the different stages.  

A lot of the artwork is out of most people's budgets, but there is a nice mix of art that you can purchase for under $50 as well.  The range of items for sale is typical of most art festivals - paintings, photography, pottery and jewelry.  One of the more unique (and affordable) vendors was the chinese paper cutter.  For $1 per letter, he cut your name and your name in Chinese out of paper and included a mat!  It was an affordable and very unique gift.  

There is also a great variety of food.  Everything from traditional cotton candy and corn dogs to lobster burgers.  I sampled the lobster burger and it was very tasty.  Like any festival, though, the food can be pricey.  

One of the nice features of the festival is that there are several free water stations around.  the day I was there it was sunny and in the 80s, so this was a life saver.

A handful of us stopped in for Happy Hour. With mixed drinks at $7 during HH, I had the bartender pour me ""Something with Hendricks, but not too sweet."" It was Christmas time after all and what a better drink than something that tastes like a Christmas Tree? I left the specifics up to them, I figured they'd know better what to mix together than I would. I ended up with something with lemon and mint, and pretty tasty at that! 

After everyone arrived, we all ordered the $5 pork Ramen from the HH menu as well as the Asian chicken wings, both items delish, and both items worth coming back for during HH.

Sangria-Delicious
Mojitos-Same
Seviche (spelled that way) -Ditto
Gambas y Pollo-See Above
Pumpkin Soup (seasonal)-Best I've Had

The bad - I think they are pretty over-priced for Cuban food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but I don't think Cuban food should fall in the $20/plate range.  You need a key to get into the restrooms, which makes it feel kind of like a gas station.  You also get a feel that most male customers just go behind the dumpsters, not that I did that...  

This place would have been an easy 5-stars except for one thing, that totally blew the experience.  The waiter automatically added a 20% tip to the bill, on top of tax.  Ordinarily he would have earned it.  But when questioned, he said they always do that on large parties.  We were a party of 5.  He was extremely arrogant about it, saying nobody's ever questioned it.  Totally ruined the whole evening.  And of course, there was no mention of an auto-tip on the menu, go figure.

They offer a special on the cheese burger and fries for $4.99. It was 1/4 pound burger cooked to order and offer 4 different choices of cheese.

There's really not a bad seat in the house since it's not that large of an arena and I've been satisfied sitting on both the lower and upper levels. It really depends on how the stage is set up. Sound quality is ok...if you're here for a concert, sometimes the music can be so loud that you can't hear the lyrics unless the performer is shouting into the mic.

The staff and ushers are generally pretty helpful and security isn't too much of a hassle. Concession prices are pretty standard and a rip off like any other arena, although beers aren't too bad @ $8.50 each. My only gripe is that there is only one exit so it takes forever to get out of the arena after an event is over!

Great portion size of two fried catfish fillets with a waffle. The fillets were real good - not greasy, not too salty, breading was on point and the catfish was tasty. Waffle was pretty standard with the butter and syrup.

As with any new opening, timing was off as it took a little bit longer than expected to get the food to the table, even though it was not that busy on a Thursday evening.

On the positive: If you have been privy to see many shows in NYC, both on and off broadway, this show compares as average. It was fun. Very colorful, great music and singing and dancing. Three story lines: Moulin Rouge, Romeo and Juliet, and Great Gatsby love stories are all portrayed. The stories never really connected and did not emote any emotion from me as way too much going on almost all the time.
On the not so great: The problem with the show is the seating. We sat at a table and were sorely disappointed. The seating lacks logic. There are two tables on the stage, on each side, one table just behind each of those, and then the rest of the tables are on the floor, which can obstruct quite a bit of your view if you are sitting toward the sides of the theater, so you have to be in the center of the seating if sitting at table. The show does not just happen on stage, yet also behind the tables in front of the regular seats. As for the tables, the alcohol is grossly overpriced and the choices of beverages are not of the best quality. 
Overall, I found the day that I went, the show was a glorified high school play at an arts academy, where one female singer had a louder and stronger voice than the other and this was a competition. There must of been friends or 'groupies' in the audience as they were cheering every time two of the main girls sang like the messiah came to town... just tacky!!!

I think it's decently priced for lunch and a much better alternative to some of the (relatively) more popular places to eat for brunch (*ahem Mon Ami Gabi). 

I LOVE mussels, and the ones I had in Bouchon in LA were some of the best I've had. Thankfully, the one in Vegas remains the same. It's a huge portion size that makes the $25.50 price tag very worth it. My trick is to first eat the ones that allow me to dig a little hole and reach the white wine with saffron sauce. Then I can eat my mussels AND dip my french fries into the sauce at the same time! Pure deliciousness. :)

I tried some of the croque madame and smoked salmon baguette which were both outstanding. A friend also ordered the special of the day which was a pork belly BLT. Service was a little slow, but we had a large group and I didn't mind that much. I was amazed at how identical the Vegas Bouchon and LA Bouchon looked. Uncanny!

I really think this is the best Sunday brunch you'll find on the strip, granted you're looking for a French style brunch and not a buffet. The prices are probably a little more expensive, but the food is so, so much better!",2011-08-28 09:49:17

First , upon entry I noticed the very loud tv blaring a Vietnamese show. In addition to that noise were some employees on a lunch break talking very loud to the working employee. I still thought I'll see if the food was any good..
It took a while to get my order in as the waitress was busy socializing with her fellow co workers. Ummm, not okay.
I ordered vegan potstickers (which came out with mayo all over them), sent them back to get another order which was dry outside and greasy inside, and the silver noodle salad. The salad was decent, but not worth the high volume noise of

I thought it was a fun and a unique experience in that way. I liked that the all you can eat sushi included desserts and appetizers for 60min. The menu is hard to navigate for a Sushi Simpleton like me . I don't order any sushi that has raw fish in it ..I mainly stick to the rolls with the fake crab .

We tried the Snow Crab roll (limit 2 per customer) ...thank goodness there was a limit! It was hard for me to eat it because it just didn't taste good.

I mean they give you French fries instead of bread- what's not to like? That being said I would say my experience at the Vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in DC or SF but I am a Niles Crane-esque nitpicker so don't let that deter you. Also, Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the Border Grill brunch). There are like 3 negative reviews where the people say "" I can make food better than this""- I'm not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. 


The Steak

I always get a bone in ribeye when I first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. The ribeye here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and I actually think the meat was a little tastier. The steak had been trimmed a little more than I would like (fat= flavor) but it didn't seem to have negatively affected the steak. The curst was nice and salty- good. Medium rare was a deep red-good. The price (59$) is pretty average for Vegas steak joints on the strip. My dining companion got the Waygu  vs Waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what I will get the next time I go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) 

The Sides

Some people, after eating 2 lbs of French fries, might think ""You know what; I probably don't need another potato side"". We call those people losers. The reason these underhumans won't be dining with me is because Stripsteak has a little something called the Potato Puree Trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. Perhaps I am a philistine but the lobster potatoes were actually freaking awesome. I know it probably shouldn't be done, I know it's probably not the choicest lobster bits but jesus... it is good. 

The mac and cheese- I also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. It was quite ""crusty"" with lots of bits on top which I like. The mac itself was perhaps a little dry but I would rather that than have it swimming. 

Broccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good.",2014-04-03 17:33:37

It is located on the ground floor of a tall glass and steel residential building, with an outdoor covered patio. The section that we sat in has mostly booths, with some tables and chairs along the wall, and a full bar with seating near the front door. There was a tv near our table (which required me to explain the finer points of Indy car racing) and two more at the bar, and there was music playing not too loudly in the background. It was not very busy at the time, so the service was pretty quick.

The menu is the same as for the other Fran's locations: all-day breakfast, sandwiches, salads, burgers, desserts. I ordered the Morning Glory, which is one large waffle with eggs and bacon and caramelized apples, and a strawberry float. My friend had the Eggs Blackstone, which is Eggs Benedict with salmon instead of peameal bacon, and a cup of herbal tea.

The dutch baby, though it is big, is really like a crepe minus the filling... that's why the topping ratio is relevant. 

There were only a a few pieces of apple (maybe a quarter of a cup) and the caramel, I was told by our server, gets mixed in when they are being warmed -- rendering it hardly evident. 

Fortunately, our server offered to bring a side of the caramel, which was more than enough and definitely improved the overall dish.  

I liked the coffee cup better than the coffee... but it was drinkable.

There was a wait (10AM on a Saturday morning) without a lot of indoor waiting space. It was drizzly, so the patio was closed. Don't know that there would've been a wait at that time if the patio had been open.

One large room with about 20 tables, you order and pick up the food at a counter.  Besides your standard, tacos, burritos, tostadas, etc, they had a slew of items that sounded good, but i'll be damned if i knew what they were.

the standard street cart taco ( a couple soft tortillas, meat, onion, cilantro and various sauces from the salsa bar cost 85 cents.  Given my pathetic limitations of low carb, i basically ordered 4 carnitas tacos minus the tortillas , placed in a bowl - very good, yeah, kinda dull, but it hit the spot.

others had the tacos, cuille relleno, gorditas ( i just thought that was a taco bell thing ) tamales and some sort of stew made with pork rinds - it all looked great and everyone was pleased.

the lunch crowd was hopping - that's always nice to see in a local mom & pop restaurant.

Being on a strict nutrition plan, its important to me that I eat well.
Sometimes, though, you just want something sweet that isn't going to kill your diet.  Enter the Frozen Yogurt establishment. 

I've been craving froyo for over a week.  Saturday morning, I decided, I was going to hit up a froyo place after cashing my check...only to my dismay, the didn't open for another half hour, and I had other things to do.

So...my fella, being the kind, wonderful guy that he is (or, perhaps, fearing for his life if I did NOT get my froyo fix) says to me, ""We'll leave early tonight and hit a frozen yogurt place before karaoke.""  

When we got in the car, he asked me to pull up my trusty Yelp app to see if there is a place on the way to where we were going, and TADA!  Tops and Bottoms!

We'd passed by here a million times, and every time, we both say ""We should go there.""    This time we did. 

We walked in, and the place was very clean, bright and open.  Only a handful of customers were there, already enjoying their frozen treats.  

The Sea Salt Caramel pretzel caught my eye, and it was all over...I pretty much glazed over what other flavors they had, and they did have a few...but this sounded like heaven, and it tasted even better.

They had a selection of nuts, and cookie bites at the front of the line where you pick up your cups, and a selection of popping fruity chews, fresh fruit, chocolate pieces, and different sauces right before you weigh and pay. 

The young man who was working was very polite, offering us tasting cups, and explaining their rewards program (which I *obviously* signed up for).

We paid about $5 for two cups of yogurt.  That's pretty cheap!  I like the fact that you can decide how much yogurt you want here.  Some place (ice cream/shaved snow) give such ridiculously huge portions...this way I can choose to have a little or a lot!

I NEVER waited for more than a couple of minutes before the tech took me back. My appointments were quick and enjoyable. The staff is considerate, kind, efficient, and fun to chat with.  I always looked forward to visiting. :) 

A couple of weeks ago, Dr. Beecroft said I was good to go. No more PT, no more visits.  It was truly sad to say good-bye to the staff. They are the best.  I will CERTAINLy go back when my feet ail me again.",2013-01-06 19:12:31

Staff: Super friendly and top notch for service. They missed one of my orders but were very apologetic about it and whipped it up right away when they realized their mistake. They were constantly checking in and providing refills of side dishes.

Ambience: It's a small place with small tables. We were a party of 5 so they gave an extra stool for us to place more food because there was such little space. But it wasn't too bad. The stools themselves double as storage for any purses and bags (just lift off the seat!).

Food: We had the Assorted Platter of Pork and tried their Beef Skirt Meat and Janchi Guksu (Warm Noodle Soup) as well. We liked it enough that we ordered the same three dishes twice.

I ordered the chicken and waffles due to the positive reviews that I saw on Yelp however I was very disappointed in the portion size that I received. 4 small nuggets of dry, fried chicken was not what I had in mind (unfortunately I do not have a picture). The chicken wasn't terrible but was overlooked and dry. My meal was accompanied with a small cup of maple syrup and sour cream. The sour cream actually worked and was absolutely necessary to compliment the dryness of the chicken. They provided a small amount of maple syrup which was barely enough to moisten the waffle. When I asked for more syrup the waitress brought over another cup which was absolutely necessary for aforementioned chicken however she neglected to mention that it costs an extra $1.50 for syrup! She comped it at the end of the meal when we complained but the fact that they don't provide more syrup for a large waffle and fried chicken is disappointing. 

Others at the table ordered steak and eggs, eggs and toast and two eggs benedicts. The hash browns were very crispy and well seasoned. For the eggs benedicts the server asked how they wanted their eggs prepared and my fiancée requested 'soft' however received poached eggs that were cooked solid. Runny eggs are a rather key element for eggs benedict however it wasn't a deal-breaker so we didn't send it back.

It seems they've listened to the comments here on Yelp as all burgers are now larger than they used to be and also come with chips. 

Meaning that I, a hungry chick with plenty of belly room, ended up leaving several bites of burger on my plate, and the chips - while light and tasty - went mostly untouched in favor of the sweet potato fries and Double Helix fries on the side. I know people were complaining here about not getting the artisan fries included with their burgers, but that's a boggle. This isn't a diner, folks, and prices are low enough to encourage ordering a $4 side of fries. 

But now everyone can be happy, so come on back, ye grumpy little Yelpsters, and please give B+B another go. (My prodding here is entirely selfish; I don't want to lose the best vegetarian burger in Las Vegas.)

This time I tried a different salad (the one with bleu cheese and mandarin) and it was every bit as subtle yet flavorful as the ""Pear""fection salad I had last time. As my husband suggested to the waiter, it would be good if they offered half-salads (even if not for half-price) because the salads are almost a full meal. Now that the burgers are bigger and include chips, I would have to rethink the salad next time or else be more wasteful than I'd like, and it would be a shame to miss out on the salad.

What I didn't try was the old-fashioned sodas, which is odd because normally I'm all about notching new soft drinks. I think I avoided it because, in the photos on the table, the ""special"" sodas look like nothing more than bottles of Jones Soda knockoffs. I like Jones, but it's not amazing. Besides, when I hear the term ""old-fashioned soda,"" I'm thinking of hand-pulled egg creams and lime rickeys. But I guess they call it BOTTLES+Burgers for a reason.

Still, if they're taking suggestions, it would be great if B+B became sort of like the restaurant version of Rocket Fizz, selling a wide variety of lesser-known (or less-available) drinks. Surely the valley's many soda fiends would love to be able to go out to eat and get something more exotic than a Jarritos or IBC. (Locally made Joe's Cola, with that hint of honey taste, or Fresh Ginger Ale, with the pulpy ginger bits, would be my top choices.)

I wouldn't mind more non-alcoholic milkshake options, either. I'm sure the standard choc/van/straw offerings are tasty given the quality of the rest of the fare (there is a daily special, but on today's visit it was just double chocolate), but I still dream of BLT's Nut Job milkshake, and I loathe BLT in every other way. Not to get greedy, but if B+B had even a fraction of Cheeburger Cheeburger's shake/malt (malt!) selection, I wonder if I'd still be able to just walk in and get a table without a wait. Summer is coming. A more inventive shake (or malt!) selection for all ages would be a great break from the oppressive heat.

But again, this is a great restaurant, casual for any time of group yet aesthetically pleasing and creative. The servers are friendly; the owner often checks up on tables to make sure all is well; their social marketing presence is useful and personal, and the food is just screaming tasty.",2012-05-30 01:42:10

That being said, during my recent move, we decided to hire a moving company for the first time in my life.

I called some of the top rated movers on Yelp (One of which didn't bother to call me back), and decided to go with Budget Movers. 

The pricing was straight forward and affordable. The owner (Jim) also gave me an estimated amount of time he thought it would take to complete the move based on the information I gave him on the phone. He was spot on by the way. He estimated 4-5 hours and it ended up being exactly 4 hours from start to finish. 

The day of the move, they were running a little late, but Jim communicated with me the entire time to let me know what was going on. They only ended up being about 30 min late. It turned out one of the guys scheduled to do the move called out of work. 

Jim actually ended up helping with the move himself to make up for it, which I thought was cool. I think it's great when an owner is willing to get dirty in order to make things happen for their customer. 

Overall, it was an excellent experience. Jim and Joe were both very friendly which I didn't expect from movers. I guess I had some preconceived idea that they would be giant, grunting goons. Although they were sizeable gents, they were very pleasant and conversational. 

I'll never be a fan of the moving process, but at least now with Budget Movers, I know it doesn't have to be the hell I've experienced in the past. And now I can use my saved strength for more important tasks, like eating ice cream.",2014-08-12 20:30:57

Came in to order a #10 Cured Pork & Pork Sandwich, typically most Banh Mi's come with slices of Jalapeno, Cilantro, Pickled Carrot and Daikon, slathered with mayo and Pate and stuffed with cured meats, such as Cha Lua (cured pork sausage) or other types of deli ham encased in a French baguette.

I've been here 3 times now and am planning a 4th trip.

First time- I was part of the Lincoln Park Pub Santa Crawl and we stopped here. We waited outside for a few minutes and the manager let us up to a private room where  a polka band was playing. It was a beautiful room, they did an excellent job with the interior of this space!

The second time I brought my parents in after a Lolly the Trolley tour. It was the most fun I'd seen them have in ages. They both climbed up on the beer hall bench and clapped along with the crowd. As I swung by beer back and forth, Mom was reminded  of her youth- the polkas, the accordion. 

Service is always great and prices are fair. The food is delicious and I enjoy the authentic menu. I can't wait to try something new.

Nothing was really wrong with either the food or service, but nothing about the experience was particularly fun or exciting. It all just felt a bit contrived -- but maybe that's what happens when you serve croquettes, chorizo and bacon-wrapped pepper-stuffed dates in a yawning 4-million dollar space. There's no real energy to the place; it just dissipates.

Service was super friendly but they screwed up one dish (brought us plain pan con tomate and not with the anchovies we wanted) and the pace was way off, as our first 3 plates all came within 10 minutes after we ordered. I was also a little bit peeved that the ""small"" meat and cheese plate I asked for (after we already ate five or six dishes) ended up being three full orders of individual meats and cheeses each for 49 bucks. I just wanted something small to munch on but obviously I wasn't clear or Patria didn't bother to just put a couple half-plates together.

Wine markups are insane, at 4x for a 25-dollar bottle I could find at the LCBO a block away. (I ordered it anyways so I guess that's my fault.)

1) Parking lot in strip mall so ample parking available always!

2) It's always packed when we come here, so it can take a little bit of time to finally get seated, but it's definitely worth the wait! 

3) Ordering food was quick, yet difficult because of their extensive menu of tons of delicious options! Servers were very helpful in recommending options.

4) We've done family style ordering and it's hard to go wrong with any dish! Cucumber salad, crab rangoons, chicken lemongrass coconut soup (all time favorite!!), chicken panang, shrimp pad prik kow, pineapple fried rice, brown rice (which has a cool purple/red tinge) have all been amazing! Different spice levels are offered, but I'd recommend going lower and adding your own spice if you're unsure of how much you can handle. Ask the food to be extra hot because it is sometimes a little at room temperature by the time you start eating it. 

5) Food came out quickly after having the order taken. The waiters were doing a good job of asking us if we needed anything. There was so much food and for reasonable prices! For 4 of us, it came out to about $40, so not bad at all, especially considering we had leftovers (leftovers are what students survive on :-P )

6) Service was great. Nice, clean place. Love the minimalistic decor and the restrooms are clean, too. Not too loud and quiet location as the strip mall has always seemed dead whenever we go, despite it having the EOS fitness there.

The restaurant is hidden on the second floor of the Venetian. You have to walk to the check-in area, take the elevator to the second floor. Then take a left when exiting the elevator. Apparently, there is a sign, but it isn't very noticeable. 

The order was:
* Oysters on half shell $18 and Clams $1.95 each. There were multiple oyster choices to choose from, but at the end, we choose kumamotos. The oysters were small, sweet, fresh, but I really didn't like their condiment choices. It was either ketchup or balsamic vinegar. I would have preferred some mignonette dressing and/or tabasco sauce and/or raw horseradish. Clams were also sweet and fresh. No complaints there.
* Steak Frites $36.75 (4 of 5) - pan-seared prime flatiron, caramelized shallots & maître d hôtel butter, served with French fries. Traditional steak and fries done perfectly.
* Gnocchi à la Parisienne $26.75 (5 of 5) - sautéed gnocchi, with a fricassée of garden vegetables & brown butter sauce. Amazing!!! The gnocchi tasted like clouds. It was light when you bit into it but heavy tasting in the belly because of the butter sauce. The complimenting vegetables were tasty and balanced with the gnocchi perfectly.
* Sole Marinière $36.75 (4 of 5) - sautéed fillet of sole, caramelized baby artichokes,
 Manila clams, oyster mushrooms, & coco beans.  The sole was delicious pan fried. It had a crispy outer layer and a soft inner layer. The sole was fresh and very tasty. 
* Moules au Tolouse $28.75 (4 of 5) - Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, Tolouse sausage & tomato oil. The mussels were fresh. The mussels were steamed in a strong white sauce. I absolutely adored the pot it was served-in. There was a metal mesh on one corner of the pot and you could dip your bread into that corner, without brushing the mussels to the side. It was a minor detail, but it was obviously very useful. Rather than having to take all the mussels out or finishing the mussels to get to the white sauce, Bouchon created a nook to dip the bread. And, it doesn't hurt, their complimentary bread, is none other than, their popular Epi Baguette. Yeah for free yummy bread.

I actually like Bouchon Las Vegas more than Bouchon Yountville. I like their restaurant spacing & menu selections in Las Vegas. If you are in the neighborhood of Las Vegas strip, I strongly recommend brunch or dinner at Bouchon.",2012-08-16 18:30:40

First of all, the building and atmosphere is awesome. I think it used to be a Bank of America? They really outdid themselves with the renovations and decor. 

The drinks, while pricey, are really good. I had the basil-gin-strawberry drink and it was deeeelishhhh. My husband had a tasty IPA he has never had before. 

Service was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant. 

When it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time. 

Vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasn't impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu. With a side of their yummy spicy mayo.

Talking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious. The parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior. It kind of ruined the mood for us. I wish they would have just gone to Peter Piper like most kids teams do after a game...

I came here just to get a drink and hangout with friend after we had finished lunch at a nearby restaurant. The cafe is located upstairs nears the Shoppers, and when we came here on a weekday afternoon it wasn't very busy. I would say the renovation is pretty cute, like a little girl's princess fantasy room, though I have to point out that the chairs are a little old and needs some maintenance/updating. The fabric sofas are a little dirty and you can tell the arm chairs are pretty worn out due to the sinking seat cushion and the torn arms rests. It is still quite comfy to sit on though.

I ordered the Americano and my friend ordered the Yam Latte. The Americano was alright and the cup was decent sized for the price of around $3.5. My friend's Yam Latte was kinda expensive at $5 and the portion is pretty small (see picture) and it didn't taste very good. The Yam Latte tasted like warm milk mixed with some yam paste, wasn't very enjoyable that's for sure. We didn't try any of the food items, but just from the prices and the photos, it didn't look as good as other dessert house nearby that also offers waffles/crepes. Their cakes at the counter did look tasty however, as they were made by another bakery.

The table for two which my wife and I occupied was about fourteen inches from the next one. The taking of our order was twice interrupted order, our server having to back up and get out of the way when another worker wished to walk by.  In order to clear the table next to ours, the busser had to bend over, whereupon her buttocks were practically in our faces.  When a gentleman walked past our table, he came within a fraction of an inch of his raincoat brushing my sandwich: you get the picture.

The prices are high for the quantity of food provided.  The matzoh ball soup was satisfactory (though not as good as what I prepare from a packaged mix).  It was $5.95 for a bowl with two large balls and it was served to us with its temperature a step below warm. The soup was served with five crispy noodles. I ordered the chazzer size Montreal beef sandwich (the literal Yiddish translation of chazzer is ""pig""). I thought this might be in the mold of traditional delicatessen mammoth sandwiches with about a pound of beef on it; that was not the case. There was nothing piggish about this $15.99 dish; it was standard size.  The latke tots, $5, was a portion suitable for one person with an appetite.  My wife had an eggplant sandwich, $11.99.  

Managers were in circulation, but neither provided a quality check or paid any attention to the customers other than to bring food and remove plates. One of these individuals is a sister of one of the owners and serves as the operator of the restaurant; she was glum.

The food was generally tasty and our server was pleasant and reasonably efficient, but the atmosphere and logistics of the place are so abominable as to ruin any meal.  I suppose this is what one should expect from the owners of Pamela's, another establishment with good food, but in which customers are jammed into spaces in violation of the standards of the Geneva Conventions.

Wanting something new I convinced everyone at work to order from here.  The menu differs a bit from the other typical places.  Collectively we all thought this was a great thing.  That is until the ordering process started.  We had a little bit of a misunderstanding while ordering from phone.  So much so that some items that were ordered did not show up.  We could have gone around this hiccup and not have had such an experience if we would have went another way of ordering.  You can order online or through an app.  According to the menu we have, if you do order from the app you get a 5% discount.  After the food arrived we had to call back and make them aware of the mistake.  With a huff on the other end of the line, you could tell that customer service is something they need to work on.

As for the food, a majority of us that ordered agree that they hit it out of the ballpark.  I had the R&B's House Burger which comes with fries.  It's kind of like a mammoth burger.  Two thick patties with your choice of American or provolone cheese.  Burgers come with lettuce, pickle, onion and tomato automatically.  The burger tasted great and definitely was filling.  I kind of needed a nap afterwards.  The fries however weren't the best.  You could tell they were frozen from a bag.  Meh, you can't have everything.

Likeliness to recommend 1/5

Location and ambiance:
Located in a busy plaza on Sp.Mt. that typically already have huge issues with parking.
- the restaurant is very half assed and unfinished.  I understand they removed all the booths/ decor from the previous tenant. But they didn't bother covering up any holes or patch up the walls with new paint. There's several hanging lights missing. Personally to me.. if a restaurant is new, I expect it to look like the previous tenant cuz it's reusable or something new and turn key.  I don't wanna dine in a place that looks like someone just moved out.

Staff:
Staff is friendly and nice.  We were greeted promptly and water and comp appetizers arrived right away after we sat down.  My only complaint is the staff is constantly on their cell phone. They are super nice and polite when you get their attention but they're not very attentive on their own.

Food:
We ordered the steamed egg with minced meat.  Came out super fast.  A little too salty for me but my husband thought it was good.  
Then he ordered the first thing on the menu, pig intestines noodle.  All we tasted was the heavy peppercorn and no other depth of flavor coming through.  My husband had to ask for soysauce and vinegar to tweak it.  I ordered the Hot and Sour Noodle which was tasty and I loved the thin homemade noodle texture. Doesn't blow my mind, but it was a good choice.

Likeliness to return:
For what it is, we're probably not going to return.  So far there isn't a flavor that I crave.  However, it's not terrible so should any friends wanna dine here we wouldn't refuse.

I didn't like the band who played yesterday May 15, but this is very personal. The next DJ was one of the WORST DJs I've ever seen in my life, totally unable to mix tracks, trying to make mashups like a 3 year-old, and I almost left the place because of him. BUT...

You then pick a seat, and a server will bring you a dish of cucumbers, radishes and limes along with 2 salsas and a homemade chili oil to munch on until your food comes out (which is never long).  And let me tell you, everything is lick your lips, kiss the air, and squeal with delight flavorful and delicious!!  My favorite 2 meats are the carne asada and the pastor.  I can't even describe how juicy and tasty they are....you just have to trust me.  Everything comes out piping hot with fresh onions and cilantro on top, and it is utter perfection.

Downtown's Plaza Gets a Facelift

It was only 11 years ago that then-Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman advocated the implosion of the city's downtown Plaza Hotel & Casino. Yet today, following extensive renovations in 2010 and 2011 and recent management changes, it has recaptured its former glory, 
culminating in the opening of a multimillion-dollar new rooftop pool experience this summer.

""The new rooftop pool will offer guests a modern poolside destination downtown that still reflects the Plaza's classic Vegas ambience,"" said Plaza CEO Jonathan Jossel.

Built in 1971, the Plaza Hotel & Casino marries vintage Rat Pack attitude to decidedly modern styling and amenities.

Its 1,003 guest rooms and suites are renovated with custom-designed Mark David furnishings complemented by upscale contemporary fittings acquired from the bankrupt ""Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas"" project on the Strip.

The Plaza boasts more than 500 slot machines in its 80,000-square-foot casino, a 500-seat classic Vegas showroom hosting nationally acclaimed entertainment and a variety of dining venues led by Oscar's Beef-Booze-Broads steakhouse (named, ironically, for the famously larger-than-life Goodman) in the landmark glass dome overlooking the Fremont Street Experience. Its 75-screen race and sports book is downtown's largest.

Since taking over as CEO of Plaza operators PlayLV a year ago, Jossel has enacted numerous changes at the property. At 32, he's one of the youngest nonrestricted gaming licensees in Las Vegas and he has injected a youthful energy and inspiration that has palpably improved the Plaza's financial picture.

For example, in the first quarter of 2016, the Plaza Hotel & Casino has experienced a year-over-year increase of 17.3% in gaming revenue and a 20.2% increase in hotel revenue.

Jossel revamped the Plaza's casino operations by upgrading video poker, focusing on bingo and improving table game odds.

Extensive renovations of the Plaza's 70,000-square-foot rooftop pool deck began in January, including the addition of new cabanas, daybeds, dining areas, bars and greenery, and resurfacing of the deck itself.

""In addition to comfortable and fun new poolside amenities, we will offer guests live entertainment, gaming and a full menu of food and beverage options,"" Jossel said. ""We will create a pool experience unlike any other in downtown Las Vegas that our hotel guests and locals will love.""

The Plaza plans to celebrate the pool's grand opening during the Fourth of July weekend, though guests who show up in June will get to see it sooner",2016-06-13 09:45:07

The only negative was the portion sizes were all over the place with some appetizers being the same size as the entrees.  I think they could bolster a few dishes even with the use of greens or more of the starch and the value perception would increase dramatically. When considering the price and portion size this restaurant really ends up being about the same as many of the higher end restaurants on the strip. I don't have a problem with this but feel they may be hurting themselves by becoming more of a special occassion restaurant vs. a weekly haunt for some.

The experience couldn't have gone better in ANY WAY!.  Dave and his crew of professionals made sure that we were informed of the progress as we went along. The price and time lines were adhered to and they communicated with the insurance companies. The work was done a week ahead of time and the quality of workmanship is superior. I would HIGHLY recommend USA Collision and have already referred several people.  This is exactly the kind of business that deserves to get referrals and be in business.

I ordered the chicken cutlets with, mashed potatoes and collards. You can tell the cutlets had been frozen for a while, Mash potatoes were out of the box and way to runny, and the collards were actually pretty good.

Their funnel cakes!!! I don't usually order ice cream cones here but I wasn't hungry enough for a full funnel cake. They're famous for their funnel cakes and ice creams and often you find yourself lining up in the summer time. When I had my first funnel cake, it was in wonderland and I always thought you can only get funnel cakes in wonderland so I always looked forward to the day when I go to wonderland. But it turns out it's not the case AND it's cheaper to get the funnel cake here too!! Fully loaded fully cake cost about $9 here!!! The soft serves are the typical soft serves and they have decent ice cream flavors too!

LAST TIP??

Don't say you've been to dairy cream without trying the funnel cake! Try different toppings. You don't necessarily need to only put strawberries. You can change up the ice cream flavours, you can add a different syrup, you can have your ice cream dipped in chocolate!",2017-06-09 04:41:03

It's freshly made on the spot and uses real fruits which not gonna lie is a hard thing to come by sometimes. Romeo (I assume) made my drink and asked if I was okay with honey and fat-free yogurt (of course!). From what I can tell, he really cares about his business and just loves what he is doing which is always great to see.

CON
It is pricer when you compare it to other juice places but I always say you get what you pay. I do wish he added more guava to my drink since I really enjoy that sweet flavor of guava -- but I think if I asked he probably would have.

The waitress brought us a beer menu while we looked at the food options.

Beers seemed very reasonably priced and we ordered burgers plus the buffalo chicken bites. The burgers were just as good as we had heard. The blue cheese sauce with the chicken had lots of chunks of blue.

My only complaint was that our waitress appeared to be the only server working that day, perhaps because of the holiday?

I think a lot of people are going to try to compare these noodles to ramen, but these dishes have some distinct qualities I've never experienced before. 

We came in on a Friday night and there were only 2-3 other tables occupied. The clientele is mostly all Chinese so you know they're doing something right. As soon as we were seated the waitress brought us mung bean soup and pickled vegetables. The mung bean soup is used to cool off your mouth after eating the spicy foods. It tastes like iced tea but has beans in the bottom of it that sort of resemble split pea soup. It does work to cool you off so use it. No one is drinking water here. 

To start we ordered the steamed egg with minced pork which is seriously amazing. The pork is oily and savory while the egg is light and creamy. Definitely suggest getting this dish. After that we both ordered the house beef noodle. The dish itself is just gorgeous: a mix of white noodles, green vegetables and red soup.The noodles are less springy than ramen noodles, but taste fresh and almost floury. It filled me up a lot quicker because they were more dense. The broth is light but intense with flavor and heat. We usually go for super spicy ramen but we did a ""regular spicy"" here and I'm glad we did. The thing that I was not expecting was the tingling that happens in your whole mouth after eating the food. It's not like your mouth becomes numb from the heat, it's that the Sichuan peppers actually cause a tingling sensation. Drink mung bean soup to alleviate some of the tingling. The meat in the dish was very tender but a little fatty at times. I think this is a great intro dish. Next time I'd love to try some of the noodle dishes without soup. Overall I'm glad we tried Mian out. It's always exciting having new food experiences like this and I recommend to anyone who likes ramen and wants something more adventurous.",2018-03-24 16:33:58

I have been trying to find furniture to make a small bedroom into a sitting room/office. In addition, I sometimes need to nap in my office during the day. A love seat or chair-and-a-half were a little too small to nap on but most of the sofas I looked at were too big for the room. 

Ryan showed me smaller pieces of furniture in the main showroom and in the Clearance area. This particular store has a warehouse in the back with discounted items. Since Ryan really listened to what I needed, he recommended a large ottoman with a single, pull-out bed in it. Who even knew there was such a thing? He then asked one of the designers to help me find a chair to go with the ottoman. I ended up buying a Kasen loveseat​ that had been marked down from $570.00 to $126.00. It was in the Scratch and Dent section but there isn't actually anything wrong with it, it's beautiful and comfortable!

I was really impressed with this particular​ Living Spaces store. The customer service was really great and I found a solution​ to my problem that was beyond my expectations. The ottoman (brown leather) matches my living room furniture and I can even roll it out of the bedroom when I need extra seating for a party.

I was given a shampoo and wash before we started so it makes it easier to cut. I got a bald fade and it is symmetrically well trimmed off my frame.

She started with a number of songs from Xanadu and then transitioned to some country and western (a bit twangy but tolerable).  There were some songs that I hadn't heard before which is always good.  She ended with a medley of songs from Grease--not my favorite movie nor group of songs.  There was an audience sing-a-long with her and then more with her back up singers while she went off stage to change for her final numbers.  The concert ended with a real favorite song of mine--Peter Allen's ""I really Love You.""

The band is excellent and the singers with are are very good, too!  I was a bit disappointed to see three monitors at different spots on the stage with lyrics scrolling by.  I guess it's just a safety feature in case she might get stuck on remembering the lyrics to a particular song.

I thought the ceviche was terrible - there was way, way too much salt in the mixture and it was effectively inedible. The bright red chips that came with the ceviche, along with the regular chips that came with the guac were super crisp and tasted of stale oil. The guac was tasted good where it was mixed properly, but there were two huge chunks - almost a half avocado's worth - of solid, underripe avocado, which is unacceptable at this price. The salvation of the meal was probably the flan. While it was closer to being overcooked, with some air bubbles scattered throughout, it was still pretty close to a decent, smooth flan.

I'm no expert on the different kinds of wax that are out there, but I liked the one that she used because it hurt way less than what I was used to. Even when she used the tweezers to pull out some hairs, it didn't seem to hurt too much. Melissa is very sweet and friendly, and she took the time to explain a few things to me.

N-eTdSQvozac9u5o8jeljQ,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,keOzwoc28Iac5mA8FD93uA,5,16,10,14,"Weeks ago, I had been cruising down Brookline Boulevard and was dismayed that Tisha's Sunny Farms had apparently been displaced by a new restaurant. However, when I noticed that it had been replaced by a Southern eatery, I was intrigued, eagerly anticipating its grand, grand opening. When Mother's Day was upon us, my dear mum exclaimed ""Bama's! Bama's!"" when asked about her meal, and Dad and I took care of the rest. 

Bama's interiors are modestly appointed, but their food is anything but, generously served and living large on plates and in bellies. 

The beautifully bark-laden (St. Louis?) Pork Ribs (Bama's also offers Beef Ribs) we ordered for our takeout feast might as well have come from a barbecued brontosaurus. Smoked with an exquisite subtlety, succulent as the greatest of steaks, and as fatty and tender as the night is long, the amount of meat on each bone was astonishing and astonishingly appetizing. I almost felt as if they needed no sauce to compliment them, until I got a taste of their stingin' honey mustard and their sassy cherry red ""mild"" sauces, both kicking my taste nodules into orbit with their loud flavors

Bama's taught me love. They taught me to love sweet potatoes, their casserole taking on a pie-like quality that had me wishing I'd saved them for an after-dinner treat. 

They taught me to love mac 'n cheese, Bama's being fluffy, ethereal, wigglin', jigglin', and bold with cheddar bite. 

Bama's potato salad is a buttery, golden quagmire of savoriness and texture. As a connoisseur of this staple of cookouts and picnics, Bama's ranks as a top 5 contender, pushing Grandma's off to the corner forever. 

Again, recalling dessert in the same manner as the Sweet Potato Casserole, the Cornbread Muffins would have fooled me into thinking them to be cupcakes if a cream cheese icing had been applied or a strawberry shortcake if the juicy, crimson fruit and whipped cream accompanied them. Dense and sweet, no condiments were necessary. 

This brings us to the proper dessert offerings in the Apple Crisp and the Peach Cobbler. Served in deep cups, the molten, chunky fillings in each were complimented by the kind of sugary, crunchy coating/crust that rules bake sales nationwide and begs for vanilla ice cream. 

That Bama's is not yet another Boulevard pizza parlor is commendable. 

That Bama's was being deluged by customers when we arrived to pick up our food was encouraging. 

That Bama's is serving up supremely tasty Southern cooking in Brookline is a miracle.

P.S. As I write this, my family and I are lethargic from the amount of pork we consumed. Gorged and happy we are, and the leftovers are plentiful, Bama's unsparing portions positively spoiling us.",2014-05-11 22:03:12

Clothes alone could span an entire review here. They've got everything you can imagine that fits the era. Think turtle necks, high waist jeans and wide belts to name just a few things. Western gear is in good representation too with tons of belts, buckles, boots, cowfolk shirts and denim. Fabrics representative of the time can be found on dresses, skirts and scarves. It's so positively Laverne & Shirley and the Happy Days (this day is ooooours oh happy days!).

Probably my most favorite items that they feature here would be the furniture, dishware and jewelry though.

I have lived in Phoenix my entire life and love Pete's and this is why I can stay! lol. From the street, it looks like an old take-out place that's all cute and retro... but noooooo... it's really an old take out place. and it produces some serious food! Whenever I go, I always peek at the mini factory of people dredging and frying all sorts of goodies. Shrimp (my fave), fish filets, hush puppies, corndogs, burritos and fries. 

Once upon a time there used to be signs that read ""NO TATAR SAUCE, SO DON'T EVEN ASK!"" and all you had was Pete's patented red sauce that was part ketchup, part hot sauce but all lovely. Pete's sauce made everything taste better. It went well with the corndogs, the burritos, the fish, the shrimp, the fries and don't even get me started on the burgers!
Sadly, after DECADES of refusing the Phoenix masses their precious tartar sauce and forcing them to enjoy Pete's sauce (for their own good) Pete's has caved and now offers Tartar sauce... and it sucks! So now many people won't even get the chance to even try the glorious Pete's sauce... cuz they want their old standard Tartar sauce! *sigh*

The pie and salad arrived in exactly 45 minutes. I might pick up next time since my friends apt is so close. That chicken salad with Italian dressing looked so big, but we smashed every delicious morsel. Nice leafy greens and quality ingredients, I will order a salad every time. 

The cheese pie (medium) was the best. I can't explain it, just trust me and try it for yourself. It's not a thin crust, but definitely a thinner crust. My only complaint, too small. Two girls could have totally shared a large with no leftovers (we had the munchies). 

Anyhoo, great experience all in all, delicious!",2012-12-07 23:00:56

ZzbPOPSzs00KZaKH8gkXpg,SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,ypfFfR3-PbtoslIhohNstw,3,1,0,0,"Review of the AYCE BBQ!  The meat was delicious but the sides and slow service bring the overall rating down.

Party of 9 sitting at 2 tables. 

Side dishes get 3/5: there are fish cakes, cole slow and some other non-memorable sides. They don't have the potatoes or seaweed salad. I would say that Lee's has the most disappointing sides of the other bbq places I've been to around the area. 

Sides: bean soup, steamed egg ... steamed egg is good..pretty much a scrambled egg in a bowl mixed with some salt water

Meat: delicious. Apparently there is a special cut of meat (and expensive cut) that only Lee's has--this is what my krn friend said.  That 'special' meat cut was amazingly delicious and tender. They also have the standard bulgogi, kalbi and the pork bacon strips which I'm not the biggest fan of. 

Service gets 2/5 for being so slow: we had empty plates pile up on separate occasions during our meal; empty meat plates and egg bowls that we were waiting to have cleared. We even had to wait a while for the check to come...you know that while where EVERYONE in your party is waiting for the check. Getting refills for water was also a little annoying.

Coke is ~$2.50 per can

They have nice chopsticks. Light but not thin.  They are easier to grasp than those standard thin krn chopsticks. 

Saw Lee himself eating at the other table. 

Overall, imo, Lee's is not the best korean bbq place in Vegas as others have said. The sides were meh and the service was slow.  Yes, they do have a special cut of meat here but for an overall excellent krn bbq experience, I recommend Honey Pig.",2013-04-13 20:26:23

As I stood in line I tried to take in everything...the decor, food and drink menu items, and overall feel. If authentic French cafes are anything like this place, BOOK ME A TICKET!

Everyone was sitting doing their own thing just enjoying the moment. I attempted to read the menu items in my French voice in my head, but they came out sounding more like Spanish...wished my son was there.

I ordered the Provence BLT for us to share, two palmiers because I hardly ever share sweets, and an iced coffee with vanilla (not sure of the French name).

I conveniently left the items in the car so that when we hopped in to begin his birthday weekend...""Well whaddayaknow breakfast for our ride out to the vineyards!""

One of my recent food cravings is Dukboki- I havent really looked around for other places that offer it, but this is where I go for it. Im seriously just happy to know a place that has it..Its good enough to satisfy my craving so Im happy. 

On my most recent visit (this review), we got dukboki, Spareribs, and a spicy chicken (cant remember the exact name!). Everything was incredible for me. The only issue I had that that the sparerib meat was a little inconsistent. Some pieces were tough while others were really tender. Im not a butcher or anything, but im not inclined to believe there is any reason for this other than the meat not being cooked enough. Feel free to somehow correct me if I am wrong!

The spicy levels are tolerable here. Im not sure if they toned it down for me or anything, but it was definitely not death-level spicy like Ive had at other Korean restaurants. Maybe of you like it that way you should ask them to make it ""really spicy"". Just a thought.",2018-02-03 02:26:18

My hard tire cover has never come off my vehicle. After going through the wash, I am being told it fell under the vehicle and the driver didn't hear the load noise of him dragging it across the parking lot to be dried. Once he got it to the drying area, he threw his hands up and shrugged his shoulders, hid it behind the trash bin and I was not notified by one person working nor was the manager onsite. I was walking around my vehicle and looking for it, no workers saying a word trying to hide this mistake from me when the other people that were waiting on their cars who witnessed the whole thing had to tell me what happened and where they hid my tire cover. It was at this point a worker finally spoke to me and asked if I wanted a manager, I said yes. The worker then tried to start buffing out the damage that the driver had done. It can't be buffed out since it took the paint completely off the cover. I filed a report and was told I would get a callback today, the 2nd manager in charge had no business cards to give me. I then called 2 hours upon me leaving because I wanted a full refund. The damage, time and hassle this has and will caused is already ridiculous and I didn't think I should have to pay for the services provided. I had to leave a message for Brian, when he didn't call me back, I had to call him again this morning. He informed me they are not liable for the damage which is insane. The noise that the people described, they said the driver just didn't care and it was obvious. I then told Brian exactly what happened with his employees hiding this from me and he said that is not what he was told. So now, not only do I have damage to me car, think very little of the employees and leadership at this location but I am being told they are not responsible and I won't be getting a refund and I am completely unclear if Jackson's will be paying for the careless damage that their driver caused to my vehicle. Brian said he would need to look at the security tape after I explained what happened and he will be getting back to me. This is beyond poor customer experience. Why had he not already looked if I left a message yesterday and why is he taking the word of these employees that tried to hide the act in the first place from me, the customer. I truly believe that they were hoping I didn't notice the cover gone and I would just leave not knowing any better. Shame on all the employees that have ""helped"" me so far. I was a full refund and I want the damage to my car fixed.

Brian--the manager called me back and stated:
No liability- the black was clearly showing which indicates it's loose. The only thing not acceptable was him throwing his hands in the air and I will talk to him about that. They just didn't get a chance to help or explain. He said ""absolutely not"" they were going to tell me even though they hadn't alerted me or a manager. When I asked if he clearly knew it was loose, why wouldn't an employee and he said it's because of his 15 years of history. His workers wouldn't know that so it was a problem with the vehicle even though I've never had this problem before and his employees don't need to look under vehicles and maybe the radio was on and that's why he didn't hear it scraping across the parking lot like everyone else. I advised my radio was off, something I always do because you pull up and talk to the workers. I asked for a refund, he declined and offered me a free oil change and carwash and said it clearly shows on all their receipts, no refunds. At this point, I had to actually tell him I never wanted to go back here again with this terrible customer service and now having to listen to the main manager blaming me and defending all of his employees actions and telling me that I have to pay $50 for getting my car damaged by his employees and telling me it's not their fault is beyond infuriating. This call turned into him defending everything that was done when there is no defending the type of behavior that his employees displayed yesterday. He was even concerned that no one alerted the manager on duty. I wanted a name and number above him, he informed me that they would just route the call right back to him. I asked for it anyway and said I would prefer to speak to someone that can actually give me my money back as I think an exception should be made in this case.
 
 Got a callback from corporate that had the exact same tune as Brian. Said that the most they can do is give me quotes from body shops for me to pay for the damage myself and they will not be refunding me any money. I'm not sure what type of manager really can't credit back $50.69 when their company damaged your car.",2016-03-18 23:15:57

Originally a factory for Model T cars, then an assembly location for Hercules missiles during the world wars, and most recently a Rite-Aide distribution center, the 75-acre property just oozes history. 

I had the privilege of attending a Creative Mornings Charlotte event (the speaker was Harvey Gantt, also all kinds of awesome) at Camp North End this morning and am telling you... Mark my words... This place is going to change the game in Charlotte. A gathering place that respects the local neighborhoods, community personality, and history. What a novel concept for a city that seems ready to tear down old spots for new, shiny condos or apartments at the drop of a hat! 

I can't wait to hang out here this summer in the beautiful, outdoor courtyard area with sweeping views of the uptown skyline when they start hosting gatherings with food trucks, pop up shops, etc.

The drinks taste amazing but be careful, they are very strong. You will want to pace yourself for sure. 

The food taste good but don't come hungry. The portions are small so if you're expecting to fill up, you'll need to order many items before feeling satisfied. Their small plates are full of flavor so if you just need a snack it's a nice treat.

a.  Food - The food here is focused on the American palate and taste, so if you like beef broccoli, mongolian beef, cashew chicken, chow mein, wonton soup, pot stickers and fried rice, this is the place for you. However, for authentic Chinese cuisine, this does not compare at all.  In fact, most of the food here on this menu you can find at near 40% lower prices at any other Chinese fast food take out place.  So, if you like the American style food, I give this 4 star, if you like authentic Chinese, I give this 2 star.  

b.  Price - 10-15.00 per plate, I think that this is a bit over priced, and the taste is not so different than the Chinese food they have at the buffet, so I give the price a 2 star. 

c.  Ambiance - Very nice, authentic looking place, they have a very nice room in the back for parties. I think you could fit 30 people onto three tables.  This is very nice.  5 Star!

d.  Service - I was there with a larger party of about 15 people and the servers / wait staff advised us to order two soups per table for the amount we had. That was a HUGE mistake because one soup bowl can probably hold 2-3 quarts of soup and so there was a lot of left over. One bowl would have been  plenty. Also, each dish was a 1.5 size portion, but they advised us on the sizing and it was way too much.  While attentive and nice, the information was poor. I give this a 2 star. 

e.  Location - Well located at the casino, and very convenient to pop in and enjoy if you are at the casino for other reasons. You have to wade through the smoke and stale atmosphere of the casino floor and there is no place to wait or linger if you have kids, since you are in a casino.  So while not unbearable, this is an adult area so do not expect too many accommodations for kids.

I give this a 2 star because for American food, it is decent, however, it is very over priced and a bit uninspired.  The place is basically form over content and fits well with the Casino. It is, like PF Chang and that is the best way to describe it.

He went above and beyond my expectations as a server. Great personality, Great service. Very attentive and accommodating to my dietary needs. 5 Stars just for service seriously. 

Food was great too. I had Chicken Breast with broccolini. It was cooked to perfection. It was so tender & juicy. A nice change from my dried out home cooked chicken, lol

Let me start telling you about my background. I am from the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, where the authentic ""churrasco"" is from. While I cannot find a really authentic place here in the US (because they are not run by authentic gauchos from the south) there are many others that can serve a delicious churrasco. Chima does delivers a delicious meal, however, for their price range I am obligated to compare them to other upscale ""churrascarias"" like Fogo de Chao, Plataforma (NYC) and Texas de Brazil. Chima is probably 4th in the list. I rated them this low because for the price they do charge in Charlotte (because they can) is not compatible with the quality of service and meat variety we get in these other upscale churrascarias. 

This place is surprising the busiest restaurant in Charlotte and I do see why. Where in uptown you pay $50 and can taste so many different cuts of beef? Exactly! But like I said before, being in other churrascarias I think that Chima is overrated as they are trying to compare themselves to Fogo de Chao, which they are not.

It is still an excellent experience if you have never been, but as a Brazilian I rarely go because with the price tag they have, we can have an outstanding meal in other steakhouses around uptown.

Sides are nothing too special, fried polentas are good but way worse than Fogo de Chao.

Chima also does not open for lunch (except in special days) and when they open for lunch they usually charge $37 however they do reduce the variety of cuts and also their service is not too good. As an example, in Miami, Fogo de Chao charges $30 for lunch and they have the exactly same menu as dinner.

They also do not feature chicken hearts (which may sound yucky but it is a must have in churrascarias) and they also marinate the beef with garlic in some cuts which is an assassination to the method of preparing the food. The garlic is to mask the bad taste of the beef cut. A real beef cut is seasoned with sea salt only (maybe some pepper) and not with garlic. There was even a project of ""law"" in southern Brazil that to be called churrasco only Sea Salt should be used, no garlic, no pepper.

Desserts are expensive and not required. In Brazil, churrascarias often don't charge for deserts and you would have a buffet. Some upscale churrascarias charge for it.",2015-04-29 19:20:58

This was my first time at the Mesa location. I ordered the Vegan Pilgrim (vegan turkey, cranberry sauce, Sriracha, vegan dirty sauce + lettuce [I omitted the vegan cheese]) on their french roll/bread. I know, I know. That combination makes no sense, right? Wrong! I've learned to leave my inhibitions down the street and around the corner, and to just trust Ike's on whatever his board says. It. Was. So. Good!  (1/2 of this sandwich never made it out of my parking space!) Cranberry sauce + Sriracha on a ""turkey"" sandwich? Who'd a ""thunk""?!

That's mostly what you'll find here. An amazing concoction of drool & moan-worthy creations (Meg Ryan/Sally, you ain't ready, girl!), surrounded by delicious, homemade bread. Their Dutch Crunch bread is a must try!  They also have a few simple sandwiches, for you retired daredevils. 

Supposedly, there are 100 veggie sandwich options, most of which can be veganized. So for all of my fellow vegans, just be sure to tell them to make it vegan. Here's a vegan breakdown:
They use Daiya for the cheeses, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs. 
All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat). 
The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version. 
The ""Air"" fries and tater tots are vegan (and they are baked, not fried).
Their Dirty Sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version (it's delicious!)
Their purple coleslaw is vegan.
There's a vegan french dressing and BBQ sauce.

Not vegan: 
Their pesto, honey mustard sauce, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses). 
Sun-Devil sauce is NOT vegan & there is no vegan version.

Veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan.

They have gluten-free options. 

The girl helping me out was super nice and knowledgeable about their vegan menu. I had a question about the french dressing, and she had a handy-dandy cheat sheet which she used to confirm that it is vegan (or they have a vegan option; I didn't clarify).

Most of the sandwiches are @ $10, but they are big enough to either share or save 1/2 for another day. They offer chips (most of which are vegan too; just avoid the Salt & Vinegar and the BBQ Ranch), bottled and fountain drinks. Nice sized location with plenty of tables and booths inside. There are only a couple of tables outside. It shares a big parking lot with other establishments, so there is plenty of parking.  Located about 3 lights north of US 60, off of the Alma School exit, on the east side of the street (opposite side of the street from the Fiesta Mall). 

Ike's is like the Lady Gaga of sandwiches: extravagant, daring, and shockingly good. I can't wait to go back.",2014-09-26 05:17:31

Atmosphere: Lively!
It's your typical sit-down restaurant setting: people waiting, servers and baristas moving about getting their orders out as quickly as possible. Nothing out the ordinary that makes this Olive Garden stick out from your usual dine-in chain. With subtle music in the background, it's actually quite nice.

Service: I appreciate them! (Except for waiting so long)
Initially, we were told that our waiting time was 25+ minutes, but upon further inquiry, our waiting time was decreased to just 15 minutes.

Our waitress was absolutely amazing, polite, and very appreciate of our presence. What I liked about my server the most was they she said, ""I appreciate you,"" That sounded really great to my ears, honestly. Having just this waitress interact with us made my visit!

Food: Quite nice, but nothing spectacular
This visit, I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich with a side of fries and marinara sauce. The chicken Parmesan is served in a larger-sized breadstick bun, which was not horrible at all. Tasted like your typical chicken parm, minus the pasta, of course.

In addition to the sandwich, I had the side salad and their berry sangria. The salad was served with Italian vinaigrette, which gave it good acidity and flavor. It tasted even better with our request of having no olives. The sangria was sweet, flavorful, and went well with the meal overall; didn't taste too alcoholic, either!

Overall: Good visit!
I really liked coming here and enjoying a meal with my friends. What killed it the most was being told to wait for 25 minutes. Good thing our waiting time was reduced! This is probably my favorite dining experiences at Olive Garden. Stop by at this location if you can!",2016-04-12 05:06:49

I would honestly have to look at a menu again and see exactly what I ordered. I know 1 was spiced rubbed chicken, another spiced rubbed steak. I could taste the spice it was right up my spiced rubbed dreams. I put some corn salsa, pico, onions, lime cilantro crema. Carolina reaper salsa comes on the side.

They had raw oysters which look fresh but they were warm.
The food is typical buffet but I like how they set it up the area, modern. The food station area was very clean however the table area was kind of messy. The booth they sat us in still had some food and napkins underneath. Our server barely checked on us. We had to stop her to refill drinks and stopped her to get our check. 
I didn't like that most of the food were warm when it should be hot. Preferably I like my hot food hot and cold food cold. The desert station was small. I think when I went up there, there were 3 stations, cheesecake, tiramisu and cream puffs. There was a ice cream station with a server there to scoop up the ice cream that you wanted. I like that it wasn't the kids or customers hands in the ice cream barrels trying to scoop themselves.

We ordered steamed mussels with olive oil instead of butter and they were tasty.  We also ordered the deep fried broccoli, which was also very tasty.  So far so good!

Since they smoked their own meats in house, I decided that I had to go with a meat dish for dinner.  I ordered the smoked brisket.  A short while, and many laughs later, our dinners arrived.

I understand it's an airport but, this really was very cheap and 'low brow'...especially for a place that's trying to pass itself off as being 'higher end' than the chili's that used to be there.

the food itself, was decent enough.  No complaints about the flavor or quality.  Burgers were cooked properly to order.  Service was fine....really, they have a captive audience in this airport.

SERVICES: I have used both Massage and Chiropractic within the gym, and recommend that you don't use it, it's a waste your money. I have gone a few times, massage is hit or miss and the chiropractor gives you 10 minute appointments, as opposed to the 20-30 minutes promised on the website. He is fairly good, but less than half the time is unacceptable.  I always feel ripped off when I go to their clinic, and only went back because it is so convenient that it's next door to my house.

The breakfast burger I ordered medium rare, it was delicious, but only finished half, I ate it the day after and I swear it tasted even better!!

The Ringer, medium rare, was great, but I love my first choice more, although I did devour the whole thing! I also like ot without the hot sauce, I feel like it masks the natural yumminess to the burger.

Milkshake- super rich, creamy, chocolatey, yummy crunchy-ness, if you're a Fererro Rocher fan and/or nutella, this is YOUR GO TO MILKSHAKE! 

Double Truffle Fries- they definitely don't skim on the truffle, heavy truffle taste, but thats what i love, so if you're not a die hard truffle lover, this side might be too much for you! 

Staff seems friendly, both times I've gone, my servers have always left me with empty water glasses waiting to be filled, a pet peeve of mine, please be more attentive.",2015-01-21 07:06:09

Myself and two other friends chose this place to celebrate our birthdays together.  I arrived promptly at 5:00 pm for our 5:00 pm dinner reservations. This is a large restaurant, and there were no other customers there when I walked in.  

There were several staff members seated in the back, having a ""pre-service meeting"".  The hostess would not seat me because this meeting was taking place. So, I stood around up front for about 10 minutes until the meeting broke up.  The hostess never made it clear why I couldn't just make myself comfortable at one of the dozens of other empty tables, that held no staff members, and wait for my friends to arrive.  Not off to a pleasant, nor welcoming, start.

One of my friends arrived and we started out with cocktails.  She ordered a Pimm's cup, which she had never tried before, and really liked it when it arrived.  Our other friend arrived shortly after, and decided to try the Pimm's cup as well.  However, when her drink was delivered, it was much darker than the one that our other friend had received.

Meanwhile, we all ordered dinner from our waiter, Adrian T., and everything was going along just fine.  Our food arrived and we were all enjoying it.  Two of us ordered both the roasted beet & apple dish, as well as the roasted garlic and cauliflower chowder.  Both were fine, although the chowder was overly-garlic'd.  Coming from the school of ""You Can Never Have Too Much Garlic"", I would never have imagined myself thinking that a dish could have too much garlic, but this one did. We didn't mention anything about it to the server, because he did not consider it a huge deal.

About halfway through our meal, my friend that got the first Pimm's cup, and I, ordered a second round of drinks.  Our friend that had the darker Pimm's cocktail, was struggling to get  the drink through the straw.  It apparently was prepared with too large of cucumber chunks that could not get through the straw and, the drink on the whole tasted vastly inferior to, and different from, the first Pimm's, which was delicious. Since the liquid level of the ""bad Pimm's"" was still about a half-inch from the top of the highball glass, we encouraged our friend to send the drink back, as she clearly was not enjoying it and was not going to consume it.

We flagged down Adrian T. and sent the drink back.  Our friend chose to stick with water, rather than order a different cocktail, since we were just about at the end of dinner.  Two of us ordered dessert though.  It was at this point, that there was a very distinct change in Adrian T.'s demeanor.  He basically just stopped with the pleasantries altogether, and was cold and indifferent to us. When it came time for the check, he laid it down and said nothing.  The station he was using to key-in orders was close to our table, so I got up and asked him if he was Ok.  He didn't stop, or look-up, at all and just kept keying in data while he muttered, ""I'm good.""  He dropped back off our receipt and credit cards without a word.  No, ""thank you so much"" or ""I hope to see you again"" or any such feel-goody statement that most professional servers deliver to a table as their parting words. It was all very uncomfortable, awkward and uncalled for. We still have no idea what his problem was. 

I might try this place again someday, as long as they don't seat me in Adrian T.'s section.",2015-11-08 02:09:30

It has been over a year since my last review of this place and they have really taken the time and strides to improve and be more competetive.  I say they have accomplished this.  The food has improved, the service has improved and this is a place we will give a try again.

Last night I had the Chicken and Dumplings and memories were stirred from childhood that I didn't even know were there. A large bowl of hot steamy goodness that filled, not only my hunger, but my very soul. Every bite brought back memories! 

As I watched my family eat shepard's pie and short ribs, that were fork tender on a pile of beautiful mashed potatoes, I wondered if any mother or grandmother could have done it better. Satisfied, we were, to say the least. The three of us shared a piece of chocolate cheesecake. [The chef in our family who makes the most wonderful cheesecakes couldn't have prepared it any better!

A friend and I both had our hair cut here today and it was a great overall experience.  I had a digital perm put in a few months ago and Jim knew exactly how to trim the layers to add shape without taking too much of the curl. He also definitely understands the way Asian hair moves and falls to give a cut flattering for those of us with a round face :) The only thing I don't love are my new bangs...but I may adjust to them after a couple of weeks.  I'm used to a different technique and the bangs are falling a little flat, but may perk up after I style myself.

Jim speaks very little English, but seems to understand more than he speaks.  His assistant is very fluent and is available throughout the appointment to translate the conversation between Jim and client. I always give the hair stylist a basic idea what I'm looking for, and give examples of styles I definitely do NOT like, but I like letting the stylist do a cut they think suits me, so the translating wasn't a big deal for me.  Both Jim and his assistant welcomed us and offered refreshments, hair magazines, and talked with us at length about what we were looking for before giving a thorough shampoo.  Jim does cut hair very fast, but he took time to make sure I liked the finished cut, which is when I spontaneously decided I needed new bangs (which might also be why I don't yet love them). 

Jim does both digital wavy perms, color, and Japanese magic straightening perm. I know if I decide to keep my curls I be back. Jim says he starts his digital perms at $120 - very reasonable for a digi-perm!

From the check-ins, tips and uploaded pictures, I could swear I moved a cot into the front space of the restaurant to camp out. It's obvious that Pho/noodle houses are a rarity in Scottsdale. I'm not talking about fancy schmancy because any Asian or noodle lover knows the authentic noodle houses aren't about the pretty packaging. It's what is inside. This gem hands down is consistent good food, good service and a price tag that doesn't dent your wallet just because you live in the most livable city of AZ. 

Pho is the perfect warm, hearty meal when you seek comfort. You get abundant fresh veggies consisting of the usual basil and sprouts, fresh homemade noodles and flavorful broth. I will note that even the veggie pho is incredible with the baby bok choy, broccoli, and just add tofu to the order for your protein substitute. My other go to dish is the item V1, grilled pork and shrimp noodle salad bowl. The grilled flavor of the meats scream such goodness. The egg roll and veggies are perfect crunch. With this kind of healthy and taste that doesn't disappoint, I can't imagine picking greasy food over this kind of option. Let's be honest, the only time grease is an option is for those late night outings. Pho is the perfect hangover cure!!

Like any place that offers attentive service and food that never fails to please, you will have a crowd. But the staff is always efficient in cleaning tables and turning it around in time to be out the door to punch in your time clock if needed.

The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme brûlée and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme brûlée is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too.

I came here after hearing so much about it from a couple of friends and I was in the mood for Mediterranean, so I decided to come check them out.

It was such a hassle trying to find the place. I even walked in to a different restaurant, thanks Google maps fail! Haha. But after finding the restaurant I decided to go right in.

I ordered the Chicken Curry and a side of hummus and pita chips.

Chicken Curry  - 4/5

The flavor was ok. I wasn't a big fan of it, but I wasn't unimpressed either. The flavor, although ok, felt like it was lacking something... that extra oomph that would make me want to come back and try something else on their menu. On the bright side, the Asian in Mr enjoyed the saffron rice more than the main entree itself, so I'll give them that. Rice was fluffy and not soggy. The rice was the saving grace of this dish.

Hummus and Pita Chips - 4/5

No matter where I go and try different forms of hummus, I will always be critical because I have been spoiled by a fellow coworker and friend's hummus. Yes I understand that Tahini is part of the ingredient but I am very partial to garbanzo beans. I want to taste the garbanzo and tahini working together, not just straight out tahini. And yes I am an avid salt user but the pita chips had to give me pause as it was a little bit too much salt for me.

If the craving for Mediterranean hits me again, this will not be the first thing that pops in to my mind. But if I'm in the area doing errands, I will definitely give them a try again.",2015-12-22 03:53:18

First bread was served with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and some seasoning. It was definitely a notch above you typical bread service at most restaurants.

My husband and I started with the Sophia pizza which included arugula, mushrooms, cheese and truffle oil. It was absolutely delicious.

I had the tagliatelle with meatballs in a tomato sauce and it was good. The meatballs were pretty large and the pasta was cooked al dente. It was a large portion and I only ate 1/2.

My husband ordered the burger, which was served with homemade chips. It was large and very tasty. It had salami on top and was very filling.

We also splurged for dessert and went for tiramisu. While it was tasty, I don't know that I would describe it as a traditional tiramisu as it lacked a coffee/espresso flavor. The plate featured a salted caramel drizzle, which was delicious.

Even on opening night/day, I don't think I've ever had to worry about getting a good seat. The other night, I arrived 5 minutes after previews for the new 300 sequel (I almost had a heart attack in the hallway) and still got middle seats just where I like. Their popcorn bucket deal here is worth it if you go to the movies a lot, 3 dollars to refill. It's never really crowded, quiet, and clean. Seats are just like Harkins, comfortable and able to recline back and forth unlike the sadists at AMC. Yes, the theaters are smaller then what we're used to, but with lower prices and no crowds, it doesn't make a difference to me in the end.

BEER options are rather good, something for everyone.

You get all the irish pub taps, one rotating local craft tap, a house selection, a couple Mill Street choices and some bigger international brands. 

SERVICE has been excellent on all my visits. Very friendly staff who always know when your ready for the next pint. Very consistent - I guess not being super busy helps on this front.

ATMOSPHERE & DECOR - Somewhat dated for sure. This is defiantly not the latest trendy pub!!!!! It feels / looks like an old style pub, but not dirty. I like the couch seating. They have a pool table room in the back. The bar is also very dark.

MIXED clientele for sure - everyone from students, suits, tourists, the elderly and many folks enjoying a beer on their own at the bar.

FOOD is standard pub selections. Never tried it myself but from what I can see, would probably be 2-3 star at best. Come for the beer & quiet time.

Conclusion - I like it (visited three times in the last two weeks). A perfect place to unwind after a crazy day at work. Not for the hipsters, trend setters or decor lovers (and that's OK with me).

It's one of the few restaurants, close to the heart of the entertainment district which you can make a reservation at, and inexpensive but good food. 

The pizzas were actually quite good. Thin crust, crunchy - with lots of different toppings like smokedn salmon/sour cream, spicy sausage, pineapple and pancetta. They also have the option for a gluten free crust! (I did not see a note on the menu for an extra charge, but I think they charged us $3 for this). It was crunchy and tastey, and no different from the regular crust. 
Each pizza was $14 - 16 each. If you're really hungry you could have a whole pizza to yourself, but I think best to share. 

They were able to accomodate our big group, the servers were friendly enough, and willing to do group billing. They also had a really good wine list, serving by the glass, 1/2 litre and full bottles. 

What I hated was the decor. It felt like a grade school cafeteria with wooden chairs, and plan tables. Everything was the same colour, and the place itself was small. What's also worse was the single stall bathroom, either I felt guilty for taking a long time, or I had to hurry up becuase three other people were waiting behind me.

These ones are not bright yellow, perhaps they don't use tumeric powder. What's also interesting is that their patties look thicker than most patties sold elsewhere. That is mostly due to the pastry being super fluffy/flakey, not exactly stuffed with a lot of filling.

My first impression of their patty is that it was very fluffy, and flakey, smelled great. The pastry is slightly sweet as well. It reminds me more of a pie crust.

Gone are the days of the packed house, dress code and club scene. They've attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.  I am personally not a fan of the new AB logo with the wheat behind it but I appreciate their effort to have a more ""comfortable"" neighborhood feel. I saw several people in tshirts, shorts, jeans and sunglasses. Maybe it was the NRA in town but I even spotted some decidedly ""red"" folks.  So maybe it is like a country club, but in Gastonia. :)

Their decor hasn't changed, so it still feels like a nice place, but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a Liberty gastropub. Opt for outdoor seating if the weather cooperates. Even on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice. They had a sangria special- it tastes fine enough but lacks the fun fruit you can munch on like at Sole, so I'd skip it for their nice wines.

We had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green beans. I really enjoyed the green beans- they were cooked perfectly and still retained a little snap to them. The meatloaf was also very nice.  We also had the filet mignon.  They had one misfire on temperature, but their make good efforts were overwhelming- best I've seen of any restaurant.  The remake of the steak was cooked perfectly, they replated it with new sides. The manager was very concerned about our happiness and took a lot of time talking with us.  She also invited us to their new brunch on Sundays. They apparently have a creme brulee french toast that looks divine. I wonder if it can compare with 131 Main's granola french toast?  

But I digress. The portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of mushrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions. 

We were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lovely- not too sweet, and solid texture. We opted out of dessert (a shock to both of us, I know). 

I would like to go back for their Pinot Thursdays where they do Pinot Noir tastings on the 3rd Thursday of every month.

This small neighborhood Mexican restaurant in central Phoenix offers a standard taqueria style menu with the notable addition of fry bread options. They are located on 40th & Thomas in the strip mall on the southeastern corner with the large FRYBREAD sign in the window.

I am a fry bread junkie. There is just something about a deep fried piece of warm and chewy dough surrounding sweet or savory options. I know the troubled history of the bread and its unique status among modern Native Americans, but I can still appreciate its place in modern cuisine. Maria's was listed very high on Yelp for this, and I always appreciate my Mexican food when visiting Phoenix.

The interior of the restaurant is typical of most taquerias in the Valley, but the service was especially warm and friendly. My order was taken and served quickly, with a fry bread taco with red chili beef. I was rather disappointed with the overall choice. The fry bread is more like a sopapilla lacking the chewy and pliable texture of native fry bread, but even as a sopapilla it was rather bland. The red chili beef was also rather mild compared to many other places in Phoenix.

The chips and hot sauce were as warm as the staff which was nice, but it is hard to overlook the fry bread especially since it is part of the restaurant name and advertising. The mild flavor of the red chili beef would be expected at home in Sacramento, but seems especially mild for the Phoenician palette.

Staff is so friendly here and are willing to go out of the way to help and entertain you as you get your drink on.  Our bartender made us fill laid back and at ease... Nice way to spend an afternoon.  Place is a little bare but the ease and friendliness of the staff pushed it above other places in town.  I was bummed they were out of growlers when we went but it just gave me another excuse to go back and get one another weekend.

It's also smoke-free, a rare find in the neighborhood (though there are smoking areas outside). 

The bar is owned by two brothers, and they've decorated the spot with ""Dukes of Hazzard"" lunchboxes, old records and other memorabilia from their childhood. 

Be sure to catch the owners' honkytonk band, the Loose Lugnuts, which often plays to a rowdy crowd of friends and Plaza Midwood regulars. 

The Beaver has two pool tables, but the back room is much too cramped for any serious playing.

A word of warning: The bartenders don't have much experience making complicated drinks. Stick with beer or basics like rum and coke. 

The parking situation needs some work. The adjacent gravel lot is way too tiny and people end up parking across busy Central Street. So walk or bike there if you can.",2008-09-10 23:07:19

I was immediately greeted by the front desk staff and handed an iPad to update my personal information--I found this to be convenient and a great way to utilize technology. It didn't take me long to complete it and turn it in. 
Shortly afterwards, I was called back for my exam. The young lady that led me back performed a great portion of my exam. She was professional, knowledgeable, thorough and organized. She talked with me as we were doing the exam and put me at ease. She had a lovely personality. 
After that portion was complete, she led me to another seating area where a movie was showing on the television: The Kid. I enjoyed watching it even though my eyes were dilating. 
Another young lady came and called me back to take photos of my eyes. She was professional and nice. It was quick and she led me back to the waiting area where I continued to watch the movie. I was called a short time after to come to an exam room where I waited for Dr. Coulson to come in and see me. He was the doctor I saw on my previous visit 1 1/2 years ago. 
Dr. Coulson is an outstanding eye doctor. He went over everything including my medical history. He inquired how things were going with my education and any plans I have for the summer. He is personable, knowledgeable, and has a great bedside manner. He informed me that I don't have any major problems with my eyes and my eyes are healthy. 
Afterwards I sat back in the waiting area and waited to be called for check out. The staff in the check out area were friendly and helpful. 
I like Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center and I will return on time next year for my regular diabetic eye exam. 
**I should note that both waiting areas are nice and clean with flat screen televisions and plenty of magazines to read. At the front desk check in they have bottled water for their patients arranged inside a basket.** A nice touch with how hot the temperatures have been the past 11 days.
I recommend Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center for all your eye care needs.",2017-06-28 18:40:13

Shoshito peppers, cauliflower and pistachios - nice flavors on the peppers but not as well seasoned as their other plates.
Amberjack crudo - delicious!  Fresh and tasty.  It was so good, we had to order 2 plates.
Oysters Rockefeller with foie gras - by far the best thing we ordered.  Foie was subtle and not overwhelming so you can taste the oyster.  Lots of crispy bread crumbs on top. Yum!
Beef carpaccio - underwhelming.  Not salted well enough, beef was sliced too thick and the nori Parmesan chips were not savory enough to carry the beef and mixed greens.
Spicy tuna with waffle fries - perfect!  Really hit the spot.  The fries were a nice crispiness and worked really well with the tuna.  Definitely eat this one again.
Salmon poke and beets with sweet potato chips - another home run.  Salmon and veggies were perfectly diced.  Loved it.
Fried calamari - another winner.  It's crispy, tasty, slightly spicy with nice picked pepper slices on top.
Miso Honey ice cream - a very rich, thick ice cream that's really interesting in a good way.  honey is the predominant flavor and miso is in there but if I didn't know there was miso in there, I probably couldn't pinpoint the flavor.  Like it said, interesting in a good way.

I also had my previous dentist email all my records to them. When I arrived the staff took X-rays and had me wait in the examination room.

For over an hour.

I was starting to get irritated by that point, and finally the dentist came in, though I had been expecting a hygienist since they're the ones who do cleanings. He took a look at my X-rays, and without even having seen my actual teeth pronounced that they looked great, and seemed irked when I looked like I was expecting a bit more than that.

Apparently to placate me he grabbed a tool and stabbed at my teeth a few times, jabbing me in the gums quite hard (the spot is still sore an hour later). His attitude was completely flippant, though he finally seemed to realize I was expecting a cleaning. He called in a couple of the receptionists and muttered at them for a while. Then he told me he could do a quick go-over with an electric brush, but he had another patient so didn't know how long I'd have to wait. So not only was he not willing to help me, but he had no idea how long any of his appointments might take.

I told the receptionist that I had specifically scheduled a cleaning, and she said that by law they needed to take x-rays and do an exam first.

We came and sat as the first two at the communal table, which we sat at alone and empty for about 20 minutes before it filled up. Naturally this is not the restaurants' fault, however the waitress who was also serving filled-up adjacent table, took a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge us and ask for our drinks. She came back immediate asking for our menu items as if to start the process, but then seated the remainder of the table and started the process all over again. Oh well.

The when soup and salad came as an appetizers, my friend ask specifically for no salad dressing which naturally was ignored. Meh. The chef came to cook he tried his best to do the over-the-top presentation that is expected of Hibachi, but seemed, personality wise, to either be new at it or awkward. He didn't engage with anybody until he did a party trick and then reverted back into his shell. Poor kid as he had a very heavy accent. 

This locations gives you half noodle and half rice rather than just rice, which was interested/a nice change, but the quality/proportion of them was all off. The fried rice needed another half an egg, the noodles were half crispy half not, the vegetables was practically all onion [sigh - no broccoli] and dude, what did they do with the yum yum and teriyaki sauces? somebody needs to revisit their recipe or at least buy the good brand because it was practically just mayo with some coloring.

I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons. 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets) 
   I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.  
   Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.
    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show"".",2011-03-20 22:57:56

All the previous employees at their old location are now replaced by new ones. So during my most recent visit everyone was literally walking around clueless and handing out orders to the wrong table.

My family and I always expect delicious pho from Golden Turtle but were very disappointed. It took about 20 minutes for our pho orders to come out. When it eventually came to our table all of the noodles were broken. My dad waved over an employee and all he did was awkwardly say that the kitchen staff are new. My dad replied back that this restaurant has been opened for 20+ years so this is not what returning customers expect. The owner then told her employees to send back all of our orders and make new ones. After another 5-10 minute wait we finally had the Golden Turtle pho we were expecting. We were highly unimpressed and definitely will not be visiting anytime soon.

I hope Golden Turtle steps up their game and clean their new location up because it's quite dirty. The windows and floors are not clean.

The meal includes chips and a side. I usually go for th pasta salad as it is the most filling. The flavor of the salad is bland and I usually empty half of a pepper shaker into it. 

I have tried to spice up my food with the Italian dressing that is found on each table. I found it best to turn the bottle upside down and let the oil separate out, this way you can get just spices and vinegar, it goes well on the chips.

I ordered the black bean burger with a cup of crap soup. The soup is absolutely amazing!!! Chunks of crab. This is a must order item every time. The black bean patty was nicely done and i liked that it was served on a pita, instead of a bun. Both my husband and mom ordered the chicken sandwich and enjoyed their meals. 

Service at the table was just ok. To be quite honest, it felt fairly rushed, which is a bit annoying when you wait 45 minutes. However, the guy taking names down for the wait was fantastic.

Red velvet wise, this is my favorite one! and i LOVE red velvet.

They aren't too sweet and just the right size. I think their cakes are slightly pricey, but thats just IMO. But the cakes are delicious, good texture, perfect amount of sweetness, and fresh.

Got the opportunity to try 6 different dishes because I went with another person. For those who don't know what Winterlicious is, it's an event where a set of restaurants offer special set of courses at a cheaper price than regular meals so people can try new restaurants.

I had the Winter Greens and Wheatberries with blue cheese, apples and tarragon. For my main I had the Griddled Pork Shoulder Steak with beer mustard, warm sherried lentils, collard greens, screeched prunes. Finally for dessert I had the Warm Sugar Beet and Chocolate Cake. My friend had the Curried Tamarack Pumpkin Soup, Oyster Mushroom Pizza with gouda cheese and onions, and for dessert she had the Moonshine Pannacotta.

Overall, the meals were pretty good. The pork shoulder was my favourite, not too salty and it was super tender and I loved the subtle additional flavour of the onions, mustard and the greens. The pork basically melted in your mouth. I also enjoyed the pumpkin soup because I love those vegetable thick soups because I haven't had it in a long time and reminds me of a friend who makes excellent squash soup that has almost the same texture. Finally, I enjoyed the mushroom-oyster pizza. I like how the cheese on it was gouda cheese so it was quite different from your typical pizzas and it was freshly made, the crust was thin and crispy. While the actual pizza itself was easy to cut and eat.

I'll definitely be back again to try this place again. The second O&B restaurant that I've ever been to and they don't disappoint!

Whenever we need a place in walking distance I always pick them over all the other high priced or mediocre Shadyside restaurant/bars. Their menu changes seasonally and is always hilarious (more so than Mad Mex, which they poke fun at along with other local restaurants). They're surprisingly vegetarian friendly for the amount of meat they have on their menu. I have not had anything here that wasn't delicious; favorites will come and go, but I'm a fan of their HUGE salads and the eggplant lasagna (noodle free). 

Absolutely go for brunch - Sundays 10 to 2. It will either be a buffet or a menu for a fixed price of $13. VERY meat heavy, but I'm sure there is always something veggie-friendly, but never expect vegan-friendly. They include two drinks and a fresh fruit plate - one of the drinks can be a bloody mary (which we got and regretted, it was very unpalatable) or a frozen mimosa (get that instead). 

What I really love, aside from the fantastic food, is the creative cocktails. These drinks are going to be on the $8.50 side, some are worth it and some aren't, but The $3 Frozen Cosmo happy hour is the best deal on Ellsworth. Even if you're a manly man, this very pink booze slushie is amazing. Go with a big group and ask for the lounge upstairs or a window booth.

I've been here about 5 times now, and it's always the same two people I see working it, so I guess they're the owners.  Two main things to get here are the Meat Jun and the Korean Pancake.  They're just to die for!

The Meat Jun is thinly sliced beef covered with egg that was marinated in some sauce that was very flavorful.  I really like it, get it every time.  The other thing is the Korean pancake, which is this thick, savory, egg-like combination of several different kinds of seafood.  It's wonderful, and is definitely good for two people, which is good because it costs $9.95!  

Their banchan is also pretty good, if not amazingly spectacular.  Their kimchee is good, as it should be for a Korean cornerstone, but the spicy tofu is great, and by far the best of the bunch(an) is the fish cakes!  They're thin slices of fried fish cake with sliced peppers and jalapenos.  I never leave without buying a box of them to go.  If they don't give you the fish cakes automatically, just ask, they'll be more than happy to give you a few.

They have sushi here, too, but I can't really say much good about it, except the Korean roll.  The others are basic rolls that you can actually find better elsewhere.

Mind you, we have three dogs and a 12yo. Needless to say, our carpets (being a very light color) were damn near black in some high traffic areas. 

We were talking about who to have come clean the carpets. I have used Turbo Cleaners (they did a good job but, we decided to try someone else) and ZeroRez (I was not impressed as after a week or so, it looked like the carpets hadn't been done). We found Noble Carpet Cleaners, They had stellar reviews across Yelp, FB and Google. 

We contacted Noble and received a call back from Samantha to quote me a price and give me options. Sam called me a couple of days later to schedule. We went over everything from how many rooms, pets, stains, etc. She told me she would have Gene (one of the owners) come himself and gave me a quote. Sam scheduled my appointment for the next morning with a two hour window. The day of service, 12-20-2016, I received a reminder text then an update stating Gene was on his way. Terry showed up shortly before Gene. They were very professional and clean in appearance. They came in and prepped the house sprayed the stains and went to work. 

Our carpet is pretty much finished due to the dogs tearing holes when they were pups, peeing now that they're seniors and the discoloration of 8 years of abuse. We intend to replace it but, for now cleaning was a must. Gene and Terry were meticulous and methodical. They were here several hours cleaning 4br, an office, a living room, a sitting room, a loft and a staircase. Throughout, Gene would explain certain areas and the reality of being unable to get the color back simply due to damage. I expected that. What I didn't expect was the end result. Most of the high traffic areas were returned to a color close to original. These areas were almost black when Gene started. The rest of our carpet looked like new. 

Gene and Terry finished up and asked me to come outside. I went to the van and saw the amount of dog hair and debris Gene got out of the carpets and the water residue (which looked like raw sewage) from cleaning. I really was disgusted by the image however, very relieved and surprised at the magic Noble Cleaners was able to work to clean our carpets. We would recommend Noble for your cleaning needs. We will definitely have them back to do the tile and whatever we replace the carpet with in the future. Prices are very reasonable, customer service and communication is outstanding, timeliness is on point and services are amazing. The entire process was seamless. 

We paid Gene in cash based on what Sam quoted us. No up-sells or add-ons. Gene and Terry left. We received a call shortly after from them asking if we intended to give them what we did or if it was a mistake. I laughed and told them the extra was in fact for them. The honesty and integrity that act displayed speaks volumes about their character.

i had a greay deal about this restaurant and have been wanting to check it out for a while - and we finally did.

The food was delicious, the ambience is nice and the staff was friendly as well.

Food:
(a) Appetizers:
- we had the dahi vaada and chaat for starters - was good but a little disapointing - i was hoping for more chaat style - the combination of the two dishes in one was a little weird. Both dahi vaada or chaat would've tasted better as separate dishes
- kebab platter  - the chicken tikkas were so tender and delicious! The fish was fantastic as well. Would've been satisfied with anothe round of the platter

(b) Entrees
- daal panchtaran - a mix of 5 yellow and orange daals - ti was good but not my favourite entree that we tried.
- Chicken Tikka masala was very flavourful! 
- Diawli Special - the lamb dish was AMAZING!! THE best Indian lamb dishes i have EVER had. I wish this was on their regular dinner menu

(c) Dessert
-Kulfi - tasted great and the presentation was fantastic!!

She took our drink orders, water for me and a Dos XX for my hubby with a lime. We also ordered the nachos, jalapenos and pico de gallo on the side. She didn't write it down and my husband said, our order was going to be wrong (I hate when he's right). She finally came back with our drinks, maybe 5 small ice cubes in each water glass (no joke) and a nice warm beer with no lime to go with it. My husband was going to ask for a new beer, but she never stopped by until the nachos arrived. Hubby was right, jalapenos were on the nachos and she said she told them jalapenos on the side. Now, she could have done 2 things, she could have told us what happened  before bringing them out and ask us if we still wanted them or she could have said, ""I saw that there were jalapenos on them so, I asked them to make a new one.""  Did not do either one. Food arrived, she didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask for them.

The restaurant was also disgustingly dirty. Tables that weren't cleaned from prior guests, floors filled with food and crap. It wasn't even that busy. The sad part was, the nice hostess was the one cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor, re-arranging the tables, AND seating people. All this time, she still had a smile on her face. We decided to tip the hostess since she was actually pleasant and was going above and beyond to keep the restaurant presentable.

The space is awesome to take in, with the octopus theme running wild. Adventurous concept, visually,  and just over-the-top enough to be a talking point, while never interfering with the experience. It's dark, so expect to bring a light for the menu.

The food was excellent. We had the Al Pastor, Bistec, Tako, and Carnitas tacos. All good, with my only exception being the thick and hard-to-get-through octopus on the Tako taco. Curious if I'll be the only one to make suggestions to the manager on that one. Flavor-wise, it was good. Just texture wasn't ideal. Otherwise, food was spot-on. I'd recommend it all!

I love Indian food because it can offer some of the most delicious guiltless meat-free meal options (which carnivores like myself often appreciate), which is why I was shocked at the overwhelmingly meat-based entrees here. My old favorites like palak paneer or malai kofta were replaced by seabass or duck-confit. I was so thrown off that I actually checked to make sure that I indeed entered the correct restaurant. It is nice to see modern interpretations of Indian food, but I was not prepared to drop $20+ on unfamiliar dishes using ingredients that I have never seen in Indian restaurants before. Perhaps they should consider expanding the more 'traditional' menu items. 

I ended up getting the samosas, garlic naan, and tikki masala (as I do not eat seafood, which eliminates a chunk of the menu). The portions made be feel like a child again, due to their size.

I would say if you order prime rib at another restaurant, you would get about 10-12 oz for the smallest dinner cut.  So, for the prices, I thought they were small.

I piggy backed off my hubby's meal and got the lobster tail add-on for $15.  It was good, but slightly overcooked and small.  I also got a side of the creamed corn which was the bomb!  I tried my hubby's prime rib and it was really good as well as the potatoes and gravy.

Now, comes the best part.  Since I ate light, I splurged for the mango mojito which was great and then the sticky toffee pudding with whipped cream & ice cream.  Hubby got the chocolate cake.  Wouldn't order the cake again...the frosting between layers and on top was hard like a candy bar...no creamy frosting on this anywhere.  But my pudding...holy freakin cow!  It tastes exactly like a dessert my mother used to make that my hubby and I love.  This was just as good and we moaned through every bite!

All in all, we would go back sometime.  Not cheap, but great food.  The service was really great all evening.",2017-10-26 21:16:17

 Looking at vintage pictures of The Plaza, I get really saddened by the way old glamour wore off over the years and got clumsily updated and patched up on a shoe string budget. 
 There are some properties that do it right and manage to revitalize their appeal to keep up with the times, unfortunately, Plaza isn't one of them. 
 From burnt out bulbs in their sign, to gaudy TV screen slapped in the middle of the hotel tower, to tarped off tennis and basketball court, a pool area that is little more than cement hole- lots of examples of underutilized potential. 
 The lobby areas got a nice face lift, as did bathroom fixtures in the rooms, but that poor pool was clearly a victim of budgeting prioritization.
 Now I didn't encounter any weird smells or bed bugs, it was clean enough, but we did have a lot of drama with keys that caused us back and forth walking and longer than necessary waiting outside the room to be told the issue is either dead battery OR we demagnetized the keys. With the cell phone. If such a thing is possible, a warning upon check in, something like ""hold your phone in hand opposite one holding key"" would be great.
Then there are pool operating hours. It closes at 5. Check in starts at 4. There is a line. By the time all is said and done, it's pushing quarter till and oh yes, a security guard comes down at 5:20 informing patrons that ""pool closed at FIVE"". Great, thanks. So unless you are staying more than one night, you might as well book a property without the pool. They have a bar area, but I wonder when it's open for business, if ever.
 Location puts you at the less hip and cool end of Freemont st, but conveniently close to a number of downtown properties and attractions, plus you get a great view of the Smith's Center. 
 Dining options are cool, I don't like Hash House, but many do. There's Oscar's for upscale experience, Bier Garten for gourmet franks and craft brews, a Mexican Cantina and McDonald's.

1) Mussels Galo: Very plumped and great with the wine sauce. Definitely different from other places. 

2) Crab Cake- It was one hockey size cake, because its filled with blue crab meat, they only give one, compared to two or three in most restaurants. 

3) Fresh sea urchin with dried lotus roots which was on their special apps that day...pretty good too $10 for 3 pieces! 

4) Smoked salmon with capers and arugula salad...pretty good as well. 

5) A dozen fanny bay oysters!!! Fresh as it can be...

Main meals ordered: 1) Seafood mixed grill-$31 (Scallops-good size, Shrimps-good size, 5oz salmon, and potato william (croquette style). This dish was quite worth it, you get 3 scallops/shrimps with good size fish.

2) Tuna Nicoise- Pretty good size as well. Good deal for $24 a plate.

3) Sea Breem- fish dish for $23 good deal...but watch out for bones...quite a bit.

The mussels were pretty good, I ordered another one since the apps  range from $10 and a bit more...

Friday morning after a night of obliteration in the town, I wanted to eat something fresh and healthy. Naturally I opened up my handy dandy yelp bookmarks to find a new spot to try! Came across hummus! Was amped about going for Mediterranean as I love the spices that Mediterranean food consists of. 

This joint is another chipotle for Mediterranean food! You pick your base, your toppings, your meat, your sauce etc! I came for a salad and got hardly any salad. My bowl was thoroughly and unequivocally wet from the hummus they spread around the bowl. Mind you, it wasn't wet from dressing! I got the dressing on the side! I was dying for something healthy, light, and refreshing! 

Unfortunately for me, the wetness ruined my entire bowl! Wasn't for me! Maybe the next time, if I return, I'll probably do the hummus on the side???

I went again last night for my birthday and had a fantastic meal. The chips that come out when you sit down are warm and fresh and super crispy and they are probably the best chips I have ever had in a restaurant. The salsa is so good and has a really nice kick of spicy that I love. The drinks are super strong, I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, which I like because I don't drink often (in fact the last time I drank was the last time I was at Fuego Tacos) but when I do drink I want to feel buzzed and these drinks will get you there about halfway through one drink. Either that or I am a super lightweight. The specialty drinks on the menu are $5, but I guess custom drink orders not on the menu are a bit more because my Long Island was $7. Beer I think is $4. 

I ordered the spicy vegetable tacos again but this time with soft shells, and they were much better. I didn't even finish them this time because I was so full. I also got a full plate of black beans again. They make me happy. My husband got the shrimp tacos and he liked them much better than the fish tacos he got last time.

We ARE awesome pet parents!! The place is pretty huge and Tatum was thrilled. Lots of space for her to run and since we were all the way in Gilbert, as opposed to our normal Scottsdale stomping grounds, she was meeting all sorts of new pups.

We were really interested to see if Tatum would be interested in the water side of it. The only time she's gone in water was when she was running after a gaggle of geese at Roadrunner Park and lost track of the direction they were escaping to. Turns out, she doesn't mind getting wet up to her chest, but THAT'S IT. We lost a ball to the deep end during her test of endurance. Live and learn.

There were some serious water dogs out there though. Very cool to watch how eagerly they run off the pseudo-pier after the floaty toys their owners toss in. We also enjoyed the stairs and catwalk that the dogs could walk up, across, and down on.

Driving into the Summerlin area and down Blue Diamond Highway into the Red Rock area you are suddenly greeted by massive red and beige rock mountains that shoot high up into the blue desert skies, seeming unreal or something you'd see in an old western painting. 
Entering the park you pay $7 a car and can park up at the Conservation Center that allows one to peek into the life of the Red Rock inhabitants. Hawks, desert iguanas, rattlesnakes, scorpions, desert tortoises are on display along with desert landscape and environmental facts. They have a nice gift shop should you want purchase a Red Rock hat or shirt, a cactus plant or a Native American replica. 
Now, it gets really good once you begin one of the many hikes. From easy to advanced, 2-3.5 hour hikes are there for your adventure. 
Drive up through the scenic route, which is 13 miles, you have the opportunity to stop a few times to get out and explore or take pictures. 
The landscape along that 13 mile road changes also, from jutting, striated cliffs and enormous boulders resting precariously upon another, inviting you to come take a look around, loads of crevasses and small caves lay awaiting to be explored.

We were wheeling my 96 year old dad through Southpark Mall and he complained about a torn thumb nail.  The nail needed to be trimmed and filed.

Passing Avalon, I went inside and explained my father's nail condition, asking if they would do a one nail job.  Reluctantly, the older woman scowled a yes and said, ""One dollar.""  And then assigned one of the young women the task.

OK...I went outside, got my dad out of the wheel chair and, holding his arm, brought him inside.  

The staff reaction was immediate.  The designated woman indicated, graciously, a seat and returned with a sterile pack of instruments.  She studied the nail, clipped and filed it to perfection.  

As I reached for my wallet she said, ""No charge.""  But I gave her two dollars ""for luck,"" thanked her, nodded to the old lady and helped my dad out.

I was very favorable impressed with their courtesy, the sanitized pack of instruments, the cleanliness of the interior, the nice tables, dryers and foot soak-er chairs and especially with their courtesy and considerations.

I personally enjoy supporting local establishments and so, I was very stoked we finally made it in. I LOVE veggies! I mean, it's apparent at this point through life that I only eat meat when I'm craving it. So, I've tried a whole heck of a lot of veggie burgers and mushroom burgers. I am never quite sure what to expect and though there are a few joints that have a decent ""veggie"" burger many of them never have exactly what I'm looking for. Up until this point there has  been no mushroom burger that I would order again, anywhere... Typically, if I'm paying attention and see the veggie burger is a Portobello burger or Boca burger, I will change my order....Until now.

There is an awesome outdoor seating area and though it was pretty busy, we sat inside, it seemed like a pleasant spot to enjoy a meal. I went with the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich with side beets and a strawberry lemonade. Holy moly! The first bite of my burger was exceedingly impressive. I could tell the mushroom was marinated or something because it was packed full of flavor rather than just a plain bland mushroom on a  bun. The bun itself was obviously fresh and delicious as well. I'm not sure one can go wrong with a side of beets and they were just that, fresh beets. The lemonade was in high demand and that was really the only thing I ended up waiting for.

I would absolutely go back to Joe's. In fact, I look forward to our next meal there and an opportunity to try some other menu items, although, the mushroom sandwich alone would bring me back again.

Once I was seated I had to wait for about 10 minutes before my waitress came around to even take my drink order. I knew she was very busy, so I just ordered a water. Once she came back with my drink and brought me some bread, she took off again to tend to more tables. After about another 10 minutes she came back and took my food order. I got the Fettuccine Alfredo. Delicious, but cost $17 which to me wasn't worth it as it was just basic and nothing special about it. I could have made it at home for way less. 

Other than the food, my experience wasn't the best. The place was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. There were screaming kids, pots and pans banging around in the kitchen and just your average noise of people talking in a crowded space.

When you go in, there are quite a few bags that you can choose from for your main ingredient (turkey, roast beef, chicken, etc) and then you can select as many or as few toppings as you'd like. It gets really busy at lunch time so you'll probably find yourself waiting for quite a while, unless you order ahead online.

The only thing I've noticed is the inconsistency of their sandwiches - sometimes I'll get a huge sandwich because whoever made it was very generous with the toppings I have chose & other times, I'll get a much smaller sandwich because there are barely any toppings. At times, the ingredients seem really fresh and other times they don't (specifically the lettuce so I've now stopped getting that & get spinach instead).

I'd say that even so, the sandwiches are fairly priced. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get a free bag of chips. They recently changed their rewards so there's no longer a punch card but rather, you get points depending on the menu item. Give them a try!",2015-10-19 02:47:11

Very difficult to find the place but the best description I can give is to look for the office building with greenish tinted windows that has ""100 York""  labeled on the building.

The atmosphere is more targeting teens and the younger crowed with menus that look more like a child's story book. Its weird see men in suit and tie holding what looks like a child's menu. If I was opening a cafe in this area I would probably be targeting the many office workers in the area. But I guess it gets most of its business from the younger crowed during the night since its been around for so long.

Large Macchiatto $6 - WARNING - wait for it to cool down or sip very slowly or else you might get burned like I did. The drink is topped with cool whip cream so when the scolding hot drink hits your lips its a painful surprise. The drink itself is sweet and pretty good.

Large Cappuccino $5 - lots of foam on top, pretty decent flavour.

Also got a slice of cake called the Cherry Potter for $8.50 - probably the most expensive slice of cake I have ever purchased. Fell way short of expectations. It was basically a New York cheese cake with apple crumble and cherries. The syrup sauce from the cherries were over powering and really didn't taste really good and ruined the cheese cake itself.

   I have always appreciated and been a supporter of the AGO. I love art, I love museums and the AGO holds a special place in my heart and has for many years. I had a strong attachment to the old art gallery, but am happy to say that the new AGO is wonderful! 
  
  Famed Canadian architect Frank Gehry was to completely change the face of our art gallery, and he did so in several ways. The entrance has a much grander feel to it now than in the past. You enter from Dundas now and the curators galore are more than esteemed to help guide you inside. People were milling about everywhere and I kind of felt like a kid in a candy store; I was excited to be there, but I didn't really know where to start!

  Upon entering, you'll notice the huge gift shop to your left and washrooms/coat check/etc to your right. In front, are a number of stair cases and one very windy ramp presumably for people with wheelchairs.

  (side note, any one can use it, of course. To elaborate on the windiness and length of this ramp I learned that night that it was a sound architectural decision made to make the ramp this way due to the degree of incline required to make it firstly, up to code and secondly, for function-for those with wheelchairs to be able to go from level one to level two at the entrance....just in case you were wondering why it's so windy. Of course, function is only part of this design).

  There are several new rooms and each has a collection to discover. One of my favourites was the room with the stair case that allowed you to see the art from ground level and then from above, as if in a grand hall or living room. The Canadian collections are all still present and there are several new additions and themed rooms.

  There are 5 floors, two of which hold art, and the other three floors are used for shows, events and /or galas. There is also a new restaurant attached to the gift shop and all in all, the feel of the AGO is the essence of grandeur. 

 What most people will notice is the outside transformation. The wooden and glass reno is a true work of art all to itself. It exemplifies what an art gallery should look like. Inside, looking out to Dundas, you are surrounded by gigantic wooden beams and panels, floor to ceiling length. I learned that no two beams in the entire renovation are the same, which is quite remarkable on its own, and as an architectural feat. 

  I felt like I was inside an ark or a wooden vessel of some kind. It was amazing to watch the other people there and how mesmerized they were by the new AGO. It is this building that can give Toronto a rank as a world-class city. As I walked through the rooms of the AGO I couldn't help but think that if only we invested more effort into making our city as compelling as the AGO. Looking and being immersed in such beautiful works of art made me wonder why we can't take pride in all of our buildings in this city. The AGO is really spectacular.

 Last thing to mention; the price for adults is $18. Wednesday nights are free from 6-8:30 and the AGO is closed on Mondays..

Having spent a month exploring the museums in DC (Smithsonian Museum of Contemporary Art!), as well as having frequented the MOMA and the Art Institute of Chicago.... I wondered, could this random art museum in the middle of Case's campus live up to its hype?

And yes, it did. 

Minus the tour ladies who thought my parents and I were foreigners and tried handing us brochures in Japanese (one of them actually pointed to us and said, ""here, maybe this will help!"" while holding the brochure), and kept telling us about the Asian art exhibit (good grief, stop already!), this museum was great.

Sure, it's not as big as most art museums. But honestly, I liked its size. I always hate weaving in and out of people in museums like the Smithsonian, b/c it's always a madhouse- kids screaming, ppl be annoying and not knowing how to look at art, etc etc, but in the CMA, you can actually just walk around and look at the art- without having to go through some strategic path to get to the actual piece of art.

Contemporary, French, Medieval, they got it all. I was pleasantly surprised to see Degas, Monet, Picasso, Georgia O'Keefe, and Rodin sculptures around the museum. I definitely did a double take with a - ""wha???? this is in CLEVELAND?!!"" :)

I went in on Thursday night looking for a specific type of Christian Cross wedding band. They listened to me and we looked through some catalogs. David took over and we found a wedding band that would work. David said he had to check with the vendor and get back to me via phone in 48hrs. The call never came.

The band I was looking at was about $210.00 so I understand his commission would be low. When I came back to check on the ring, this time with my fiancée, neither of them remembered me. (This was 4 days later.) I showed them the business card David gave me with their names on it, told them I never heard back and wanted to know what the deal was.

Cheryl called the vendor and forgot what ring we were looking at. I showed her on the back of the business card - where David had written it down. Cheryl said that though Kay designed the ring, the vendor couldn't make it. I asked them why and she said, ""it's complicated - sometimes that happens."" I thanked her and David, then mentioned the fact they wasted 4 days of my time. Neither of them seemed to care.

So the $210.00 wedding band I wanted could have generated them about $15,000.00 in sales over the next 5 to 10 years. They may not have cared. I will never return unless they give me money to shop there.

If they didn't care about serving my needs at $210.00 - they sure as hell do NOT deserve the Blessings of additional sales commissions off of $15,000.00. Let this be a lesson to all Customer Service and Sales people on Yelp and beyond: serve your customers and they will form a relationship with you that may really pay off in the future.

I recommend you go to Jared - it is a couple doors down. See my Yelp review of it. Those people took EXCELLENT care of us!

So a miserable 2 stars for this Kay location for this time period.",2015-01-19 21:56:57

For desert we had the flourless chocolate cake with spumoni - an interesting combination.  The flour less cake was like a brownie and it was okay.  The spumoni was very good.

All in all we enjoyed the meal, however I don't think the quality or quantity overall measures up to the prices.  Just the same, we'll probably go back - those ravioli were really good!

There was a lot of excess tortilla that I ended up ripping off. Would recommend either using a smaller tortilla or at a little more filling given the burrito was fairly small for the price. The chips and guacamole were a little different then other restaurants I've ordered from. I received a to go box filled with chips that were already topped with guacamole. I was expecting a cup filled with guac as it was a to go order. Don't get me wrong it was good but made it very hard to eat given the guac was more runny then traditional guacamole that I was used to. Also, the bottom chips didn't have anything on them.

I ordered the Kao Soi. They also serve this at Rai Lay, their sister restaurant. Everyone at the table wished they had ordered my dish. It's their signature, and it's fantastic! We've had this dish in Northern Thailand where it originated and there's is just as good. 

My friends ordered their pork ramen. They said it was good, but said it didn't have the depth of flavor of the kao soi.

This brewery is across the street from one of the best breweries in Charlotte, Triple C. The bad thing, parking is now terrible around here. I drove around a lot before finally deciding reluctantly to part in front of one of the buildings that didn't have a sign saying they would tow your car away. My suggestion, since this brewery is located right next to a light rail station, is park in the train lot and right the train here. 
This place was absolutely packed when we arrived around 5 pm. I'm amazed that there are that many people available! given the number of breweries. I think because they have a great food option as well, it makes this place like a super brewery. They have a large outside area and a large inside area. I think they kick people out of the inside tables around 5 pm and it begins to be used exclusively for sit down table service. We got on a waiting list and it took about 45 minutes to get a table, fortunately, we got an outside table. Less noisy and the weather was really nice. They also have an outside tap area, so you can get a beer outside, and sit at the outside picnic tables and avoid the crowded inside area.
They weren't brewing their own beer yet when we went there, so have to wait on that. They had lots of other local craft options and a full bar service. 
This remains me a of a wicked weed style place. A little higher end business feel, with lots of beer and food options. Its not your typical brewery feel. Its good, and will always be packed I think because it offers so much, but it doesn't really have a brewery feel either.

We didn't have the funds or clothing to eat at a fancy-fancy restaurant.  We were towards the end of the strip, so decided to try out Kahunaville in TI.  It's a little hidden in the resort, but not too hard to find.

I had the Pirate's Booty drink to start.  Loved it- it was light and refreshing and not super sweet.  After having a LAAAARGE Pina Colada earlier, it was a nice change.  

To eat, I had the fish tacos and husband had the Dude burger.  I was a fan of the fish tacos- the sriracha aoli was a tasty addition and I liked that it came with sour cream on the side to balance out the heat.  Husband liked his burger as well, came cooked just as he specified (medium).  I really liked his fries, they were nice thin ones, seasoned well.

My biggest disappointment was that we didn't see any flair bartending.  Maybe we were there too early (7 PM)?  Also, was not aware there was a dinner show at the restaurant and was not asked if we wanted to go to it.

Service was okay.  Little on the slow, unattentive side and it was not busy in there.  We were not asked if we wanted an appetizer or dessert.

Burgatory, by contrast, embraces customization to the extreme with cute build-your-own sheets that you can fill out with a pencil. Gotta love that.

They have almost everything you could ever want on a burger (except brie...hint hint). Be careful not to get overzealous with your toppings though, or it will be impossible to eat. Just definitely add their truffle-shallot aioli because it's easily the best thing on that list. And they definitely put BRGR's fries to shame, although if you decide not to upgrade and stick with their homemade chips, you won't be disappointed either.

What you may be disappointed in is their idiotic doneness scale that goes by color. I like my burgers rare, so of course I circle ""Red."" That usually gives me about a medium, a little less than medium if I'm lucky. I get that they're trying to be quirky, but there's a reason the current doneness scale exists--it allows customers to order their meat at a specific temperature, yielding consistent results no matter where they eat. Well, in theory anyway...we all know this isn't true in practice, so why does Burgatory feel the need to complicate things further by making us learn a new scale that, based on my experiences, doesn't even go as raw as I'd like? The always overcooked burgers are what makes this place not my favorite, but since you can cover them with a ridiculous amount of toppings, it's not the worst thing ever. And of course if you like your burgers medium to well done, you'll be happy.

The boozy milkshakes are pretty great, and again, way better than BRGR's. I love the Bacon-Apple-Pancake, but it's literally a meal in and of itself. I wouldn't attempt this with a burger and fries again, unless I had the sudden urge to go into cardiac arrest. The best thing to do is to come with a friend and split one of the shakes, that way you'll still have room for the real food!

So I know a lot of people are in love with Burgatory, but I'm not about to marry it. I'm already in a committed relationship with Winghart's, but I have to admit I'll sneak away for a hookup with Burgatory every once in a while. Shhh...don't tell!",2011-07-30 06:01:21

It's a nice cozy spot in the heart of the outlet mall shopping center.

We also tried the solarita, and blackberry margarita, the black diamond margarita hands down was the best.

Everything about this place was perfect. My only complaint would be the prices. Again usually generally Mexican restaurants are generally cheaper never should you leave out of a Mexican restaurant and spend $70 alone on drinks when you didn't have many to begin with. I was looking for that traditional margarita glass vs the cutesy rimmed glasses that have you asking for another drink and find yourself spending tons on drinks alone. So i couldn't decide what i wanted when i arrived so i asked the opinions of the waitresses i asked them both if your establishment were up to win an award and you had to cook your best dish that could win you that award what would you choose?

My less than one year old daughter loves their ox-tail big bone soup broth with rice.  My mom likes their veggie pho but always says she wishes that it had more asian veggies in it. We all liked the pork belly buns and fried chicken wings that you'll find on the happy hour menu. I had the pho tai. It was just what I needed.  Service was awesome.  We ordered a few drinks, a sake bomb and a donkey...one of an asian variety seeing as though it came with some lychee in it. Yum!!! I love FRESH lychee!! We spent about $100 for dinner, for the 3 of us. We tried so many things and made a night of it, really. Goodness, I cannot tell you how wonderful the service was.  The probably 8 or so different servers that came to check on us were so fantastic. We never had to search for them. They anticipated some of our needs. They watched to see if my lil one needed anything, aside from a change of clothes because she wanted to swim in the big bone soup broth because it was so good. LOL. This was definitely a unique dining experience, drinking a donkey, slurping out bone marrow, and waving our hands around because the wings were so hot. It was a fun time. And again, service was impeccable! The happy hour menu is a great deal. I hope more people will come in for happy hour. I'm sure you won't leave UNhappy!

They did a fantastic job.  Brian and Chelsea were extremely helpful.  They took the time to help explain the different types of tint (ceramic vs regular) and the various different type of density.  It made the selection pretty easy.  

Because of the heat in Vegas, we decided to go with the ceramic tint with 15% density.  We had all the windows (sides and back tinted at 15%).  On the front, we tinted a lighter shade (Boy, was this a great decision!!).  The job was done quickly and professionally (1.5 hours).  After 4 weeks, everything looks great!

Granted, it is still late April, but, we can definitely ""feel"" that the temperature within our car cabin is much cooler.  

We would highly recommend Precision Window Tint to anyone!

I knew all the bartenders and would come for every Pens game or football game. One main reason I would frequent so often was because it was my hangout where everyone knows your name and I wanted to catch the Hockey players when they were out. OK I was a little star struck but it wears off!

This bar was voted best college bar and sports bar of 2010 so I think that says a lot. Last year I was in party mode and if you are into that scene here is where the meat market takes place. Jocks and those chasing jocks from neighboring colleges pretty much live here. It is a busy bar almost any night of the week so if you want to be immersed in a crowd and you have someone visiting from out of town bring them here instead of some dead dive bar.

I believe that Mario Lemieux owns this bar so it is decorated in player Jerseys and sports memorabilia. The space is big so you will always have a view of the game no matter where you are. TVs are all over. I prefer to sit at the bar but if you want to do that, get there a little earlier, very early if you are planning for playoffs. They have tots! I love tater tots and they've got em' yumm. They also have many more apps and bar food. I don't consider it to be fine dining it's comfort food that tastes good with beers. Goblet night, $2 beers during game time, trivia, random goof off night, tasty shooters(blue sweet tarts)...those are the things that make Mario's shine.

El Cortez and Railroad Pass are the two casinos in the valley that will give you a chance even if you are fat, ugly, and just generally unattractive. Las Vegas is a very unfair place like that. A cute girl can walk into a casino, have no experience dealing yet they will hire her at places like Red Rock Station even though she doesn't even know how to calculate the pay-outs. So perhaps we should appreciate El Cortez for being one of the only true equal opportunity employers. 

Well, El Cortez has a lot of newbie dealers. Years ago when I was a tourist, I remember the dealer paying me 3 times for hands that I lost. I just sat there and stayed quiet.  

Not to mention that they are generous on comps, and the rooms are old but very big an comfortable.   

The food at the 24 hour cafe is usually free, so I don't care if it didn't taste good. The service though is excellent.

They send you free slot play. Sometimes they are very generous. Back when I was a tourist, I threw around some green chips at the Black Jack table and they gave me $50 free slot play for a couple of months. While playing Triple Wild Cherry with my free slot play, I ended up winning $900. 

The coolest thing is that they give you comp dollars while you are using your free slot play! No other casino in the world does that.

Along with the meal, there's a couple banchan (side dishes), which were pickled daichon, kimchi, and fried hot dog pieces. All of these were well made as well.

In terms of the service, it was as if I was at my aunt or grandma's house... we were hooked up with an extra dumpling on the manju plate to make sure that each person had an equal number of dumplings at our table. When our water ran out, we were given bottled water at no charge. Also, our Hawaiian Sun drink was on the house. The owner also gave us a sample of the saipan noodle soup, which was delicious and contained no oil whatsover, a rarity these days. At the end of the meal, we were given hot tea on the house as well in to-go cups. Can't say enough about the treatment of customers here. Amazing.",2012-06-02 04:27:50

On a Saturday, I went in for a little snack to go.  I wanted to check out their Siu Mai (pork dumplings and shrimp) and their potstickers.  Both were amazing.  My wife and kids and I gobbled it up.  The Siu Mai had a balanced seafood and pork flavor.  The potstickers (pork and vegetable) were a perfect crispy texture but not dripping with oil and incredibly tasty.

So, on Monday, we ventured back but went for a sit down meal.  Here's what we ended up with:
Pork Soup Dumplings ($9)
Pork and Vegetable Potstickers ($8)
Vegetable Dumplings ($9)
Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Wontons - Szechuan Style ($6)
Taiwanese Style Sesame Cold Noodles - ($6)
Side of steamed rice - ($2)

I thought the veggie dumplings were just meh.  But everything else was just perfect.  Be sure to try the pork soup dumplings and their potstickers!  A real surprise was the Taiwanese sesame cold noodles.  I liked the peanut and vinegar balance.  It's not for everyone but I really enjoyed it.

We finished up at $52 with drinks, tax and tip.

Service was friendly and attentive.  We were seated in a long bench facing where the dumplings were being made.  Talk about dinner and a show!  This was a ton of fun for the kids and our whole family ate well.  Can't wait to be back again!

The meatballs are made fresh there. The meat taste fresh and the combination of the meat and sauces were on point!

For the pizza, we got the farmhouse, bianca and the calabrese. All three are very good! All I could say is go there and try it, you will not be disappointed. They even sell pizza by the slice. They have a little spot to the left of the restaurant were you can order by the slice.

I also recommend the sweet & sour sauce chicken which you can request to have a little but of spice (which I highly recommend if you're a spice lover). If you want to be really unhealthy but drool over crispy-ness of chicken, order a side of chicken skin! The 3 flavours I had mentioned are really good. Though I'm not a fan of green onions, there is an option to get crispy chicken with green onions (and has no bones).

And if you don't like that... well, there's really no one you can blame but yourself then. I usually go with salmon as my protein. I have to echo fellow Nikki W's comment... get it with pesto. (And yes, there are two Nikki W's. Watch out Charlotte)

Salads come with a crostini. I usually get a cup of soup with my salad so I can dunk this toasted crouton into it. My orders are usually enough to make two meals. Leftovers rule!

I go to yoga. For any of you that know me, you know I go a lot. After evening classes, I'm usually wiped out and a hot, sweaty mess. This place is so convenient to pop in and grab a salad or sandwich to go.

This location also has some pizzas on the menu. I haven't tried those yet. I can't bring myself to order a pizza at a salad place.

Only small problem is the parking situation in this area. Make sure you pay attention to where you are parking and obey all the signs. They do boot cars if you park in the wrong spot. You have been warned.",2014-05-29 19:24:11

I arrived about 5:15 and was seated in a rather empty restaurant except for a private party in one room.  I was seated immediately and my server, Mike, came over and ask for drink order and let me know if I had any questions about the menu to ask.  He got my iced tea.

I ordered a cup of black bean soup and the coconut shrimp.  The bean soup was brought in a short time drizzled with a back and forth with a cilantro-crema.  The crema didn't really give the soup any flavor.  It seems it was more decorative than functional. 

The main course--coconut shrimp--was brought with the correct amount of break between appetizer and main.  The shrimp were good and it had been quite awhile since I had coconut shrimp which I like.  It was served broccoli and yellow rice.  The shrimp were good but I think it would be better as an appetizer than a main.  

For dessert, I got the chocolate island, a dessert the menu describes as ""rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie island in chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise.""  It was a very good dessert and the best part of the meal.

Mike's service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.

We pulled in and attempted to Gas up at the pumps. Our credit card said 'declined' and to complete the transaction with the cashier. We walked inside and explained to the cashier the pump did not accept our credit card. The cashier attempted to complete our transaction which was met with negative results. As we were waiting for the cashier to figure out what was going on we received a call from the fraud Dept. of our Bank who wanted to verify that we were out of State and were in fact the ones attempting to use the credit card at this Gas Station. 

We had hoped this would resolve the issue and allow us now to use our credit card, wrong answer. So we decided to pay with cash ' We told the cashier $40.00 on Pump 13,' the cashier did not understand, we told the cashier again and again and again, no joke. We had people behind us in line rolling their eyes probably saying to themselves 'These darn Californians.'

It was obvious that this was an ESL (English second Language) type of deal. I mean who am I to complain the cashiers English was better than my attempt at whatever the cashiers 1st language was. 

It was just a hassle, you have been on the road for several hours and all you want to do is be there and you are being held up at the last moment because of a computer glitch and/or the cashier losing '$40.00 on pump 13' somewhere in translation. 

I will say the gas prices based on what was available in the middle of the desert were about $1.00 cheaper here, we are talking California to Nevada prices. With that being said I can also say that there are plenty of other Gas Stations in the area with just about the same prices and there in the land of 'Odds' there is zero chance I ever come back here.",2013-04-12 17:57:52
O8dO4QxUlt1mwUO_h6CYSg,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,xlMgaPOpd_99SFTuOtDH0A,5,2,0,1,"All throughout 2014, I kept hearing and reading great things about a new restaurant in the relatively obscure Mile-Ex neighbourhood - at least from a food perspective. A place that was doing some unique things in terms of local foraging and doing it in a cool setting. All of this talk made restaurant Manitoba one of the hit newcomers in 2014 and a place I dearly wanted to try out. After many months, I finally decided that I really needed to go before the summer was over so I made it a date night and brought my girlfriend along for what I hoped would a great experience for both me and her of course.

Located in the old industrial neighbourhood of Mile-Ex - stuck in the middle of Little Italy and Parc Extension, Manitoba is very unassuming as you approach - simply a wood terrasse in front of a simple door and window. Once you enter, it is truly a space in keeping with its neighbourhood and its approach of food - Industrial and clean but with touches of nature. A gorgeous bar along the left side of the room all the way to the open kitchen. The use of wood trunks on the ceiling with the light coming through them. The all-black wall and blackboard menu. The back garden and terrasse space with patio lights all a-glow. The vibe is hip and cool.

Service is attentive and friendly. It is surprising how I froze up at simply being asked if I'd had a nice day - not exactly what you expect from your waiter. Even the chefs were chatty and friendly as one of the sous-chef kindly answered our questions about some of the plants and herbs they use that we didn't know too well. We did have a bit of an issue with the service of our cocktails - way too long between the order and arrival of them - but otherwise great all around from the staff. 

After a quick discussion with our waiter, we decided to start with the deer heart gravlax served with cauliflower puree, corn, sunflower seeds, labrador tea oil and stonecrop. What an awesome way to start a meal. The rich gaminess of the deer heart was not lost in the gravlax process. Add the creaminess of the puree, the sweetness of the corn and the little crunch from the seeds and this was a great balanced dish.

As a main dish, my girlfriend opted for the scallops from iles-de-la-madeleine served with lobster mushrooms, salicornia, green pea puree and emulsion. The scallops were nicely sized and wonderfully fresh with a beautiful sear all around. The beautiful lobster mushrooms brought a nice contrast to that freshness with their earthy tones. I was also very intrigued about the green pea puree and emulsion. An interesting bite of technique that maintained a strong pea flavour. Very good all around.

In my case, I decided to order something I had never had before: Maple brulé bone marrow served with chokeberry, maïtake, swiss chard and toast. From my vantage point watching the chefs use a blowtorch to burn the maple sugar made me pine for this dish pretty quickly. Bone marrow was something I suspected I would enjoy and yeah... turns out I was right. Definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea but dear god did I love this. Rich and fatty with a great sweetness and crunch from the maple syrup, I could have had many many more. The chokeberry mixture on top added some tartness and then add in some wonderful toast to put the whole mixture on top of.... just wonderful. Simply wonderful. In my mind, a must-try if it's on the menu.

After those great dishes, we were then left to decide on dessert. We ended up going with both options of the evening. First was a honey, indian celery and black walnut cookie served with raspberry ice cream and lichen dipped in chocolate. The cookie had a nice crunch with subtle hint of both the honey and the walnuts. The ice cream was smooth and flavourful and the use of lichen was an interesting component to bring forth.

The second dish was a spruce panna cotta with candied pumpkin seeds and wild blueberries. This was a very cool surprise. The texture you expect from panna cotta - rich and smooth - but the true surprise was just how strong the spruce came through. The combination of blueberry and pumpkin seeds were a nice pairing here as well. A strong finish.

Manitoba was what a had hoped for - a great unique mixture of dishes in a cool looking and feeling restaurant. As we sat outside in the back garden with a glass of wine partway through our meal, I thought to myself ""Yeah this is pretty great"". Pretty much says it all.

Cheers!",2015-08-30 21:16:23

We went for lunch and sat at one of the grills with another group. I ordered the passion fruit lemonade which was way too sweet for my tastes, and the Benihana Excellence. My dining partner got the Lunch Sea Scallops. Both of our meals came with a ""salad"" and mine came with soup. These were incredibly disappointing and looked like something from a really cheap buffet. The salad was drenched in an unappetizing dressing and the soup tasted like salted hot water. Luckily the rest of the meal was a lot more enjoyable. The scallops came with fried rice; the scallops were great (especially for the rice) and the rice was good, although a bit on the salty side. My shrimp, and vegetables were really good and the teriyaki beef was good but it was drenched in too much sauce for me. I personally thought the food tasted better without any of their dipping sauces. At the end of the meal they gave me ice cream with a candle on it and sang happy birthday. They also took a photo of us and printed it out and put it in a little paper frame. 

I definitely recommend signing up for the birthday special because it is a great deal. Also, of it's your first time go for lunch because they have a lot of reasonable lunch entrees.

I actually think this is a pretty good restaurant, but I'm not sure how anyone is finding them. They are in the parking lot of the Galleria Mall, but on the back side across the lot from Kohl's. This is less than five minutes from our house and we didn't know they were there. How did we find them? My parents were in town and they like to drive every single street in the area looking to see what restaurants and shops we have that they don't have in Ohio. They came back from their scouting mission and insisted we try this place. 

We have enjoyed all of the food items that we have tried here. On first visit (dinner) I had the Mediterranean salad which had a very tasty creamy lemon dressing that was memorable. I don't recall what my parents and husband had that night, but I do remember everyone enjoyed their food and said they'd return. 

Our most recent visit was for lunch on a Saturday. I had the steak salad special which was steak on a bed of spinach with mandarin oranges, gorgonzola, and a carmelized onion dressing. The salad was delicious and the steak on top was very flavorful and well prepared. My husband had the lasagna and really enjoyed it. I tasted some and thought the bite I tried was delicious. Both of our meals were generous portions and we thought the pricing was reasonable for the portions. 

The service yesterday was a little awkward. I'm only mentioning it because I think the food is good and I'd like to see this place stay in business. Our waitress was also the hostess yesterday. She seemed really annoyed during the time we were there. She wasn't rude to us, but she wasn't friendly either. I did think she was a little short with the table next to us and they didn't do anything to deserve it.

yfoosZ3vBGYBqctQ-anVKg,XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,OK0ba4X5seibH8oMWh4bhw,3,1,2,0,"So I have had a back and forth journey with this restaurant, and this has what has kept me from reviewing it.  I finally feel ready.  The first thing to know about this place is that there is no all you can eat and the rolls often are averaging around 13 dollars each (the ones I ordered normally around 14).  This automatically puts an expectation that they should be higher quality than an average sushi joint.  When you come inside the waitresses are dressed in traditional Japanese clothing and the restaurant is very sizeable, with lots of tables and booths, and a huge sushi bar.  Often there are many sushi chefs working behind it.  Despite its massive size, even on a busy night the service was relatively quick, and they work like a well oiled machine.

Now to the food, the first time I ever came here was about 4 years ago after being told I had to by multiple people.  I ordered a roll that involved mango and some other fun flavors, yet it was so bland and flavorless.  I refused to go back after that, and believed this place was over hyped.  I had a go to spot kaizen down the road so I had no need for them, however kaizen began to go down hill to the point that I gave up in them and jumped ship as a loyal customer.  

I was desperate and in need of sushi that was close by so I thought ok I will give I love sushi one more shot.  I ended up really enjoying my rolls! Totally different experience, I thought maybe I had just ordered wrong last time. I had got the 90 percent roll, bam bam roll and spring mountain roll I believe.  These were packed with flavor, and I continued to have a similar experience the times I would drive up to get my sushi fix, until about 6 months ago.  I went alone just wanting grab one roll, and it was one I had enjoyed in the past.  It had ponzu sauce on it and shrimp tempura and many other yummy things.  However they weren't yummy, it tasted so much saltier than normal and the tempura was not crispy, it tasted liken it had been sitting out and the pack on the roll was sloppy. I was sad, and my craving not fullfilled with goodness. 

 I hoped it was a fluke so I went this past Saturday since monta was closed for renovations, and I was starving for something Japanese. I was greeted by insanity! It was a football night, and I guess this place becomes a sports bar when that happens, it was so loud I couldn't hear my boyfriend talk.  Whatever just give me good food that is all I want, we ordered the niku udon for the first time.  They have the medium thickness udon, not as thin as I prefer, but not thick like slugs.  It was some of the better niku in the valley,with a really full bodied broth, and the reason this review is not two stars.  I also ordered the 90 percent roll, a roll I thought I could trust, and another roll that had various forms of yellow tail and a ""orange sauce"".  The yellow tail roll was fine, not amazing though for its price tag.  The bam bam roll was aweful. The dip was saltier than it used to be, and the soft shell crab had become oddly tough. 

So sadly unless I really want some niku, I am over this place.  Good sushi in a desert is so elusive, I will continue my search.",2016-01-18 17:11:30

I just went to eat the left overs only to find a HUGE piece of meat - beef, lamb? its brown..and some other meat rice dish mixed into my veg left overs. This over-site is really unfortunate. I called to complain and the apology seemed very insincere.  First I had to explain to a server the problem and he just totally didn't understand, then I was passed off to the manager. As a vegetarian it really is upsetting to have meat mixed into your food. I don't think this place understands this.

Luckily, the guys at Discount Tire Center took great care of me.  

I pulled in, hesitantly got out of my car and wandered into the garage.  A man promptly greeted me and asked me what he could do.  I asked for two new tires, he took a quick look at my car and told me, ""No problem, pull it in"".  

He discussed the options of tires in a way I could understand, giving his suggestions but ultimately leaving the decision up to me.  He also let me know about a rebate on 4 tires, which I ended up getting (after a frantic call to my husband asking if I was stupid for being upsold).  It ended up being a great deal and I never felt pressured to buy more.

The ambience is not quite 'fine' fine dining, more of a contemporary steakhouse. Not a bad thing at all, just be advised if you're looking for truly romantic, this is probably not it. Regardless, the food befits the title of fine dining without any consideration.

Began with the short rib ravioli. While smaller in portion, the flavor was unparalleled, including the apples and carrots included. Highly recommended.

As for steak, spend the money. It's a fair bit, but do it DO. IT. I'm talking, of course, about the Mishima reserve wagyu. The rib cap was divine. Melt in your mouth, lose your mind perfection. It doesn't quite stand to A5 kobe, but the price differential between the two may as well be the Grand Canyon. A bernaise sauce complements the steak well. I recommend the medium rare wagyu rib cap.

Sides. Oh my God, sides. If you don't order the potatoes au gratin, you're a fool. Plain and simple. I probably gained 2 pounds from this side alone, and I don't care. One of the best sides in the city. Period. 

Oh crap, almost didn't mention the complimentary duck fat fries with tasting sauces. If you've never had these, you've never had fries. This redefines the experience.

I thought the margs were tasty (I ordered a passion fruit & a strawberry) but my sis thought otherwise, she didn't even finish hers, bummer. However, we both agreed that the calamari rings were amazing. The best part: the jalapeno lime sauce that came with! After chatting for probably over an hour (my sis is a talker!), we finally decided on our entrees. Traci ordered the grilled peach salad with chicken & I ordered the RPM kitchen bowl with chicken (RPM= rice, pinto beans & meat). Traci loved her salad & devoured the entire thing! I too loved my entree, all the flavors went together so well! We were both stuffed but being the dessert junkie I am I had to order dessert to go. I went with the creme brulee, flavor of the day was butterscotch. When I got home later that night I dug in & it was just ok.

I absolutely love this board game cafe, and will need to try their escape rooms soon to give an opinion on that aspect. 

There is no cover for the board game cafe. Instead, each person needs to purchase something off the menu before the table can start playing the board/video games available. I was afraid that the drinks would be expensive since there was no cover but the prices were VERY REASONABLE and wallet friendly! I got their matcha latte ($5.75) which came with a very cute bear latte art. I've also tried their lavender London fog ($5.25) and really enjoyed it. They also serve hot food (panini) and snacks (popcorn, chips).

There is a large variety of board games to choose from, and some games even have duplicate copies. Some games include: pictionary, settlers of catan, monopoly deal, Bang, jenga, exploding kittens, coup, and much much more... As for consoles, they have a couple like wii and Xbox.

As a heads up...
- FREE WIFI: The password is written on the top left corner on the menu.
- WASHROOM: You would need to get the key (there's two) near the entrance of the cafe. 
- BOARD GAMES: Check to see if you have all the pieces needed to start the game... because I noticed some are missing.

Our truck was making squeaking noises so we took it in to get new brakes. They checked it ($70 diagnostic fee) and said the brakes were fine and sent us on our way. Wow, an honest mechanic! Amazing! I gave a glowing yelp review and recommended them to friends. Not even a week later the truck develops a horrible sound when braking. We just got it checked so we thought maybe something was loose and we almost put off getting it checked for awhile. We quickly changed our mind when it got so bad that we knew something was wrong. Took it to another place and they showed us that our back brakes were literally metal to metal. Had to spend $500 in brakes and rotors and put our children in danger driving with a truck that had NO back brakes. We then, as bad luck would have it, we discover a loss of power when accelerating about a month or so later. Against our better judgment we take it back to Rebel. They do a diagnostic and tell us we need new exhaust manifolds and motor mounts and it costs $2200! Luckily we found out a family friend has a shop in Vegas and he offers to look at it for us. He tells us the exhaust manifolds and motor mounts are absolutely fine and it is actually the computer that isn't responding. We need to take it to the dealer to determine the issue. So Rebel basically ripped us off $140 in diagnostic tests, almost got us killed by not replacing the brakes and attempted to rip us off for $2200 for things that weren't even broken.

We were primarily in search of a Bloody Mary, which BZ's fortunately offered. It wasn't the best Bloody I've ever had, but it wasn't bad. It definitely could have used more spice--pepper or horseradish or really anything to give it some kick. We remedied this issue ourselves with a ton of black pepper.

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I expected the typical fried chicken breast, coated in buffalo sauce--instead, BZ's serves a grilled chicken breast with a thicker sauce slathered on top. The sauce did not taste like traditional wing sauce, but reminded me more of a spicy barbeque sauce. It wasn't bad, but as a die hard lover of wings and all things coated in buffalo sauce, this wasn't quite what I expected and I thought for a moment they had given me the wrong sandwich.

In the thralls of finding a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was with serendipitous timing that enRoute magazine unleashed its Best New Restaurants in Canada upon the web. Top of the list? Edulis, a local restaurant, thus relieving me of any need to continue my search. (They also made MacLean's Top 50 Best Restaurants in Canada.) A couple emails later, and our table was booked. (They say an online reservation system is coming soon.) 

Cozy and charming, this intimate restaurant is tucked away on a rather nondescript stretch of Niagara St. just south of King. The juxtaposition of the best restaurant in Canada facing onto a large co-op housing complex is worthy of note, and could serve as an archetype for boosters of mixed-income urban planning near and afar. Anyway, I digress.

Debating between the smaller ($50) or larger ($70) tasting menus, our waitress indicated that the former would be sufficient to fill our bellies. We opted for the latter, and were prepared to have to undo a few buttons. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. 

Look, I get that higher-end restaurants skew towards smaller portions; I have no problem with that, and come to expect it. But if I'm ordering a seven-course tasting menu, I expect to be reasonably satiated by the end of the journey. Am I completely off base here? Alas, if it weren't for the constant re-filling of our bread basket (great home-made bread, btw), we all would have left hungry - and it's not like we have huge appetites to begin with. The blame I think is two-fold: First, many of the dishes were protein-heavy, with very little in the way of carbs. This is regrettable, as the one significant starch I do recall (a side of potatoes in a Djion vinaigrette) was phenomenal. Second, there was way too much downtime between some of the courses. Easily 20-25 minutes passed between some of the courses. Had the intervals been a bit shorter, I think we would have been okay.

Not to say that service wasn't exemplary. As soon as we entered service was fantastic. Water was constantly topped off, fresh cutlery was brought out every meal, and the table was kept spotless. Presumably the bottleneck was in the kitchen. 

That being said, the actual food when it came was superb. Of the seven dishes, four consisted of seafood (herring, mussles, tuna, some white fish), two of meat (veal and sweetbreads, duck two ways), and dessert (ice cream and cookie, shared baba au rhum cake). I'd try to describe them in more detail, but would be doing them an injustice. The food was outstanding - I just wish there were more of it.

Next time I think a better strategy would be to order a few dishes à la carte, and share those. I saw some tables adopting this strategy and the serving sizes seemed substantial. It would also eliminate some of the waiting between courses.

I work in the industry, so yes I do have higher standards than most when it comes to dining, but I usually ignore most of my critical thinking in such terms in favor of enjoying my experience.  Some things however, are unacceptable.

The extent of which your patio had spider webs, under the table, on the chairs, and on the ceiling is beyond unacceptable.  I understand it is outside and next to the water, making that a challenge, but it is a challenge that comes with such a space.  I imagine the investment in a power washer would be wise.  Especially since your patio is essentially your prime seating area.  If you get nothing from reading this, get that.

In terms of service, some things need to happen.  First, and more important than anything else as far as improving service at your establishment goes, is seating points.  It hasn't happened every time I have eaten there, but the one time it did happen was rediculous.  The server painfully, obviously, had either no regard or no idea what seating points are.  EVERY dish that was delivered to our table was auctioned off.  EVERY dish.  Not one, not a few, not a majority.  All of them.  That is insane to me.

6dUXKtS2U59I8-NM04ExJQ,epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,-MhfebM0QIsKt87iDN-FNw,3,4,1,1,"The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art may not be comparable to galleries found in major metropolitan cities, but it's a much appreciated gallery that Las Vegas is fortunate to have. It offers visitors the opportunity to view artwork by renowned artists.

Finding the gallery can be an adventure. Being a local who's somewhat familiar with the layout of the Bellagio, I've never seen the gallery before and had to ask for assistance on its whereabouts. The gallery is tucked in another wing in the Bellagio, away from the boisterous sounds and excitement of the casino. If you know/can find Cafe Gelato, it's within close proximity.

Here's a rundown of the current ticket prices:

General Admission:  $16
*Nevada Resident: $13
Students, Teachers, and Military: $11 (High School student IDs only)
Children 12 and under: Free

*Nevada Resident prices are $8 on Wednesdays only from 5:00pm - 7:30pm. 

I came here on a Wednesday to take advantage of the $8 Nevada Resident price, which I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have paid the full amount to see an exhibit. Like some reviewers have mentioned, the gallery is very small, and you'll be in and out within an hour at max. There's a free guided tour device that makes me feel like I'm Zack Morris talking into a brick phone. It's complimentary, and I'd suggest grabbing one because the plaques don't have much details about the art. 

For art lovers, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art might be a good place to visit, but  for someone who's only mildly interested, I might just skip it all together and view the art online instead.",2013-05-09 18:07:55

Of course i can't forget the combination fried rice. It has pork, chicken, and shrimp not to mention the perfect combination of fried rice with all the great flavor. I have never had a problem with their dishes. Everything is served hot and fresh and never taste bad. I never have stomach issues either like some other restaurants.

First visit:
Booked an appointment based on the recommendation of a friend that had just tried Mint the week before. The first thing I noticed is that I was able to book my appointment online. Being that the idea struck me at 1130pm, it was really easy and convenient to be able to make an appointment for the next day. I received an instant confirmation email which was a nice touch. The studio was cute and the polish selection was very impressive. I also appreciated that the polish was not old and I didn't need 10 layers to make it look normal. I've had the experience with walk-in salons where the polish has been old and gone on streaky. The owner greeted us immediately and the entire experience was really pleasant.

What an impressive breakfast joint all around.

I went with one of my girlfriends who lives downtown - she's raved before about how awesome the breakfast dishes are here. MTO is small in size with a beautiful high ceiling. The ambiance is bright - pretty trendy, hipster, and inviting. 

Rachel was our server and she was laid back and personable, making our breakfast experience very comfortable. She greeted us right away and asked for our drink orders. My friend and I both asked for a water and a mimosa (to start the day off right!) Let me tell you - their mimosa is THE perfect mimosa. I watched them pour our glasses and they ensure you get plenty of champagne, topped with fresh OJ. For $5 a glass ($20 for bottomless) you definitely cannot go wrong with their strong and refreshing mimosas! 

One thing I noticed about MTO is how ginormous their water glasses are. So. Perfect. Helps me from constantly waiting or having to ask for refills. Coffee also comes in a huge mug. I'm a fan. Breakfast dishes (the most important part) were very tasty which completes MTO's 5 star review:

- Steak and Eggs
6oz Tri Tip comes cut with toast, 3 eggs any style, and hash brown. The steak was seasoned perfectly so I didn't need to add anything. The portion of the entire dish was huge, I couldn't finish it all!

- Avocado Scramble 
Scrambled eggs topped with cheese, jalapeños, cilantro, and tomatillo sauce. My friend added chicken sausage for some extra protein and topped her dish with Cholula sauce. Also a delicious and filling breakfast dish!

We both live east of the city, and our friends suggested that we check out Istanbul Sofra's $26.16 multi-course dinner menu.

The best way to describe the appearance of the restaurant is... eccentric. I feel like someone collected a bunch of super cliché ""Turkish"" decorations and made absolutely zero interior decorating edits when putting the restaurant together. My initial reaction when seeing the restaurant was oh-my-what-have-I-gotten-myself-into. Thankfully, the decor in no way reflected my experience of the food and service of the restaurant.

The service was very prompt and attentive. English is likely a second language to our waitress, but she did her best to describe the menu options and answer our questions. The restaurant manager or owner - not sure who he was - also checked on us toward the end of the meal, which is a service that I always appreciate.

The food was really delicious. The four of us ordered four different cold appetizers (included in our Restaurant Week prix fixe dinner) Hummus, Dolma (Stuffed Grape Leaves), Haydari, and Baba Ghanoush. All four were very tasty and quickly attacked by the four of us. My personal favorite was the Haydari (yogurt with chopped walnuts, garlic, and dried mint), and I just couldn't stop hoarding pita to eat with this dish. For my entree, I ordered the Lamb & Chicken Shish Kebab. The dish was huge, and I only made it through eating my kebabs, leaving some of my rice and a good portion of my salad and side of vegetables. Everything was very flavorful and well-seasoned - definitely an entree I would order again. Finally, for dessert, I ordered the simple Baklava, which I had been craving for some reason that week. It was a solid, tasty selection, but the rest of the table was more adventurous. My husband ordered the milk pudding, which I thought was similar to a Spanish Flan, and our friend Jason was the only one who bravely ordered the Restaurant Week special Tavuk Göğsü, a milk pudding made with chicken meat. The pudding in this dish was a bit more savory and every other bite or so had a small piece of boiled chicken inside. It was odd - but not bad.

I recommend looking past the goofy decor and trying this restaurant - I think you'll like it!",2016-01-31 04:20:42

Ambiance is as expected. Nice sandwich guy, helpful, laid back, just what you would expect. Loved the smell in the store, loved the generous aluminum foil they use to wrap the sandwiches. Bf got the Chicago Combo, I got the Cleveland. Both were wet with crunch. Took it home to eat.

Loved the chips on top of the sandwich, and how it soaks up the jus. Unfortunately, that's when it stops. Did not like the jus making the paper underneath so soft that eventually, I ended up getting little pieces of paper with some bites. Wish I had gotten it soaked with crunch as the ends of the bread were a bit hard, and the turkey was dry at the end. Ate the whole sandwich, too full. Took a nap. Felt SO salt overloaded. Sad. $18 for 2 sandwiches. 

Lesson learned: avoid meaty sandwich stores. Might be for other people, but I would rather use that $18 for 4 bahn mi's (the standard for perfect sandwich imo).",2013-10-06 00:07:08

(On a side note, I think M Resort does modern with more grace than Aria.) I had wanted to try Mantra Masala because it is featured on lvvegan.com (great resource for you Las Vegan vegans), and because it was on the way, we stopped in. 

My theory is that Mantra is hoping that there are some Indian-food lovers within a 3-mile radius who don't want to venture far. If that were me, then I would be pleased with the offerings. We had dal, dewane handi and naan. The dal was more tomato-y than varieties I have experienced, but the flavors and spice levels were solid. (We asked for hotter than ""white people hot"", and they interpreted that nicely.)

The naan was fine, not spectacular. 

However, the real disappointment were the prices, especially given the mouse-sized portion of rice that comes with an entree. While $30 for 2 is not an expensive dinner, when you are staring at an entree, a side, a peck of rice and a basket of naan, you start to fantasize about the $19 for 2 spread you could be noshing on at the Namaste buffet. 

And, although we were not there for lunch, they gave us a lunch special menu to look over. There was one under $6, but it is only rice and one entree. No buffet. No deal. I truly wonder how an Indian restaurant can neglect the beauty of a lunch buffet. It is the only buffet I will eat.

In closing, if you are within walking distance to Mantra Masala, it is probably the best food you could walk to, which might sound like an insult, but I mean it is a 3-star compliment.",2010-01-14 01:14:31

Noodles!! Hand Pulled Uyghur Noodles!

Pro Tip: Don't be fooled by the name of the restaurant! They just disappointing.. Skip!

We tried

Lamb ($1.98) - meh
Beef ($1.98) - meh
Shrimp ($2.50) - meh
Lamb Kidney ($3.50) - dried and bland

All the skewers just bland tasting, they supposed to be marinated before bbq on charcoal.. definitely lack the fresh off the grill taste!

Pro Tip: Order the 2 noodles off the menu

We shared 

Langman with Lamb ($8.99) 
- noodles cooked al dente with good bites
- Love the green beans that not overcooked give good contrast to the noodle
- spicy pepper and sauce are delicious!
- portion on the smaller size 

I really enjoy their house made hot sauce which has a really distinguish favours and wondering what's the ingredients. The waitress just said she is not sure because she didn't make it herself? 

Charcoal Kebob House has a really limited menu. Hopefully there will be more interesting items be added and they would improve on their grilled skewers since they just opened recently!

Maybe I might come back and try their Danpanji (Big Plate Chicken with Home made noodle) or Manta (Steamed Lamb Dumplings 6/$11.50) but definitely not in a rush... 

Pro Tip: There are a lot of other restaurants in the Scarborough area that offers similar items at a much lower price point and taste better... 

I really want to love Charcoal Kebob because of their nice family vibe but hopefully they would improve over time as they are really relatively new!",2012-11-12 05:08:02

This was the first time any of our party ventured into luncheon land here, and while one can't decry the value, when the meatloaf is dry there can be , contrary to man-logic, be too  much!

Their seafood miso soup is to die for. They also have few specialities that are amazing and if you like sushi as desert, you gotta try their desert sushi. Service is great and very attentive, if you not sure what to order they will definitely help you. Have been there several time Stephane (one of their waitress) is great, always in a happy mood and will probably remember what you like to eat and if they have new specialities he may mention if you will or will not like it
Also they may ask what you like as sushi and suggest you some ideas.

They do a pretty good set up for the games in the dining room area with screens all over. Lots of giveaways of bears merchandise during the game. Also raffle some good looking jerseys and expensive gifts at the end of games. Typical bar style food with some things on special for the games which is nice. Started having Chicago dogs which is a good idea if your a Bears bar. So if your a Chicago Bears fan and looking for a good bar to watch the game and talk with some good Chicago people this is the place. Waitresses are on top of things in the dining room even with a packed bar of Chicago people eating and drinking,2015-09-26 16:41:47

The interior is sparse and lackluster, sort of a banquet hall feel for some reason. It was clean but missed the charm some how. 

The staff was very nice and helpful, they appeared to be short a person or not prepared for the large crowd. 

I scanned every ones plates while walking to the bar and saw a nice mix match of entrees. Pizza, pasta, salads, hoagies etc. It all looked good. 

I choose the 7 inch Margherita and a salad with blue cheese. The pizza is a wood fires thin crust cooked to perfection. Topped with mozz and basil. The sauce was a tomato based but has decent flavor. It was a little salty but I liked it. The cheese was a little thin in places but it worked, the basil was haphazardly tossed to one slice of the 7 inch pizza but meh it is only basil. The pizza was good but not as good as Pizza A Metros. I hated to compare but I did. 

The salad was large for a side, with romaine, mushrooms, red pepper and tomato's The dressing was blue cheese but not a thick type it was a thin coating of a nice flavored dressing.

     A friend was kicked out of this place for practicing 'pagan' rituals -- she pulled out a deck of tarot cards and began 'divining'. Whatever, the owner can do what he wants. Interesting point number two -- when this business first opened, the permit in the window indicated that a Church Organization was going to be built. Hmmm, so this is what you can do if you only pay 'church' taxes...
     ...O.K. enough of the shenanigans. How is the business? Nice.  For instance, they are very allowing of unusual behaviour, dress, et cetera. If you are young and can't hang out anywhere, the House wants you to go there and hopefully become a member of the flock, so called. That's cool. I am all for 'false family' organizations, secret societies, and the like. 
     But what do I think of the product? For food, passably edible. But the business name includes the excitingly debatable notion 'Coffee'. So what is coffee like at the House? I will be honest and direct, for those of you who are not trained roasters. It's Fratello coffee, so it's 'Fauxcal' -- meaning that the company's marketing and advertising emphasizes the fact that it is a local company (in this case roasting the coffee), yet their secondary/tertiary production is of a scale and order of magnitude operationally comparable to multinational corporate food production. Fratello's are now Calgary's coffee equivalent of Lakeside packers, or Cargill meats -- geographically they are local, true. Yet operationally and gastrointestinally there seems to be nothing in common between the product Fratello's produces and the product that specialty roasters such as Roasterie (10th st. n.w. Calgary), or La Vieille (Rue Y. Laurent, Montreal) produces.
     All one has to do is a taste comparison. Having done so a number of times, I congratulate Fratello on making a product nearly indistinguishable from Phil and Sebastian. In fact, Fratello's espresso is more palatable than P&S's. But to compare either businesses product to an actual micro-roasted, local coffee is similar to comparing Black Diamond's Hickory Smoked Processed Cheese to a farm-sourced cold smoked Wensleydale. Different milks, even...
     ...on that note I conclude my humble analysis of The House Coffee & Sanctuary. I was going to give it two stars, because Jesus seemed like a pretty good example of how to live -- then I realized that I'm reviewing a coffee shop, not a way of life. And they get their coffee from a manufacturer of 'coffee pods'. Right up there with Nestle, Maxwell House and Kraft. Keep expanding, boys.",2011-12-01 05:33:22

We had the Greek God as an appetizer. The bread was soft and delicious, and the hummus was good, though I think they were a little light handed on how much hummus they gave us. The marinated vegetables were so delicious, though - definitely my favorite part of the entire appetizer.

My husband had the bacon cheeseburger, which was cooked to a perfect medium. The meat was moist and delicious, and the toppings were fresh. He had the mac and cheese as a side, which was really good.

I had the veggie stack, which I loved. The selection of vegetables were so delicious, and the portion was huge. I had an heirloom tomato salad on the side; I thought the choice of fresh mint as part of the dressing was fantastic. So good!

It is unfortunate that their promotion may be causing a larger amount of 5 star reviews that one would normally see.  The sign near the register just says ""yelp us"" but I imagine it would be awkward for someone to leave a low star review and then show it to get 10% off their next order.  I did not take part in the promotional offer.

Pondered whether to give this place a 3 or 4.  Parking can be nonexistent though they have one reserved space right in front of their shop.

I tried a vanilla macaron and eclair.  The white macaron was light, soft, and had a slight chew. It was MUCH smaller (maybe the size of an Oreo?) than French Grocery's but also much less tough/chewy (FG's was very cold though, so perhaps that was the issue).  It wasn't as melt-in-your-mouth as Essence Bakery's tiny variety pack macarons I had before, perhaps because it came right out of the refrigerated case.  The tiny little eclair's chocolate frosting/ganache swirl was very chilled, and so I didn't get the full flavor from it.  The eclair had a nice light and flakey texture, and the custard filling was excellent.

Both items were $2 for about two to three bites a piece.  It's not incredibly expensive, but it also is solidly a ""tiny indulgence"" that feels more appropriate as a a cute gift or a treat plucked off a shiny tray at a party, as opposed to a nice after-dinner dessert.  I suppose I am more accustomed to the large ""this can last me two days"" pastry from somewhere like Urban Cookies or AJ's.  It doesn't exactly feel like a ""good value"" when the items are so tiny, but you do get to try several items.

The cashier/worker was friendly, though she had to ask someone who I assume was the baker what the eclair filling was.  Still, pleasant people and pleasant atmosphere!  I feel the packaging and branding could use some work for the prices they're charging.  Their plain white paper and brown cardboard packaging could look a lot more marketable with a nice large store logo sticker on it, for example.",2015-03-06 06:14:28

The restaurant is very classic and demure.  And, as many note, you can see the fountains well from some tables.

On to the food:

We had the seafood tower.  Usually, the lobster is the star, but in this one, it was the crab for me.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked.  

Crabcakes was probably the most disappointing dish.  Serviceable, but not what I expected.

Had several sides.  The stars were mac n cheese and onion rings.  Will defintely get these 2 dishes again.  My wife had the filet and lobster.  Filet cooked PERFECTLY rare.  This was textbook, and no black on the outside, which was a feat for such a thick steak.  The lobster was one of the best I have had.  I had the bone-in ribeye, which was another perfect medium rare.  Excellent flavor, the dry aging came through.

The wine list is extensive, and pricey.  We had Italian at our table and all choices were excellent.  Port for dessert was actually not as bad price wise.  But, expect to pay if you are a wine drinker, as is common on the Strip.

Overall, a very expensive evening but one that we will do again.  If you are a steak fan, highly recommended.

My family and I frequent the Arboretum for shopping at places like Bed Bath & Beyond as well as Walmart and Michaels. We decided to slow drive through the entire lot on both sides to see what else was offered and ran across a couple restaurants.
I immediately took to YELP to see some pics and read some review highlights to determine if we were going to try out any of the restaurants. After looking this place up I saw so many ups and downs in opinions and decided that we needed to down our own opinion and give this place a try and what better time to do so than Queens Fest Week as I've read how pricy this place can be.

The food was decent and edible, the service sucked as the server was very distant and unattentative. We had to nearly stand up to get his attention and get him to come over to refill water or to pick up finished dishes.
The add on cost were ridiculous during Queens Fest. It caused the 3course meal to only be about $4 less than ordering from the regular menu which isn't really a deal in my opinion as a restaurant enthusiast who knows a deal when I see one or am experiencing one. 

I honestly enjoyed my dish which was the crab cakes and having lived in MD for 2 years I know a GENUINE crab cake when I see and taste one. The string beans were also extremely tasty and you get a LOT. My husband had the filet scampi which was a filet mignon topped with shrimp scampi and he didn't leave any behind LoL. My daughter had lobster tails which was one of the upgrade cost and she wasn't full from it as she LOVES food and thought she was on a cruise at the Captain cocktail party where you get unlimited lobster tails LoL. For dessert my daughter again upgraded cost to get the chocolate cake which she is still raving about. I had carrot cake and my husband had the cheesecake. We all had dessert as leftovers and also the string beans as they give you a LOT on the side. My daughter had grits left over as well as that was the side she had with her lobster tails. 

The amount of sides offered and the type of sides offered is pretty slim which is another caveat in conjunction with the overpricing.

They are $6 for 6 but they are all prepackaged and you cannot choose the flavour. For $1 each I could not complain. Taste wise I think they are quite good and with good texture and not too sweet, just the way I like mine. 

The lady behind the counter was so friendly and we start discussing about macaroons in GTA. She said Tokyo bakery makes their own and no one else sell theirs..but I do have doubts because Cakeview Bakery ( http://www.yelp.ca/biz/cakeview-bakery-and-cafe-scarborough#hrid:2yIu2MBEEMICp_oZtn0G4g/src:self) less than 5 min drive North has similar looking macaroons....

Why was the red wine served cold?

Why were the roasted beets served with a teaspoon?

Why was the warm cooked salmon entree served atop a cold salad (ice-cold cornbread croutons and all)?  Call me uber-traditional but I think I prefer hot-on-hot and cold-on-cold.

Personally, I love their popcorn. You walk into Target and that's the first thing you smell. It smells tasty! And it tastes just as good, if not better, than how it smells. You get a decent-sized bag for a buck.

They also have this little area in the front where the carts are. It has about thirty things for a dollar. Usually they're pretty crappy but you can usually find something cool.

I dined all alone at Piccadilly Freemont - and not because I'm a lonely thirty-something spinster!  Well, I guess I am a lonely thirty-something spinster - but that's not why I dined alone.  Trust me, this joint was empty for good reason.  

This place is just awful.  I don't know what brand of frozen pizza they toss in the microwave to serve their patrons, but I can assure you it's on the low-end of the freezer-section pizza spectrum.  I ordered the $5.99 special - 2 cheese slices and a 16 oz soda and it seemed like a bargain until I got my food.

A few hours later we were pulling up to MGM Grand's valet.

Upon arriving to the restaurant, the hostess asked that we wait in the lounge while they prepare our table. A gentleman came by and asked if we'd like Champagne while we wait. Why not? Ten years of marriage deserves a toast. Little did we know, those two glasses of champagne were $29 each. Sneaky. 

Our table was in the garden, flowers and vines were all around. The tables had teal runners, white napkins tied with teal ribbon. This shade was nearly identical to the colors I used for my wedding. Pure coincidence, but it was a lovely nod to our memorable day. The menu was presented and we were given time to peruse it. It's overwhelming. There is the 16 course tasting menu, which is mighty tempting, an a la carte menu and several prix-fixe options. We opted for the prixe-fixe that offered two appetizers, main course and dessert ($198 per person). You choose your dishes from a varied selection. We each chose a cold and hot appetizer, entree and dessert; we felt this was the best way to sample as much of the menu as possible without gorging ourselves or breaking the bank. You're given a choice of flat or sparkling water ($10 per bottle of Evian). We also selected a half bottle Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc ($35) and then our feast was underway. 

We began with a Split Pea Amuse Bouche, it has marshmallows (savory, not sweet) pistachios and another tasty bite I cannot recall. 

I've heard tales of the bread cart, but I hadn't imagined this glorious nirvana with more than a dozen options. We had about five rounds of bread. Yes, seriously. It was complete carbicide. We loved every minute. My final meal will include their bread cart. No question. They also hand churn butter; there's a lovely presentation, and the olive oil is divine. Don't miss the croissants! They were so fabulous, I now want to visit France. 

Next, were the cold appetizers: asparagus with orange vinaigrette and sea urchin, and king crab salad.  Then, the warm appetizers: Crispy soft boiled egg in light comte cheese sauce with Iberico de Bellota ham, our favorite dish. Stellar. And truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage ($35 supplement), it was tasty, but not worth the upcharge. 

Our entree selections included, suckling pig prepared three ways: braised shoulder, chop and chorizo cannelloni ($30 supplement) and braised beef cheeks in eggplant and the most delicious mashed potatoes in existence. 

We also tacked on a cheese course from the trolley ($30), there were plenty of soft and hard cheese to choose from. We favor hard cheeses, but did try one soft cheese that was described as warm fondue, rings of Spruce tree are wrapped around the young cheese to impart flavor and vessel for transport. We agreed it was awful, thankfully the hard cheeses and the Roquefort did not disappoint. 

And finally, dessert! Frank had the chocolate soufflé ($15 supplement), it was outstanding. I had a raspberry mascarpone something or another. It had the most concentrated raspberry flavor imaginable. 

In addition to dessert, you're given the opportunity to select treats from the Mignardises trolley. I refer to this as the Willy Wonka experience. There must have been a hundred different items to choose from, we only chose a handful because we were beyond stuffed. The tirimisu was delicious and I've never liked creme brulee until now. 

With the check, we were given a parting gift: a citrus pound cake, and photo book. 

It was a huge splurge, but a fantastic experience. My expectations were incredibly high for a restaurant of this caliber. It is the first and only 3 Star Michelin Guide Winner in Las Vegas.

For food, I split the chef's choice that came with 1 specialty roll, 1 inside-out roll, and 1 regular roll for $20 because we were having trouble deciding on which rolls we wanted. Maybe we got lucky, but the three rolls we got were right up our alley in terms of flavors we liked! We got the rainbow roll, maybe the negihama?, and the spicy tuna roll. All three rolls were also very sizeable with 2 of them being 8 pieces and 1 of them being 6 pieces. It was a fantastic deal considering the amount of sushi we got and the quality of the rolls.
Everyone else that we were with also enjoyed their rolls and appetizers.
I would definitely go back again to try more cocktails and some of their other rolls and food options.",2017-02-21 04:18:23

As far as the food goes, it was decent. Their kalbi and teriyaki chicken are worth getting. I disliked their spam musubi ($2/roll) because I could make better tasting ones at home.

We were wanting to try something new and we saw an ad for Island Malaysian in a magazine. Of course I looked it up on Yelp and was drawn in to the delightful, yummy-looking pictures.

It's located in a giant Chinatown stripmall (by the Chinese grocery store). The decor inside is surprisingly cute, very island-y and clean. The big plastic, orange chopsticks are fun too. The menus also come with a large black binder, it reminded me of a karaoke book. Inside are numbered pictures of all the dishes, which correspond with the numbers in the menu.

We ordered:

-Lychee juice
-Fresh young coconut
-Roto canai
-Basil noodles
-Spicy beef with side of cucumbers
-Peanut bread dessert
-Mango sticky rice dessert

Deelish! The lychee juice tastes refreshing and is not overly sweet. I will upload a picture. I loved the roto canai ""tissue"" bread. Tearing off pieces and dipping it in to the little bowl of curry that comes with it was lovely. Great flavor and texture.

The basil noodles were marked as spicy in their menu but (blame my Korean palate) I definitely could have taken it a lot more spicier. I will just have to ask for it extra spicy next time. The peanut bread was crushed peanuts with honey and butter inside the ""tissue"" breading. Not overly sweet but very tasty.

Service was good, the middle-aged woman who sat us and served us was really friendly and helpful.

I will definitely be back to try more Malaysian dishes!",2012-07-19 19:14:37

However, I did enjoy my meal at this little locally owned restaurant.  

I met a friend at Perk for a weekday lunch last Wednesday.  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile and wasn't surprised to find it hiding in a strip mall (like so many little gems here in AZ).  The atmosphere was nothing special but we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  My friend had an omelette and I had a Greek Salad.  The service was not attentive despite the fact that there were few patrons while we were there.  (I have a feeling they get slammed for weekend brunches though).  The food was good; not mindblowing, but decent.  I like the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients.  One more perk is that I believe they have free wi-fi (but I cannot attest to using it).

While I was waiting, the dog Buttercup took a liking to me and curled up on my lap. She is a 12 year old TINY poodle who is very loving (though a bit skidish). 

The Good:

1. Staff. Very friendly, accommodating staff, which I noticed right from the time I booked.
2. Website. You are able to book your appointments online then they email you with a day and a time. It's great!
3. Buttercup. Who doesn't love a dog to cuddle with while you wait for the doctor?

We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately - just in time for lunch specials. We both ordered the same dish. The curry beef brisket with rice. 

The lunch menu suppose to rotate every week. The restaurant is small with at least 22 tables (didn't really count all of them lol). The number of parking spaces is too few for the number restaurants and businesses in the same plaza. 

Back to the food - the curry sauce was a tad spicy for me and pretty standard. It was flavourful and went well with the onion, potatoes and brisket. The lunch also came with a soup (tomato or cream based), bread with butter on the side, and a choice between coffee or milk tea (hot or cold). Milk tea hot or cold is pretty good. You can request to have more milk or more tea in the drink. 

I'm satisfied with the portion size of the dish and the flavours and it was definitely very filling. I had seen a few couples actually bring their own glass containers to take leftovers home. Which is a great idea for lunch the next day. 

It wasn't amazing but overall quite decent and I would come back to try other things. If you need a refill of hot tea it's easy to request for another refill because the service is pretty attentive. Food came out fairly quickly.

Fresh, handmade pasta at this quality is pretty rare from what I've seen in the area. Esther's has about 6-8 pastas to choose from, all tasty and unique, fresh out the oven. Most are priced around $15 which is unbelievably affordable. Cocktail menu at $9 is cheap as are the beers at about $5, with many local options in bottle and draught. 

Esther's, as of this review, is a reservation must since they seem to not seat the entire dining room at once; perhaps based on not enough servers. Bar seating available with full menu which is nice. 

Our meal began with a Esther style sazerac which really hit the spot. The prosecco cocktail from the menu was tasty as well, with the sage hitting home. Next we had a Caesar salad and fresh bread. Salad was very nice with thick and long romaine. The bread was glorious. I usually get peeved when bread is not complimentary, but for $4 they give you an entire loaf, charred perfectly - really exceptional bread. For entrees we had the spicy spaghetti and the sausage pasta (not sure actual menu titles). Sausage was a true standout. Really full dish with a lot going on. The pasta, similar to a small gnocchi, was oh so fresh. A little undercooked which is perfect for fr shot made pasta. The spaghetti was good but nothing compared to the other dish.

I waited 30 minutes to be seated just to have the worst ""mexican"" dish I've ever had in my life. The only good thing about this place is the service, Eddie did a great job.

After another 15 minutes of wondering where the rest of our food was they brought the sandwiches. I do not believe they served me the right one, but by now I was a bit resigned. My mom told me the shrimp bisque she ordered was okay but that she did not like the curry flavor it had ... by now we are 3/4 done with our meal and the coffee is no where in evidence.

Took mama-Chy here and for three people who ate like the royal court, the total bill was $35 with tip!

We ordered Kitchen Omelet add bacon, with Multi-Grain bread and American Fries, Meat Eater Omelet with Pancakes, and Hashbrowns, and Eggs Benedict. Also, three coffees.

They make their own bread, the multi-grain is a heartier, thicker (think Texas toast), yet soft and chewy. Their pancakes are billed as 'Plate-Sized' and it's not a false advertisement, they are as big as the plate, in fact it was even hanging over the plate a bit. The omelets were huge! Bigger than the two eggs it states it's made with, perhaps it's all the generous fillings of vegetables and meats that make this a stand-out both in portion and flavor. Sometimes, the bacon is under cooked, or chewy in an omelet, not here, they are crispy!

I'd recommend the American Fries, the quartered potatoes have a flavorful crunch and the insides were not mushy nor dry.

The staff here never miss a beat, I don't believe our koffee kups were ever beyond half empty.

Get here early, as it does fill up and the tiny parking lot is a zoo on weekends and most morning.

I got the shrimp and grits which was basically the same grits and shrimp from the buffet section put together. The mimosa pitcher was a nice.  The restrooms were clean. The server was able to ring us up separately. The server did forget a few items, and we had to ask a few times but it may have been due to the busy time that we were there.

I went with chicken eggs benedict, which is supposedly very similar to their brunch dish.  I wanted to try to get a feel for brunch without coming on a weekend.

My benedict was a very good option.  The other meals at Mesa Grill looked good and portion sizes were excellent.  At $18 for my meal, I think it was probably $3 too expensive, but celebrity chefs are able to get away with that.  Drink options were pretty limited and started at $14 so I didn't even try.

Ordered sin city burger and avocado burger. Sin City burger consists of greasy onion rings, overfried egg, greasy chunk of smashed ground beef and greasy soft bacon... It's 30 degrees outside so I managed to eat more than a half thinking that I'll have to burn calories outside anyway. But I couldn't make myself to touch fries. First they gave us lukewarm portion of greasy fries which I returned to the kitchen and asked for hot and not so greasy portion... instead I got another pile with poodle of oil on a bottom of the basket. For &&*! sake - is it possible to make a pile of potatoes right? It probably cost you 30c to make it so why can't it be edible at least. How come even McD does better job for 1/3 of the price?

I've gone to Smash a couple years ago with exactly the same result... I hoped something changed but alas no luck. The only bright side is that we had a 241 coupon so the total was only $12 for 2 (but I'd rather have gone to INO down the street for same money).

I chose this place because of its proximity to our show and because the girlfriend used to eat at the Portland location all the time. I guess it's tough to top a view of the Willamette, but the gargantuan aquarium that anchors the Vegas spot is a sweet feature. We were at the end of the tank and with the way the glass curved, watching the fish sometimes felt like a 3D movie.

We started our evening with a couple of cocktails. I had their version of a Bold Manhattan. The girlfriend had the Downtowner. The Manhattan was enjoyable but very sweet. I preferred the Downtowner (and indeed ordered my own).

As for food, we thought everything we ate was great. We shared the Roasted Beet Salad to begin our meal. The fact that they split it up onto two plates was a nice touch. Not quite as spectacular as we've had before, but excellent nonetheless. For the main course, I ordered the Bronzed Swordfish while the girlfriend chose the Tour de Shrimp. We accompanied that with their Asian Green Beans and Gorgonzola Risotto. Everything was well-cooked and well-seasoned. No complaints whatsoever. And the plentiful leftovers were just as delicious the next day.

Ever since I saw Superman II as a kid, I always wanted to eat a soufflé but just never got around to it I guess. So it was a must that we tried their Chart House Soufflé. It was much too sweet for me, though the server did warn us about that. Luckily, the Grand Marnier Crème Anglaise complemented it perfectly. You're supposed to choose a sauce, but the server allowed us to have all three on the side. The raspberry had a nice tartness to it that also helped break up the sweetness of the soufflé.

My greatest disappointment was the realization that something... changed... about this place from the mostly positive earlier Yelp reviews to those that have appeared within the last week or so. 

Kitchen 73 is located near the heart of Laval just off busy St-Martin street in a building that showcases a large modern interior without the warmth and color I'm used to when visiting other breakfast themed locations. 

As it was Monday morning, plenty of seating was available. Awesome!

Firstly, the service was from start to end was professional, quick and accommodating. Coffee refills were taken care of quickly and follow-up needs met.

The major problem we encountered was pretty much the food.... which in itself... is actually BRINGS me to this restoraunt. I went with the strawberry crepe and my wife the choco-banane waffle. We were both dismayed by how bad the meal was considering the value we got for the price we paid.

The crepe was decent enough though the strawberries weren't as good as they can be and the English cream, which lacked actual taste was way too liquidy. My wife's waffle was decent enough as well but the chocolate felt ""off"", as if it were some poor imitation of actual chocolate. We were both seriously wondering when we left if the ingredients we got served were of the best quality as they can be.

Secondly, both our meals came with no sides. Usually, you'd get a side of potatoes, fruits, toasts or whatnot but both our meals didn't. It was a crepe filled with fruits and a waffle with some banana & chocolate. Coffee was included. 

Perhaps we were previously spoiled elsewhere in our experiences and it's unfair to compare places to ALLO MON COCO but I can tell you for the $15 a plate we paid that this no where comes close to competition barely a few blocks away. A $15 plate with strawberry crepes elsewhere would come with fruits, potatoes, beans, toasts and whatnot.

So ultimately my experience was an average, overpriced breakfast with great service. Truth be told, I expected more and sadly for Kitchen 73, I won't be back anytime soon.",2014-02-25 23:28:22

I could tell Jasmine was really confident in her craft; and the results showed.

She went back 2-3 times on each brow just to get those little itty bitty hairs that other threading shops just let get by. After she was done, she massaged aloe into my brows- this was the icing on the cake.

The only reason this place wasn't a 5-star establishment were pretty minor; 1) Jasmine didn't ask how I wanted my brows shaped- something I know some women are particular about and 2) she had issues entering my LivingSocial promo and could tell she was a little flustered- the problem wasn't handled gracefully (she ended up realizing the promo wasn't entered in correctly and the situation resolved itself).

It's OK, I thought, Common House turned out some pretty good burgers in its day. So I decided to give it a chance.

I won't make that mistake again.

First, the menu: Everything has some kind of bike-ish name, except for the cocktails, which are all named after old movie stars (and Clint Eastwood). I don't really get it.

We decided to start with the cheese fries, which came with a healthy topping of queso I'm guessing came from Loco Lime next door and a sparse sprinkling of bacon and green onions. The fries themselves are pretty solid and the bacon isn't bad, but fries + cheese sauce = a soggy mess.

Next came our burgers. I got a plain cheeseburger and my friend got the stuffed burger. My burger was dry and kind of tasteless. My friend said his burger was overwhelmed by the horseradish mayo and that the stuffing wasn't anything but a gimmick. As for our sides, the fries, again, were pretty good. I got the combo tater tots. The regular tots were fine--nothing special--but the sweet potato tots dipped in the maple butter sauce... It's the first time in my life I've ever wanted to spit something out a restaurant. It's a combination of flavors that just don't work and the tots themselves have an odd texture.

There's nothing at Kickstand you can't get elsewhere--and better--at all the other burger bars in Charlotte. There's nothing about this place that has me coming back for seconds.",2010-10-09 13:10:53

In an attempt to lessen the wait time, we agreed at check-in to take a take inside or out, but almost regretted doing so as we realized how unexpectedly chilly it was. The patio diners seemed happy enough though. Not even everyone was using the cozy-looking blue blankets that were provided. Luckily, we got a table inside.

Two waters each (why I'm not sure, but we weren't going to make a fuss) as well as coffee (with a side of milk) and tea (with a side of soy) were brought pronto to warm (and wake) us up. The benedicts we opted for - mine with smoked salmon and pickled asparagus, my brunch date's with avocado and roasted red pepper, both with medium eggs - were just perfect. Simply sided with tiny little cubes of crispy home fries and a gooseberry garnish, the dishes were deliciously filling. 

Besides the varied menu, fast and friendly service, and cozy decor, the fact that Dairy Lane sources almost all of its ingredients locally and organically leaves pretty much nothing else to be desired (except for the ability to wake up earlier to beat the crowds).",2010-08-24 04:08:22

There's about 3 full tables that could sit 4, 1 or 2 small tables to sit 2, a bench for take-out orders, and 1 table outside. Ok, that actually sounds like a sufficient amount of seating...but this place is really popular! 

Anyway, hit it up, no ragrets!

This place is very clean, well organized, well stocked, and has a crazy amount of selection.  It also has a kitchen upstairs for birthday parties and lessons, a women's only Good Life, a huge Joe Fresh area, wine, optometrist, florist, and take out section.  

The take out is just ok. I find the Loblaws to be better. Their rotisserie chicken wasn't dry but just lacked flavour. They have a fish seafood section. Usually it's ok. I find T&T to be far superior but occasionally, I will buy frozen shrimp at good prices. The fresh produce here is the best out of all the Superstore I've been to. Good selection and quality. It's on par of better than most Loblaws. The butcher section isn't bad and you can find a lot of different cuts for fair prices. The organic and international food selection is amazing here. I can find all my T&T grocery list here now and at very comparable prices! I also buy a decent amount of organic items from this store. It has a wide selection for reasonable prices.

As has been said, there has been a change of ownership. I was never there before so don't know how that was.

I do know that I am in love with it now.

This is authentic Northern style (Shaanxi ) Chinese food. Some of the staff have limited English so probably best to come armed with some dish recommendations. Definitely look for Helen Y's review for some more ideas. 

We had a variety of dishes on our first visit. 2 stood out strongly.

The Shaanxi-Style Handmade Noodle dish (#52) was fantastic. The noodles were amazing & they were topped with chiles, soybean sprouts, boy choy and vinegar. So good. A bit salty but I'm a fan of salt.

Our other favorite dish was the Hot & Sour Pork Dumpling Soup (#50). This was a recommendation from our server. This was absolutely wonderful. Excellent tasty dumplings with lovely wrappers (that would have been great on their own) in a yummy broth with vinegar, sesame oil & lots of cilantro. This was brilliant. I saw after we ordered that they also have this dish with lamb dumplings. 

We also had the Shaanxi Pan-Fried Noodles (#54) on a recommendation from our server. A nice dish. A bit sweet, a bit of heat (sliced jalapenos), pork & onions. I like these noodles but liked the handmade noodles in the first dish even better. Definitely nothing to sneer at.

And then our first recommendation from our server after pointing at the Shaanxi-Style Handmade Noodles was Kung Pao Chicken (#30). It was good but we couldn't get over some of the other dishes. We'll be digging more on the noodle side in future visits.

On our second visit, we had to get the Hot & Sour Pork Dumpling Soup again and it was as amazing as the first time.

We also ordered the Tomato Egg Soup (#14). This was lovely. I'm glad it came out before the hot & sour dumpling soup as its flavor was far more delicate. I'd be happy to eat this again for certain. 

More exploring to come!

Fettucini Rose with snow crab and ikura was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good amount of crab meat and the sauce had a very rich, deep, crab flavour.By far the best entree we ordered.

Sukiyaki pasta tastes a bit like beef ramen. It was tasty, but TOO SALTY unfortunately.

Lastly, my other two friends got the Carbonara and the Smoked Salmon alla vodka, and both cream sauces were EXTREMELY BLAND and not palatable. Would not recommend these dishes.

I'm suffering from a bad case of burger fatigue. That said, Whataburger serves a quality (for fast food) burger. If you're complaining, with all the options Whataburger offers, you just didn't order it correctly. I always ask for grilled onions.

Breakfast is served until 11:00 a.m. What distinguishes Whataburger from other fast food breakfasts is their limited use of the microwave oven. Order pancakes, and you will receive pancakes freshly prepared on the spot, not pulled out of a freezer and zapped. Since they operate more like an old style short order cook, they'll customize virtually anything for you. Want your bacon crisp? No problem. Want a side of scrambled eggs? No worries.

The people at this location are very nice. I used to take my mother here for breakfast 2-3 times a week when she was a snowbird. She loved the free senior coffee and we'd split a meal. Always out the door for $6-8, which is what a nice breakfast for two cost in 1973, the benchmark year to which she seems to compare prices. The staff would often help me with her wheelchair and engage her small talk, a big deal when you're disabled. I was surprised, well maybe not that surprised, to see one of the same nice servers still there on this recent visit. 

It's also great that you can settle in and read... while waiting for your breakfast to be prepared. They deliver it hot to your table when ready. It may take a minute or two longer than the microwave competitors, but it's worth it. The dining room is also much more relaxing since they updated it and said goodbye to the Whataburger orange and blue!

I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.

Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.

Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.

FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the ""10 minute"" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. 

That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.

I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.

***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of ""sat"" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.

S4RiLsFjZGxvezLMc4IWUw,ERQFnnQ-JDx2MqCOp2oaCA,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,2,1,0,0,"Went there for the Late Happy Hour (food not drinks) for the first time on a Saturday night, I got seated in less than 5 minutes. 

    So I returned a few nights later, this time on a Thursday night around 9:30PM for their late happy hour and it was a whole different experience.  Hostess had attitude which I didn't appreciate.  I asked how long the wait was since I didn't see a line  and she said ""many ahead of you"".  Where were the many?? Since she didn't tell me if I was 3rd or 20th on the list I had no way of knowing who she was seating ahead of me.  She quoted me a half hour wait, so I waited until 10o'clock and then went back to her and said can you seat me now, she said ""no still have to wait"".....Wait how long, where were the people that were before me .....hiding???  Finally after an hour's wait she sat us in a booth. I mentioned this to the General Manager Steve and he said there were lots of reservations and that there were still 10 more people with reservations to be seated after me.  Since they close at 11 o'clock on Thursday, and I was seated at 10:30 how were they going to accommodate everyone.  Well after I was seated NO ONE ELSE CAME IN.  So I was the last table seated, so there wasn't any reservations after me, I was just put last and I didn't appreciate that
     Now for the food which is most important, the sushi rolls were not the same as they had been.  The crunchy roll which is so good wasn't packed right, instead of being a circle it was an open circle so when you picked it up all the filling fell out and we had to scoop it back in.  The California roll was made the same, I thought they had run out of rice since there was hardly any rice wrapped around the roll, but the manager said when they are busy they don't pack the bottom of the roll tight enough.???? so what does that mean??? The garlic chicken came to the table lukewarm instead of piping hot so it lost some of its flavor.  The lettuce chicken wraps were OK.
     The attitude of the hostess sort of ruined the whole dining experience and then the food coming out less than perfect added to the unpleasantness. We did mention this to Steve who is the G.M.  He apologized, but that didn't change the fact that we didn't enjoy our dinner and the hour wait to be seated.  I don't know if I will go back since I didn't like the food the second time and also I don't appreciate being told ""Many ahead of you"" when I saw no one, and then quoted a time frame of 1/2 hour but got seated when the restaurant was going to close.  
     So I guess its who you know there, or who the hostess feels like sitting first.  At a reputable restaurant they usually tell you how many parties are ahead of you, or else you are told 1/2 hour and then you are seated. I have never been told ""Many ahead of you"" and with the food not being up to par I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, unless maybe you are on a first name basis with the hostess who seems to have more power and attitude than the General Manager..   The food wasn't worth the wait.",2015-09-25 21:53:52

It started with the hostesses stand. Our reservation was at 8pm. We arrived 7:48pm. It appeared we were the first to get there as the waiting area was empty. The hostess said ""we will work on getting you seated in a few minutes."" Sounds reasonable. Apparently working on getting us seated consisted of gabbing with the other hostess. Come 8pm, the lobby is packed. Overly full as reservations go unseated. Finally our name is called. We stand up, hostess takes two steps and starts calling other names. Confusing situation as there were NO words once we approached her explaining she was calling everyone who was going to be at our table as we awkwardly stand there. So now that all 8 (4 groups of 2) of us are lined up like kids in a packed lobby we got dropped at our table. Was it too much to maybe sit us 2 by 2 or maybe 2 groups of 4? It felt like a teacher calling the kids to go on to the cafeteria for lunch. 
Our server seemed extremely disinterested in being there and had a very withdrawn attitude. She was nice, but I didn't order more than the necessary to avoid disrupting her. Food was good. I just found myself so annoyed by the seating situation it put me in a bad mood.",2018-08-05 17:13:32

Today was the first time I visited the establishment and the only reason I went was because a friend of mine told me they did psychic readings there. I was super intrigued so made a call this morning to meet with Gail, who was out of town, therefore not available until Saturday. Because of my work schedule, I decided I would meet with someone else (I believe her name was Lisa) who happens to be a ""medium."" In hopes of connecting with my ex (who also was my best friend) who passed away a few months ago, I agreed to meet with this other person and went in with an open mind. She started by asking me what I do for a living (I work for a bank). She starts laying out her tarot cards and I felt like she just started making things up. She starts talking about my specific branch and the funds that are kept in reserve, etc. First off, I work for the corporate office....not a branch. So that was strike 1. I asked her to move on to the medium part of the reading and she starts telling me about how my grandparents are coming through and they're ok, blah blah blah. Both sets of my grandparents are still alive....so that was strike 2. She then asks me who I wanted to connect with on the other side. I gave her my ex's first name (and only his name...I didn't even tell her that he was my ex or best friend) and she starts telling me that he says a romantic life with him wasn't possible because of something personal like his sexual orientation. My ex and I were together for many years and I can tell you, he was as straight as an arrow and we had no issues with our romantic life (even after we broke up). That was strike 3. I told her I was ready to end the reading early and that was the end of it. I told the girl at the front desk that it was the worst reading I ever had.
Because of the girl who worked the front desk/answered phones, I'm not giving this place 1 star. She saved you with how awesome and nice she was. The store was pretty fantastic too (lots of incense and cool books). But the reading was so terrible, I will never attempt another reading there again.",2016-02-25 23:01:34

The house sauce for the beef is to die for. It's a homemade soy rice wine and perfectly complements the meat. 

There is a bone-in 12oz fillet that you wouldn't know it was there unless the wait staff tells you about it. It's not a special, it's just not on the menu. The truffled mashed potatoes are excellent - very rich. The gulf shrimp wrapped in bacon as an appetizer was good. 

Inside is stated decor. We sat outside on the patio, overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio. We had a new show every 15 minutes.

The waiters will bring you menus once you are seated. You go to the back to pay for food and drinks or to the bar for drinks, and they will give you a number and bring your food and drinks to you. The food took about 15 mins to arrive.  There are a variety of sausages. We tried the duck with foie gras sausage (really good), rabbit (very gamey. Didn't like it very much), bacon wrapped sausage (comes in pieces. Pretty good), and the duck fries (a large portion but kinda soggy). 

We had a bottle of cider and tried the tart and funky cider flight. The name definitely fit. It was funky alright! 

I liked wvrst n will go again to try other things on the menu. The price is definitely affordable.  I give it a 3/5 because it didn't stand out to me as a must go place.

Having attending many musicals and operas throughout the years I was interested in seeing one that I had not before and especially one that was considered a folk opera.  Being given free tickets in Row U of right center was nice as you were close enough to the stage that you were happy and yet far enough away that you were not right on top of the performance. 

Unfortunately the musical started out as a bit of a downer as the performance started at 7:45 instead of the 7:30 noted on the tickets.  For a little while I was wondering what was going on as almost everything I have ever attended at the Benedum has started on time.  Once the musical started though it was all good as I really enjoyed the first half of the performance.  I am not sure that I have seen a performance like this before with the combination of music seeming to be random, yet good with switches from parts in opera to other parts with a jazz or blues feel. The only problem that I had during the first half was that I was having a hard time hearing the female opera singers voice.  The second half of the show was quite a different story for me than the first half.  I felt that the energy dipped and that combined with me getting tired and the Benedum temperature rising left me wishing that performance would end quicker than it did.  That wasn't indicative of the performers though as they did a wonderful job throughout the night and I really enjoyed most of the singing and dancing.  It was more due to the story and music at that part of the story.

The bottom line for me is that I would encourage others to see this show in the future.  It may not be the first show that I would recommend but I felt that it was good and is something different than most of the shows you get today,",2014-02-26 23:07:23

The restaurant itself is smaller and more intimate and the best part is that it's BYOB. Because of it's size, many of the tables (including ours) are located near the door, which offered us a nice breeze of the cold, breezy weather each time the door opened.

The food: I ordered the hummus as an appetizer and while it was good (it's hard to mess up hummus), I was not blown away. It tasted like hummus from a grocery store that added a little olive oil on the bottom of the dish and garnished. Choosing dinner was a tough decision because the special sounded great (stuffed chicken), but I worried that it would be something the chef wanted to get rid of, so I ordered the lamb burger. I was pretty happy with the burger, as the lamb tasted great and flavorful and the feta cheese was fresh. The fries were good, but incredibly salty. Going back to the ""special"" comment ... my friend ordered it and it was exactly what I was afraid of. It was clearly ingredients that the chef wanted to get rid of. The chicken looked overcooked and was completely blanketed in a sauce that hid the dish. The portion size was small as well as the sides - mashed potatoes and vegetables. The overall meal presentation was terrible and clearly lacked any cohesion. They did not enjoy it as nearly as much as they hoped to, yet paid the full $20 (my burger? $9).

Here is where my review takes a somewhat downward turn and really makes me take the star away. I got the walnut cake as dessert after the server came back to tell me there was one piece left. This was an amateur mistake on my part as the cake was incredibly dry (although maybe the cake always is) and I couldn't stomach eating the rest.

Overall, I was pleased. Not sure I'll make a point to go back and I definitely wasn't blown away, but I didn't leave totally unhappy. If you're in the area and really want to try something outside of a chain restuarant, Mediterrano might be a good stop.",2012-03-07 14:00:36

While the service was outstanding, the quality was mediocre when comparing it to other similar, better located, places in Vegas.  Price hurts a little too...guess the uberMall rents are high so the costs need to be passed along to the diners.

We arrived a little after noon and were told that the wait would be 45 minutes. I inwardly groaned when I learned that they used the No Wait app. If only I had known and had checked in!

We spent our wait time strolling around Lawrenceville on a (very unexpected!) pretty day in January. The wait was a bit longer than the 45 minute estimate - closer to an hour - and I was suspicious when I walked back into the restaurant and saw the same large table still open in the front dining room. Did they just not seat us (or anyone else) there because our parties were too small?

I started with a glass of orange juice. It was really quite delicious, but I was very disappointed in the glass size (6 or 8 oz maybe?) that cost $3.95. I expected a much larger glass of juice for that price.

I ordered the chicken and pancakes as it sounded like a nice balance between sweet and savory. The fried chicken was actually chicken thighs. The chicken was so greasy that I had a tough time even eating half of my serving and still felt a bit sick to my stomach for the rest of the day. The pancakes were descent but just too heavy. I expected a lighter, tastier pancake to be served by a place that specializes in breakfast/brunch.

Though I had a nice time with my friend, I just wasn't blown away by the food or beverage that I ordered. However, my friend ordered an omelet and cleaned her plate.

Some weird gang activity happens at nights. It does not feel safe anymore. You have to watch your back if you workout after dark and it's very uncomfortable.
When I walked in last night, there were no towels. There was a big container full of towels and honestly I could not tell if they were clean or not. The front desk clerk, who was busy on his cellphone told me to get the towels from the container. I hope they were clean. The stair step machines are extremely dirty with sweat stains, you have to cover the handles with towels just to make sure you don't touch any previous sweat. Half of the treadmills don't work and the equipment is run down and dirty.

The bread is easily better than the one at Bamiyan, and the portions are generous.

For me, in particular, since I had three virgin cocktails, Garnet Gimlet (I should have had this over ice), Platinum Peacock (my fave, very refreshing), and Ruby Iced Tea (tart).  Hubby was a bit over-buzzed after The Woodson, Goose IPA, and the Garrison.  

Ranking from Most to Least Favorites:
1. Elote Style Scallops: Scallops were perfectly cooked on top of charred elote.  Delicous!
2. Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème: Just the right amount of richness.  Ooh, a piece of heaven with this dessert.  The ganache at the bottom adds a different texture to this elevated pot de crème.  Came with a spoon shaped thin cookie wafer.  A must order dessert.
3. Hand Cut Steak Tartare: The steak tartare was on top of crispy sticky rice cakes.  This was quite unique and flavorful.
4. East and West Coast Oysters: Ordered the dozen and got to try all fresh raw oysters.  Very satisfying.
5. Roasted Bone Marrow: Spread the marrow on some grilled toast, then topped with coarse salt and shallots marmalade...Yum!
6. Yellowtail Sashimi: Latin spin on this plate.  The sashimi was topped with pickled jalapeno and the ponzu sauce gave it some acidity.  I had to really try hard to taste the fish, but the flavor profile was there.
7. Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Tomato Soup Dumpling: I liked this rendition.  The dumpling was nice and chewy.  
8. Caesar Toast: Exactly that, except there are pieces of crispy chicken skin.  It delivered, yet, I wasn't satisfied.
9. Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche: When I think of Ceviche, I think of lime cured salmon.  This plate was just sweet.  It was missing the acidity that I am accustomed to, as well as salt.  A miss for me.
10. Kygo Cloud 9 S'Mores: WAY TOO RICH!  Need a glass of milk with this.  Overly sweet too.  Bleh!

Have brunched here and was very happy with my avocado and roasted red pepper benny, but the burgers! Let joy be unconfined. I had the Dairy Lane Burger today and since I had not eaten anything prior, decided to add everything on it.

That is right, I added: bacon, cheese, mushrooms and a fried egg.
This burger was so very, very good. I think even if I had been stingy and just eaten it with no extras, it would have held up nicely on its own. The bun itself was delectable, I am trying to think how to describe it, like a cheese, savoury bun, OMG it also was able to take the pounding my burger toppings gave it.

I think Dairy Lane deserves a big plus for their menu's accommodation, you can get gluten free buns, and they actually have vegan dishes. So nice to see a brunch (and dinner!)  able to ensure all its guests have a great meal.

Another big plus is it's licensed, I will never say no to a nice bottle of beer to wash my burger down.

This is essentially a mountain of poutine with duck meat, curds and fries on top of pizza crust.  It's literally overwhelming, but hits the ""little fat man in me"" spot.

There are exercise stations all over, but many of them need updates (cracked mats, and just basically run down).  I hope pet owners are smart enough to keep their pets away from these areas.  Who wants to do squats, lunges, push-ups, and other maneuvers, and/or lay their hands on equipment dogs have urinated on??  

Watch out for runners and bicyclists.  It's nice that most of them call out from behind you to tell them where they plan on passing you-- there have been a few who did not.  Also, be aware that you might encounter a coyote here.  My friend and I were approached by one two weeks ago.  My friend was very disturbed and tried her best to scare it away, but it just kept on coming closer.

This started occuring about 1 week after my oil change here. We checked for leaks and found none. It took just a smidgen of fluid to make the noise stop altogether. 

Am I mistaken or shouldn't that be topped off during a standard oil change? Either which way, my whole experience with this place hasn't sat well with me since I left. Bluntly stated: This place reeks. I will never be back and certainly would not reccommend it to anyone at all. While I was waiting in the lobby, the manager was chatting with an older guy and talking about how much his trip to Disneyland was going to cost between the wife and kids. Makes me wonder if he wasn't trying to ""generate some extra revenue"" for his trip.  Of course there is no proof of that, but you have to trust your gut when you feel like someone is taking you for a ride.

The macaroons are under $3 a piece if you only want bags packaging. 

The texture of the macaroon was interest. It had 3 types of texture. The outside of the shell is crunchy, the middle of the shell is a bit moist, and the cream inside is creamy. I personally don't like the moist part because its too sweet. The matcha flavor does tastes like matcha though.

Interesting sculptures are around as well, including one outside.  The chicken kabob that I ordered came with a side salad, which was very large, and French fries.  I ordered hummus instead of the fries.  It was all tasty, but I must admit I was disappointed by the hummus.  With The Jasmine Grill setting hummus standard, as well as YAFO, they need to present their hummus in a more appealing way.  It was served in a little tiny cup, sort of like what ketchup is served in.   And I wish it was as silky as the other Mediterranean restaurants. That was my only disappointment.

There aren't many MALAYSIAN food places around Vegas, so I may be a little biased. I have never had any authentic Malaysian food either, so... I guess this may be going out on a whim, BUT... my experience here has been amazing!

They have an EXTENSIVE menu, and then a separate binder that has PICTURES... of EVERYTHING on the menu! Seriously, that made our selection process 50x easier! 

I can't remember everything we've had, but I know that the coconut rice is a must get, and so is the Roti Canai. YUM. 

Malaysian spices are more defined than Thai, since they use less coconut milk. I want to say that it's closer in taste to Indian cuisine, but not as bold. 

Anyway, the interior is very themed, and they have a little mini-pool set for children to play. On top of that, the service was beyond amazing.

The owner, which is also a server and cashier (but her name slips my mind... UGHH!) was extra nice, and VERY patient with us when we were making selections, and was not shy to offer her opinions on what we might like, and suggestions as well.

Service was good, and people checked on us regularly and refilled our waters. The menu wasn't huge, and I decided to pick one of their specialty dishes, lobster pho.

The pho comes with a whole lobster, and a decent amount of meat. While the dish was tasty overall, I was actually expecting the broth to be richer, considering that it was cooked with an entire lobster. 

The menu did say market price, and I knew lobster wouldn't be cheap, but the bowl of lobster pho ended up costing $49, and after tax and tip, I spent $61 on my meal. Not really worth it in my opinion. I could have bought an entire fresh lobster and made my own pho for under $30.

I felt there was a lot of novelty to be had here between the different sausages and the beer hall set up, but the counter service to tray situation was not my idea of how to eat out but essentially the low rating was because I didn't feel the sausages were any better than something from a hot dog cart on the street. 

I had the duck and foie gras sausage and my boyfriend had the kangaroo. They were both just ok. The sausage was very loosely packed and I found myself enjoying the bun and sauerkraut more since they had a lot more flavour than the meat.

I was excited to try the duck fat fries. They were good, but not what I expected: when I make duck fat potatoes at home they have the rich flavour of duck-- no doubt from the pan drippings. I get that they likely use clarified duck fat, but the flavour of them was no different than any other french fry. There was a definite lack of distinctive crunch or crispiness.

I didn't enjoy the wait in line, the ordering at the counter and the seek your own seat. Especially the latter, which was nerve wracking and took me back to high school cafeteria days, trying to pick who to sit with. Communal seating is not a favourite thing of mine, unless I'm actually in a German Beer Hall  in Bavaria. But getting to choose who you sit with is far too political an experience to engage in amongst North American strangers on King St. At least for this gal.

Luckily, we sat at the bar proper, and I found some relief from my agoraphobia, claustrophobia and belated high school anxiety in a cider.

We walked on in and sat on the lounge side (apparently children are allowed on the other) Overall I thought that our waitress was friendly and service was good - however there were a couple short comings....

I was delivered the incorrect beer - no big deal really, our waitress was good about it and took the other one away and got me the one I wanted. The second thing that bothered me was we got 2 starters and 2 mains all at once... where is the timing/spacing? I mean, our table was a bit small to begin.

We ordered the shrimp cake sliders which were small but pretty tasty, the ale & cheddar dip (which I found very heavy and did not like the flavour) was delivered to us warm not hot and was already separating... 

For mains, the better half got the stacked reuben and I ordered the beet salad, these were both pretty tasty but what you would expect for pub food.
Would I go back? Eh. One generic pub is usually like another, but If I want a beer and find myself at Cross Iron again... chances are high due to slim choices.",2014-05-08 15:42:42

When we walked in I liked how it wasn't so stuffy and you didn't hear loud sounds from fans like other kbbq places. Several people asked how we heard about this restaurant so we told them from a friend and also from yelp.

From the moment we sat down we received excellent service. The owner and chef even came out a few times to say hello and check how we were enjoying our meal.

We ordered a combo A and also added kalbi afterwards. Everything was delicious and it was a surprise that our server cooked for us the whole time. I enjoyed that when we asked which sides were good she explained which sides were best with the meats. Also, we did ask for refills on many sides and they were more than happy to grab them for us no questions asked.

We were debating about whether or not to make Americano's or drip coffee whenever I remembered a Groupon for a local coffee shop.  So after purchasing the Groupon we headed over there.  The inside of this place is quite spacious and has a lot of nice seating options from couches to an old diner type counter to a bar by the windows and even more.  Suffice it to say that my wife and I both loved the interior.  The barrister's here were also quite friendly and helpful.

For my breakfast I went with the key lime scone and an Americano while my wife went with an Americano and a nutella peanut butter muffin.  I started off with my scone which was quite large and hard on the outside while soft on the inside.  It was quite enjoyable although I am not so sure that I got any of the key lime taste.  After finishing my scone I tried my coffee and I have to admit that it was pretty bitter.  Thinking that it may have to do with the scone I just ate, I tried to cleanse my palate before trying it again.  Nope, still super bitter.  I am not sure if it was the coffee itself or whether the espresso had been over-extracted.  My wife thought the same so I am hoping it was just a bad batch of coffee.  She did enjoy her muffin though.

The bottom line for both me and my wife is that we would stop by here again in the future.  We both loved the space (5 stars) and service (5 stars) so would like to give the coffee (2 1/2 stars) another chance.",2014-12-01 01:33:10

I am sad that I waited to long to try them.  We had been out on a hike and came here after for breakfast.

We decided to share a Quiche Lorraine with a side salad.  We got the Watermelon Lemonade for our drink.  
  The Watermelon Lemonade was really good.  The Watermelon was the stand out flavor with the lemon flavor being in the background.  Honestly I normally wouldn't have chosen a drink like this but wow was I impressed!  Our order come out pretty quick and we were in for a treat.  The baguettes for both of our sandwiches were so good.  Good bread is so hard to come by and this was a welcome treat.   Of course both sandwiches were delicious.  The omelet was perfect size and fluffy.  Perfectly cooked and really hit the spot.  The Chicken Curry sandwich was really good too.  The curry was spot on.  It added to the flavor but was not overpowering.   
   The Quiche Lorraine was amazing.  Light and fluffy and so tasty. Many places over cook their quiche but not here - perfection is the way they roll!

I wasn't playing attention to the food. The heat of day was killing us. We wanted to get out of the house. The taste of that spaghetti is what caught my attention. How I do not understand? Esther's Kitchen is one of the first restaurants that inspired me to come home and write. The owner of a bar on Fremont Street Experience told me that Esther's Kitchen repeatedly. He claimed the pasta dishes made Esther's the best restaurant in town and he was Italian. He loved Italian food. The casino owner I met with at the Nevada Business Forum monthly meetings talked about the stylish new restaurant. The owner of a PR firm invited me to lunch. When we arrived late, the doors were closed. Everyone is talking about eating at Esther's. Friends I work with around the corner at LVNET High Speed Internet asked me, ""You haven't gone to Esther's Kitchen yet? Their pasta is homemade. It is the best in town."" First, yesterday was my first time in Esther's Kitchen and already I want to go back for lunch if they are open. The spaghetti with basil and sun gold tomatoes surprised me. I wasn't paying attention to the dish, the way it looked, or the ingredients. I was studying the girl on a date next to me, when I found myself surprised at how good the pasta was. The spaghetti was incredible. I love Chicago Joe's pasta. I often enjoy eating Italian pasta at Bootlegger Bistro, Sienna Deli on Sahara, but Nevada leaders are telling me to try out Esther's Kitchen and now I understand. Now I know why all the restaurants are threatened by the competition of Esther's Kitchen. Vegas is a home to acts. Action speaks louder, because local expect a performance. The chefs were showing the viewers how they used sauces. The chefs were grating cheese over the plates in a theater like stage at the north end of the restaurant. Whereas the bartender seemed to be performing over glasses with fresh, green herbs, diced cherry dishes with sweet syrups, all the glasses were cool with a chill to escape the heat. As the bartender artistically took his time to create the most sophisticated drinks over giant cubes, single blocks of ice that fit the dimensions of a glass like the points of a pentagram arranged around a circle. The bartender's confident nature was hip, chic, creating an atmosphere as aristocratic as clownish in a vaudeville fashion as he stirred cocktail spoons between in fingers over two separate glasses. My girlfriend was a little turned on by his performance. His mastery was obvious. The style inside was an intellectual flare from the books on a wooden shelf as you walked into the door to the way the hostess held the door as we left. Turn from your table to the south and diners will see the Stratosphere casino lit up red, white, and blue like a landmark torch facing south towards the Las Vegas Strip. My girl had been craving mushrooms. The sherry with truffle butter was unbelievable. Again, we did not know what we were eating with the mushrooms; Mashed potatoes? Grits? The taste of the sherry soaked mushrooms over a grain that we couldn't put our finger on. Polenta! The mushrooms were served over a house ground polenta, which we would have never expected. I had to reread the menu to see what we were eating. Perfect, the polenta had a fabulous texture, dimension, and added to the combination. The bed of mashed corn with a taste under the truffle, sherry mushrooms was divine. The employees are all beautiful. The men handsome. The girls thought of returning alone when they weren't invited to the restaurant on dates. The service to the customers was ripe with real, genuine happy faces acting free spirited with the sophistication often experiences in fine dining restaurants in San Francisco. The workers looked confident. They knew their restaurant rocked as a popular new venue. As I stated earlier, I was inspired to write, and most restaurants don't do that for any publisher on a hot day in Vegas where the heat reaches 110 F degrees, but Esther's Kitchen stands apart, especially downtown off Main Street with the vintage clothing stores holding hands beside each other, breweries touched as Makers and Finders Coffee serves up breakfast, or the new Vesta Coffee Roaster that has a Porsche Club following on Sunday morning to show off sports cars with the name Porsche. Esther's Kitchen will be an epicenter attracting people to the taste of downtown. No other attraction will bring people south of Charleston Blvd the way this restaurant will. The experience can be better than a show. The dishes are truly magical. I am going to post this comment at 10:00 am, Wednesday, and then look at my watch to cancel all appointments around noon, so that I can return to Esther's Kitchen for lunch and try a new dish that has yet been undiscovered in Las Vegas.",2018-06-27 16:53:19

-Parking was fairly straightforward and free. When arriving, we took Loop 101 south, then Thomas east to 83rd south. Absolutely no traffic problems at 5:30 on a weekday. Much better than trying to fight rush hour on I-10 west. Getting out of the lot took about 10 minutes as we were parked right next to the west gate.

-Sound system was perfect. We were in section 204 and everything was crystal clear. Decent view of the stage for this large of a venue. This was my first time here. I prefer venues like Marquee and Club Red which are much smaller, but for big time national acts Desert Sky does the job.

-Concession and bathroom lines were almost nonexistent. Though based on the crowd composition I'm going to take a guess and say the women's room line was much longer than the men's room ;) 

The bad:

-Concession prices are out of this world. Plan on spending $11-15 PER BEER (!), $6 for a 1 liter water, and about $9-12 for an entree food item (I had a personal size pepperoni pizza which was decent, but not $9 decent). You're much better off pregaming somewhere else before coming to the show. This bullet point loses two stars alone. Vegetarian options are spartan: looked like just cheese pizza, a black bean burger, and a loaded nachos, plus a few other snack type items.

-Some of the seating sections carry 60+ seats in a row, so it takes some work if you need to get out of the section from the middle seats.

-The two outside sections and the very back of the seating areas are not under the overhang, so take this into consideration if you're coming to a daytime show.

Would I come back? Yes, if there was a band I *really* wanted to see. But I would do my eating and drinking elsewhere for one third of the price.",2015-05-28 02:43:21

Either way, the margarita was great!

The second time I came here was on Cinco de Mayo. The wait was an hour, but that was fine. We got a pitcher of frozen margarita. Except, it didn't come in a pitcher. It came in this giant clay vase. It wasn't very functional for pouring drinks into salted glasses, which is what some of us wanted.

I've gotten tacos both times here. The tacos are so good! There's this super spicy salsa that comes with it. It's too spicy for me, but it was pretty yummy.

First of all, you can not complain about the decor.  It is stunning and if you haven't been to Morocco, this place will give you a little taste of what it is like.  Opulent fabrics, crafts, vases and art work cover almost every inch of this place creating a cozy and romantic ambiance.  From the vibe, it is fantastic for a group as well as one on one with a honey.  Drapery delicately hangs from the ceiling and elegantly cascades around your cushioned booths which are very comfortable and relaxed.  A nice array of Arabic music plays in the background to complete the setting.  A perfect environment to casually enjoy our Caesars which by the way, they add their own special harissa seasoning to.

Before the food arrives, they bring you a lovely brass kettle and basin to wash your hands with, it is not a full blown soap and lather thing, just a kettle that is gently poured over your hands and a little basin to catch the water.  I wish the water was a bit warmer but it was still a nice little thing that you don't usually see at your run of the mill restaurant.

To start, we ordered an appetizer platter with a trio of phyllo pastries which are stuffed with your choice of three fillings.  We chose the spinach/cheese, shrimp, and eggplant.  The eggplant was divine, but my hubby hated the spinach one because the cheese was quite strong if you are not a fan of goat cheese. It is a huge a platter (6 large pieces) and I wish I knew that before we ordered it because by the time the main came I was stuffed!  

Our mains were also quite delicious with exception to the optional bread that we ordered for the chicken and veg tagine.  I found the bread too dense and fell apart very quickly and for $4 it is essentially a big heavy bun cut into quarters, next time we will order the rice.  I ordered a veg and chicken couscous tagine and thought it needed a little more sauce for the couscous as it was just a tad too dry for my liking but the flavours were hands down delicious and very thoughtfully prepared.

I would definitely come back!  The menu has many options and all of them sound more delicious than the next, just make sure you leave your house hungry, the servings are generous and will please a rumbly tummy!  

Our tab came out to about $85, and we didn't have coffee or dessert, but I would think that with those two extras you will be looking at a c note for a romantic dinner for two.

Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",2010-11-28 03:42:50

For the dinner... I had those folded thingies like the one in the picture... for the life of me, I cannot remember what they are called.  Mine had the corned beef and cabbage... It got rich quick... I couldn't even eat a quarter of it.  A friend had a salmon one that wasn't so rich, but tasted awesome. Another had the fish and chips, which I usually never try but tried there, and they were good.  So good that I went to another bar in Surprise and was pretty disappointed with their fish and chips.

You have the option to order a slice to go, a whole pizza/meal to go, or sit down and eat at their restaurant. We came around 11am on a Sunday, and were able to order a slice of pizza right away. It takes less than 5 minutes for them to reheat it in the oven for you, and we tried:

-Gotham (Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Mozzarella, Granda Padano, $5.50/slice, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five50-pizza-bar-las-vegas?select=hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q#hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q): Really salty. I wish they did a plain sausage and cheese by the slice since it was the pepperoni and salami that were salty. I wouldn't get this combination again.
-Forager (White Sauce, Mushrooms, Bacon, Whipped Ricotta, Spinach): Sadly, this was bland, and I wouldn't get this again.
-Special of the Day: BBQ Pulled Pork: This was the best out of the three pizzas. The bbq sauce was good, and the pulled pork tender. I would recommend this if they had it as a special again.
-Vegas Root Beer Float (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Butterfinger Crumbles, Boylan's Root Beer, $9): Good, but you only get a small cup for the price. I don't think I would order it again for $9.

Overall, you can get decent pizza here for a quick meal, but it won't be that cheap. The crust is pretty thin at least, but I didn't like most of their pre-made combinations, so most likely won't return.",2014-11-30 08:49:39

It was very easy to get to walking and we brought backpacks so it would be easier to carry our food back.  The store had lots of items that we could use during our 6 days as we had a full kitchen.  The prices for many items were cheaper than back home, such as eggs, margarine, and baked goods (a package of cookies for $1)! There was a good selection of fresh fruit and we picked up apples and bananas.  I also shopped in the Christmas section and got great deals on chocolates that were much cheaper than Walgreens and Ghirardelli store.

We also bought some of the fresh good to bring back to the hotel for a late lunch.  They had fried, BBQ, and another flavoured chicken with breasts and drumsticks for a reasonable price.  We also got Mozzarella sticks that weren't so good, and coleslaw which was decent.

At first, I sort of thought about it as a slightly suburban bar/bat mitzvah factory just north of downtown. I thought it would be fun for a one off event, but not really a place I would get excited about. Well, I was wrong. This place is the shit. From bowling, to mini golf to weird laser tag and rink happenings, this place really has a lot going on. Yes, you have to lean into the slightly dated-ness of it, but they sure know how to party. 

Beyond all of the fun extras, they also have a really decent kitchen! If you're looking to plan an event (from children's parties, to team building, to a raging stag and doe), they can pretty much do any kind of menu. Is it gourmet dining? No. But it's super fun, and they're open to try anything you can dream up.

Let's start with the decor of Funk's and a little history. If your from Fitchburg, you will know that there are not a lot of places that this location can sustain for some reason. It has been many businesses but all sort of the same style: A place to watch sports / pub.

Funk's is similar but adds a lot of its own flavor to make it unique. A whiff of New Orleans can be detected throughout the establishment with some unique artwork on the walls and photos. A pretty open layout is what you are welcomed with when walking into the ""front"" of Funk's, which can be a bit confusing the way its laid out in a small strip mall. Lots of tables that can accommodate a large group or just the two of you and a great, long bar that runs pretty much 75% of the length of the entire place! They have lots of giant TV's to watch whatever sporting event you need and a beer and liquor selection to match. Drinks are extremely well priced and plentiful! They even built a stage for live music with a lot of local talent to give you that night out you've always wanted. Next the food... and WOW THE FOOD!

I know what most of you are thinking... ""Small sports bar type place in Fitchburg? It's no Great Dane"" but you would be so very wrong. I have never EVER had a bad meal here and expect I wouldn't. Their menu sort of sticks to the basics but each one has its own unique twist that makes it a masterpiece. One of my favorites is the expertly crafted Cubano sandwich, which I of course have had multiple times. I've had assorted menu items in the past but just remember each one being spectacular. They also have a nice little patio to sit and enjoy your food or cocktails but it faces a bank but its still nice out there with the music playing.

The final piece and the biggest piece to why I gave this place 5 stars is the staff. These folks are some of the best people who I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. They are always so energetic, friendly, and extremely attentive. I've never been without water or drink any time I've been there. If it isn't busy they'll stop by where you are and just chat while always keeping an eye on other patrons and if someone else comes in.

Oh, btw, no massage or lotion applied at all. My nails were uneven and the paint job looked amateur. So onto my nails,  I'm so OCD about my nails, I admit. I never get paint on them, and I like them square cute. Not hard? I decided to get paint to match my toes today (new year, new change)? So again, no lotion or massage after the manicure. She starts painting and I thought for sure she would go back and correct the paint. She left paint off the entire way around my nails, I could've done a better job with my eyes closed.

She was a very nice girl and easy to talk to I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but how could you let someone walk out of your salon, with your name attached to this work?

I ordered a shrimp okinomiyaki and a cup of black sesame latte. 

Shortly after, salad came first. It was on the house. Basically the salad was lettuce leaves with a few carrot pieces and sesame salad dressing. It's a bit plain but the dressing tasted unique and it makes the simple rich. 

Then my order, Shrimp Okonomiyaki , arrived. It has a slice of toast on the side of the pasta. It is spaghetti sautéed with onion, shrimps and bacons. On top of the spaghetti, sauces like Japanese Mayonnaise and Steak sauce, were put on top of the spaghetti. These are the same kind of dressings one will use to make Okonomiyaki .

For a short while it felt tricky to find the business because it is located towards the back of the property complex. Parking was just right. When I came it, I was immediately overwhelmed with a scent that was a mixture of both hair dye and possibly some incense candles. After some time I got desensitized to the smell and since the facial was done in a closed room, I was able to stay away from it. The feel of the place seems stuck somewhere in the 90's. Restroom was clean though. 

Chong was incredible. She was very friendly and catered to one's skin type and preference. She will work with you. After the facial she even gave me pointers on how to care for one's skin. She was lovely. I'm definitely giving Chong 4 stars and if only I could give the place 3, I would.

So, I didn't try the rolls. During this Lenten season, I gave up sugar, both simple and complex, so no rice for me. However, I did try a wide spread, which was delectable.

FOOD:
Mmmmsashimi, you never let me down. Their sashimi platter was presented beautifully, with long strips of delicate fish, fashioned into rolls. Very fresh, no odor, and a lovely selection of your usual tuna, salmon, white fish, and mackrel. I also got the squid salad, which had just the right amount of ginger kick to it. The only disappointing part of my meal were the green mussels. I'd never seen this selection on a sushi menu before, so curious, I ordered them. They tasted just like regular mussels, but perhaps a bit more tough. Let-down. :( On the upside, they do make a fabulous dirty martini, and I hear good things about their $2 martini nights on Wednesdays. 

SERVICE: Attentive and playful, though not without fault. Was brought the wrong thing twice (wrong martini, and the clams nigiri-style instead of sashimi), but both instances were fixed in no time at all. We did feel like we were being rushed out towards the end. We did spend a while talking after the meal, but there were plenty of seats available, and we were still tossing back a few drinks, so it shouldn't have been an issue.

ATMOSPHERE: Chique, club-like atmosphere, with bold colors, modern lighting, and a very nice back-lit bar. The sushi bar seems a little secluded from the rest of the restaurant, but overall, this place has a modern and sexy feel to it. 

PRICE: Average pricing for all items, but great deals on the specials mentioned beforehand. Definitely worth checking out.

Overall:
It's nice to know there's a  place where I stuff my face with decent sushi even when I'm broke. Thank you, Akahana.",2011-03-23 17:06:20

so i took our  little kitty kitty meow meow to the vet to get her checked out, since she's been chillin on our front porch, in our stairwell, and sometimes sneaks in my house.  she doesn't leave.  so i thought why not help her out, cuz she's adorable and needs a home.

this is the vet i went to.

what a great place.  everyone was so nice.  overly nice.  make new friends nice.  and they go over and beyond to make sure the animals are taken care of.  the hospital works a little differently than places you may have taken your pet to.  there are no previously made appointments, like justin said.  so i just put kitty kitty meow meow (yes, that's what her name is) in a cage and took her up one night to get her checked out.

the vet was thorough, kind, attentive, and accomodating.  a bit weird to be in one big room while they get checked out, but the cat didn't seem to mind, so i didn't either.

and the good news?  meow squared has no diseases, is about a year old, and has no fleas or ticks...and has now been vaccinated against the ickies that can get to kitties.

...and meow squared is not a she. she's a he.  oops.  what can i say.  i've done the arts before, i get confused sometimes.

---

I curiously popped in for breakfast one morning, since I had gotten to work a bit early, and it's conveniently within walking distance.  When I walked in, I was greeted with two things:  a friendly smile, and a massive menu.  I ended up going with a classic -- bacon egg and cheese biscuit.  It looks a lot smaller than it actually is, because it filled me up, to my surprise.  And it was delicious.  Super flavorful, everything you could want in a hearty breakfast sandwich.

I liked it so much that I told my friend about it, and we went a couple hours later for lunch.  Lucky for me, they had the Thursday special -- Fried chicken, bread, and two sides.  The server kept suggesting it, so how could I say no???  My friend got a cheeseburger.

They bring the plate out, and it's the biggest helping of food I'd had in a while.  MASSIVE chicken breast.  Served with not one, but TWO scoops of mashed potatoes and gravy, and mac & cheese.  Hush puppies were a bread item.  

Pure.  Southern.  Bliss.  My friend's cheeseburger was 10 oz.  Gigantic too.  You get a serious bang for your buck here.  I really enjoyed the sides, and the fried chicken was good, but I felt that it could've been more flavorful.  Kinda overhyped, at least for me.  But hey, everything else was excellent!

One more thing to note, they've got Panthers memorabilia hanging around the store.  Autographs from literally every big Panther.  It's a nice touch.

Overall, a pretty cool place.  I've gotta try their BBQ next time.",2016-08-14 04:16:21

$13 for locals, and it took us about 10-15min to walk through the entire place, taking a little time to check out each piece of art and reading the commentary.

The fish is always fresh and you can get it cleaned and tidied up after you pay, on the side.  The people working behind the counters are always so helpful and informed about the seafood and what would be good pairings.  They sell crab cakes uncooked and cooked ones, both for $3.75 each, although do keep in mind they are smaller than the ones they would serve you next door.  They have a large, well-stocked variety of dried/shelf goods - canned soups, wasabi, hummus, caviar.

Their fridges are stocked with oysters and clams usually by the 5 dozen, crab legs, stuffed crab shells, bags of frozen scallops, smoked salmon, etc.

Typically, they have around a dozen types of oysters out, in addition to clams, sea urchins, and scallops out on the glass.  Their prices are very, very reasonable in comparison with their restaurant next door.  Their medium Fanny Bay (BC) was $15.99 per dozen today and another medium BC one was $22.99 per dozen.  You can't just get one or two though, it's by the half dozen, which /can/ be a little hard if you only have one or two at the table.

So I came here based on Amanda M's review.  

What I liked:
-Underground
-Nice clean communal table
-They have 1/2 sandwiches for under $3 so you don't need to eat an entire sandwich
-It's somewhat reasonable price (got a 1/2 sandwich and soup for $6.71 incl. tax)
-The chicken tortilla soup was quite good.  It had a bit of kick to it. 
-They are like a coffee shop, soup, salad and sandwich place in one. 

What I disliked:
-It's not as cheap as Salad House or Salad Days 
-The spicy chicken sandwich (1/2) wasn't spicy as all and I thought it was a bit small for a 1/2 sandwich.  

Overall, I think this is a solid ""feel good"" type of place that's cheaper than Freshii and healthier than Panera.  Not a bad bet.  Just don't expect huge portions.",2014-07-15 20:53:50

I woke up last night at 8 pm and wanted Sushi too late to drive to Trop and Topaz so we decided to try Lahaina Grill again after not having been in 2 years. It has become""Leo's wok and roll"" but maintains the brand of Lahaina Grill. The Sushi Chef  was a 4 day old employee. He was not attentive,his rolls were small and everything had a sauce that tasted like the last sauce. We could get no connection with him. Never introduced himself. Spent his time watching the all stars game or on his phone.
Did not care for his hygine when handling the fish as well we were sitting right there and he did a few things a good sushi chef would never do.

The wait staff was better but again I have to ask for chopsticks and a napkin when I sit down. The place was dead also so you think that they would drive you nuts with service.

Mike the owner came over and went over the estimate. He already did his homework and had the Sq footage printed out through websites so he pretty much knew his estimate on the way over. My house was in need of stucco repair too. He ended up quoting me a fair estimate. I ended up going through an outside stucco repair and had Mike do my paint only. He ended up working with me to meet my budget so I hired hi, on the spot. 

My house is two stories so it took them nearly 4 days to complete but the work was very well done. Plus it comes with a 7 year warranty.

All the breads and pastries are made fresh daily. If you're a hardcore bread eater, this might be heaven for you, because they sell REAL BREAD here. When I say that, I mean they don't sell anything remotely similar to Wonder Bread. These loaves are HEAVY! Some breads can weigh 2lbs, if not, more (once I think of it, these could used as weapons...delicious, edible weapons), so you best believe they take their breads seriously.  Here are some of the breads that I've tried:

- Walnut Bread (Walnussbrot)
- Rye Meal Bread (Roggenschrot Brot)

German Bread Bakery also sells pretzels (surprised?). The pretzels aren't on the small side; they're a pretty good size and can fill you up easily. Also these aren't too salty. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lF4pEu4_55SSFEo6Q58ftQ?select=73W4X9xosg7lFr2OMIeIcQ#dDiBifinsb7TSl0iaq4upQ)

 I've also tried their Cherry Danish which tasty, but I wish they sold some of the pastries I loved eating while in Germany, like Johannisbeere Streusel.

Let's just say that I was fondling the Mac & Cheese, drooling, while looking at my wife in very suggestive ways.   She got embarassed and I just got off...  No, really.  The Mac & Cheese totally rocks.   The richness of the cheese is cut with the acidity of the truffle oil, and the result is a masterpiece.  Bravo!

The kobe steak was pretty good, though not great.   The scallops, though, were absolutely tender and beautifully prepared.    The mashed potatoes, too, were beautifully prepared.    The spinach souffle, while nicely presented, didn't leave a lasting memory.   Still, it tasted good enough that it deserves a honorable mention.

Based on the savory deliciousness of the Lalibela Exclusive -- a party platter consisting of [doro wat, kye sega wat, alicha sega wat, misir wat, gomen, yebere sega tibs, fosolia, yebeg alicha sega wat, tikil gomen and yekik alicha served with ayeb and selata] uhm, food n stuff that you use to envelope with a sourdough-like flatbread made of teff flour, I will gladly hand over the coveted five-star rating.

The platter had various meats -- beef, chicken, and lamb -- as well as lentils, beans, greens and herbs.  The vegans (level 4 - heh.) were able to share the meal along with the carnis without a complaint.  Between 6 of us we took down 1.5 platters.

My Husband loves Greek food, so it doesn't take much convincing to get him to take me to dinner here. We traditionally get the gyro plate, which comes with sliced gyro meat, pita bread and your choice of french fries or rice pilaf. I usually get the rice because it's a healthier option and it's very well made.

The restaurant is small and gets crowded. There is no table service - you order at the counter and they will bring your food to you when it's ready. The gyro plate is just $11.95, which is a much better value than many of the other local Greek places we've been to, and in my opinion this food is better.

Don't get me wrong: I like my anime.  I grew up on the staples of Akira, Fist of the North Star, Vampire Hunter D and a good ol' fashioned Studio Ghibli film or five.  This place really took me to that nerdtastic time in my life.

The set-up is great: Bright, cheery, with upbeat J-Pop playing as anime dressed girls greet you in Japanese.  The art is everywhere, but is very nice and classy (I do wish they had some of the old-school classics, but what they had was fun).  On TV, some Pokemon episode was playing.  When we walked in, we were the only ones there.  About halfway through our meal, the place became packed.  Talk about good timing.

The food, however, was just right for the outing.  Their gyoza is pretty darn tasty, as are their HUGE bowls of ramen.  Everything was hot and flavorful.  Even their boba teas were excellent and sweet.

Service was very nice.  The girls checked by often, but not enough to become overbearing.  They were always on top of things, and super friendly.  I appreciate the effort they put into their costumes.  It's not as crazy as some theme restaurants that I've been, but it still makes it point that the name of their game is anime.  Even their little business cards are styled after one of those trading card games, which I found charming.  It's the appreciation to details (and the tasty food) that made this experience memorable.

So memorable, in fact, that it ensures that I'll be going to this place again, and soon.  It's a neat, clever idea, and I'm glad that someone obviously has fun with the business that they run.",2011-11-02 22:43:18

My son ordered a burger piled high with crispy onions, and he enjoyed it.  

The server recommended a wedge salad, which I did not like.  To make it unique, the chef added a balsamic dressing to it.  The blue cheese and balsamic were not a happy pairing. 

The brown bread Outback is known for was okay, but I prefer the slightly sweet brown bread from Cheesecake Factory.  The blooming onion, which we thought we liked so much in the past, has lost its luster.  Too much for two people and neither of us liked the dipping sauce.

It's even a little difficult to get a reservation. At first, they told us they were booked solid. The day before, they called us back and advised that they will get us in, as previously requested. 

This place was pretty fancy. At least on this night, everyone was dressed in their best. The service was formal as well, from the moment I arrived I noticed that. I prefer somewhere more down to earth and less formal, but it definitely made for a special night. One thing that I don't particularly care for is how close the tables are to each other. So close, you could hear and smell everything from the party next to you (I know this because someone ordered a dish with truffles and it smelled divine).

I ordered the scallops, served with roasted potatoes and escarole. Let me just say, when I smelled the aroma from my neighbors dish, I wished I had ordered that. Don't get me wrong, best scallops award. That's where my happiness ended. The potatoes were bland, literally no flavor at all. I didn't even taste salt, butter or garlic, nada. And the escarole was difficult to eat. Not worth the calories and too much lemon (something I thought I would never say). Next time, I will order pasta.

UjEMz8DE8M4XqkwvCCZM1A,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,ypfFfR3-PbtoslIhohNstw,2,8,4,3,"If you advertise AYCE Korean BBQ, you should have the general decency to bring out more than one order of Galbi at a time for a party of six. We would order ""2 Galbi and 1 Brisket"" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Brisket. We would then order ""2 Galbi and 1 Ribeye"" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Ribeye. The game became predictable, and frustrating. Repeat 6 or 7 times and you begin to think that there's a big sign in the back (in Korean) that says ""Only one order of our precious Galbi per table per half hour or you're fired!"" At lease that's how it felt. To top it off, there is a warning on the bottom of the menu that threatens a $25 penalty if more than a 1/2 lb of meat is left on your table. Seeing this warning was beyond ridiculous and ironic, as at no point was more than a 1/2 lb of meat served to us at any given time.

The service was typical LA / NYC, which means it was pretty much terrible and the waitresses will actually talk shit about you (in Korean) under their breaths. I saw & heard this several times, especially when we tried to manipulate the temperature of our grill. We had to get the attention of the manager (might have been the owner's wife?) to prod our waitress into filling our 6 empty beverage glasses and our empty banchan dishes. At one point we found a sweet spot by ordering with what appeared to be a servers' assistant: he brought us the 2 Galbi and 1 Whatever that we ordered a few times in a row and we felt like we hit the jackpot - sounds sad, doesn't it? In the end we ordered about 9 plates of assorted meats for an average of 3 servings per person at our table, or about 12 oz. per person. Grill off the fat and that's about 8 oz. of $5/lb. short rib plus some random banchan and soup for $25. Not a very good value, not to mention it took 3 hours to pry that much from them. This place makes Sura BBQ Buffet look like an oasis.

Quality of food and Woonam Jung retrospective: Almost exactly one year ago, this place opened with a full-price a la carte menu. The $28 single servings of Galbi were some of the most expensive in town, but absolutely the most tender, delicious Korean marinated short rib I've ever tasted. Worth every penny. This legendary Galbi DOES NOT exist anymore at Woonam Jung. Total bait and switch. Don't even think you're getting the same quality with the new (and stingy) AYCE plan. To make matters worse, the banchan they serve is below average, which is surprising because you'd think that it should be at least better than the stuff available at the Greenland Korean Market next door. I can't imagine that the owners of this restaurant actually eat the same grade food as their AYCE customers.

You guys are being cheapos: The vent hoods weren't turned up to an acceptable level, keeping our friends against the wall in a wall of smoke the entire meal. And, a table for 6 at a truly LA-style KBBQ should have a larger grill than the little circle ones at Woonam Jung. OK enough. 2 stars and I am out for good.",2013-02-01 07:24:41

You have your anchor stores like Sears and Macy's, as well as a bunch of popular stores like Lush, B&BW, Victoria's Secret, etc. I also enjoy the Oil&Vinegar store because it's different and neat. They have a very nice food court area with a variety of food & dessert items, and plentiful comfortable seating.

My biggest peeves are:

1) with the parking, which is always a process because it's such a busy area with a lot of shoppers so more than likely I have to walk a bit to get to the entrance/store/restaurant I need to go.

2) with the bathrooms. I went on a Saturday at 1pm, arguably one of their busy days, but I still think that's a bit early in the day for the bathroom to be almost unusable.  I went to the one in the food court, and there were toilets with questionable things inside and on the seat, toilet paper pieces all over the floor, minimal toilet paper to use, and a wet floor near the sinks.  It was honestly comparable to a bathroom during midday at a theme park - had I been able to hold it I wouldn't have went in there.   This has been several times I have seen it like this, but this most recent time (last weekend) was the worst. They might consider hiring more cleaning staff or focus them more on the restrooms on the weekends because it's a shame such a nice mall has gross bathrooms.

All in all it beats a lot of other malls because its stores are always changing and very trendy. There's also a ton of places to eat nearby, a movie theatre, and several strip malls nearby for even more shopping. Definitely one of the biggest draws to the South Hills.

I've been skeptical about trying here because of how empty the plaza it's in always is. Not gonna lie, with the beat up sign and empty parking lot, it makes you wonder how good it really is. I saw on yelp that it had great reviews though and trying to find real korean food in henderson is practically nonexistent. I was craving yukgaejang like crazy so I gave in and I'm sure glad I did.
My husband and I ordered yukgaejang (spicy beef and veggie soup), bindaeduk (korean pancake) and of course their famous meat jun. It all came out to $30 and they give you really good banchan with everything. I read on a previous review that the portions were small. Maybe when you eat there it might be, idk, but ordering for take out the portions were definitely no where near small. We didn't even finish everything besides the meat jun (which my husband devoured). They give you a lot of rice with your orders. Also, I'm pretty sure they gave us about 3 large slices of the pancake but I can't be certain because we ate them so quickly and had about one slice left. The yukgaejang was perfectly spicy and still really hot by the time I got home. Their banchans (side dishes) were spot on as well.

We enter the casino and it is definitely a local's place. It was divey, which most locals places are. The first machine we go to, we are unable to get it to accept our money. We play a different machine, then try to cash out and the ticket gets stuck inside. We turn on the service light and wait, and wait, and wait. After about 10 minutes with no one coming, I go to look for someone. I approach a worker who was emptying the trash, and asked her if there was a slot tech available. She stares off into the distance and says nothing. After a long awkward moment of silence I just leave and start looking elsewhere. I finally find a slot tech and he removes our ticket. We start to walk through the casino, and we see a myriad of trash cans lined up on the floor. They were catching water leaking from the ceiling! I picked a machine to play, then decided not to when water starts to drip onto my head.
Considering it was raining inside we decided to leave so we go to the cash out machine. The machine paid us out in small bills, and it spit them all over the floor! The tray must've been missing on the front of the machine. So we crawled around on the floor picking up multiple bills and laughing all the while at the crazy silliness of this place.",2016-04-13 17:46:34

Small plates unique, flavorful, and satisfying; we tried beef tartare, squid, chicken legs, and shrimp plates. Not one dish disappointed. Our one regret is that we did not pace the ordering as the dishes came out all at once and stymied an effort for a relaxing slow meal. Our 2nd regret was eating the complimentary cheddar puffs. Although the puffs were very good, they were also filling and nipped our appetites. The beef tartare was a true highlight with flash fried seaweed, capers, taro chips, and a quail egg. 

Service was very friendly, attentive, and down to earth.

I arrived at 12:50 pm and no one was there to seat me and no one approached until the telephone started ringing and a man rushed up to answer it and take a pizza order, all while I stood there unacknowledged.

The server forgot to bring my companion's water and I had to ask for silverware and a napkin.  My companion asked for hot pepper for her pizza but it was never delivered.

We came by around 7:45 on Saturday for dinner before catching a movie. There were several groups ahead of us, so it was a 25 minute wait. We weren't pressed, so we waited. I ordered a bubble tea while waiting. Keep in mind they ask for cash or debit for these small purchases. You get boba and two other toppings included in the price.

We entertained ourselves by grabbing a menu and checking what we want. A good way to expedite the process. Also, note that it can get crowded and if it's a rainy night like when we went, the space can be tight.

We were seated and were set to go. Seaweed with garlic to share, dan dan noodles (thin) for hubs, wonton noodle soup (wide) for me. The seaweed with garlic comes and we love the flavor. The balance of sesame oil and garlic was perfect. Our noodles arrived halfway ino the seaweed. I let mine cool off and continue with a couple more bites of seaweed. 

Now to the noodles. The wonton noodle soup was a huge disappointment. I'm a serious connoisseur of this of wonton noodle soup, it's a go to staple in my life. Here the broth was bland, very watery, the meat wasn't sitting in long enough for the stock to be flavorful. The noodles were too doughy. It wasn't well represented. The wontons did save it, which leads me to think stay with the dumplings. 

The dan dan noodles were not authentic. A peanut flavor was added so the spice wasn't there. It definitely was not what we expected.

The wait is interminable and in the meantime with the long line adding up, the ""cutters"" move in slow motion and chit-chat like they have all the time in the world. Can they move any slower???

Then after you get your item cut to your specification, you have to stand in YET ANOTHER LINE at the front of the store to pay for your item. Once again, the cashiers move like thickened molasses.

So what am I saying here? I'm saying that the service here is very, very terrible and sluggish. When you come here, be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting in long, slowly-moving lines.

The food was great, though. The trio of salsas were well worth it. You get red salsa and chips complimentary. But add the $5 trio of salsas and you get habanero salsa and two green salsas. All were tasty. I opted for the pulled chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. They were yummy. Not anywhere near the best I've ever had, but they got the job done. And bonus, the sangria was tasty too.

Today, I found out I was wrong.  There's one in freaking Mekong Plaza!  To think I've frequented Mekong sooo many times in the past and just glossed over the fact that they had an awesome dim sum restaurant.  We went on a weekday at around 11 and it was pretty empty so it wasn't too surprising that only three of the carts were out.  We had our drinks orders attended to pretty much the second we sat down but the carts took a little bit to make their way over to us.

Comparing Mekong Palace to the other three (Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, and C-Fu), their steamed cart was good, loved their siew mai, they didn't have har gow when they came by (frownie), the BBQ pork buns were filled with pork and gravy and were also light and fluffy - I'd eat the entire plate myself, don't judge me.  The desserts were a little cold but still good - the custard in their custard bun is a little more liquified than others that I've had, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and their egg tarts were eggy with the right amount of sweetness.

Honestly, since I havent stopped by Great Wall or Phoenix Palace in a while, I don't know how I'd rank Mekong Palace against them (sorry C-Fu, you no longer make the list), but you know what, I think this calls for some research, ie. I might just have to swing by to get more dim sum this weekend!",2015-11-07 02:57:22

I ordered the half chicken which was overpriced $22  I mean at least give me the whole chicken for 22 bucks. it was more like a quarter chicken and
It was actually very dry I would probably give it 1-2 Stars my friend had the garden burger says was not that good. Vegetarian chili is basically minestrone soup with some extra seasoning so they shouldn't call it that just collect soup

The slot machines at the bar are $1 minimum.  The reason I like this bar is the female bartenders and the female cocktail waitress eye candy.  Another reason is the good selection of bourbons and whiskeys, and sure Scotch too.  They have Breaking & Entering bourbon which you won't find many places west of the Mississippi.  1842 Tavern at MGM has an even better bourbon and Scotch menu.  That's the real big hidden treasure for Vegas if you're a bourbon or Scotch fan.  There are TV's all around the place, so you can watch your favorite big sport games.  They were kind enough to play a Nevada footbal game which is a rare treat coming from Reno.  Their shortcoming is the limited beer menu.  For such a high-end bar, you'd think they can be a little bit more original than corporate swill and light beers.  How about a Sam Adams or Sierra NV at least, at least.  But it doesn't really matter in the final analysis, because you're only really here for the hot bartenders.  Vegas I've been told is such a union town it's hard to find young, attractive female bartenders.  You mostly get 50-year-old crusty dudes who mostly do not appreciate the new craft cocktail trend.

Whiskey or beer, whiskey or beer.  What a dilemma.  I finally settled on a ""Kentucky Mule"", which was prepared perfectly.  I had planned to get a beer after, but it was so good I had another mule instead.  Served in the appropriate copper mug, which makes it all the better.  (Side note: One time in Charleston the restaurant I was at tried to upcharge for the mug.  It seemed silly and I didn't do it, so I got to drink a Mule out of a regular glass.  It was still OK, but since the mug makes it that much more special, I was a little frustrated by the experience). Pleasantly and more appropriately, there was no mention of that kind of nonsense here.  Kudos for not being ridiculous like that.

This Queens Feast week deal was hard to pass up, they made practically their entire menu available.  It was very difficult to choose, but since the opportunity seems to come along less and less, I went for Chef Adam's Rotisserie Feature (Prime Rib).  It was everything I hoped it could be, and done just right.  I opted for the ""pee wee"" potatoes as well, although they did offer any side from the menu, not just this suggested pairing.  I went for dry rubbed chicken wings for a starter, and with five at our table everyone else got something different, so we tried most of the the starters available.  We all agreed the wings were the clear winner (although it was all delicious).

The manager offered a refund if we wanted to leave but my family wanted to watch the movie, especially after waiting 1.5 hours for our show time. In lieu she offered us vouchers to see another movie on another date and assured me this was not a regular occurrence.
She handled the situation well and we will give them another chance and hope for a cleaner environment.

Next ran into a stall that was able to find a hedge trimmer and a branch cutter. Both rusted but still pretty sturdy. He gave me a slashed down price for two of them at 11 dollars. What a bargain. Felt like I hit the jackpot.

Soft opening was September 1st. They are still filling the space out with seating areas and tables.

If you've ever been to the original, you know what to expect: really good tea and freshly-made add-ons. I'm pretty simple, so I usually get the namesake milk tea and add honey boba and lychee jelly. For something a little less sweet, I really like the mango/black and peach/black iced teas.

Staff was top notch. Quick to fill drinks and keep your complimentary chip basket filled. The menu seemed a little weak. Mostly just your basic Mexican fare and nothing screamed out ""I'M SPECIAL TRY ME!""

My GF tried the Steak Fajitas and was upset that they had poured a tomato/basil sauce over everything. This is a Mexican restaurant not an Italian one so I can understand her confusion and disappointment. 

Management came over right away when they saw her frown after tasting the sauce and offered to remake the dish for her. She declined, scraped off the sauce and dove right in. Turned out the sauce is fairly new on the fajitas and many people don't like it. (Why is it still being served that way would be a good question for the kitchen manager)

I had the seafood enchiladas. They seemed a bit off visually and even a little disappointing that they were using micro/extra small shrimp. After a few sample bites to reassure my tastebuds I liked the dish I ended up cleaning my plate.

They don't make the guacamole at your table but from the taste and chunks found in your order it does appear they are making it fresh in the kitchen it wasnt the best in Vegas but I'd give it top five for Guacamole. My only complaint on the Guacamole was that I had to share it with my table.

My go-to is the ""house fave"" Garlic sauce.  The employee was really helpful and offered to let me try all of them before I decided. Thank you!! 

Customize your bowl or wrap. The DIY process is easy as 123. Just read and follow the directions people. You cant go wrong. All the veggies and sauces complement each other.  TIP: the more colorful, the more delicious, not only visually appealing but tastier too.

Love also how they remodeled the space with a more fresh and modern look. The projection screen is pretty cool touch.

My wife and I went to Table 51 and I ordered the house specialty... the Braised Beef. The braised beef is a slow-cooked good portion of meat served on the bone in a deep plate with grelot potatoes and carrots in a delicious sauce. The braised beef was simply out of this world and something I have never tasted previously. I truly recommend trying it out yourself.

For dessert my wife ordered the fried Oreos. I already had my fill with the excellent braised beef but curiosity got the better of me and I tried a few.... it was delicious and fought my wife to get my due share! LOL!

As far as decor goes, if you enjoy retro-styled 60s cafeteria-like ambiance then this is the place for you. I don't recommend this place for romance as it was really noisy and lacked intimacy. The seating isn't particularly comfortable.

We stood at the bar while waiting for a table, the female bartender didn't even acknowledge us. We were then seated, at my least favorite area, the pass. So as we watched servers go back and forth with food, not once did anyone acknowledge us again. For a good 10 minutes. Finally we place a cocktail order, I get a Paloma and my friend a margarita. I take one sip of my drink and all I taste is Squirt. Who puts Squirt in a Paloma? I didn't even know they stilll had that soda around. So then we order a couple items. The elote was dry and the queso fundido wasn't as good as the first time I had it.

I didn't realize the guacamole burger didn't come with cheese, so next time I'll add pepper jack for an extra kick.

And thinking of their fries and onion rings is enough to make me salivate. Their rings are coated with a tempura batter and fried till crispy.  Their fries are thin and very crispy as well.  While ketchup is a mainstay, I prefer to dip my fries and rings in their homemade chipotle ranch.  Yum!

Southern Charm: Bourbon, Vodka & Black Tea muddled with Fresh Mint & Lemon. Finished with Peach Bitters. I love a good tea boozy drink. Tea's are my thing and this one was no joke. YUMMY. I think that the fresh mint and lemon were a great addition to the drink. I would order this one again, and again, and...again. 

Appetizers:
Honey Habanero Wings: A great combination of sweet & heat. Buffalo Sauce & Bourbon BBQ available for those more traditionally minded. These were fried to perfection. I would have liked a little more sauce on them but now I know to ask for extra for next time. They were hot, so do not be fooled. I hate when some places say habanero wings and they taste like cayenne, these ones are hot so just watch out. 

Pommes Frites: Cut Fresh by Hand All Day, Every Day. Truffled Gorgonzola. A must have addition to any visit to Burgatory. Do not skip, do not pass, do not think eh, not today. Just order them and be done with it. They are great and you will be messing up  your entire experience here if you do not order them!!

Burgers:
Piggy Butter & Jelly: Cajun Dusted Ground Beef & Ground Bacon Burger with White American Cheese, Candied Bacon, Bread & Butter Pickles, Peanut Butter & Habanero Jelly. As disgusting as this sounds this was probably my favorite burger on the menu. It was so weird it was good. I loved how the taste really melded together to make something wonderful. Try it out, even if you order it for the table and everyone takes a bite. Just try it out and go from there. You will not be disappointed. And if you are at least you can say you got to try out a burger that has pb and j on it!

Elk Gone Wild: Diablo Dusted Grass Fed Elk Burger, Smoked Gouda, Caramelized Onion Marmalade & Bacon Jam with Roasted Tomato Vinaigrette tossed Arugula. This burger is spicy! The diablo dust is not a joking matter. The only thing I can say is that while this burger was good, elk is super dry because it is so lean. I was not thrilled with the taste of it and thought they could have cut it with something else to bring a little moisture in. I would probably not order this again. While good, it wasn't so great that it is on my must try again list. 

I like it here and you should too! This is a great place to grab drinks or a quick meal before a movie or to go on a nice date. I would highly recommend coming during happy hour and taking advantage of all the good deals. Maybe I will see you here!",2017-02-22 14:08:04

It doesn't make pretentious claims of being the best, nor does it price itself as if it were. Yet there is more substance than I would have expected from a tourist-friendly preposition like this one.

The $15 lunch table d'hôte must be one of the best value in town Mon-Sat. It's not a typo. I've been happy enough with the 7oz sirloin steak that I came back for it. It's a thick and lean cut, with just enough seasoning, and cooked to a perfect medium-rare like I ordered. Soup/salad and dessert are included, so the portion size is more than adequate for lunch.

I was pleased with the buffet brunch on Sunday as well. It was much more than a carb fest - meats of all kinds were available (roast pork and beef, ribs, smoked salmon, and mussels, just to name a few) in addition to omelettes prepared-to-order, soft waffles and berries. There were many sweets to choose from as well (crème brulée, cakes, etc.) though they were more filling than delightful. The ribs were interesting: not your traditional fall-off-the-bone BBQ-sauce ribs - those ones had the texture and taste of their steak.

I feel there is genuine attempt by Management to offer good service. As well, the cooking appears to be consistent. No hesitation in recommending this place to friends.",2015-07-05 19:41:19

THE WONDERFUL:

- Choice. Seriously. This place has everything. You can come here for breakfast. You can come here for brunch. You can come here for lunch. You can come here for dinner. You can come here for drinks, finger food, as part of a night on the town. The menu is HUGE. It has everything from Pad Thai, to chicken curry, to traditional sandwiches, to pasta, to burgers, to French toast, to poutine and quite literally everything in between. Oh, and there's a wide range of teas, coffees, juices, beverages, and cocktails.

- The taste! Everything I've tried here (and I've tried a lot - most of the above listed dishes and drinks, in fact) has tasted great. Full of flavour, everything in balance, mostly mouth-watering. (Why am I writing this review just before lunch? Mhmm....)

- Value. This place is as cheap as you'd get in Toronto. I discovered it the first morning I arrived in the city on my visa, and ate there religiously for my first few weeks while searching for a job and an apartment. I would have starved if it weren't for this place! Even when I got a job and moved out to the east end, I still continued to return, as the portion sizes are GINORMOUS, and will keep you full all day. Not only are their base prices well below the city's average, additional deals are offered on some parts of the menu, e.g.: soup and sandwich for 6.75 (or something), add on coffee to breakfast for just 1.75, etc, etc.

- Layout.  It manages to be cosy, yet also inviting to large groups, with most tables offering long benches as seating. Décor is mostly Asian, with a trendy, modern twist. There's an outdoor patio for those summer scorchers.

If choice, taste, value and layout are all you value in a restaurant, then stop reading and consider this place a five-star establishment.


THE BAD:

- The service is overall, quite bad. Slow and unfriendly. I had the experience of our waiter not believing we were tipping enough, so he just took our money and kept the residual change without even asking if we wanted any money back. This was after this particular server began to know my boyfriend and I as regulars, so his actions made us feel as though we were stingy and not tipping enough (even though we were leaving moderate tips for the service encountered).

THE HORRIFYING:

- I can cope (easily) with the poor service, but I cannot accept poor hygiene standards. Unfortunately, I read a recent report stating that the Red Room failed a hygiene and safety inspection - one minor infraction, four significant infractions. I can turn a blind eye to many things, but not to food safety and hygiene standards. For this reason alone, I will not return to the Red Room. What a shame.",2014-05-28 16:59:43

After eating at Veggie House I think I prefer vegetarian Chinese over regular Chinese. I've been here 3 times and it's been more consistent than I've ever experienced at another Chinese restaurant. 
Veggie House is on the second floor of what I think is the #3 popping plaza of China Town. Park near the supermarket, it's almost directly over it. Parking in this lot isn't too bad compared to the other two popping plazas. 
They have a top ordered picture menu (not Chef Kenny's specialties on the main menu) and those have been the best things I've had. 
1. Orange chicken (on top ordered menu): Has a spicy chili mark, but it isn't spicy at all. The ""chicken"" is soft and outside crunchy. The ratio of crunch to ""meat"" was perfect. Bye bye Panda Express, this was on another level. 
2. Kung Pao chicken (also on top ordered): Perfect ratio/consistency of ""chicken"" cashew red/green pepper. Not spicy, but watch the chilis inside!
3. Honey walnut shrimp: The ""shrimp"" was a little too gooey for me and turned me off from the dish. I guess it's not on the most ordered for a reason. 
4. Spicy beef: Weird texture

We sampled this truck's fare when they were parked at Coffee Buddha in the North Hills. Luckily, we didn't have to endure a long wait in line like other reviewers have mentioned here, because we got to the truck pretty much right when it opened (cuz I'm kinda Type A like that).

Rather than using my usual elaborate hyperbole to describe how good the food was, I'll keep it simple and just say: the tacos were very tasty. I tried the grilled chicken taco and the thai chili chicken taco. The grilled chicken taco was basic but executed very well. Perfectly-seasoned, juicy meat, fresh pico, and cheese were combined on a double layer taco shell and it was absolutely delicious (and special props for the double shell -- gotta make sure the bed for the fillings is properly reinforced!)  The thai chicken taco was also yummy, filled with seasoned chicken and topped with a sweet thai chili slaw. Again, fairly simple, but done very well.

The tacos were $4 each, which I thought was a bit steep, so I took off one star for that. I would think that a food truck would have low overhead costs, so I would expect prices to be more in the $2-3 range. But what do I know?",2014-11-15 15:48:20

The salon itself is small, very cute and girly, with updated equipment and décor. There are 3 stylist who work here and own the space. When you come in, you check in with your hair stylist and show them your ""inspiration hair"" photo. You sign a contract and go over pricing so there are no surprises when you finish and go to pay. In total, it took about 3.5 hours to complete my hair, mostly because she didn't use any heat or foils, she used saran wrap and good old time to process. I appreciated this so much as it causes less damage to the hair. The olaplex is totally worth the extra price, it makes your hair so soft, shiny, and healthy looking. 

I was watching the other stylists in the salon, and they were able to lift their clients hair from dark brown to blonde in one session which amazed me! Everyone was very friendly and willing to help each other if someone was busy or if the client finished processing early. 

Shelby wasn't juggling clients, I was her only client so I didn't run into any of the issues some of the other reviews had. I loved my experience and I absolutely loved my how my hair turned out!

The tofu was lightly fried accompanied by a tiny cucumber salad and sweet sauce. Loved it especially when I augmented it with chili oil to suit my taste. 
The shaken beef was served on a sizzling platter with lightly cooked green beans and onions with a few bell peppers thrown in. Sublime!

The first visit I was satisfied with the food, but the service sucked badly. I know the place is owned by an immigrant family, and service in some asian(also Europe) countries is not expected to be at the level of the US. But with that said, I have traveled in the Philippines, Korea, Thailand, UK, mainland Europe, Japan, etc., and never experienced service this pathetic. When you get the waiter to your table, order everything because you aint seeing him again until you get the bill. I should mention, both times I had to go to the counter to ask for the bill despite ringing the bell on the table several times.

The second visit was the clincher. My wife ordered the bbq, where they bring the grill to the table and you cook it yourself. One of the staff had the nerve to come over and turn off the grill because the party behind us complained. Firstly, don't have the bbq if your ventilation sucks. Second, don't expect that passive display of disrespect to dissuade a guy like me... I cranked it back up and cooked that shit well done.

2. The service was pretty slow. A lot of people actually ended up leaving their tables and walking out because it was taking so long. I'm not an asshole so I stuck it out but I think it's relevant to mention in any review. So if you are in a rush, maybe go somewhere else.
3. I never thought I would complain about my sushi being TOO big, but my sweet potato roll was cut into such large pieces it was very hard to enjoy. When you're about to choke on potato it's hard to relish the flavor of the food.  

Like I said though, the food really was enjoyable but it just didn't seem like my experience earned more than 3/5.",2015-02-04 16:29:19

Black bean sauce typically makes a dish savory but this one lacked flavor.  I am guessing from previous visits that they excel more in the Seafood department.

Or wooden benches on one side of a table and plush chairs on the other. Everything seemed a little dark and heavy with lots of reds.

Our waitress was attentive and quick. I ordered a couple of beers from the beer list, unfortunately they were out of both of them. Our waitress recommended a substitution. It was fine, but not Irish.

For lunch I tried the poutine. It came with thick cut fries, cheese curds, and Shepherd's Pie filling. The fries were as-described - very thick cut. There were a lot of them and definitely tasted of potato. They really could have used more salt, pepper, or the Shepherd's Pie filling to give them some flavor. The cheese curds were a little jarring. I expected them to be warm and molten but they were cold bites surrounded by lots of potatoes. The Shepherd's Pie filling was delicious. Chunks of tasty root vegetables and a thick warm sauce. I really wish there had been more of this to truly cover all of those thick-cut fries.

I also feel like there is a push to get you to schedule a follow up appointment, or to come in for a ""wellness"" exam.

When you see this sticker on a business's window, it is usually quite apparent why people love them so much. This place.....I don't really know what's to love so much.
I, too, purchased the Groupon that was $99 for 6 laser hair removal treatments in 2 areas. When I called to schedule my first appointment, the receptionist was pretty nice to me, and she was able to get me in within the next week.
I have done 5 out of the 6 treatments so far, and I am very pleased with the results. They advertise their laser as ""painless."" Well, it's definitely NOT painless, but as the treatments go on, the pain decreases with each one, and it's really not that bad. I would recommend laser hair removal to anyone that I know. 
I have had 3 or 4 different technicians do the treatments on me, since I never requested a particular person, and they have all been female, and pretty friendly, although no nonsense about getting you in and out. Each treatment takes about 10 minutes.
However, like other Yelpers, I think that the front-desk staff needs to be re-trained in customer service. I am treated like I am a huge pain in their asses when I am always on-time and polite. I don't know if they only treat people who bought the Groupon this way, or all of their customers, but all of the women at the front desk have this snarky attitude like I am inconveniencing them SOOO much.
Isn't the point of Groupon to attract new customers with a deeply discounted price and then make them happy so they keep coming back and paying full price? I understand that the Groupon that I bought is a SCREAMING deal for laser hair removal, and they are not making as much money off of me as they would be from a customer who is paying full price, but I don't feel like I need to be treated so terribly by the receptionists here. They have achieved the opposite of new business with me....I now love laser hair removal but if I ever decide to get it in another area or get a touch-up, I will be SURE to take my business somewhere else where I will feel at least a little welcomed.",2014-03-16 01:30:15

I think we are at a cross point today where there is too much emphasis on eating with are eyes over our senses. Too often do I see people glorifying every single edible thing they can get their hands on via social media. Anyhow, that is another discussion for another day.

Chiado just does it right. The ingredients are fresh, simple and cooked perfectly. Everything tastes delicious and you will leave knowing that you've had a great meal even though it may not leave a lasting impression. Their specialty is of the seafood variety and they know how to cook it well. Every fish variety is tender and juicy while there is a delicate balance of those subtle seafood flavours and added spices. I truly believe the best seafood preparations are minimalistic; seafood should taste delicate and refine. It's one of those foods where the less is more approach really holds true. I applaud these guys for staying true to their roots of classic  preparations just like how they do it overseas (during my last visit to Portugal).

It has the generic mall stores that you can find in just about every mall nowadays (AE, Abercrombie, Express, BR, JCrew, etc). It has an incredibly weird layout, so it feels like you are always doubling back to go to the stores you want.  Parking, especially on a Friday night, is a disaster.  The lot is always really full, but when you walk inside, there aren't the amount of people you would expect for how many cars are in the lots.  The selections in the stores I frequent are not as good as at the Scottsdale Fashion Square.

The two things I like about the Chandler Fashion Center: 

1. Barnes and Noble...I love there is a B&N at the mall. It's not the best B&N ever, but for a break from shopping, I appreciate it. The only negative of this B&N is that right outside of it is the little kids play area. It's a little hard to enjoy book shopping when you can hear 20 little ones screaming their heads off.

2. Carvel ice cream stand at the Food Court...I think I've died and gone to heaven!!!  I spent my first 10 years living on Long Island (NY) and grew up going to Carvel.  To me, Baskin Robbins, TCBY, and Dairy Queen all pale in comparision to Carvel.  To get a sugar rush while shopping, I can savor a cup of chocolate soft-serve with rainbow sprinkles....yummy!

I guess if you live in Chandler or around it, it's a decent place to go shopping.  But since I live almost equi-distant from both Chandler Fashion Center and the Scottsdale Fashion Square, I'd pick Scottsdale anyday.",2007-12-29 21:43:53

I even saw an employee grab a drink for a guest who was handicapped. It was heart warming to see. Everything to the counter, to the drink machine to the restrooms everything was clean.

Took 5 minutes exactly to order and get our food delivered while it was busy. That's great. We ordered the 6 piece platter with extra fries and Texas toast. Oh yeah and sauce :) food was delivered to me by a manager with a smile. Love seeing managers involved.

It was in layers of sponge cake and mouuse and there were four layers. The cake was not too sweet to my taste. I actually found a raspberry inside one layer of mouuse and I could taste the berry flavour in the mouuse. The cake blended so well with the syphon coffee. It's Bittersweet altogether.

Marché Bacchus cavernous space includes a retail wine store, a couple of interior rooms, and an enclosed patio overlooking a small lake, The set turkey dinner was $45.00 for salad, turkey, sides, and dessert.  This wouldn't be a bad deal if anything tasted good.  Nothing did.  According to my companions, the salads were tasteless, the turkey dry, and the desserts in eatable.  I ordered off the a la carte menu with a bit more fortune.  While my goat cheese tarte was cloyingly sweet with a honey dripping, my braised beef tenderloin bits were rather tasty.  The pecan pie was a tasteless tarte, rather than any piece of pie.

Marché Bacchus serves only wine and beer, and must be the only restaurant in Las Vegas that doesn't serve liquor.  There wine list is decent, but I so wanted a cocktail.   Service was quite good, and I felt bad knowing he realized we weren't enjoying our meal.

The 30 minute drive from the Four Seasons was such a wasted trip.  Marché Bacchus did not provide a memorable Thanksgiving.

Yagyu in LV is Juban in SF or Manpuku in LA, that is, where Japanese clientele gather when they crave Yakiniku. It's that simple.

And not only that.

They have tremendous menu items to choose from. Lunch at Yagyu is one of our favorite - If you haven't tried their Gyu-don (beef bowl) you should - THAT ALONE WARRANTS RETURNING VISIT.

The oysters are a tasty deal ($1 each for nice-sized Bluepoints) - the big question is if that's a loss-leader or if they will stay that cheap forever? And the live scallop is pretty delicious, too. Big fan of the Ponzu Salsa and the Pickled Peppers & Habañero oyster sauces (you get to pick from a list of 6 of them).

The waffle fries sound appealing, but don't get your nostalgic Chick-fil-A hopes up. They come out skinny-ish and slighly overfried. Chick-fil-A just announced their newest franchise location to be coming soon (to Henderson?) so the novelty of waffle fries shall soon be a novelty no more.

Got a bunch of other menu items, and was able to try:

The dolsot bi-bim-bap-style Pork Belly Kim Chi Fried Rice, which was disappointingly bland, underseasoned and mushy (the rice). I guess it would be a miracle to expect that this would be good here? If you've *never* had legit dolsot bi-bim-bap I can see how your mind might be blown by the hot stone pot, et al. But seeing as 13 of the 20 customers during my last visit were actual Asian Yelpers that I recognized (crazy!) they might have a hard time making this dish convincing.

The Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings, which were relatively good - 'relatively' being the operative word - it's pretty hard to mess up fried chicken wings. The herbs and spices in the fry meal are almost KFC-like, which isn't a bad thing. But I wouldn't know they were particularly 'Yuzu' unless you told me. At about $2.50 a wing these aren't exactly a bargain. 

The Roasted Shishito Peppers: a pretty uninspired effort. There are many better versions of this around town. The roasted cauliflower that this dish came with was one of the better things we ate this time around. More of that!

Amberjack Crudo: suggested by our waitperson. A chalky taste (and aftertaste) really made this unappealing. Disappointing and $11 for about 4-5 slices. I wish I had gotten 11 more oysters instead.

Red wine by the glass ($10-$13) will start to add up. Beer is pretty reasonably priced.

Sitting in front of the oyster cabinet is a bit hard on the eyes - the fluorescent kitchen lights shine bright. Sunglasses wouldn't be out of order.

Overall, a solid effort, but *far* from mind-blowing in terms of flavor profiles. Really cool staff (which they've got!) will help this place do well. But a few nip-tucks and adjustments to the food will ensure they will become a frequent hang of those who eat out the most - twice a day, every day of the year...",2015-05-01 07:43:39

NOT ANYMORE!!!  I went here last Thursday and tried some of the Chocolate cake.  It was nothing short of fantastic.  I was also in an absolute rush to get to a friend's ""new house"" gathering that they even sold me a bottle of champagne so I wouldn't have to stop at a gas station to grab an emergency bottle.

So that was Thursday.  Two days later and I'm walking back into Lady M Cakes again.  This time, I came for a full Cheesecake and a slice of the Green Tea cake.  It was super expensive, but by far the best Cheesecake in Charlotte I've tasted so far.  To me, it was worth it.  The entire Cheesecake was HUGE and can feed a ton of people, which was what I needed for a friend gathering later that night.

Food/Drinks - 4/5 (considering price & portion)
True, the El Furniture franchise is known for their cheap foods and pricey drinks. That being said, I would have expected their food to be at least comparable to their competitors. We ordered two of their brunch specials - the Breaky Burrito, and the Chorizo Hash. While both were decent in all fairness, and nothing was wrong with them per se, they were also a little underwhelming for food that was served after 40 minutes of wait. 

The drinks were a Hit or Miss. While the Caesar was delicious, the Brass Monkey (cocktail of beer and OJ,) was flat, watered down, and overall unimpressive. As mentioned before, the El Furniture franchise is known for their pricey drinks making up for the cheap foods. However, if the drinks are to command a certain price, they should be held to a certain standard. 

Service - 2/5 
Our experience with the service was not the best. Perhaps because the Service Charge was already included in by default, we found the waitress to be quite inattentive, as the wait time for each request was too long for us to appreciate. Interestingly, the staff who brought us the food (which was not our waitress,) was more attentive and willing to help. He was able to provide us more service and information in a timely manner than our own waitress.

We received BOGO with Players ""Code"" card @ local id, $40 for 2.
I believe can also get BOGO if a Hotel Guest?

You be the judge whether this buffet is worth the regular price of $40?

It's a very small buffet, yet Not crowded at all for a Friday night. Very few people there.

I would suggest a walk through before paying because the selections are very limited & may not be to your liking?

Because we were within 1 hour of closing, the food items were not refreshed/maintained. 

Funny, but the Rice with chicken layered on top was refilled/refreshed about 9pm.
But was mostly without (only a few pieces) chicken from the time we got there. 
Rather than mix the chicken in, they lay the pieces of chicken on top. 
So people pick the chicken off the top with little rice & leave a pile of rice.

No Salad Bar to speak of.
Skinny Crab Legs, kind of not worth the effort? Pictures of Crab Legs look bigger/better than in person.

After attempting to drive around downtown in Calgary rushhour traffic, I think you might agree with me that Transit may just be your best option to avoid frustration.  
The transit is pretty good in this city - most routes head downtown where everyone works anyway, they're on time, and there's even transit lanes to help the bus go faster than any car could anyways.  
The C-Train is a great option to move masses of people from the 'burbs to the bright lights of downtown, and with multiple Park & Ride stations where you can park for free, it's a great way to get from Point A to Point B.
The only issue that I have is the late night cutoff time.  For some dumb reason, there is no transit available after 1:30am.

I normally would let something like this go but it really bugged me. I drove up and needed a oil change and smog. I spoke to a gentleman in glasses and told him this information. I asked for the usual oil change that included the car wash. He said okay and showed me inside. I need to mention i have a turn to start car and always leave my key near the speedometer. After sitting down and grabbing a drink I was asked about my key, i explained it was in the dash and they just needed to turn to start. He then questioned, Are you sure? YES, I AM. Ugh, whatever it's cool. I then was brought over by another gentleman with glasses to talk about all the things I need and such, they found a leak which was helpful and he said he would be done shortly, so i asked him about the smog. He said and i quote, ""Oh, I wish you would have told me that first."" You got to be kidding. I did tell the guy. Alright its cool. I told him its gonna get done right... Well, the manager, i assume, cashed my out around $40 for the oil change and i asked if it included the smog to which he replied, ""You need a smog?"". You can understand my frustration and the fact I told him to forget it and give me my key. Also I don't believe they filled the air in my tires, they are all still low. Get it together people. Just another quickie lube that doesn't care about customer service.

I should be called a boba princess for being so addicted to boba but I will stop here. Never knew Jackie Bee Boba Express opened until my friend told me about it. Conveniently located across from CSN Charleston Campus, Jackie Bee Boba Express is a great hangout spot for college students. 

ATMOSPHERE
Spacious, modern, clean and most of the times quiet. Jackie Bee is located next to PVP Zone (Internet cafe), there are a lot of video game players going in and out of the stores. Even though the store can get loud at times, there are many outlets to charge your laptop while doing your homework and they even have a free wifi (password: videogame). 

SERVICE
Great service! Love that servers/cashiers are chill and friendly. They are willing to answer any questions.

DRINK
If you are a college student, show your student ID for 20% off! With the student discount, I get my boba drink for around $3-$4. On my first visit, I got an Oolong tea with boba. I was disappointed with the taste/quality. I have gotten an Oolong tea from KFT, it did not have any strong tea taste like KFT but just a very subtle/plain taste, almost like a flavored water. 

On my second visit, I ordered a Jasmine milk tea with boba (I get this everywhere I go). Jasmine milk tea here taste just like the one from QQ boba. It is very light on milk and doesn't have that overpowering sweetness. Even though I like my Jasmine milk tea floral, I really liked this version of Jasmine milk tea. I would say the only difference between here and QQ boba is that Jasmine milk tea here taste like there is soy milk in it. I no longer have to drive an hour to Henderson for Jasmine milk tea... :)

In conclusion, their drinks are good because none of the drinks have any artificial/overpowering sweetness. Subtle and just the right amount of sweetness. I do like the texture of boba here, just wondering why they would call it ""Honey Boba"" when it doesn't even taste like honey.

If you don't like boba, they also have many other options for toppings. I have not tried any of their food yet but my friend said their onion rings and popcorn chicken are really good. I will have to try those and update my review~",2015-03-05 05:14:38

Except for that, we liked the menu, it was nice and elaborate. The place itself was clean and inviting, prices low, portions ok - a bit on the smallish side.

The servers... Another case of super friendly folks completely wonderful to have around - yet forgetting to do their job.

The experience so horrible that we had not returned because of that. Management fixed the situation but we were still gun shy. So, long story short my husband and I stayed at the Camelback Inn on St. Patrick's Day weekend, knowing when we made the hotel arrangements we did not want to be driving on St. Patrick's Day and opted to give BLT another try. I made the reservation on Open Table, noting to restaurant it was a 27th wedding anniversary.

Dinner reservations were at 7:00 p.m., we were greeted and seated at a table outside with a beautiful view. Our waiter came over and we ordered cocktail and appetizers of 1/2 dozen Oysters and the Tuna Tartare (Avocado, Soy-Lime Dressing). As BLT tradition has it, a complimentary Chicken Pate and Popovers were served. For entree's ordered the New York Strip 14oz (medium rare) and the Loaded Baked Potato.

I will come out and say it right now, our waiter totally ruined our anniversary dining experience. He could not have been more impersonable, no introduction was made, no ""Happy Anniversary"", no personality, very short with us, almost rude like he couldn't be bothered. Meanwhile telling the table behind us he was getting transferred out of Scottsdale location and reassigned to another location (was that the reason he was so miserable?) The Appetizers were very good, the popovers excellent, the New York strip was more medium the rare and the meat tough and at $45 that's hard to swallow, and to end the dinner without an Anniversary dessert ""wishing us a Happy Anniversary.""

It was a great experience, especially with the small stadium and being so close to the action.  Great family friendly atmosphere and good fans.  I really want to see this club succeed and eventually have an MLS franchise in Phoenix!

PROS:
-Futbol, futbol, futbol!  Drogba!
-Parking is free!  Getting in was OK -- but getting out was much slower.  YMMV.  I wonder if they could add a second exit onto McClintock?
-Reasonable prices on merchandise -- $21.75 for a Rising shirt!
-Adult beverages available.
-Bathrooms were clean and not a long wait.
-Energetic bands playing for the entire game on the south side of the stadium!

CONS:
-I didn't see any recycling containers available.  There was a lot of plastic and aluminum cans that ended up in the trash.
-The sound system is terrible.  I was on the east side of the stadium and I couldn't understand a word that was said.

I brought my family here for a little Valentine's Day late afternoon lunch. When we showed up, the place was empty. Literally, we were the only people sitting in the restaurant which was a little awkward. We were sat promptly and we immediately were in awe of the enormous fish tank. This floor to ceiling is an aquarium lovers wet dream is amazing, ha! It's placed right in the middle of the restaurant and gives diners a great place to rest their eyes and thoughts during lulls in dinner conversation.

We ordered apps and drinks and so far so good. A bottle of wine for the table and I opted for Moscow Mule. It was ok, a little heavy on the ginger beer and light on the vodka. I prefer it the other way around. The apps were amazing; the Kim Chee Calamari was like crack, I would smoke it if allowed. The Kim Chee added that vinegar flavor that went great with lightly fried calamari. There fried veggies and a amazing sauce that accompanied this dish. I highly recommend ordering this dish, but be ready to share because this plate of food is huge! We also ordered the Coconut Crunchy Shrimp and these were great. A little outshined after the Kim Chee dish, but still very good. The shrimp was still juicy and not over cooked and the coconut breading was light and just a tad sweet. Yummers. 

At this point in the meal we were all talking, plates were licked clean, and starting to stack up. Just as the restaurant was just starting to get busy our soup and salads were arriving, so you'd think the server would remove the plates that were stacked up, but nope, they stayed on the table. After salads and soups were finished (BTW - Lobster Bisque was quite delicious) this new set of plates and bowls were now added to already decent pile of tableware. There were five of us, so lets do that math... 5 plates for apps + 2 bowls of soup + 2 large salad plates + 2 bread baskets + 5 bread plates +1 bottle of wine + 3 wine glasses + 2 cocktail glasses, and a partridge in a pear tree. That's about 23 items on a table, half of which were dirty and no longer being used. Now, in a normal fine dining restaurant, these items would be cleared immediately and the table would be re-dressed with silverware and napkins. This did not happen. 

The main course showed up and the food runners realized there was absolutely no space for anything on the table. They placed our food off to the side and cleared the table, this took about three minutes. This just shows the amount of stuff that had piled up. Finally, the table is cleared and the food is delivered. 

I'll mainly focus on my meal, but I did try a little bit of everyone's and it all was very good. I ordered the Stuffed Flounder: Crab-stuffed with lemon shallot butter and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. This was delicious, the flounder was perfectly cooked. The tender fish was juicy and just flaked apart when cut into with my fork. The crab was a like an amazing edible surprise, that I had forgot about it until it poured out on to the plate. This plate was not only gorgeous, but a giant seafood flavor bomb. The carb lovers side dish was the beautiful golden mashed potatoes. Buttery, creamy goodness! 

To close out the meal we tried their dessert specials... Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Chart House Souffle. These were both meh, but I'm not a sweet person. So don't take my word for it. 

Wow. I feel like I just had a brain baby with this review. Even though the service was weak, The Chart House's food is stellar and definitely worth the price.

We started with a appetizer plate that had Guacummus, Calamari, and lettuce wraps.  I love their guacummus it's full of flavor and a perfect blend of two great things.  The lettuce wraps are very good as well very unique with chicken fruit and nuts in them. 

Next course was the salads she got the mixed greens and I went with the Latin Passion which comes with Baby spinach, field green mix, jack cheese, corn, tomato, pinto bean, cilantro, green onion, crispy tortilla strip, and a tropical spicy dressing.  The salad was awesome but also filling which was going to be a problem as I haven't even got to my main course.  

So for the main courses she got the New York strip with chimichurri and grilled shrimp.  They were good and the steak was very good.  I went with the chipotle chicken which was good but lacking that chipotle flavor I was hoping for.  

Lastly we got our dessert to go because we were both just stuffed.  We got the empenada which was great a few hours later.  

We washed down our meal with Laura getting a glass of temperinillo and I had a lychee mojito and it was sooooooooo good.  

Ticoz is a great spot to chill and have a nice meal I totally recommend it they have a ton of great items on the menu and great drinks to wash them down with.",2011-02-15 18:10:23

I am a bit of a Mexican-food snob & prefer mom n pop type of Mexican joints. I was expecting OK tasting food & expensive prices since it's on The Strip. 
The prices were quite high for the amount of food you get, but I was surprised at how delicious the chimichangas & cheese quesadillas were!

The setting was very casual & VERY loud. I couldn't hear my friends from across the table. But, it has a decent view of the Las Vegas Blvd & the Water Fountain Show at Bellagio.

Overall experience: it satisfied my hunger & I had a great time with my party.

Would I eat here again? Probably not =/",2016-08-13 05:56:49

Last night- we experienced a Meh moment. We ordered burgers. When they came out- I ate a fry. Took the Bun off the burger- looked at my husband and said. ""I didn't order this."" But it was the burger with bbq and onion rings on it. It actually was my second choice so I decided to keep it.
    My husband noticed they brought him half/half fries and onion rings. He didn't order that but -whatever.
   server comes back- says sorry these weren't yours, we mixed them up. I start to say- I touched the burger-she was gone. It's very loud in Zipps- BUT When a customer is speaking to you- don't rip the food away and go. My husband said, well, you tried to tell her.
    My point was- I don't want to receive food other people have fingered.eww. And for that reason I will not eat at Zipps again. The food was ok- no complaints on taste.  The place is for sports watching and drinking anyway. Good crowd for the Stanley cup............",2014-06-13 01:31:54

I'll leave it at that. Okay - no I won't.  My group of four headed out on a Tuesday night and were met with a nearly empty Wingharts.  Throughout the course of our visit one other table arrived and a couple of other patrons here and there. It appeared that the bartender was the only server on site, but not big deal consider the extremely light crowd. However, she still managed to be less than cordial. Barely a smile. Never a ""is there anything else I can get you?"" Dramatic, but asking for ketchup and mustard seemed like a chore.  That being said, the food wasn't bad. It also wasn't amazing. The two burgers amongst our 4 were very solid, but at $10+ for just the burger - we could go to Burgatory and get more for less. The falafel patty was decent, but the lettuce wrap and $1 pineapple were so...stupid is probably the best word. I don't expect much from a lettuce wrap, but it is possible to do it well. One wilted piece of lettuce laid on the bottom and one laid on top does not a lettuce wrap make in my humble opinion. And a few cubes of canned pineapple don't do it either. Burgatory wasn't the end all be all to me until this visit...but I think it is now.",2016-02-26 21:43:36

I was surprised at how large the space was.  It was elegant and vibrant and still casual-cool-hipster.

We ordered a bunch of small plates while we waited for the paella (you have 45 minutes to kill, about 5 plates did the trick).

The vegetarian items were much better than expected.  
The fried artichokes were especially memorable.  I didn't know artichokes could be that good!

Fried Green Tomatoes were also a favourite.  Crispy and flavourful, the slices were stacked on top of each other.  Cute presentation!

The sardines were also fantastic.  I like how they include the can on the plate.

The paella was unique and great for sharing (we shared it amongst three people).  The Paella de Montaña ($30) has snails and rabbit.  The snails were ginormous and tasty morsels, the rabbit was tender and juicy.  There was a lot of rice which needed a bit more fat to bring it all together. 

The dinner items were good but the desserts were disappointing. 
(disappointed face)
The charred pineapple with pine nuts seemed like a health snack.
We didn't finish it.  It needed more charring.  More seasoning.  More anything.

The creme brule ... was completely boring.

The milk dessert looked as exciting as the creme boringness.

As for cocktails, I had the signature cocktail the Carmen... $14 bucks for 12 oz. mixed drink.  It was expensive and not really worth it.  

Overall, I had a good experience at Carmen, but when I compare Carmen to other tapas restaurants that have sprung up in Toronto, I can't say the food is stand-out.

But Carmen is worth a visit if you haven't been there, just leave room for dessert, somewhere else.",2013-05-14 02:22:29

In the past what attracted me to this place are the coupons available in the coupon clippings section in the Sunday paper. The coupon is for $19.95 with tire rotation and brake check or something. Maybe because of habit, I still go to Brakemasters sans coupon since I ask for synthetic oil for my oil change, I am able to go without an oil change up to 10k miles with synthetic compared to 5k with regular. 

What I like about this location is that it's not as busy in comparison to its location on dobson. PIus it's newer. So it's a short wait, a larger garage, and, why i really like Brakemasters is its free wi-fi. So no need to wait for oil change skimming through magazines, now I can still be connected to the world, either on yelp or facebook... YAY! 

I usually go for the deluxe oil change package that is, they top off and replace all fluids, check, and rotate my tires, and do my oil change. Brakemasters also repairs cars and does ac cleanings and the sort. Not once have I had a problem with my cars when they've done work on it.

They serve organic chicken and roast it on the premises which is great but could be a problem when the lunch time rushes start to hit.

The place is clean and tidy with a lot of staff but still seems slow. I'll chalk that up to the disorganization of just opening but they should work on their numbering system and communication. I was paged by a letter which I was told was on my bill but I only got a debit receipt (with no call letter on it). Calling out letters is confusing because on the counter they have a bunch of number placards for people dining in. I naturally assumed take out orders would follow the same logic. Just remember to ask your cashier what your letter or number is so they don't have to wander around trying to find you.

16 seats line the walls with two communal counter tops for 8 a piece in the centre. It doesn't feel that small but line ups for the order counter could quickly fill up the empty space. There are two bathrooms off to the right of the cash in a little hall.

The food was goodish. I had the buttermilk chicken finger sandwich with a side of fries. My side was tiny but sides usually are so it's no real surprise. The sandwich tasted just like a Big Mac on first bite which was a huge turn off and I actually considered not eating the rest. Since I paid $15 for it and I don't like wasting food, I soldiered on. After taking a piece of chicken out of the sandwich and eating it by itself I realized that the chicken is actually pretty good. It was soft and juicy and the fried covering wasn't overly greasy and tasted fairly light. The real problem was the sauce and how it over powered everything else in the bun except the sweet pickles. My fries weren't very exciting but like the chicken skin they weren't greasy so points for that. I like getting my food back to the office and not being able to see through the bag.

I'm giving Chickery 2 stars for the moment but I'm going to go back when they're firing on all cylinders and the kinks have been worked out. Stay tuned.",2012-04-30 17:28:57

We ordered Bulgarian salad and Vila platter for two. The waitress and one of the owners Luby was super nice. She explained about all kinds different Portuguese food. She was such a nice person, super nice. I really hate to give her restaurant low star review...

The salad... Fresh tomatoes,  fresh green bell pepper slices, fresh onion slices. Fresh shredded goat cheese on top. Delicious. We enjoyed it.

Vila platter for two... To tiny lobster tail (like you would get in Smith's or Albertsons), six shrimps (tough and hard), about six tiny pieces of calamari(chewy like rubber), two fried cod, two green mussels and tiny portion of white rice. Everything was previously frozen, of course. Even tasted frozen especially the lobster tail. $69.99. Really?!! This dish doesn't even fill one person up. Way over priced.

However, we had a simply magical experience, and I can see why finding a 7:00pm Saturday night invitation - even three months out - is still nearly impossible!

This place is about as hip and trendy and eclectic as a restaurant can get. Though I'm sure sitting outside is very nice in the summer, the interior is where it's at - dim lighting, pulsing music, wall murals, and quirky details abound. The music cranked up a few notches around 8 or 9pm when a DJ arrived, playing beats that my electroNOW Spotify playlist-loving self hadn't even heard before.

I thought that seating might feel a bit tight, but we were ushered to the second floor to large wooden bench style seats with plenty of room to spread out - and more importantly - to spread our food out.

I started with a cocktail from the specials list - a frozen blueberry margarita that our server mentioned being really delicious. Though sweet, it had a nice balance of flavors and was the perfect drink to end a hot summer day. I should have ordered another drink or two but was distracted talking with our friends that I never made up my mind on a second drink. In retrospect, the Strawberry Yuzu margarita on the menu looks absolutely heavenly...

For our appetizers, we picked out a guacamole from the long list and also ordered the Queso Fundido. I don't remember the exact guacamole that we ordered - unfortunately the listing isn't available online - but I know that it was a chef's special and included blue cheese and bacon. Now, I'm not a guacamole lover, the avocado texture grosses me out at times, but this stuff was a.ma.zing. However, even though I loved the guac, I quickly moved on to the queso when it arrived. I often judge a Mexican restaurant based on their queso, and this may be the best queso that I've had in my entire 30 years of life. The cheese was rich, thick, and gooey, the perfect mild white Mexican-style cheese. Typically, I like my queso relatively simple, paired with just some chips, but the dish was so well balanced and executed that I enjoyed the accompanying chorizo, peppers, and tortillas. I wrapped up the cheesy, meaty, peppery goodness into a tortilla and simply transcended into Mexican food paradise.

After such a heavenly queso experience, I didn't know if the tacos would impress, but of course, täkō delivered once again. The hubby and I ordered a special pork belly taco, the Al Pastor, and the Chorizo. All three were simply delicious with very clear, distinctive, well-executed flavors. I enjoyed the light, summery flavors of the Al Pastor, pork shoulder paired with pineapple and cilantro. Each Chorizo taco was covered in carmelized onions and topped with a runny fried egg, which is one of my favorite things to eat. The Mexican food paradise just kept going.

Unfortunately, I re-entered food reality with dessert. I had high expectations as täkō's sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye has always delivered very strongly here. My friend ordered what I understood to be cheesecake with berries, but it tasted and looked more like cheesecake pudding - descent, but by no means exciting or innovative. My husband and I ordered the churros and were a bit disappointed. The churro itself was bland and boring and the lack of chocolate dipping sauce was upsetting. We used some of our friend's cheesecake ""dip"" for our churros, but the dish was in desperate need of some chocolate and some salt.

Though I wish that I had ordered more tacos instead of trying dessert, I still had an absolutely incredible time and was highly impressed by the atmosphere, the decor, the service, and the food. This restaurant has officially landed itself in my Pittsburgh top 3, along with sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye and new(er) Spanish restaurant Morcilla. I am already looking to make reservations for when friends visit in October!",2016-07-17 16:35:47

Slamming deal on Tuesdays and I came at 9 and it was still pretty packed. I imagine it would be much busier right around dinner time. 

Only miss was how long the burger took. I came with a party of 6 and we didn't get our food for around 40m or so. That being said, you can't beat a gourmet burger with bacon and onion strings for $5-6!! Definitely would drop by again on Tuesday!",2018-02-26 02:30:03

Here is couple of items that I have tried on the menu.

Grilled Shrimp California Benedict: On their Brunch menu. I love it. Love the avocado. Love the shrimp. yummy. 

Beef Burger: I wasn't very impressed with their beef burger with Californian topping. They were a little cheap on the avocados spread. And, the burger appeared to be out of a box (Don't quote me, but it tasted a bit like Loblaw's burger). Hey, I like Loblaw's burger but I just feel a bit cheated when I'm getting grocery-store pre-packaged burger at a restaurant.

Pan Seared Scallops: There were 5-7 scallops which were very generous portion. However, it was a bit bland for a curry dish.

White Chocolate cheesecake: It was pretty good. Very rich.",2012-03-05 15:39:01
8hj_IvBwq-6RAanGQg7Ung,TCPLaprJm4FFei2DkW6K6g,aEtbXqbkf2BnwEVWQ2yjUw,3,6,0,3,"Taco Chelo is a little taqueria that recently opened up in that uber-cool area of Roosevelt. You know that neighborhood where all those giant apartment buildings mysteriously popped up overnight and look over a strange mixture of tiny homes that are either business-operated or completely abandoned? Yeah, that's the place. Graffiti is welcome. Parking is not. But Taco Chelo fits right in just fine. And it has a St. Francis connection to boot.

They had only been open for about a week when my girlfriend and I visited, so I was surprised to see a line going out the door this early in the game. But a lot of that has to do with the setup. Chelo has a little bar, but for food, they're shooting for the good ole' ""order at the counter"" approach. If you walk in through what appears to be the front door, you'll be very confused, as it's actually the exit. The beeline starts around back. It's a bit weird.

Given the layout of the restaurant, I'm not so sure if this is the best idea and I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually abandon it - especially if they want their servers earning tip money. It just felt like kind of a mess.

The menu is fairly simple, with a few appetizers and traditional street tacos that fall somewhere in-between taco truck prices and hoity-toity taco prices. They might want to update their website, because the big bowl of guac pictured on their menu isn't quite an accurate representation of the actual teaspoon-sized serving in a plastic cup that you actually get. Nevertheless, their guacamole was excellent, or at least what little of it I was actually able to try. Their quesadilla, although much smaller than what you're probably accustomed to, was also a respectable starter.

The menu on their website states that their tacos come with lime, but ours did not. My girlfriend had to cut through the line to request them, which they had to retrieve from the bar. In terms of their flavor, it's sort of a mixed bag. We both found the carnitas to be a bit too dry, while the barbacoa was just so-so and pretty much comparable to what you'd find at any run-of-the-mill taco place. The asada was actually a bit surprise, having a nice smoky flavoring that I wasn't expecting. We would have been better off just ordering a plateful of those.

When we left, the line was even longer, so clearly many people are very eager to try this place. And given their whole trendy and lively setup, I'm sure they'll do just fine. But to put it bluntly, it's really nothing groundbreaking. Everything you can find here can also be found within spitting distance. But prices are reasonable and the food is mostly decent, but as a few other reviewers have noted: Competition is stiff. 

Check them out.",2018-03-17 20:24:14
zMkaFCZ0uOQRBQLhk3vRoA,bSY04kIrbB3J9cyNBiKfcQ,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,2,0,1,0,"With this review, I'll start off with 5 stars and start subtracting stars for things I found off with the place:

Start - 5 stars
-1 star - $20 cover on a Wednesday night, really?
-1 star - Wednesday is ladies night, but it was definitely a sausage fest, clever marketing team you've got there...
-1 star - pricey drinks for a place that is not close to the strip
Bottom line - 2 stars

It's too bad because I wanted to like this place after talking to my friends who live in Vegas and have gone many times in the past.  I think they go for the happy hour specials but this review was for getting in around 11pm on a Wednesday night.  I was told that it was ladies night but I guess a bunch of guys got the same memo so the sausage to taco ratio was skewed toward the sausages.

On top of that, the drinks were pretty weak for what they charge - $9 for Stoli and a mixer and you can barely tell there is alcohol in your drink.  My friends were paying $12 or $13 for martinis but I guess they give you a little more since they give you the shaker to take with you and pour the rest when you're ready.

Would I come back?  Maybe...  I think I'll have to show up for happy hour since it seems like that's when they have the best deals but I wonder if they will charge a cover just to get into happy hour??",2011-08-01 01:10:10

A couple of chain yogurt places came up as did La Neveria which was just a block and a half from where I was.  La Neveria is Spanish for the ice cream parlor.

I found the store quickly.  On entering, I noticed it was crowded but there were some seats available.  I took my time studying the various options--a shake, a smoothie, food, or just ice cream.  I ended up getting the ice cream I came for.  After looking at the different flavors, I ordered a two scoop cup of guanabana and pineapple-coconut. I used to drink guanabana juice on breaks during my working days and I like the flavor.  

After paying and getting my cup, I noticed that the group who had been at the long counter at the windows had gone and I had a great seat waiting.  

The ice cream was good.  It's not artisan ice cream but it's good and it hit the spot.  The women working the counter were pleasant and helpful.  The place was clean and bright.

I loved the facilities then and they've even recently updated everything (March 2014).  Looks like they moved around some staff offices and gave members more workout space.

The renovation brought super clean/modern look to the place and added food/snack bar which is so great especially for the after workout refueling routine.

I can't really say much about the ladies locker room, but the guys locker room has gotten a major face lift and is a nice space to change and get ready in.  

I've started recently swimming so the pool facilities here are great and the Y provides towel service, so you don't have to have a wet towel in your gym bag or call all day after a morning swim.  I did talk to one of the lifeguards and he said the 2nd phase of the renovation will happen and the pool will be updated - exciting stuff, however with the Dowd pool, and MAC pool being renovated at the same time, this place will start picking up with swim traffic (anticipated).... we will see, but for now I do like my ""controlled drowning"" to be kept to mostly myself.

What other mall in the city boasts a Zellers, Toronto's oldest sports bar (P.M. Toronto), an LCBO and an off-track betting establishment?  No one, that's who!  

The main reason I used to venture out to the Galleria with my housemates was to hit up the Price Chopper for a regrettable afternoon of grocery shopping.  Occasionally the pharmacy there would do in a pinch to grab some cough syrup or bandaids, and of course the LCBO so close by was a plus as well.  The cast of characters who inhabit this mall seem like they could be Canadian versions of the cast of Little Britain - colorful and nearly impossibly real.

The atmosphere is inviting. The seating is comfortable and the service is outstanding!

For this visit, my dinner group met to explore the flavors of Spain. Some of us started out with the Sangria which was delicious. For my meal, I ordered the gazpacho and the Paella de Carne. Everything was beautifully presented. 

The gazpacho was flavorful but a tad bit too salty. The paella was a great alternative to the traditional seafood paella and came chicken, lamb, chorizo and a cut of beef topped with chimichurri in the middle of a large dish of Spanish rice. It was enough food for 3 people and all of us who ordered it ended up taking some home.

For desert, I ordered the Flan but they have about 10 different desserts available if you save room for it! The flan was light and delightful and mildly sweet.

G_tVyYZXGSSL5taJCENvPA,jlu4CztcSxrKx56ba1a5AQ,HkHTdTvzbn-bmeQv_-2u0Q,5,6,5,9,"Came here for the Winterlicious 2016 Dinner $25 Tasting menu.

I've always seen Bannock, because it's located RIGHT beside the Eaton Center, but have never visited and I'm glad I decided to go in this year, even though it's under renovations. O&B are Torontonian faves of course! Making reservation at 6pm and dining at that time is great because not many people eat dinner at this time. Bannock began to fill up by 7pm, and for those who go as couples, you might feel a little squished in their seats.

It's really interesting to note that dinner is $25 though lunch is $18, I suppose it's because much less people show up for lunch - however they offer mainly the same dishes and I'd like to believe that they are the same size. It's a really interesting marketing technique because most people aren't available for lunch.

For $25, you were able to have a starter, a main and a dessert. There were three choices for the starter, four choices for the main and three choices for the dessert. I love being able to go with someone else because we were able to try 6 dishes! 

STARTERS: 
1) Winter Greens and Wheatberries (vegetarian/local) ermite blue cheese, apples, tarragon:

I've never had winter greens raw before and though that the texture of the leaves were really interesting - especially in a salad form. It's much more ""bubbly"" than other types of leaves. I thought that the granny smith apples were super complimentary to the salad because it added to the sour taste, which could replace the balsamic vinegar. 

2) Suhas' Curried Tamarack Farms Pumpkin Soup (vegetarian/local)
pepitas, crème fraîche

This was my favourite one. Curry with thick creamy pumpkin soup, sprinkled lightly with toasted and seasoned pumpkin seeds - absolutely to die for!

MAINS:
1) Griddled Pork Shoulder Steak (local) beer mustard, warm sherried lentils, collard greens, screeched prunes:

We got this because it was the only item different from the lunch menu. This dish really reminded of the food I had in Europe when I went on a tour and had three courses everyday for lunch and dinner for two weeks. The pork shoulder was extremely tender, but like most European dishes that I dislike - too SALTY. But hey, that apparently is a cultural thing and I only learned that from travelling to roughly 30 cities in Europe when restaurants have told us most Chinese tours tell them to decrease the salt. 

2) Northern Woods Oyster Mushroom Pizza (vegetarian/local) mushroom and thunder oak gouda mornay, arugula, onions:

I had no idea 王子菇 were called Oyster Mushrooms. Definitely a HUGE dish on a thin sliced of pita, sprinkled lightly with their mushroom, arugula and cheese. Not overly filling, but just the right amount. 

DESSERT:
These portions were a little smaller than others. Someone with such a big sweet tooth - I really wasn't too overwhelmed with their dessert, but I guess O&B isn't famous for their desserts. 

1) Moonshine Pannacotta (local) nice spice, stewed apples, cranberries.
Smooth Pannacotta drizzled with cranberries and stewed apples on the side.

2) Warm Sugar Beet and Chocolate Cake (vegetarian/local)
Tasted like a huge brownie.",2016-01-31 17:20:33

My kids love olives and to get a couple on the chicken plate it costs extra. My husband ordered the bowl and it's strange, there's no rice or anything, just chicken and hummus and chick pea. He decided to buy a side of pita chips but they were stale and disgusting. He immediately took them back. No apology was given, the lady actually looked pissed that he said anything. She gave him fries instead but was really weird about it. None of the food had much flavor and the pita bread was really chewy.

This is the spring training facility for the NL West San Francisco giants and man it is simply a beautiful ballpark. I visited this park last week when they played my Chicago White Sox and while it was rain delayed for about an hour the game was played. When the sun did finally come out it turned out to be just a picture perfect day for baseball...and i got 4 autographs that day from my beloved white sox players and staff. The stadium while small like most spring training facilities was well groomed, clean and all the vendors there were very friendly.

The field drained beautifully despite all the rain and even the grass areas for the fans beyond the outfield were still in good shape. In fact they were in such good shape there were plenty of people still sitting out there to get some potential home run balls. Some people were even rolling down the hill out there and having a grand time...definitely where the party was at...LOL. The prices for food and beer were a bit steep but i have learned that is the case for most cactus league stadiums so i won't knock that.

The other great thing about this stadium is that it is within walking distance to downtown Scottsdale and Old Town Scottsdale, which is a very popular tourist destination. You can also park down there take a free trolley to the game and then return back to your car and enjoy a late lunch, shopping, site seeing, or dinner before heading home. So if your ever in Scottsdale and your a baseball fan plan a full day of activity here and i guarantee you will go back home with a few memories.

It's in the basement of Dante, so we were a little confused when trying to find the place. You have to walk down a stairwell to the right of Dante. 

We arrived in time for happy hour, so we decided to try one special roll (Ginko roll) and 3 Happy Hour rolls (Spicy tuna, salmon, and the special of the day roll, shrimp salad).  The special rolls are pretty expensive, and the one we got was pretty small. Nothing about it really stood out as being any better than any other sushi I've had. The happy hour rolls were $5 each and they were good but didn't have much in them. I was mostly tasting rice. 

We also ordered the oyster appetizer. It was $12 for 6 oysters with special toppings. It was very average. I did not really care for the fried oyster, as it could have been a fried piece of dough for what it tasted like - you just tasted the sauce. The other raw oysters, while they tasted fine, did not seem to be as fresh as they could have been. But I wasn't expecting the best oysters from a sushi place in Ohio anyway.

It's a neat if confusing concept.

The problem I have with this place is that it's almost impossible to get the attention of one of the cooks making whatever you want to order. Really my friends and I were the only ones in line standing around for a good 3-4 minutes waiting to order a pizza. Which brings me to another point, the pizza here is nothing special to write home about. I jazzed it up with some of the herbs in the pots which I thought was a great idea(that's what they're there for right?), and a healthy dose of olive oil to liven it up. If I was paying regular prices for the pizza I would have said no sir, especially since you are pretty much doing everything but the cooking yourself! But seeing as they have a $5 special on pizza almost every day, I think it's just fine to pop in for a carb loaded snack before you set off to do something else in uptown.

It's a small place and I'm sure it can get filled very quickly, but for a Sunday night after 9PM, there weren't many people. (In hindsight, I realize this is probably because most people were watching fireworks.) I sat at the bar, since it was just me. I was waited on by two of the waitstaff, a guy and girl, both very friendly and helpful.

I started off with a drink, Billie Joe, because I wanted something with gin. This was smooth as hell for a gin drink. If ordering oysters, you are required to order by 6. Kind of odd, but I suppose if you're getting oysters, you aren't going to get 1 or 2 at a time. They come with 2 sauces, which other reviews mentioned. They were tasty but I could have done without them. To be honest, I preferred the lemon wedged squeezed onto the oysters, and maybe some vinegar. Keep it simple.

After the oysters, I tried another drink, Mavis. To me, this was a new take on a Manhattan. To the bartender, who was awesome, it was his take on a tiki drink that wasn't cloyingly sweet. It was a very light, almost kind of summery, Manhattan. Definitely a winner. I also ordered a couple pieces of the applejack nigeri. It's very, very delicate in flavor, but good. This would be a good introductory fish to the world of nigeri/sashimi. It's not overtly fishy or briny.

It is a bit pricey. It's not a place I would/could come to all the time, but I definitely will return again. I've got to try the rest of the killer cocktails, as well as some of the apps/tapas they have on their regular menu.",2016-07-04 18:59:32

Anyway, place is somewhat hidden within J-Town.  There's no awning or obvious signage, but Sasaki shares the same space as Tora Sushi.  The word ""pastry"" is somewhat misleading as I associate pastry with flaky desserts that are baked.

I didn't find that Sakura had any distinct flavour.  It was very subtle, sorta tasted like genmaicha.  Strawberry & Matcha, on the other hand, were stronger, stuffed with red bean + a flavoured cream.  All were very soft, delicious, & not too sweet as mentioned in the other reviews.

Pros
+ The rooms are awesome...spacious, comfortable beds, quality linens & toiletries, kitchenette.

+ Free WiFi.

+ Lobby Bar is a great place to unwind for a drink or three.

+ Customer service was great during out trip.  Kudos to the front desk, bartenders, and bellmen who assisted us.

+ Great views.  You can see the Strip from one side of the tower and the Vegas Valley from the other side.

Cons
- The biggest negative was the fact that after 7 am or so, the freakin' trains start to run through the city and blast their horns at all of the train crossings.....there's at least 3 or 4 crossings in Vegas and you can hear that train through the windows and walls of your room.  If you're a light sleeper or bothered by this kind of noise, you can forget about sleeping in.

- The valet parking is inadequate.  The waiting area outside to pick up your car was not meant for a full blown hotel.  It was meant for a condo tower....so it's not made to handle the constant in/out volume of a large Vegas hotel.  It also doesn't handle the cabs, limos, and shuttles very well either.  So you end up waiting for your car inside the lobby and try to see through the lanes of other cars to pick yours up when it's ready.

The 2 negative items are big ones for me and that's why this place gets 3 Stars in my opinion....otherwise, it could've earned 4 Stars.

There's also no casino at this hotel....which can be a positive or a negative to some people.  I'm indifferent.

I had visited this location twice.  You are brought out their sourdough bread to begin with.   Hot and delicious!  The first time I had ordered the New England Clam Chowder and Macadamia Nut Crusted Salmon.   I really loved the idea of the fish but the flavor just didn't coincide with what I imagined.  It lacked any flavor...  just bland.  Bummer.  The soup was great.   Very creamy and filling.

So on the second visit I wanted to get the soup again to see if it was consistent with my previous visit.   Yep!  Great and flavorful!  Since I was disappointed with the fish the first time, I went with their Seafood Cobb Salad.  My husband actually ordered a different type of salmon on the menu.   Again, his fish was a disappointment.  Lacked any flavor.  Even his rosemary potatoes were sad.  They were over salted and not even cooked through.   My salad was just ok.  The shrimp were very sad little pieces.  The scallops didn't even appease me.  At least the soup and bread were still good.  It's probably not enough to keep me coming back here though.  

They do have a sushi bar connected and I didn't try this yet.  There may be a possibility of trying it but the entrees have been such a let down that I doubt it.  

The three stars were given only because of the fantastic service they deliver here.   On both occasions, the waiters were so attentive and friendly.   They deserve all of the praise!",2013-11-16 19:03:04

The place has interesting homey decor.  Almost all tables are compartmentalized into booths so it makes you feel like you have some privacy in your conversations.  

It's also a mix of Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisine which is kind of interesting.  Normally, I don't like going to places that mix different Asian cuisines together because I just don't find that they can master all of them but this place was actually pretty good. 

My friend and I both ordered sashimi salad with a side of salmon maki.  My other friend ordered a mix of sushi and sashmi.  

After ordering, we were served soup, a plate of fried appetizers (potato ball, deep fried zuchini and something else) and then a platter of more apps including a potato and apple salad (covered in mayo which isn't common for an asian restaurant), jap chae (korean glass noodles), broccoli, tofu and I think a few others that I can't recall.  The apps were decent...nothing amazing but definitely a nice to have.  

The staff were super attentive to us and came around often to serve us tea, refill apps etc. 

The sashimi salad was huge.  It had a mix of salmon and tuna (I think) sashimi overtop lettuce, beets, avocado and a mix of other vegatbles and nori.  Even though this is listed on the appetizer section of the menu...it is by no means an appetizer! It is a fulll on meal itself! Also, it came with a bowl of white rice which in no way I was able to finish.  I couldn't even finish the salad actually because it was that big!   

The salmon maki was good.  The fish was fresh and there's a good ratio of salmon to rice (i.e. not too much rice).

Overall, I liked Sam Jung.  The fish was fresh, the staff were attentive, and there were decent apps that I didn't expect to get (always a nice surprise!).",2014-03-16 03:14:47

We ordered some wings (29 cents on Tues) trio of grilled cheese sliders and a mixed green salad with blackened salmon.... All the food was super tasty, and even though my salmon was not blackened - it was still pretty good. (They also removed the salmon from our bill - how nice!)

b2hy8nXb0mfrdONR1RsDvg,BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw,3,11,10,9,"Customer service would seem to be the hamartia of Café la Gaffe. Me and my DC wandered in around 7:30pm for dinner. Their front patio was full, but I learned they have a Smoke Free Back Patio which are probably four of my favourite words in the english language. 

We were led to the back (pointed, really) along is a route that takes you through the narrow restaurant, past the kitchen, through a ramshackle corridor and finally on to the secluded garden patio. They actually manage to cram in quite a few tables considering the modest size of the space. The partial roof means plenty of shade and they have a gas heater for colder nights. It's a lovely spot.

A few moments after sitting down, our server politely asked us to move from our table (which was at the end of a row of two tops pushed together) to a separate table for two since they often get busy during dinner. This is an understandable position, but if they are particular about this they could have seated us properly, instead of waving us toward the back of the restaurant.

Anyway, we were famished so we got set to order. There was a full page of specials as well as a road-map sized menu. There were a lot of compelling selections. I chose the penne with beef, sausage served in rose sauce, and a starter of mussels in a Thai-inspired curry broth after I saw a girl furiously devouring these on the way in.

The portion sizes are generous and this is not helped by the fact that  our meals were really, freaking, good. The mussels' broth was brimming with awesome flavours, and I couldn't help sopping it all up with bread. It would have made a killer soup all on its own. The penne was just loaded with delicious stuff: spicy sausage, mushrooms, and slices of tender steak. My bowl of pasta was enough for two servings and I ate pretty much the entire thing. 

Foodwise, I had no complaints but getting served was another story. They are dangerously understaffed, or at least, disorganized. Our server was managing both the front patio and the back patio (and no doubt getting flagged down in between), which made her visits painfully infrequent. It took more almost half an hour after we finished eating to procure our cheque. I noted by the receipt that it had been printed ages before we finally got it, but clearly she hadn't had a chance to bring it our way. We waited another 25 minutes with the credit card sitting on the table before I hunted her down myself. When she conceded that ""she hadn't been back there in a while"" like the back patio was a college bar or the neighbourhood she grew up in, I realised that this type of thing probably happens a lot. I think they need another server on during suppertime, or at least divide up the dining room sensibly. Imagine working the extreme ends of a restaurant!

I can come here knowing I can rely on their excellent kitchen, but only if I have copious amounts of time to burn. Perhaps off-hours is when they really shine.

Obligatory Title Pun: Their only GAFFE is tardiness.

Menu Readability: The menu is the size of a wakeboard, laminated and slathered in the worst calligraphic typeface, all bold.

Need to mention: While it did get busy that night, not enough that we really had to have given up our seats. Too bad. Being corrected shouldn't be a customer's first interaction with your staff.

Unfortunately, since it was after noon, many of my favorites were sold out (boo!) but this gave me a chance to sample some new treats.

I got an apple and hazelnut tart.  It was good-the pastry was super crumbly but not overbuttery but there were maybe only two small pieces of hazelnut on each tart.

I got the cinnamon roll (don't recall the french name) and it was wonderful-very flaky, buttery and just the right amount of sugar and cinnamon.

I also got the pain du chocolat and it was sublime.  The chocolate was semi-sweet and super good and the pastry was flaky and buttery.

The only reason I am giving La Gourmandine 4 stars is that I received poor service.  I told the girl at the counter that I would be getting at least 5 or 6 things (ergo, the need for a largish container).  Instead of getting a box, she started SHOVING 2-3 pastries into bags clearly designed for 1.  When I asked her if she could put everything in a box, she was very put out.

We loved the sambusa , they came out piping hot with a nice dipping sauce. The platter was good as well. It just depends what you like I guess. The meat dishes were good except for a dish which was mostly bones lol i wasn't fond of the spinach dish either. I did like the injera, it was super filling.

I recall the first time one of my co-workers brought back lunch from the Chickery and I commented that they got lunch from Swiss Chalet.

This place is fairly large on the inside, though most of the seating indoors is occupied by people waiting for take out. It's very clean, though kind of looks like a KFC in the kitchen. There aren't that many ways to order your chicken. They mainly highlight their roasted chicken and their chicken fingers. I ordered the 1/4 roasted chicken ($12) with gravy and the mac and cheese. The wait wasn't that long, maybe 10 minutes max.

I brought it back to the office and opened it up and was a little disappointed with the size of the 1/4 chicken. It's probably easily the same size as the 3-piece chicken ($11), though technically the 1/4 chicken was 2 pieces. The chicken, however, was delicious. I'll give you that, Chickery. The mac and cheese was good as well, but nothing to call home about.

The Chickery was very inconsistent today, as we compared our lunches at work. One person ordered the 2-piece chicken fingers with mac and cheese. He received a 3-piece chicken finger (not an option on the menu) and his mac and cheese didn't have breaded toppings like mine did. Another co-worker ordered the 3-piece chicken, but only received 2 pieces. So my warning is to check what you receive before leaving the establishment.",2013-05-31 23:41:21

Located in Village Center Circle it's a quick stop for the Summerlin residents. This location prior was a Hagen grocery store for about a year and prior to that ,it was a Vons (sister store to Safeway and Cars) for my readers across the U.S.

Moving forward, after Hagen closed we were left with a empty spot and no grocery store :(. This was like a whole year with the only nearby option being a over packed Smiths! Most of us welcomed the Albertsons with a ,"" finally we get a grocery store again,hooray!"" attitude. I am happy to have another store nearby,however Albertsons offers no fuel point rewards and doesn't even offer a reward program of any type for that matter. I'm really bummed about that. That was definitely the deal breaker for me. I will not be doing my ""major"" grocery shopping here.

Overall it's a clean store with an ok selection. I guess something close is better than nothing, as far as running in for a quick item.

This has been the worst place I have ever been in a long time.

I ordered a mango mojito, and got some berry drink instead. When I asked my server about it, the response i got was ""Oh, I thought that's what you ordered"" and ""I will bring you mango mojito next time.""

Both my friend's salad and my entree had to be send back. (Which she never do and I rarely do.) She ordered a blackberry brie salad. She got pecan cranberry instead. We were told the manager made her second salad, which is 1/2 the size, with 4 blackberry, 4 tiny see through slices of brie, still has the pecan for the unknown reason, and few lettuce. 

When I got my med-rare ahi tuna entree, my friend thought I have gotten salmon because it's not the healthy redish tuna color but the whiteish pink color. It was way over cooked! When I address this to our waiter, he just looked at it and say ""yeah, that's way over cooked"" and walked away. It's not till minutes later he asked if I would like them to remake the tuna. The second tuna I got was not any better. It tasted like they put 5 times the seasoning for the whole plate on the little fishes that they serve. It was way over salted and almost tasted gross. 

And funny thing was, it was then I really came to appreciate how tart my berry drink is. It took that saltiness off the tuna. 

Anyway, with the price of the menu, we were really hoping for a better experience. We didn't get that. We got surprises and questions about how a restaurant  can screw up so much for one table. Mind you, there were maybe only three tables when we first got there on a Saturday night. (And the only table left when we got our food.) We both agree this place don't have a very good chance.

We just discovered this place, they had a booth set up at Party with Your Pooch in Town Square. The girls at the booth were great, I liked them on first impression.  They were giving special grooming prices if we booked that night, our dog is a big hair ball so we decided to give them a try. The fact that they are pretty close to home didn't hurt.
We had our pup groomed the next day and asked if they could do a daycare evaluation while he was there and they agreed, no problem. We even got a tour before we left, they have nice big play areas.
Our pups groom looked great, from nose to tail (or nub). He seemed very happy when we picked him up and then immediately fell asleep when he got in the car (that's a good sign).
We decided to give a full day of daycare a try a couple days later. Again I got back a happy sleepy eyed boy. 
Every employee I encountered was friendly and helpful and put me at ease leaving my boy in their hands.
My only gripe is their camera viewing app, I like to be able to look in on him when I'm  at work. The view is really tiny on my phone and the app expires often. I would like to be able to pull up a view on my computer but I have to deal with what they use.

""Traditional"" British chips from a chippy are meant to be thick cut, skinless, borderline soggy, soft and best served in paper, with loads of salt and vinegar. And they're amazing, despite sounding kind of gross.

All the chips here seem to be skin-on, thin (like French fries), and crispy, usually overcooked. 

So anyway, we popped in here today after hearing it's meant to be ""pretty close to real English fish and chips"".. sorry to all who've told me that, you're completely wrong, it's nowhere near similar. Like, at all. 

The cod was $11 and the fillet was very thin- it didn't have a lot of flavour, and the batter was both too crispy and also mostly chewy. Undercooked and very pale too :/ 
The chips weren't exactly bad, they were just overdone and a lot of them were just the nubby dregs. 

Hate to say it but my boyfriend said it was the ""shittiest fish and chips"" he's ever had and left his whole portion of chips, and I also had about 10 before I left them behind.

Today was yet another superb visit and this time with  the incredible Apple guy himself: Ron, for business.  He greeted and welcomed us to the store individually and was an overall great guy that we had the pleasure of working with and was very patient and informative and aided in product information with an allotted schedule time of an hour with undivided attention that was greatly appreciated.  

I referred and shopped/decision made with Heath (the bf).  I am very happy he has gotten himself an upgrade with a new computer for his business and can kick that piece of 2005...@#$% previous laptop out the door or bury it! ;)  

We were in today to look at various Apple products since he has never used or owned an Apple. The various products we viewed: iMac mini, iMac, Macbook Pro and the Macbook Air.  The WINNERS.... for his Needs and my Sanity (since he lost his patience with his busted computer countless times)....was both the iMac mini and the Macbook Pro! 

Now regarding size... and yes size matters!  I have to agree that you can't downgrade from being a 17"" laptop user to a 13"" by any means. ""Bigger IS Better"" they say, (ahem-again, I agree!). Since my 2009 Macbook Pro 17"" and his well...other brand - Apple NO longer carries the 17"" in laptops, so the 15"" was a compromise to our preference. The talked about screen to go along with the iMac mini...his 47"" screen....DAAAAMN! Yeah, I know INSANE.

First off, this is a GREAT neighborhood Chinese take out place.  This is not supposed to be the end-all, be-all of Chinese take out.

We decided to go on a Saturday at lunchtime (around 12:30ish), so we figured it might be busy.  It wasn't completely full, but it's a big place and most of the tables were occupied.  The numerous TV's had college games on, which we love, so that was enjoyable.  We were seated, and our waitress came right over for our drink order.  As soon as our drinks were brought over, we ordered an appetizer (potato skins), and told her to give us a few minutes to decide on our entrees.  She came back a few minutes later, and we ordered...no problem with service, in our eyes.

The potato skins were really good.  They gave us 2 nice scoops of sour cream (hubby always complains that most places never give you enough to put on the skins).  They weren't greasy, and were cut in inch wide strips, as opposed to scooped out.  I found them easier to eat this way.  Not too much cheese, a nice amount of bacon, love the chives added on and they were crispy.  (A busboy came over after we finished, and asked if he could take our plate.)

A few minutes later, our main courses arrived.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich.  In the picture it showed cole slaw on it, but it was actually on the side.  So, he piled it onto the pork.  I got the American Soldier burger--no cheese-- with a side of onion rings.  I also asked for a bit of BBQ sauce for my burger, which was quickly brought over.  While I was setting up my burger, putting the red onions, tomatoes, mustard and BBQ sauce on it, my husband downed his sandwich.  I think he liked it!  My burger was cooked perfectly, nice and charred on the outside, but juicy inside.  The only issue I had was the bun being a little too big.  But, that's a personal taste thing, and my husband loved the bun.  The onion rings were crispy, and I used the extra BBQ sauce to dip them in.  My husbands fries looked pretty good, and he seemed to enjoy them.

Overall, the food was pretty good, and the service was nice.  There were lots of waitresses around, but they all seemed to be helping tables and not standing around chatting.  So, maybe someone is reading the reviews and made some changes.

Also, as a side note, the bathrooms are big and clean (at least they were on a Saturday afternoon).  I'm sure on a Friday or Saturday night, the place is loud and hopping.

They have some ""patio""seating right outside their restaurant but I wouldn't suggest it because you get pedestrians walking by you on one side and dust and pollution from cars on the other side (streets). The inside is worth sitting at even if it's nice and sunny out because their interior designs are nice and if you have a big group, youe table becomes candle light dinners.

They make their own baseball size really good meatballs which comes classic or stuffed for about $13 to $14. Its really good and definitely a must try. They hand pull their mozzarella and make their own pasta Italian style. Their pasta comes in gluten free and whole wheat upon request. Their pasta is really good though. Better than the spaghetti factory.

""Social"" is basically appetizer or for sharing portions. A small was good enough for my meal for the pasta but they also come in large and social.

They have a good wine list and a section of it called generous wine is basically Italian or Niagara table wine which comes in half litre or one liter size for $16-20.

Their bar side  closes around 2 am so you can always comr for a few drinks after work. They are affiliated with SIR Corp. Oh if you sign up with their Social Club you get $10 off from your next purchase of $30!",2015-06-10 01:24:21

You see, a friend of mine took a course with Barry Fairburn (glass-blower extraordinaire), and it just so happens that he created the majority of art work that appears in Hotel Arts. He told his students to head over to this hotel and ride the elevator exploring his art. So that's precisely what my friend did, along with me, as his trustee companion. 

First of all: the staff at Hotel Arts is nothing short of professional. You can imagine how sheepish we felt asking to 'ride the elevator', but it was not a problem. I appreciated the fact that you have to have a room key in order to use the elevator - which is extremely considerate for hotel guests because they don't need to worry about 'strays' wandering in. 

As we went from one floor to the next admiring Mr. Fairburn's impeccable hand-blown glass, one thing was clear: this hotel supports nothing but the best. 

Between the art, the service, the ambiance, the decor and the rooms, I would argue that Hotel Arts is one of the nicest & trendiest hotels in town.",2010-03-18 18:41:44

A celeriac salad seemed different and adventurous, but turned out to be odd and disappointing.  It was very heavy on the mustard  and had too much dressing.  Odder still was the decision to include a poached egg croquette.  Having egg yolk exploding over what was already a too-wet salad just seemed bizarre.  (If served with some toast, the egg croquette would have been a great idea.)

My main course was rabbit served in a mac cheese dish.  I know, I was asking for trouble, but I got so much more than I deserved.  The dish was headlined as ""Braised Rabbit.""   Well, I'm sorry but this rabbit was not braised in the slightest.  It was boiled in a béchamel sauce.  Unfortunately, it wasn't boiled long enough for the ""pasta shells""  - which were really about the thickness of gnocchi - to cook through.  But that's not the worst of it.  The dish didn't include cheese within the béchamel.  Instead it was actually capped with a very thick layer of Fontina cheese, like a french onion soup. Fontina is strong enough in small quantities.  When plastered across the entire dish, no other ingredient even had a chance.  For no apparent reason, this dish was also accompanied by some sort of meat croquette.  ""Micro greens"" mentioned in the description turned out to be a tiny garnish rather than an ingredient.

My S.O. was similarly disappointed in her main (though her's looked better than mine).  She had the pork belly.  And yes, it too included a croquette.  

Like the food, the music was similarly odd and seemed to be trying too hard.  We literally listened to a full hour of atonal Hammond B3 solos.  No, I'm not exaggerating.  I had lots of time to think it through.  Someone actually played it and thought it sounded good and someone else recorded it and didn't throw the tapes away,  etc. Leading all the way to this restauranteur thinking ""Say, I'll bet our diners would like to listen to a full hour of atonal Hammond B3 solos.""  I'm guessing the person who designed the menu also selected the music.",2012-10-14 01:36:17

As we entered the place smelled not of Mexican food but of stale mop water as they were swabbing the floors early. Ordered a red beef burrito and a hard taco/cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans with 2 sodas that came out to $21.60. As previous reviewers have noted their POS machine asks for immediate payment AND a tip choice before service has even started. NOT an appropriate point to make this decision at all. 
So after payment, the cashier hands you two empty cups and two small bowls of chips that were overcooked and tasted like they had been cooked quite some time ago of which few we ever ate. Several average tasting salsas and Pico de Gallo were available on a self serve bar. Food was soso overall. Enchilada was pretty good with good red sauce but small for the price. Hard Taco was cold and made with what looked like a prefab shell. Shredded beef ok quality but again cold and unappetizing. Refried beans average and rice was tasteless and cold served on a styrofoam plate. Drink refills were 25 cents with a big bright yellow reminder on the soda machine. Overall take here is a fast food joint trying to act like a full service higher quality Mexican restaurant but just not pulling it off at all. Not worth the prices they charge and just not a good experience overall. Reaffirmed my decision to not return.",2018-09-04 09:55:55
mgYXWH0iobvwIk1yVNQNbw,9I-kXfb7-1iAQFvHplk1PA,2qjvYspb3bEmCaw1vmSk0g,3,1,0,0,"I haven't felt compelled to review anything in a while, so it sucks that this review needed to come out.

I am a frequent customer at Sushi Muramoto.  They have the best Japanese food in Madison (don't LOL too much outsiders).  I usually order to go, but have dined in many times also.

They have a wonderful sushi menu that consistently delivers in plating, flavor, texture and punch.  Without going overboard (remember were still in Madison... we're NOT the sushi capital of the world, but it's real good all things considered), I have never had a roll, nigiri or sashimi there that I wouldn't rinse (with ginger) and repeat.  

I have become very partial to their lunch menu. 

It's cheap, delicious and provides a little fusion fun. Better yet, it's a HUGE bargain.  My favorite on the menu is their hanger steak.  For $9.00 you get a solid amount of seared tender meat coated in an Asian barbecue sauce, a side of well-dressed rice and amazing potato salad [with decadent hints of wasabi and honey and ikura (which surprisingly works)]. Besides that, you get a wonderful salad with the most addictive dressing I've had. 

Why only three stars?

I've eaten here dozens of times, but my returns have been far less frequent.  The problem is the disorganization up front.  

As referenced earlier, I am a ""to go"" customer. I order to go  because I live very close.  The weekend lunch hostess is a hot mess and I never experienced anything like this with any establishment. 

For a restaurant that focuses on such perfection on nearly all aspects of its food and decor, can't get a glaring weakness right upfront.  

1) Their order completion times for generally short turn around orders are insane (they give 45 minutes to an hour for pick up times).

2) If you call any time for lunch, expect that your food will not be finished when they tell you a certain time.  The last several times, I left home when it was due and still waited 15 minutes for takeout at the restaurant. 

3) You have to review your orders like a hawk.  There are frequent mistakes made on relatively simple orders (for example, missing salads).

It's a given... they are ALWAYS busy, but the problem is the hostess that has worked the last few months or so.  #1 has been a problem for years. However, #'s 2 and 3 have popped up with the new hostess. It's not a growing pain issue because her lack of attention to detail and atrocious time management have been getting worse and are completely unacceptable and negatively impact my overall feelings of this restaurant; in fact, there's no perceived sense of urgency from her.  The more this continues, the less likely I'll come back to this otherwise great (although very pretentious) establishment. 

Note:  The dine in service is slow and a couple people seem to be walking around aimlessly on the floor, but it's not as severe as anything up front.

Tips: 
For lunch takeout...
1) I would not order unless you have at least an hour to wait.
2) If you go there before it's ready and seats are available, pop a squat at the bar and play with your phone (might as well get comfortable and not stand like a fool at the front counter as mobs try to run around/thru you).
3.) If you live close, force them to call you to pick up the food to avoid the aggravation of waiting when you know that your food wasn't even started by the time you get there.",2015-04-18 18:43:54

I came at an odd hour but definitely was hungry for lunch!  I ordered the beef carpaccio, lemongrass tofu, and Vietnamese iced coffee.  My waitress was excellent and friendly.  I believe the owners were there, and one showed me how to eat the beef by wrapping the thin meat around a daikon-carrot-onion salad with peanuts and dipping it in a nuoc cham with wasabi.

This really was enough food for lunch, but I sampled my lemongrass tofu and took it to go.  It came with rice and salad.  Plenty for 2 meals!  The iced coffee was strong and delicious.  The tofu did say on the menu that it was ""5-alarm"" but it was hardly spicy, so that was slightly disappointing.  However, I had never had beef carpaccio Viet-style, so that was a real treat.  The meat was sliced so thin.

I will definitely return and try other things (bun, pho, etc.) and there were other neat appetizers.  Carpaccio $8.50, tofu $7, iced coffee $3.25.",2009-05-23 23:12:30

I also ask for it neatly sliced, but I am told they only shred it here. Uh oh. Everything was going so well. This is a bad sign: at MINIMUM a BBQ place should slice from the brisket to order. If the person carving has some sort of skill, you won't lose much time. But even it takes longer, who cares? What are you in it for? Money, or serving good food?

Out comes a decent sammich. Bread was a burger bun and impeccable. As it should be. There are tons of sauces, too many actually. We're talking about at least 12. 

The cut of meat is amazing, the brisket is great buuuut... slightly over smoked. Not terribly over smoked, but just slightly. Oversmoking the brisket gives it that super salty taste. There's also an immense amount this weird clear watery grease that prevailed in my friends' lean sandwich. And I mean immense. Puddle on the wax paper plate immense. This suggests it was held in a heater for a bit instead of taken off the cut and served to us. Which is a sin. It was probably sliced and held for a few hours. I know that BBQ is hard to serve fresh during the not-so-busy times, but there is no excuse for serving it out of a heater during a lunch rush. I wouldn't mind waiting a few more minutes to get a fresh cut...and I doubt many Calgarians would mind either. Actually, Calgarians would because most do not know what good food is.  

I tried the chili, which was great although it lacked spice. I paid $2.50 and got a little urine sample sized cup. I found the portion size hilarious but I forgot that I'm presently in west scandinavia. 

It is obvious that the owners here have been to BBQ places down South and they are trying to bring that quality up here. They got some ways to go, but they got 80% of it down. I will return without doubt, and I look forward to this place moving into a building more suited for a BBQ establishment. Like a shack in a parking lot near a church in an industrial park. Ahhhhh Texas.....

I suspect (sadly) that this is the kind of place that would cook a brisket 3/4 and store it so that way they can quickly smoke another one instead of turning customers away because there is no food left. 

By TX standards this is a 2 star BBQ place, but by Canadian standards it is for sure a 4-5 star.",2011-10-29 09:01:44

I bought about 40 lbs of produce for around $20 the other day! Jaw-dropping for me since I come from Hawaii where that same produce would run in the range of $50-$60.

I'm quite preoccupied with my hair lately and I was going through some issues and bad feelings due to a not so great hair coloring experience I had at another salon that left my hair looking ill-bleached orangey and extremely frizzy and dry, so I decided to cut that shit off. 

 I showed Hiroki some pictures of what styles intrigued me and right away he asked me about my colour and how I was feeling about it in his polite Japanese way.  I didn't even have to explain how traumatized I was about my bad color job, it's like he knew why I was there and what needed to be done and he got to work cutting artfully like the pro that he is. 

Admittedly I was a little miffed that my hair was cut a little too short but can I tell you, it's been 3 weeks since the cut and my hair is perfect!!! like almost exactly the same as the pictures I showed Hiroki and even better yet it's soooo low maintenance  I just wash and go (maybe add a little texturing product) and I couldn't be happier.

I have to mention I've noticed a few yelpers complaining about the price for his haircuts, I personally think it's well worth it!  If you were to continue 5 minutes north of N15 towards  Yorkville you can easily expect to pay $150 ish for a similar haircut experience, I paid $70 so yeah I'm pretty stoked about it.

This is my 3rd haircut at N15 and I'm happy to say I won't hesitate to come back for Hiroki's and N15's wonderful hair services.",2017-09-21 02:07:56

I am never disappointed when I go here because they are quick making your food and they have more of a variety to choose from. For instance, they have tacos and not just chicken or steak but shrimp or fish. Not only that but you can make it into a Zaba bowl. A Zaba bowl is your choice of meat with white or brown rice, beans (pinto or black), salsa (mild, medium or hot), sour cream, cheese and lettuce. Sounds a lot like a bowl at Chipotle, which yes they are very similar but Zaba's has more to choose from which is a plus. 
The prices are cheap ranging from a $1 something to $7 something.

The last time we went here, we weren't a couple yet, and we were here with two friends checking out a favorite lounge band of mine ""650."" Some toothless older man (who was probably drunk) asked one of our friends to dance, which caused some uncomfortable silence later on, is all I am gonna say- it's kind of a long story. He did mutter in a southern accent- almost hillbilly,  ""You made me a sad white boy."" That is one of the memories associated with this casino. It's funny now, but at the time, of course, it was weird. The lounge was very small, but there was a dance floor. And we did get down a few times. Miss that band/group.

Most places' menus are heavy on the rolls (sauced up and fried usually) but Sakana has loads of options, many nigiri sushi to choose from and tons of apps. We didn't even put a dent in the menu! There's so much I wanted to try but was too full to get to. Next time!

The service was quick even though the place was packed. There was a short wait for a table but not bad. Dinner was $25.95 and if you can eat at least two rolls on your own (I mean who can't?) then the AYCE option is worth the price.

Awesome rice to fish ratio--I know that's important, esp cheap asses like me who want to get their money's worth (even though my dining companion treated me LOL). They do only allow one order of each for certain items, namely uni, amaebi, oyster, and salmon belly (I think). The uni was hit or miss. A couple pieces were really nice and sweet. The others not so much. Also the fried heads of the amaebi had too thick of batter and the head itself didn't taste so fresh (again, one was good, the other not).

The hamachikama (collar) was tiny and kinda fishy. Not what I'm used to. But there were plenty of items that were great and we got multiples of. The unagi was one of my faves. 

The staff are very attentive since they want a fast turn over rate. They don't make you sit there and digest your food so you can eat less. They just let you order how ever much you want, and clear plates quickly. And as soon as your table is starting to get bare, they come and take another order.

Are there more authentic and higher quality places in town? Sure. But for the price, this is probably as good as you are going to get.",2017-08-09 16:39:56

While I would say the waffle was good - soft waffle, delicious ice cream - and the portion was sufficiently large, I have to admit I was slightly underwhelmed. I guess I was expecting the ice cream to have a stronger coffee flavour, so I was a little disappointed that it didn't. It tasted more like caramel. Also I thought the brownie chunks were too hard and dry, and would have preferred for them to be softer. 

However, overall I would say it was pretty decent dessert, although kind of overpriced (like $13 for a waffle?) and over commercialized.

NUZotiDStKom6O2qS8fRig,x-Gbs8sVid3yhJIoHD6Gfw,fh-hCT2esNJEocdBdggWoQ,3,6,0,0,"Came to QJD for dinner, located inside the Courtyard Marriott hotel. Parking outside is usually full, so best to park in the covered lot accessible from the back. No need to pay, just go in through the hotel and give your license plate number to one of the staff inside the restaurant.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the ambiance is that of a high-end Chinese restaurant. The staff is friendly and generally attentive. The food is pretty decent, however, at this price point, I was expecting better.

We ordered the QJD premium roast duck set ($88), the signature crispy pigeon fish with sweet and sour sauce ($49), Chinese broccoli with ginger sauce ($16), and for dessert the duckling-shaped crispy puff stuffed with date paste ($22 for 6 pcs).

The roast duck is quite good, with the meat being very tender and not overly fatty. However, I prefer my roast duck skin to be more crispy. The pancakes were made extremely thin, allowing the taste of the duck meat to shine through without being masked by the wrap. But the duck here is so much more expensive than other places serving similar Peking-style duck, and it's not much better. 

The crispy fish was very tender and delicious. They even made it look like a squirrel, which was very cute. However, at almost $50 for this super tiny fish, it really wasn't worth it. And being deep fried and smothered in s&s sauce, a cheap tilapia would have tasted just as good as this special pigeon fish.

The duck-shaped puff with date paste was again cute, but a little dry. At this price, I can buy out the entire tray of date pastries at the local Chinese bakery store and still have enough money left for half a dozen egg tarts!

The food here is decent but far too overpriced for what you get. What really irritated me is seeing that they charge for extra sauce, scallions, and cucumber strips ($1.39 each). After charging $88 for the duck, is it really necessary to nickel and dime customers over a little extra sauce? What's worse is, the scallions were all dried out and not even fresh. I wouldn't request more even if it were free, like at every other restaurant!

This place was good to try once, but at this price point, there are so many better restaurants. Unlikely I'll return again.",2018-02-25 02:34:16

I have just been there again at the new woodbine location and would like to write a review now that I am a ""yelper"" too. I guess this review here is really to reconfirm again their sushi is still as good as before, even after they have moved recently. It's true that the menu has changed alot in the new place and the many a la Carte that many used to enjoyed are no longer being offered. But for me, I always go to Zen for Sushi only so this change doesn't impact me at all (I am sure it may have to other customers).

For the Omakase Sushi menu, they offered two pricing menus, $65 and $85. With $85, you get extra fish soup (or other soup the kitchen may offer for the day), appetizer, and dessert. I think it's well worth the extra $20 to get those extra 3 items. I have tried the Omakase twice ($85) since they moved to this new location and the Sushi being served is great! I would always prefer eating at the Sushi bar because the experience is also different, for example, the seaweed is still crunchy when the piece of sushi is served on your plate and eat it immediately ... it's minor in details but it can make a difference at times. 

-- edited: section removed as a reviewer corrected me on type of fish, thx for the correction! :) --

But you don't have to pick the Omakase menu if you don't want to and you can always order the sushi separately and they will charge you the sushi by order. But for me, I just pick the Omakase so I dont need to do any thinking in picking what I want.

This isn't some one night five star fling review ;) Soul consistently delivers when it comes to food and drink.

Soul is a cozy, hip restaurant that has an upstairs entrance. It also boasts a patio (that's heated during the winter months) which provides an abbreviated view of the skyline. They have a beautiful bar that's pretty much the centerpiece of the space. Ladies: there's an added bonus for bar seating. They have purse hooks!! As for restaurant seating? well...I'm not lying when I say it's cozy. There are about two-three booths and then rest of the seating consists of tables that can be grouped together or broken a part for two person seating. Trust me, you'll be so focused enjoying every bite of your food that you won't be worried about your proximity to your neighbor(s).

Back to the bar....the bartenders make THE BEST DRINKS. I've enjoyed their  summer version of the moscow mule which includes cucumber - yum - and their winter version called the winter's mule. The winter's mule is hands down my favorite drink and I was that person sucking down every last drop of the drink through her straw.

As for the food....there is so much to say. The place covers Asian, Greek, Spanish, American cuisines with such understated flair and sophistication. Clearly there's a reason why the pork belly tacos are so well-documented because THEY ARE DELICIOUS. Simply put, you absolutely must get those if/when you go there. It's like a rule. Every time I've been to Soul, I always get a sushi roll of some sort. They are very creative with the flavors and I'm always pleased. 

Soul does not have a designated parking lot. Don't even bother thinking about parking in the CVS lot because they will either tow your car or yell at you when you walk back to your car (mentioning this from past experience). If you're lucky, grab a spot in the lot that's across Pizza Peel/The Dish and walk over or park in the Bistro La Bon/Healthy Home Market lot. Also, don't even think about not having to wait on a weekend night.

Racks upon racks of clothes for women, men & children, multiple display cases of jewelry, floor lined with shoes, shelves of purses & shelves of kitchen items.

We sat for couple hours enjoying every meal that they served us, oh boy it was good! Our table favorite were some sort of sautéed green collard in hoisin sauce, shrimp dumplings in clear rice flour wrap and bean curd dumplings. Our least favorite we're the sticky rice rolled sushi like with bean, it was mushy. The chicken wings were OK, but otherwise everything were good!

I wish they had the Chinese music during the new year to bring the festivities more fun.

They also make very good lobsters as well.  Is about $16 per pound and unlike other places, when you order a 5lb one, you actually do get all of the pieces.

The fried rice dishes are fried very well cooked too.  I like them dry and if the rice are individually separated,  you know it is good stuff. 

They usually start you off with a complimentary soup with a side of the meat that was cooked in the brooth (yummy) and end the meal with a warm bowl of tofu fa.

""Meh, I've experienced better"" is a perfect description of Sunday night's meal.  Firstly there were a lot of children hovering around the bar.  That's a turn off for this singleton.

But I digress.  The meats were not that great.  All of the beef options were very fatty.  After about an hour in we had to actually request to have some of the meats sent over b/c they had not made it to our table yet.  I repeat after an HOUR.

The salad bar was also just meh.  Not impressive at.all.  I've previously been to Texas De Brazil and the salad bar was miles and miles above Chima.  

So - at the end of the day the ambiance was not great (see grubby kids running around, I felt like I was at a Ponderosa) and neither was the food.  I don't know if that's b/c it was restaurant week and they 'cheaped' it down a bit.  Regardless I will NOT be back.",2014-01-21 23:39:22

He said he had to check with the chef.  He comes back and says it is 60% lobster and 40% crab.  Huh?  He did not seem to think there was anything wrong with that.  He acted like that was okay to do.  It says ""lobster"" on the menu, so it should be 100% lobster.  I am convinced it was the fake stuff too.  Overall, the food was below average,  and the service was even worse.

Boyfriend ordered their $10 plus cobb salad with Blue cheese dressing on the side.  After he poured the dressing on the salad and tasted it, he realized it wasn't blue cheese (tasted like rancid ranch) so we sent it back.  The manager brought back the new salad and asked again what happened to the first and after repeating it, he actually didn't say much about it.  Now we realize the new $10+ salad didn't have any chicken on it so we told our waitress when she finally got around to checking on us.  She chuckled at the fact that the manager didn't catch this oversight.  The manager finally comes around with a cup of cubed chicken (don't know why it took as long as it did when the chicken, I'm sure, is pre-cooked and premeasured) and before he places it down on the table, he gives the salad a once over, as if to make sure that it, in fact, didn't have any chicken in it.  Meanwhile, the rest of us are done with our dinner.

I worked at this location some 15+ years ago as a bartender and server.  Back then, if a customer didn't like what they ordered and ESPECIALLY if the order came out with something wrong with it, we were trained to happily replace the meal AND comp it.  NOT ANYMORE.  NO comped drinks, no offer of free dessert and more importantly, not even an apology!

K8PngUrn3AYeaUr7IZHF2g,4xgbVGM9yklvk8zrOf7tiA,mfQfNIb3TYeBSxsN1WD8eA,1,1,0,0,"Classiest McDonald's restaurant I've ever visited with the most classless management.

I came in and ordered my burger the same way I always do... ""ketchup and cheese only."" I've been ordering that way since I was a child and I'm now feeling old AF. It's practically motor memory now to speak my order exactly like so. 

The food came quick. It was like lightning. I give them that much. In the short minute I waited for my food, I couldn't help but acknowledge this is the nicest, most presentable McDonald's I've ever been to. I was notably impressed with their clean, neat look. My food arrived and I sat myself down. I opened my burger for an accuracy check to see immediately it was not made as ordered. My receipt showed it was not due to the food prep staff, it was an order taking error. The cashier was polite at least... just incorrect. No big deal.

My problem lies in what seemed to be their manager/supervisor on duty. A short woman with short hair and a tie. I can only assume she was the manager because she was the only one I noticed with a tie on. I caught her in a free moment and politely pulled her to the side to whisper how my burger was made incorrectly so no attention was drawn to the guests in line. She took it from me after I explained my order and walked away. No ""sorry about that,"" no ""we'll fix it,"" no anything. Just grabbed it and walked away with what appeared to be an annoyed eye roll. 

Where my problem had escalated was that I (no exaggeration) waited 6-8 minutes for them to remake a burger they originally made in 1 minute. I watched a number of those people who were waiting in line not only place their orders but receive them with in that time. Which shows me their priority was not in retaining guests so much as immediate profit generating. I stood at a counter where she passed me by several time to serve others with a tray full of fries that had gotten warm at that point before she finally retrieved my burger. 

Icing on the cake moment... she handed me the burger as I simultaneously thanked her loud enough for her to hear and walked off. No ""you're welcome,"" no ""thank you for your patience,"" no ""sorry for the wait"" no apology of ANY KIND for that matter. No words again. She just walked off. 

It's one thing to see an employee with poor service etiquette as a front facing representative of your business, but to see that poor service extends to your management team is a problem of concern. I really hope a manager reads this and reevaluates who is leading their team, what examples they are setting for their front line staff to follow, and how they are being received by their guests. Even as I am writing this review, the right column highlights two 2-star reviews, and two 1-star reviews. What they are doing is clearly not working the way it should be and this could have easily been the most impressive McDonald's I've ever been to in my life had it not been for the way their staff is trained.

Ronald McDonald would not stand for this, and he is a clown. Neither should this head management team.",2017-06-07 23:22:03

You are a restaurant that I think about when I want a restaurant with an atmosphere and view of Camelback Mountain. And with your bar and indoor/outdoor seating arrangements, you are the perfect place to enjoy a meal on a warm or cool day.

I've dined at BLT twice and I think I will be setting up a sleeping bag and just living there from now on. Most recently, I went last night for my birthday. When asked to pick my restaurant poison for the unbirthday celebration, I didn't have to think twice before saying BLT. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was full with people but not overly crowded. Our table was ready upon arrival and situated just by the patio and overlooking the mountains so a perfect mixture of indoor outdoor seating. The service was a bit on the slow side but I enjoyed that since this was a leisurely dinner and not one you want to get rushed. The waiter definitely gave us our time. After beginning with wine (a must at a Steakhouse of course), we were served my very favorite classic starter -- popovers! They were large in charge and full of buttery taste. I could probably go back for the popovers alone. For the meal, my table chose between the classic steak and the sole. I went with the sole and to insert much needed awful puns here...I felt the soul train after just one bite! How do I describe it. Upon taking a bite, I tasted candied pecan. As random as it sounds, it tasted delicious. It was a good amount of sole and due to the heaviness of the sauce (delicious sauce by the way), I couldn't finish it as much as I tried. I know I'll be dreaming about the sole for years to come. Plus, since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$, I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have! 

Moving on to dessert, we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty. I ordered an apple crisp tart and it was ok, but the entree was definitely the highlight of the evening. The only awkward moment of the night was that since it was my birthday, my table apparently tried to tell the staff three times and put the note on the reservation. But, alas three reminders later, still no birthday candle on a dessert (which was fine by me since I like to avoid the birthday if at all possible but my table wouldn't let it slide.) Finally after one final awkward reminder, just as we were ready to go and plates had practically been cleared, a random chocolate souffle appeared with happy birthday. Still no candle and the moment was kind of over but the thought still counts. So I'd probably say this was a great birthday spot for me since I don't enjoy the birthday candle as much, but if you visit and that's important to you, you may want to get on that as early in the dinner as possible! 

Now that I am officially full for the weekend, I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion.

These were whole orders so I tried to pace myself. I finished those swiftly because they were delicious! I also ordered a Beef Lettuce Wrap ..that was okay but it fell apart. It was hard to eat it because it was broken but I found a way. Then I ordered the Deep Fried Lobster Rolls at first I wasn't sure if I could eat it because they were big. They tasted funny in the beginning but the more I ate them the better tasting they became because of the spicy sauce. I had two types of rolls and I was getting full...so I thought I will start just getting appetizers. I started with the Crab Rangoon the filling was nice and sweet. Then I ordered an egg roll that I didn't like. It's pretty hard to find an egg roll that would rival my moms so I don't know why I try. My plan was working so far... so I ordered the Shrimp Tempura .

The music was loud, but it wasn't too festive, and I think it was coming from the tvs instead of a live band, since I never saw a band there that day.  The margarita deserves 5 stars.  Outstanding!

It has huge pretzel squares that were too big to even fit half in your mouth. THey're so worth all the carbs. And I loved that the salt didn't come off when you picked them up.

So it is a jewelry store our front, lol, which confused me as the door to the restaurant is somewhat disguised like a hidden door. But once you get in, there is no mistaking it. 

A warning now: if you wanted a private, intimate dinner, go somewhere else. B&E is crazy loud. Reminds me of being in a club at South Beach. You will have to lean in and yell to have conversation. Definitely a lot of energy.

Normally this is not my cup of tea, but I can make exceptions for extraordinary food. The menu is setup for sharing with small plates, so for 2 people we had 5 plates. Wagyu sliders, tomato soup and cheese pot stickers, pork belly, lamb chops, and a lamb Bolognese pasta.

Each and every plate was amazing. I really didn't think it would be, but they were all perfect. Each of them were very unique, and we felt they all hit the spot.

For dessert, we had the carrot cake and smores. Both also good, but perhaps not as unique or creative.

It's too big to be a pub, and although there are plenty of tvs, not everyone is there to watch sports. It's more of a loud, crowded hangout spot.

Jacks is located on 7th St., between Hawthorne's Pizza and Philosopher's Stone. 

The first thing I noticed when I entered was that there are many different sections to the interior. 

There is a dining room to the right where I've seen karaoke happening, a large bar area straight ahead, a game area with pool tables and mini-shuffleboard to the right, with another dining area linked to that.
I was initially a bit confused trying to take it all in and figure out where to go.

There is also a fairly spacious patio outside, which is great in warm weather and when the inside is crowded and smoky.

I've never eaten here, so I can't speak to the quality of the food. 
The beer is nice and cold though, so that's generally good enough for me.

Popped in for a late lunch constituting of an Alsatian onion tart and a glass of wine.  I stopped by during happy hour, which meant the tart was $7 (orig. $9), and $2 off glasses of wine.  Bartender Jimmy was kind enough to give me samples of two reds and a rose, before I decided on a Riesling, instead.  Enjoyed the generous pour, which was later added to when Jimmy accidently knocked the decanter down when we shook hands :)  The tart came out a little burnt, and the gruyere was replaced with a milder ""fromage blanc,"" but overall, it still made for a very tasty lunch/dinner!  Photos will prove that I ate at least 5.5 slices.  Read my lips: I ATE THE WHOLE THING.

Happy hour apps menu include onion soup gratin, country pate, escargots, onion tart, and a frisee salad for about $2 less than standard menu.  $5 IPAs, $3 off wine cocktails (reg. $10), and $2 off glasses of wine.  (I'm sure there are discounts on drafts and bottles, too, but since I'm not a beer-drinker, I didn't make a special note of this.)  I hope more food will be added to the menu.  Sad news: the toffee sticky pudding has been omitted from the current menu, with no hope of it coming back again.  (Strange that, since Jimmy said it was a very popular dessert.)  The crowd this Monday afternoon was very thin (4:00'ish)- a couple of tables outside, and me at the bar.  A man sat at a table behind me waiting for his date, and another man who recently relocated from San Fran sat a couple of seats from me later on.  Looks like a decent wine list.

The dim lights reminded me of a favorite lounge/bar in Kansas City that I loved. I finally was able to go here last night with my fiance and another couple and had a great time. 

We found a parking spot really easy on the west side, same parking lot at Starbucks and Pei Wei. The front door is actually on the 7th street side so I was a bit bummed I didn't get to go up that fire escape staircase. It reminded me of something out of a big city but the wooden stairs inside, up to the bar did the trick.

When we got upstairs about 9:30 on a Friday night, there weren't too many people there but it wasn't dead either. We didn't notice any waitresses or any other staff, just two bartenders. Both saw us walk in, neither of them greeted us. We tried taking a seat at the hightop near the bar. The seats were a bit uncomfy so we opted to move toward the front in the lower white chairs around a small table. Much better. We sent one person up to grab menu's since none were on the table. We all ordered something different, I personally had to try the White Rabbit after the rave reviews and it definitely was yummy. Really yummy! Everyone enjoyed their drinks. And on top of that, I thought the prices were super reasonable for a place like this. I think mine was $8 and they all stayed about that price range. We ordered two different rounds, each time having to make it up to the bar to order. Neither bartender smiled but did ask us about our evening so maybe they were just a bit grumpy? I guess maybe not everyone is a 'smiler' but it would have gone a long way. Service was fast and accurate. The drink pours are pretty strong so I felt a little uneasy about balancing our two drinks back to the table for the second round. Are there typically no waitresses here? I'd gladly tip one generously to not have to make that trip every time I want a drink and have to leave my peeps and our conversation. It was a bit warm and the faux leather chairs were pretty hot but the rest of the place was as great as advertised. Fantastic music, great art, great lighting and a great vibe overall. The place wasn't overly loud so you could actually talk to your friends without screaming, which is a rarity in a bar. I did make a visit to the restroom and its a great bathroom! Clean, modern, big and they even had nice toilet paper! How often do you see that at a bar??!? Happy camper here! Just before leaving at 11:30, one of the bartenders came over to clear our table of empty glasses. Looking around, I noticed everyone tables were jam packed with empties. They could definitely use a person to bus the tables.

I saw 4 stars on Yelp for this joint and was looking forward to a great meal, but unfortunately Perch did not deliver.

I came here with some friends and both of my friends had steak with salad and steak with fries. I had the poached egg bib salad with chicken. 

I told the waitress to take off 2 things from the salad and I knew very well that there was no mention of any onions on the menu.

Well to my surprise when I got my salad there where onions on it. Unfortunately I can not eat onions, because I am allergic.

This ordeal would have been avoided if the menus were up to date. 

In a nutshell I asked the waitress if she could have the salad remade and she did, but having to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to get my food was not fun.

In all honesty it would have been great if at least half of my salad would have been taken off my bill. 

This was a pretty obvious slip up for a place that supposedly offers 4 star food and service. 

And another bad move on behalf of the staff is when I asked about the Riesling I was told that it was sweet when it was actually dry. In all honesty how can you not know your wines?

This was not what I expected from Perch and at this point if I come back it'll be a while.

There are a few important details that Perch has to work on before I could truly consider them a true 4 star joint.

Always happy to see a chef preaching the ethics of local-seasonal sourcing and scratch-made-to-order cooking, particularly in the breakfast scene, it was unfortunately a rocky start for myself and MTO Café as even before they opened for business a steady trickle of shady ""Five Star"" reviews began to fill the internet, a trend not uncommon but nonetheless off-putting and causing me pause until more respectable voices were heard...in this case 3 months later.  Open seven days a week from breakfast till lunch and already a downtown darling with critics, city hall, and Zappos affiliates it was on a lazy Sunday that a friend and I sat down to a table in the airy, charming space just after 8:15 and with on-point service highly praiseful of both Chef Church and owner Ben Sabouri's vision much of what followed would prove well worth the hyperbole, a total of seven items and nearly as many cups of coffee comprising our 90 minute stay.  A menu broad in sections yet well-culled in scope it was with a wide swath that we cut through the options and requesting that items be sent out individually as the kitchen felt fit it was from sweet to savory that the morning progressed, an early offering of doughnuts that came off a touch oily and the doughy bread of the 'Fat Elvis' minor disappointments more than offset by fluffy vegan pancakes, creamy brie on lightly sweetened brioche, and superlative proteins such as the fried chicken smothered in béchamel or the tender turkey burger atop savory bread pudding alongside signature ""mashed browns,"" a crunchy/creamy juxtaposition of butter, brine, and starch.  Off to a good start and informed by our server that the new menu is scheduled to debut in just a few weeks I look forward to seeing how MTO evolves over time - early marketing tactics aside this is a spot with 'destination breakfast' potential and along with 'eat' already a reason for suburbanites and tourists to make their way downtown before dusk.",2014-01-21 06:01:03

To start, they brought bread and butter. One of the best I have had in town, we ate it so quickly that they brought us more. Then we had the ahi tuna. It was delicious and the mustard on top complimented the dish perfectly. For the main meal we had the Colorado Lamb Rack and the Brick Roasted Chicken with a side order of the smoked Gouda mac and cheese.

I suppose they may have been waiting for enough snow to melt to fill up my water glass.  

Anyhow, once our orders were placed there was mass confusion.  None of the orders came out together.  People got wrong items or items were missing all together.  I guess having 3-4 people waiting on a table of 10-15 is just not enough???

I've shopped here several times in the last month and am very happy with my purchases and experiences. 

The staff at A&P is so knowledgeable and obviously very passionate about all things plants. The advice I received was perfect for this wanna-be backyard farmer trying to get her garden off the ground (literally). They recommended specific soil that's formulated for raised garden beds and gave me a few options at different price points. Once I mentioned that I would be making a few trips to take home all the bags of soil (my little sedan can only hold so much soil in the trunk), the guy (I think his name is Johnny?) asked how far away I lived. He immediately offered to load the soil into his pickup truck, follow me home, and unload it into my backyard. Um, YES?! Are you kidding me?! I would never receive an offer like that from a manager at Lowe's or Home Depot.

As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.

When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, ""I have to go back for the rest.""  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  

During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!

My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.

I was greeted cheerfully when I walked in and was seated immediately. Within a minute I had a menu, a glass of water and a single ragoon on a plate with sauce.

Looking over the menu I decided on the Stir Fried Broccoli.  With each meal you get your choice of chicken, pork, tofu, beef, duck or shrimp. I originally was going to go with the duck but since they were out of that on this particular day I went with the beef.  I was also asked to what degree of spiciness I would like and I went with an 8 on a 1 to 10 scale. 

The meal was in front of me within five minutes. The rice came molded into a heart-shape which I thought was a nice touch. The broccoli and carrots were good and crunchy (not soft and overcooked), the brown sauce had a very good kick to it but sadly the meat was awful! It was all tough and gristly making me wish that they had the duck available or that I would have chosen chicken instead.   

My bill came to a little over $10. The service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and this place has a lot going for it... but it's not even close to being the quality of Nicky's Thai Kitchen on Penn. I give it a 3 star mainly due to the meat.",2015-03-05 18:32:15

This place is located on Blue Diamond Road not too far from highway 15 so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself is somewhat large, and doesn't get too busy so no problem to get a table.

We decided to take the ultimate burger and the pulled chicken burger along with a cup of chili, fries and rice, and a brownie. The ultimate burger was very good, while the pulled chicken burger was a little less so. Service was pretty fast and we ended up paying $23 for all this food.

Cafe Sanuki has definitely stolen our heart as one of Vegas's best fresh made udon restaurant. Portions are big and prices are very reasonable. This very nicely decorated, spacious, clean restaurant is conveniently located on Spring Mt and Decatur facing Decatur. There are plenty of parking out front but if that lot gets full there is plenty more to the side since it is located in the same plaza as the bigger SF Market. 

As you walk into the restaurant you will see a really nice display of all the yummy looking dishes they have to offer made out of plastic in a big glass display case. Even tho it is fake it still looked very delicious haha You are then greeted by their very nice hostesses who will tell you how you order. The whole kitchen where the udon is made fresh and everything is prepared is in a large open spaced kitchen for you to see. It's awesome! My kids absolutely love seeing the chefs load the udon making machine and boiling the noodles fresh right before their eyes. 

So to the right after you walk in is the Start here line. Line is shaped as U as it follows the kitchen to the cashier. First you grab your tray then decide what you want to order. The nice clean pictured menu is given to you at the door as well as displayed on big screens right above you. If the line is long enjoy the view of your udon being freshly made before your eyes if not you'll walk right up to the cooks as they take your order. Everything came out really fast. If it is not ready they will give you a stand with your number on it and bring it to your table when it's ready. After you order you will see a huge display of delicious tempura under a heating lamp for you to choose from. Grab a plate and pick whichever your heart desires. Right after the tempura are the rice rolls and finally the cashier. Check in on Yelp to get a free drink!

After you pay on the way to their spacious seat yourself dining area you will pass their beverage station. Hands down this is the beverage station of all beverage stations! Haha Here they have the Coke Freestyle fountain Machine with 144 flavors. But seriously forget about the soda machine because their house made lemonade and fresh brewed teas are amazingly refreshing! They also offer flavor pumps you could add to your tea if needed. Did I mention that it's BOTTOMLESS for only $2.25!?! LOVE THIS! ..don't forget to grab your utensils and tempura sauce located next to the soda fountain. 

Let's get to their yummy udon dishes..

Kake Udon - udon are perfectly made. Broth is nice and light. Kids loved it

Niku Udon - loaded with thin slices of meat. Taste and portion is good

Seafood Tomato Cream - A definite must order if you like seafood. Served in a huge bowl the portion was big. Flavor was a perfectly seasoned tomato cream base with big chunks of squid, fish fillets, shrimp, and de-shelled mussels. Like this was loaded with seafood. Not just one piece of each item but maybe 3-4 of each!

Mentai Cream Udon - delicious! Probably my favorite so far right next to the Seafood Tomato Cream. Portion is good as well being served in the big black bowl they have. I need to know where they get that big bowl from. I love it lol

Shrimp Tempura with tempura sauce - perfectly fried. Light and crispy and not heavily greasy. 

Spam Rice Roll - Very neatly packaged. It tells you to pull on the red tab which will then rip off the wrapper. Rice, a slice of spam, and sauce. Taste like a spam musubi but with way less rice. Good little snack

Overall we love this place and recommend it to everyone. We will definitely be back again soon to try the rest of their delicious looking menu! I am eyeing that miso garlic pork belly bowl. Didn't know I could add a mini rice bowl to try for only $2.50! Great deal. You could also add more noodles to the first 9 numbered bowls for only $2. See you soon Cafe Sanuki! Enjoy everyone",2017-11-20 03:22:45

Cafe de Japon is a very Nippon atmosphere, just like Philip T mentioned in his review.  Perhaps because the ladies working in the front are both Japanese, the outfits they wore, and even how the dishes are presented and served all reminded me of my previous visits to Tokyo. It reminds me of those small mom-and-pop type restaurants, that you randomly find wandering around the ""suburbs"" of Tokyo just a few blocks from the subway stations, serving up their menu of specialties.  Its only missing the salary men and the office ladies with their elegant heels

The simple menu here is very close to what I would want to serve if I did open up my own small restaurant... curries, katsu, and other traditional Japanese comfort food/family staples. So I am glad an established chef had similar idea and implement it.

Anyway, I had a half order of the Chef's Salad, which was simple but delicious. The creamy salad dressing had a nice peppery taste.  I also ordered the Hayashi Rice (beef and onion stew with a rich demi-glace and tomato sauce taste, which is a popular ""Western-style"" dish served in Japan).  This particular version does not have mushrooms, which would make it that much more awesome, but is still very good.

I passed on the siphon coffee, even thought I was eyeing them wrapping the individual glasses up to put in the walk-in cooler.  I blame Joe Biden's visit to City Center tomorrow, for having to be at work extra early at 1am, so the secret service details can perform their security protocols.

The pudding of the day also looks good.  And they have a Yuzu soda that sounds interesting.

Definitely have to come back to try more!

Note: no refills on the beverages, except iced water.  And the are closed on Sundays.  Be sure to check out their specials of the days too.

Food:  4/5  Good flavor, sensible portions, nice traditional presentations.

Price:  3/5  Will not break the bank, but thought it was priced higher than expected for this type of food (relative to LA's JTown, Gardena & Torrance - all significant Japanese American population centers in SoCal)

Location:  5/5  On Spring Mountain (between Decatur and Lindell), so fairly centrally located for most.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  Nice elegant feel, love the marbled countertop seats and the selection of JPOP.

Parking:  5/5 Never had problem finding parking here, and they have spaces reserved for their guests right outside their door.

The #1 reason I like this mall a lot is because the Target is actually inside of the mall. With Ross Park, the nearest Target is in a separate shopping plaza a couple of miles down the road. Also, this mall has a Dick's Sporting goods store inside of the mall too,which was particularly convenient this past weekend when I needed to get ski pants in addition to leggings (purchased at Forever 21) so I never had to leave the mall to get both. They have my typical go to store, Forever 21, however I did not see an H&M so I still think Ross Park has the leg up on that one. Otherwise they seem to have all of the staples-American Eagle, Victoria's Secret, J. Crew, Ann Taylor, etc. They have the anchors Macy's and JCP too. They have less of the upscale stores that Ross Park has, however, as I noted in my review of Ross Park, I rarely see anyone in those ""upscale"" stores. I'll still come back here but really only because it is convenient to my boyfriend's house.

I can't even describe what was on the rest of the menu because one read of the description of the Churrasco had me sold and I didn't bother to look at anything else. Naturally-raised steak, tomatoes, avocado, mayo, red pepper sauce and Completo's home-made hot sauce, all served on a warm bun. As mouth-watering as it sounds! The steak was plentiful, the toasted bun was crispy and hot and the combination of the three sauces not only tasted heavenly, but didn't produce a soggy or messy texture at all.

 At $9 (tax included!), the sandwich was a steal, and as filling, healthy and nutritionally balanced as it was good value.

The staff were amazing, very friendly and welcoming, and they truly made an effort to get to know me. Their friendliness was EXTRA appreciated when I got home and realised that I had actually sauntered into Completo and casually ordered a sandwich to eat-in just three minutes before they were due to close! I had no idea I had done this until I checked their hours online afterwards. Oops! The guys could not have been nicer and more welcoming if they tried even though they were probably secretly cursing my arrival, wanting to get home.

For those unfamiliar with this joint, there's a limited amount of indoor seating, so take-out is probably the best option for most. The inside however is more than comfortable if you choose to stay; it's clean and has a washroom. The only negative about Completo is that it's cash only, and there are no nearby ATMs that I am aware of. However, the fact that the tax is included in the pricing more than compensates for the cash-only inconvenience.

As for which broth is best, I've only tried two: tonkatsu (pork bone broth) and tonkatsu ""black"". The black version is doused with pungent garlic oil, and definitely has a nice depth of flavour. But my preference is the regular. I may be in the minority on that since others seem to really love the black. Either way, thin noodles are perfect in this soup.

Spicy tan-tan is definitely the next broth I need to try. Sansotei only makes a limited amount of tan-tan daily, and last time I was there they were sold out. Seriously a ramen place selling out of broth? That's some artisan shit right there.

The Outlaw Scramble, man that's a great dish, my eyes were bigger then my tummy so I didn't finish everything, but what I had was so good! The green sauce OMG amazing!!

The call from the service manager came, and he stated that there was a mix up and they did have the part, but that he didn't know why we weren't contacted. Turns out the info sheet we filled out was never added to the computer, so they were trying to contact a phone number we no longer have (from 3 years ago, we found this out when they gave us the paperwork after the service was done).

The service manager suggested we bring the car in in March, since thats when the oil change is due. Why would we do that? We purposely came in in January and had the part ordered. Also, the part controls the heat/ac/defroster, what reasonable person would say, oh no, thats ok, I'll just deal with this for a few more months??

They made an appointment for the next day, and setup a shuttle to pickup my partner to and from work while the car was being fixed. The warranty did cover it, we only had to pay a deductible (which is stipulated in the warranty, so no issue there).

Their menu has changed, they have a special menu with higher end items like Toro, uni, salmon roe, most were 30+.

Since I haven't been here for a while, decided to try some of their popular items.

We got the Osaka fried rice. It was like a rice version of takoyaki. It was really good with all the sauce, pickled ginger, octopus pieces.  

We tried the yakitori combo with 5 skewers. All were really yummy and nice aroma of charcoal BBQ.  In the combo we got a skewer of chicken tail. Very interesting and fatty.  It's very small pieces like chicken hearts. 

Tried a cold started of yakko (cold tofu).  Pretty good and smooth. Onions and ginger adds a nice touch, and you add your own soya sauce. 

Got the friend chicken soft bone, this was freshly made, and very hot inside when we got it. Add a squeeze of lemon, and it has a nice refreshing taste with texture of crunchy and softness (from the batter).  

Lastly we tried the roasted green tea pudding. It was a pretty big portion good for sharing. It didn't have a strong green tea flavour, and more grey in colour.  It wasn't bad, but I couldn't locate the roasted green tea taste.

Problem being--they NEVER heat it long enough. Today I ran out of patience with the soggy crust, congealed cheese and lukewarm topping that this underheating produces. (I'm also pregnant, so wanted to make sure the deli meats on the slice were heated through properly.) So I asked the lady to put it back in the oven for me for a little while. (I was perfectly polite, btw.)

You would have thought I had just asked her if I could take a pee in their sink.

She was SO grudging and rude, shaking her head and mumbling under her breath. Seriously?!? Lady, if you are not prepared to meet a simple, easy request from a customer who doesn't want to get food poisoning from your tepid pizza, you should not be in the business. Go and do something in an industry where you don't ever have to interact with people.

Anyway, once they had put it back in the oven for 2 minutes longer, the pizza was fine. I don't know why they don't just do this in the first place. Is it because they think people are in such a rush they'd rather eat cold, soggy pizza than wait an extra 2 minutes? Or is it because they are trying to sling as many slices in as little time possible? Either way they should have a little more respect for their product, and their customer. I might give it one more try, but if I get the same cold pizza followed by a death stare again, no way Jose.

I think the place has such a high rating bc people are comparing it to Pizza Pizza, which is honest to god the worst, most overpriced pizza in the world. Seriously, saying that this is way better than Pizza Pizza is not saying much at all. If you think Papa Ceo's is the peak of pizza perfection, I feel sorry for you, my friend. It's greasy, cheap pizza--pretty satisfying when it's done right (or you're stoned off your chops), but that's it.

Also taking off a half star because they don't have hot sauce (at least the didn't today). Only thing that makes cold pizza palatable IMO.",2012-08-17 17:54:34

The sushi rolls were delicious and didn't take too long. But I ordered a spicy hibachi chicken dish, which was frankly awful. The chicken was barely sauced and had a rubbery texture, as though cut with the grain from a massive breast then cooked too quickly.  It was missing the mushrooms advertised in the menu description, and although they were delivered separately, a miserly portion.  Live ants marched across the sushi bar as we dined.  When this was pointed out to the manager, she killed one and skittered away without comment.  The trash bins were overflowing in the ladies room, which I pointed out to another manager upon leaving.  Nary a apology. I wrote to Benihana via their website, and received  a personal phone call, and after five minutes of excuses and explanations, no offer to replace the rubber chicken or invite me back for a better experience on the house.

Driving to Tempe Diablo can be difficult.  The freeway often backs up around the Broadway Curve and the surface streets don't all go through.  Take Southern to Potter and go North, then park along Campus Drive.  It is a reasonable walk but you will avoid parking fees and the traffic mess getting out.  Parking is exceptionally bad at this stadium and should really be avoided at all costs.

There isn't much around Tempe Diablo which is reminiscent of the Big A in Anaheim.  Just down the street is a ton of stuff though, so if you can find a way across the freeway, you are set.  The exterior of the stadium is quite impressive and makes you feel like you are at a big league park.  The practice fields are just west of the main stadium and, if you walk through the only parking lot, you can wait for the players to come out and sign.  They usually do if you get there early enough.

Once inside the stadium, you'll find a small amount of grass seating and a wooden wall in right.  Just beyond the wall is the freeway.  It really is like Angel Stadium.  The main seating bowl is not much either.  The seats are crammed and small but they are close to the field.  Almost all of the seats are in the sun with the exception of the top 10 rows behind home plate and toward first base.  The concourse area is shaded but it is narrow and gets very crowded.  You can at least watch the game from it.

The food is pretty disappointing.  There is usually a Salty Sinorita or Dos Gringos-type place that has a stand and that is really the most adventurous food you will find.  Standard fare everywhere else is a bit disappointing.

In all, this stadium was, at the time, a step in the right direction, but has since become outdated by the newer parks.  It is too bad because the location is convenient for most of the Valley and the team is so good.",2009-03-03 18:17:15

1st visit: My wife and I had seen the opening soon sign for several months and had been waiting for it to open. We went to sushi nearby and noticed that it was open on the way back from dinner. We were already full from dinner but figured we'd try some beers. We were disappointed that they didn't have their own brews yet, but the beers we did have were delicious. The light colored coffee beer was unique and the 300 foot Steve was one of the better beers I've had on tap.

2nd visit: We came for lunch this time so we could try some of the food and we noticed a bomb-looking salad on our first visit so we decided to get some salads. I got the peach and prosciutto salad. It was really good and filling enough for lunch. I got the 300 Foot Steve beer Super positive experience overall.

3rd visit: This is really where I was won over. We came for dinner and invited a friend. Finally a restaurant in Surprise I can invite a friend and feel confident in the food and experience. We started with poutine and it was as horribly-amazing as poutine is supposed to be. My wife and I shared the diavola pizza and our friend ordered the peanut butter and jelly burger (you read that correctly). The pizza was probably in the top 5 pizzas I've had in the last year, but you really need to like spicy food to enjoy. The real star was the PBJ burger. My wife and I both tried a bite, and my god is that thing some unholy pact with the devil. By all rights it shouldn't be good, but it really, really was.

4th visit: This time was all beer all the time. I tried the freak'n raspberry, 300 ft steve (again bc it's that good), Sun-up Amber, and an IPA I can't remember the name. The raspberry was good, but not as sour as I would have liked for a beer in that category. Sun-up Amber was the weakest of the bunch. IPA was solid

Overall after 4 visits, the service was always prompt and friendly. The food was always excellent and inventive. This is the restaurant that my wife and I have wished was in Surprise since we moved here 7 years ago. We will be returning often and are so happy that it's here.

TL;DR - Go here try awesome food, drink awesome beer, be surprised it's in surprise.",2016-08-14 02:57:07

We were disappointed with the waitress who kept peeking out of kitchen while on her phone. Oddly too she never greeted us. We ordered our food through the bartender, he told her our order and she asked him if we wanted drinks, he said he didn't know. She never ever came, introduced herself or asked. We had to stop her and ask for drinks. 

The place wasn't busy, she had one other table. So, we weren't off to a great start. Our order arrived and we asked about our avocado (supposed to be on the side) but wasn't present. She said the kitchen forgot to do it. She forgot to mention she forgot to check that our order was correct prior to bringing it to us. We then had to ask for salt, pepper and ketchup, which she then brought. 

The rest of our meal was uneventful and the sand which was as good as promised. 

I needed to use the restroom prior to our leaving and was hit immediately with a foul bathroom! Foul, as in the sewer backed up at some point earlier in the day. So I promptly lost the food I just ate. I came running out of the bathroom still heaving. My husband asked if there was a sewer problem, the bar tender said yes. 

Let me be clear- if your bathrooms are THAT BAD YOU SHOULD HAVE A SIGN UP!! Any business that serves food and then reclaims it because it's so disgusting in ANY area of the place should immediately refund customers money. 

So disappointed in this place! I do not recommend.",2017-12-17 02:37:02

So far, this is the best place that I have found to eat taiwanese style noodles and xiao long baos!  It is more expensive than in other cities, which have an abundance of these type of restaurants, but it's worth it.

I'd recommend ordering:

*Beef Noodle Soup
*Xiao Long Bao's
*Beef Rolls (my favvvvvvvv choice at these types of restaurants, although again, the portion is pretty small at Everyday Noodle)
*Zha Jiang mian

Nice place at Tivoli, too bad the service was so deplorable. From the hostess (who'd rather chat with the waite staff) to the manager. The whole time we were there it was like a social hour for the workers. The bartender(?) took our drink and food order. 

Two of the kitchen staff brought out the burgers which were good. We were sitting right at the end of the bar so the staff (including the manager) had to walk right by our booth. Not one time did anyone there ask if the food was ok, need another drink? etc..... I flagged down the manager for the check. He had the bartender bring it so he could continue his conversation with a newly arrived waiter about the Packers/49er's game. When the bartender brought the check THEN he asked if I wanted a beer? Really?

The primary reason we went is that our friends in Solvang CA 'Sort This Out Cellars'
are the suppliers of the 'Double Helix' brand wines and soda sold at this poor excuse of an eatery. When I asked about the wine they said it was 'good' and from CA but
'not sure where'. Wow what a review. Did I mention that the place was almost empty.
Some guy slobbering over a girl at the bar, A guy homesteading a booth with a baby in a car seat. (The baby was good.) And there was the waite staff chatting it up. 

The place is real nice and the play list is eclectic and enjoyable and not too loud.
The location is good and the food was ok. One of the burgers was $15.

The service in particular was nothing short of spectacular, especially considering the size of the event and the Downtown notables in attendance (Mayor Gordon, City higher-ups, media). 

I love the Butcher's view of US Airways Center and Chase Field and its vantage point will only improve if the city can just find a way to utilize that awful parking lot across from the basketball arena. With business reemerging in the warehouse district and baseball season fast approaching, things are definitely looking up for those blocks of Downtown.

Anyway, back to the Butcher. The entrees were well-received. I found my pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread to be way too salty, but I figure I made my own bed ordering cured meat on a pretzel. The crab cake salad, stew, jambalaya, roasted chicken and salmon plates all received enthusiastic thumbs up from our table and the desserts (cheesecake and chocolate cake cups) were delicious.

The bar is a huge square with heavy stone counters, plenty of seating and flatscreens, insuring that the Butcher will be a popular happy hour and pregame destination. There's also a wraparound patio.

We found Dr. Gordon Donesky on Healthgrades.com, and he has lived up to the hype! It was gently explained to me by one of the Front Office gals that he does tend to run a little behind, but that's only because he takes a good deal of time with his patients. And isn't that exactly what you want from a doctor? I've never felt rushed through an appointment, and Dr. Donesky takes the time to make sure all of my questions and concerns have been met before he moves onto his next patient. 

Moreover, they give their patients access to their entire medical record via an online portal. I can check out my labs or essentially print off my entire medical profile if I need to. How cool is that?

I wouldn't hesitate to refer a friend, a  family member, or a fellow Yelper to this office.

I have been to good concerts and walked away feeling like this was a five star venue.  I have been to others and I hated it and vowed I would never be back.  

Pros
-not a bad seat in the house and since the stage rotates you always have a good view
-drinks are pretty reasonable for a venue (not reasonable in general, but compare it to say US Airways Center)
-There are plenty of places to get concessions for such a small venue so the lines for them are never too bad.
-The downstairs lounge is pretty cool before the show and it is fun to look around at the stuff displayed on the walls.
-security does a great job here.  I never feel harassed, but at the same time I have seen situations break out and they handle them ASAP.

Cons
-Parking.  The last two times I went they had increased to $10 for parking.  At this point I think they have the highest priced parking I pay for any venue in the valley and they have their own lot, so it is not even necessary.
-Will call lines are ridiculous.  If you have tickets at will call, plan to get there an hour early.
-Security lines to get in take forever as well.  My advice for this though is walk around a bit.  They have quite a few entrances and you may be able to find a short line at one.  People tend to follow the crowd.
-The seats are small and uncomfortable.  If I have general admission tickets I tend to go to the back to have more space, but sometimes it is unavoidable.
-I wish they were in a better location where there were near by bars to have a drink and a bite to eat before or after the show close by.

The last thing I wanted to include, but don't want to put it as a con, is there sound system is very inconsistent.  I don't know if it is the sound men touring with the artists or what, but I have been to shows that have had great sound and pulled me out of my seat.  Then I have been to others where I knew the artist and their songs and liked them, but left early because of how bad the sound was.  Like I said if you really like who/what you are about to see then by all means go to this venue and you will have a great time, but if you are on the fence about the entertainment, you might want to stay home.",2015-08-21 23:23:16

I found Platinum Entourage on Yelp back in March 2016 while visiting from New York so I made an appt for Balayage color with Todd. My credit card was taken to secure appt. I was told that if I don't show or cancel with ample notice my card would be charged. I thought that was fair. I was sent reminder texts leading up to my appt. which I appreciated.
My entire experience with Todd, his assistant Kaysey and Charles were Excellent!
Kaysey is sweet, caring, professional and knowledgable. She was very patient in answering any questions I had about my hair. After meeting with Todd to discuss my color options Kaysey went over pricing with me. There was no pressure. I was not uncomfortable. I was very satisfied and happy. I thought I've never experienced a salon go over pricing with me before the service so I knew exactly what I was paying for. I appreciated that very much. 
Todd was very nice, caring, patient, professional and genuine. I felt like I was talking with family, like I've known him for years. He is very knowledgeable about hair and color. I am very happy with how my hair turned out. 
Charles at the front desk was very nice, friendly, patient and professional. 

I highly recommend Platinum Entourage.

Stick with sliced lamb and beef for meats and you'll do just fine. The seafood, though obviously not top quality, is good for an AYCE place. There are some decent veggies, and I'll suggest having some near the end of the meal. Forget the fried buns at the top of the sauce station - filling up on carbs at an AYCE place is for amateurs ;)

The place does get busy on weekends / winter-time, and so there might be a wait for the sliced meats to come out. Just enjoy the experience and don't rush it.

My visit today was so disappointing. There were a group of 6 of us there for my mother's birthday. I think our server was recovering from a major night out or this was her first day ever with a job. I get it- being a server is hard. I stuck it out for 2 years and eventually gave up, because I wasn't a very good server. But NEITHER WAS THIS PERSON. 

We had to flag her to come take our orders. She seemed surprised like ""Oh, I've only given you 20 minutes to read through our one page menu. Are you sure you're ready?"" We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered. We had to ask for coffee refills eleventy-billion times. We had to ask for red pepper flakes twice. We had to ask for our bill twice. I never got my water refilled once. I ordered a beer that never showed. We waited and waited and waited for everything. There was one other group of four in the entire dining room, so it's not like it was slammed. We still tipped her well, because- life is hard, yo. 

The food wasn't all that great this time around. I usually go for dinner and today, it was lunch. So maybe that makes a difference? My husband's Reuben was the most pathetic Reuben I've ever seen! If I'm going to pay $10 for a sandwich that meat better be at least an inch thick. My dad said his burger was ""meh"". 

I love their red sauce and their meat sauce, their stuffed peppers, and their fried provolone. The salads are good too!

I came here on my lunch break on a Friday afternoon. The place was very quiet, but that's exactly what I was looking for during the hour of my day I had to relax. Upon seating, service was prompt. She took my order in about a minute as I knew what I wanted. I got the order of spring rolls for $4.99 (an order of 4) and the Chicken Pho $7.99. 

The spring rolls came out quickly, and were a tad bit small in diameter but needless to say they were really good. They weren't overly packed with rice noodles or lettuce and had a nice crunch to them due to the lettuce being fresh. There was also a decent amount of shrimp and pork in there, which makes it worth the $4.99. I ended up taking 2 home. 

The pho was pretty good. It had an aromatic smell and flavor, which is nice compared to some places that serve it as a steaming bowl of sodium with no flavor other than overpowering salt. The thing that kind of irked me about it is that for $7.99 there was hardly any chicken in it. And when I say hardly, I mean like about 6 quarter-sized chunks of chicken in a large bowl of broth and noodles. Not exactly the bang for my buck that I was looking for, but nevertheless it was still good. 

I ended up paying about $14.50 for lunch, which is a tad bit pricey in my honest opinion. Especially considering that places a little further would cost me under $10 for the same meal, and more chicken added to my pho. Oh well. Because they are close to me and the food was quite good, I most likely will be returning, however not as frequently as I would like because the prices are high especially for lunch.  

Just as a side note, I understand that this is a family-owned business, which is always a plus.

Tucked away in a small strip right across fiesta mall you will find this yummy sandwich shop. The menu is endless and can be quite overwhelming as there is so much you can choose from. It was our first time there so we took our time and looked over the menu to see exactly what we wanted.

We ended up ordering one number 1/2, (Its the first one on the menu) one number 21, and a number 25. We also got a regular drink and an order of their air fries (employee informed us that the fries are not fried). All the sandwiches do have unique names and a number next to them. You can pick your bread (wheat or sourdough) and they have a vegetarian selection as well. 

Our total was close to $40, and the cashier was nice. 

We sat down and waited about 10 minutes. The employee brought out our food, and was friendly. 

The sandwiches are huge and are cut in half. My sandwich (#25) was amazing! It was turkey, avocado, and bacon on a sourdough bread. They definitely pack your sandwich with a ton of meat and enough veggies. You can add more toppings if you'd like for an additional cost!

I got to try the other sandwiches as well and they were just as delicious as mine was! OMG THE AIR FRIES WERE AMAZING!!! Piping hot and crispy, MMMMM. Will be back soon!

Check in on yelp and get a free bag of chips!

They have a kids menu!",2018-05-09 19:10:00

They checked us in efficiently and the front-desk staff was very courteous. Took them about 20 minutes to get us into an exam room, which was understandable 'cause there were about 8 other pets in the lobby before us with appointments. 
Dr. Khamsi (sp?) was very nice and respectful to Shae and us. She and the staff gave us options to choose from, and the price was reasonable for an X-ray, medicine to help Shae's throat inflammation, and 6 cans of soft dog food to help digest in this situation. 
I have to mention that this is the second time I've had a good interaction with the Craig Road Animal Hospital - took Shae here about a year ago for her spay. 
Their price for the surgery was comparable to the animal shelter. I also recall being able to schedule the procedure for the day after I stumbled upon them on Yelp, so I thought that was accommodating. She had a reaction to the pain meds they gave her for the procedure, but they were able to see her right away without me and my (then) boyfriend throwing a fuss as overly-concerned pet parents.

The main disappointment in our experience (and this is a big deal in AZ) was that the theater itself was SO HOT. It was probably 83-86 degrees during the entire movie. Normally I bring a light sweater to movies, expecting it to be (thankfully) colder, but it was way too warm, and the leather/pleather seats did not help with the matter. The theater our movie was showing in was #9, near the end of the building, so I'm not sure that had something to do with it.

It's big, service is great, the drink and tap selection is huge, they have gluten free beer for celiacs like me, and the tacos are great!  The late night happy hour is great too.

When if first opened, service was a little rough/slow, but I think everyone's gotten the hang of the massive bar.  Service is always quick and friendly too.  I especially love that servers know the menu and are willing to check with the kitchen about ingredient questions without hesitation.  I'm celiac and gluten destroys my insides, literally, andI questioned why the cheese was not listed as gluten free.  Turns out they just wanted to be safe in case they ever have to use pre-shredded cheese that used flour as an anti-caking agent. Since they normally shred the cheese themselves, it's safe for me to eat.  Although, the smoked cheddar might not be gluten free and that's understandable.

This place only turns into a mess during home games, but only because of the crowd.  It gets packed to capacity and that just ain't my scene.  If you don't like long waits for a seat and wall-to-wall people, avoid it immediately before and after a home-game.

Like all Bario locations, I wish the bowl option didn't cost an extra $1 for what seems like the same amount of food as a regular taco, and I wish they had nachos.  I can use the bowl option and the free tortilla chips to DIY some nachos, but it's not the same because you won't have the gooey mess of cheese like normal nachos.

She will take care of you guys for sure. Mastro's is located inside Crystals mall in the City Center. We were there on a Sunday night and just had the most pleasant time. 

We had just an appetizer with our drinks. We got the calamari. It was good. It was all calamari rings in a seasoned breading. Delicious... You can never go wrong with calamari and theirs is one of the better ones. We also had the famous signature warm butter cake. DAMN... That really is a delicious dessert. It is like the most perfect butter pound cake topped with a tasty vanilla ice cream, surrounded with strawberry & baby orange slices and drizzled with strawberry sauce. It's so good. It's so rich but worth it if you share it. The bottom of the butter cake has a caramelized crust so when you get to that bite, you're in for a flavor kick. So good. You have to get it... I'm glad we finally tried it. 

Service at the bar was exceptional. Charelle, the bartender, made a perfect dirty ketel martini and was such a pleasant person to conversate with. Mastro's is lucky to have her.

While I have been using Yelp for atleast two years, this is my first review! That should suggest something about this place. My husband and I went for dinner last night and on the drive home discussed our reviews. He gave it a four - but only because he suggested the need for additional wait staff. 
Back to my five, Value: we had 3 courses, all delicious and and wonderfully presented for less than $40 with a good tip included! Drinks: we had the house ice tea (very clean), basil seed drink (crazy fun) and with dessert  espressowith condenced milk (sweet and strong). Food: Spring roll (good)& egg roll (top notch); the Baiynchaiv crepes(at first bland but once we played with the side -delicious- so here is a hint, we took the mintand cilantro and wrapped it in the lettuce and dipped that in the sauce and ate it with the crepe) and the Katheaw Cha flat wide noodles with beef and shrimp (the beef is very tender- delicious); grilled corn (crazy fun and a perfect finish). Service: As others have pointed out this is a two person show that has only been open 6 months- there is one young man waiting all tables... so prepare yourself to wait for a table and for the food to come out slower than other places. Personally, that made me love the place even more. It was a meal that progressed at a leisured pace and gave us time to read the books at our table and learn a little about Cambodia.
It is a double edge sword to write this review because I want this restaurant to succeed- they are doing everything right... but with more customers comes crowds and we anticipate an increase to a more accurate price point. So when you go be patient and enjoy this lovely experience, tip your waiter well and join me in the hope that this business is able to grow without changing a thing:)",2011-10-02 18:41:19

I LOVED their food, atmosphere, and prices, plus it was close to home.  Since moving, though, I hardly get an opportunity to experience Wild Wing anymore.  There's this one in the University area now, though, and I've gone there only a couple of times on my lunch hour.  Why only a couple?  Mainly the wait time.  Both times (once probably 2 years ago and once just this week) I've gone there during lunch, the restaurant was practically empty, and we still had to wait 30-35 minutes for our meals after ordering.  Seriously?  Did the cook not show up?  Is he/she still hung over from the night before?  Everything on their menu can probably be cooked in 5-10 minutes.  Maybe it's time to hire some new cooks?

On the positive side, I was very impressed by their expanded menu.  I already thought they had an extensive menu before with lots of fantastic choices, but now Wild Wing has even more goodies to choose from.  I went with an old standby, though:  ""Chicken Feathers"" (grilled chicken fingers) with China Syndrome sauce (mmm...spicy!).  You can get either fries with your feathers, or celery and blue cheese.  But you *cannot* get fries AND the blue cheese (for the spicy chicken) without paying an additional 50 cents.  And don't even try to request another tiny cup of extra sauce.  That'll be another 50 cents, please!  Luckily, I've learned my lesson over the years, and Wild Wing does a pretty good job of coating their chicken with sauce anyway.  

My partner ordered the Bleu Cheese Basil Burger.  He said it was one of the most amazing burgers he ever had, so I tried a bite of it.  He was right.  It was amazing and SO full of flavor.  Italian marinade, crumbled blue cheese, and basil mayo = freakin' fantastic.  

I guess most people who go there at lunch go for the all-you-can-eat chicken wing bar.  Some dribbled in as we waited for our orders.  I overheard someone stop one of the servers to remind her that the bar needed restocking as well.  Seriously, what's up with the kitchen at this location?  Shouldn't management be all over this?  I'd love to frequent Wild Wing more often at lunchtime, but I'm pretty soured on having to take an hour and a half for my lunch break just because the cooks can't grill some chicken and fry some fries in less than 30 minutes?  I can understanding waiting if the restaurant is busy, but when there's only 2 or 3 tables filled in your huge restaurant, come on...

Helbach's coffee shop is one that has been around for over a year now. I stop by every once in a while and consistently leave satisfied. There is both a walk in option and drive through option - very rare and notably convenient. In the first time walking in, I immediately noticed a cozy and up scale look.  The menu, obviously, offers coffee and espresso options alongside baked goods, hot breakfast, and other food options. Drive through service always starts off with a smile.

Additionally, service is consistently polite and prompt. What is also consistent is high quality coffee and orders that are made with special requests. I have an allergy to some of the syrup coffee flavorings and just a simple communication has led to consistent observation of my allergy. Really I think making an item to specific request, alongside the freshness, says a lot about what this business it.

Just walking by the arsenal of pizza on display, I was able to tell that there's quality and care put into their pies. The pizzas looked amazing. Plus, slice prices were very reasonable for what you get (around $3.50).  I had the pleasure of two different slices:

18b - Traditional cheese pizza infused with herbs. Very tasty, with a great crispy crunch to along with it.

Goodman - There's a lot going on with this pizza. In fact, I thought too much was going on. The flavor combo on this one wasn't the best with the caramelized onions, potato, etc. I preferred the simplicity of the 18b over this. Still, pretty decent.

In terms of pizza, they do come off on the lighter side. They are not overly greasy, leaving me with a notable crispy crust to munch on.  If hungry, it might take 2-3 slices to get your fill.

 It might be a little disappointing to go out of your way specifically for the pizza, but it's a definite stop if I'm in the area.

I make boba and Thai tea at home, so I can appreciate a place that gets it right. 

I love that they have a student/military discount as I like to support those kinds of businesses, and they definitely cater to the college crowd with their gaming zone attached to the restaurant. The last time I went they were playing a Twitch livestream on the tv! The employees are decent, one of them was pretty friendly and I liked him a lot. 

They have a great selection of food but for me the chicken fried rice and the cashew chicken stir fry have both been WAY too spicy to fully appreciate.

The level I am looking for is ""a little more than a little spicy"" and next time I will order it a 2/10 and if that's too spicy then dammit I'm throwing in the towel. 

I look forward to coming back and trying other things, as the price and the value for money is good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I came in here really wanting to love this place. I am always looking for more vegan places to eat because my ultimate goal is to go completely vegan sometime in the near future. We came in at around 8:30 on Saturday morning. That is one thing I have to say about their Saturday hours. Everywhere except their Facebook page says they open at 11 on Saturdays, and even the sign outside of the store says they open at 11, but they actually open at 8 on Saturdays. We might have been the first people in there because of this. And nobody came in after us until about 9:15. Maybe people are confused about the hours? I don't know. But from the reviews on this place I expected it to be jumping. I know every time I go to Pomegranate Cafe this early its packed. So maybe update your website and sign out front? Just a suggestion. 

Anyways, so we walked in and ordered. I got the vegan eggs benedict, and my husband got the tofu scramble and one of the smoothies. So we sit down and wait for our food to come out. Now I don't want to be picky, but this is one of the things I notice when I walk into a place. Its small, yes. That doesn't bother me. It just didn't feel clean to me. Most of the tables had stuff all over them and weren't cleaned right. There was dust all over everything. And a giant dead mosquito watched me pretty much my entire breakfast from the window where he was caught in a spiders web. For a place this size, there really shouldn't be any reason why it was a dirty as it was. Maybe that doesn't bother some people, but I was put off by all of the dust. 

The other thing I noticed that really bugged me, is how many times I heard them open and close the microwave. Aren't restaurants supposed to use pots and pans? I don't think I heard the sound of a pot clanging one time. And I have stopped going to restaurants in the past because I found out they use microwaves. If I want to use a microwave, I'll go home and cook myself. I didn't come here to pay ten dollars for breakfast, for it to be made entirely in the microwave. Honestly, I would rather wait an hour for breakfast so it can be made on the stove, than to have it done in ten minutes out of a microwave. 

So after about 15 to 20 minutes our food comes out. It is a lot more than I thought it was going to be. I had two pieces of toast with four pieces of tofu bacon, then topped with two tofu ""eggs"" with avocado and garlic aoli. It was served with a salad and fresh fruit. The salad was a little odd for breakfast, but it tasted good. I liked the dressing and sunflower seeds. I really liked the eggs benedict. It had a good flavor and even for as much food as it was I ate everything on my plate. My husband also liked his scrambled tofu which came with toast and jam, fresh fruit and two pieces of tofu bacon. For ten dollars you really do get what you pay for. 

I really want to come back here because I did like the food, however I don't know that I will knowing how much they do use the microwave. Maybe some people don't care about that, but I do. Perhaps, I will just have to come back and try their raw options. But really, get rid of the microwave!",2011-04-23 22:10:07

Ok. Now that the formalities are out of the way. This location is pretty good. Some advice if you are unfamiliar.

1. Never shop at the cheap racks unles they are the sale racks. If you see regular priced stuff for $5, that means it is crap and polyester. Stay away. That shit will come back to haunt you. Go a little deeper in the store and spend a few more bucks and get the good stuff. 

2. The men's dress shirts are awesome. 100% cotton. About $30-40 bucks. Perfect fit for most frames.

3. Accessorize. If you are a fashion forward dude, this is the spot. 

4. Cardigans. You might be able to pull one off. If you can, this is the place.

I ordered a 39th anniversary bouquet for which I paid $182, expecting an incredible display of roses and for the additional money Paula upsold an upgraded group of flowers within the bouquet. Upon delivery, except for the very prominent pink color, it was impressive to say the least however, I'd expect an anniversary bouquet, our 39th, to be done in red since pink is a friendship, happy thing, not reflective of a long term marital relationship. Paula offered to send some red roses for $50 instead of regular price so I agreed. 

Here's the PROBLEM, the next morning, 12 hours after delivery, all those surrounding flowers she was touting as 'special/upscale, were drooping and either dead or dying. The following day the roses were drooping and dying, the morning of the 3rd day, both arrangements were dead. Such a disappointment. When I called, Paula said she'd put in a refund and today my card was credited for half my cost of the large bouquet. So, I paid just under a hundred dollars for dead flowers. The roses were dead too but I just decided not to even call on them and accept the $50 as money thrown away.

When you first arrive, it looks like a regular nursery. However, once you start walking around it becomes more impressive. There is a huge retail section and it's a hidden gem for gifts to suit everyone. They have locally made soaps, candles, birdhouses, and lots of other cool things...like an antique trunk or wooden planters.

For a flat $75, they will deliver to your door. Also, they have plenty of staff on hand to help you. If you're not sure what you want, you'll still have a fun time roaming through their space looking at all their healthy plants!

It's a locally owned nursery and while you may think they are pricer than big box stores, they are slightly comparable. I found similar items at a big box and it was only a couple dollars difference.",2012-04-01 02:31:27

Its a small quaint room so everyone is close to the action. I loved this aspect of the show. 

The act starts with a few songs sung by his wife. She has a beautiful voice. The song choice is not going to be everyone's cup of tea as there is an opera song in there. 

Craigs magic act has some advanced magic acts that took me by surprise. Occasionally there were some ooops but Craig recovered effortlessly with humor. 

His assistant is beautiful and talented acrobat and belly dancer. 

They would love to be able to put on a show more often and I'd love that for them. My only suggestion is that the current price $38 is a bit too high.",2016-06-15 04:01:53

The place in located in old mtl, so I thought to myself is this one of those tourist trap joints? But it turns out it doesn't matter because we ate well and paid less so I'm happy I went.

We all ordered from the happening gourmand menu, which include entrée, main and dessert. For entrée I had portobello mushroom with asparagus with fontina sauce and fried calamari, then grilled veal and Osso buco  for mains and chocolate praline cake.

The portobello and asparagus were well done, with the sauce blend very well with everything. The fried calamari was also very nice, the meat was tender and the batter was light brittle and soft, it melted nicely as you bit into it.

The Osso buco was the best dish of the night, it was fall off the bone. It was served with a cheese risotto and top with a nice tomato sauce. The portion was huge but I couldn't stop eating it.

The veal was a bit dry and no sauce made it very boring to eat...

The chocolate cake was very rich, a bit on the sweet side, but you definitely feel the chocolate.

It was an exceptional menu for the price, 23-33$ depending on what extras you took. The quality of the food surprised it, I would definitely come back even without happening gourmand. They also have a pizza oven so can't wait to try that out.",2013-01-29 21:37:27

Rok shrimp - little nuggets of shrimp friend in a light tempura batter then tossed in a spicy cream sauce. This was my favorite. 

Karage chicken - lightly battered fried chicken nuggets served with a ginger ponzu sauce to dip in. 

S&P shrimp - skewered fried shrimp fried & served with a creamy, I think cilantro sauce. Not a spicy as I was expecting. 

Scallops - so tender & juicy & perfectly seared. I'm not sure what type of sauce/broth it was served with but it was delicious. 

El Chappo roll - it was good but again it said spicy but was lacking that kick. I would try different roll next time. 

Edemame Rok - spicy & refreshing bc of the lime/lemon seasoning. 

Honey toast - the best thing they have. Cinnamon sugar crusted croutons, stuffed on a vanilla custard topped with fresh berries & vanilla ice cream. It reminded me of cream brûlée, honey toast & captain crunch had a baby. I may go back just for this.

Also, I felt that since the service was so quick, that the tech or even another tech would just gloss over it and then it would break again.

Besides hot paninis, they also have cold sandwiches, daily plates (such as mac & cheese, salads, etc.), as well as breakfast items (such as granola, homemade ricotta, etc.). Just make sure you request both of the menus, as you can order from either/both of them. This place was bustling when I walked in, but the host is great at remembering the queue and seating parties quickly.  I tried their O+G Grilled Cheese hot panini that was filled with caramelized onions, Raclette, and Gouda Beemster XO, served with a cup of housemade ketchup; the caramelized onions were a bit too overpowering, and the housemade ketchup was a thin consistency of a sweeter sauce (I found this not to complement the panini at all); and, the 'Poached egg on your face' panini (filled with spicy poached eggs with herbs, mayo, Louis d'Or cheese, speck, and slow-roasted tomatoes; this was definitely the better of the two paninis, but it has a spicier kick; the taste kind of reminded of Korean spicy pork sauce (dwegi bokkeum sauce), so it had a familiar taste to it).  I appreciated the crispiness of the bread, but note that they don't brush the bread slices with olive oil or butter.  I'm open to trying out their other kinds of paninis, as I really did like the thing crusty/crispy breads holding the fillings together.  To wash it all down, I tried their raspberry & lime beverage, which seems to be the place's version of a limeade with some raspberry juice - it wasn't as tart as I thought it would be, but more of a smoother finish.  Service was super friendly and efficient, and complimentary water is offered in an olive oil bottle. Once you're done, remember your seat location and pay up at the front!

Hotyt4hVDRnxBATpSXBdVg,IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,4,3,0,2,"So I decided to give in and try a fancy schmancy place on the strip over the weekend. Usually I try to avoid restaurants on the Strip because they're overcrowded, overpriced and in general the wait is to long. Luckily I had to join my friend as she was meeting a group at StripSteak for happy hour. 

Walking up to the restaurant, we were generously greeted by the Assistant GM Miss Ashley and the rest of her hosting staff. Our group was easily accommodated since the happy hour was pretty dead. According to Miss Ashley, that was rare on a Saturday night. To me, it was luck because I would then be able to assess a fair review on this place. 

The bar area is fairly small, I would say that the big comfy purple seats do tend to take up a lot of space within that bar area that it really wasn't an ideal place for a group of 8 to be sitting. Plus we made it a little difficult for the wait staff to maneuver around. Their happy hour drink & food menu is reasonably priced. I would highly recommend their specialty, the cucumber martinish drink, it was quite refreshing and a great summertime drink. And this means a lot since I'm more of a beer drinker. The raspberry lemonade & mojitos were just ok, maybe a little to weak, but again that's just my opinion. 

My friend and I decided to try dinner so we asked the staff for a table in the dining area and were quickly accommodated. Right away we were greeted with complimentary duck fries, which we also had ordered during happy hour. These fries are cooked in duck fat so don't worry it's not any crazy duck part, which I would have hoped for. There are three different rings of fries - paprika smoked, truffle and garlic Parmesan. The sauces were just ok, it was the general concept of ketchup, BBQ sauce and truffle aioli but of course more upscale. I preferred to munch on the suckers without any of the sauces. 

Our waiter, Steve, was awesome. He highly recommended the Rib Cap & Filet Mignon, along with a side of truffle mac & cheese and honestly it was phenomenal. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and just melted in your mouth. The Rib cap, which is the end part of the rib eye, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The truffle mac & cheese was definitely the best truffle mac & cheese I have experienced in a while. Most tend to be dry but this one was moist and also had pieces of broccoli that it never lost it's flavor. We also had a side of asparagus with a horseradish blanc sauce. I couldn't complain about anything. At first I laughed at the portion size but then as we kept eating I was actually pretty full. Also it might have been the alcohol we had prior to dinner! And me not knowing if you are allowed to take a doggy bag from such places, found the inner strength to finish our food, it truly was like a scene out of Man vs Food. 

But wait, we weren't done! WTH? Steve charmed us into trying dessert, I figured what the heck, let's go all out! We ordered the beignets with their chocolate butterscotch pudding. Whew! I think I was getting drunk off the pudding, I might have been able to light a fire. However, the beignets were soft and moist and perfectly fried. 

Overall the ambiance of StripSteak is great, perfect for a date or just to people watch from the bar. It did tend to get busier as the night progressed. Yes it's quite pricey but honesty I have to say it was the best experience I have had in a while at a Strip restaurant. Michael Mina did a phenomenal job with this place and all the employees were great. To see the AGM serving drinks, chatting with customers, waiting on guests, cleaning tables and bringing out checks says a lot about the employee morale. She helped making the dining experience that much better.

The only thing I would say is that yes the meat platters need to have a little more presentation. Maybe had a sprig of rosemary or something, just to give it a little more color and pizzazz.. 

Food for thought - 1) make sure you have reservations 2) make sure you give yourself enough time to have dinner as our evening lasted over 4 hours 3) if you can't stomach rich food, be aware that some of their steaks are cooked with butter. Yay for TUMS! 4) All sides are al a carte so expect to pay over $100 for a 2 person dinner.",2011-01-10 19:42:26

This was my third and final time at Other Mama.
Third time was far from a charm.
Other Mama conveys a sense of 'busy-ness', it indeed is a room with a low ceiling and dark walls. I arrived before the others in my party. Yes, indeed I had a reservation.
As I glimpsed around I noticed five available tables, as well as available bar space. 
I was 'greeted' by an unprofessional female, whom requires experience in communication.  I informed her I made a previous reservation (she never inquired about the name or how many). A few happenings and horrendous communication transpired for fifteen minutes regarding if I may sit at the bar.  Will spare her and the person she questioned he embarrassment of that.  This said person should have addressed me bubble- he did not. 
She then returns for a third time... 
Blurts out: we are slammed. Then motions towards the seat by the door/slash 'hostess area'.  Tells me 'sit there' and she will bring me a drink. I glimpse around the room, which is the size of a basement.  I still see five empty tables (in addition with the empty seating at the bar).  I provided her with an unpleasant tone along with a sarcastic and curt reply: apparently so (in response for her ''we are slammed').  Thinking, one would catch on and have a manager come speak with me- no.  Now, she motions at one of those empty tables and tells me you sit there then.  I was more than put off at this point.  My fault for not leaving. 
The other two in my party arrive. Yet another server appears. We order drinks, five appetizers, then a bottle of wine (there are three of us). We notice the halibut on the board.  All decide we would like that as our entrees and ordered. Yes, we were still hungry as plates are small portions.  
A decent amount of time has transpired after ordering the halibut (should've had the halibut at this point). Our party watches other diners who were seated well after us received their food and finish entire meals.  
I notice a man approach the board and erase the halibut. Light bulb goes off now- run out of that halibut did you...
Forty five minutes have gone by since ordering the halibut.  I will refrain from my initial thought of what these three halibut dishes appeared in resembling.  I will accompany a picture of one of the three halibuts.  Make note that the halibut dish posted was the 'most appealing' one of the three.  None were appealing.  These dishes must be what prison slop is.  $34 on what is surely one of the worst things one can ingest outside of Rikers.",2017-06-29 20:58:08

And now it's looking for a Scottsdale man

The hosted are nice and accommodating and water is brought promptly.

We keep coming back because the ambiance is so soothing even when the place is paced to noise is spread so it is never loud.  The servers are well versed in the menu and are always fast and efficient, if they don't have an answer they will find a answer.

They have a large wine collection to choose from and a nice scotch for the man.  I usually splurge because when we come here and have cosmos because we are not driving.  The cosmos are perfect not to strong and not a vodka cranberry!  They have a well stocked bar and many specialty drinks for those who prefer others.

We are not big on ordering dinners here because we like to get a selection of our favorites.  

We love to get a plate of oysters they usually have a west coast and east cost selection so if you have a preference you should be covered.  We like the west coast oyster but have a few favorites from the east as well.  If you don't know ask they will help you decide! 

We also get a Fromages (cheese plate) one mild soft for me and tow of the smellier the better for him.  The usually do good but he would prefer even stinkier! 

Foie Gras either a plate or a tub of the butter (a small tub is to much for two people) both options are really delicious.

Fortunately, he made the right choice, suggesting we go out for dinner. With a lot of publicity about Restaurant Week, I decided to go someplace new and selected Ocean Prime. Understated and elegant, the first thing you see upon arrival is this incredible wall of wine bottles. We were quickly seated and before I even looked at the entire menu, I spotted the offering for Restaurant Week. Since I had been craving scallops, we both decided to go with the special. We started with a really nice house salad; greens (no kale!!) apple slices, walnuts and a sprinkling of goat cheese on top, all dressed in mild vinaigrette. There is something about a salad served on an icy cold plate that makes it so much better! My husband ordered halibut which was perfectly cooked and tasty. I had scallops. I was presented with three very large scallops that were perfectly cooked--golden on the outside and still translucent. Being raised in New England, we tend to be picky about seafood and these were done  just perfectly. They were nestled on a bed of cheesy risotto that had a few peas thrown in it. I'm assuming the peas were for color since I don't think anyone really likes peas. Dessert came and I wish I had skipped everything else. The peanut butter pie was a killer! Creamy, chocolaty and on a chocolate cake-like crust, it killed me that I couldn't finish it. (I did about 11:30 that night, standing in the dark in front of the fridge). This was one of the best meals I have had since moving to Phoenix. The $44 Restaurant Week special was a steal (my scallops alone were normally $44.). Any bottle of wine under $100 was half price that night. While the entryway wine cooler was impressive, the prices on wine were not and frankly, since we know wine, I thought some of the bottles were vastly overpriced. However, my husband enjoyed his $14 glass of Viognier and didn't complain as it nicely complimented his fish. This restaurant has a modern vibe with a lot of hard surfaces but did not seem excessively noisy. Staff was attentive and accommodating (especially to the young child at an adjoining table.)

I do not visit Manuels often however, a few friend of mine had a hankering for Mexican food and Manuels was the closest restaurant. When we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly and  our server immediately brought us chips, salsa, and our beverages. 

Maybe I expect too much when I go to a Mexican Restaurant but one thing I do expect is decent salsa, nothing you could buy out of a jar at a grocery 
store.  The chips were fresh however, the salsa was watery and a little spicy, it just wasn't very good. 

The menu at Manuels Mexican Restaurant is comprehensive, and offers a varied selection of entrée's.  On this visit we ordered a crispy beef taco, bean tostada, and a  taco salad.

Even though our entrée's arrived, piping hot, we all agreed the missing ingredient was a lack of flavors or taste. The food was hot and plentiful, but really had no taste. After lunch we decided to end our meal with something sweet. For dessert we  had the fried ice cream which  was delicious, the best part of the meal.

as my mother prepared to graduate from Grand Canyon University with her double major in Special Ed and Elementary Ed (can you tell i am proud?) we prepared for a trek across the U.S. for a mere 3 days, to force her walk across the stage in a cap in gown.

we made reservations for 7:30 p.m. on Friday evening and somehow, even after the long drive -- or what seemed to be like a long drive, hey! it's the desert -- we were early.  we were sat immediately outside in a corner table.  a party of 5 we ordered a bottle of wine as i tweeted away to Robert Irvine, the host of Restaurant Impossible.  ecstatic when he tweeted back to me, he told me to say hi to Gasper and Maria.  at the conclusion of dinner, we asked our server to say hi (i was fulfilling Robert's request, okay? i'm not always this toursity-- have you seen those arms? i'm not going to cross those!).  Gasper came over in his whites and Maria with her smile and glasses on her head.  as i showed them the tweet, they were so excited. you can feel the warmth and true love they have for the hospitality industry and how proud they are of their restaurant.  that, my friends, in itself is a great reason to dine there.

now. the food. 

the bread was delicious as i cheated on my diet the entire time i was in AZ.  2 orders of calamari later, with empty plates, we definitely enjoyed it.  we are calamari-loving italian family, and we've certainly had our fair share of terrible calamari.

my dad had the clams linguine. what looked like a small portion was not.

mom and sister split the prosciutto flatbrea pizza and my mom thought it was amazing.

GG also had a flatbread pizza that she devoured.

now, as for me. laugh all you want. if charcuterie is an option on a menu, i'm ordering it. no questions asked.  so i did.  i was pleasantly surprised at the amount and variety of meat AND they even had not one, but TWO cheeses on the board -- this was not an additional request, but many restaurants make you have the cheese separate. what ag great surprise and worth every.single.calorie (i just need to remember that at the gym this week).

Cheese fries was a Mexican chili bean sauce sweetened with cheese whiz on top. The roasted chicken basil pasta was not bad big portion of chicken nicely done. Pasta was as expected for these types of places. The mushroom rice was very cheesy and the rice could've been cooked longer was slightly hard but overall ok.

Les portions et les assiettes étaient vraiment grandes mais j'ai été un peu déçue par les mets. La crêpe était très épaisse, les toasts un peu trop cuits.

But, now that I have, I must say that I agree with the overall 4-star rating this establishment currently enjoys.  Chicken Noodle Soup with tender morsels of chicken, carrots, and thick noodles was hot and with a distinctly flavored chicken broth that was more robust than most.  My Ham & Hard Salami Quarter-Muffaletta was packed with meat that melded well with the minced olives and tasted great after being squeezed together by the top and bottom of the delicious yielding, toasted, and sesame-covered New Orleans style bun.

And, Diane's Beefeater was packed in a soft French Roll with even more lean meat and a huge expanse of well-melted Provolone Cheese.  A generous amount of hot au jus stood by in a bowl for serious dunking.  It was redolent of beef, with a rich flavor of meat juices that tasted great!  Pickle spears were good, but chips just the type that had been poured out of a commercially sold bag.

The place is nothing fancy, but it is serviceable and comfortable, with plenty of table and booth seating available to accommodate a large lunchtime crowd.  Table tops were continually in the process of being cleared and cleaned by a large and efficient staff as soon as a diner got up and began to leave.  

On this occasion I found a Quarter-Muffaletta to be adequate.  But next time I am going to attack a Half-Muffaletta, and see if I can handle it in one sitting.  A Whole-Muffaletta is a beast that would be more suitable for an episode of ""Man vs. Food!""",2012-12-07 10:43:29

Single room bathrooms are large and tidy (a bonus in my books for small Chinese places).

We ordered the beef & onion pancake, chicken and mushroom dumplings, fried dumplings, and chicken fried noodles. The service is a bit slow (two people serving all the tables), but they have someone making fresh dumplings or pulling fresh noodles to distract you from your hunger. 

The pan-fried dumplings were the rockstar of the meal. The noodles ranked second due to their freshness and texture. The beef and onion pancake surprisingly was DIY, but it allowed us to see how much meat they gave you. One thing I was sad about was the XLBs. That don't exist here. Why?!.

Otherwise, the place is pretty decent, and already is pretty popular (a line out the door waiting for tables). I'll be back to try a few other things later. Hopefully some XLBs will magically appear on their menu.

Today was a great day!  I got to meet my Yelp buddy, Dave G., broke bread at a couple of places, (Pane Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco) then decided to come here for some dessert to cap off our fantastic bromantic lunch date.  

I saw a flavor that I hadn't seen there before called Bananas Foster.  I asked for a sample and it tasted EXACTLY like my moms banana bread.  I knew I had to throw a scoop of that in to the mix somewhere.  I decided to go with a 3 scoop waffle cone and chose the bananas foster, dutch chocolate and fleur de sel caramel.  It was pretty much a perfect combo of flavors.  I had the caramel first and it was rich and sweet.  Below that was my chocolate scoop which was dark and delicious.  My final scoop was the bananas foster.  I was super impressed with that flavor!  I probably could have had 2-3 scoops of just that!  Like I said before, it tasted just like my moms banana bread.  It was awesome!   To top everything off, I got down to my last few bites of my waffle cone, and there was a little chocolate surprise waiting for me at the bottom (a la Drumsticks...little chocolate piece in the tip of the cone).

I use to think that this place was just a tad too expensive for what you get.  If you come everyday and eat ice cream, sure, it can get pricey.  But for an every once in awhile visit, it is well worth the drive out here and the above average cost.  This ice cream is home made, very rich and creamy, and flat out delicious!  It would be hard to argue that there is better ice cream anywhere in the Phoenix area.  I'll definitely be back sooner than later!",2016-01-30 07:05:14

This in itself raises an interesting question.  What is the ""value"" and ""worth"" of admission of an art exhibit to a person?  Do 3 paintings justify the price?  30 paintings?  Do the artists showcased play a factor?

Granted, I took advantage of a ""Free Admission"" day, so I didn't pay the requisite $15 dollars.  It's only 4 rooms, so it took less than an hour to complete, but I did see some beautiful pieces there from the ""Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form"" exhibit.  Some from Lichtenstein, and Nara, and Picasso, Degas, and Renoir.  Certainly, viewing the works of these artists has to be worth something.

And it's not like the gallery doesn't change its exhibit at least twice a year.  The staff was friendly enough and didn't follow you room to room; an issue that I had at another (now closed) museum here.  There are locals and student discounts.  It comes with a free audio tour.

So what is the price of viewing art worth to you?  If you like the artists and get a chance to see their works in person, shouldn't that be at least worth some value to yourself?  I've been to bigger and admittedly better museums, but I did enjoy my time here.

When the exhibits change, I'd be glad to come back.  And yes, I'd actually be fine in paying to do so.",2010-10-09 00:42:39

 Pretty slow during the game, even on a Friday night.  I was bummed to hear that they stopped serving food after the SECOND INNING, about 8pm, which is just silly.  I'm sure 80% of the food is just thrown in the fryer, can't imagine why they wouldn't want to make some more money and have their customers stay around longer.

After a long winded debate in my head, I decided on the beef cheek braised with onions and red wine over housemade pasta. My dinnermate had spaghetti and meatballs. I absolutely loved my beef cheeks, tender enough to break apart with a fork, but maintained meaty bite. I could taste every ingredient in the braise from the gently cooked onions to the luscious red wine. I didn't really want to share my dish, so I didn't dare ask for some spaghetti.

For pizzas, we split three among the 7 of us. We got the Southpaw. So, the description of the Southpaw threw me off because it said BBQ sauce. Here I'm thinking it'll be like a sweet BBQ. Turns out, the pizza is very spicy. It was delicious though. The spiciness didn't kick in until after I finished the entire slice.

We've only seen movies here so I can't speak on the bowling alley but the prices are super reasonable during the weekdays so we're planning on going to play once of these days. Unfortunately, last time we were here they had an SRP outage that wouldn't be resolved for a while so we didn't get to finish our movie. They did promise us to honor our tickets and provide us with free movie vouchers when we go back but we haven't' been back since. Rest assure, I'm getting my ""free"" movie. Their popcorn, drink, and snack prices are much cheaper than Harkins, it makes it so you actually want to buy popcorn instead of regretting having spent like $30 on snacks you know aren't going to fill you up. Fat Cats always has recline and dine where you either buy your food at their attached restaurant ahead of time or order your food to be delivered to you while you watch your movie.

In my opinion its the perfect place to stay, especially if you're partying at XS, Tryst, or Surrender because you can avoid the awful hour long taxi line and walk your butt back home and watch the sunrise from your balcony.  Also since its an all suite hotel you also have a mini kitchen, a refrigerator, and a little lounge area for you to watch TV and relax. The bathrooms are pretty badass too!

Where do I start. The bar area when waiting for a table resembles an upscale night club. It's loud, packed, hard to get close enough to the bar to order a drink. It was probably the part of the dining experience I didn't enjoy. 

When our party of 4 was seated things started looking up. Our waiter was great and very knowledgeable. We all had questions about the steaks and when a couple of us asked him to pick for us he sounded like Alton Brown (why he was picking the steaks for us that he did). 

He did not steer me wrong. He told me I would enjoy the Bseball Sirloin because of the thickness and my preference to have it cooked medium rare. He couldn't have picked better for me. The peppery crust and thickness was perfect. The taste was out of this world. 

I was relieved that no one in my dinner party requested steak sauce. I get so embarrassed when I am in a nice establishment with great cuts of meat that is seasoned just right and someone drowns it in crap sauce.

The freshness and flavour of the sushi was not on par with what you'd pay for and expect in a more formal setting (I got the sense the food was pre-prepared), but both my rolls were still entirely delicious.

The food here is made even better by frankly outstanding prices.

The service was friendly, and very fast despite it being a super-busy Saturday night.

So here's the deal...you can have good food and really inexpensive drinks but people will eventually just settle for a more expensive and much more mediocre meal down the street  just because the service is better.    The competition is fierce in this town...step it up, guys, I want you to be around for a long, long time.  I'm spoiled by living in Central Phoenix but my friends have to travel to reach you.  Make it worth the trip.

P.S. Should I even mention the ""working girl""at the bar?  I'm all for free enterprise  but she got much better service than we did.",2014-05-11 10:15:04

I've been here twice so far since the re-open and both experiences were very pleasant. 
The new owners(two sisters) are extremely nice and welcoming. The inside of the bakery looks neat and clean (A/C is functioning now). 
Lots of new pastries to choose from.
My favorite so far has to be the eclair cake; it's the most scrumptious pastry i have tried. Also, the almond croissant  is always a delicious classic cappuccino companion, and the new owners always have plenty on hand.
Also tried a ""Swan"" creampuff (see my photos)
It was a citrus choux pastry filled with cream, also a tasty and unique treat!
Cappuccino was also smooth and potent!
Overall, loving this bakery so far!
It's our new go-to spot for sit-in coffee n pastry.
Wish them all the best!",2017-08-17 22:06:42

- Live music on a giant stage.   
- Plenty of food vendors with different options 

The bad: 
- I had a really hard time parking on a weekday.  Every garage I went by was full.   
- The booths were set up in a way that didn't allow for a whole lot of walking room.  The aisles were super narrow and it was hard to get around people who were stopping to look.    Not a stroller friendly place, but that didn't stop people from clogging the place with them.",2014-06-13 00:38:04

When we arrived, we ordered some appetizers for the table and some drinks.  If you haven't yet tried Hachipuri, a famous Georgian cheese-filled bread with a cracked egg in the middle, then you basically haven't lived.  WOW! Totally delicious.  I will however advise that you don't eat the whole thing, as it could be quite filling.  Salads were equally delicious.

I ordered the Chicken kebab, with a side order of veggies and fries.  I like the fact that their cook took advantage of the nice weather and barbecued the meat right outside on the patio... Gave off the impression of being truly at home in my own backyard.

The meat was succulent, very juicy and plump.  Absolutely no complaints.  The veggies were hot, right off the grill.  The fries, however, were still kind of raw, and not crispy.  If I go back to Suliko, I will definitely ask my waiter to have my fries cooked longer (or just simply not order them at all).

The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one ""just to be sure.""  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.

Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!

The tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.

When they recently closed for renovations, it had been well over a year since the last time I woke up at home on a Saturday and didn't go to Nu.  But when they reopened, everything had changed.  My previous review, a well-deserved 5-star celebration of one of the best menus in the city, is now but an elegiac memory that will likely haunt me for the rest of my days in Pittsburgh.

I praised the babkas, now reformulated into bread pudding or kugel like cubes that don't hold a candle to what used to be one of the best desserts I've ever had in Western Pennsylvania.

I declared the latkes an unarguably superior breakfast potato, but they too are gone, replaced by an OK potato kugel.

The Jewbano, that creative and delicious fusion sandwich I recommended to every first-timer?  Gone, along with the ability to get the smoked meat it contained.

I scanned the new chalkboard menu (which honestly isn't easy to read from some of the seats, and there's no printed alternative), looking for my favorites, only to determine one by one that they had all vanished.  The turkey?  Gone.  The matzo balls?  Gone.  The kreplach, the grown-up grilled cheese, the fantastic omelette that had become an early Saturday go-to...all gone.

By my count, the 11 strongest items on the menu had either vanished or been replaced by a far inferior substitute.  It's possible not every item is gone forever.  I was told they'd change the menu regularly and update the website and/or their Facebook page with the menu each week...though sadly, that turned out not to be true.  The website still has the old menu (dated 6 months ago), and 2 weeks after the big reopening, the Facebook page has no relevant information on what might be served on any given day.

Right now, Nu is...OK.  It's not bad.  Pretty good.  Decent.  If I had walked in for the first time this month, I'd be reasonably pleased.  But given what it was, I'm sadder to write this 3-star review than I ever have been for a 1 or a 2.",2016-10-14 19:56:47

I had to go with a catfish jamburrito.  In addition to the menu saying it was famous, the uniqueness warranted a try.  Catfish jambalaya wrapped up in a burrito, how do you go wrong with some cajun-mexican fusion?  The catfish is cooked well and the spices are hot!  The hot sauce served on the side only makes the dish better!  The lone issue I had with the catfish jamburrito was the cheese.  Every time I got a bite of cheese and fish together, it just didn't taste right.  Despite the culinary faux pas; For just $8, it comes in a very generous portion which will fill you up for the rest of the day.

I had never been to Evviva before and the reviews on Yelp aren't the greatest, but I was nearby and super hungry. So, I decided to give this place a try.

We waited for about 20 Minutes for a 2-person table and finally got a booth. The menu is pretty brunch-standard. They have omelettes, sandwiches, salads, waffles, etc. I decided to go for the Evviva omelette, which is essentially a veggie one with tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, spinach and onions. It came with a side of toast and potatoes. The food was alright, nothing really special to be honest. The omelette was a bit oily and so were the potatoes. Nevertheless, I did finish it (the omelette, not the potatoes), so it was fine. I also had the maple latte, which was actually very nice! They have lactose-free milk, which is awesome.

My mom wanted coffee at first, but then decided midway through my meal that she wanted to try the berry waffle. So I completely forgot to take a picture of it, but it was huge and beautiful. And the waffle was super fluffy. I really enjoyed the waffle, more than the omelette actually. 

I would come back here for their waffles that's for sure. They also have chicken and waffles on their menu, so I might be adventurous and try that out one day!

Toasted marshmallow: I sort of failed to tasted the ""toasted"" part of the flavour and I probably only noticed 3 physical mini marshmallows in the entire scoop of gelato.

The spring rolls tasted awesome as well and we finished those in a heartbeat haha. The bbq pork wrap was packed with so much flavor that I ended up eating all of it myself...seriously the food was on point!

The service: Despite it being rather busy, the waiter (todd) was super attentive and kept our drinks topped off. He even stopped to chat with us a few times, which I thought was really cool of him. I feel like at a lot of the other pho places in town, they just barely talk to you and just make you feel like a number. 

The atmosphere: I think the decoration of the place is actually pretty neat... They have these indoor ""rafters"" if you will, simulating a street like feel. There was also a large flat screen TV by the register that had basketball on which was cool.... so basically this place would be awesome to eat some pho and watch a game or something.

Long story short, it made the dish. The shrimps were super moist and tender, like they had been poached instead of grilled like most places do. Fiancee had the Chilean sea bass tacos again, and as per previous review, they were exceptional. 
The service is always great, and multiple servers checked in on us and were playful.

The server was courteous and attentive. Unfortunately, the fare was not as commendable.

I ordered the lamb curry ($8.95) lunch special; A hot chai tea ($2.50); and vegetable chaat samosa ($6.95).

The chaat arrived first, a heaping plate of green chutney, creamy yogurt, and innumerable other colors and flavors. The chaat was just okay. Try the chaat at Mount Everest down the road to see what real chaat should taste like. 

The chai tea arrived after. A big steaming cup with a dollop of curdled cream floating on top. This was so disappointing. It is impossible to find good chai in Las Vegas. Does not taste like Indian chai tea.

Next the lamb curry arrived with a heaping scoop of jasmine rice. It was bland and unenjoyable. 

My friend enjoyed her chicken tikka masala and naan. I tried the naan and it was hot and fresh, though a bit thin and crispy.

And it's so cool that now we have a place we can go to to experience that. I was born in Taiwan but came over to the USA when I was young so do not know of the fabulous night markets that my mom talks about. 

The decor here is very cute and makes it a cozy place. 

Moving on to what I have eaten here...

Fried Squid Balls- These are salty and have a hint of ocean taste. I like them these little balls of friend goodness. 

Tea Flavored Egg- This tasted just like a regular egg to me, not sure if it was because it wasn't steeped long enough but I enjoyed the soy sauce eggs that come with the bento boxes more. 

BBQ Pork Sausages- These definitely don't taste like American sausages, they are bit sweet. I like them but I can see the flavor throwing off some others. 

Crispy and Salty Popcorn- Delicious snack, can't really go wrong with this. 

Fried Chicken Cutlet- This is a HUGE piece of chicken. Delicious but I wish they maybe cut it up into pieces for you. 

Tainan Braised Pork over Rice- I wish there was a little more pork in the serving but I do really enjoy the flavor of the pork. 

The bento boxes come with broccoli that I wish they would season with some salt or pepper! It is literally just steamed broccoli. 

The teas here are nice because you can adjust the sugar and ice levels. The drinks aren't overly sugary. I love the coconut jelly option, their tapioca balls are also great. Can't wait to come back to try their faerie jellies.

From the times I've stopped in business seems good! While there may be better Taiwanese food out there this is the only place in Madison and pretty decent for being the only option so I am giving them 4 stars.

Yes, this is a new (old Max & Erma's) location, never been to the old location.  Yes there are still remnants of the old there, no remodel was done, but that does not mean the place does not have character.  Something intimate about walking up that staircase, or even taking the small elevator up to the restaurant area.  It feels bright once you get upstairs.

My recent visit was during lunch in the middle of the week.  I met my friend and didn't even have a chance to greet him and we were being seated.  An instant later we were greeted by our waitress with water for the table.  We were told the soups of the day and off she went to give us some time to look over the menu.  Even though we were delaying her a bit by conversating, she was patient with us.

I ordered the GW, my friend ordered a burger.  The GW is a a nice mixture of roast turkey, melted  brie, and granny smith apple slices (yes, I know it's odd, but it worked (now what's bland about that?)).  All that between two slices of  multi-grain bread with honey mustard and then toasted.  The combination worked so well together that if you didn't actually see the turkey and granny smith apples, you'd think you were eating a high end grilled cheese sandwich.  Your choice of side was either hand cut fries or Cole slaw, or you could upcharge and get sweet potato fries or onion rings.

My friend ordered the Average Joe burger where you can basically build your own burger.  He ordered it medium rare and it came out cooked perfectly good.

Towards the end, and this is the reason I could not give this place five stars, we felt a little rushed to leave.  I could understand if the place was packed and people were waiting outside, but that was not the case.  There was brisk business going on, but that was no need to rush us out.  The check was delivered and we didn't even have time to check it before the waitress came back.  She actually had to be told that we didn't even look at it yet.

I normally eat a lot later in the afternoon, but I was particularly hungry and went shortly after it opened for the day.

I was immediately surprised at the sheer volume of staff.  Three managing the cash registers at the front (nearby Hero Burger could learn a thing or two) and another eight in the back.  That's right, I counted 11 people working to make chicken and sides before noon on a weekday at a tiny, off-the-beaten-path location.

The coupon wasn't clear as to what I got for free, so after some clarification from the helpful cashier, I ordered the 3-piece chicken (all dark meat) with shoestring fries as my side.  Even with the coupon, my order came to $9.  I was told it would be a few minutes and I could be seated while I wait.

As I sat, I watched a couple other customers get their food.  I was impressed with the way the food was delivered (in cool trays with the dipping sauces elevated), and the overall style of the restaurant.  I got the impression that whomever designed the space left nothing to chance aesthetically.  I also liked the added touch of having Coke served in glass bottles.

That being said, I was the second person in the restaurant when I arrived and I was watching people who came in after me get their food before me.  I know that some dishes take longer than others to prepare, but waiting for food when other people are eating is a bit of a touchy subject for me.

Overall, I probably waited about 10 minutes for my food, which is a little bit ridiculous given the 11 aforementioned staff members.

The food itself was nothing to write home about.  The portion size was fine and I felt full after eating, but it all seemed so salty.  There was nothing really groundbreaking about the chicken or the fries that makes me want to go back for one or the other.  As well, I wasn't a fan of their plum sauce.

I'd probably eat there again, but only if someone else was treating.",2012-06-27 21:17:37

Positive:

I did some research online and found Kangamoo & I'm so glad I did.  When we arrived, I was pleased to find that they only charge for the kid & not the parent. $10 is very affordable & they even offer affordable monthly passes that you can share with another person... so awesome.  Everything is surprisingly clean too because they require socks only.  The most important part is the employees make sure to check that the stamp on your hand matches your kid's hand when you leave... you know... so that no one snatches your kid.

There's a lounge area for the parents that includes:  televisions, massage chairs, coffee, tea and the most exciting part... there's a track with weights available so you can work out as a parent while your kid plays.   They also have an elliptical!  There's a smaller area for younger kids, a book reading station and coloring book station, as well.  On Fridays, they offer free face painting and balloons.  So all in all, not bad for 10 bucks and an indoor place with AC for the summer.  I'm thinking about having my daughter's bday here too.

The only negatives:  it's pretty crowded most of the time, which means the parents' lounge is packed.  Also, I think they put some sort of wax on the slides that make them super slick & fast.  The second time I went, my daughter kept turning sideways and hit her head both times just because it was so slick.  
Lastly, the snacks they offer for purchase are all healthy, which is awesome; however, they sell protein packs with cheese & nuts, etc.  My daughter has a severe nut allergy, so if someone dropped a tiny morsel of a nut & my daughter picked it up and ate it, it could kill her.  I would suggest becoming a nut free facility to avoid any preventable legal issues... just saying.

We came in on a Tuesday night - it was empty except for two other tables. The atmosphere is nice and well-lit. Casual but very neat. Service was nice and attentive. 

 We ordered:

Well done beef and flank pho ($8.75 for a large vs S - $6.50; M - $7.50):
The soup was all right.  It was more soup than noodles and beef though. Decent noodles but the flavour wasn't strong - it was a bit bland like the soup was diluted. I liked the beef though - flavourful enough that it sort of made up for the soup base - I just wish they put more beef and noodles. 

Deep fried beef and pork rolls with lemon fish sauce (2 rolls for  $4.00):
These unfortunately didn't taste good. I was expecting something similar to other rolls that we've tried at other Viet restaurants - crispy, juicy, flavourful, and sweet. But these rolls didn't hit the right flavours. They tasted a bit old, a bit burnt, and the sauce (that's usually found at every Viet restaurant) was off too - too much lemon. These rolls are our usual go-to app at a Viet restaurant but I can't recommend the ones here. 

Grilled chicken and shrimp with fried rice ($10.25):
It all tasted burnt - especially the rice. There was no bite that didn't have a burnt tinge to it. The rice and chicken also lacked flavour. Although the shrimp was all right, it was a dish that we had a hard time finishing - we kept picking at it until we ate most of it. 

I can't recommend this place because, to be honest, there are better restaurants for delicious Viet food. I walked in expecting an experience similar to other reviews but I walked out disappointed.

I had dinner plans with a friend and we were both craving something flavorful as usual, and also wanted to go somewhere we haven't been. Scared of encountering yet another lackluster Thai restaurant we decided to try Cafe Lalibela and convinced two other friends to go with us. I haven't had Ethiopian in awhile and it was like experiencing it all over again. 

The inside was small and quaint... and packed! However, after being told we'd have a 20 minute wait, we only had about 7, which was great because the smell in the place was exquisite and was starting to make my stomach sing. 

The four of us ordered the Lalibela Exclusive with the addition of an order of the Asa Wat, which was fish. I had a glass of Ethiopian honey wine to go with it. It was incredible. I was so glad we added the fish because that was by far my favorite, followed by the spicy beef. The cabbage and potatoes was pretty delicious too, though I didn't really find one thing I didn't care for. It was very flavorful and the injera was the perfect addition. The wine was great also. 

The service was pretty slow, which became an issue with us wanting to hit up sweet republic after and we had to hunt down our check ourselves. It wasn't enough that I wouldn't go back again though. And again. And again.",2009-08-09 17:47:05

It's a bit out of the way as I took the subway over, but relatively easy to find once you get off the streetcar. The shop was empty when we walked in (Monday around 1PM). The interior has pretty simple decorations, but the area at the back looked cute with the long hanging lights. I wish they had a proper menu - the options were printed on sheets of printer paper pinned against the wall. For such unique flavours, a well-designed menu will really showcase the artistry.

I ordered the vietnamese coffee crème brûlée paired with honeycomb chocolate ice cream. My boyfriend ordered the lychee vodka. I liked his a lot better - the flavour was a lot more prominent - but mine was great as well. 

Since we stuck around to work, I ordered a standard latte after dessert. The quiet atmosphere with free wifi certainly helps with productivity.

The grilled cheese is good - hits the spot. I have the food palate of a 4 year old and the grilled cheese is delicious and buttery without being soppy and overly greasy. My boyfriend got the steak the first time and was horribly disappointed, but I cannot fault Ritter's for that - he always gets steak at places that proooobably don't specialize in that kind of food. It was oddly overcooked and past well done on one side, but almost rare on the other. Don't really know how they did that. The next time he got a sandwich that had turkey and some other kind of meat and it was good, but now he is totally in love with the patty melt. His apartment is right near Ritter's, which is good and bad (good for the yum and bad for the waistline) and he always wants to come and get a patty melt.

After a long week of working at the conference center, this was on my way out to the taxi stand at the Mandalay, and we'd had a good experience here one of the other nights during the week, so we stopped in again. 

Backtrack a few nights prior. We had been to another high-end sushi place that required taxi rides and reservations, not to mention a credit check and possible loan. I hear it is one of those places to be seen at: the line waiting to get in was around the corner and the noise level was pretty high. Sure, it was ""all that,"" but, frankly, the service was a little lacking and they're REALLY impressed with their food and alcohol. For us, Kumi was different. Sure, you do need a reservation at peak times, or if there is a conference in town -- it is easy if you're working late on the last day and everyone else has already left town, though!

As a side note, you can get a nice jar of sake here for less than the price of the rest of your meal... unlike some other places.

I don't eat a lot of sushi, but my expectation has never been to get full eating sushi. It is more about the presentation, nuances of taste, and the overall experience. So, I do expect pay a fair bit more for a small amount of food. While this place is pricey, it is not way out of the ballpark, especially for Las Vegas and the Mandalay Bay. 

Both times we came here, the fish was fresh, the service was good and the pacing was well done. We didn't come at peak time during either visit since our eating schedule was dictated by our work and travel schedules, so your mileage may vary. 

As for the food, everything we tried was at least as good as the other places we've been to in Las Vegas The Miso Black Cod and crispy pork belly rolls are excellent, and the group liked the ""007 Octopussy,"" which is crab salad, spicy octopus and crispy potatoes in a roll format. That and the ""Hot Mess"" (crab, avocado, sashimi poke, and ""screaming O sauce"")... 

From the late night menu, the Bao Bun also has a nice combination of flavors and is good for those who don't like the idea of eating raw fish: pork belly, daikon kimchee, pickled red onion.

First, finding this place was a bit tricky the first time I went. It's in the middle of a strip mall and has a very small sign that says ""Taqueria"" rather than ""Mexican Grill"". Thankfully, I ended up in the right place, because I love the food. I walked in and found the place to be rather crowded. It's a small place with only a few tables. If they keep making food this good, they're going to have to figure out something for a bigger space, in my opinion. But of course, the disco ball is an essential element!

There are a number of options: burritos, street tacos, open burritos, tostadas, etc. Once you pick generally what you're ordering, you pick the ingredients that will go on top of or inside whatever you're ordering. I've had the open burrito both times I've gone, and I've been really happy with the results.

The red chili chicken and chicken tinga are both tasty. They have them pre-prepared when you arrive, but they heat them up on the skillet. You can choose rice, beans, cheese, sauce, and a variety of toppings like cilantro, pico, etc. The guacamole is pretty solid, although I never like how expensive guacamole is priced as a side at restaurants (side complaint). And as far as the tortilla options go, you can choose a bunch of different types: corn, corn/flour mix, flour, wheat, and they're all good. The open burrito comes with tortilla or chips, if you so desire.

After all that, there's a salsa bar with limited, but excellent, options. The spice level is excellent, and the flavor is as well.

The service is very friendly. They're happy to help you through your order, and they even checked on me as I ate my food, even though there aren't really ""servers"" in the restaurant.

I'l be back many times in the future, because I love the setup of this place, and the food is delicious!",2015-05-29 18:03:15

With the epic Melt wait lines of 2-3 hours, it's good to know that there's a great local place within a short walk that has (even better?) good food and plenty of good drink as well.

The atmosphere is great, odd that the waiting room is in the back, but since that's where the best parking is anyways, a sensible choice. It looks in much better shape than the last restaurant in the location I went to (barnacle bill's). Although I do wonder whatever happened to that big diving suit?

The food is fantastic, fancy rustic is what I'd call it, although I guess it lives up to the ""gastropub"" title. We split a cheese tray, which on it's own would probably be enough. It was a fantastic array that had much more than I expected. The waitress also brought extra crackers when we ran out. The mustard cheese was fantastic.

My wife had chicken and waffles (and so did I, for breakfast the next day from the leftovers), and I had the bangers and mash. Both were monster portion sizes of some of the best ever food I've had.

The beer selection was fanastic, not overwhelming like buckeye beer engine, or underwhelming like some other places. it was just right. They also had a great holiday and tap lineup.

At around $75 after tip, it's not the cheapest for two, but we were very much overindulging, so for drinks and snacks this wouldn't be a bad place at all.

I really enjoyed the ""crunch soup"" which they brought before the miso! I have never had this before, not sure if this is unique to Sushi House?? It's like a beefy broth with some noodles and crunchy tempura bits - awesome!!

The green salad was also very awesome, I really liked their dressing as it had a citrus spin on the traditional.

Our main was a few sushi rolls to share - spider, green dragon, kappa, California rolls were all very tasty!

We opted to finish our meal with a coconut sorbet inside of a coconut shell - very refreshing and super cute!!

The service was excellent, with a pair of friendly hosts greeting us and an excellent waiter taking care of us.  Her recommendations were delivered painstakingly and with pride.

Main courses are pretty much what you'd expect of a steak house: lots of steak, and some seafood. Beef lovers may choose between Angus beef, Wagyu beef (what most places call Kobe) and, if memory serves, true Kobe beef. There are some surprises in the side dishes. I failed to write any down except those I ended up ordering: duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones.

The feel is modern, with lots of glass and steel. An industrial ceiling is high above, below which is a checkerboard latticework of what looks like stainless steel. The floor is speckled black, white, and gray granite tile. In the bar area, the bar top is glass with a stainless steel edge at the back. Servers are dressed in black. Loud rock music is playing.

I opted for a ridiculously unhealthy meal: Angus filet mignon; duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones. The filet was firm, a little dry, but with a nice charcoal flavor. It was served with two small roasted peppers and a bulb of roasted garlic. The duck fat fries were very interesting: three small cups of french fries, with three flavors (BBQ; truffle; unknown) and three sauces (BBQ; mayonnaise; catsup). The fries were crisp, almost crunchy, and tasted great. Highly recommended. The roasted marrow bones were very good, with lots of rich marrow; very good with steak. This is something you either love or hate.

This isn't the best steak house in town, but it's an interesting addition - more for the side dishes than the steak. Prices are high but not outrageous for food that is good but not stellar. I might come back to see what other side dishes look interesting.",2007-06-22 18:45:07

Unfortunately, I was a tad disapointed. We ordered duck, ahi tuna, and asparagus with tea. It was ok. For the price we paid, I would have hoped for a little bit more umph, but it was still decent.

The decor is unique. You are seated very close to the table next to you, but it's so dark it doesn't matter. I was personally very uncomfortable in my little chair. It isn't the kind of place I'd stay all night. The most interesting part of the decor was these huge horse paintings on the walls. They just didn't seem to match anything else there...but who am I to judge someones taste in art!

Now for the wosrt part... the service. Oh man, I'd give the service a one star. Unfortunately, it was just awful.

My Brazilian good experience .. 
Side/salad bar is super generic.
Think: hummus and fresh bread; rice, macaroni salad, AKA cheap carb fillers. 
One step up from The Mandarin. 
 
Meat freshly cut off at the table.

Tonight I saw: pork, prime rib with cheese stuffed, sirloin, mild sausages; chicken Parmesan, chicken legs ... I'm sure there was more. I lost count of the neverending options (and no, I'm not kidding).
I didn't find any of it mind blowing, and the majority of what I tasted was tough, although not over cooked. 

Service was super attentive. Servers left always topped up bottles of water on the table with no request (or approval); Charge for said bottled water appeared on bill. *i will note the bottle was obviously just refilled. There were air bubbles in it indicating the lack of air seal.
Not fooling me.

The live entertainment consisted of 5 girls in little outfits moving their arms and their legs in no real sequence. The dancers looked bored, and the routine looked made up on the spot. I've seen way better drag shows. 
The silk acrobat chick sealed the deal of WTF. 

None of it was ""Brazilian' unless you count the girls little bikini outfits. I guess?

The washrooms on the top floor are amazing. Ladies: go check it out. The lighting is unreal. 

Down-downstairs there's a bar. Sort of. It's also a lounge. And a sushi bar? 
Confused? Yeah so were we when we couldn't get drinks from the one bartender who moving at a snails pace .... The music was super lame and slow. The party I was with (14 of us) stayed for a couple of drinks (which took over an hour to receive!) and headed to another bar up the street who could serve us quicker.

I'm not a stranger to this chain. I'm sure I can count the number of visits to this and other locations on more than two hands. It's been maybe a year since my last meal at a Cheesecake Factory.

Last Saturday evening I arrived ahead of my company and the parking lot was full. The lobby was even worse! So when I put my name down for three and was told the wait would be only 30 minutes, I was surprised. And when they paged me to seat us after only 20 minutes, I was shocked. First available, on the patio next to a heat lamp, thank you very much!

Cheesecake Factory has a reputation for having a notoriously HUGE menu. The upside is, they have something that appeals to nearly everyone. And I can honestly say, no matter what I was craving while at a Cheesecake Factory from Chandler Fashion Square to Arrowhead, I've always been highly impressed.

This meal was no exception. I wasn't feeling very hungry and I wanted something a little healthier than my usual fare. My friend Alex recommended the White Bean Chicken Chili. Knowing that my company eat here more than I do, I took the recommendation. It was the perfect entree for a cold night in January. Not to mention healthy and filling. I was very impressed with the other items on their lighter menu too.

Which were outstanding- fish roe, a delicate but zesty sauce, and just fried enough fish. I highly recommend. Then the turkey burger - meh, it didn't blow me away, it was fine, no real stand out qualities. The beef cheek pot roast with grits on the other hand was perfectly made. A amazing dish, braised and then roasted. Melt in your mouth meat. But the grits were frothy and flavored just enough with a buttery undertone. Just so so s'more dessert. But I don't like dessert.

The employees here are always really nice and usually open a new register when they see the lines getting long. It's always cool inside, sometimes too cool. I usually bring a sweater.

If you're looking for a cheap bite to eat then look no further, Sourdough Cafe has great prices and decent food. You can save a few cents if you obtain a players card. 

I always order the steak and eggs special which costs $4.49 with the players card, normal cost is $4.99, that's a whopping savings of $0.50 cents! Haha

Like I said, the food is decent, the steak isn't  thick, it's actually pretty thin but still delicious, seasoned right, juicy even when it's cooked well done. My eggs over medium are always cooked to perfection, hash browns are okay, they're a bit oily, the meal comes with your choice of toast (white, wheat, or sourdough) all buttered up. I strayed away from the steak and eggs once and ordered the pot roast, it was very dry so now I stick to what I know is good.

There was rarely any deals and the selections with the produce, proteins and breads were almost embarrassing. The Silverado Ranch location is 100x better with more offering of their selections and items throughout the store. It's sad to see that a basic juice/smoothie bar took up space that could have been used for the produce section.

And from looking at the past pictures before the ""renovation"", it clearly looked better before than it does now. I see how they're trying to recreate an open concept feeling by getting rid of tall isles but that's something people wouldn't seem to mind when they're more items to select between. 

Let me do add that I like the brown paper bags they use here to try to compete with the Whole Foods and Trader Joe's fans being located in the swank Southern Highlands area but it's almost unnecessary to be honest.

To get thing started, are hostess was a doll. She offered us a seat on the floor until I saw the booths, and asked for one of those instead. She didn't bat an eye, and led us to a booth. 

The drink service was prompt, and our waiter, Luis, was no non-sense. P.S. I LOVE the waitstaff attire here: they have cowboy-esque black colored shirts with pearl buttons and skull and rose embroidery. A very nice touch.

We ordered the ""Bloody Maria"" (a bloody Mary with tequila) and a house margarita (the special was a margarita with 3 street tacos). There was plenty of alcohol in the drinks and they used special care mixing the ingredients. Bloody Mary was nice n spicy! Just how I like it. 

Two of us ordered the Santa Rosa salad with chicken. HOLY COW WHAT A SALAD: black beans, big chunks of mango, lots of avocado, pan fried corn, grilled chicken, finely shredded carrots, and nicely shredded lettuce. The salad is tossed, so every bite is super flavorful. It's also super deceiving: the bowl looks small, but good luck finishing it. This salad is filling!!!!! Seriously, one of the best salads I've ever had!

The service was prompt and attentive. Luis came by a couple times to check on us, but didn't linger. Water glasses were filled and the check was brought quickly. 

Also, I totally love the ambiance in here. Lots of low lighting, leather bound menus, wood finishes on everything, etc. Very romantic!

My girls and I went for brunch and were very excited, unfortunately the food was NOWHERE near the caliber of what is served at Green. 

My girls had some parfait thing, and a donut while I had a bagel with cream cheese and an Italian soda. My bagel and cream cheese were tasty but ABSOLUTELY bland, no chives, no onion, no nothing to spice this bad boy up. My girls said the donut was dry and revolting and the parfait was nothing she couldn't make at home with yoplait and some granola. I have been WAITING to go here with my boyfriend and decided for a sneak peak and I'm glad my boyfriend didn't come because he would have been SO disappointed. For now, only Green is on the radar. It got two stars because the girl taking our order was very gracious and sweet.

Fortunately the two times that I've gone here recently it was a weekday and late morning just before the lunch rush starts - the two previous times that I tried to go was during peak hours and there was quite a wait so my companions and I opted for somewhere else.  I really like this local restaurant - the food is well prepared and fresh, the coffee is strong and delicious (just the way that I like it) and the servers are very friendly despite being busy.

On my first visit I had the Grilled shrimp & Manchego cheese grits with house salsa, apple smoked bacon topped with poached eggs.  It was hands down delicious and not at all greasy like some of the shrimp and grits that I've had at other restaurants.  My friend had the Pancetta Omelet with kale, reggiano and roasted tomatoes.  We both really enjoyed our meals and the coffee as I already stated was fantastic - it was strong, smooth, rich and low on acid - a near perfect cup of joe.  

On my most recent visit, I was alone and stopped by for a late breakfast/early lunch and I was half tempted to order the shrimp and grits again, but when the waitress told me that the Seafood Etouffee that was on special that day was soon going to be taken off of the menu permanently, I decided that I had to try it.  Their Seafood Etouffee had 3 large shrimp, and 2 perfectly cooked scallops with a tomato base that was filled with crab and a bit of jasmine rice.  This was a meal!  I was hungry and this completely filled me up - I liked that there wasn't a lot of rice to overtake the dish and that it didn't dominate the delicious flavors of the seafood in the rich, flavorful tomato base.  The ONLY criticism I have is that it was actually a little too salty for my taste and I am someone who likes salt and it was a bit much, otherwise the dish was as good as any New Orleans restaurant that I've dined at during the over 20 times that I've been to N'Awlins.  Don't despair that it's no longer on the menu however because there are dozens of dishes on the menu that I'm sure are fabulous.

Fresh off my yearly trek to Manila, I was craving a taste of home. And what does home taste like? Ube and leche flan, apparantly.

Cue Casa Filipina Bakeshop and Restaurant.

I ran in at 1pm on a Saturday and ordered a halo-halo special, plus ube halaya roll and an ube cheese tart. The halo-halo took about 5-8 minutes to prepare. No worries, because I moseyed over to the dining area so I could watch TFC on the TV.

The halo-halo special was DELISH. The leche flan was such a nice touch. And they didn't go ham on the jellies. Honestly, I typically hate halo-halo because the jelly ratio is always TOO DAMN HIGH. This one, however, was just right.

I stored my ube baked goods in the fridge to be consumed later that evening.

The ube cheese tart was divine. I would definitely repurchase - I love the cheesy taste combined with the ube. The ube halaya roll was decent - I would have liked a little bit more ube, but still good. I love the ube crumbs on top too.

If I didn't live so far away.. I would come more often just so I could have a little taste of home. (And to bring home some ube treats too.)",2017-01-30 07:45:44

Okay, maybe that's slightly too harsh. The outside has a new facade, but it's still in one of the many Vegas ghettos and the strip mall still looks buh-huh-sted. 

My sister and I went here (5/31/11) to grab some food between classes. It's really not that far of a walk from UNLV, but it's still in a shady area. Going inside, we were looking for two things - something we could eat on the fly, and Perrier. 

There's like... 5 separate aisles that drinks are located in this place. I spent a good 25 minutes going all around this place looking for any carbonated water. The water is across from the chardonnay, the Perrier is behind a box of house brand chips and below the energy drinks, which are across from a refrigerated case, juice is in a completely different section of the store. You get the idea.

The selection for everything is super limited. After spending, no joke, a good 45 minutes, we ended up getting so-so salads and a grapefruit Perrier - without the card $11, with one $9. Um, still overpriced on the salads. Frankly, Smith's is a better deal and they have way more selection. SKIP!",2011-06-02 17:35:18

I got the Kickback Chicken with cheese grits as my side. I didn't wait long until the order was ready. SO delicious. The biscuit was HUGE! No worries, I was able to tackle it. The chicken was smothered in honey - which was great, so it took off the heat from the jalapeños. Pimento cheese was yummy, too.

A very good, contemporary steakhouse worthy of the Vegas Strip.  Comfortable for a guys steak nite; refined with healthy, pretty menu selections for the ladies.

The beef tartare is an excellent starter.  The earthiness of the truffle aioli provides a surprisingly different take on the classic.  The foie gras with candied apricots and vanilla gastrique is also a must try.  Vanilla with foie sounds disgusting but it really works, enhancing the full fat flavor of the foie.

Steaks are good but not great.  The restaurant does not make any grading claims on their menu, nor do the serves openly comment on the grade. They are well trimmed and perfectly cooked.  The bone in ribeye and the Kansas city strip are very flavorful but are oddly one dimensional when compared to steaks from the ""elite steakhouses"".  Good beef flavor but missing the ""umame"" profile of good aging.

The veal chop deserves special mention (don't hate me).  It is surprisingly flavorful tasting more like free range pork than bland veal.

Sides are simple and meant to be shared.  The simple wild mushrooms are a perfect match to any steak.

The wine list is well chosen but not as extensive as other steakhouses.  Prices are in line with Vegas standards.

She came more to the table to talk about how she could split the check up than she actually did checking on our drinks or food.  Apparently they have an ""old computer"" (her words) and it makes it difficult for them to split checks. Even after we asked her to do what's easiest for her, and she suggested that we just tell her how much to put on what card, she was still stressed out about it.  I think the irony of this is that their drink menu is on an iPad. Why don't you fix the computer that you actually need rather than some drink menu that really can just be on paper. Pretty ridiculous to me. 

Not only was the service bad but the food was mediocre. I got the chicken pot pie nuggets and they were really good.

I went in as a house model, and got just the haircut I wanted (long layers) and for the first time, I got an ombré. Joanne was my stylist and she absolutely nailed it!! I am picky and particular and can be reluctant to ever have anyone touch my long hair! I could not be happier. We looked on Pinterest for something pretty to help transition me going lighter. Even Kandy the owner did not have any further instruction on the color. I just love it myself. I look like me but better than before! Isn't that always the goal??

I came last night (Sunday) around 8PM for dinner and waited ~40 minutes. Tip: Come with a larger group and you might be able to be seated faster! The bouncer was calling for groups of 4-6 before groups of 2, so also consider sharing a table with another group of strangers to get in faster :)

Food- 5/5. All the food are only $4.95 all day, everyday!! And the portion sizes are actually much larger than I expected! We ordered 4 dishes because we were scared that the portions would be too small, but 1 salad or soft taco dish would've been enough for me. Lots of vegetarian options too! We ordered: 

1. Veggie burger + fries/onion rings/salad: Huge burger and very filling. Order this one dish and you'll be good all night. The veggie patty is pretty generic, but has good firm texture. The bun is just a regular white hamburger bun and pretty basic.
2. Vegetarian 3 soft tacos + guac and chips (extra $1.25): More like wraps than tacos. Filled with soggy and cheesy tasteless cooked veggies, uhhh mediocre... Probably the least impressive dish and I would not order it again.
3. Green apple and quinoa salad: Huge and very filling due to the almonds, avocado, and quinoa. I can't strongly recommend it though because it is sooo salty, way too much soy sauce. But otherwise a pretty healthy option.
4. Beet and goat cheese salad: Smaller and less filling than the quinoa salad since has no grains and is predominantly greens, but the big chunks of goat cheese and sweet pecan clusters are filling. The salad comes pre-dressed.

Value- 5/5. Huge portion sizes for how much you're paying.

Service- 5/5. Yes, you may be hating on all the staff by the 45 minute waiting mark, but step back and you'll appreciate how polite, caring, and fun the bar staff and bouncer are! They totally know that you and your crew are frustrated about the long line, yet they are still so patient with putting up with all the sass. So bottom line, remember that the bouncer is also trying his best to get you in ASAP, so be patient and gracious. The bar staff is super attentive, coming to check on us several times about the food and how we're doing, and refilling our waters without even being asked.

I work really close to this place and will frequent it when I am looking to have a healthy lunch. I am a fan of their salad bar which has quite a big selection that ranges from quinoa salad to a basic Caesar. My favorites on the salad bar include their 3 bean salad, quinoa salad and crab salad. I am a sucker for olives and this place has a great olive bar that I can never resist visiting. 
Their hot table foods are mediocre at best, and their pizza is just ok (if you want a good slice try the Longo's across the street). They also have an extensive dessert section that carries, cupcakes, cookies, cakes and even truffles. I have had their cakes and they were pretty good but not amazing. 
On the grocery side this place has some funky and gourmet items that you will not find at your regular grocery store. Their produce is quite fresh and not overly pricey. They also have a butcher and the quality of their meat looks pretty good but I have never bought any meat here. 
This place is never that busy so if you are in the mood for some quiet grocery shopping or need a quick bite this place is a good option and a great alternative to fast food chains.",2012-08-20 21:44:34

It's my go to sushi place if Yama Sushi's full because it's across the street anyway. It's also near UNLV so I'm about it when I'm around campus and craving quality sushi. It's a 5 star place for me but I have to give it 4 because the last time I came here, it was a quick get in and get out sushi session due to one of their air conditioning was down so it was a little warm, especially during the summer! I usually like staying in sushi bars long for a good intellectual conversation, but I was saddened by this one time experience. 

It's okay though because I'll update on this the next time I go and see if it's improved by then.

The waiters/waitresses were decent and took our orders quickly. The chefs (at the bar) were always aware of our orders and got them to us quickly as well, even when it was busy.

I'd have to say the sushi was fresh and impressively portioned. I don't like having that much rice in my nigiri but they definitely go the portioning perfect! Big fresh fish cuts on a good enough amount of rice! I'm into nigiris so it was pretty bomb compared to other sushi places! I just wished they had wasabi and ginger prepared without asking, and also a personal plate to put your sushi on

I'm also a fan of their authentic Japanese decor. It's cute and relaxing, just good enough for a sushi restaurant. The area was clean as well as their bathroom. and there was enough space to get around so it doesn't feel too crowded and close together.

If you're looking for some good quality sushi and service, this place is a good spot! It's around the corner from target on Maryland and Flamingo (also near Tiabi Waffles). It's a private parking lot so it shouldn't be hard to find a parking space unless the restaurants are packed.

Overall, great place but I wished they'd fixed their air conditioning.",2015-08-09 07:02:23

That being said, I do really like the matcha sundae with shiratama (mochi balls) and anything Hojicha (roasted tea). Their soft serve is a good texture and has good flavour, though I do wish it had a little more intensity. They have a variety of little cakes for those who are not a fan of ice cream.

SZxxvVf1vCjeTW4sZeRjUg,8cxlAgkDaQk5hYPZhTQe5w,HZRTSC7R0JWThNTCqVLnsQ,5,9,0,2,"This is an Italian restaurant like no other in Western PA.

Unique would be an understatement. 

The specifics that follow should make you run to your phone for a reservation...
and since Cenacolo seats about 40, you will need a reservation. 

Cenacolo serves the best pasta you have ever eaten... made from scratch in a kitchen 15 feet away from the table you are sitting at. No veal. No chicken. No fish. 
No sauce from a restaurant supplier's 5 gallon bucket. This is about incredible, fresh artisan pasta. Fede pasta, made by Steve's passionate staff of experts.

Why is that so?

Steve Salvi, the owner, has worked in some of Pittsburgh's top restaurants. Disappointed by the lack of quality in restaurant purveyors' pasta offerings, Steve started to make his own pasta. In 2005 he created Fede Pasta, and now supplies many local and national  restaurants around the country.

Never one to walk away from cooking, Steve offered lunches three days a week at the Fede Pasta dining room. Incredible response from his patrons caused Steve to open the small, special restaurant for lunch, dinner and retail purchase of his hand-made pasta.

The menu features Affettato... thinly shaved, cured Italian meats, and Formaggi... delicious cheeses among the appetizers. Oh, you were expecting a few thin, small pieces of meat or cheese on a plank for an outrageous amount of money. Not here!
A satisfying amount for a fair price, and artistically presented. Where do these fresh goodies come from? The retail service area just a few steps from the restaurant. (Oh, yeah... Italy fits in this supply chain too.)

More appetizers: my wife and I split three delicious meatballs served with a bit of sauce and some chunky Parmesan presented on a rustic slab of wood. Wow! Good!

Not listed on the menu, but really good: arugula salad, cherry tomatoes, shaved Parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar. One of the best salads I have ever tasted.
Sure, it is included. You're family, right?

Lineamente: seasonal pasta offered at the appropriate times of the year. 

Traditional pasta served throughout the year. Classics, some with shrimp, some with salmon, some with jumbo lump crabmeat and some with short rib ragu. Yes, there are meat and seafood options, BUT the feature is always the pasta. And what pasta it is. In his years of designing pasta for great restaurants, Steve always works with the best chefs to come up with pasta that looks fabulous... and tastes even better.

Sooooooo, what would be good to drink with this incredible pasta? Anything YOU want. Bring your own wine; there is no corkage fee. This is an Italian family restaurant. You are welcome to have your favorite wine; think about how much money you just saved! Artisan Pasta is the star at Cenacolo Restaurant, not inflated wine prices.

Dessert? You think ordinary? Think again. A couple of traditional classics. Go for different. When I described our dining experience to my coworkers today, they told me they would visit just for the dessert alone... that good!

SUMMARY:

If you are here, you have read a long review. Cenacolo is a very small restaurant showcasing the talents of Steve Salvi and an incredible staff in the kitchen, in the retail product service area and servers who know the food well and really hustle to take care of their guests. 

It is a family undertaking. A special sharing of Steve's love for Italian food presented as artistically and delicious as you will find anywhere. This is not some slick, corporate, mass-production restaurant. Steve's family works in the Fede kitchen. I have been in the kitchen. There is a passion for perfection. Nice family that gives back to the community in many ways. You have to know Steve. He truly cares about people at all levels of their being. This is about helping and sharing.

I have never met a man who cares as much as Steve does... whatever the undertaking. Visit his restaurant. Say ""Hi"" to him. Enjoy the experience. You will long remember it. Cenacolo truly is different. 

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The location is in BANCO BUSINESS PARK, not the middle of Irwin. I would suggest that you drive out there during the day to find out exactly where it is. Signs indicate Fede Pasta. This is in a large building in an industrial park. You are not looking for a mall location or something you might find in South Side or on Butler Street. Fede Pasta is a manufacturing facility. Cenacolo Restaurant exists within that operation.

YOU SHOULD MAKE A RESERVATION. REALLY!

My make up application was alright. I asked for a more natural look (I didn't want to leave with bright red lips, etc) so she hardly put anything on. Had to fix when I got home, but I looked at the make up part of the package as an unnecessary extra (a freebie) so I can't complain. 

My highlights and cut were done very well. I loved that the instructors were constantly coming around to check in, but in a very casual, helpful way. My stylist was extremely nervous, was shaking almost the entire time and didn't say more than five words to me, but hey my cut and color looks awesome and it was super cheap. Again I can't complain.

We started with a butchers board/cheese platter which was great. They had some homemade pickled and smoked stuff on there which was awesome. Unfortunately, I would have to say that was my favorite part of the meal.

Boyfriend had the speitzle (sp?) and pork chop. The speitzle had no flavor. The pork was ok. I had a shrimp and grits dish where the shrimp were in a cajun style sauce and the grits on the side. My dish was much better than boyfriends but they didn't give you many shrimp, but the sauce was ok. The grits were eh...I had to salt them, and if you read some of my other posts from other places, I don't salt my food so for me to walk into a restaurant and have to salt food. 

The pricing was a bit high for what else you could get in the area that was a lot better. I don't want to knock these guys too hard because its clear they have a cool concept, but I think it needs to be fine tuned a bit.

I skimmed the play's website a little beforehand but decided to surprise myself by not delving deeper into learning the plot. I didn't really know what to expect and that was good.

I brought a date and we hunkered down with our sippy cups per Rachel's suggestion.  And my date grabbed napkins which I thought was strange until later on here's why.

I cried for about 50-60% of the show. I figured I would get a little misty but the streaming tears just kept on coming.

2. The plot transported me back in time and I was really feeling down for my people. The struggle the grit, it was really emotional. I felt like I was in the book ""Their eyes were watching God"" but with songs.

The bowls came with rice & the tandoori vegetables as well. You can pick any of the masala sauces to put on top of your bowl, I chose the only one I was familiar with which was the tiki masala. They also had a few sauces to add on the side that were all unique. The sauces were the only part of my meal that were actually spicy.  We also ordered a side of naan that was delicious!

Mike, before you write, please know what you are writing about.  Fajitas are an American food, Tex-Mex to be exact. Your GPS is smarter than you.  They originated in Texas in the 30's and 40's by Mexican cowhands working on Texas ranches.  The American ranch owners would give the Mexican cowboys (vaqueros) the scraps of slaughtered cattle they thought were unusable, one of those scraps was the skirt steak that is still used today in Fajitas.

When we walked in no one was there to sit us, I waited for a minute and then decided just to take a seat. However, once I went to sit down someone came out to help us. Not horrible, just awkward! The music also sounded a little like a Bollywood/slasher flick combined. There were moments it was terrifying and moments where it was fun and upbeat. There were several times I remarked to my date ""do you hear this music?"" 

Once we sat everything was pretty impressive. Our drinks were refilled on the regular. The first things that came out were the tabouli, pita bread, and eggplant fries with a side of Mediterranean butter. The fries came in a giant bowl. It was a lot more than we expected. They were good, but I preferred the zucchini fries that came later. The tabouli was citrusy/minty and delicious. The pita bread was puffy, like two slices of pita were stuck together and filled the middle with air. It wasn't bad, just not what I am used to. I actually may have liked it more because it felt ""lighter.""

It's $12, so I do have to say it is expensive for what you get. I wish it had at least four pieces of cheese. However, it was certainly my favorite dish of the night, and if you love cheese it is a must try! 

Then our entrees came out, with my dates coming about 10 minutes after mine which was weird but forgivable. I had an entree size of the Greek salad, and it was HUGE. It was also incredibly unique. It had all the regular trappings of a Greek salad but also a little ZING. I don't know what gave it the kick at the end, but I ended up trading it for my partners beef shwarma. He LOVED the salad.

Niu-Gu is an outlier to what traditional ramen styles are, but would closely resemble to Tantan-men or Dandan noodles. The broth is clear like much of traditional Chinese/Vietnamese noodles, cleaner and not as heavy (better for the summertime, or when you're sick in bed and don't want to eat much). The lemon pepper broth sounds strange but its really similar to Northern Chinese noodles. The bowl is brought out on a cart and then a hand torch is used on the onions to give it a char flavor perhaps. Comes with a couple pieces of charred short rib slices that are soft, a little smokey, and melt in your mouth good.

The Niu-Gu Rib items (short ribs and lamb) require you to call ahead of time, and seems to be a bit of a hassle to order and the regular lamb chop I believe has a 15-20 min wait time, so consider calling ahead if you're here for a quick meal!

Finally to experience Tako and wow.   Tako is so trendy.. dim lighting and funky décor offers a fun experience for a patron at any age.  I made reservations through yelp (of course) and received a confirmation through email the day of.   Me and my party arrived a little early and had a seat the bar where we received excellent service.   The dining area on the first floor is half booth and tables..  pretty close to each other - not so ideal for a private dining experience.  I was pleased to be seated upstairs where they are cool booths!!  It was perfect for a party of four (4).  Our waiter didn't miss a beat by saying hello right away and answered many of our questions (and took pictures too).   We started off with the guacamole.   The chips that accompanied the dip were thick and crisp.. so tasty.   Many have told me that Tako had the best guac and it was good but not the best I have ever had.  My taste buds searched for other flavors that weren't present..such as ""tomato"" or more of a an onion flavor.  It was obviously fresh but not as flavorful as expected.  My taste buds weren't singing. 

I ordered the ""Bistec"" which was tacos with steak, shishito peppers, cilantro, red romaine and was DELICIOUS!!! I could have lived on this variation my whole life. Everything was fresh.. and plenty of cilantro.. love it!  Two tacos were $15.00 - but it's worth it. To accompany my tacos ... I wanted to try the ""Street Corn"" side which was only $6.00.   It sounded so interesting. I expected loose corn but instead three small pieces of corn on the cob arrived.. smothered with Siracha Mayo, chil, cheese and lime.    It was different and very flavorful. There were more toppings on the corn than actual corn.  It was difficult to eat - but delicious at the same time.  

Don't let some of the prices fool you.. there are plenty of ""starters"" available if you are on a budget and its worth the experience.   I parked at the parking garage on the corner of sixth and fort duq and it was only $7.00  

Dining at Tako was a great experience and I cannot wait to go back!!!!!!! !",2016-12-20 16:36:53

For starters, this place has a completely new look. I wish I had taken pictures of the interiors. It looks very nice and clean. 
We went in for dim sum during brunch. Last weekend was their first weekend open and the wait was over an hour so we left and came back early today. We were promptly seated. The dim sum carts were rolling in very frequently and they had all of the good stuff - har dow, leek dumpling, shrimp balls, chicken feet, shrimp crepe, siu mai, Chinese broccoli etc. We got one of each (and two of the leek dumplings because they are SO good) and were happy to know the taste hadn't changed at all. The chili oil was also the good ol' kind that's made in-house and has been consistently amazing over the years. We also ordered the house special ho fun because that was our other favorite thing to order here, but that tasted different. Firstly it didn't have the beef-pork-chicken, but instead had shrimp and scallops. Also, it used to be a brown sauce with bok choy in it, but today's was a white sauce with asparagus.

The menu has a lot to offer, and a lot of it is surprisingly well priced, for what one might expect. The portions are large, but not overly so. Here is what I've had and what I recommend you have too: 

Seared tuna appetizer--comes with a great seaweed salad. 

Thai Calamari--love it. It reminds me of the calamari at The Liberty, but better. I'm loving the strips. 

I really enjoyed the horseradish encrusted salmon as well as the roasted mahi with butternut squash risotto. I once snagged a bite of the braised beef short rib and it was falling of the bone delicious. There is so much that I want to try! The G's house salad, I might add is 6 DOLLARS, and HUGE. Add protein of choice and that is a light meal that can't be beat. 

Please oh please, if you enjoy a molten chocolate cake, get the chocolate cake dessert. The center is not warm, but it is liquidy decadence. I would also recommend Mom's apple cake.

I am a huge fan of faux meat. I travelled throughout asia, and Loved eating at the Cantonese vegetarian and buddhist restaurants where faux meat is the star. I have yet to find anything like that in Toronto, but I am always on the hunt, for certain. 

My SO and I were both starving, so we ordered a wide variety of dishes. We started with the Deep Fried Tofu Appetizer, ($3.00) which was two tofu ""sandwiches"" served with julienne carrots and cucumbers, bean sprouts and a sweet peanut (and tamarind?) dip.  

We then had a wide noodle thai dish, Pad See Yew ($8.50) with faux shrimp, and chicken. It was really flavourful thanks to some thai basil, and the veggie-chicken was fantastic. Best ""chicken"" I have had in a while. 

We also ordered a red curry and tofu ($8.50) which disappointingly had only two pieces of tofu and was on the mild side. Lots of vegetables, but no comparison to Sukothai. Rice is extra ($1.50)

Lastly we had a GInger, Chili Eggplant ($8.50) which was really good. The eggplant was cooked perfectly, the sauce delicious and not too oily. Well worth it.

The Pad Thai is ENORMOUS. ($8.50) Every other table was ordering it. 

It must be noted that the food came out FAST even though the restaurant was busy. Excellent alternative to fast food.  The service was top-notch, and the friendly patriarch perched at the bar watched over everything. This place has an excellent vibe and we really enjoyed it. 

In the end, I would have loved some more heat, everything was a little bland. It is nice to have a lighter, healthier option than Simon's Wok in the east end, and the service was fantastic.  A little pricey, but worth it for organice and veggie treats. Dinner for two with tea $38.10.

I arrived to the bustling, fragrant atmosphere and was greeted immediately by the friendly staff. I saw LOV on an episode of Buzzfeed's 'Worth It', and I was so excited to try. I highly recommend getting reservations as it does get quite busy. 

The menu is not too large, but every dish is thoughtful and seems super tasty. Every dish here is vegetarian and some are vegan too - honestly the perfect type of restaurant for me. The decor is very nice - complete with aesthetic marble tables - though the indoor lighting is not the most ideal for food photography. They do have a patio which I would be open to trying in the future -  but it was a cooler night when I went. 

It was really hard to make choices, but I finally decided on kimchi fries as an appetizer and gnocchi as my main. The wait time for food preparation is a bit longer, but the restaurant was quite busy. 

The kimchi fries came out piping hot and crispy - but really what made the fries amazing was the aioli - it was made with a soy emulsion and tasted amazing. The gnocchi is also one of their most popular dishes and I have no regrets - it was satisfying as the filling wa sweet potato, yet light as it was made with a pesto sauce. 

The price point was also quite reasonable! I paid $30 after tax for 2 items. The atmosphere was a bit loud as the restaurant was narrow, but honestly LOV was great. Definitely a place to try in Montreal.",2018-06-21 14:02:43

After several visits I'm left with the impression that they could do away with a good 1/2 of the store. It's a 3.6 star spot that I really thing will improve even more - thus the 4 star rating.  

What I love - 

1) The Fresh.  I love their produce section.  Bagged lettuce to fresh herbs to fruit salad to jicama.  I wanted to hate the waste created by separate plastic containers for every pair of pears.  But I love it.  Makes self check out a freaking breeze, and they all look magazine quality perfect.  Besides, most folks still use plastic bags for their produce, and since F&E's plastic boxes are recyclable, I feel a smidge better - a smidge.

2) The Easy - Their pre-made foods look REALLY good!  And they are all priced pretty darn well too (Except the chocolate mouse, which seemed pretty high).  Now, as a calorie conscious gal, I haven't tried any of it.  But several of the things have been eaten in my house and really enjoyed.  Their gigantic burritos in particular have been considered quite the value as they are 2 meals big for just a couple bucks.  

3) The testing station.  Try our chips.  Try our cookies.  Try our linguini alfredo.  Wow.  They stole this great idea from Trader Joe's in my opinion, but it was an awesome steal.  

What I don't love

1) Why do they even bother selling some of this stuff.  Shampoo?  Really?  I suppose it's a nice pick up if that's the ONLY other thing you need at the store, but here it just seems ""off"".  

2) Most grocery stores I love to walk up and down each aisle.  We did that the first few times at F&E, but they gave up.  It just doesn't feel right.  I can't even tell you why.  It's like after the first 3 aisles, they just kinda gave up.  Or maybe the light gets dim?  I can't put my finger on it, but I'm a girl who loves grocery shopping and nothing over there inspires me.  Just weird.

I have lots of great things to say about the place. I love how their warehouse in California is so eco-friendly - and how some of that translates to the local stores as well.   I love running by on the way home and grabbing some fresh veggies for dinner.  We've had great successes with their fruit, veggies, pre-made food, bakery and even their meat (though a few thought it's wasn't a particularly good cut of roast, I'm willing to let that go for now).  And their coupons are great.  But I gotta tell ya - I carried their $5 off $30 or more coupon in my purse for a month and I was never inspired to spend quite that much at a time.  

I love that it's here.  I love that it's an option.  But there is still some growing room for sure.  Worth a visit, just set your expectations accordingly.",2008-01-07 20:17:12

I'm not even sure if the table next to us noticed our wailing baby.  And the service was pretty attentive, even though it was buffet style.  The staff was excellent about taking our plates and asking for refills, and friendly to boot.  Oh yeah, and it's BYOB - there is a beer place up the road, but it only sells it by the case.

The food itself isn't amazing.  There is a very good variety, likely to appease your Asian cravings.  There are some quite authentic Chinese dishes, too, you typically find at Dim Sum.  There are chicken legs, sticky rice with red bean, seaweed salad,steamed pork buns, and others.  You always have to assume the presence of other Asians in the restaurant has to confer some legitimacy to the food.  In reality, though, the food was mostly okay.

Like I said in the beginning, though, as you get older, your priorities change.   Also, for two adults to eat for less than $40 total is pretty cost-effective.  They didn't charge our toddlers, unlike some other places (*ahem* Grand Concourse *ahem* for nearly $20 *ahem* to eat fries and cookies).  I can see this place being a go-to get together spot with other friends with kids

Would I have preferred to eaten at Eleven or Meat & Potatoes, or NOLA?  YES!  Is that realistic with a party of four adults, two 2-year olds, and two 3-4 month olds?  NO!  And so as parents, we have to place convenience, expedience, and a if-my-kid-throws-a-tantrum-will-anyone-care atmosphere, above the tastiness of food.

While we appreciated how it would be good for sports fanatics, we opted for a non-TV dinner.  

I love that the burger choices at Kickstand are unique.  They offer interesting flavor combinations.  My partner ordered the Cycle Zydeco Burger (Zydeco spread, Mardi Gras slaw, and Root Beer glaze).  It wasn't too spicy for him, and he's not a big fan of too much heat.   I, on the other hand, love spicy stuff, but went with the Greek Burger as a change of pace.  It had kalamata olive spread, tzatziki sauce, and feta, three of my favorite things to eat.  The sauce really made the burger.  The burgers themselves were juicy and flavorful, too.   

There were also a lot of sides to pick from.  We both opted for the combo tater tots/sweet tater tots side item.  The regular tater tots were good, and the sweet (potato) tater tots came with a butter/brown sugar syrup for dipping.  It was literally like dessert.  What a great offering.  

With the food, atmosphere, and service being great, what wasn't to enjoy?  We'll be revisiting Kickstand the next time we're in the mood for a really good burger.",2011-02-17 16:25:05

We settled on BEVO, because they had a vegan option for my wife. I'll be honest with you, I have a love and hate relationship with this place. First, prices are typical for a touristy area like the Old City. Food was tasty, but somewhat overpriced. I had Tortellini con ricotta e spinaci (tortellini with spinach and ricotta), which cost $19. Now, if they served 7-8 of them, I would not have a reason to complain. However, they served 4 tortellini. **FOUR** for $19. That's $5 for each tortellini. This is ridiculous! Sure, they were INCREDIBLY tasty, I admit. The chef did a wonderful job....but $5 per tortellini is a rip off IMO.

Service was alright. Nothing to write home about. The patio was ok too. Not too noisy and steps away from the main street with souvenir stores.

Perhaps this place is great for drinks at night, since they have a pretty cool decor and bar inside, but in terms of food, I'd rather go to a different place next time, which has a better ratio of value for money.",2016-07-15 19:15:58

M'lady and decided to try this venue for a bite to eat when we were starving, figuring that AYCE (all you can eat) would be a good way to go.

The prices for an AYCE dinner of $19 weren't bad and their walk-up buffet selection seemed some-what alright, plus we had the option of ordering sushi from the menu (sashimi is always an extra $2 both at lunch and dinner), so we went for it.

The only vegetables they had at the buffet were cold, but the rest of the food wasn't bad. Then when placing our order for the sushi, the server missed part of the order due to being distracted by one of her co-workers across the restaurant which wasn't very pleasant. Regardless when the sushi arrived, I had a number of piece of it, and I started feeling sick to my stomach, so I decided to stop before it was too late. I was hoping we wouldn't be charged for the pieces we couldn't eat. Some of the pieces looked so slimy and unappealing, that we were convinced that if we were to try a piece, we'd be ill.

2. The bagette sandwich bread is crusty some call it ""hard"".   Some people (me) like it that way.  If you like soft bread stay away or get croissante sandwiche.

AkyDD7yEnaV-C8qzTlGG5Q,u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,bsrj9_hFAql3dlSf244zpg,5,5,4,3,"Because we stayed at Trump on weekdays, we were able to stay at a much more affordable price compared to staying over the weekend. When we were checking in, the front desk was very generous and upgraded us to a corner suite instead of the regular suite.

The main lobby is simply beautiful, with gold decor, crystal clear chandeliers, and pretty flowers. The main restaurant is on one side of the lobby, across from the check-in counter, and the main walkway leads you to the elevators.

What's great (or not great, depending on your preference) about Trump Hotel is that it doesn't have a casino. The casinos are nearby (such as Wynn, Encore, etc.) but Trump Hotel stands out in that it doesn't own their own casino. Hubby and I personally liked this, because it made the hotel feel like a real luxury hotel, and also family-friendly. There was no cigarette/tobacco smell in the air, the children didn't need to walk through gambling headquarters, and overall, the hotel seemed more high-class.

What hubby and I both found very interesting was how there were another set of doors that led us to our hotel suite. I believe this is only for suites; at least that's how it's listed on the hotel's website. You know how there is a separate Do not Disturb sign that you can hang on your room's main door? At Trump, this was totally not the case. As you can see above, there are two lights that can come up: Housekeeping and Do not Disturb. Inside your hotel room, you can manage these settings and ask for privacy or housekeeping at your leisure. I found this very easy to use and quite efficient; you'd never lose the Do not Disturb sign because it's already built in! The technology also brings a sense of luxuriousness as well.

Because it was a corner suite, it was a bit bigger than the traditional one bedroom suites. The entire suite had a traditional classic feel to it with modern decor that made the suite feel very chic and beautiful.

What we also really appreciated was the kitchen that the suite came with. Many of Trump's hotels are actually residences as well, so for those with extended stays, this kitchen will become extremely useful. Though it was not fully furnished with cutlery, plates, and etc. it was stated that it could be furnished to your desire upon request. All the appliances were high quality and top-notch, from brands such as Bosch, Wolf, and Sub-Zero. We didn't use the kitchen during our stay, but hubby and I both agreed that it would be very handy and useful if we were travelling with a newborn; sometimes finding a place to prepare your baby's milk and food can be troubling! No problem here at Trump Hotel though.

Aside from the kitchen, the bottled water and coffee available in the room were complimentary. Both the water and coffee are unlimited at Trump Hotel, as they are covered in your mandatory resort fee. When requested, the hotel will bring you more water/coffee at your service. The resort fee, which is $32.48 USD/night is a little more pricey than your other Las Vegas hotels and resorts, but it includes many more services for the price, including: valet parking, in-room coffee, in-room bottled water, shuttle service, pool access, fitness centre access, internet access, newspaper, phone calls, faxes, and other additional services.

In between the kitchen and the living room was two doors: one leading us to our bedroom and another leading us to the second bathroom. This bathroom was separate from the bathroom in our master bedroom. The second bathroom was fully equipped with a shower stall ready for use. The marble floors were amazing and so luxurious, and everything was so clean! I didn't know that the suites came with two bathrooms, but I was very grateful that we did!

When hubby and I stepped into our bedroom, we were so surprised by many things, and here are just some of them:
(1) the beautiful master bathroom
(2) floor-to-ceiling windows that gave us a phenomenal view of The Strip
(3) comfortable King bed - comfortable is an understatement
(4) the high-quality closets.

Our stay at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was quite short (only 2 nights), but they were some of the best times we've had during our summer vacation. Everything we needed was already available or only one phone call away. We loved our stay at Trump Hotel and would come back here in a heart beat. If you're looking for a top quality hotel, or a hotel without a casino, Trump International Hotel Las Vegas will be for you!",2015-06-22 23:40:44

I may give this place another try if I am in the area. However, I have generally come to the conclusion that I personally don't like ""modern"" takes on ethnic food. Usually ethnic food is so amazing that it doesn't need to be dressed up, or doled out in small portions on fancy plates.

Food: The guacamole with goat cheese was by far the best guacamole that I've had. Unfortunately, the taquitos were nothing special. Our table got the pork belly, wild boar, beef brisket, and shrimp taquitos. They all tasted good, but nothing particularly stood out in terms of bold flavor. The protein portions were also a bit small. 

Drinks: The margarita sampler was good. I had the blood orange, pomegranate, and cucumber flavors, which were all refreshing. They accidentally also gave us the red bell pepper, which I didn't care for (thats why I hadn't ordered it to begin with).  The samplers were much larger than I expected - about 6-7 ozs of liquid in each. There was also a fair amount of tequila in each.

Service: Our server was very friendly, and prompt with drink refills. The taquitos didn't come out until about an hour after we had been seated, but we had been warned beforehand that reservations were based on a 2-hr dining experience. It didn't bother us too much because we had the guacamole, margarita sampler, and good company to bide us over.

Ambience: Modern and trendy, but intimate.",2015-10-18 13:35:36

Upon first entering the strange multiple sectioned building with lots of loud colors on the walls, you must enter a cafeteria style line and pick what you would like. Here, you have all kinds of stuff to choose from: greasy chili rellenos (aka cheese sponges), several types of enchiladas, tamales, small chimichangas, flautas and taquitos, rice, beans, tacos, and tostadas. The cost is pretty reasonable for all the food you can get and if you like non authentic greasy Mexican food made with lots of trans fat, this might be an ok deal for you. Once seated, you can obtain more items from the buffet simply by raising a little flag at your table. I will admit, this might just be the best idea ever! You raise this flag and the waiters are standing at your table literally seconds later. If only all restaurants would get on board with this! All in all, Panchos is an alright spot for a large unhealthy meal. The service is always good thanks to the flag system and it actually seems like a fairly clean restaurant. Also, who can resist fresh hot sopapillas after your meal? I know I can't, which is why I reluctantly agree to go to Panchos when the hubby asks (he loves those cheese sponges).",2012-01-06 03:45:50

Perhaps because of the music (it's killer, but really, really loud. Huh? I said it's LOUD). Or the venue (it's hidden and indiscriminate). Or the crowd (hip, trendy, and fun with a side of self-entitlement). Or the atmosphere (it's dark and sexy). Or the chef (Hello Chuck Hughes. That's right, chefs are the rockstars of my generation). But shouldn't it be about the food (here I go)?


 
Bread n' butter? 
Nope, Bread and delicious salmon spread 



You absolutely need to make a reservation. My sister and I got the 9:30 seating and thought it'd be great to start with a stiff drink. The daily cocktail was tequila, and although I swore off this ish after 'TequilaGate' Whistler 1998, I threw one back. C'est la vie. It was a fresh grapefruit and soda cocktail that packed a mean punch.


Of the three dishes we ordered, I must have picked two bad ones because my sister was here a few nights ago and she liked it. Don't worry Chef, it happens to many men, it is normal, and it's okay. Or is it me? After all, I ordered.

The beef tartar was good, but there was way too much. I wouldn't normally complain about quantity, but when the tartar is big chunks, after a while, even the biggest carnivore starts to feel cannibalistic. 
 
That's a lot of raw beef... 

My second choice was the wreckfish (since Hughes is known for his seafood). I didn't like it. It may be that I wasn't picking up what he was putting down?!? 

The dish is still pretty, init? 

The night's saving grace was the jerk crab. It was delicious and messy. Oooh, I want to do it again. So yes, I will go back but this time, I won't be ordering. Until then, don't worry Chuck Hughes, I still like youghes.",2011-08-31 14:55:37

Service was a bit slow and scattered-brained - and one of the servers was wearing strong perfume, so every time she walked by I had to hold my breath - a pretty standard ""no-no"" in the restaurant business, maybe one of her co-workers or managers wants to inform of this generally adopted rule.  

I ordered the O&B Breakfast, and when the plate came, I felt a little disappointed at the amount of food.  But my opinion quickly changed.

I love to support local businesses but this was an awful experience.  Heard great things about their salt and pepper wings...horrible. Like fried chicken.  No taste. Took us 45 mins to get our food. Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant. The other people were just in the bar drinking. Chips were extra after the first basket. Really???  The wings my hubby ordered were burnt.  The server didn't know it was happy hour all day so we got overcharged on the drinks. Do not go here.  It isn't worth your Money or your time.


UPDATE: since they are locally owned I messaged them on Facebook to let them know how disappointing it was. I know I would want to know if it was my business. The GM Jon got back with me within an hour or two and said to come back and try them again and it would be on the house. So I will try again and update. Hoping for a different outcome

The dining room is tiny.  There were between six or eight tables.  They also had two tables outside on the ""patio"" overlooking the street.   When we entered, they asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't, but thankfully they had room for us.  We were in a corner next to the window which was nice because it gave us more space than some of the tables in the back near where the restrooms are.

We started with appetizers.  I had the thai toast and my husband the thom Kha soup.  The thai toast was seasoned perfectly and was a larger portion then you get at many places.  The cucumber sauce condiment was so tasty I asked for extra.  The Thom Kha was a perfect balance of spice and sweet and we liked it so much it was tempting to lick to bowl to get every last drop.

My husband had the drunken noodles and I had the pad thai (although it was tough to make a decision because everything seemed so appealing.  The food was cooked to perfection just to the desired spice level we requested.  The portions were large and there was a lot of meat.  

The service was attentive but not in your face.  They were accomodating to requests and kept our water glasses full.

Worst part - they are still remodeling and have taken out the water fountain (replaced it a water cooler, so you need a cup but they are not provided) and taken out the area where you stretch.

The place was busy, but not packed.

Next, we found an old school Capcom Vs Marvel game that took our credits, and didn't let us play. My partner went to the check in desk and they refunded the credits. Cool. Then we went to a few other games, and most of those would do the same. I started paying attention and saw that it was happening to others, too. 

After getting frustrated, we found our friend and her son and played a bit with him (some of those kid games are even more fun than the arcade games). The ticket redemption area was a madhouse, as to be expected, but the staff was friendly enough. The trainer could have been more helpful with his trainee, but he was preoccupied with chatting with his coworkers, who found it appropriate to flip one another off in front of small children (but at least the coworker had enough tact to discreetly disguise it as pushing up his glasses).

Was excited to try Bouchon as a Thomas Keller fan.  To be upfront, Bouchon is no French Laundry.  The latter blew me away whereas, Bouchon was excellent but unremarkable.  

I had the chicken and waffles, which were superb and the waffles threw me for a happy loop with the bacon specks cooked in and the flavored butter.  Other folks in our family had rave reviews for the Tartine de Thon, Bouchon French Toast, and trout dish.  Gravlax and Croque de Madame were said to be good.

Service staff was very nice, though remarkably slow in their execution.

Couple criticisms: 
(1) Service was exceptionally slow!  Ordering took about 25 minutes.  It was about 50 minutes before food was on the table.  And paying was the equivalent of a race with your chunky buddy on your back.  All in all, our dining experience took about 2.5 hours.  
(2) The Bouchon Pastry Basket was grocery store caliber.  Two of the flavors came back as unavailable.  Then, when the platter did arrive, they all had cold centers.  Seriously, for $13 for four pastries, I would expect thorough reheating.
(3) We sat in the back right and with things taking so long, the sun was hitting us hard.  My cousin and I started eating lunch with our sunglasses on.  As the temperature on my phone crossed 90-degrees, I called over the staff and asked to either move or have them pull some kind of shade.  They kindly put an outside umbrella against the window which helped greatly.  They were very kind in responding.  I would have liked it more if they had thought ahead reacted to our discomfort without being asked.  We aren't the only ones who have eaten at the table.

One small problem. 
You're not a cowboy, which is why you're knee-deep in the midst of a sex-draught. 
Well let's change all that, shall we?

Get down to Saba's western wear in Scottsdale and pick yourself out a cowboy getup, making sure to get a pair of tight fitting Wranglers that'll telegraph your business. 
Another problem.
You're running a small business and not a major corporation. That's ok. 
That's what the good lord made gym socks for. Roll one up, and stuff it inside your boxers. 
Hmmm. 
That's not going to get anyone's attention. Better roll the other one up too. 

Ok, now you're ready.

Order the bbq meal. A full pound of tasty meat with all the fixins for 11 bucks. 
Showtime.
Sit at one of the tables next to the fire pit where everyone can see you.

Next, begin wolfing your food as though you've been on a cattle drive for the last month and haven't eaten anything but jerky and corn nuts. 
Don't come up for air. 
Be angry. Get mad at that bbq...wolf it down man. 
Quick, sop up those beans with your bread, making sure to slop it all over your mug. 
Now wash it down with some hot coffee you threw an ice cube in when no-one was looking. 
Drink the entire cup in one gulp. This will impress any onlookers.
Now, lick your lips, wipe your face with your sleeve, and make some loud noise like ahhhhhh. 

Then, start looking around to see if any of the beautiful women in this place are watching your shit-show, hoping at least one of them is about to slide off her seat.  
Time to rope a filly, bud. 

Uh-oh. 
Burrrrpp.  
I forgot. 
You don't drink twelve beers at a time do you? 
Quick, run for the bathroom to throw up before anyone sees you. 
Shit. You forgot the socks. Hoist up the socks man.
Too late.
One just slid down your pant leg and into the well-lit dance floor for all to see. 
Now the other too.
Don't look back man, git to the crapper...fast. 

God you're pathetic.
But I will give you props for at least trying. 
Now wipe that puke and beans off your mug, and head back to the Rover...it's high time you skidaddled outa this place.

mgLE6y-5z6id2ZfUL84MaQ,eRDWzHCldd6YXypRECvHYg,7HrCELR6uv2HkgL7aT_hcQ,3,4,0,0,"I went to Chiado for lunch today and I was impressed by the food and ambiance. Sadly however, I remember little else than the lackluster service now that I am back at home thinking back to my lunch experience. My 7 friends and I were shocked by the service we received. We had heard such amazing things about the service at Chiado, that we were left speechless by the attitude we felt by the staff. Maybe a lot of it had to do with miscommunication, but it certainly could have been handled differently.  

8 of us went to Chiado for lunch today to try their Winterlicious menu. When we arrived the first feeling I got was that they were under-staffed. The staff seemed to be rushing about and acting very clipped and abrupt. They weren't necessarily being rude, but they were not being friendly either. But we were okay with it. We understood that things get pretty busy during Winterlicious and the staff can get overwhelmed. That's ok.  

We were all able to order very quickly and the food did not take long to arrive. I had the grilled squid and it was spectacular. My friends had the bisque and salmon tartar and they loved it too. For my main I had the salmon, and loved the crust on the salmon and the array of vegetables that came with it. We ordered pretty much every main dish in the menu and everyone cleared their plate. The desserts were small, but very beautifully presented and packed with flavor. Again, we cleared our plates.  We loved our meal. 

And then it all went down hill from here....

1 person in our party had ordered a glass of wine, one had a sprite and 2 had coffees. We received the bill and we were charged for 2 glasses of wine, so my friend asked for the correction to be made. No problem. Then we all calculated our totals, and had to call our waiter over several times to ask questions (how much tip were we being charged for example), but getting our waiter's attention was like pulling teeth. He was always around us, but just seemed to not be able to see us. I had to raise my voice to have him come over with a machine so we could take care of the bill. We all added more than 18% to the tip because we really did like the food. When we thought the bill had been settled, the waiter came over to our table and made an ""announcement"" that our bill was short by a few dollars. ""Odd"" we said, ""we all put more than 18% in tip."" So we did the math again and could not figure out where we went wrong. So we called the waiter over and requested the bill. The waiter then proceeded to tell us again that we were short. ""We know."" I said. ""But we want to see the bill."" I felt like I would have to get up and physically go grab the bill myself by the way he seemed to stall. But eventually he brought the bill. He then proceeded to condescendingly break down the bill. A friend of mine grabbed the bill and noticed that we were charged approximately $18 for the water. Huh? It turns out that we had 2 bottles of water that cost approximately $7.50 each. We wanted tap water, but instead we got bottled water. We could care less about bottled water. It tasted like tap water to us. But my friend acknowledged that she was asked when she arrived (she was first to arrive) if the table would want sparkling or still water. She said still. She figured still water was tap water. Well, apparently not. Every restaurant we have ever been to, we have been given the choice between ""tap"" water and bottled water. Even as we realized why there was a discrepancy in the bill and were telling the waiter that now we understood why we were short, he was still repeating that we were short.  We were trying to acknowledge that we made the error of not accounting for the water but he continued to speak over us and telling us that we were short. This whole situation could have been handled differently. The minute we learned of the water, we took care of it. We did not complain about the water or the cost. We never said we wanted ""tap"" water, so the responsibility was on us to be more clear. But the way our waiter spoke to us; it was not very professional.

So, would I return to Chiado? The food was amazing. But the service killed my entire experience. During lunch I was already thinking of all the people I wanted to bring here over the next few months. By the time I was putting on my coat, I wanted to get the hell out of there. It was such a disappointing end to what could have been an amazing lunch.",2014-02-08 21:18:41

We came back as we had a near perfect $400 dinner last year for our 45th wedding anniversary. Unfortunately this year was not a repeat.   Here is the blow by blow...
1. My wife discovered the bathroom had no soap... mind you this was at first opening. 
2. Service.  We were the first table seated, and was done so immediately at opening. Water and menus presented at seating.  After that the waiter disappeared for an extended time. Other guests had their orders taken quickly. In terms of service, our entrees came out about 20 minutes behind other guests... remember, we were literally the first ones seated. I finally had to ask about the status? Generically, the attention vs last year was night and day different.
3. Food: my wife had a Parmesan chicken dish., like last year. Presentation was AMAZING. It came with a lemon cream sauce, but the chicken was literally floating in it. She asked for a separate plate to drain off the excess.  The lemon was also a bit overpowering.  Last year I had the filet, but asked for a recommendation on the rib eye. He recommended a dry aged one. It was cooked nicely, but was a bit tough. Personally, I would stick with the filet. I also had the lobster tail, which was delicious, but at $85 was shockingly small. Independently, my wife observed how small it was...seemed at least 1/3 smaller than last year, and more expensive!!!
4. Lastly, my only issue last year, was the refill on a very small coke was another $5 like the first glass..... for 25 cents of soda, you are going to charge me ANOTHER $5? Restaurant responded here last year that they would address with management... I checked... still $5 for a refill.... on a $300 dinner...?? Waiter agreed it did not make sense.

There was this cool display which was kind of like a 3D presentation where there were three characters on a screen that spoke to you about their lives in the old days. I thought it was really cool. There were some mineral and gemstone displays but not much. I wished they had more to be honest because that was my biggest interest.

This place is best visited when dying of hunger and more or less drunk.

Because let me tell you, you're going to be one of 6 groups of SO HUNGRY, SO DRUNK people there. You'll meet interesting people, hear interesting conversations, maybe meet some not so interesting people who are drunk and trying to hit on your group of friends.

In addition to that, you get a coffee or tea for free, $0.75 extra for a cold beverage, $0.75 extra for change to instant noodles and $0.50 extra for toasted bread. 

We honestly waited like 2 minutes for our drinks to come after we ordered and like less than a minute after, the food came. The food wasn't very hot, it felt like they prepared all of this already and just scooped it from a mildly warm area, but bonus for the speed it is served at.

The beef satay didn't have enough satay in it, I feel. In addition, the soup wasn't hot, just warm. The toast, was not toasted, as you would need to pay an extra $0.50 for toasted bread...which is a little extra. The egg with ham was literally a scrambeled egg mixed with small ham slices.

I will say though, that you should try the fries atleast once. Any time a friend from out of town heads to my place in Oakland, we usually head to The O.

I really don't mind the concept of cafeteria style and using the swipe card to tally your bill. It's the waiting in line I loathe. So, it was probably a mistake to come here on a Friday night at 8pm... it was PACKED. I waited in line over 10 minutes just to order a salad. Okay, so not too crazy, but my boyfriend was in the pasta line ordering for both of us, it had to have been at least 25 minutes. I was pretty pissed at the restaurant at this point, having to wait by myself at our table.

On a positive note, this atmosphere is super cool. I love the decor, chalk board art, trees, red accents. And even though the wait was extremely too long, the food was delish!  Pasta is made fresh daily. I ordered PESTO E SPINACI, very very good. My favorite however was the STRAWBERRY SPINACH SALAD. I'm all about the FCN salads (fruit, cheese, nut)! I highly recommend this salad to anyone! 

We ordered the BRUSCHETTA TRIO as an appetizer, very good. Super hearty bread, fresh tomatoes, and fresh shaved cheese. You definitely get a good deal for the quality of the food.

It was choice between Tim Hortons and Ontario, 9 times out of ten, i will always go with the low key restaurants to see what theyre are working with.

I went into the diner and it was a nice old school look.  Order the hungry/big breakfast entails 2 eggs, 2 bacons strips, 2 sausages, 2 slices of bread, side of home fries(opt for french fries instead) and 2 pancakes all this for $10.95.

Server was pretty quick to take my order and provided me a glass of water with ice and a as well dropped a pitcher of water with ice.  VERY NICE i really do appreciate having bottomless water available on my table.  Bang Extra star for that.

Overall the food was great, the fries tasted a lil bit on the old fryer oil wise maybe they hD to change the oil on the fryer.  The pancakes were amazing tasted nice and crispy.

The white meat was a tad dryer than I would have liked though. Yesterday had the collard greens side and today the yummy stuffing that seems to be made of even more chicken. (!!)

I came in and found them right away, and for $10 they are a steal. They feel very sturdy and honestly I almost like them more than my other pair that broke!

They mainly serve Italian dishes like Arancino, Risotto , pasta and pizza etc. They have a nice selection of classical and more out of the box options to choose from. 

Pricing wise, it is very reasonable, especially with consideration to the fact that the portion sizes are great and the quality of the food and service is there. Our server was friendly and attentive to ensure that we had everything we needed. 

The decor inside is casual but still very pretty  with high ceilings, exposed brick and chandeliers. Great for a date , for groups or for families.The only thing was that for such a big space they do try to have as much seating as possible, so while it doesnt feel crowded in when you're sitting down at your table, it can be tough to circulate through some section. we did get our chairs bumped into more than a few times by some of the other guests. (Keeping in mind that this is a small detail and did not ruin the overall experience)

I had a peach bellini that was absolutely delicious , not too sweet and so refreshing ! Their veal poutine is a great choice , tender braised veal and their own spin on the gravy , so well spiced with lots of stretchy tasty cheese and perfectly cooked fries. The flavour was great but not overpowering so you can enjoy every bite to the end without being overhwhelmed.  And of course , a pizza addict like me couldn't come to Bevo and NOT try one of their pizzas! I had the Formaggio Di Capra E Spinaci (goat cheese, spinach, tomato sauce& sun dried tomato). The dough was nice and thin ,cooked in a wood oven, it had great texture flavour, and a great balance of all the delicious toppings!

They offer many plates with interesting ingredient combinations of all kinds and a wide selection of different proteins for dinner that includes different fish options. 

I noticed a charge on the menu for chips and salsa but depending on what you order the fee is waved as we didn't ask for chips and salsa but they were given to us. I do note the chips were thin and hot and fresh and seemed free of grease. The one smooth tomato salsa was very hot and the other salsa was chunky and very smokey.

One of the MOST DELICIOUS THINGS I TRIED THIS YEAR was the Huitlacohe crepas from here.  For those who are unfamiliar with Huitiacohe it's considered to be a delicacy and grows on sick corn and is also called a Mexican Truffle. BUT I DO NOTE the crepes had so many flavors and textures in them I didn't recognize the Huitlacohe in them and I had Huitlacohe in Mexico a bunch of times and here in the valley a few times so I know what to look for. But the crepes were so delicious it doesn't matter to me. The lightly buttered thin perfect crepes with tasty fresh sweet corn, just the right amount of blue and goat cheese fot the right amount of tang and salt. Maybe the huitiacohe was part of the magic to the blend of flavors. Chewy cranberries and that drizzle of pomegranate sauce It was so good I will have a difficult time to come here and not order it again. Honestly I could enjoy this plate as a dessert because it did have some sweetness to it. I think it could be an EXCELLENT dessert plate.

I had trout like I never had it before. For one thing the portion was very large and I had to take half of it home. The fish was in a familiar lemon butter with capers sauce but it was topped with pickled cauliflower salad with almonds and caramelized onions. It was very unusual. I really enjoyed the side vegetables as they were so fresh and cooked but crispy and cut the right size for eating easily. The mixed vegetables had a surprise of crunchy chayote squash in them that livened them up. The side of rice was seasoned in a very tasty way too.

My companion had the Pork Chipotle and he said it was moist and very flavorful he enjoyed it very much.

I noticed they have a nice patio but in the 110 degree weather it's too hot to sit outside so we had to dine indoors. The inside is somewhat small and crammed. The few small normal tables were already occupied so we had to sit at a high top table. That really is the only thing I didn't care for since I'm only five foot zero i have to leap up and try to land on the sliding cushion and some how rock the chair to push it in.

They currently have a lunch special for $9 (tax included) for about 6-8 items. We also looked at their regular menu, and comparing to their ""regular prices"" to their competitors, they were on the more pricier side. But my friend and I opted for the lunch specials. My friend got the glass noodles (normal sized portion) and I ordered pork bone soup with rice cakes (instead of just rice). 

The rice cakes in the pork bone soup was a pleasant surprise. I liked it much better than just plain rice 

Overall, I thought the god tasted good and the prices (due to lunch specials only) was decent and the place was spacious and clean. 

I'd give it 3.5 stars

I've been putting off ""me time"" shopping for a long time now. Mostly because we were in the midst of saving for the house and now that I am not working. I didn't think it should be a priority. When I was still employed, there were a handful of items that I wanted/needed...more like wanted to purchase before I stop receiving a paycheck. 

Only because D told me to get out of the house and enjoy the afternoon shopping, I accepted. I thought I'd window shop but actually picked up a few tops and accessories. Still need a few more items (jacket, handbag, shoes, etc) but that's on hold until next month. :) 

I checked out the Chandler Fashion Center which is ranked as one of the top retail destinations out here. Of course, it follows Fashion Square at Scottsdale and Biltmore Fashion Park. After living in Newport Beach, CA surrounded by the top retail destinations of Southern California, I found myself a bit spoiled by the luxury. So reality hit me this afternoon when I pulled up to the Mall. This mall did not meet my expectations as I assumed it could. I was hoping to see more designer shops to compare it to some of the CA malls. It felt short of that expectation. But it was not a complete loss. They had the standard shops like The Loft, Guess, Nordstroms, Arden B, Aldo, etc. which is great for the Diva on a budget. It was the equivalent of the Burbank Mall or the Glendale Galleria minus the Urban Outfitters and some others. I guess if I wanted bourgeois I could trek up to Scottsdale or Phoenix.

They didn't highlight that it is also much more cramped, messy, run-down, and in other ways inferior to the other WInners.  The location is convenient, but so what if you're unlikely to find something to buy and have an uncomfortable time hunting.  The whole reason to go a Winners is the hunt, the chance that you'll find a treasure that you wanted to buy anyway, but at a lower price.  Seems less likely here and so I'll probably not bother to come back.

And as Christine has pointed out, though the place sells the same sort of second-rate merchandise as its brethren stateside (Ross, TJMaxx, Home Goods, Marshall's, etc.), the prices are consistently higher.  But the difference matches the price difference in retail prices.  It's just that Canadian retail prices are typically 20-40% higher than US prices, so if you're saving 30% off Canadian retail prices it may still be more expensive than normal retail in the US.  That's only a consideration if shopping in the US is an option for you.

But, unfortunately, their earliest reservation was 10:30 pm, so District One became plan B. Serendipitously, we were just in time to catch the tail end of happy hour. The happy hour menu features some great appetizers at 30-40% off. We started off with the fish tacos, beef carpaccio, belly buns, spring rolls, a half dozen fresh oysters, and the garlic fries to start. Of those, I really enjoyed the fish tacos and beef carpaccio. The fish tacos featured yellowtail sashimi and a lot of acid (serrano pepper, cherry tomato) wrapped in a crispy taco shell. It was an interesting take on a not so taco Tuesday fish taco. The Vietnamese beef carpaccio was the most flavorful dish of the bunch. The thinly-sliced beef was just ever-so-slightly seared and mixed with lime juice, peanuts, and onions for the most flavorful carpaccio I've had. The belly buns were their featured braised pork belly. The pork belly was very tender and the buns were perfect (I've had a lot of shitty buns), but I didn't get too much flavor. The spring rolls and garlic fries were standard fillers. The fresh oysters were huge (not the typical small, sweet ones you find) and worth a try. 

As for the entrees, we were quite full from the happy hour appetizers, so we decided to split two dishes. We had to get the popular oxtail fried rice. This dish is as amazing as everyone says. The fried rice is nicely seasoned and the ox tail meat is flavored well although some portions are more fibrous than expected. No fried rice is complete without a sunny side up egg to top it off. The other dish we tried was the crispy bird nest noodle. I liked most of the food up until this point, but this noodle dish was just plain awful. It was so salty and the combination of stir-fried beef, fish balls, and shrimp made no sense. The flavors of sweet, savory, and mostly just salt made it unpalatable. The noodles were also completely fried instead of having the outside crispy and the inside soft as it traditionally is. This disaster dish aside, I liked the overall menu and atmosphere. Happy hour beers are $3-4 so check out happy hour 5:00 to 7:00 pm or reverse happy hour 12:00 to 3:00 am.",2015-08-20 04:29:15

It did not disappoint and was a great value. 
I will say that the parking situation at this restaurant can be a little tricky so allow time to find a spot. I was quickly seated in a large booth and my drink order was taken promptly.  I did end up ordering the lobster roll with chips with a side of ranch dressing.  It was great! I would eat it again.  The crab meat was all claw meat and boy there was plenty of it. It was served on a toasted butter roll on top of shredded lettuce. The home made chips were nice and crisp with a little bit of seasoning to jazz them up.  My meal was wonderful. The sandwich is more expensive than I'd like to pay for a sandwich but I have to remember that it's covered in a lobster.  Lobster isn't cheap so $17 for a lobster roll and sandwich isn't a bad deal in my opinion.  The food was great and so was the service. I will be returning to this location.

DB5lOvZkypulpEeh5IqnBw,HFFiM63x9asevqVOZG5GBQ,2pOE6yvSNjJ7RNV5in_nLg,5,0,0,0,"We love noshing at this traditional Greek restaurant located in the bustling little lake town of Cornelius whenever we have the opportunity. Although its interior is somewhat dated (okay, a lot dated), the food is always excellent and plentiful. As is the case with most Greek restaurants, the menu is huge and everything we've tried over the last 10 years had proven to be very flavorful and satisfying. Supersized portions also easily provide lunch the following day, which is always a huge plus in my book. 

My favorite dish is simply the chicken parm served with perfectly cooked spaghetti. Their marinara sauce is vividly delicious - thick, chunky, slightly sweet and cooked to the perfect consistency. My wife's favorite is the Chicken Athenos which is grilled chicken, with spinach, feta cheese and diced tomatoes in a light white garlicy sauce over rice pilaf (so savory, that my mouth waters just writing about it.) They also serve as an occasional special, Seafood Diablo. When available, get it! It is shrimp, scallops, fish and squid in a spicy light red sauce. Fabulous!

Most entrees are served with perfectly constructed ""side"" salads (which are really too big to be your run-of-the-mill side salad) accompanied by their made in house dressings. Bread is also included but is nothing special; the iced tea however is. Served in 32 ounce glasses with good sized lemon wedges, it is indeed southern which means it is sweet (or is as sweet as you want it) and makes the typical restaurant price of $1.95 for teas almost justifiable, especially if you leave with a cup to go without ice (and trust me... I always do!)

I know too well that the desserts strategically calling to you behind the glass displays as you walk in is an old Greek trick to entice you to indulge, yet I happily fall for it everyone (and I dare you not to.) Usually included are several cheese cakes, coconut cake, tiramisu, chocolate cake, canoles and eclairs. All are made in house and are reasonably priced (another Greek trick that makes avoiding them impossible.) Just as challenging are the clear boxes of confectionary sugar  topped wedding cookies that beckon in the windowed display at the checkout counter. Yep, you may have guessed it... we bring home a couple of those too.

Service has always been good to excellent for us and we have never experienced any of the occasional surliness that I have read about in a handful of other reviews. Sanitary rating is always in mid-90's like we require.

TIP: Not that you need any additional incentive or enticement, but they also happily accept Go-Play-Save Bogo Free coupons as of this writing.

In summary, we love this place but, thankfully, we don't live closer as it is definitely a diet and cholesterol buster.",2016-10-17 13:25:37

Despite the great location and the vast space of this Costco it always seems to be packed no matter when you go and finding parking is always a hassle. Also- their customer service is horrendous.

I have seen cashiers yell and insult customers. I have seen workers get upset with customers over trivial things. A man came in with his wife's card and they treated him like a criminal- even though he explained that he didn't know he couldn't use her card.

Whenever you ask for help they treat you like they're too busy (almost like saying: ""we have too much going on right now and we cannot handle it, so I can't help you"") quite frankly I find it really sad- and they know they can get away with it because people go anyway,  I mean come on, it's Costco!

They charged me my renewal fee twice in the span of a month! I went in person and brought my account information and spoke to customer service, the girl at customer service made a note of everything and let me know that in a few days a manager would contact me. After two weeks of waiting I called customer service myself again and asked to speak directly to a manager. 

I had to explain the entire situation again because nothing was written down and no notes were made!

The manager then assured me that the person in charge would contact me and set up a return.

Again I waited another week and called that person directly. That person who is in charge of making sure that everything balances at the end of the day told me that there were no notes made and that they had no idea what I was calling about. Again I had to re-explain my situation!!!

Their final suggestion was that I make a print out from my bank showing proof that they charged me twice and bring it in. I am now in the process of getting this done but the fact that I had to go through so much waiting and that their internal management has such miscommunication problems is very concerning!!

This location is especially dingy and tired looking and also a little tough to find if you've never been before.

This is no Mike and Tony's or big greek gyro in Market square.  I won't be back.  They only take cash. The workers are not Greek chefs and are very condescending.

I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh!   I had to hunt silverware and straws.  You would think they would give them to you with the meal.  

They charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.

Pei Wei is an intriguing place to me as it falls (as many have stated in other reviews) kind of in between Panda Express and PF Changs. I feel that the concept is there, however the execution could be better. They seem to be doing well though as they were pretty packed today (Sunday) for a late lunch.
The negative for me is portion size relative to price, especially for their dinner selects specials. We both ordered the specials which include a half portion of an entree and a side item. I chose the Honey Seared Chicken with white rice and my side was Won-Ton Soup. The soup was flavorful but was barely cup size and the entree was pretty good but left me plenty hungry. Worst part was they didn't include a drink so my $6.25 cent meal turned into an $8 meal that left me wanting more.
So, why the 4 stars?? Well, for one I appreciate the concept of this chain and I think they actually make some decent dishes. Seeing as how they are partnered up with PF Changs it makes sense. I wouldn't go as far as to say they are the poor-man's PF Changs, but they might be the middle-class man's PF Changs. The staff was friendly and our order came out right.

They have also certificates on Restaurant.com but I did not purchase one. I definitely have my favorite coffee shops but I am always open to adding another one to the list. I took my daughter with me, along with some children's books to read on a rainy, AZ day. I got myself an sugar-free vanilla nonfat latte and my daughter a kids hot chocolate. I had to repeat my latte order like 3 times to the male employee and after I got it, waited for it to cool down and took a sip, I realized they never added the syrup. Pretty annoying given how many times I had to remind the guy what I ordered as he rung me up. The lady who made my daughter's hot chocolate added whipped cream and chocolate syrup and didn't make it too hot, which I really appreciated. My daughter still ended up spilling it on her white shirt. What I was thinking???? A 3 year old, hot chocolate and a white shirt?? Aahhh, the never-ending lessons of a new mom. Since I forgot to bring a snack for my daughter, I ordered a blueberry muffin for her and a chocolate chip cookie for me. Both were extremely good. The total for the drinks and food were just under $9 which I think is standard. As I looked in the display case, at the food, there was a pretty good variety. As other reviewers mentioned, the chairs are mismatched throughout. I found a table with a comfy chair (all of the other chairs were the standard, hard, wooden) since I planned to have my daughter in my lap as we read. 

Overall, I would say I enoyed my time here (besides the drink mistake). I wish they had some arm chairs or couches or something but maybe they will in the future.

The terrible self proclaimed manager responded ""No you need to get up, they are waiting for the machines.""

I creeped Le Passe Compose really hard before coming and was SO excited to come. Zero disappointment -hands down one of the best brunch spots I have ever been to in my life. I find that a lot of brunch places are overpriced for what they serve. While they serve some standard items here, they also serve some more interesting plates such as the duck confit poached egg I had. It was served with butternut squash, Parmesan, chives, white Porto sauce, and potato waffles. The butternut squash with the egg and duck created such a great explosion of flavours. Also, I'm not a big sauce person but that white porto sauce was A-mazing and I just wish I could bottle it up and bring home a gallon!

I also tried their croque madame (rustic bread, white ham, d'Auvergne cheese, Bechamel sauce, old cheddar, poached egg, arugula and endive salad caramelized with sherry). While I am no connoisseur of croque madames I just know that this was a huge potion of DELICIOUS things coming together.

During which, while Samara my cashier took my order, I observed two individuals in plain clothes walk behind the counter, passed her and three other employees, to what appeared to be the 1st drive thru window.

Whether or not they are current employees bears no bearing to individuals walking through the kitchen who have no pressing business to do so. In the professional environment, perception is huge and this perception is not positive at all.

After having gathered my food, and finished eating it, I observed a gentlemen place and pick up his order, walk towards the restrooms and turned around and placed his food on the counter to walk back to where the first two individuals went to. This lessened my experience that now three plain clothes individuals would casually walk behind the scenes (where my and other patron's food is prepared).

My bf's mom purchased these for a holiday dinner and served them to us. I was afraid she made them herself, but thank goodness they came from elsewhere. 

I really can't understand why anyone would give these 5 stars. Any good dumpling will be plump and stuffed with a delicious filling. It will be freshly made and most importantly, the dough on the outside will not be as thick as my carpet. 

These pierogis- the dough is as thick as my carpet, so if you're not a fan of that, avoid. There's a big fat ring of dough around the whole dumpling, so guess what- they can charge you more by weight and it's not the most costly thing they're made of. Pretty big rip off if you ask me. 

I know of another stand at the West Side market that has way better pierogis but I can't remember the name because it's been a while.

Bread basket - I only ate one slice since I didn't want to ruin my meal, but I thought the bread was average - the butter they served with it was noticeably good, though.

Appetizer - 'Rough Cut Tuna Nachos':  I have no idea what is 'nacho' about this appetizer, but if you like tuna tartare you will love this appetizer.  The capers, the mango puree, the little chips they served to scoop it up with - all super delicious.  The tuna was high quality.

Entree - 'Coffee-Rubbed Filet Mignon' - delicious!  My steak was cooked perfectly, was a great cut of meat, and the coffee and ancho chile on the outside really added a lot of flavor.  This was a big win for me.

Side - 'Fresh Corn Tamale + Jalapeno Pesto Butter' - I was not a fan of this.  The tamale was not very moist, and basically tasted like a plain corn tamale that you would get at any regular Mexican restaurant - I didn't really get any flavor from the jalapeno pesto butter that was on it, either.. I can't believe I paid ten bucks for a crappy plain tamale!  

Dessert - 'Churros' - not so great.  These churros were pretty weak - they were not fluffy, there was no slightly gooey center and crispy outer.  The sauces were also not very good - there was barely any sauce served with the churros (dunking was impossible) and neither of the sauces had strong (or notable) flavor - I would have preferred one small creamer pot of good mexican chocolate for dipping.

Service was very good - our waiter had the right frequency of checking in, and was very tolerant of us being one of the last people in the restaurant.

Really, I want to give Mesa Grill 3 or 3.5 stars because of the inconsistency in quality of dishes across all parts of dinner, but on the strength of the appetizer and main dish, I will go ahead and give them 4 stars..

The gentleman taking my order was very pleasant and helpful since this was my first time here. I got lucky and beat the lunchtime rush.

I ordered the 4 pastor tacos with a drink special for about $6.00+. These mini tacos were so full off pastor and the meat was so flavorful.

It had onions & cilantro and then there was a salsa bar so you have to get the salsa of your liking. There's also a board to help guide you on how hot one is over the other.

Before I even sat down, I was asked by the Dim Sum cart lady if I wanted some. Having never been here, I declined so I could see the menu. 

After five minutes, I'm glad for my decision. The lady offered neighboring tables the same. Her English was so bad that they were utterly confused about what they ordered. 

I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and an iced tea for $12.50. 

I added beef chow mein from another cart lady. 

The flavors of the chow mein were very good, with minimal oil but even less beef. In fact, there was no meat. 

The Kung Pao Chicken, which is a spicy dish, had zero spice aside from the dried peppers that were added at the end. 

My lunch came with a vegetable roll and steamed Gyoza, which were nice touches. The TV was playing judge Judy, which, I guess is what they like here. At least they had a tv!",2017-06-29 00:43:49

The lunch specials are quite a bit more affordable than dinner.  The Pan Seared Fish Filet came with white rice and cooked vegetables ($8).  The 2 pieces of filets were quite thin and they were cooked just right.  The sauce tasted bold.  There was nothing special about the rice and vegetables. If anything, the one thing that stood out was how not oily and how plain the rice and vegetables were.  Not a hint of butter or salt.  It was obvious that this was intentional.  Whether you like this chef interpretation or not is up to you.

I was glad that I added $1 for coffee.  It was strong and bold. It erased my headache in 30 seconds.

Other than the sauce, I can cook this simple dish myself, easily, except I have to make sure the ingredients are just as fresh.

I won't come back again. One of my friends went to PT's on Decatur/Sahara and said after gambling she didn't get comps either. That theme seems to be reoccuring at PT's everywhere....so I guess its time to boycott the corporations who don't treat customers well.",2017-01-28 20:28:08

Last year I attended Zombie Burlesque and it was absolutely terrible, like the worst thing I've ever seen in my life (I did a separate review for that). The friends we were with are HUGE Evil Dead fans and said they had seen this before and that it was worth it, so I trusted them, but continued to secretly fear a zombie burlesque-similar experience. Thank god that didn't happen.

We got a groupon that made the tickets $25 a piece. We opted for the non splatter zone as our friends had been before and said they just kill you with fake blood if you're in it. I wouldn't have minded a little splatter here and there, but I didn't need a bucket kool aide dumped on my head just for kicks. It was a Friday night and the place was empty. The 2 rows of splatter zone were mostly filled, but other than that it was fairly empty so even though we didn't pay for the ""VIP"" seats which were the 2 rows behind the splatter zone, that's where we got to sit without an upcharge...coolness.

The thing was ridiculously campy and that's what it should have been. It was funny without being middle school dick and fart jokes which is what I feared as that is what the zombie burlesque was. The acting was very good, the songs were hilarious, and they worked in all the good Bruce Campbell quotes/lines. The sets and costumes were terrible, but you got the sense that they were ""in on the joke"" and meant to be terrible which added to the fun. Nobody was taking it seriously. At intermission some of the actors came out and talked to the splatter zone audience. A good time was had by all.

I don't think I'd need to go see it again, but I DEFINITELY enjoyed it and would totally recommend it for Evil Dead fans! 

Suggestions: 
-Create themed drinks. At intermission the bar gal came in with blood-looking shots for the splatter zone for free, but she should have been selling those ahead of time in the bar while we were all waiting. Some non-shot drinks that were themed would sell well I think. 
-The location of the theater is shady. I know it used to be in the miracle mile and that would have been much better. Honestly the theater is like down a dark/creepy ally and had we not gone there in the daylight, I wouldn't have really wanted to walk down there at night for the first time. It was dark by the time we came out, but since we had walked in during the day we knew the surroundings...although it was still shady.

I am not personally a fan of this place, I find the meat of poor quality. The food burns easily and the dipping sauce is full of MSG or additives, makes me thirsty afterwards. The service is so-so.

Usually come here for their all you can eat option. I think the ribs is generally the tastiest, the beef depends on the cut, the pork and chicken usually consistent. I find the squid and the fish not the freshest, and sometimes taste ""fishy"", so I generally avoid. I like the Chinese red sausage, but that's probably cause it's full of sodium and random meats. The kimchi side dishes don't taste that great or authentic. The rice is okay and the soup is a mystery to me, I feel like is MSG as well.

DINNER

I have lived in Las Vegas for 7.5 years. I have dined out quite often here, both on and off the Strip & Downtown. (I am not one of those locals that eschews the Strip, I'll go anywhere if it is enticing, and the Strip has been, many times.) I just finished posting all of the details of last night's meal at Sparrow + Wolf on my Facebook. I do not feel I have to do that here. I just came here to say this. Last night this restaurant served me one of the greatest meals I've ever had. And I've had incredible meals in the past, from all around the world. Wolfgang Puck (+Ed LaDou+Mark Peel+Nancy Silverton+...) in LA in 1982 3 weeks after the first Spago opened. Ken Frank at La Toque, in LA in the 1980s as well as Napa Valley in 2005. Pierre Gagnaire in LA in 1998, and in Paris in 2000. Charlie Trotter in Chicago in 1998. Thomas Keller at the French Laundry in 2006. Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park in 2009. And there have been others. And now Brian Howard has been added to my list.

My coworkers and I ordered takeout to bring back to the office. We placed the order online, but my coworker stil waited a few minutes for the order. The staff told him that online orders aren't received by the restaurant until 10 minutes before pick-up time. Bad news...this means you'll wait even if ordering ahead of time. Good news....the food was freshly prepared and still hot when it arrived back at the office.

Pretty much all of us ordered the Sin City Burger and Smash Fries. The Sin City Burger had a nice sized beef patty, American cheese, egg, crispy bacon, grilled onions, and smash sauce. It was a great combination of ingredients and tasted great. The burger had plenty of the mentioned ingredients, but was still fairly easy to eat. I hate when a burger is overloaded to the point that you end up eating each ingredient separately. The Smash Fries had a nice herb flavor and were very crispy.",2016-05-21 15:01:39

After cocktails at the bar, which were decent, we were seated at our table. I hate to make generalizations, but this place reminded me of someplace from back in the 60's. It seemed old, with music from the 50's and 60's playing in the background. 
I started out with 2 appetizers - the gulf oysters (5.95) and the escargot (5.95). Oysters were supposed to be 80 cents each, yet I was charged the $5.95 for a half dozen. I don't mind paying the price for a good oyster, but these were not plump or very tasty. I had to really doctor them up with a bunch of horseradish and Tabasco sauce. The escargot were nicely cooked and served with a nice piece of Parmesan bread, but here again, the menu calls them Large, Meaty Snails in Garlic Butter, but what I got were anything but large, though they were, to be fair, very tasty. One of my companions got the pecan shrimp (5.95) and said they were o.k. while another companion had the calamari, which she pronounced was pre-frozen and off tasting. To it's credit, the restaurant took it off the bill.
I had the seafood gumbo supreme (13.95), which had shrimp, bay scallops, oysters and one small crab claw in it. For me, the gumbo did not have the kind of seasoning that one would expect to be in a real gumbo, and again, I ended up doctoring it up a lot to make it suit my tastes. After doctoring it, the taste was fine, though the crab claw was definitely not fresh and tasted off. I ended up placing it on a plate on the side and abandoning it there. The meal also came with a cup (they call it a bowl) of soup. I elected to have the clam chowder. To their credit, the clams were nice sized and not overcooked, but on the down side, the broth was a bit thin and watery.
Other companions had seafood d'Orleans (12.95), Cajun sampler (11.95), and Cajun jambalaya (12.95). Comments made by our companion from New Orleans,was that it tasted exactly like Zatarains and they would be surprised if it wasn't. Other companions mentioned that the food lacked seasoning and seemed quite bland to them.
Sanitation was, unfortunately, not up to quality standards. While the tableware and table were clean, none of the tables in the room were cleared while we were there. The dirty dishes were left on the tables from their ""Early Bird"" diners. While we were there, no other diners entered the restaurant, so I would have to assume the dirty dishes were there for at least and hour and a half or more, waiting to be cleared.
The restroom was clean and mostly stocked.
In all, I would say that this was a bit of a disappointment. Serving previously frozen food does nothing to help a restaurant gain customers, nor does serving food that is off do much. Two stars.",2013-10-06 04:17:10

I am a fan now because all the raves are all so true!! The restaurant is a huge location and can seat large parties. This place is quite popular during happy hour, weekend, and watching sports! Parking can be a struggle but it's all good. The food is worth fighting for a parking space.  

This is a good place for Vietnamese fusion and are well known for serving lobster PHO!! Presentation makes me drool but I heard it's doesn't taste as good as it looks after finding out you are paying lobster the market place between  $35-45!! Lol... Don't get me wrong.. The pho they serve is better than most pho places in Vegas. Just be prepare for the bill.

Other popular dishes are the bone soup, oxtail fried rice, and the oxtail pho. The serving size is enough to feed 2 ppl. Soup is very rich and flavorful!! They are generous with the noodles too. The best part is that the meat is so tender that it easily falls off the bone. Yum!!

But now that Rick Moonen has re-imagined the spot as a steampunk inspired tapas gastropub which is fittingly named, Rx Boiler Room,  I thought it would be worth a try since it's a more casual spot now.  I love what they've done with the place with the steampunk look.

Since their slogan is ""The alchemy of food & drink"", I figured that it would only be right to try at least one of their specialty cocktails.  On their iPad cocktail menu (http://bit.ly/1h8Y1Ru), they all looked and sounded pretty cool.

Smoked Whiskey & Cola -- http://bit.ly/1fsH0RI
George Dickel Tennessee Whiskey, House made Cola Syrup, Bittercube Cherrybark Vanilla Bitters, Fever Tree Soda Water, & Smoked Cherrywood Chips
They call this Jack & Coke's much cooler cousin, and by simply looking at their presentation I can definitely see why.  Let's face it, I only really bought this drink just so I can see the Smoking Skull for the Smoked Whiskey.  It was badass!!  The drink was pretty good though and went well with my meal.

I made a late dinner reservation at Rx Boiler Room at 10pm on a Friday night.  I think one thing that makes this place shine is that it's open really late on the weekends till 2am.  The only thing that was regretting about that late reservation was because it was my second dinner that night and I came in only 50% hungry.  But thankfully Rx Boiler Room's menu has a very diverse selection of plates that can satisfy any type of appetite with a whole array of small plates and some very large plates as well that include thick cut steaks and seafood.  So naturally, I ordered some of their popular small plates that I've seen pics of on yelp that looked and sounded the most interesting.

Rx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells -- http://bit.ly/191AwKs
Kampachi Tartare with Grapefruit
Basically they're mini ceviche tacos.  Pretty pricey, but every bite was so good!

Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg --  http://bit.ly/1c2r1ev
Brioche Toast, Tomato Jam, and Sunny Side Quail Egg.
This is probably their most popular plate and it's pretty obvious why.  I mean it doesn't get any better than bacon wrapped pork belly topped with a quail egg on sweet toasted brioche.  It's ridiculously good!

Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets -- http://bit.ly/191Asup
Tempura Fried filled with Natural Jus and Peas-N-Carrots
I think this is one of their more creative entrees.  No sauce needed with these nuggets because it's all inside!

I ordered a good amount of food and I found myself pretty full after having all these small plates.  If I wasn't so full, I probably would've tried their take on the famous cronut, or coughnut, as its spelled on their menu.

So even though I only tried just a small sample of what Rx Boiler Room had to offer, it was definitely enough to make a fan out of me.  I could probably see myself coming here more often than RM Seafood because it's easily more accessible and inviting with it's casual approach and up my alley as a gastropub with a steampunk setting, great creative food, and interesting cocktails.",2013-12-30 10:07:55

For some reason when my friends and I go to Vegas, we always get something for free at a dining place...last time it was Bouchon, this time it was Brand Steakhouse.

We had reservations at 9pm, which we noted at the end of dinner that the kitchen closes at 10pm (and the bar is open till 2am). When we got there we all ordered the rib-eye, and the kitchen ran out of and asked if we could switch out our steaks to maybe porterhouse or the NY strips. We were really disappointed because our friends come here all the time and swears on their rib-eye. We say okay and the restaurant apologizes and promises to send us free dessert.

Next, my friends who order a porterhouse medium rare and a medium get it both well done. Disappointed, they asked the waiter if they could get another steak, and the restaurant happily comps them 3 free steaks for the mistake (and the previous mistake of not having enough rib-eyes for our group).

The steaks itself and the sides (macaroni, spinach, etc.) were all good but not comparable to Mastro's. I was happy that the restaurant honors itself of being a fine dining restaurant by comping us with free dessert (enough to feed a group of 10+ with barely any leftovers) and comping us 3 free steaks. But if you're a steakhouse, you shouldn't run out of steaks, and shouldn't have overcooked in the first place, but it wasn't comparable to mastro's, so I give it 3 stars.",2011-08-29 06:25:24

We had reservations for 6 on a week night. Of course the table was late, the drinks were slow to arrive and the waiter was really an all-time low. Oddly enough, we are not a hard group to please, but this place is so ridiculously bad, it angered me enough to write.

The food.....terrible. Overpriced and below average with a hefty dose of hipster attitude to try to hide its inadequacy. The waiter explained the charcuterie plate as ""cheese, some special sauce, and of course nuts"". He couldn't suggest an entree and barely understood the difference between red and white wine.

So for $95 a couple we got.....taken advantage of badly. Never again.",2014-12-19 06:07:41

My favorite dish is the Cowboy Platter: 3 eggs cooked any way you like, choice of meat from bacon, sausage, or chorizo (highly recommend), choice of hashbrowns or country potatoes, and toast. It's a pretty hefty dish that satisfies.

Customer service is the one thing that this place is lacking. Previously, I've received excellent service, but the last 2 visits were not so great. The waitress on both occasions were non-engaging and very abrupt. On one of the visits, the waitress flat out ignored my boyfriend and I while she waited on the table RIGHT NEXT TO US and her attitude did a complete 180 any time she went between the 2 tables. We could obviously hear her ask the next table if there was anything she could get for them, going above and beyond, but the minute she turned to help us, she was unfriendly and acted as if taking our order or requests was such a chore. Forget asking for a coffee refill without her eyes rolling to the back of her head! If her attitude was the same across the board it would be no big deal, but she showed obvious disdain for us in particular.

In short, I love the food they serve. But their customer service skills from some of the staff is horrendous.

I'm usually on top of snapping a few photos of everyone dinner plate. However, it was a special night celebrating my brothers bday and I got so excited to try all the dishes, I forgot. I've been on a health kick lately so this was a cheat meal. I must say FAITHFULLY cheated. It was delicious!! My brother enjoyed his dinner, too. That was my biggest mission. He religiously and generously is a high profile high roller in the family who has been to all the top spots around town. So it's hard to server this man a good, GREAT steak. The server suggested a the old aged prime rib! In addition, they brought 3 different house steak sauces to our table. Generally, I never care for the extra sauces but I couldn't resist. You have to try all 3 of them. That's exactly what I got and exactly what I recommend. Any restaurant at the Bellagio is generally a hit. Plan accordingly and treat yourself!

I was hoping with the opening of 2 new studios, the crowds would die down, but I still have to arrive insanely early and be matt to matt with the person next to me.  This may not be a deal breaker for some, but it really ruins the experience for me. The thing that bothers me the most is that you can see them selling single session deals on their website for their most crowded classes.  I can see doing this for the less crowded classes, but it's annoying that they run specials that make a packed class even more crowded.  As seen in most reviews, the front desk staff is either rude or just doesn't seem to care.  I never got a tour, and I had one instance where a minor confusion could've been easily solved yet the front desk staff was just RUDE about the situation.  

The pros: VERY clean and nice facility! I love that! Locker room is modern, and its one of the few gyms/studios I would actually shower at.  The facility itself is 5 star

They have a great variety of instructors.  Some instructors weren't my style, but I could see where other people would like them.  No instructor was ever rude/mean, and they were always engaging. I have friends that go to other studios and have had really bad experiences with instructors, but that wasn't the case here ever.  My 2 fav were Anna and Mindy.

As Hottie and I continue our quest to find a decent Mexican restaurant, again we leave feeling a bit defeated.  Ticoz looked promising; they have a diverse menu with lots of vegetarian options, decent prices, and happy hour. Arriving at about 6PM on a Friday, the parking lot was full, so we took advantage of the complimentary valet.   Although the restaurant was pretty full, we still managed to get sat right away.  Eager to try one of their signature drinks, I asked for a recommendation from the server.  He wasn't particularly helpful, so I just picked what sounded good to me, a lychee mojito.  I should have figured out when they offered so many flavor options for both the mojito's and margaritas, that they would just be adding syrup... and I lot of it!  Let's just say I am not a huge fan of overly sweet cocktails, so I was not a fan of the lychee mojito. Next I tried the signature margarita with no extra ""flavoring"". This was much better but still a little sweet for my taste.  For dinner, we started off with chips and salsa. The chips were good, they were thick cut and prepared fresh, but lacked salt.  The salsa was okay, nothing special, similar to what you find at Baja fresh. Unfortunately we ended up with a handful of extra chips and an empty bowl of salsa... and were not offered a refill.  For dinner I ordered the blue corn enchiladas vegetarian and a side of black beans.  This was by far the best part of the meal. The enchiladas were packed with flavor and not greasy at all. There was just enough cheese to satisfy my cravings, but not make me feel guilty about eating it.  Also, the vegan black beans were sooooo good, not sure what the smoky flavoring was, but I want that recipe!  For dessert we ordered a blonde brownie topped with ice cream.

It's a quaint little cafe with a very hipster vibe from the lighting to the potted plants. They have very interesting combinations for gelato that will catch you off guard, but the way it compels the tastebuds to reconcile with your brain what you just ate in gelato form makes me smile. The ricotta, rosemary & lemon flavour is a must-try. I'll be back to try it's pizza and cafe offerings another time, and of course more gelato.",2017-04-09 05:04:23

Parking, like most plazas in Chinatown is small and compact. We kinda had to stalk a few people to find spots. My friends and I were here on a Saturday evening...pretty close to prime time dinner hours and didn't have to wait for a table. Place was busy too. Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks filled. I wouldn't say the food were over-priced but it's definitely not your typical ""Asian prices."" Visitors from So Cal MIGHT get a sticker shock since we are so used to $6.50 pho and $8.99 HK café rice plates. 

We ordered egg rolls ($6.99), two bowls of chicken pho ($9.99 each) and one of their specials; oxtail loco moco ($9.99 I think.). Everyone was pleased with their dish. Food came out pippin hot....that's always important to me. I would love to come back again and try other entrees.",2017-01-16 18:03:12

The house salad dressing is super yummy. I like to buy it and take it to go and then serve it to my house guest, everyone asks ""what type of dressing is this""  of course I tell them that I made it.

This spot is kinda small, so I would say its more of a grab and go location. The staff is just and friendly as most others in this area.

I love lobster and eat it as often as I can, and I gotta say the quality is on the same level as a high end fine dining restaurant ( without the cost of course). I had the lobster tacos and the lobsters tots.  The salsa in top was very delicious, with the cabbage slaw adds a great crunch. I loved the texture. I must say it is hard to find a perfect tater tots, as most are either not crispy enough or burned, but their lobster tots were perfect.  I want more as I am writing this .....",2015-03-18 23:13:18

Yes, the size of the chicken is smaller, but it's easy to notice the quality of the tender and flavorful meat (no MSG!) once you bite into it. I was feeling a little under the weather and was thinking about making some chicken rice soup, except I had no chicken. I wanted healthy, pre-cooked chicken, so that I could cook a quick, nourishing meal for myself. I remembered that Nuro Bistro specialized in Hainan chicken, and I decided to order just the whole chicken to go. When I got home, I ate a few pieces and was immediately surprised by the non-oily deliciousness of the skin and meat! No extra seasoning needed! I basically dumped the cut-up chicken into my home-made, soupy porridge, heated them together, and in about 15 minutes, I had the best, wholesome and hearty lunch that also helped me feel much better later in the day! 

I hope Nuro Bistro can stay in business because its location (across the street from the Mint Indian place) in a small, somewhat empty shopping plaza next to a tailor shop doesn't seem to attract a lot of people traffic. The cost of Nuro's chicken is a bit expensive, but not unreasonable for the higher quality of the product. I'm usually a fried chicken eater, but the steamed chicken here is so good that I could easily switch to the lighter, better-for-my-heart-and- arteries side! :D",2018-06-09 16:00:39

Just to the right of the ARIA entrance if you're coming from the front, if you're inside Crystals it's right across from Todds PUB.

Pretty chandeliers and even prettier women dancing (and balancing swords) on the catwalk in the center of the restaurant. 

Pear & Sage salad, Caesar Salad, Chicken Chop (flavorful), Beef Short Ribs (juicy & tender), Potato Puree (Mashed Taters), Creamed Corn (thick and tasty, not that stuff of your nightmares, a 
MUST ORDER), Sinnamon Twists, SHeSCAKE (not your normal cheesecake, a VERY HARD oatmeal crust? and some of the air-iest cheese cake I have ever had).

Everything was good, service was attentive and the bill came out to $126 before gratuity for two people to get super stuffed.

I am mostly a homebody when in North America, but not even the most tightly threaded sheets and thickest walls could keep me indoors during the Picasso exhibit.  One week after visiting, I spent an hour on the phone with a flamboyant call agent who eventually seduced me into a 'plus one' membership.  Now I can enjoy the glorious art in Toronto premier art gallery in the company of any guest I please (as long as they're willing to go with me).

I never the scale of which Toronto is able to host major art exhibitions. Throughout the year, tours of some of the most infamous pieces of art make their way to Toronto.  But what's even more overwhelming to me, is the art not advertised that are housed in AGO's facilities. 
The statue of the Think Man, that big painting of the things that happened in Rome...and many other historically significant pieces of art that I can't name.

Then there's the facility itself.  Mostly minimalistic in design, hardly appropriate for an gallery for a city of Toronto's scale.  But The Thompson Collection area is quite a different story.  There are a pleathora of great photo opportunities, although not every spot in the gallery is camera permissible.  

There is a members' only club at the rear of the building which serves casual drinks and light snacks.  But I've only been interested in it's alcohol menu, which should be improved.  The waiters there are somewhat artistic themselves, in terms of how they decorate their..face..
The club is very quiet, aside from a lady in her 80's walking around offer a tour of the club, which used to be the private residence of some of Old Toronto's most prominent figures and socialites.  The land even has connections to Bishop Strachan, which carries personal significance to me, NOT (just) because there's an all girls' school named after him.  

At the entrance there is the gallery gift shop which shelves many books, novelty items, and ridiculously overpriced tableware.  There is also a jewelry section selling very ugly merchandise.  Through the gift shop you'll find FRANK, the gallery's restaurant.  The design to the restaurant is horribly retro-esk, as if Andy Worhol had some kind of personal connection to designing the space.  I hate Andy Worhol, by the way. 
But the food is not bad, and the service is...not bad either.  
There is a downstairs area where coffee or tea can be purchased, the service there is just about the worst I have ever encourtered anywhere in Toronto.  It's absolutely appalling how nonchalant the woman behaves when giving you your coffee cup and telling you that the coffee is to your right side.  The simple task of her job seems to gives her certification to act as engregiously as she please.

I think Wednesdays are free to the general public, and lines tend to get rather long.  I strongly recommend purchasing a membership.  It's much better and expedient service, and it just makes better sense fiscally.  

The gallery struggles with funding, I can see it in their newsletters.  But if given the proper attention, the AGO had great potential to become a world class facility.  I honestly believe this.",2012-12-11 03:51:39

I just think they are so basic! It's kewl that there is a $5 burger of the day,  but In-n-Out is right next door, and sometimes they put some questionable items as the ""deal."" 

Their beer is simply overpriced as major competition in the area can attest to. I think they had the idea this was going to be lie their Scottsdale location. Whole Foods might be near by, but even that store is more reasonably priced then it's Scottsdale counterpart. 

I would say their meat's calibur is on par with Smash Burger, but with Applebee's prices. It was a bit awkward in their as well. Most of the staff was robotic and it didnt feel personable at all. I don't plan on being a repeat customer if they aren't able to step up and perform at an acceptable level of quality.

I heard that they had really good burgers, but they were a bit pricey. I heard right about the burgers being pricey. But were the burgers really good? More like mediocre. I got the classic cheddar burger and the burger was juicy but some parts of the burger were quite tough. The bun was un-toasted so it quickly became soggy. The fries weren't that bad, but not spectacular. 
Now onto the service, she was very slow with our orders, bringing our food, getting our bills and she didn't even get a glass for one of my friends when he ordered water. She just handed him a water bottle. She didn't tell us about the extra adds on available and that it would cost more if we substituted for a whole wheat bun. My meal of the classic burger and water came up to about $20. I wouldn't come here again. You can get a very good burger at burger's priest downtown for less than that. I would rather commute downtown than come here. I'm very disappointed :(",2016-06-25 01:38:08
