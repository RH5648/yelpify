The fries are sometimes good and sometimes great, and the spicy dipping sauce they come with is to die for. The beer list is amazing and the cocktails are great. The prices are mid-level, so it's not a cheap dive you can go to every week, but rather a treat when you do. Try it out. You won't be disappointed!",2015-12-05 03:18:11

Yes just as others are griping about the Drive thru is packed just like most of the other canes in the area but I like to go sit down to enjoy my chicken. The cashiers are pleasant and as far as food wise i have yet to receive any funky chicken. The clean up crew zips around the dining area constantly so it's usually well kept. My only gripe is the one fella with Red hair he makes the rounds while cleaning but no smile or personality a few nights ago he tossed the napkins i just put on the table to help go with my meal. After I was done he just reached for my tray no ""excuse me or are you done with that?""  I realize he's trying to do his job quickly but a little table manners goes along way. That being said still like to grub here and glad that there's finally a Cane's close to me.",2017-01-14 21:56:57

Collard greens, mac&cheese, ribs, BBQ chicken sandwich. The scone with clotted cream was divine!!!! The iced teas are very refreshing and I swear I drank a whole container myself both visits. 
The second time I had soup, salad and a sandwich. The salad had this amazing (raspberry? strawberry?, I forgot) vinaigrette. The sandwich was good, but I was kind of disappointed with the soup. It was potato and tasted too ""milky"". 
They change the menu often and now have a tea inspired one. Can't wait to go back and try it.
The owners are very nice and I hope they continue to do well.",2009-10-13 04:16:41

I discovered this place from the front desk of the airport hotel and they recommended it highly. I called to place my order for Delivery to my room. They were very accommodating.

Won Ton Soup - nice broth and tender won tons.

Chicken with Diced vegetables and Cashews - again, fresh vegetables were used, and good sized pieces of chicken.

Crispy Beef - much like a Ginger Beef, nice serving of Beef with a sweet chilli sauce. Very tasty.

Broccoli in Garlic sauce - came with peppers,Onions , Broccoli was not over done.

All in all for Delivery , this was really good. I am used to going to Authentic Asian in Vancouver. This hit the spot, and they also sent me a nice tub of Chilli Oil because I like it Hot.",2015-10-17 01:38:13

The five of us drove here on our lunch hour and lucky us, there were only a few customers in line. Nice!  A good sign, when UR working against a clock. 

I ordered the PÃ³ke (Photo) for $11.99 which was outstanding.  I love fresh Tuna and Coconut's might be some of the best I've every had.  Order it and see!

My coworkers ordered, the Chicken Tacos for $11.99, Steak Tacos (Photos) for $11.49, Fish Taco for $10.99 and a cup of Chowder for $5.74. Add in a few IPAs, or soft drinks and we all averaged about $15 each.

I tried my friend Josh's Fish Tacos and his was great, too.  So why they Four Star review, Georgie? Well the non fish group thought theirs was average. Okay, so you go to a place called Coconut's Fish Cafe and you order chicken and steak?  I'm sorry, that is so LOL. 

Step away from the meat taco guys and no one will get hurt!  Order the Poke, Fish or Shrimp Tacos and you'll fall in love with Coconut's Fish Cafe as I did.

ATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.

SERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.

PRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)


FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.

Here's the pizza we ordered:

Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.

Margherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more ""special"" toppings instead.

Shall return, and/or try other locations.",2017-06-06 19:04:10

We want it to be - we have been several times hoping, but the experience is always at best, lackluster.  The food is not great, very run-of the mill on a good day and the serve staff though very nice is always - and I have never had the same person twice - always totally lost and under-trained.  It blows my mind because they can't possibly know alcohol laws if they don't know anything about the menu - going to bite that company one day.  I am not sure but I think someone I know told me they do the shared tip thing and I thought maybe that may be why but I know another place that does that and the service is excellent.  I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.

NHQWhZve7UEaGLt7IwAyDw,H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,2,5,3,4,"This actually used to be one of my favorite hotel/casinos back in the day.  Oh, how things have changed.

There are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.

The biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. 

The ""Space Lounge"" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.

With their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their ""big draw"" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.

The arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  

There's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was ""ha ha"" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.

Ladies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.

As critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called ""Triumph"" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.

The sad part is, Hilton's one of those ""history rich"" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.

This place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.",2011-01-09 00:09:50

It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.

Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.

The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.

Enjoying a nice dinner out and felt like seafood so we decided on this restaurant. We were greeted and taken to our seat right away. The restaurant sets a more professional, upscale type atmosphere.

We were greeted by our server and he took our drink order. We started with the seafood platter which had shrimp, oysters, lobster tails and a crab mix. Love seafood? Get this for sure! The oysters were quite large and not amongst the freshest I've ever had but they were still good. 

For dinner we enjoyed the chicken and the scallops with a side if crab fried rice. Crab fries rice was full of flavor and really good! Scallops had a citrus flavor added which made it even more tasty. 

Service was above par as well. Our server was attentive and friendly.

Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.

The ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.

Our waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.",2014-08-10 23:03:05

I was the same as Mel U.  I had been past this place a couple times and never thought to go in.  I think it may be because it's on the ""outskirts"" of town and a section I really don't go to often.  

First off I'll say I love the outdoor seating area!  It was a front row seat to all the furry watching action going on outside the Westin and convention center.  Plus let's face it, it's always great to have outdoor seating!  

Since they're known for their martini's I had to indulge!  I ordered the Cosmo-Tonic because for some reason I've been really into Cosmo's lately.  With all tini's, you really have to have the right mixture.  I hate when there's too much Cranberry or even too much Vodka (gasp, I know!).    This was a perfect mix I'm glad to report!  Nice job shake masters!  I also tried my friends Lemon Drop Martini, holy bejebus, it was WAY too sweet for me!  I'll stick to my other options out there!

Let's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.

I ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi/sashimi/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi/sashimi/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.

Everything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi/sashimi/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.

What probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.

Free wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned.",2013-07-13 00:57:45

I was immediately impressed upon ordering at Bang Bang Burgers. I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!
I don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. 
The sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. 
Overall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight ""drawbacks"", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.",2015-06-08 18:56:14

I stopped here late after work one night on the way home after having passed it at least a thousand times, and decided to give it a try. I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. 

The inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. 

The young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. 

I ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored.

We ended up spending $35 for two people for lunch, but I'm ok with that since we got two salads (both with protein added), iced tea, and fresh juice. My husband even commented that the food was much better quality that what we'd get at another fast-casual type restaurant. 

I ate here again a few weeks later - called my order in and it was ready to go when I arrived. They even have a separate door and counter for take out.

The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's. I'm an american born and raised indian so I'm suggesting some of the more tame whitewashed options. The service is quick and the staff is always attentive.

Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good.
Here are some details:  
Pasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.
Sauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.
The le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  
The carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti/lasagna place.
As a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.",2009-03-01 19:50:23

You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.

I learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.

The menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. 

My eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was ""not a mistake"". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.

I was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crÃ¨me caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED.

Their meat, it's not real- but trust me, it's a good thing. Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the ""meat"" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great.

Only friends and family were invited. We felt very special- either to be considered part of the Spicy Pickle family, or maybe because we made such ridiculous fools of ourselves at the window that they thought we might be ""special"" in the other meaning. Perhaps.
Either way, free lunch.

It's not as though I could give a stinky review to anything given to me for free- I might feel bad- but this was just what the doctor ordered. 

Not for the weak at heart.

It's not just a clever name. Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite.

I ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose.
I could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked.

Al had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup.

Mickey had the Gobbler with a side salad. When she bit into the panini she made a face that I think should remain in the bedroom. Enough said.

Bryan had the salad and enjoyed it immensely. It didn't look like much, but I might have to return when they open tomorrow and try it out for myself. The croutons did look very appetizing.

One of the attentive staff members made the rounds with a tray of mini chocolate chip cookies. Fantastic. Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Mama like.

All in all, I'll be back. Probably tomorrow. And maybe the day after...

AMENDMENT:
OK, so I did go back the next day... and today (which is the following day). Yesterday I had the tuna salad, which was delish. Theur tuna is a little kicked up, as it's made with chipotle mayo (but really not too much) and spoicy pickle relish. Tasty. It was served over a bed of greens with a lemon olive oil dressing.
Today I had the med sub. It was ok- nothing out of the ballpark. I got it with the spoinach salad, which was also delish.

The cashier said you could ask for salt, but what frustrated me is that they were always perfectly salted before and while I understand some people will say it's too salty, you can't go from quite salty to no salt at all.

The Nachos were delicious! Served in a baking pan with sour cream and salsa on the side; and even though it was basic nachos (veggies and cheese), it was probably the best I had - they didn't try to mess up a good thing by adding extra toppings. Huge portion too! 

The drinks were so affordable! Hooch hour starts after 10pm so all shots were 2$ each and 5$ bar rails! I like the fact that the end of the restaurant turns into a dance floor after maybe 11pm if memory serves me right and they played awesome music the night I was there. 

The best thing about this place, in my opinion, is that there's a mini bar attached to the dance floor with the main bar being so close and is the centre of the restaurant. Would highly recommend this place if you're not into the club scene but want to go to a place with good food and great music",2017-11-06 22:08:35

The only thing that keeps me coming back is that it is a 24 hour drive thru and really hits the spot if you've been drinking.

I would give another star, but I've just been told they are raising the already high price.  Plus, people don't seem to understand the one way signs in the parking lot, or just the parking lot in general.  I've def been honked and yelled at for following the rules.

The front desk help are always pleasant, once you get to them.  I normally don't have the best of interactions with other patrons while waiting in line, but that seems to be the idea on this side of town.

The locker rooms are decent, nothing special.  Plenty of open lockers most times of the day.  You will rarely find yourself solo in the sauna or steam rooms.

I've only swam here once, I need to get on that.  I've never used the basketball courts or anything outside.  I stick to the weight room.  I have never had to wait on a bike or a treadmill.  If I'm looking for a stair climber that can be another story though.  The bikes are no where near as nice as the Dowd.  The only thing I ever have to wait on are the free weights.  There's plenty of weights, but not much room at all to use them.  If you want a lay down bench, you will probably have to wait, especially at peak hours.

All in all, it is what it is.  Its close, so this is where I go.  Plus, there is a 24 hour Harris Teeter right there where nobody looks at you funny for being sweaty in gym clothes.  But, If somebody calls me asking if I want to go to a nicer location, I do.",2015-12-28 05:52:45

Deciding not to go with a burger for the umpteenth time, I instead chose the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sandwich, which comes complete with a pineapple ring, a drape of provolone cheese, and roasted red peppers. It's shame that the exquisitely tender chicken didn't smack much of jerk seasoning, though. Nonetheless, sweet, savory, tart, and creamy cavorted brilliantly together within a Sunday dinner-worthy Kaiser roll on a Saturday night. A flawless pile of housemade, kettle-plunged, perfectly salted potato chips complimented the soft and juicy sandwich with their inherent crunch factor. 

A domineering cleat of an after-dinner treat, the Snickers Ice Cream Pie had me bug-eyed upon its arrival, something my wonderful server (name forgotten) got a laugh out of. 

Carvel had nothing on this monstrosity of vanilla and chocolate ice cream that was garnished with nuts, candy pieces, and sauces of the caramel, white chocolate, and dark chocolate varieties. An Oreo crust would hold this sundae-on-a-plate together, bringing more texture as well as stability to this luscious, saccharine, bon-bon-riddled masterpiece of frozen confection. 

With quick, courteous, adept service and above average bar food, Lot 17 has hollowed out a deserved niche for itself in this restaurant-heavy area of Pittsburgh. Considering I have credit left on that card and that Hot Card participants are dwindling, I may be overdue for another visit, and it will be without a hint of reluctance, Lot 17 proving itself to be a sturdy dining option in a neighborhood with much...

We sat outside (for the first time this year!) and really relished the last light of the day. The waitress was nice and friendly, although she was a little swamped. Once she took our order, the food came pretty fast. While we all had beer, I was actually the only one having fish and chips. My girlfriend had the veggie poutine (they have vegetarian gravy that is not bad) and our friend had a cheeseburger with fries and salad. We all enjoyed our food and I was pleasantly surprised by how calm this street is (compared to busy main streets like saint Denis or Mont-Royal where it's not as nice to sit out in the street). I was also glad for the opportunity to sit outside because sitting inside on the bar makes it harder to have a conversation when more than two people are involved, plus there is a lot of oil in the air near the kitchen.

6 hours round trip, 2 liters of water, holes in my shoe, change in headband, backpack tan, sunglass tan, burnt arms, sore legs, and dirt all over my body was the result of my trip at Turtlehead Peak.Making it to the top of Turtlehead Peak I was rewarded with a really nice cool breeze, an ammo box holding a signature book, and one of the best views I have ever seen in my life. Worth it? Yes. Would I do it again? Probably not. 

Would not recommend for something looking for a nice stroll in nature or a quick hike (less than 4 hours). 

What I learned from my experience and mistakes is that you should have the following items with you:

1. Excess water (better to have more than less in this case)
2. Sunblock
3. Hiking shoes or comfortable shoes that you don't mind destroying.
4. FOOD! ( I really lacked on this one, I ate prior to the hike, but all that uphill really took a toll on my energy. I appreciate the kindness of whoever left a Clifbar inside the ammo box holding the signature book. Don't think I would of made it down without one)
5. A companion
6. A map or GPS device.
7. Focus
8. Patience

P.S. Don't get off the trail like my group did within the first 15 minutes. There are trail markers for you that will make the trip a lot less strenuous and more enjoyable.

Basically I curated this woman's art, sacred objects and artifacts collection and needless to say it was a very memorable week working in what you can imagine to be a very eclectic home.  When the job finished my client invited the crew and I to a celebration dinner which brought us to a restaurant in Inglewood on 9th avenue S.E. called Sugo Caffe Italia.

Just sitting outside Sugo I felt underdressed and so did my co-workers but our appetites and curiosity managed to find our way into the restaurant where our reservation of 6 was warmly greeted by the staff.  The decor in this restaurant is exquisite, simple and clean with accents of contemporary earthy art pieces on warm muted walls.  Jarred tomatoes and jams are illuminated upwards with mini lights shining brightly from beneath them and antique chandeliers hang above dripping with crystal raindrops and lined pearl beads.  There is no corner that has not been thought out decoration wise here and the table settings are complete with artisan ceramics and fine crystal glassware.

An average meal is between 20 to 40 dollars but once you savour the many dishes on a menu that changes every evening and the many cheese options that I couldn't pronounce you are completely titillated.  Every meal's presentation has been evoked with an artist's touch and the freshest ingredients are presented in front of you to tantalize your palate.  I was extremely impressed by an ample Scotch list, over 15 choices and the huge portions of deserts that were presented in the most elegant formations that look like one could almost wear them as head pieces.

Cue Club is large inside and out. Like how can they use this much space? The bartender gave us the lowdown as soon as we walked in: the building is divided into smoking and non smoking and each have either quarter tables or pay by the hour tables. Apparently you can only do pay by the hour if you're a pro. We chose the non smoking side and there were 2-3 other tables being used at the time. The jukebox was surprisingly really good until someone chose to play their own tunes. We did end up smelling like cigarette smoke afterwards. Not sure if this is from hanging out in the smoking area initially or if it's so overpowering that it gets into the non smoking area. They also have shuffleboard and a few carnival style games like skee ball. Knowing that most any billiards hall in Vegas is going to be equally smoky I think I'd rather come here and know your chances of getting a table are pretty good and they're at least attempting to offer a non smoking option.,2018-10-04 17:47:38

The kids started with the junior carts and that was the right call as neither really had much experience driving carts (Mario Kart doesn't count) so they were a bit cautious at first. However, in their second race they put the pedal to the metal and tested the limits of their speed-limited carts.

The adults took the big carts for a run and I was lucky to be racing with novices and took the checkered flag in one of the two races. I was foiled by a ""pile up"" in one of the races which killed my lap average. :) My lovely wife took a nice stroll around the course and it was fun to wave as I zipped by.

The service was excellent. The track-workers were hilarious. All in all a great experience.

I have received sports massages, Swedish and deep tissue. I consider La Vida to be a very good facility and Angel to be a very competent therapist. For more than 6 months I have gone once every 3-4 weeks.

I work out regularly and consider a massage a great way to heal sore muscles and low back pain from sitting at a desk all day. After my old therapist moved to Florida, I began the annoying process of trying new ones. Some have trouble dialing up or down the pressure. Some can't get the low back pain out like others. Some reek of cigarette smoke. Some are lazy, using one hand at a time instead of two.

Then I found Angel, who is quite competent. If you wanna chat, she'll chat. If you want quiet relaxation, she'll put you at ease. If you say ""I hurt here"", she will solve it. I consider one of Angel's attributes to be the fact she can dial up or down pressure just BARELY, and maintain that. She can find where it hurts and, due to her through knowledge of fascia and layers of tissue, massage the pain away. After repeat sessions, she understands I need more pressure on the right side of my spine than my left. Angel's ability to meet her clients needs combined with her through knowledge of muscle and fascia along with the ability to maintain consistent pressure make her an extremely competent therapist.

If Angel is busy or sick, Ivan is a fantastic alternative. He's an A in my book, with Angel an A+. Edit: Forgot to mention, Ivan's strengths are deep tissue and neck work. If your neck specifically is killing you or you need real deep tissue, Ivan is your man.

La Vida is an upper middle / yuppie chain massage location with ample parking. I feel strongly that these are superior to middle brow chain massage places (such as Massage Envy) and superior to upscale spas (such as Sewickly or Seven Springs or Esspa). Simply put, La Vida has lots of returning clients and as such, a steady stream of business and competent and calm massage therapists with little turnover.",2014-02-05 20:28:23

""there are no brides either so all the times you see it referred to as Bridal Path is wrong. "" Artur C.   ell oh ell 8^ D

I really love this path.  I like going out into wilderness more than strolling through the city's center, but THERE'S SHADE ON THIS TRAIL !!!   Yea!
If you were to go all heat stroke it wouldn't take a helicopter to extract you!   Yea!
Lots of friendly people of various hobbies and fitness levels, and a Boy Scout troop (I cannot recall the name of to give credit to) has even continued to supply the doggie mitt boxes with real pick-up bags, even though the city of Phoenix has stopped supplying them to all of the dog parks.
At the north end of the path, you are a little south of Dunlap ave, near Corbin's and Bombero's, and at a crossroads with the Trail going along the Canal.  You can park in the lot at Senior Villa Mexican Restaurant [*Edit: Formerly this mexican rest, but now the new Central Grille at 8525 N Central*].  If you want to start further south, then there are plenty of churches where you can prob park, but this restaurant is not open in the early part of the day, so even on weekends, this is a nice place to park.  
Lock up!  Despite your surroundings, and those even more posh further to the south, you are only a 5 minute walk from downtown Sunnyslope. 
On the southwest side of the canal, there's a house with it's back wall bordering the canal path.  The folks here have built a few Guard Towers for their little dog, and s/he gets to runs up the steps to see over the wall and bark at whomever is going by.  NEAT and FUN for that dog, but was a little distracting to my dogs, who wanted to eat that yappy little....)
Only trouble I had: 
once you're down the road a bit further south on Central, you are moving past various houses, estates, and condominiums, and are no longer near any of those restaurants up near Dunlap, however there is a distinct odor of DIRTY SPENT FRYER GREASE all up and down the path.  I wonder if the city sprays a petroleum product on the unpaved path to keep dust down?  I hope not; they did that on my street as a kid in Detroit, and anyone who walked on it barefoot got blisters, cracking, and peeling skin.  Blech!  Even if I lived near here, I'd rather have the dust, and I don't want that on my dogs feet, either. One reason I'd use this path in the summer is that with all the nice sized shade trees, you don't need to get your dog booties.

I have two dogs - one loves everyone (so this was easy for him) and the other is ... a little more hesitant. When I came in, the lobby seemed pretty busy (they were getting low on seating, but not out) and I took a number. I was seen less than 30 minutes later, and never felt like my wait was too long.

When I was taken back, there are tables set up, where the vets and vet techs come talk with you and help your pet. You're not in a separate room (like my old vet). This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think for one of my dogs it was better because while he got blood drawn and a vaccine, he was too distracted to care - there was (what looked like a) lab/pit mix across the room who may have at one point looked at him! How interesting! and that golden over there! What's that smell behind me?

Everyone that works there is friendly, and they work quickly. Since they work rather quickly, don't expect to sit down and have a long conversation. They get to the point, and then send you on your way because there are twenty more dogs to be seen. I never felt rushed though.

If you own pets, you know that they can be expensive. Even small expenses add up quickly. I ended up at Gateway because I priced out my annual vet trip at my old vet and cringed. A lot. I called around and checked out a few other places. I felt like Goldilocks. One vet was a little cheaper, but the staff seemed to hate their jobs and maybe me. Another vet was more expensive but seemed nice. Gateway? Gateway was just right. Gateway didn't offer me any discount, yet I felt like I got two for the price of one (I paid what I would have for just one dog at my old place). My dogs got their vaccines for the next year plus(heartworm and rabies), as well as kennel cough, and one of my dogs got microchipped. Previously I was told that the kennel cough vaccine is given every other year as a shot, and every other nasal - but Gateway had oral. That was so much easier on both of my dogs! One of my dogs is a pug, so the nasal was unpleasant for him and I (on the plus side, last year I got the vaccine as well - since he sprayed it all over me). 

Both of my dogs seemed well cared for while I was there, and got plenty of love. The microchipped dog seemed neutral (and wouldn't take any treats from the vet tech after she took him to get microchipped), but he pug LOVED it. I practically had to drag him out of there. Being so incredibly busy, you'd expect Gateway to be a circus, but it was run pretty smoothly.

Went here with a group from work for an ""appreciation dinner""  Normally, Appreciation dinners end up at Chili's or Ruby Tuesday so I was completely shocked we ended up here.

Everything was great service wise.  Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.

The strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1/2 to 2/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.

The decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn't go beyond what he was expect to do.   

Sorry, Sullivans but I can get better service at Longhorn and frankly I think their food is better also.   But still this is a solid or 3 1/2 star review.",2013-11-14 05:56:23

I set an appointment online with no problem. Arrived about 15-20 minutes early, but I was greeted right away and asked to check in with another representative. Cool beans. 
Noticed they were slightly behind, but I'm not in a rush, plus going in I had expectations of them being busy. It's Apple. 
Gah... I wish I could remember my tech's name 'cause she was just as nice and courteous - just remember it starting with a D. She let me fully explain my iPhone problem, then she walked me through diagnosing with their speakers. She literally could tell that the difference I had with it compared to hers. Before trying to replace my phone, she wanted to know if I had any questions for her and I brought up how I bought the device from my cell provider. Not wanting to cause any problems with them, she wrote me a notice to bring to them just in case they wanted proof that the device needed to be replaced. All courteous and thoughtful. 
Other than my experience, I can commend them on trying to accommodate/help a mom and her 2 kids. The little brother overheard the patron say she had the wrong appointment time, but she had been waiting for awhile and had other appointments elsewhere. Before they could get to me, they helped her out first. Her tech was nice, trying to be personable with her and the kids while diagnosing the problem. Took him about 10-15 minutes to help her out, hopeful that she'd make it to their other engagements on time, and thankful for her patience.",2015-12-20 19:38:27

I replaced the filter and thoroughly cleaned the fridge, emptied and cleaned the ice bin several times to no avail. Chemical type smell, similar to freezer burn, but different. Emptied the entire fridge (as that is where the ice maker is located), nothing helped. Looking at Google, I discovered this is a common problem. I contacted Lowe's as I have a 5 year warranty, and they sent Buy-Rite.

Tech showed up and used his laser thermometer in the fridge, drink drawer, and freezer. I explained that the issue was the way the ice was tasting/smelling, and not with the temperature. And also that it was a common problem reported online in reviews, etc. The tech told me there was no solution, but that he noticed dog hair under my fridge.

10th Floor, Venezia Tower.. Walked in here for Brunch. The place had a Classy Decor, Very Professional Staff and Clientele were mostly Upper Class looking individuals. 

Starters:

Bread with butter, jam and ketchup?!: Bread was shaped like a branch with leaves.. something like that. It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?

Cheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!

Croque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. 

Corned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton. Like a Toast Bread Shaped Crouton?!..

To me, it's ok. As long as you do a good job I don't mind buying from a copy cat. Saryo is a 2 in 1 shop with ramen (Konjiki) and the Saryo cafÃ©. This review is for Saryo.

I'm a matcha fiend and have to politely disagree with all the other reviewers praising Saryo's matcha. It really doesn't compare with Tsujiri. Tsujiri has a much longer history of doing matcha and Saryo's matcha is simply not the same grade. High quality matcha is supposed to have a subtle sweetness in addition to a slight bitter taste. Too bitter does not mean it's better. Saryo's matcha soft serve is simply not as pronounced and lacks that subtle sweetness I would expect. The texture is also a bit more runny than I would like. 

Also, their selection is much smaller than Tsujiri and most of the pastry items are a notch worse than Tsujiri. 

Customer service wise, I can't get over one of their servers. It's a guy named Taiki I think. Horrible service. If you want good matcha drinks and desserts, definitely go to Tsujiri instead. Prices are about the same but you get less quality at Saryo. I might try their houjicha as that seems to get a lot of praise.",2018-02-01 19:07:08

Over all it was good, I'd say the best was the bread, soft and fresh can't ever go wrong with that. Would I return, probably not, if they adjust the prices and have more lunch specials that are worth the travel then I probably say I would come back and try many other subs.

The food portions were huge. The hummus was good, but a bit too salty. The chicken shawarma was nicely seasoned in general, but was all dark meat, which I don't care for. Also, the garlic sauce was more like garlic mayonnaise, which I also dislike. I came prepared for the more traditional blend of garlic, lemon juice and olive oil which is generally served at my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis.

Both times I left happy and excited to return. 

La Plaza stocks most of the general staples you'd need from most groceries, though obviously there is a strong lean toward mexican, Central, and South American goods. 

Especially delightful to me is the meat counter with not only fresh chorizo, but also fresh chincharrones (PORK RINDS!) by the pound.

The fresh guacamole, salsa, and pico de gallo (also available  at the meat counter) are all superb, however there is only one heat rating for both the salsa and pico.  You get what you get, and you'll like it, gringo/a.

The produce section has lots of items that would be hard to track down elsewhere, as well as reasonable to great prices on other more common items.

I first ate at this chain a few years ago on a road trip to Florida and as I was sitting in the car eating my cheeseburger wrapped in tinfoil (commenting that maybe we shouldn't have each ordered a fries because they're HUGE) I complained that we needed this in Toronto. Well now we do! Haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. Not much was lost in the cross-border translation. From the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come North. 
The burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. I like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. The sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.
The fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. And, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. They actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.
It's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your money's worth. No other burger chain comes close.",2014-02-05 18:37:14

A lot of people complain about this place because they say ""Ooh the cashier was unfriendly"" or ""Oh the food wasn't like an asian master would prepare"" well no kidding you big drungus, it's because you're at Pei Wei and it's like a fast food place if you wanted authentic asian experiences you screwed up already.

Pei Wei is where you go if you want a bowl of noodles or rice and you want some stuff on top with a sauce.  Just order it and move down the line and if there's a table then sit at a table or maybe take it back to you office.  It's just food.  This location is pretty average in terms of speed and politeness, and the food seems to be cooked appropriately so what else do you want?

Here's my PRO TIP: When you go to the place where the drinks are right after you order, get a fortune cookie, but slip it into your pocket, then at the end of the meal, go back and say outloud ""Oh man I am going to get a fortune cookie"" so they don't think you're taking two and then swipe a second one and eat it there.  They've got the most delicious fortune cookies and even though the messages are usually something stupid about sports like ""Oh you're gonna have a good sportsball game tomorrow"" you can still enjoy the cookie, and you've already swiped a second one to enjoy later so you're the real winner - sportsball or not.",2014-02-23 22:01:54

The hall is close to the subway which made it easy to get to... probably easier than trying to find parking around there.

I ordered to-go from their lunch menu: sweet and sour chicken with vegetable lo mein and rice ($8).

It took nearly 30 minutes for it to arrive so now I'm rushing back to my office to chow it down. It's a good thing I didn't have to rush because the food was so bland I didn't even bother finishing it. 

I should have known it was going to be gross when my server pulled the lo mein out of a giant rice steamer. The noodles were not seasoned (btw- where were the vegetables in my vegetable lo mein?!) and way over cook. Maybe it was because the noodles have been sitting in the rice steamer all day!

The sweet and sour chicken was pretty much non-seasoned, chicken nuggets swimming in sweet and sour sauce. There were some chunks of green peppers too but I couldn't get over the canned sweet and sour sauce that was infiltrating into my rice pile.

The best part of the meal were the fortune cookies. Mine said-- Next time, drive a bit east and you will find Pei Wei... or maybe that Chicago Hamburger Company across the street will do too!

I've been looking around at the new Nissan Murano. I recently visited Avondale Nissan just to test drive and discuss costs. The people there were very rude and turned me off on buying a new car any time soon. 

The other day I received a personal text from Bryson asking if I was in the market to buy a new car, which I have been. I told him what I wanted over text and about my Juke and finances. He was able to write up a deal and call me with the info which made the process easy! Saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. And they got my interest rate at 3.24 when Avondale Nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when I had zero credit. My credit  is in the 700's so there is no way I should have been ripped off at 7% like Avondale Nissan tried. 

I was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership. At pinnacle they gave me $12000 which significantly more and paid off my previous loan; even giving me some extra towards the price of my new Murano. 

I was impressed by my experience. John in financing was fantastic and very good at explaining the process. Bryson was also very helpful in making the process as easy as possible. 

I'm picky and the Murano i wanted wasn't available in Arizona so they found it in Nevada and had it shipped. I was told about 4 days and put into a loaner Murano. My new Murano came in a day in a half and is exactly what I wanted.

This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. 

HINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. 

Sat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong.

------------------------------------------

Hopefully the airport completes its rehab quickly... The check in area is in disarray... People walking all over the place with no clear indication/signs for where each airline ticketing location is... I agree construction can be a disruption but clear signage and airport staff guiding passengers will be helpful. 

Just a note: I have been flying out of CLE on a weekly basis for the past 2 months...

To add to the chaos, TSA at CLE is the worst (not that they are good anywhere but you can't get through security in less than 30 mins). One Sunday evening the security line was all the way to the other end of the airport, and guess what there were 3 TSA Pre agents and no one for the regular line??? What were they thinking...

Once you clear security check, the boarding area is clean and organized. Airline and restaurant staff are helpful and there are multiple flights leaving to all major hubs. 

There is a Starbucks right after clearing security and the line moves quick. They are open early am (5:30am) so you can get your fix.

It was totally my fault that I set up a breakfast meet up at 10a and a lunch meet up at noon.  I'm either looking to gain 1000 lbs or am busy.  I'll take the busy option.  So since i was stuffed from an incredible waffle from Sugar Cafe I decided to get my fav salad of the moment, a beet salad.  It was a pretty big disappointment.  I'd say it was MAYBE 1/3 a beat with TINY little cubes of beets, lettuce leaves and blue cheese.  Blue Cheese with beats?  No feta, really?!  Ok, I'm looking too much into this beet salad, but for realz, it was sorta lame.  

Our server was OK, but sorta seemed like she wasn't into serving that day.  She kept forgetting to bring my friend her drink and she just seemed pretty lackadaisical.

My friends and I would got to the Green Valley Ranch location about once a week until it was closed down.  Then we started going to the Tropicana location (although not as frequently due to the location).  We recently found about this particular location on Maryland and wanted to give it a try.

The manager, DJ, transferred from the Tropicana location.  He remembers our names (even though we only go a couple times a month these days) and is always welcoming and friendly.

This location is a bit different than most Wingstop locations.  There is a bar area.  There is more seating than normal.  The walls are lined with TVs showing sports.  I like all these things.  At the other Wingstop locations I would feel cramped and would want to leave soon after finishing my meal.

The wings I got on this trip were exceptionally large.  I've never had a problem with wing size at Wingstop and these were even bigger than usual.  I typically get the hot sauce which has a decent amount of kick.  The wings are never undercooked or overcooked and are quite tender and juicy.

I love the ranch sauce.  It's thin without being watery.  Hard to explain, but it's perfect for going with the hot wings.

They have TWO of the coke machines with the touchscreens.  I love those touchscreens, but people can be slow figuring them out.  With two of them there I hardly saw a line waiting for them.

The only negative about Wingstop is the price.  A small soda, dozen wings, and a ranch cost me over $12.",2013-10-03 13:42:56

I've been familiar with this place since I was a kid, and used to LOVE taking the drive over there. The place is just so laid back, with the giant apple-shaped apple stand on the side of the building, which used to sell candy apples and apple cider, though I haven't seen it open in some time. Maybe I've just been arriving at the wrong time? There's also currently a petting zoo on the other side of the building, with a coin-operated machine that dispenses feed for the animals. 

Inside is your typical tiny grocery store/butcher. They do sell many specialty items that you may not find at a regular grocery store, along with pretty much anything Apple that you can think of. But all of that is foreplay to the main attraction: THE PIES. They have their own little pie patrol that bakes the freshest, most delicious homemade pies, I don't think I've ever bought one that wasn't 100% fresh and amazing. 
I've never really been a pie-guy, but this place is different. And if you don't want an entire pie, they also sell slices. Their strawberry rhubarb is amazing. I've never Jason Biggs'd a pie before, but the s.r. has definitely gotten a couple of suggestive glances from me.

As for the service, the employees are always very sweet, helpful, and have been known to give out free apple cider at times.

The tribute shows are making the rounds ( Elvis, Neil Diamond, ""Ledgends"") and this tribute show to the Beatles is one of the very best in Vegas. 
A real  benefit of this show is that the ticket prices are $40 -50.00. A great value when compared to other shows with ticket prices spiraling up towards $175 -200.00
The show is presented in two parts, the first part is early Beatle tunes with the four dressed in the neru jackets. The second half is later beatles music with the Fab Four changing into Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club outfits. The final song is a solo rendition of John Lennons ""Imagine.""
Great stuff, great music and a dynamic ending with ""Imagine. ""
This show gets you singing along with all the songs you know by heart - and it does not take much imagination for you to close your eyes and swear that the real Beatles are performing right in front of you. They play their own instruments ( unlike the Monkees ) and have the songs down pat. They even look the part.

You must go visit their digs, I promise, you won't be sorry when you're sipping a delicious red or white! This space is really beyond words. As soon as you walk in you feel like you've traveled to some far away castle in a romantic foreign city. It's dimly lit, with beautiful dark wood and a fully stocked bar waiting for you to imbibe. 

They have six wines right now, but the grapes are crushed fresh in house (or at least in the presence of the winemaker, Tim), so you know they're not rushing to produce a mass amount of products, just a handful of marvelous blends! My fave of the moment is the Malbec. I've been really into it for a while now and really love their blend. I honestly have had some pretty bad ones, and this is true to form. I also think this is such a white wine type of area, I'm glad to see a place putting effort into promoting the reds.

But here's the other cool thing. They have a downstairs area that matches the same cool vibe of the upstairs. It's thee perfect place for an unique event. It apparently fits around 100 and would be the perfect pick for a small reception or a hip party. I wouldn't care what kind of event it was, I'd want to crash it here!

Being a vegetarian, Ike's is like heaven to me. Whenever there is more than two veggie options on a menu, I start to seize up with indecision (in the best way possible). Their fake breaded chicken is so good. It reminds me of the patty used in McDonald's spicy chicken sandwich (again, in the best way possible).

I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, ""The Buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.

First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.

It used to be unlimited, along with all the thinly sliced beef, pork, and sliced chicken, seafood (including crab legs and shrimp), veggies that you can DIY cook in the hot pot at your table.  But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! 

I first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.

So when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.

The main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  

The DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.

I would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.

Note:  There is a ""bar"" in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.

I ""Yelped"" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  

My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.

Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.  

Sincerely,
A very disappointed EX-patron",2013-05-07 20:01:31

I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.

I was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. 

Unfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. 

The weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).

My brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail?? 

My experience here was beyond unprofessional. I'm glad, now, that I went where I did for my car. Berge only saw my business as a number. I will never shop with them.",2015-01-03 21:02:26

It also has Chai, but it isn't good. I don't recommend coming for dinner. The menu is a la carte and a bit pricey for what you get. The portion sizes are very small and you don't get any rice or naan. We ordered a goat curry dish and chicken curry dish and there was only about 5-6 pieces of meat in the dish servings. They ran about $13-15 too! We expected a lot more for that price. I think rice and/or naan should come standard with dishes here (especially in that price range).

I'm not a sushi (or seafood) person so I tried to go in with an open mind since I was the only one in our group who didn't eat sushi. They all loved most of the choices of the rolls they got, the only exception was the appetizer that was ordered. For the price, it was NOT worth it! Was maybe 4 bites worth of food. There was one other sushi roll that wasn't worth the price but I do not remember which one it was. Other than those two things, the rolls were awesome and they almost couldn't finish everything. 

Since I don't eat seafood, I got the chicken katsu. I do believe that it was overpriced for what you got ($14 for 1 chicken breast, a little rice, soup, and a tiny salad) BUT, it was delicious! We are planning on going back to celebrate my husband's birthday there this weekend and I can't wait to order the katsu again and he's looking forward to the Vegas, Dragon, and Blue Flame rolls.

But, Ari was closed last week when I had an afternoon craving, so I thought I'd give EE another chance.

BIG mistake and waste of $25.

I order tempura and sushi to go.  The sushi was beyond aromatic (smelly) and the seaweed wraps were so stale, I couldn't get my canines to rip through it to even chew the food.  The tempura was made in what seemed like pancake batter, it was so heavy and unappealing.  How hard is it to screw up something fried?  Ask EE.

I remembered a number of dead wasps or flies on the windowsill beside me. Ever since then, I dreaded going back. It was not pleasant being in a cafe that wasn't so clean (chilling with the wasps, does that sound like a good cafe experience to you?).

But second time was the charm when I came in, impressed with how full the cafe was. The previous year I went, there were a lot fewer customers. However, despite being full, the cafe was quiet as people worked away or kept their nose behind the newspaper. And no more bugs on the windowsill! Yayy!

To get in touch with its Latin American roots, El Cafecito offers dancing lessons after the cafe closes down and changes the place into a dance floor. They have tango every Wednesday and salsa every Thursday between 7 PM to 10/11 PM. So if you are looking for something new to try, why not with some fun dance lessons to bring out your inner dancing queen/king? With some coffee on the side of course.

Overall, I think this is a sweet place for people who would like to study or work in peace but still be surrounded by people (does that make sense?). It's one of the reasons why I whole-heartedly love cafes: in order to work with an environment full of people.

I was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20/person. The lasagna was awesome - of course I didn't try everything because I was there for the pizza, after all.

The pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. The ""Portuguese"" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion.

The room is long and narrow, and feels like a cross between a classic diner and an upscale train dining car. Waiters bustle around the tight space creating a fun, busy atmosphere.

We sat at the bar. No reservations are taken but we walked right in at 6:00.

We started with beef tartare and fried smelts. The tartare was good and went well with the fresh horseradish included. Smelts were crispy and lightly battered. A nice surprise were the fried jalapenos that went surprisingly well with the fish. The real star though was the free cheesy toast and butter.

The mains were absolutely delicious. The cornish hen was cooked perfectly crispy and was an umami explosion with mushrooms and spinach, but could have used a tiny bit more salt and/or sauce. The burger with fried cheese on top was fantastic. Now that the Harbord Room is closed I think this is now my favourite restaurant burger in Toronto.

For dessert we had the apple pie sundae and a cup of strong coffee.

Service was impeccable. My wife was given samples of two wines to compare when she couldn't decide, a touch that I always appreciate. The wine list could be a bit more extensive but this is a quibble. A fantastic new spot. We will be back.",2017-12-29 15:35:07

People have said that the menu was downsized but the only thing I could find that was greek was Gyros, Falafel and dolmades and souvlaki and I went with the Gyro. The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. The fries were on a greasiness level of their own. I have never had such soggy fries.

After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. 

A few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  

I called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.

A month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.

Tonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.

It's got a huge outdoor seating area, comfortable and modern red-and-black-cushioned patio furniture and back-lit bar that looks very Miami as the sun goes down. The chill-out music sounding from the speakers adds to that 'sit-here-and-chillax-for-as-long-as-you-want' vibe.

Prices are a bit steep for this area (like I said, think King West!) but the staff is super-attentive and the food portions are a good size.  They've got some creative sushi rolls (try the Canadian, wrapped in bacon) and tasty tempura appetizers. It would be great if you could order Fran's brunch on the rooftop patio on a Saturday or Sunday morning...I hope that is in the works!

The lounge is pretty new, so it was quiet, but I can see it picking up once word gets around. The place is called Screen Lounge because at dusk, they screen old black and white movies on the patio - complete with old fashioned popcorn machine, should you get a craving.",2011-07-28 13:52:43

The diverse French cuisine will appeal to Francophiles, and the comprehensive wine selection will appeal will oenophiles.

The French have always done brunch well (partially due to their social belief that drinking after 12 pm is acceptable, even admirable).  Marche Bacchus is my favorite place to go in Vegas for a brunch that makes me forget I live in the Mojave dessert.  Also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.

If it's spring in Vegas, I order the Moules Frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that Marche does well; don't forget the Mimosa.  

If it's summer, I order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a Riesling from the market; the sweetness of the Riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.  

If it's fall, I order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it's a calorie splurge but completely worth it.  

And if it's winter, I get the Les Oeufs En Meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it's a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of Cotes Du Rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it's Vegas harsh dry winter.

Dessert is their weakness.  I haven't fallen in love with any Marche Bacchus sweets; although I daydream about imported truffles from La Maison Du Chocolat or Patrick Roger whenever I visit.",2010-11-22 04:06:25

The seats are comfy and the booths are roomy (fluffy friendly). And each table is equipped with a tablet that lets you order drinks, appetizers, desserts, and your meal (or you could just wait for your server but it is a time saving tool for sure)- and pay. 

The food is hot and fresh! You can customize your burger order with a variety of buns which is a plus and they offer bottomless fries AND broccoli. Kinda nice that they offer healthier options but I'll stick with the steak fries. Be sure to sprinkle the table-side seasoning on your fries too for the extra kick in flavor.

1. Cookies and cream cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with hot fudge on top

2. Peanut butter cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut with butter pecan and Heath bar bits

3. Chocolate chip cookie white chocolate macadamia nut salted caramel fudge ice cream with Heath bar pieces

The ice cream is rich and thick.  The cookies are satisfactory. The chocolate chip was similar to a basic  Toll House recipe. Which I find rather boring   The blandness of that type of cookie is a good platform for the ice cream 

The strawberry cheesecake ice cream had chunks of strawberry cheesecake in it. The taste was excellent 

The butter pecan was lacking in flavour ..... Would give that flavour a miss next time

The real winner was the salted caramel fudge ice cream. The caramel was so warm and inviting and then the super huge chunks of fudge were amazing. 

The heath bar tipping added that extra toffee taste the was ""the icing on the cake""

The fudge on the strawberry cheesecake combo didn't add much to the dessert. Also made it near impossible to pick up. Although ordered on the side (if possible ) and dunking the cookie ice cream creation sounds rather like a good option.

His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  

A friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. 

  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. 

  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.

20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.

I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  

Sorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune.",2010-08-20 22:26:25

The music they play is really good, but loud..which we enjoyed. It's busy, but not so busy that you have to sit and wait forever. I've gotten the brown bag chicken sandwich and the Windsor burger. While the brown bag has all the amazing ingredients to make an amazing choice, it lacks just a little bit of flavor and is a little dry and ""herby"" tasting for my liking. The burger however, is amazing. The sweet potatoes and fried okra are delicious as well. Four peaks pumpkin porter is a seasonal and we had that and the Sam Smith's cider.  (Two of my favorites).

On a lovely holiday Monday, after some frisbee in the park, some friends and I decided we needed some food.  The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.  The criteria being: patio, beer and tasty food.  
Well, it had two of the three, however, those two were not enough to redeem this place, especially in light of the laughably awful service.
Now, I'll admit that three of the people in our party got their food and enjoyed it.  However, two of us were not so lucky.  
First we were given the wrong food.  The one other person who ordered at the same time as us (we sort of ordered in two shifts) got his food.  They took back our messed up orders, with the excuse that the computer wasn't working and thus the orders were messed up...uh okay.  Twenty minutes later we recieved the food we ordered, just as our friend was finishing his meal.  Unfortunately, my greek salad came topped with fetid feta cheese and the caesar wrap came complete with bugs squished on the lettuce.  
The good news was that the food was comped.  However, it took us a little too long to pay as the debit machine phone line was being used by a disgruntled employee to complain about her employment situation and to utter expletives in that regard.

I just wanted to change my nail color (shellac) so I called and asked how much would it be and the guy said $20 so once I got there I picked out a color and told her I wanted silver glitter on the top. She picked out the glitter that was more pricey and didn't even tell me it would be another $5 charge.. I knew it was gonna be extra $5 because I get my nails done all the time & usually get that kind of glitter so I didn't mind but I feel like they should tell a customer ahead of time if there will be more additional charges.. and so when it came to paying she charged me $30 to just change the color without a manicure.. I asked her I thought it was $25 for shellac nail color change & the glitter and she made up some excuse which I couldn't even understand. So I will not be coming to this salon again because they just make up there own prices depending on the customer... 
Other than the lady being kinda rude and not talkative, the guys that work there are more talkative and friendly so if you go there make sure you go to the guys instead of that lady..",2016-01-17 06:23:03

I didn't know that for a long time and I'm disappointed that I spent so much money buying my liquor at supermarkets.  Now that I've discovered Total Wine it is pretty much my sole stop for not only wine but beer (I am incredibly non-loyal to beer brands, I like to try new beers from all of the world).  I also stock up on my hard alcohol at Total Wine and have recently discovered they have a decent selection of cigars.

The store is pleasant, with kind of a woodsy warehouse feeling to it.  Most of the staff are knowledgeable and pleasant.  The prices across the board are reasonable.  They have long hours and tons of parking.  Maybe the only slight downside is they chose to locate in Desert Ridge, which is not a mall that is easy to just pop in to.  I think Desert Ridge is more suited to stores like Target, to the movie theaters, and to the food court than to a food/liquor store that I might want to go to for one or two items every few days.",2012-11-06 17:17:16

The first time I sampled some bites from Savoy was at a Yelp event last year; unfortunately it took me quite a long time to make my way back, but I after the meal I had last week I think the wait was worth it. I went here for dinner with a family member on a Wednesday night - as a result the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. After checking our coats (this is more or less mandatory as they don't let you drape them over the chairs) we were seated at one of their comfy downstairs lounge tables, and we explored the menu, ordered, and proceeded to enjoy an excellent meal.

Firstly, there was the fresh free bread with oil and balsamic for dipping. I was quite hungry so this was a great start. One note, though - beware the spicy bread! We're pretty sure jalapenos were baked into a couple pieces. Tasty for some, not ideal for people like me though.

Then there was the drinks. My dining companion ordered a blackberry Cosmo (made with ingredients like blackberry moonshine - quite a nice touch), and I ordered the Starburst. Both of these drinks were superb; the Cosmo was a first-rate drink and oddly enough, my Starburst did indeed remind me of Starburst candies - but was still muuuuch tastier!

As for the food - just, YUM! My companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. The salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. More restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! As for me, I ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. I have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. The result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. The entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup I'd sampled and fallen in love with already. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered.

The clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. All in all we thought Savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere.

We found a seat immediately and our server was over shortly thereafter, told us the wing/beer special, took our drink order and off she went.
When she returned, we ordered our dinner and some appetizers. Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all.
Some of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless.
When our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minutes later, those wings were brought back out, with the other 3 wing orders. WTF?
Wings were a huge disappointment. While meaty, they were sprinkled with minimal sauce....no  flavour at all. We would have sent them back but we never saw our waitress until 20 minutes later....she was serving other tables, on the phone, settling bills, etc.

I'm not saying that in any sort of negative way at all either. They've got a really solid collection of recent issues as well as graphic novels. Their manga section is so-so, their toys are slim, but what taints my experience here is the back issues selection. I was looking for some issues of Fathom and could not for my life find anything. The girl at the cashier was really great and friendly as she tried to help me find what I was looking for, but even she commented on how disorganized those boxes were.

We stopped in for lunch and neither of us had ever had Ethiopian food before.  I had read about them on their website and in many of the reviews here on yelp, so I kind of knew what to expect.  We were seated immediately, but it took about 10 minutes for our server to greet us.  We immediately ordered two of the lunch specials which we had brought out on one big plate, and it came out super fast!

Everything was wonderful!  We had a lot of fun eating with the Injera and trying to decide which dish was our favorite.  We tried all six of the vegetarian items listed on the lunch menu.  My favorite was probably the Azifah (the cold lentil dish).  The Misir Wat (red split lentils) was really good too, and my mom's favorite was the Fosolia (lightly spiced green beans).  When the big dish was set in front of us, we looked at it and thought, this isn't very much food....but boy were we wrong.  We couldn't even finish it.  The Injera really fills you up I think!

The ambiance is bright and colorful, with high ceilings, lots of windows, and an impressive bar.  But the tables were packed in pretty tight.  Hey, I understand why.  The place was full on a Tuesday night!  If you can cram that many people into a space, and they still want to come, then it's just smart business.  But it isn't my taste.

My wife and I decided to try as many dishes as we could, so we shared a menu made up of appetizers and side dishes.  Our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.

Some dishes were what you might call ""just fine"":  The chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  The goat cheese queso fundido was better than ""just fine.""  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  The smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.

So, Mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.  But when we go to a high end, pricey restaurant we really want nothing less than five stars, and Mesa doesn't quite get there.  Lots of Vegas restaurants do get there.  So we won't be back at Mesa for a while.  Sorry, Bobby.  We'll catch you at Bar Americain next time we're in New York.",2015-11-18 18:59:44

Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order ""Britney Spears""? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.

Anyway, I've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their ""church basement pierogies."" They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.

The downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).

The restaurant was pretty empty,  but they stated they had other reservations.  I never saw a group of 8 come,  so. ..our table should have been available anyway.  We would have ordered many more drinks but instead we had one, two at the most.  The guy that finally decided to sit us was not very nice,  and rudely said ""come on!

The food,  great, guacamole and queso fundido were tasty. The tacos great as expected, the mijito, though  not on the menu was well done. We came during happy hour,  but when checks came the bill didn't reflect that. The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked about it.  We are by no means a difficult or demanding group. So I am inclined to think it's an attitude issue on their part. I was  completely done with the experience when a plate load crashes on the floor. It falls from the hands of one of servers. It was literally next to us,  soooo loud,  pieces flying,  and not a word to apologize or something!? We weren't offered desert and at that point I was too bothered to stay longer.  I said bye and thank you as I walked out,  but there was no response from the staff.

The fianceÂ´ and I have come to Okra twice now, and both times we've sat at the bar (everyone knows the bar is the best place in any restaurant). Let me just narrow down this review to our latest experience (hub's bday - and btw, I know he's not my hubs yet, but it's way easier and a lot less annoying to type, IMO).

Some highlights: the bartenders are so nice and SO talented. Their juleps are to die for!

Next, the apps: you shouldn't come here if you're not planning on getting appetizers. Just turn around and go home. The Fried Chicken Skins are unreal. Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.

On to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.

Lastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...

The pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).

The donut and pure caramel heaven. It's drenched (not drizzled) in the most delectable caramel sauce I've ever tasted, with just a pinch of sea salt to top it off. *drooling*

One pro tip before you come to Okra, since you're obviously making a reservation this very minute: it's a little hard to find. The sign is on 7th so you might be tempted to pull into the parking lot where it is, but you have to turn down Palo Verde (small side street) to get to it - it'll be on your left.",2016-06-22 20:42:59

BTW:I apologize for my lackluster previous review.  When I first discovered yelp I went for quantity, not quality.

So this place used to be Jack Straw's which was probably THE best music venue the the town has ever ""scene"".  Well its not that place anymore.  Its still worth visiting and has more than just a bar or restaurant vibe to it.  On nice sunny days the deck is beautiful.

We had a going away party for a friend today.  We made reservations for 30 for Sunday brunch.  Only place in town with a mimosa deal that would take a crowd like us.  You would think that they would maybe tell a couple of extra servers to come in at least for the hour or 2 we were there.  We had 2 servers for our group and they also had other tables.  They did well, but felt I pretty bad for the other tables.

The brunch menu was large, but mostly it was just slight variations on eggs and meat with some major exceptions.  It was a cheaply made paper menu, but the one thing that stood out ""the hangover"" which was a breakfast sandwich on a doughnut.  But, they don't serve it anymore, even though it was on this cheaply made menu.  I tasted many peoples dishes, they were good but over priced.  Everything was roughly $9 except for biscuits and gravy and french toast.  Although, the $2 mimosa's and $4 bloody mary's is hard to beat.

1. This is not the place to come for authentic Chinese cuisine. Abort mission if that's your goal. Go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand.

2. This is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. You will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. 

Seriously - these folks put up with a lot. A LOT. Can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? It'd be like babysitting 100 children with ADHD who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. So I chose to cut them some slack.

3. I liken this to being the Denny's of Chinese food. It is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. You love it while your eating it. You tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it.

But in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. If you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive.

4. On a diet? Yeah, no. Not for you.

Yes, I too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the Beltline. I have slithered their noodles down my throat and I have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. I literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time.

I've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. The place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. Now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. Just make sure you bring CASH. They get a bit ornery if you try to pay with Debit/Credit.

Pro tip: Stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. You might get dirty looks, but I've never been yelled at - yet. Mmmmm, 5 pounds of Calgary's finest imitation Asian cuisine. 

Is 4 stars probably pushing it? Yes. If I could I'd give them a 3.5. But as someone else mentioned, Calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved Alphaghetti.",2011-11-30 07:11:58

Got some sort of sandwich, let's go with curry and lime pickle and chickpea spread - and damn, it was awesome. A slider by way of Punjab. Killer.

Prices are low to mid - and there are things being made here that you can't get anywhere else, plus the classics are fab - samosas, two huuuuge pastry-covered piles of fennel seed, potato, unidentifiable delish, for 3 bucks. A garlicy, smoky dal, multiple legumes, a cup or so of Paneer Masala, a perfect amount of rice, papadum, and thin, pancake-like Naan, for 7. Sweet.",2011-05-27 15:16:31

I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer, & the Meatballs & Spaghetti as the main course, however, as a vegetarian, I asked for just spaghetti marinara -- no meatballs!

First out was a small salad, which comes with the entree.  It was good.  Next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   The onion rings were pretty greasy, as I suppose most are, so I'm not complaining, however I do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully I'll be home by then!   I do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something! 

The pasta course was good.  Instead of them bringing Parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   Also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.

I was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of Meatballs & Spaghetti ($8.99) since I asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, I was charged full price.

My bottom line:  Decent food at an OK price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (I don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- I came here because I was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and I don't see a reason to return.

Believe you me, I love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but I avoid the Eaton Centre like the plague. Oh Eaton Centre, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:

1) Teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. The layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). 

2) It is said that ""variety is the spice of life."" Consider that the Eaton Centre has 3 Aldos, 2 Bell Worlds, 2 Feet Firsts, 2 Nutrition Houses, and 2 Sunglass Huts, to name a few. Is this really necessary? Is it a secret ploy by the city of Toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? 

3) The one redeeming quality of the Eaton Centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. Parking is expensive. Hordes of people travelling to and from Dundas and Queen stations and the PATH converge here. Trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  

4) The washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. High demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.

For decent mall shopping, Yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores.",2011-05-27 21:08:20

I saw all the reviews and decided to go with the Guacamole sampler.   We got an original, crab, and pineapple habanero as our choices.  Original was just regular old plain guac.  I wouldn't get that again.  Not with so many different choices to choose from.  Next, the crab didn't do it for me.  My wife liked it, though.  So if you don't like seafood in your guac like me skip the seafood options.  My favorite was the pinapple habanero.  Simply outstanding.  Next time I may opt for just 1 guac and some salsas.

My wife ordered the pork carnitas and I had the hanger steak.  Both meals were completely cooked to perfection and was more than enough food for dinner.  Heck, the guac was more than enough.

I ordered coffee and jalapeno bread pudding for dessert.  Coffee made with cinnamon and brown sugar?  Was amazing.  The bread pudding had the jalapeno taste without the bite.  Was also to do for.  I highly recommend it.

50 Public Square
Cleveland, OH 44113

If you ever find yourself in Cleveland, you cant go without visiting the Tower City Center. This Historic land mark used to be know as the Cleveland Union Terminal and signs of its history are everywhere. 

This unique center is connected to two hotels (Ritz Carlton & Renaissance) a huge casino (Horseshoe), an 11-screen movie theater, 100 shops, 6 restaurants, and  Cleveland's mass transit system. (RTA). They also have connected walkways to Progressive Field, and Quicken Loans Arena.

The Skylight Concourse is definitely something to see; this four story (+) tall atrium overlooks the Cuyahoga river hosting a food court and cinema. Here you can grab some stir-fried veggies at Sakkio Japan, Bourbon Chicken at Kelly's Cajun Grill, or just a warm pretzel from Auntie Anne's while enjoying the scenery of  downtown Cleveland and Ohio City.

The holidays at Cleveland City Center is truly a sight to see. In December they have a 40ft tall Christmas tree with larger than life hanging mechanical ornaments, Gingerbread village, and the best thing ever, the Twigbee Shop! Here you can bring kids under 12 with their shopping list for parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles and a volunteer helps the little ones buy gifts under $10 that are pre-wrapped. 

Besides all the cool shops, you can truly just get lost in this place and enjoy the sights and sounds. Eat, drink, shop, eat, drink, shop... How can you go wrong with that. If all else fails, go blow your shopping money at the casino.

One of my favorite amenities at City Center is the subway. Cleveland's RTA rumbles below the center giving you the feel a bustling metropolis. Here you can jump the sub and go pretty much anywhere you want in the city, and the mall resembles an oldtyme train station. Just the architecture alone draws me in, I can spend an entire day meandering the halls, people watching, sipping coffee and munching on some delicious treats.

Tower City Center is a safe, clean, and fun place to take the kids, watch a movie, or blow your paycheck, just remember to get your parking ticket validated.",2013-10-03 13:18:24

The staggeringly bad choices for Asian food around Moon / Sewickley are just all around.  

Since I live nearby, I hit this place as a default setting.  Kung Pao Chicken ($11) and Shrimp Toast ($7.95).  It adds up in a hurry and by the end of the meal, you wonder, ""Where did it all go?""  Or if you are feeling a little on the existential side, ""Is that all there is?""

For the price, the Kung Pao Chicken tastes cheap and rubbery.  On the good side, you get plenty of this cheap and rubbery chicken.  Flavor is just meh.  A bit on the bland side sometimes.

The Shrimp Toast is OK.  Most times I have ordered this, it comes burnt.

Since it's mostly pizza places that deliver to our house, Hunan is the only non-pizza option that delivers.  If I order Kung Pao and Shrimp Toast, I easily get to the $15 minimum delivery threshold.  But, in the end, I should have just driven myself to Leetsdale or Robinson for something better.

Our waitress was also very patient as we perused the menu over and over each time to decide what we wanted. Running staff was attentive at refilling our water glasses regularly but the one odd thing was our soy sauce bottle was replaced...three times. THREE! The first bottle was half empty, the second 3/4 full and the 3rd completed filled. It wasn't obtrusive to our meal, just comical.

I ordered the Chick'n Pot Pie with a market salad on a side, and a Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake. Overall, I was pleased with my order. This is a restaurant I'd try again. I gave 4/5 stars for the great pot pie. I wish the price was cheaper though but it's understandable since most vegan restaurants have this price point. See details on the food below!

Chick'n Pot Pie = 4/5 
I really enjoyed this one. When it arrived, it was a bit warm, which is expected since it was delivery. I bet if I had this in the restaurant it would have been hot, comforting, and perfect. It had potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, red bell pepper, beans, peas, and a nice crust. I wish it had more chick'n though. The salad had spinach, shredded beets, red bell pepper, tomatoes, cucumbers, and balsamic vinaigrette. It was definitely filling and I'd order it again.

Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake = 2.5/5
This was a fancier banana bread. The size reminds me of those school safe banana bread snacks you can get from Costco. It basically tastes like that - sweet. I was disappointed with this one since I found it pricey for what reminded me of a school snack. I thought it would be a slice of cake, but it looks just like that snack.

Service was very fast and staff are friendly. They close at 10 and we were staying because the show on their tv ends at 10. We hurried to get our bill but they were like, that's ok the show isn't over, feel free to stay. Like how nice is that! 

Dishes came promptly too, meaning that the dishes were hot when they arrived. Yay! 

Decor is... Well, let's just say this isn't a place you'd want to set a candle lit dinner. But I mean it's a HK diner so what were y'all expecting? 

OKAY SO THE FOOD. Cheap, and big portions! I love that they have enough toppings for my udon. Actually, they gave a lot and I'm so glad. Their fish in cream sauce on rice was great and very cheesy. My fav! Also, their pork and chicken chop with garlic sauce on rice qas great too. The sauce wasn't too strong. It was aromatic and delicious. 

But lemme tell you about the satay chicken udon I had. Oh my goodness. So many toppings and they had strips of green and red pepper to help complicate the taste. The noodles weren't oily. You could actually taste the gusto the chef put in when he was cooking this delectable dish in his wok. Oh my gosh. Definite 5/5.

And then! We had free dessert! It was my fav. I have to say, this is a very unique recipe of coconut sago and I love it. This coconut sago has taro chunks and egg. The egg was the truly unique bit because it actually made the dessert feel smoother and it made the whole thing more aromatic. Usually I despise taro with every fibre of my being but not today! My mom even said this may be the only time I did not puke at taro. 

My dinner was $9.50, came with a hot drink (I chose lemon water), a soup (I chose cream of veg but they also have Chinese soup), and if you're lucky, a dessert. What a deal, especially with the amount of food i got! 

If you're a skeptic of HK diners like I am, please come to this place for dinner. It will change your mind. I will definitely come back. I mean this isn't my first time here, lol.",2017-05-26 02:13:09

We walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!

I enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!

My minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. 

Their side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.

This restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.

The location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop.

Admittedly, I have a tough time getting up and getting dressed on the weekends, so I'm not much of a brunch connoisseur.  That being said, their ""best brunch in town"" claims may not be that far from the truth.

I ordered the stuffed French toast, which featured two LARGE slices of sourdough bread, stuffed with mascarpone cheese, and topped with enough maple syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream to put me into a sugar coma for the rest of the day.  Coming with a side of bacon, I couldn't ask for anything more.

Their brunch menu isn't extensive, but what they lack in options they make up for with pure quality, both in the ingredients they use and portion sizes they present.  My stuffed French toast left me entirely stuffed and very, very happy.

It's definitely on the pricier side ($13 for my meal, $15 for the plate my boyfriend ordered), but when I'm raving about the food to my coworkers on Monday morning, you know it's totally worth it.

I'm not as smitten with the service (we were starving and it was a little on the slow side), but everyone was friendly enough, and I will most definitely be back in the very near future.",2012-09-10 14:25:55

Anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). There were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. Let me say upon arrival of our food I was shocked by how generous the portions were! The Khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. And the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. Very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. We both loved the food. The khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. I needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. Their sauces are really tasty btw. They come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.

Macon Wild, the rep. who assisted us at Enterprise, helped us get into a car better than we had ever expected to get.  In a nutshell, she made it as painless as possible, and we walked out extremely happy.

   After my wife's car accident, I was dreading going through the process.  I don't like to feel pressured and obligated to buy from a sales person, especially in regards to something as big as a new car, and would rather bow out than give in.  However, Macon was awesome for us; she had an awesome personality, knew exactly what we wanted and didn't try to deviate from that into something else, and seemed to really help us and understand what we said we could afford when it came down to financing.

   If I were to be completely honest, some of the others that had tried to help seemed to put the pressure on us when we were getting down to the nitty-gritty business of financing, and I almost backed out.  If it hadn't been for Macon and her partner in crime, Alex Woodford, it may not have happened.  Those two were so awesome, patient and understanding about how I needed time to review the information and consider everything before making the final decision.  Between my hesitation and thorough research, I ended up delaying the process for about over a week or more, but because of their patience and just awesomeness all around, we walked out with a better car than I had even expected in the end.

I don't know if they imagine themselves as Dexter and lay out their tools right in front of you while looking at your eyes to see which you're most terrified at.  This is why I haven't trusted a Dental office in so many years, but with Cheyenne Dental Group I found one I can really trust.

Setting up an appointment is easy but finding an open spot to be seen is hard, so get your appointments in.  For example and most recently I called Wednesday night close to closing to be seen for a quick checkup and the next available was on Tuesday at 3pm(!) ugh, with Monday being a holiday.  But with great service comes great demand.

I then met Dr. Tounian whom assessed and had recommendations on work that needed to be done.  No pressure at all on what I needed and wanted.  My insurance isn't the best but they worked with me on getting the necessary work done as well.  

Now lets talk about the treatment.  The assistants and staff were nice but my duel was against Dr. Lisa Hoang (spelling?) and faith was put into her hands.  She did an excellent job and explained what she was going to do and what I might be feeling so I wasn't caught off guard.

Also it didn't seem like they were using binders (egg or breadcrumbs)

The building itself is definitely beautiful, despite the corridors often being crowded. This is especially true near the entrance where the bar is set up and people tend to linger.

At Tomo, when they ask you where you would like to sit, choose the Hibachi grill or the left (left as if you were walking in through the main door). If you sit on the right side, Tomo shares an adjacent wall with a noisy night club, and your table will thump with hip-hop music. This obviously isn't their fault for having noisy neighbors, but it can definitely hinder a first date or good conversation.

This also goes for choosing when to eat there. I recommend Friday night, before the bar crowds start rolling into the neighborhood. You'll find better parking, and it will be a quieter experience. As for the food, the sushi at Tomo is quality for the prices, but be prepared to spend a little more than usual. The presentation is beautiful, and the service is fast considering their busy Warehouse District location. I absolutely love the Indian Roll and the Sexy Girl roll, and I must mention how nice it is to have a hibachi downtown.

Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. 

I ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. ""The anchovy flavor was great."" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go. 

Finally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly.

The second time they came around with the pineapple, to my group of 6, and we were told there were only 3 pieces left at the moment... Every man for himself! Needless to say, I wanted them all..

Service was meh. We initially had reservations made for 9, and didn't actually get seated until almost 9:30. 
It wasn't even a case where they were full and couldn't accommodate - there were multiple empty tables (that seated 6). Yet, we were told to wait, as the server continued to seat others who came after us with later reservations of 9:30. 
It wasn't until we had to press them for our reservation a 3rd time, where we finally got seated - in the corner of the restaurant beside the bar. Not impressed. Not to mention there were still empty tables in the main dining.

The dinner tables and chairs are clearly divided into two colors, beige-ish or dark chocolate-ish, somehow there were no specific color match arrangement or setting, it was a bit random to me.

While the hostess was very nice, our waitress had a I-do-not-want-to-work-on-sundays face, I think that just described enough. My entree was the butternut squash risotto. The presentation of this dish was good at a first sight, but when you look at it closely, I don't understand why the fried almost turned black brussels leaves are floating around, it was oily and tasteless. If you want to add a touch of green to the dish, maybe don't fry it as much so it would stay at green.

When I DimSum, it Ha-Gow.   Pub-Wings.  Italian - Penne Arrabiata.  Steak - NY Strip.  Sushi - California Roll...and Hakka...Chilli Chicken!

I haven't been to a Hakka place in a while.  I used to go regularly to Wok of Asia when I was assigned to a long term project in the area.  Now that I'm stationed near Hakka Bros., it was great to find this place.

As I mentioned, I like to try to the Chilli Chicken when I go to a Hakka place for the first time.  Ordered the CC and Soup special - $5.95+tax.

The Hot and Sour soup was thick and a decent portion for a combo soup.  However, though it had some heat, it didn't have any real flavour.  Added a bit of salt and that helped.

The Chilli Chicken portion was generous.  Not a lot of times that I don't finish my meal but I had to give up as I was going into a food coma!  The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served.  It had nice heat with about the right amount of peppers.  The rice however was a bit of a mess as it smelled off.  The trials and tribulations of going there well after the lunch hour.  

If I had to rank my CC experience, it would be Wok of Asia first, this a close second, Asian Garden, then Hakka 77...dead last...Hakka #1.

Nonetheless, this place is a good find.  Without the Yelp App, it would have been another fast food lunch bag letdown.

This is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Yorkville. For a Tuesday night, it was pretty busy but certainly not full. The food was not bad, not the best I've ever had but definitely above average and the service was pretty good!

I had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which I enjoyed. I notice the list of white wines was a bit smaller. There were a lot more red wine choices and most of the choices were for entire bottles. The prices were a bit on the higher side but it's a beautiful restaurant in Yorkville so that's to be expected.

I had the spinach salad which was good but I found there were too many sweet elements. The salad dressing was a strawberry vinaigrette and there were figs and dried cranberries and some sort of crispy onions and bocconcini cheese. I would have enjoyed a goats cheese or something to cut the sweetness of it. The elements were fresh tasting however. We also ordered the burrata appetizer that came with a sizable ball of burrata cheese and prosciutto on a bed of arugula. The burrata was delicious and the portion was good for the price. 

I had the gnocchi as my main, which while was filling, was a small portion on a huge plate. I saw some other dishes like the lasagna and pizzas and panzerotti and they were a lot larger. Maybe I'd go with one of those options next time. The pasta was also somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the sauce wasn't the best and the ricotta on top didn't really add much to it. 

Since we were there for a birthday, we also got a Nutella pizza to share. I love Nutella so that was good but I found the crust to be really chewy in some parts and burnt in other parts. There were also a total of 5 banana slices on the pizza and a few hazelnuts sprinkles on top. It was a nice after dinner treat but it wasn't amazing. 

The service was pretty good. The food came a bit slow but it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect that. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Modern and warm and stylish. The kitchen is open so you can see the pizzas being made which is really cool.

This is a nice, new, cheery spot located across the street from City Hall, on the first floor of the parking garage right there. A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli.
I had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.  
I used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.  
Overall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.  MTO Cafe is a cool addition to Downtown and nice to have as a dining option there.",2013-12-07 21:59:59

Chile crusted rabbit was excellent - serving portion is manageable, plated with toasted couscous (excellent pairing) and fava beans. Rabbit was perfectly roasted and flavorful, slightly gamey.

THE UP-SIDE:
The food is decent and will definitely fill you up.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This place is downright unsanitary at times.  I've witnessed the person behind the counter rub their coworker's neck (greasy curls falling all over their gloves) and then turn to make my burrito; touching my food with the same gloves.  At other times, I've watched them drag the burrito across the counter top, pulling whatever germs were there along with ""my food.""  On yet another occasion, I witnessed them pulling up a container from behind a burrito belonging to a customer in front of me.  The container dropped a bunch of dirty water onto it.  Needless to say, I watch really carefully now when they make my food.  Also, this location has a few girls working here that are damn annoying; always yelling and laughing to the point of irritation.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Good food but HIGHLY unsanitary at times.  Roll the dice...

UPDATE MONTH'S LATER:  I decided to lower my guard and go here today.  What a mistake.  I ordered the 4 crunchy tacos.  And, where every other decent Chipotle will fill each taco separately - as they indeed should - this one took it to the opposite extreme.  The girl behind the counter was lazy and indifferent. She plopped each of the salsa's on top of the shells, not in them.  By the time she was about to put the lettuce on that I had asked for, I had to stop her.  I said, ""Stop.  Please.  You've completely covered the shells.  I can't even see them any longer.  You've done nothing but make a giant mess that I have to fix up if I'm going to eat a taco that has something in it.""

She got all huffy like, ""Well, I never!""  Too bad.  If nobody tells her that her absolute laziness is making a mess of my meal, she will never change.  (And by the way - it was not busy at the time. In fact, it was nearly dead in there.  She had no good excuse.)

He didn't ask me what I was getting done, he just started to do my nails.  No communication whatsoever.  Then when he asked which color I wanted and started to paint on my soft, raw nails.  I stopped him right there and said, oh, I'm getting a full acrylic set with gel.  I came in with acrylic that he removed with the tool, not even soak them or file them down.

I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and boy was it underwhelming. The noodles were covered in an almost sickeningly sweet ""chili"" sauce. There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.

The menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, ""Asian"", ""Mediterranean"", and ""American"" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.

Overall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success. Probably not the most fair assessment, but we were expecting a brothy Asian noodle hangout and this was far from that.

I rarely get their desserts, not from lack of quality but from lack of room - the food here is extremely filling, even if you split it with a friend like I often to.

He immediately started pressing for me to get a crown that would involve a root canal, tooth shaping and the crown. I told him several times if I had the money I would get a permanent implant, but I can't afford it so how much to just pull it?

Well, then in walks the finance manager (sounds just like a car dealership) She details all the options from crowns to partials. Thousands of dollars she's quoting. I tell her how much for just pulling the damn tooth.

OK, she explains in order to quote that, since I don't have dental insurance I would have to buy a 1 year dental plan through them that would cost $95. That would entitle me to their ""discount"" procedure rate of $300 to pull the tooth. $300!!! plus the $95 plus the initial $39 and I'm looking at almost $450 to pull a simple tooth!

Well, needless to say I said no.

Even though I paid the $39 (demanded up front when I walked in) which was supposed to include a cleaning and free sonic toothbrush, I was offered and received neither. I should have demanded it, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there.

The XL pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom texture that was not overly oily with every bite.

So my 4 stars are taking in the assumption that this is what it SHOULD taste like and that is delicious, minus the white tea I drank, but that was my fault.  

This past Saturday I had hit the West Side Market for some shopping and had brought my wife and our new work friend from India that some met at the Yelp party, Mridul.  We decided to come here because we wanted something unique, quick, and easy on the wallet.  I convinced them by showing Cara's review because the wife loves Pad Thai where I personally have never tried it.  Mridul was limited to chicken, chicken, or chicken so PP (Ha) was right down his alley.

For the appetizer we tried the PP Spring Rolls (4) and we all thought those were fantastic.  The peanut dipping sauce went perfectly with the fried chicken / veggie 'smaller version of egg rolls'.  The wife, as predictable as they come, went with the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai mild heat.  This was spot on.  Very tasty, I mean I could eat this 3 days a week for lunch.  It was weird for me to see the whole dish basically reddish orange with sprinkled peanuts and sprouts because I really couldn't tell the difference between the noodles and the carrots.....again, this is my first time here so I quickly realize what a rookie I was.  Mridul went with the Chicken Fried Rice, medium spice, with a scrambled egg inside.  This was really good too, a dish I would recommend if a rice dish is your desire.  I went with the Spicy Pork Pad Thai medium heat for 2 reasons.   1) I originally wanted the chicken but wifey beat me to it and 2) I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference between chicken and pork, which upon tasting, there really was.  Although all dishes were great, we all decided that the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai was our favorites.  We also all decided that the heat needed to be upgraded to the medium level, not mild.  

What a great first time.  I will be back and also want to try Pad Thai somewhere else to see how it compares.  Very cute place, and really reasonable.  Be forewarned though, they only take cash.",2010-11-22 16:34:58

The Captain Hashbrown comes with hash browns, bacon, cheddar cheese, onion, green bell pepper, and egg. Sounds typical except for the onion and green bell pepper (which gives it a little depth and taste much better, as for typical breakfast burritos). But there are 2 key things that make me a fan

1. The egg was cooked like a scrambled egg pancake But  the yolk wasn't cooked through (not runny yolk). This little detail was Brilliant!!

2. I don't know if its the oil or seasoning of the hashbrowns, onions, green peppers but it has a certain goodness to it.. Again, that something brings it another step away from the norm.. Yum!

The food was excellent! We started off with a barbecue octopus appetizer special that was really flavorful and tender. Also, the complimentary baguette they give you is great - not a crusty baguette like I've had to endure many times at other restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the duck entree and I ordered the pork chop. Both were exceptional! Her duck was so tender and moist and was the best duck either of us had ever eaten (albeit both with limited experience). My pork was very good, and the polenta that came with is was awesome. Unfortunately we were stuffed even before dessert, but all the food we tried was very flavorful and cooked just right.
The service was pretty outstanding as well. Multiple different waiters checked on us or took plates, etc. but it was not because our main waiter was inattentive.

OK, so let me start... We ordered a Margarita that was made for 2 people to share. Yes I got drunk off it and yes I had a designated driver. It cost $25 for it but let me tell you it was strong and 48 ounces of heaven. It lasted my whole meal and that was with my man drinking off it too. The downside was as we watched the server at the bar making it she put a toothpick in her mouth that she then put cherries on and then put in our drink. GROSS! I'm totally getting that drink again it was too good. It was called ""The Romance"".

We started with tacos. If you show your local ID after 6 pm Mon-Fri you get up to 4 tacos at 50 cents each. YES just 50 cents each! They were by far the best part of the meal. You can pick between chicken, beef or carnitas.

I had the ""Enchiladas Suizas"" which was very good. It had Chicken, Tamatillo Sauce, Sour Cream, and Salsa. It also came with rice and beans that were full of flavor. I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together. I finally said that I get them that way everywhere else and that is how I would like them. You will see by the picture I posted that they held up just fine :)  This dish cost $15.

My man had the ""Beef Fajitas"" and he ate every bit of it. He didn't like that it had corn grilled in with the veggies but he will know for next time to tell them to leave that off. This dish cost $19.

My mans Dad had the ""Chili Relleno""  and this cost $16. He really enjoyed it.

Although I do not subscribe to an organic lifestyle anymore, I do appreciate it and do like having options.

I came to Sharky's with a friend for an early dinner and ordered the Wild Salmon Lite Burrito. It's a wheat burrito filled with grilled wild salmon (not farmed), poblano organic brown rice, nori seaweed, cucumber, avocado and chili sesame seed oil. On it's own it is a bit bland but the salsa bar has a lot of different salsa to make that salmon burrito your very own. I tried different salsas and all of them were fresh and really kicked my burrito a few notches. 

The burrito was very filling and I ate only half of it but maybe I was talking to my friend and got distracted.

Sat down and was greeted by a pretty girl in a cute outfit who really knows her way around a bar. Inquired about all the tasty margaritas and she explained which was tart, which was sweet, mellow, etc. Super helpful stuff there. Also threw some chips and salsa in front of me that alerted the tasted buds that delicious stuff was on the way. Thanks for the heads up, sexy, salty chips!

I ended up with two different margaritas. The first was a passion fruit margarita, which was fine, don't get me wrong, but it was nothing like the next one I had. Whew. Was talking to Michelle, I think that was her name, and she recommended I try the verano de jalisco. I am a huge fan of cilantro and added to this drink it made it fresh and delicious. The unusual salt (can't remember the name) around the rim just made it all the better. Do these!

I then had a side of elotes asados and it was sooooo freaking good. The plate was piled so high I couldn't eat it all. I should have eaten it all because now I want some and I realized how much I wasted. Regret.

I also ordered a side of homefries for $3, which were equally good. Two other things...

Soju was presented in a Patron bottle which was a nice/cool touch; BUT, the bottle was soooooo sticky. Obviously because it spilled out when being poured in.

X8v2uXm3_rppWzcQRgnuQQ,LHdpvgOYNQj4Jo-K51Bf6g,AUp7fTAH7PwxecdSO_iAhw,1,2,1,0,"California Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. 

Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. 

Recently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. 

The pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. 

So we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.",2011-08-24 23:50:01

After a fun afternoon of day drinking my boyfriend and I decided we needed to fill our bellies with delicious pho and drunken noodles. I've been wanting to try this place because of the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted by the owner and a very friendly order taker (Leslie). We were sad to find out they had just run out of broth for the pho and were also out of the drunk AF noodles. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we ended up trying a variety of other equally delicious foods.  

First up we ordered The Big Wang and it was awesome.  It came on a huge baguette and was loaded with strips of tender beef, cucumbers, a spicy (but not too spicy) Wang sauce), and Asian slaw. Side note: The Big Wang was listed as the top 11 best sandwiches you must try in Nevada. I can see why, seriously!

I wanted to try the Bang Bang Sliders and figured they would be little appetizer sized. Umm wrong, they were HUGE! Set between soft pretzel bread these sliders were overflowing with tender pulled pork, siam slaw, cukes and onions, and that tasty Wang sauce. You get 3 large sliders so plenty to take home.

Leslie recommended the Bangkok Burrito and we thought hey why not? Another excellent choice. This monstrously huge burrito came stuffed with curry chicken, chicken fat rice, and bamboo shoots. Again we could only eat about a third of it and in the take out box the rest went.  

We were brought an order of Dirty chips on the house since they were out of the Pho and Drunk AF noodles.  They were like Asian nachos, were delicious, and we ate the whole damn thing with no apologies. Leslie also brought us samples of the homemade ice cream. My boyfriend liked the cereal milk flavor the best but passion fruit was my favorite. Total bill came to $38 but we easily got 2 meals out the deal. We're definitely coming back to try the Pho and drunken noodles soon! Like as in tomorrow.

This place really is ""Phoking"" Phonomenal!!",2017-01-27 19:50:27

The employees were not friendly nor rude. They were just... there. However, the lady who brought out our to-go bag was really nice. Most of the ice cream flavors were ""OUT"" (written in chalk on their massive menu board). This was 2 hours before closing so that might have had something to do with it. Still, there were some flavors that I would have loved to try but was unable to and that was disappointing.

They have metal spoons for the ice cream samples - that was unique and something I've never seen before.

Sampled the Turkish Coffee and French Toast ice cream, both were yummy but the french toast won (hands down!!!).

I just realized that I wasn't offered the little ""sample"" scoop on top of my french toast ice cream. I'll be sure to ask for it when I go next time. Seems kind of odd that I have to ask though. If that's their ""thing"", they should offer it to every customer, each time ice cream is ordered. Oh well.

My husband and I also bought fries. He ordered the cheddar bacon fries - pretty tasty with lots of cheese and bacon bits and 1 side of ranch.

I ordered the chicken tenders and fries which came with 1 side of honey mustard (which tasted more like mustard with a hint of honey). A boring and safe choice and it tasted, well... boring and safe.

The fries are rather expensive for what they are though. The pictures of the pizza fries look good but the price, along with it being extra $$$ for pepperoni (wth?), I will surely pass.

I will most likely make my way back for the ice cream, but not for the fries unless I'm starving and nothing else around seems appetizing. The fries are pretty good (well, my husband's were) but they are just too expensive and they aren't anything wondrous.

Up close, it's a different story.

Up close, it just makes me sad.  I feel sad because if tourists come here from other countries and base their opinion of the US solely on what they see on the Strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes.  

I know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.

Another thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for ""dates"" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?

I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  

My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal...

The rest were quite good. I particularly liked the chef sushi and Mexican role. 
One small disappointment was the staff didn't remind me that if I ordered 25$ or more u get a. Futumakis free. Ive been to other shops and alway was told when my order was clearly over. Once I paid I let them know it was cool that it wasn't mentioned.

They made the rolls with avocado so they had to remake it. I felt bad but I asked them for no avocado when I ordered because I'm allergic. Also, the spicy tuna roll was not spicy but lukewarm. 

Dined at the bar and one of the chefs were right in front of us the whole time...he wasn't even the one that took our order or made the sushi. It was really awkward because only 4 of 8 bar seats were taken with guests and he was just standing there watching us eat. Ah, so weird. There must be something else you could be doing...

The bento came out and the beef was good. They forgot to bring out the rice and when they did it was a little on the dry side.

I am sad to see a local spot gone but the family that owns this place is cute. I feel like they just opened a place to serve food they make at home. They claim to be a Vietnamese and Chinese spot but I didn't see much Chinese except for the fried rices.

It has a typical Vietnamese menu minus the curries. I did however see they offered a beef stew with bread yum.

Basically the food was good, the place was clean, and the service was polite. They could do to stop by the tables more often except to drop food off but I enjoyed all of the staff I encountered. Very sweet and friendly. 

We tried their combo pho $8x 2, a ban mi dac biet $3 and some change, and their spring rolls $3. All came out to $24 and some change. We were stuffed. It was a bargain IMO.

I really liked their sandwich. Their bread was hot, fresh, and crunchy. I've never had one like that. I want to say they didn't put the patte part. I have to say I didn't miss it, and I've been eating those sandwiches since my childhood. At first it looked like they skimped on meat but it was perfect. I loved it.

Their pho was good. It was a good size with a large amount of meat. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked just right, and it was served super hot. The bowl looked below average in size but it was just the right amount. I finished the whole bowl and the broth. 

Their spring rolls were good. The dipping sauce was good. I enjoyed them. 

I have to say for a newer place I thought they did a great job. If they are reading and I could help them improve I'd say to offer straws for their water, get a napkin dispenser for the table if they don't plan to walk by too much, and lastly take their service to the next level. 

Overall I do plan on returning soon. In comparison to a Pho Kim Long, Pho Saigon, or Pho So 1 it is just as good but with the friendly staff you won't find in China Town.

   I am sorry we got off on the wrong foot... I was all wrong about you! I am so happy that I decided to give you a second chance, and you beyond redeemed yourself! If you read my first review I didn't have such a stellar experience, It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't what I was expecting! So, I was hoping that the second time around would be better and it was!

This time around we went and ordered another bottle of my now favorite wine Sexual Chocolate, it's a Syrah - Zinfandel blend and it's frankly to die for. The bottle runs around $65.00 and they offer it by the glass as well at I believe $16.00.  This go around we decided to order an assortment of their appetizers, and I was frankly blown away by nearly all of them. The only one I wouldn't order again would be the Spicy Tuna Pops. The tuna itself was amazing, super fresh and really flavorful. The waffle cone that it arrived in didn't exactly compliment the fish. 

Other items that we ordered and LOVED were the dozen oysters, we got an assortment of the oysters they had that particular day and they were fresh and this time around there wasn't a trace of shell in any of the oysters! WOOHOO!

The Crispy Cuttlefish was one of my fav items that evening - The only way to describe it is that it is very similar to calamari but frankly it's better than calamari. It doesn't have that rubbery texture to it and it was fried to perfection and the lemon aioli was the perfect compliment to it. 

Cuttlefish's take on a wedge salad is what dreams are made of! I love wedge salads but I usually am not a huge fan of the iceberg lettuce since it really has zero taste or nutritional value to it. The bibb lettuce was a welcome change of pace and the crispy pancetta, and avocado was a nice  addition. 

The pork  belly, the Carlsbad Mussels, Shrimp and grits I could just go on and on! Had the opportunity to meet Joey one of the owners who was very friendly, and I was really impressed when I learned that he actually cooks in the kitchen there. I love that he is a hands on owner and it shows that he has a real investment in the establishment!

If you are into pho you must try this soup as its different yet flavour is out of this world!  A bowl of soup on a cold fall-winter day is an amazing way to warm up the body. They also offer a hot chilli sauce to zip it up another notch if spicy is to your liking. 

The restaurant is simple yet decor is clean and comfortable. The husband and wife team do also special Taiwanese cookies which we got to sample the pineapple filled ones which were a pleasant finish to a big bowl of soup. 

Service was friendly and we were the only ones in the restaurant on the visit so we had more personal explanations of their culture with some jokes thrown in.

The gnocci, the carbonara, the soup.  You cannot make an error ordering from their carefully chosen menu items.  But you might be amazed that freshness tastes much different than what you have become used to at the many chain Italian restaurants you somehow keep patronizing.

Most of my family lives on the West Coast where the frozen yogurt craze started.  There's a system that is exactly the same at each yogurt store and no one differentiates from it.  Because it works.  Customers get their cup, pick their yogurt, scoop on their own toppings and pay per weight.  Usually you can get a decent sized cup with more than enough toppings for about 3-4 bucks.  
I don't think I've walked out of Spoon Me spending less than 5 bucks after all was said and done.  Unless I want a small yogurt with no toppings.  Everything is ala carte.  Toppings..extra.  Fresh fruit...even more.

OK that was our bad,  we told them that they couldn't do that and they stopped. We ordered another round of shrimp and the manager decided to come over to our table and instead of politely notifying us that there is no sharing, it seemed like she wanted to announce it to the other tables around us and remind us that it says that on the menu. We offered to pay for a side of shrimp if it was an issue,  but the manager just said it was OK and walked away... The conversation between the manager and the elderly man after that was not professional and was indicative of someone who did not have enough training to diffuse a guest situation. 

Side note: if you and any other party members order their all you can eat shrimp option you still can't share. I made sure to clearly ask the server this question to be sure there was no misunderstanding. 

This rating is not because of the ""no sharing"" rule, I now take issue with the Outback Steakhouse slogan. The food was decent, but the situation should have been handled better. I have had ample customer and guest service training to know that much. I believe more training is necessary for both management and staff.

BUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.

I've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  

As a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.

My last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.

The visit in November is likely my last.  I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious.   There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon.  I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.

As another reviewer said- be forewarned.  You run a great risk of being disappointed.",2011-02-13 22:12:41

Being an ASU alum, I frequented the Tempe location, and it was one of the most unique and fun bars near campus. The atmosphere in Scottsdale is similar, despite being in one of the north side's more complicated and ginormous strip centers. They've clearly taken a design tip from the Tempe spot, with brick walls, similar lighting and bar and a decent-sized patio out front (not nearly the size of Tempe's, but oh well).

The evening started out well enough - we didn't realize we'd need a reservation but was able to sit at one of the high tops near the bar.  The table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.

We started out with the cheddar bites.  They were mini, dense and rather not great.  Its almost like a failure attempt at recreating Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits.  The shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from NOLA.  The meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  The duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  Too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.

The reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  These were the kinds of dishes that you might see on Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen.  But they wouldn't be winners by any means.  

The place is kept COLD.  We were near the vents, but still, by the time our food reached our table, they were lukewarm at best.

Diana's is Diana's - they have really good seafood. Now what they do with their seafood is sort of a hit or miss.

Overall, it's meant to be a greek restaurant style, but it's more so greek food for the Asian demographic. 

Overall, my general impression is that the chef doesn't quite get the delicacy of the seafood is working with yet cooks it to perfection. The scallops in pesto - over powering and the oil tastes stale. The octopus - grilled perfectly but the tabuleh and humus and pomegranate - too much and not well done. The tuna - served on seaweed salad....doesn't fit on the same plate as pickerel with sweet mash....very confusing and very strong flavours.

But what they do right are the classics. Great deal on Oysters - though i found the shucking to be a little poor - but when you're paying essentially $1.50 a shuck, you accept that.  The lavraki however - now this is the star of their menu. It's exceptional. No confusion - classic greek prepartion - the gril, some salt, some lemon and olive oil. The protein sings and the grill accents. 

My honest recommendation - just go for some oysters and lavraki and you'll have an excellent night. The rest is just confusing fluff.",2014-07-13 16:52:35

For our cocktail hour, I chose Metcalfe's to provide some appetizer trays as they were on my venue's preferred caterer list and I had experience of their quality product. It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.

Come the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call ""Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery."" ""Yes,"" I say. ""I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff."" ""But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,"" says Metcalfe's dude. ""I'm not there! I've just gotten married. I'm having my pictures taken. Please just go knock on the front door. There are a bunch of people who can help you."" ""Yeah, I went to the front door, but it says {the venue} is closed for a private event."" *FACEPALM* Now I was annoyed. ""YES! And YOU ARE BRINGING THE APPETIZERS!"" I then just snapped a bit and told him to sort it out and that I wasn't to be bothered.

Later (perhaps 20-30 minutes later) we parked our car at the venue for more photo taking and the delivery van from Metcalfe's was just leaving. I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well. Clearly the dude was not a people person and very confused about how to deliver to an event (as opposed to a person's house, etc.).

The food was good, but didn't have labels as to what it was. I'd asked about this and was told it would have. So our very expensive platter of Wisconsin artisanal cheeses and dried fruits and such didn't get eaten as much as it might have. That thing was *not* inexpensive. I was a bit miffed.

We came here for dinner last night and sat at the patio to watch the game. Honestly I feel like The Vig has one of the best nachos ever. Everything in their nachos is quality - we always like to add shredded chicken. For dinner, I ordered their famous mac and cheese with short ribs. Everyone at the table had a bite of my dish because it was incredible. It wasn't overwhelmingly tasty like other mac and cheese dishes. The pasta was cooked perfectly and served in an iron  skillet. You can order their burgers or sandwiches and upgrade your side to a mac and cheese or pozole for just $3. So worth it! My boyfriend always orders the pozole. I am not a fan of pozole in general but The Vig makes it so well. 

For drinks, our server misunderstood my order and gave me a Four peaks peach ale instead of the AZ peach shandy. She took the drink off our bill when she realized her mistake but I actually liked the four peaks peach ale more so than what I ordered.

i ordered the fish ""banh mi"" and... it was so freakin' good. whilst i do wish it was in a more traditional banh mi style bread (baguette vs round bun), it had the perfect amount of heat and i totally dug the interpretation. and the kale salad? o.m.gooooooodness. i know the mac and cheese is good and all... but you HAVE to get the kale salad. it is green perfection. and so good for your eyes!

the husband had the burger which was.... uhm, possibly the best burger i've had in arizona??? yeah. it was like that. juicy and perfectly cooked. with a side of church potatoes - what what???? that was like the ultimate comfort food meal right there. ULTIMATE. it was delectable. 

bro got the porkwich... that much pig on a piece of bread honestly scares me... but it really truly worked. and i understood why people are fanatical about it. his side of mac and cheese? now THAT, my friends is a good m&c. it was cheeeeeeeeesy up the heezy, and no weird liquidy sauce, the pasta shape didn't put me off. i wanted to swim in that mac and cheese. ok, maybe not because that was a hottttt little dish, but... i really really really really loved it. and wanted to steal it and eat it all. now that i'm revisiting that experience, i dunno how i feel about that kale salad. i'm torn. i choose both.

my dad had the reuben, which to me is a man-which. it was decent, just not my flava. 
my mom had either the brown bag chicken or the grilled chicken. i don't remember because my bro's gf had the other one. they were both good and i am not a big chicken sandwich fan. perhaps not phenomenal, but i would venture to say i might at some point be persuaded to order a chicken sandwich from here. 

we had the deviled egg dip... the chips were good, but the dip was kinda forgettable. 
service was amazing, the ambiance and decor... impeccable.

I was very impressed with the variety, especially the seafood: 3 different types of crab, scallops, clams, mussels, and even lobster. Not sure if the seafood variety is like this every night or I just happened to visit on a special day. A selection of noodles, vegetables, and meats (beef, chicken, pork, and lamb) rounded out my choices. Each of the refrigerated items were portioned out on Styrofoam plates and wrapped in cellophane, which I thought was a little wasteful. In the center of the restaurant were a bunch of desserts and some cooked items such as fried rice, pad thai, etc. The theme of the non-refrigerated items was thai. As mentioned by others, there was also a condiment/sauce section.

Both broths were fine. The spicy broth was not that spicy and did not cause any numbness, but nor was it very oily. The meats were just okay, very lean, so they ended up a little tough after cooking. The lamb (a classic) and beef (eye of round?) were my favorites. I am not a huge crustacean fan, especially if I have to shell them myself, but I did enjoy the shellfish. The desserts were okay, nothing special. The meats could have used a little more marbling and an extra waitperson would have helpful.",2014-11-30 00:00:05

Actually, my goal in life is to find the perfect AYCE place. This might be it...

First of all - the sashimi pieces are the size of a small child. I can honestly say I ate a whole salmon and a whole tuna to ma face. They also have talapia sashimi and talapia tempura - YUMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THE GALBI DOESN'T STOP FLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the staff is so nice - I ask for 40 pieces?? Sure! Anything I want - I AM THE KING OF THE SUSHI WORLD!!!!!!!!!

They have mussels - garlic butter and wasabi mussels, which is hard to find in a lot of AYCE places.

They have coconut shrimp - MASSIVE coconut shrimp. It's deep fried to golden perfection and not overly battered. 

Their maki have ONE layer of rice. Max 2. So little rice that I can see the seaweed through it. The pieces are exploding with fish. AMAZING!!!

Spider rolls and Kaze roll are my favorite. I think the Kaze roll is the one with 3 fish in it (salmon, white tuna and red tuna? maybe talapia) - ask them when you get there, some of the rolls have weird names but they are deliciousoooo.


I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE! ANYONE AND EVERYONE! PLEASE GO - don't listen to overly critical reviews. People have unreasonably high expectations for AYCE sushi. Kaze is quality and quantity and FREE POP. And it's relatively cheap - 20.99 for weekday dinner and 22.99 for weekend.",2013-01-02 15:21:21

Specialty: German-style Sausage Hall
Menu items: Bison, Wild Boar and Venison Sausages with Duck Fat Fries

Who is in for a sausage party? Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.
Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read ""Verst"". And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.

Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.

Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and SautÃ©ed JalapeÃ±os. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.

Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. 
But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.

Until next time Foodies!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana.",2011-09-25 23:16:05

Whoa...""Uh, yeah, how long is the wait?"" pause...HUGE eyeroll...""Like, an hour. Hour and a half. Hard to say."" Having just driven over two hours from Pittsburgh and being met with this wonderful attitude, we immediately peaced out of Melt. I looked down the street and pointed. ""DEAGAN'S!"" And sorry, I have a hard time believing that even Melt's super-hyped grilled cheese sandwiches could have lived up to our perfect lunch at Deagan's. Sometimes things really do happen for a reason, right?

I really wanted the barbecue pork, but I also really wanted the pork belly brussels sprouts, and I knew I couldn't possibly devour both at lunchtime. Our waitress insisted that I absolutely NEEDED to try both, and took it upon herself to ask the kitchen to make me the barbecue pork appetizer from the dinner menu instead of the entree from the lunch menu. I've never actually liked brussels sprouts that much (it was the promise of pork belly that lured me in, of course) but these were seriously good. I guess I've just never had them cooked right--super tender and drenched in butter. Least healthy vegetable ever, but also maybe the most delicious. The barbecue pork on a jalepeÃ±o pancake was awesome too, but the brusselsprouts were lifechanging.

Oh, and the beer selection here is interesting and varied, just like the menu. Our waitress enthusiastically brought us samples of anything we even pointed at on the menu before we could attempt to refuse them. I kind of wish it wasn't 2 in the afternoon so I could have had more than one...haha.

Various coupons/discounts are available for sauce which we used on both visits. Groupon $18 for $30 was used on the first visit and Yelp deal $50 voucher for $25, which was found on the Yelp app, was used on the second visit.

On our first lunchtime visit, we were sat in the bar area and I took the recommendations of our server Bernadette. For the appetizer, we had the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese. For entrees, my wife had the California panini and I had the Italian chimichanga. The common thread with our appetizer and my entree was the mix of pesto cream sauce and the tomato based marinara and arrabbiata sauces. I didn't think that was a good pairing. I might have the fried cheese again but without the pesto cream sauce. I wouldn't get the chimichanga again. There's too many ingredients (meatballs, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, mozzarella, and feta along with the arrabbiata and creamy pesto sauces) that just didn't meld well together.

On our second visit, we were seated on a Saturday night with one other table in the dining room. We ordered the kids fettuccine alfredo, the sauce sea bass (they were out of sea bass and salmon was substituted), and the create your pasta consisting of fettuccine, signature red sauce, meatball, roasted garlic, and mushrooms. If you're a garlic fan and not looking for any kind of make out session after dinner, order roasted garlic with your pasta. There were a total of about ten cloves of garlic in my pasta. For dessert, we had the zeppoli which was probably the best dish of the meal. Even with the lack of business, service was still slow. Everything was OK with this visit with nothing being bad, but nothing being that memorable.

The menu is large with a mix of traditional dishes and different creations so it's highly probable to find something of your liking. We just didn't score with either of our visits. I'd come back here if we had a discount or deal as we did with our previous visits and maybe we might find the dish that is right for us.",2015-10-08 06:25:15

They have a tour once a month. It's pretty much walk in and stand in one spot because its a very small spot.

The beers aren't anything special and that might be because they constantly change their recipes. Their one-offs tend to be their best bets but consistency in making them again is apparently tough for the brewery. (Hence ""one-off"")

This place has been out for a while. The place is designed to look modern, but the place is overall dim, so you can't really notice anything negative or positive. Overall look is average.

Service here was impeccable. Even with a full house and people constantly coming in and out of the restaurant, I felt my table had 2-3 dedicated waiters at our beck and call. However, not everyone there speaks chinese though. Regardless, our plates were changed, soups were served into bowls, teas refilled, and fast paced service. The food just kept non-stop. Definitely top notch service for a chinese cuisine place, and a chain at that. 

My table ordered the 8 person combo, at $238 with green onion rolled pancake with sliced pork, 2 extra orders of Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, and Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Dried Scallops, Pork & Luffa. The combo included, 5 variety cold dish, fish maw soup, peking duck with lettuce wrap upgrade, broccoli and eggs, leg of a pig, seafood veggie mix, steamed fish, mushroom greens, and lobster e-fu noodles.

Let's start off with the extra sides. The steamed dumplings are definitely good. Not as good as Xiao Long Bao that opened up just down on huntingwood, but still better than most places. The green onion pancake with sliced pork is definitely top notch. I find most places skimp on the green onion, the sauce, or/either the amount of pork. This place got it just right!! I was honestly expecting subpar food since this place was a chain, but a lot of the items were above expectations. The ones that shone the most were definitely the 5 variety cold dish taking first, broccoli and eggs taking second, and peking duck takes the third.

The cold dish honestly surprised me, it is usually too cold, making it lack flavour or too hard/chewy to have good texture. This one was bursting with flavour, moist and appetizing. The eggs within the broccoli is usually tame, but this one made my eyes go O_O, ""what is this?"" I typically don't care for this dish, but this was unique. It was strong, but not too salty and it didn't require any vinegar at all. Peking duck taste third, since there was ample meat in each slice, and the mix with the lettuce was crispy and refreshing!

All pictures attached, and definitely recommend people come try, as this chain restaurant is better than some traditionally opened chinese restaurants!",2015-10-17 04:59:49

We were brought rolls and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered several starters to share.  First was a half chorizo that was cooked with red wine and flame grilled tableside.

Next, we had the dish Halloumi, goat cheese grilled over cypress and served with a sweet and sour sauce. 

Next came the snails cooked with a chardonnay white wine and garlic sauce and broiled with mixed cheeses and served with some toast slices.

Next was Bacalao, a dish made up of salted cod, mashed potatoes, garlic, onions, eggs and extra virgin olive oil and served with a salad of mixed greens.  Lubka (Luby) told us how they treated the salt cod daily with whole milk to remove the saltiness of the cod so it wasn't overpoweringly salty.

Then onto the chicken Trinchado.  The chicken is marinated in red wine and grilled.  It's then put in the Trinchado sauce which had a nice paprika flavor and a small hint of cumin.

Then we had the Calamari curry, a bowl of nicely cooked calamari in a curry sauce that didn't hit you up front but had a nice curry tang after the fact.  It was quite good.  With the calamari, we got rice and a container of chutney.  The flavors complimented each other nicely.

When we thought we had no more room, Luby insisted we have some dessert.  We went with the tiramisu.  It's quite a different looking dish from common tiramisu.  The  ladyfingers weren't like most tiramisu but there was a wonderful chocolate and 
coffee flavor in the ladyfingers and the mascarpone cheese made this a wonderful ending dish.

Service was outstanding for the two hours or so that we were there.  We asked that the dishes not be brought out all at once and they did one at a time.  Luby came to the table and asked if it was OK to start the next dish.  She explained the dishes when she brought them and she was an absolute joy!  She's very proud of her food and she has reason to be proud!  

This was a very memorable lunch with good company, good conversation, excellent food, and outstanding and very pleasant service.  Thanks to LJ and Niyen for the heads up on Vila Algarve.

It's not that the wings were bad -- it's just that the hype of ""the best in the city"" means they have a lot to live up to.  Couple that with their own hype machine of  ""our medium is VERY HOT"", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.

What I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I'm not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I'm left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:

I call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their ""Hot"" was, I would have instead ordered ""Superhot"" or ""Death"".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.   

I've been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their ""hot""... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn't even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.

Listen, I get it, marketing is king... but c'mon.  At least try to back it up!  

I'm a bit sad to do it, but Duff's clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.  Not only have I experienced better, I've also experienced hotter.

I chose the chicken with fries and a salad while hubs got the pork kabob (forget the official name) with rice and a salad. We watched as the cook cut the potatoes and cook my fries on the spot! Delic! My only criticism is that they were is desperate need of salt. The salad was huge with large chunks of cucumbers, tomatoes, olives and feta.

My two favorites are the Meatloaf Sandwich  and the Little Italy. The meatloaf sandwich is a meal in itself piled with meatloaf, bacon, bbq sauce and mashed potatoes - it makes me hungry just thinking about it! The Little Italy is Italian bread, prosciutto, fig spread, fresh buffalo mozzarella, and field greens. 

They have a several homemade soups on the menu (tomato bisque, shrimp and corn chowder, minnestrone) but also have two daily soups that range from anything from cream of mushroom to Guinness stew.

The thinly sliced meat, covered in a nice mixture of egg batter with a bit of sweets and then cooked to tenderness.  The meat jun did not disappoint, but I can't say the same for the rest of our meal.  I'm still on the fence about their dipping sauce too.

The soon tofu, came out bubbling hot, but it was not in abundance of tofu and the soup was more runny because of lack of ingredients in this dish.  The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  

The bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  

The seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  

The worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.  You can see the marinade, but it was like it was sitting there all day and just lacked the water that vegetables are suppose to have.  

Service can be better, but the lady has all tables to herself.  I guess someone called in sick today?  It's a fairly cheap meal for Korean food.

The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.

We decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.

The food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.

Our bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.

Overall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.

A burger choice that is normally very messy to eat with guac and meat juices and such running all over the place was sorta dry. And even picking the burger up in my hands it felt cool.  The side salad was OK.

The Winterlicious menu was only $25.00 and I would say you definitely get your dollars worth. 

As a starter I had the Salad Midi which was nice and light way start to my meal. It was made with mixed greens, prosciutto, asiago cheese, dried berries & pesto drizzle.  But of course, I had to steal from others plates as well. The Crostini was superb as well! For the main, I decided to go with the Fettuccini with Black Tiger Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, Mussels, Roasted Red Peppers, Baby Spinach in a Rose Sauce. I was slightly disappointed with the main. I wish they had made the salmon and red peppers into bigger pieces instead of blending it into the sauce. The Black Tiger Shrimp was amazing and fresh though. For dessert I had the Profiteroles which is Choux Pastry with Vanilla ice Cream & Hot Chocolate Sauce. It was my first time trying Profiteroles and I have to say I didn't enjoy them as much as I would have liked to. The Choux Pastry tasted somewhat like soggy pancakes because the ice cream was melting and the Hot Chocolate Sauce tasted like store bought chocolate sauce. There was nothing special about it.

Damn Holler & Dash, I tell you what, there's some magic going on behind that counter. I guess I should elaborate!

Around here is where I'd typically insert the obvious hollaback one liner. I'll yield to the other reviews, you beat me to it! When you walk in, the warm, natural interior design makes you feel very welcome. Good use of several elements such as stone, timber, and an exposed ceiling give the whole dining area a spacious atmosphere.

Speaking of rush, if you want a calm visit then make sure you stop by as early as possible (they open at 7am every morning). The place fills up very fast. Fortunately they have a TON of staff on hand to handle to the heavy hours.

My first visit I tried one of the signature biscuits: Chicken Set Go! There was a bit of a sticker shock on the price at $9, however once you get it, you'll see that this is no ordinary biscuit. First of all, it's HUGE. I mean the top half of the biscuit is larger than the whole of what you'd get at most places. This particular creation had moist, seasoned fried chicken topped with pimento cheese, pickled jalapeno, sorghum, and served with a side.

It's a winner! Wow, that chicken tho. The chicken was moist, and had the right concoction of spices. Perfectly breaded and fried right on the money. Just the right amount of crunch for a best-case biscuit. Pimento cheese provided a delicious creaminess and the pickled jalapenos the right amount of sour astringency to redline all of my tastebuds. Who knew a biscuit could be this complex, yet all come together to make the breakfast of your dreams? What I thought was overpriced at first all the sudden had a ton of value in size, taste, and presentation.

The cheese grits were very good. A lot of ""Southern Breakfast"" places around here give you a bowl of grits that look almost watered down, for me the thicker the better and here they do it right. Very well seasoned too, which is not always a gimme when it comes to grits. The kitchen staff has really proven themselves with my breakfast.

Its concept is nice: western cafe meals (eg. Pastas, casseroles, fries, etc.) with a Japanese twist. 

Even though I have a penchant for Japanese fusion cuisine, this cafe falls flat. When I first went here the servers were attentive and the food had a more memorable flavour. Now, the servers never swing by at all. Some may like this, but when one expects bottomless coffee to be refilled, this doesn't sit well. After receiving your food, don't expect servers to even look at you again (the two servers were too busy talking to each other near the cash register). I heard that there is a revolving door of workers here, so this may be why the staff seem less professional than I remember.  As such, be warned about the bill: I asked for split bills, but one waitress said that wouldn't be possible unless we paid in cash, whereas on my second attempt another waitress had split the bills for us without question.

Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. 

As far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.

My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. 

We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. 

Something tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.",2015-05-26 11:57:15

Wandering through this park after dark is eerie enough, but wading through it at 3am in the fog?  With all kinds of people dazedly roaming around staring at creepy art installations?  Priceless.

This park offers some rare downtown hill climbing, which is great if you want to add a little switch to your workout routine (or if you just like rolling down hills).  In the midst of fall foliage season or the first blooms of spring, heading down to Trinity Bellwoods for a little nature loving is practically a requisite pilgrimage.  And while it's a little less impressive than the more Westerly High Park, you are certainly going to feel a little sigh of green relief after an afternoon's frolick (preferably after brunch to work off the Hollandaise-related fog).  

This city can be so gray at times, especially if your neighborhood has more concrete than grass.  Stepping into the park for a few hours' stroll is a huge way to decompress.

I have a puppy that has a lot of energy and this park is pretty big, giving her lots of room to run around and, of course, get tired. I don't like to go too late in the day because there are just too many dogs and she gets distracted, but my late morning trips have always been a pleasure. 

My one dislike about the park is that part of it appears to be a retention basin. Water collects and stagnates in a particular area and they use PVC and plastic fencing to block it off. It doesn't do anything to keep the dogs out. They need to re-engineer where the water runs off or determine a better way to secure that disgusting pool of water.

The park does not have a section for timid or small dogs and one for large dogs. I've seen people bring toy sized dogs, 2-3lbs, and I was a little concerned the dogs would get trampled/ attacked. I caught my little 20lb Basenji mix stalking one of these tiny dogs, so I had to shift her attention.

At first I was a little worried about staying here mainly due to the commute (not the quality of the place as it was opened in 2005) but I was happily surprised.  

Check in was a breeze even though it was the Friday before NYE and everyone was coming into town.  Even though there was quite a long line the casino had all the counters manned and checking in and getting into the room took less than 20 minutes.  Moreover, during check in they also give you a coupon book for some free stuff or buy one get one free stuff which was kind of cool.  Only complaint was that when calling in to inquire about when you can check in took about 10 minutes on hold to get to speak with someone.

The room itself was very spacious and clean and comes with all the amenities that you would expect from a reputable Vegas hotel.  Our room consisted of a king size bed, flatscreen TV, table, and a sofa (along with the rest of the nightstand, drawers, and closet).  This room could easily stuff 6 or so people in it if you really wanted to.  Moreover, it was nice how their bathroom was divided into two, with a door between the shower/toilet and the sink, thus allowing two people to share the bathroom at a time.  Definitely no complaints about the spaciousness or cleaniness of the room here.

Moreover, while I did not get to try out their amenities during my stay this time, I think I will definitely be back next time to try out their midnight madness bowling.  Apparently, during the weekdays after midnight all games are only a dollar!  I mean can you imagine, forget beer pong, how about beer bowling or a shot for every pin left standing haha.  

As for the food of this place, again I did not get to try out much but their Steak N Shake seemed like a decent and moderately priced place to get a meal.  I actually ended up getting a togo order of 3 sliders and shake for about $11 bucks so that wasn't too bad.

As for the convenience of this location, well for off-strip, it is pretty convenient even during NYE.  Located right off the freeway, it is easy to get to and out of into the Strip.  It is about a 15 minute drive by freeway and about a 20 minute drive by Las Vegas Blvd (I like how you have two routes to this place) with either being traffic free by the times I was driving.  

As a note, if you are planning to come here for New Years park at the Mandalay Bay!  The Strip is closed until 3am but as Mandalay Bay is at the end of the Strip you can still get out and take either Las Vegas Blvd or the freeway back without much hassle.

Only complaint with this place is that their shuttle to and from the Strip (cheap at only $8 all you can ride for a day) only runs till 1:00am.  Who goes back to the hotel at 1:00am in Vegas...especially on New Years.  They should make it 24 hours or at least 24 hours on the holidays.",2012-01-03 18:43:58

a friend and i were actually looking for a different mexican restaurant, one she tried to go to on a sunday and monday, the only two days they are closed, and when we arrived on saturday evening, we found a sign saying they have moved from phoenix to mesa.  clearly not destined to patronize that restaurant.  

anyway, we'd passed the sign for this tiny strip mall restaurant and decided to head back and give an unknown place a try. the atmosphere is pretty generic, there are both booths and tables and some typical mexican decoration. doesn't transport me to a mexican pueblo, but it's not a tourist trap either so i was pretty comfortable.  after a quick scan of the menu my friend decided on the green chili burrito smothered with cheese and plated with beans and rice. ($6.75) i went for the chiles rellenos with rice and beans. ($9.25)

we ate some average tortilla chips with some super spicy red chili salsa and though our meals were out in record time we got a free refill of the chips when we drained the first bowl. 

my chiles rellenos were excellent.  dark green chiles lightly breaded, filled to the brim with white cheese and smothered in a spicy green sauce with some extra cheese on top. rice tasted like it had been cooked in beef broth and the beans were definitely cooked with a ham bone.  i'm a vegetarian so i had to skip those but there were two big chiles and i got hot fluffy corn tortillas so i didn't need the sides anyway.

Kate started to dig into her plated burrito when she realized that it was not a 'green chile burrito' but a pork burrito with green chile sauce.  she's not a vegetarian, and is literally the calmest and nicest person i've ever met, but she was pissed. she didn't send it back under the pretenses of false advertising, which she probably should have, but she was really annoyed and even as we were leaving she commented that she would never go back to a place that doesn't label their menu items correctly. 

so on the one hand i would go back there in a heartbeat, quick service, good food and for the most part decent prices, kate would list it on a top ten places to avoid list. i would say if you're on baseline and you want something that doesn't pander to gringo's head over to el mesquite and give it a try.",2007-05-20 23:24:21

We came on a Saturday night and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Don't know if this is the bad part of Parma or what, but other reviewers are right that nobody seems to come here. The whole place felt sort of like a run-down hole-in-the-wall mom and pop restaurant.  The experience was kind of surreal, actually.   We had a pho and a vietnamese noodle salad.  The noodle salad was pretty typical and tasted decent.  The pho broth was decent, not particularly flavorful, but the meat was overcooked and there was not enough of it.

But really, this place lives up to its hype. I've been here twice, and both times have just been extraordinary. Their taquito entrees are delicious, and their sides are to die for. For the taquitos, I had the remolacha. A bunch of different flavors and textures that will amaze you. Regarding the sides, the smoked gouda tamales and the sofrito green beans will leave you wondering what you've been eating your entire life. It's like an explosion of flavor enticing your taste buds. Yes, my mouth is currently watering.

Be warned-if you get the guacamole trio, like we did, be prepared to take the rest of your meal home. It's more than we bargained for, but oh so delicious. The goat cheese guac, pineapple guac, and blue cheese guac are all excellent. I've also tried the jalapeno bread pudding for dessert. Simply amazing. You get the flavor of jalapeno without all that heat, and it just makes for a very unique dish. 

If anything is the downfall, its the wait in general. Waits to get a table are long, but nothing going next door to Johnny Mango's for their super strong mojitos won't fix.

   ---   ---   ---

I've been flying into Hopkins since I was 2 years old. I waited all year long for our annual summer vacation to spend in Cleveland with family.

The problem with Hopkins is that it seems like it hasn't been updated a ton since 1986. Everything just kind of seems old and worn. 

And as an avid defender of Cleveland, I feel that the airport doesn't do the city any favors. Cleveland has always been the butt of any joke related to a city that just generally sucks and is totally undesirable. But Cle gets a raw deal here, as there's plenty of awesomeness in the 216 and the 440. 

So my please to the folks in charge of such things: update stuff! Make the airport not look like the mid 80's everywhere. Signage, decor, the flooring, etc. Let's join the modern era! I'd love to see the reactions of people dreading a business trip to Cleveland, who exit the plane, and say, ""wow... this is..... NICE!""

I'd have to disagree.... but it's not bad like some of the other places in Vegas.

Pros: 
-Menu options are great, especially on the back where you can get large combo platters if you and a friend want to share a variety. 
-Menu is pretty clear and easy to understand. 
-Lobster claw game at $2 a play is entertaining at best but difficult to grab, lobsters are usually clumped together in the corner
-Sauce is not oily like the competition which kept my stomach ache free

Cons:
-There was a manager lady who wasn't friendly at all. I was seated by a gentlemen but the lady came by to drop off the menus without a single kind gesture, and didn't even ask if I wanted anything to drink while I wait for my friends.
-The sauce is less oil but lacks heavily in flavor. The hot n juicy special is loaded with spices and garlic to give you a delicious kick. The sauce here was spicy but bland
-All the seafood is market price and listed on a tiny neon menu in the center of the restaurant. Maybe putting more around the restaurant so people don't have to get up to see it
-Shrimp is puny.....  (no pun intended)

The beers were good and while I am glad I got a sampler. Their lineup at the time reminded me a bit of Wicked Weed in Asheville, just not quite up to that quality and creativity.

They appear to very much be attempting to be a place that views food as art, although I am not entirely confident that NoDa is the best place to be so esoteric. The ""faux"" bq tacos missed the mark; I believe they were attempting something along the lines of a miniature puffy taco you can get in San Antonio and elsewhere around Texas, but it came off as dry and bland.

That being said the smoked wings were GREAT! Just the right amount of spice and with four big full wings (still joined flat and drum, so really eight wings) for $9, I was a happy camper.

The breakfast burrito with carne asada was piping hot, the cheese was properly melted and the potatoes stayed warm down to the last bite. I'd say solid work on everything everything except the carne asada. A few too many pieces of meat were either too chewy or too fatty. Both salsas were fantastic. Red: smoky, balanced chipotle peppers, plenty of heat; Green: much more subtle in heat and flavor, but still worth putting a few splashes of it on parts of your burrito. I only wish they kept the salsas on ice, but having individual bottles to take to your table is also nice. At $4-4.50 for just eggs+potatoes and $6.50ish for eggs+steak, I think the portion size is just a hair too small. Don't get me wrong, it tastes fantastic and it was definitely filling, but other places don't mess around with portions.

I think the only downfall of this place was the prices. $10 for a breakfast burrito is a little crazy. Especially when there was nothing special about it just bacon, potatoes, and eggs with some hot sauce on the side. Don't get me wrong, it was good but not at that price.

I had two free passes for the Cineplex theatre so I thought I'd use them towards admission to the VIP theatre in Brossard.  The entrance is separate from the main theatre and it's 18+ since they serve alcohol here.

You enter and you're in the lounge area which is complete with a bar.  They do have a small concession stand selling classic movie snacks (popcorn, candy, etc) but if you're dishing out for the VIP experience treat yourself and order from the bar.  They have a variety of appetizers and food like burgers so you could eat a full meal.  My boyfriend and I were there a little bit early so we ordered nachos and raspberry mojitos to enjoy in the lounge area.  The SCENE card gets you 10% off the food but not alcohol.  The other awesome thing about this place is the bathrooms.  They're all individual bathrooms and they're super clean. 

Seating inside the theatre is very comfortable and there are servers there to get orders and bring them to you up until the movie starts.  One thing I love about the VIP theatre is that they don't seem to show ads prior to the trailers and actual film.  That is always my biggest pet peeve about going to the movies.

Admission is quite pricey at $18.75 a person so you can be sure I won't be coming to the VIP theatre every time I go to the movies.  I would definitely do it though on the occasional night where I feel like treating myself.",2014-10-27 14:43:44

The quality of the sushi, while not the best in town, is always solid and doesn't kill your wallet.

I've yet to ever discover the hidden treasure, but I keep on trying. 

Along with the $1 menu, the lunch buffet seems to be the draw for most people.  I've only tried the buffet here once and doubt that I'll rush back again.  The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.  What is wrong with people?  I imagined them texting the friend right behind them since nobody actually has real conversation any more.  And then when these chronic texters take the last of the tuna tartare?!?  Seriously? If you can't navigate a buffet line like a pro, you don't deserve the tuna tartare.  So let it be written, so let it be done.

1. This is a nail school in a not so great part of town;
2. Because it is a school, the quality and consistency of the services is unreliable;
3. Don't buy the Groupon. Call the salon first, tell them you would like an appointment, and when they ask about Groupon, tell them you were going to buy one. This will ensure you get an appointment right away, as they can only do so many Groupons per day, and they will honor the Groupon price regardless;
4. The manicurists/students are all incredibly sweet and friendly;
5. This is a no frills, no massage chair salon (which I prefer as those massage chairs are filled with nasty, gross tubes filled with other peoples nail gunk that can never be cleaned out, ew).
6. Make sure you have time to burn, my mani/pedi took over two hours!
I decided to visit this salon because Groupon sent me an email advertising their Groupon. I was interested in the gel manicure and spa pedicure for $25, as it sounded like a very good deal. I called the salon before purchasing the Groupon to check their availability. The asked right away if I was calling with a Groupon, and whether or not I had purchased one yet. I indicated that I had not, and they said that was excellent, as they can only take so many Groupon customers per day, but that they would offer the Groupon price anyways if I just came in.
This salon is located in a not so fabulous part of town, but I would hardly classify it as ghetto. If this side of town is ghetto to you, you clearly have never been to a real ghetto before. The customer service that I experienced here was on par with any other salon. They were friendly when they greeted me, offered coffee or water, and were all smiles. The women who did my manicure and pedicure were both incredibly sweet, and their customer service was phenomenal. 
However, this IS A SCHOOL. As such, the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable. I had to wash and scrub my own nails, and my manicure left much to be desired. The gel is inconsistent, wrinkled, does not cover my whole nail, and the tips were left exposed. It is simply awful. I was very disappointed with my manicure. My pedicure, however, turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin. So it's really just a fluke whether or not your service will be good I suppose.
Since this is a school, the students work very slowly as they learn, so make sure you have time to burn. The whole mani/pedi experience lasted over two hours, and I had two women working on me at the same time. 
I decided to try this Groupon because of the neat pics of nail art other Yelpers had posted, but that was a mistake. Do not come here looking for anything other than solid color gel manicures, this is not the place. 
Overall, even though this place is a good deal, remember what your parents always said, ""if the deal is too good to be true, it probably is."" The stars I gave are for the students who, as I said, are incredibly sweet and well intentioned, but that a manicurist does not make. I would not recommend this salon, nor will I be returning.",2014-12-17 23:04:18

They have hot stone massage, aromatherapy and some other offerings as well. What I signed up for was a monthly payment package that actually makes getting massages a great deal AND keeps you there at least once per month which is exactly what I need.

After some clumsiness at finding which service rep would check me in, I met Don Pagel, who is the foundation of the repair department. 
I needed some repairs done on my Silverado diesel, and gave Don a comprehensive list. He called the next morning with the list broken down bit by bit. 

When I explained I'd hoped to have the truck back in 3 days, he expressed that while he could probably do it, it wouldn't be as thorough as he'd like and would I accept the offer of a rental car at their expense, so they could do a thorough and clean job. 

They gave me a rental car, Eli was terrific to deal with. 

Throughout the next four days, Don emailed me each day with progress, and overall sharing that they were on-schedule. This guy is a complete pro from start to finish.

On pickup, he made the rental return as easy as ""didja scratch it?"", a quick walkaround, check of the fuel, and gave me the keys to my truck. 

My truck had been washed (I kinda wish they'd detailed the interior, it was quite dirty but also disorganized and I can't blame them for attacking this mess). 

Then, Don followed up with an email, and this morning followed up with a phone call. My experience at this Findlay property was in such contrast to my experience with their RV lot, I simply needed to share.

You can read about my RV experience at: https://www.yelp.com/biz/findlay-rv-las-vegas?hrid=8BMTgU2mXlFOEhle3rMxKA

Especially since I had gotten pregnant and had experienced a few weeks worth of morning (all day long) sickness.  Well this past Friday, she finally twisted my arm enough into going.  

I've had Pho at a lot of different restaurants.  I've had Pho so much so, that I got burnt out on it a few years back.  Hence, my reason for not really wanting to check this place out.  You've had one Pho, you've had'em all.  

We both ordered the Pho ga ca rau xanh (Pho chicken, broccoli, and baby bok-choy)

The noodles were about par for pho noodles.  The broth was as standard as any pho broth.  There was hardly any broccoli and baby bok.  You're paying .75 extra for broccoli and bok, so I expect to see quite a bit in my pho.  Also, they only brought out 1 small plate (about the side of a bread plate) for the two of us to split of the bean sprouts, lime, chili pepper, and thai basil.    You'd think if both of us are ordering pho, we'd BOTH get a plate.  I will say though, the bowl was huge.  After having a few spoonfuls of the broth and bites of noodles, I ended up just eating the broccoli, bok, and most of the chicken.

We split an order of the spicy pork vietnamese springrolls.   Now, those were awesome!  The rolls were nice and stuffed.  The dipping sauce that they come with, spicy and slightly sweet.  Throw some chili paste on them and they're perfect!  If I had known that the pho would have been such a disappointment to me, I would have ordered the springrolls as my entree.

Price: the food was really overpriced, everything was about 5$ too expensive.
The menu: The menu has a very small selection and not much variance. It seemed like they had a few things on the menu that stuck out.
The ambiance: Seems really ""date-nightish"". Dim warm yellow pendant lantern lights and candle light. The booths where long and spacious, so you have lots of room, but also high, so you feel like your in your own little spot, not being crowded.
The taste: The all important taste test. I am a burger guy for sure, so I ordered the Black Label Burger. The composition was ok... They put the vegetables on the side, so the cheddar cheese sticks to the bun which makes it hard to pull apart. I think the burger may have under-seasoned because it had little flavor other than the bacon and unseasoned beef. They also don't pat the bacon dry before putting it in the burger, and the burger was really juicy, which is a good thing, but it ended up being very greasy and soggy by the end.

Out of the 3 KBBQs I've been to in Las Vegas, this is the only AYCE where the servers actually come around and cook your meat for you which is convenient. They have a decent grade of meat and there's a variety to order from. 

The banchans are nicely seasoned and they usually bring out Jun (korean pancake) and some cheesy corn (which I still don't understand why you would eat Korean food with cheesy corn) to place on the grill. They also bring you plenty of kimchi and kong-namul (bean sprouts) which they'll grill for you to enjoy with the meat.

At the end of your meal definitely ask for the fried rice (I think it's a little extra). They'll add rice, eggs, veggies, and whip you up some kimchi fried rice with whatever meat you still have grilling. Yum!

As this was the first AYCE KBBQ I discovered in Las Vegas, I would come here until I discovered Tofu Hut. Honey Pig is a bit pricier (over $25 I believe for dinner) where Tofu Hut is $17 and also comes with my favorite steamed egg and bean paste soup.

And here is the reason why... We recently moved to Mountain's Edge and were in search of a new groomer for our 2 dogs (Dachshund terrier and Poodle mix). We saw the reviews for this place were good so decided to give it a try. They called us back in the expected time frame (about 5 hours). The dogs seemed fine and groomed. They did miss a couple of areas for our Dachshund (they missed his left ear and chest), but we didn't have any major complaints so we decided to take them again a few months later. The next time we went, it was my sister who paid and picked-up the dogs. When she was paying the tip for the groomer, the check-out girl saw the amount of tip and gave my sister a nasty look and asked if that was all the tip she was giving the groomer. My sister thought $30 for 2 small dogs for a simple hair and nail trims were enough (I have to mention that they are both well behaved dogs, and we have never had any complaints or problems with groomers, vets or people) And even if the tip wasn't enough, the girl should have not given her a dirty look and judged her. Ever since then, my sister refuses to take our dogs and her own dog to Barking Dogs. Not only because she was personally offended, but because she was afraid that they were going to mistreat our dogs for what they considered a ""not enough"" tip. The total for the 2 dogs was $90. We tipped more than 30%.

I harbor no ill will towards Pac East, in fact, I like the sushi here a lot. I've just, well you know... had better. Not that we have a plethora of amazing sushi places to choose from in the CLE (hello, Lake Erie), but I do think we have some better choices. One is right up the street! 

Pacific East got voted ""Best in Cleveland"" a few years in a row or something. Cool. I mean, I definitely think the food is great. I've never had bad sushi or service. I've even had lots of take-out that was tasty when I got it home. 

Some things in particular that I like: 

1) Thank you Pacific East for your low prices. You make eating healthy, tasty sushi on a budget possible. Especially back when I literally had barely enough money to live. Yum.

2) Fast, friendly service. I know I can always hit up Pac East for a quick bite to eat before I have to go do something else. 

3) Good quality food that is consistent. Nothing is worse than varying dishes that you love the first time around, but the second just sucked. 

The only downside I can see about Pacific East is really just the parking situation on Coventry. There's limited street space, I never have change for the dang meters in the garage, and the Cleveland Heights police department loves to write parking tickets.

It started off great with us being seated fast and our waitress being at the table helping us with the menu and explaining specials. I ordered the carne asada plate and the rest of our table ordered.

A couple other people came after and it seemed that her service went to the other 2 tables as they got their food before us even after being seated well after us and they had their bill paid and left well before we could even get her attention for the bill. After getting the bill we had to sit around even more waiting for her to get it and return our card. This is the loss of the 2 stars as poor service can ruin an experience

The food was pretty good though. My carne asada was very moist and very flavorful. I was able to make a burrito with it as they serviced it with chorizo beans, rice, and guacamole and sour cream and a tortilla. They also served some potatoes with it but they were meh at the best. Still had extra carne asada which was very nice as I was able to eat it alone and it was good. The chips and salsa was good and they had this tomatillo salsa that was great

Didn't look like much but me being the way I am insisted on trying it. Apparently it's everything I ever dreamed of: asian buffet (good quality food as opposed to the crap you find on most asian buffets), and ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!

When I found out about the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI I kinda felt unnerved at the idea, presuming it would most likely be pretty gross. Man was I ever proved wrong. I have eaten in a lot of Toronto's sushi joints and this place definitely has some of the best sushi in town.

As for the environment it is very clean. Washrooms are beautiful. Servers are all very nice when you can get their attention. Though they have gotten better. When we first started going in we were some of their first customers so we got astounding service. When the pace started to pick-up though we noticed the quality of service diminish. But they have made some good improvements. They're a new business so I'll give them a break this time I guess.

If there were any quirks about the place I'd have to point out it would be their hilarious selection of music. Some nights you will go in and it will be good ol asian music straight through. But other times we have been in there you get the classic asian music mixed with unbelievably random songs ranging from forgot about dre (Dr. Dre and Slim Shady) to what I think was a bootlegged Iron Maiden song. 

All in all one of my favourite spots in the city if your looking for a good meal for an awesome price.

Speaking of price, lunch is from 1100-1600 and costs $10 for the buffet. After 1600 its $14. On weekend add $2 to both of those prices.

Also, Oishi Sushi was just recently licensed to serve liquor and their beer is dirt cheap at less than $4 a bottle (domestic)!!!

They even have a ""jukebox to choose music from.  The staff was pleasant & very helpful & even picked out the perfect ball for me before I even asked (they are behind the counter).

I didn't feel they were trying to cheap out on their AYCE orders. Although we weren't given an option for a regular menu I would imagine you don't have to do AYCE if you don't want too.

1/5 for the staff/office
4/5 for Dr. Rebecca Tyre....I figure doc should carry more weight than staff...

Why 1/5 for the staff/office?
1. Staff is very unfriendly. REALLY unfriendly. I read some poor reviews before going in and I thought, well, I'll kill them with kindness. Entirely unsuccessful. Front desk staff pretty much avoided any sort of eye contact, and will flat out refuse to talk to you until they call you up...in fact, I had to go up three times over 1.5 hrs to find out they were having issues with my insurance. 

2. The wait is INSANE. I had a 9AM appointment. How does a 9AM appointment run over 1.5 hrs late?

3. Seriously, are they not allowed to smile?

There is minimal explanation of what happens. They also get very annoyed with you when you are unable to read their mind and herd  yourself to the correct cubicle to find the correct PA/nurse.

4/5 for Dr. Tyre.
The interaction with Dr. Tyre was surprisingly pleasant. She was friendly and comforting, which I feel is an important characteristic in an OB/GYN. The only reason I am taking 1 star off is because I was recommended a redo of a certain test in 6 mo to confirm something...which seemed completely reasonable...until my friends that are practicing OB/GYNs elsewhere told me that's really not the standard of care. I understand and definitely appreciate the sentiment to rule out certain things...but I'm also a firm believer in following standard of care and avoiding excessive testing.  

Overall, because the office was so terribly unpleasant, I doubt I will be returning.",2015-04-15 05:13:39

The food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That's probably why you get your food real quick!! It's already been prepared all they do is reheat it!

The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that I think I love China Way (see my other review) more and its more authentic I believe. Everytime I have been to Pei wei though, I have not be disapointed. I have several favs. The honey seared chicken is amazing, as are the Pei Wei spicy beef, lettuce wraps, and Dan Dan noodles. The orange beef , pad thai, and chicken lo mein are pretty good as well but I rarely order them because I love the other dishes more. I love that you can order noodles with your entrees in place of the rice but having the option of brown rice is nice as well when I am trying to watch what I eat. Another tip if you are watching calories: you can get any main dish with the chicken steamed instead of battered and fried. Pei Wei also makes the most amazing crab wontons with the best sauce evar!!! One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to crab wontons is when there is no crab. Hello, crab is in the name so it should be present in the dish! At Pei Wei, you can actually taste and see the crab in their wontons. Mix that with the sweet chili sauce they serve the wontons on and these are great! Don't get me wrong though, I've tried some of their other dishes that I was not a big fan of. Their thai coconut chicken was a little bland, the sweet and sour chicken is not what I look for in sweet and sour chicken (the sauce wasnt very strong), and the mongollian chicken had a strange flavor that I didnt care for. But to each his own, people have different taste. Anyways, Pei Wei is one of my favorite places to go and the prices are relatively cheap.

Same great steaks and seafood (according to Hubby) and same great service.  We only had one iffy time while it has been Anthony's and our server corrected the problem immediately and professionally.  To preface this, we NEVER send back food but our steaks were clearly overdone; my filet was ordered medium but came out well done while Hubby's bone-in ribeye was ordered medium rare but, came out medium-medium well.  Again, I can't stress how well our server handled the situation.

When we go out for steaks, we're pretty much creatures of habit, filet mignon, ribeye, or bone-in ribeye.  Steaks at Anthony's are top-notch and can rival any steakhouse on the Strip.  Steaks do come with complimentary sauces such as bearnaise, bordelaise, and peppercorn--try the bordelaise!!!!  Another thoughtful note Anthony's provides for their steak diners are the complimentary roasted tomato topped with parmesan and a petite mixed greens salad with a very light lemon viniagrette.  For those of you who like french onion soup, please note they must've changed their recipe when they transitioned from Terzetto's to Anthony's.  The french onion soup tastes like it has tomato sauce/paste in it now; it used to be a robust beef stock flavor.  Sides are very good here.  I highly recommend their creamed corn.  Tater tots should be ordered only if you are having a very light dinner, as they're very dense and heavy.

Again, service is A to A+ and can also rival some of the most elite steakhouses on the Strip.

The contemporary decor in Anthony's hasn't changed much since it was Terzetto's.  It's still a very large restaurant with tons of seating options.  It has the oyster bar adjacent to it and a regular drinking bar off to the side.

You know how you start writing the yelp review as soon as you enter the place? When I saw myself all thoughts left me except 'christ I look good.' 

It would be dismissive to give GwE 5 stars based only on their premise of Organic hair care and styling, but I might have done it anyway because I really truly believe that everyone needs to read the ingredient labels of all the products they use (hair, face, body) and really think about what dubious chemistry is seeping into their bodies every day. I will be a Green with Envy girl for the rest of my stay here in the Valley, not only because their business philosophy is ethical and whole-hearted but because they have excellent stylists. 

Today I saw Eric Flotta who was nice enough to take me as soon as he came in, even though I was half an hour early. And he didn't scream in horror at my post-workout hair, just led me over to the sink to start my wash/style/blowdry.  He told me about some of the organic products that the salon uses and carries for retail purchase and even mentioned that GwE uses the first and only hair color that doesn't include toxic chemicals. 

Eric didn't do any wild and crazy hair makeover on me, but my hair does look very sexy and different. I like that he could take my frightening mess and turn it into something simple and beautiful in not a lot of time and with minimal product in it.  He recommended a product to me and though I am a staunchly opposed to buying salon hair care I did because it's organic and makes me look nice!

I will say this don't order fried rice here they haven't mastered it yet and I think it's because they're not cooking it in a wok. It's very mushy and lacks flavor. The seafood though is fire and I love the packages they offer I think if they can work on these things like their side dishes they will be a force to be reckon with.

I've never seen a nail salon with such welcoming decor. It's usually the same office-like chairs and oversized, slightly uncomfortable massage chairs. The furniture here is contemporary but so comfortable and welcoming. I wanted to sink into those pedicure chairs but only had a manicure on my first visit. The salon is SPOTLESS. I was told that the pedicure tubs have their own disposable liners, which makes me feel so comfortable with how hygienic and clean this place is. 

Jenny did my manicure and she was fabulous. Very personable and so meticulous! I chose a pink glitter polish but expressed concerned that it wouldn't be dark enough with two coats. She initially tried and realized it wouldn't be, so she removed the polish and started over with a darker color for the first coat. I so appreciated how hard she worked to make my manicure perfect!  

My only complaints are that they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays (I've been meaning to come here for quite some time but, ironically, the only times I found myself available for pampering were on Mondays so I missed out for quite a few months... finally, when I was off on a Wednesday, I was able to make an appointment). I'd also like a separate drying area for my nails. I'm obsessive about making sure my nails are completely dry prior to leaving and I would literally sit for 40 minutes under the dryer if it meant they would be hardened and dry and I wouldn't ruin my lustrous new manicure!

2 Tea Eggs, 1 Large Taro Sago, Deep Fried Milk, Durian Pancake, and a 1 specialty drink.. $26.50 take-out price..


The Tea Eggs were really just so-so.. and over priced at $1.25 each plus tax.. tasted legit and flavourful.. but only the first one.. second one was a fail.. ??

Deep Fried Condensed Milk was ok.. didn't taste bad.. it was missing sweetness.. it was fried pretty nicely and crispy on the outside.. and came with some sugar on the side.. but definitely needs to be sweeter on its own..

Durian Pancake was oh oh K K.... not enough real durian.. but for the price.. it was acceptable..

More than a year after my last visit to their Church St. location, I was happy to thee that the North York menu was the same! We got to try all of our old favourites, and all were fresh, delicious, and plated wonderfully :)

My favourites: Kinoko (cheese and mushroom) bibimbap, Gindara (black miso cod), Ebimayo(fried shrimp doused in spicy mayo...drool), Takoyaki (octopus balls) & Okonomiyaki (japenese pancake).

The only item that fell a bit short was the seared tuna....the fish was a bit too cooked and the toppings a bit band.. but still edible. 

3 happy full people, 8 dishes, 3 drinks (lychee mojito! yum!) and 1 dessert later (delicious green tea cheesecake) the total per person came to $43 including taxes and tips.

Set-up is nice, and staff is super friendly, and just as loud and vibrant as the Church location.

Will be back!

It's hard to miss the restaurant from the street with the beautiful purple trees outside (also found inside).  We barged right in, shoved two long tables together and waited for all (8) family members to arrive.  The dining space is huge! It almost seemed like after all the dining patrons have gone home the staff could easy shove all the tables aside and turn it in to one huge after hours dance party. A better analogy would be to describe the inside of The Village as a cafeteria, is that better?

On to the menu. A one-sided card with menu items listed there didn't appear to be anything over $10.00 on the entire menu; now you're speaking my language!  The hummus was eh, the pita bread was decent, and chicken kabob was ok.  Each entree comes equipped with it's own little mini ""salad"" -- I have placed salad in parenthesis because it was literally 4 pieces of lettuce, 2 cucumbers, and 2 slices of tomato; obviously not the highlight of the meal.  The chicken kabobs were decent, healthy portion of rice served with this dish (never a bad thing in my book), but you have to order the yogurt sauce as a separate side; I didn't therefore my chicken lacked a tad in flavor.

All in all there's not much to report regarding the service since it's pretty much a ""fast food"" type Mediterranean eatery where you seat yourself, order, pick up your food and grab your own drinks from the drink station.

We shared two yagyu specials for the table (skirt steak, ribeye, and short rib) plus an order of tongue.  Eric R. also got shrimp and a salmon avocado roll, Steve got kimchi, and we all split a wakame soup from the suggestions of Misti and Bobby.

The soup was pretty amazing, so I would go back for that in a minute!  The broth was flavorful, and it had long strands of egg (my kind of egg drop yo!), wakame and green onions.  They gave us 5 small bowls and we were all able to share it (and one order is only $4.50).  

Surprisingly, the ribeye was least fatty of the meats but my favorite nonetheless.  The only dipping sauce I really liked of the 4 was the sesame oil that was seasoned with some salt.  Eric R. and I also got our own bowls of rice which was a great addition to our meal.  The meats overall tasted great, and I especially liked the marbled tongue.  It was a real treat that I am glad we tried!

Jen S. and I also grilled up the kabocha garnishes from the meat plate and that was actually a really great idea!  I did not get a chance to try the kimchi but Steve and Anthony seemed to like it.  I had one shrimp (hard to mess that up!) and one taste of Eric's sushi - this isn't the place for sushi but it was perfectly fine.

When I return, it is wakame soup, tongue and ribeye for me plus the ice cold beer.

krbrKqpgt9SCdP7NmiKyhA,_uqIpl5tzucKuIlZZPBZRw,wiPtQK7_QAkUUMQtyiaUNg,2,2,0,0,"Wow.  I've got to update my review.  We went to Mimi's Cafe for breakfast for the first time in quite some time.  So many things have changed, and I'm not just talking about the revised, blander menu.  

We went on Memorial Day, a Monday, at around 9:30 a.m.  It wasn't very busy yet, so we were seated right away (by our server, in fact; I guess there was no host on duty yet).  There were tables scattered here and there with people, but nothing significant.  

Our server was great.  He was very friendly and attentive...at least until it was time for the check and he was overwhelmed with the now-crowd of diners.  It looks like the kitchen and management are where the problems lie.  For breakfast, it took wayyyyyy too long for us to get our food (between 30-45 minutes), especially when the restaurant was not yet crowded.  We never once saw a manager; nobody when we walked in or out or walking the dining room to apologize for/correct the food delays.  And, sadly, the food was just average.  Gone are the days when a Mimi's breakfast stood out from the crowd.  My ham and cheese omelet was nothing special and looked sloppily assembled.  We could/should have just gone to IHOP for better, quicker food.  

On a related note, it seems the Mimi's Cafes I used to go to in Orlando have closed due to poor service and a decline in food quality.  It looks like Charlotte's is not far behind.  We won't be back.

p.s. The free wi-fi never worked for me either, which I wouldn't have noticed except we waited forever for our food.",2015-05-26 15:39:22

""A lil tequila lime chicken please,"" I said. Their idea of ""lil"" is not the same as mine, but do not mistake this as a complaint. Generous portions of all your typical fixings (lettuce, pico, guac, cheese, peppers) plus unique ones such as noodles (A MUST!) and ""crunchies"" (AKA those hot-as-death chips) are piled sky-high to the point one must wonder, how will these wonderfully nice people close this burrito?

It's a true art what they do here, managing to fit all those toppings into one tortilla is a skill most enviable. The tequila lime is my favourite, but my partner in crime swears by the baja chicken. I've also tried the baked yam (though don't be fooled: to heat it up they do toss it in the deep fryer for a minute) and it was awesome, again huge portions. The pulled pork is my friend's fave, but it wasn't for me. They have a large selection of flavours, as well as quesadillas that are built much the same. 

Be warned: the hot sauce here is super hot! The last time I got a burrito here I passed on all things spicy.

Who does that!? I've been wearing glasses for 10 years now and have never had to deal with something so ridiculous. 

After my first fitting and my lenses got smeared, they sent them back and received the second pair a week and a half later. Those got smeared during the adjustment process too. Those were sent back and on my 3rd pair, the people realized that they'll have to put a cloth over the lenses to not get them too hot so they won't smear. What a hassel! This place is so far from my house and every time I need adjustments, I have to come back here in hopes that my lenses won't smudge and I'll be screwed out of glasses. I've had those glasses since last February and about 6 months in, the anti-glare began rubbing off at the bottom and continued to do so until my frames snapped two nights ago. 

My husband's anti-glare actually got smudged because he left his glasses out in the car one day and then tried to clean them. This place offers a one year warranty on their lenses so they replaced them for free, but it was still an incredible inconvenience. I will never recommend anybody nor return here again. My father-in-law also purchased a pair of glasses here and had the same problem of the anti-glare wearing after a couple of months. So cheap. Go across the street to Lenscrafters where you pay a little more but you only have to wait one hour instead of 1 month to get a pair of working glasses.",2011-06-29 03:35:51

I took one star away becasue we who got the waffles didn't get the toasted walnuts that are standard with the dish. Since we were deep in conversation, we didn't notice until it was too late.  They should know better, however.

I'm giving The District Five Stars because I have come to adore The District over the past couple years. It has strangely enough become a staple of my trips to Henderson. I often look forward to a trip to The District as it hosts many of my favorite shopping spots. Normally I head over for a few reasons: I need cards from Hallmark, I'd like to browse Williams & Sonoma or pop into the doggy boutique to buy some treats for my dogs. The District also hosts Whole Foods as well.

As for restaurants I've been to a few of them: Al's Garage, Presidio Rachel's Kitchen, of course, the Panera Bread, and Coffee Bean (love it!). 

They have events, you can see people walking their dogs and honest to goodness it almost feels like you aren't really in Vegas anymore when you're here.

Second the snack area is just awesome, no other theater I've been to has a Starbucks coffee, hand scooped ice cream, and a cafeteria style check out. 

I went here today on a semi-date with my husband. (While we were here together and at the same time, we were in different theaters, watching different movies.) Buying tickets I saw the best thing ever. A movie style poster stating that kids under six will not be permitted to go into rated R movies after 6PM. OMG jerks who bring their kids to inappropriate movies and let them ruin it by yelling and not removing them when they get loud is one of my biggest pet peeves. Knowing that I can go here and not have to put up with that crap will keep bringing me back. LOVE IT!!!",2010-10-07 03:55:24

This place has the feels... you know the feels, when you need a bohemian, tropical vibe on a freezing Montreal day, yeah, those feels! The inside is super tropical, yet minimalist and clean.

There is ample seating, you would never guess from the way it is tucked into a quiet part of bustling downtown Montreal that it would be so SPACIOUS! This is a great place for groups. The food was delicious as well! I'm always in the mood for a delicious vegetarian meal, and this menu has been curated well. I met my buddy from Austin for a light dinner on a Tuesday evening. I started with a Mango/ turmeric lasso- which I'll admit was my least favorite part- WAY too much turmeric and not enough mango flavor. We had the quinoa fritters to start which were absolutely delicious! I need to learn how to make these. I had the LOV Burger with onion rings and loved every bit of it. My partner and buddy ordered two very good dishes, one was a zucchini squash dish that I don't see on the menu and I can't remember the other one. The food is what knocks this rating down a star.

He asked us questions first what we were looking for or craving and what we didn't like. The drinks he brought out were so delicious and refreshing. I had a grapefruit drink and my boyfriend had a cucumber one. Sammy informed us that all the vodkas are in house infused with the fruits and veggies. Which is a good touch because they really were some of the best cocktails we had. Then our appetizer arrived. Sammy had ordered us the cheddar fondue which came with warm soft pretzels, sausage, apple slices, and of course cedar fondue. Shortly after or dinners arrived he order my boyfriend a burger and fries best burger I've tried since I moved to AZ hands down. Sammy had ordered me the skewers. That came with a little bit of everything. Chicken, beef, veggies and shrimp skewers. Also can with a red pepper dip and this amazing honey muster glaze sauce which I put on everything!!!!

We came in right when it opened so it wasn't busy. Pretty comfortable, modern, ambience. I eat pretty much vegan style so I asked the waitress about vegan options. She recommended the hummus platter & also they can alter anything on the menu to make it vegan like eliminating any cheese or dairy in a dish etc. 

I ended up ordering the broccoli appetizer & hummus platter which tasted really good. My husband got the pretzel without cheese but they still put out a side of cheese just in case lol We also ordered a flat bread with tomato sauce, mushrooms & olives & potato dish. We got the hummus platter & pretzel & got full so fast. Between the two of us, we are lightweight consumers.

It was taking quite awhile to get the other dishes so luckily as we were waiting, my husband brought a lil medical mj chocolate bar from the dispensary the other day to hold him off. While we waited, we ended up getting full. The restaurant started filling up & our view of the basketball game that was blocked. 

 The waitress finally came out & said that the potato dish we ordered comes with butter & asked if he still wanted it & we were like no thank you. She should have asked us that when she took our order but at the same time we were actually relieved because we were already full. I asked about the other dish & she said it was coming out soon. 

Everything was pretty good there. The service was just a bit slow but maybe she was having a bad day or because it looked like business was starting to pick up.

Decor: Loved the full wall mural and seating. Menu looked like it was written in chalk on the top of the wall.

Food: We ordered 2 hotdogs, fries and mini-donuts (I was surprised they had donuts!). First, the 2 hotdogs we tried were: Fancy Francine and Kimchi Dog. Fancy Francine bit - it had a whole egg sunny side up with bacon and hollandaise sauce underneath. Tough to eat but tasty. The kimchi dog was a korean twist with kimchi, seaweed and mayo. Similarly, tough to eat but tasty. The buns for both were soft and fresh. Flavour-wise, the toppings were great but I found the hotdogs to be a bit tough to bite through - perhaps the it could have been cut a bit before serving. Fries were great. But by far the best and perhaps most surprising was the mini-donuts - we ordered a 6-pack of the nutella glazed with crush biscotti - wow - this was amazing!!!

The reason I love this particular location so much is because it's in a good area (Edgemont), the crowd isn't sketchy (like I sometimes find it to be in the other locations of Superstore) and depending on which day you go, it's not always insanely packed. I also love that they always carry every single last item on my grocery list, including the items on my 'Indian shopping list' such as basmati rice and chickpea flour. The produce section is always well stocked and it's rare that they run out of items before restocking them. The prices are always reasonable and they carry Joe Fresh clothing which I love to peruse!

The parking situation is also good and it's located in the Country Hills Plaza so you can pick up movie rentals, drop off your dry cleaning, pick up some pizza and even grab a couple of blizzards from Dairy Queen on your way home :)

I thought I went to the wrong street but I checked the address and my map location and apparently it was supposed to be in front of me. What I saw was Valens restaurant and wondered if the place had closed down without notice. Apparently it's the same place but called two different names?  Anyway, I wasted about 20 mins bc of the name discrepancy.

The service, food and atmosphere was great. Water is always being refilled, and food was brought to our table in a timely manner. Although it's a rather small place, a reservation should do the job--we had 20 people come for our reservation!

There's quite a selection to choose from. It's also vegetarian and vegan friendly. It was nice to hear them clarify whether the vegetarian dish was to be made vegan.

I liked the bread they served at the beginning. It was very soft and not chewy at all! For my main meal, I got the frutti de mare. For the price, the portion was fair. I love seafood, so I quite enjoyed the dish. Sometimes there's too much tomato taste at other places, but the seasoning and sauce was done wonderfully here.

Overall, the food is good. The place is hard to find, but it all worked out in the end. :p",2017-09-09 00:29:33

Mushroom Cheddar Burger with added Beach Salad - Really, juicy burger and that beach salad - so refreshing!

Blackened Basa Fish Dinner - really tasty basa meal; spice was just right!

Bombay Butter Chicken - great bowl of butter chicken with carrots, basmati rice on a small banana leaf, papadum.  Great blend of everything.

Sicilian Shrimp Linguine - Soooooo delicious!  It's a pesto sauce of pine nuts, currants, and all kinds of good stuff,   Lots of baby shrimp but done really well.

We started off with the charcuterie board, it was really nice, a good selection of meat and some killer mustard. We decided to share some apps, the burrata with asparagus and ramp pesto, the grilled octopus and the crispy pigs ears. The ears weren't my deal but the burrata was killer, so creamy and the pesto was delishhhh. Now for the main event...the bestellen burger.... I have dreams about this burger. Dear lawd it is killllerrrrr. One of the best burger I've ever had in my life, yup I said it and it's true. The sharp raclette cheese, the sweet caramelized onions on a freshly made (like 3 hours earlier according to the server) brioche bun. I can't even tell you what my husband or friends had because I was too busy eating. If you go to bestellen get the burger. We finished off with the panna cotta and something with chocolate. They both rocked. On the way out we were lucky enough to run into owner rob rossi (although I didn't know he was a famous food network star!). He was very nice and ensured we had a great time.

Also the fact that they were repairing the bathrooms during business hours was quite frank as you can hear the workers drilling away (it was really loud, quick tip may want to compete repairs before or after business hours). Now to the tacos, they were above average at best as nothing spectacular about it: cabeza, pastor, longaniza, and tripa. There was no salsa bar described by others but bottles of there salsa itself. I gave it an extra star as the price cannot be beat, $1.10 for the three tacos for tacos Tuesday special and $1.50 for the tripa taco! I believe all tacos are $1.50 on a regular day. Total paid was $4.90 for four tacos, which is unheard of nowadays as most tacos shops charge at least $2 per taco. You get more variety here and bang for your buck.

A second is coming soon to Summerlin. Cafe Zupas has had great success in Utah and Arizona. They offer homemade soups, freshly made salads, paninis, and gourmet sandwiches. I was fortunate to receive an invite to a VIP party that allowed Frank and I to sample various menu items. All guests were warmly welcomed and encouraged to sample the Try 2 Combo, which comes with a whole sandwich, half soup and half salad for $7.99. The Kid's Meal Combo is $3.99.

Salads are made in front of you as you order, soups are made fresh daily in Cafe Zupas' kitchen, and sandwiches are fixed when you place your order. It is quite the assembly line. I chose the Tomato Basil soup with Orzo Pasta, topped with asiago cheese for .59, their signature salad Nuts About Berries and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini. Frank had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. They got started on our orders right away, all components were added to our tray, we selected Brownies for dessert and our order came with Belgian Chocolate Covered Strawberries. By the time you pay your tab (ours was gratis on this visit), your order is complete and ready to be whisked away to a cozy table in the dining room.  

We dug into the soups first, the Tortilla soup is fantastic and loaded with flavor. It was so tasty Frank devoured it before I could snap a photo. The Tomato Basil was good, but less of favorite. It's quite sweet and very heavy on basil flavor. I hear the Wild Mushroom Bisque is not to be missed so I'll try that one next time.

Next, we tried the salads, I had the better of two with Nuts About Berries. It was loaded with fresh berries and topped with cinnamon almonds and lightly dressed with poppyseed dressing. It' a bit sweet, but not cloying so it was enjoyable. The BBQ Chicken salad was loaded with tomatoes, black beans, corn, olives, red onion and dressed with buttermilk ranch. What it lacked was BBQ chicken. There are ten other salads to choose from one is sure to strike your fancy.

Unfortunately, the sandwiches were the weakest link. This is a shame because their Italian Ciabatta bread is really fresh and delicious. The BBQ Pulled Pork tasted more like honey mustard that BBQ. It wasn't a very hearty sandwich. Sadly, the turkey wasn't very good. It tasted like prepackaged deli meat. I prefer freshly sliced deli meats. I expected actual artichokes on the sandwich, but it was a spread. That was my mistake, the menu clearly states a three cheese artichoke spread. I overlooked it. Truly, the bread is so good, I'd try the gourmet sandwiches again. I'm interested in the Asian BBQ Pork and the Vegetarian.

Dessert ended the meal on a pleasant note. I love Belgian Chocolate Dipped Strawberries so those alone wooed me, but the brownies were quite good and oh, so decadent. Gooey caramel and candy topped one and the other was more of a bar with coconut, nuts, chocolate and other goodness. 

The staff was incredibly friendly, they gave out dozens of prizes including water bottles and giftcards. Discounts and prizes will also be given out during their Grand Opening celebration on May 18.

The sauce was a deep red color and the meat tasted ok.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  This restaurant very much resembles a fast food Chinese take out place.  I wonder if they misspelled ""Carribean"" on their receipt on purpose when it's supposed to be 2 b's instead of 2 r's.  The steamed rice was on the hard side and not that great.

We settled on the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tikka Masala. We also ordered some garlic naan. Our server was incredibly personable and offered us refills on our water while we waited as well as made some idle chit chat with us. 

Once our food arrived, we paid our bill and off we went with our food. The server also offered us a to-go menu for our return visit. Great customer service!

My fella and I dug into our meal as soon as we got home. The spice level was just right. We ordered the medium spice level to be on the safe side on our first visit. The garlic naan was delicious and I really enjoyed the rice. The flavors were right on and I look forward to a return visit to hopefully eat in the restaurant and try some of their samosas.

Their mezzanine is fabulous and I would probably push someone over a ledge for a seat. Their delightful whitewashed walls often feature charming local art. There is a patio out front (which unfortunately faces an abominable sculpture), which is pretty busy in the summer. There's no wifi, so it's not a place to work, but an enjoyable place to chill.

The place was also described as a typical Japanese cafe.  Have been to Japan three times and there is nothing that indicates a typical cafe except for a tiny place in Osaka that had curry and 5 other things on the menu.  

I would recommend removing that banner.  The food is not fusion and it detracts from what you are really trying to do.  The service here is decent, but I'm still struggling with the typical cafe thing.  The menu is a mix of some Izakaya style dishes...Japanese curry and the Japanese version of Hanbaga, with a Korean pork and kim chee highlighted by some desserts that you might see in a cafe/coffee shop.  I still have had much better parfaits and desserts.  

Heard the chef/owner is from Sushi Roku and I wish him the best.  Focus on the food and forget the fusion.  The Japanese Hamburger and the Curry is a great start for the concept.  The creative desserts can be another aspect, but go the extra mile and do something more.  I get the impression of settling on a little of this and that.

I would probably go back once or twice a year unless the food improves.  Get rid of the metal chopsticks as well.  Wooden is preferable in a Japanese establishment.

Always enjoyed creme brÃ»lÃ©e and I was super excited to try one of his many creations. He offer a variety of interesting flavours that all sound so yummy. I chose the Vietnamese coffee paired with a scoop of earl gray ice cream. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e was tasty, coffee flavour was strong, it was drizzled with condense milk and I enjoyed watching it being torched infront of me. I felt that the earl gray ice cream was definitely needed or some kind of ice cream because it helps to balance out the sweetness and rich flavour of the Vietnamese flavour creme brÃ»lÃ©e. The ice cream was made perfect in my opinion as earl gray taste was present, it was creamy and not overly sweet. The owner actually recommended to have the ice cream first then my creme brÃ»lÃ©e after in my particular pairing. 

Moreover, the atmosphere of this place was pleasing and comfortable. You can study or hang out with your group of friends. He definitely made use of every square footage of this place. Also the selection of desserts from ice cream to creme brÃ»lÃ©e and waffles. I will definitely come back to try the waffles because the pictures I've seen on yelp look so yummy.",2018-03-16 00:27:00

The restaurant itself is large inside.  We chose to be seated in the bar section so we could watch the hockey game.  No problems there.

We both ordered pizza.  I had the ""Nick"" special - ordering the smallest of the three sizes (10 inches).  When it arrived it had about 6 full sized slices.  The crust was decent - much better than chain pizza crust.  There were a lot of tasty toppings, and I was full on about 4 slices.  My pedometer said I was at 12,000 steps for the day with about another 3,000 to get back to the hotel so I downed the next two slices.  

We also ordered ice cream for dessert.  Its not on the menu as an option but our waitress was more than willing to make it available.

Stopped in here on a whim and tried some fried tofu and a glass of beer. Okay, things went well, taste was good so on to the spring rolls. The rolls had great texture and were full of fresh ingredients with tasty dipping sauce.

Great place to eat (additional parking to the north) and the bill for two was under $20.

So how come I've never tried a Sonoran Hot Dog before? They've gained a lot of popularity in recent years thanks to Tucson restaurants like El Guero Canelo. I was very happy to see they opened a new location in the west valley on McDowell Road.

Today I picked up lunch for a friend on my way over to his place. Without asking what he wanted, I decided to pick up some variety. Two Sonoran Dogs were an obvious choice. I also chose two chicken tacos, a side of refried beans and chips.

The cashier was very friendly and when she suggested the chips, she mentioned that they were made fresh each day (and they were really good). In fact, they were better than some I've had in nicer restaurants. But the beans.... They were amazing. Seriously, the refried beans here are better than homemade! My friend mentioned how much he liked the chicken tacos. For something so simple (grilled chicken, cabbage and corn tortillas) they were incredibly flavorful. All I added was some pico de gallo.

And finally, the Sonoran Hot Dog was worth every penny. Bacon makes everything better, but the hot dog itself was tasty. And you wouldn't think that mayo and beans would go together, but it all works. The flavors may not be as bold as the sport peppers on a Chicago Dog, but I will not pass up another opportunity to enjoy a Sonoran Dog again.

They also had organic hand pressed juices, but the price was too expensive for me to try. :( $8.95! This roastery and cafe is the first of their many locations around the city. They focus on getting every drink right, and even use organic milk!

The place is in two floors, with the second floor being more cozy and quiet than the lower floor. The cafe has beautiful brick walls giving it such a cool ambience. The big chandelier is such a beautiful piece, lighting up the entire cafe.

My husband got their double shot of espresso with a hint of milk. We don't particularly like acidic coffee, but hubby said it is acidic at a comfortable level, you know, not so acidic that the coffee tastes bitter.

I, not being a coffee lover, tried their Parisian Mist - a latte made with French Breakfast tea. I fell in love immediately! It tastes kind of like a chai tea latte, but it is still black tea, if that makes any sense. There is a hint of something that makes it completely different from other black tea lattes out there.

Collette is personable, easy going, and considerate. Texted me in advance, a map pic of where she was and texted me again to let her know when I'm there, so she can open the door for me.  Her room is still being decorated, since she recently moved to this salon location.

I showed her a few pictures of what I was looking for in length and style. I came around a picture that had a purple tint at the ends and I randomly asked her if she can do my lashes this color. To my surprise, she had all sorts of colors and the purple I wanted. I asked her what's her most popular color request and shockingly, not many people ask for it. Maybe perhaps they don't know they could get away with such discreetness in color or all they know is the ordinary black. Well I'm here to tell you.. it's such a mystical charm to have some color to your lashes, especially if you're paying a great amount of money to get them done. The best part of these Purple Ombre Tint Lashes is it's only visible in light. I can even get away with these lashes at work, since it looks so natural :) hehehe hahaha 

You'll feel some poking and tugging at times when the lashes are added, but the whole session took less than 1.5 hours. The fumes did get me good at the end when I opened my eyes, but after it finally dried, my lashes it came out oh so lovely. She gave me this sweet look, which I like, since I can be mean muggin sometimes. I love the hidden color though. I can't rave enough about it.

There really was not one thing that I didn't like on my visit to here. I'll start off by saying what stood out was how the bartenders and employees were overly kind to us and were more than accommodating to our big group. Thankfully, they have a room just for such occasions and it truly is perfect for special events. The drinks that were ordered came out exotic looking and super delicious. The food was also not only very presentable but tasted amazing. I ordered the pulled pork tacos and the pork was so tender and cooked to perfection! The green sauce, not sure what it was called, just made it that much better. Our server was always around when needed and was more than helpful.

The place definitely has a charm to it that I really love. Its fancy yet casual at the same time so you feel comfortable in whatever kind of setting or group your in. I love that if you just want to grab a drink with a group of friends they have couches on the sides where you can just relax and catch up with friends.

Previous visits merited satisfied customers, including my friend's fiancee who is notoriously hard to please (he's not so much picky as a perfectionist with high expectations for quality food).

When deciding where to go for our February Girls Night, after considering other favorites, we settled on BLT, as it had been a few months since we enjoyed their happy hour.  Apparently, in those few months, their quality has declined.

Due to a current medical condition, I ordered Pellegrino sparkling water.  My friend ordered iced tea, out of solidarity.  Boring I know, but it's not like we only got plain old tap.  We ordered, sharing their fantastic popovers (which were still pretty darn good, despite the rest of the evening's shortcomings), the fried calamari and a burger.  We were served the popovers and before we took a second bite, there was a runner hovering, wanting to deliver our calamari and burger.  Really?  Rushing us out the door?  Despite it being tourist season, neither the bar nor restaurant were at all busy.  Someone screwed up by not pacing our order to come out at varied times.

In a nod to my current condition, I'd been cautioned to avoid undercooked meat.  Normally I am a big fan of rare to medium rare beef, especially in a place supposedly known for quality products.  I just can't bring myself to order well done, so we compromised, requesting the burger medium.  I figured that would be safe enough.  

We continued to enjoy the popovers and the calamari.  The calamari was good, and I enjoyed the green herbal/garlic aioli sauce on the side.  When we finally cut the burger, it was rare plus at best, a far cry from the medium ordered.  Despite the cute little plastic tag sticking out of the bun suggesting the kitchen had heeded our request, they clearly had not.

Our waitress stopped by to check on us and we pointed out the error with our burger.  I explained to her that normally we love the cow practically still mooing, but due to my current status, I need to avoid rare beef.  She offered to have the kitchen correct their mistake.  A few moments later, the food runner brought a burger back to us.  The original burger is served uncut.  This one was cut in half.  At first we thought it was a bit suspicious, but maybe the kitchen cut it to make sure they cooked this one correctly, or perhaps they cut it as they knew we were sharing.  We each took a bite and were sorely disappointed to realize we received our original burger, not a freshly made one cooked to our desired doneness.  The kitchen just took our original burger (which sat at room temperature for at least 25 minutes while we ate our other food), slapped it back on the grill until it was charred on the outside, and put it back on the bun.  It was still rare inside.  This is the kind of thing I would expect from Ruby Tuesday, not Laurent Tourondel's namesake.  Upon closer  inspection, the slice of bacon was even sticking out of the bun at the same angle as the original.  

We debated ordering something else, and decided to try dessert instead.  After waiting and waiting for our waitress to return, we just wanted to get out of there and satisfy our sweet tooth elsewhere.  The waitress finally appeared and asked if she could clear the plates.  I wasn't really going to make a big deal of the uneaten burger, but when she didn't even ask  why we hadn't eaten it, I had had enough.  I graciously informed her that we were done with the burger as it was quite obvious the kitchen didn't make us a new one, only re-fired our incorrectly cooked first burger.  She stated she would remove the burger from our check, which we appreciated.  We asked for the check, which we received fairly promptly.

Waiting another 20 minutes for our waitress to return and collect the folio with a card sticking out of the top, we finally decided to just leave cash and get out of there.

It was most definitely a disappointing experience.  When I relayed the events to my husband, he suggested we might give them one more try.  I will have to think about that, considering there are so many other places that have never disappointed me.",2014-02-05 18:15:54

The decor and the ambiance are tip-top. The menu is very unique. An eclectic mix of Asian dishes. We started off with two sets of dumplings - Smoked Pig Face and Smoked Bok Choy. Both very delicious. The pig is definitely the moist, fatty dark meat. I love it, but perhaps not for all. The Bok Choy turned out to be very flavorful. Lots of spice to it as well. 

We had a mix of entrees. Scallop special (only 4 scallops, but well done), Mission Chinese Kung Pao Pastrami (spicy and delectable), Kimchi Fried Rice (a bit salty, but well done), and the Roasted Pork Noodles (very tasty). 

I think that the only thing lacking was the service. It started off good, but went downhill fast. That said, I will chalk it up to the place being brand new when we dined there.

Food:
Yia Yia's Pasticcio a Greek style lasgna that's topped with Greek Bechamel is a very popular dish to order here so if you want a slice of savory goodness I'd get here early for lunch.  If you make your meal a combo, get the Feta Fries!!!! Crisped golden fries topped with Feta cheese that's melted slighty. A different and delicious twist to eating french fries for sure!
  
Everytime  I order a Gyro and take a pic and post it, my friends are jealous cause here I am sitting having this huge Gyro that's filled with tender slices of beef(they also have choice of lamb and chicken)  feta cheese topped with a genourous amount of  their Tzaziki sauce that's made from scratch. Real light refreshing taste. Their Tzaziki sauce is gold!!
 
Ohhh the Grilled Garlic Shrimp is another plate that stands out. Shrimp is plump, jumbo size, it's an insanely garlickly & buttery masterpiece.  The Chef behind all these delicious dishes worked for notable chefs on the Strip. So you are in for a real treat when you dine here!

 I must not forget dessert!! The most important meal  I never ever miss ;)  You cant beat Yia Yia's Rice pudding to top of your meal!!  Im not a big puddin fan but after Chef came over with a sample of rice pudding for me to try, I can say I am fan of rice pudding!! At least  the way Alice makes it here. What sets it apart is  it's creamy but has an amazingly light texture, with hint of cinammon.   Enough said. Don't pass up this comforting dessert.  The proof is in the puddin'!

*Cheap lunch menu
*2nd floor

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is located on the 2nd floor on Dundas Street just before you hit Spadina Street. Once you walk upstairs, you will see how small the restaurant is (narrow and long). There were many Chinese middle aged men having lunch when I dropped by.

Ordered: Mexican Fried Rice (seafood) 3/5

*Served with soup (choice between winter melon/borscht)
*Went with Winter melon soup
*Worst soup I've ever tasted and didn't know what it was suppose to taste like
*Comes with mussels, shrimp and squid
*Big in portion, but the rice is very bland
*There is hint of curry flavor
*Needs some kind of sauce (hot sauce)

Ordered: Baked Porkchop on Rice 3/5

*Served with soup (choice between winter melon/borscht)
*Went with Borscht, it was so watery (tasted like water and ketchup)
*Huge portion
*It came a little burnt on top, but there was no cheese on top 
*Instead of 2~3 big pieces of porkchop, it was small chopped up pieces
*Tomato sauce was decent (tasted like tomato soup + mushroom soup)
*There were generous amounts of mushroom and onion pieces
*Prefer one from the House of Gourmet although the tomato sauce is better here

The marinara was filled with chunky tomatoes and had a very nice flavor, just a little bit sweet, just like I like it!   The entree.....where do I begin!!!!    The server brought out a huge bowl of linguine, topped with fresh basil, loads of freshly topped tomato and an ample portion of perfectly cooked shrimp.  I also received a side of freshly grated parmesan without having to request it.   The pasta was piping hot, flavorful and the portion was HUGE.

ANYHOW, most will agree that NOTHING  beats the smell of fresh coffee in the morning. Or tea. Steeped tea in particular, is tried and true morning picker upper. 

i will confess that I am a Timmies fanatic and hold it dear to my heart, and it pains me to write such a review about one that was so dear; but I am so VEXED and I need to vent. I am giving this location a 2 star cuz i have nostalgia but really it's a ONE.

This particular location has been dear to be for as long as I can remember- it's been my go-to place on any day or night for a lil bit of java fix, whether it be during cramp time for exams or just to catch up with a buddy over a warm cup(s) of whatever; it was open 24 hrs for the longest time which made it the perfect spot.

Then it wasn't 24hrs anymore except on Fridays and Saturdays which bites but still good. I have always enjoyed the quick service here even when the line went out the doors and had no problems returning to THIS location even though there are many within walking distance, until recently.

So Currently I am working two jobs; one in day and one in night because I am insane. This makes good cup(s) of java essential to my being awake; I can't imagine how much more I spend at Timmies these days.Anywho.

Since I have started my night gig(4 months ago), I can't seem to get no satisfaction from this place. The coffee is ALWAYS burnt - I thought maybe it was because I came near closing time that it may be the case. But no, any time after 5pm I have been here, the coffee is BURNT. So I switched to steeped tea; and the friggin TEA is burnt! How do you burn tea? Well it is brewed the way and stored same way coffees are so if it sits for a long time on the burner it burns. Why am I paying for burnt anything? Because the service was good. But the service of the night crew completely shat itself recently- I have never met such rude set of people who not only ignore your existence in the store ,rudely repeat after you, talk in another tongue in front of you(which I find rude) and openly roll their eyes at you. However, beggers can't be choosers and I continued to drink burnt crap because all other Timmies in the area closes before 11pm - until recently. 

Recently I discovered that this particular set of people -do not practice what we know to be a Timmies practice? you know, writing the time when the pot was brewed and dumping it after a certain time- they ran a national campaign for that not too long ago- yeah, they don't do that here during the night shift.
If they are ignoring one of the most fundamental things that makes Timmies what it is , I dare ask what else they're not doing so I am taking my tiny broken wallet else where.

That is all. I am done ranting.",2013-09-04 04:56:36

Well finally went back today and it was one of the loveliest places i've ever been in the city. The Plateau has many gems and this is definitely one that stands out. The Cafe is in a little building - well a house converted into a cafe ! 

The decoration is a mix of vintage & eclectic style - TrÃ¨s a mon goÃ»t ! There are many different sitting areas and all the way in the back , theres a magical garden ( yes magical!)  filled with green vegetations, trees and even a little pond. A place where ( in the summer time of course)  you could spend all your mornings - afternoons & evenings ( all day, errrydayyy)  just reading a book, enjoying nature or delighting in philosophical convo's about life. That little magical place even lits up at night to resemble a fairy's den  - or what i imagine a fairy's den would look like if it existed.

Unfortunately we didn't eat any meals there - only a drink and some ice cream. I had an iced coffee late with a hint of mint ( which i asked for) and my friend had vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and fruits. We thoroughly enjoyed our drink and food and shall go back to sample the main meals and/or entrees.

*Bonus This place sells books for 3$ - which, being a book lover pretty much sealed the deal for me - of course i purchased a book by Albert Camus - & only that one because i didn't have any more change than 3$. Last little amazing surprise , My friend stumbled upon a game of psychology, where you get to ask random behavioural questions - the type that answer to ''what would you do if'' . My friend and i promised to gather up a group of friends and head back there just for that game.

Go there for a date, go there for lunch, go there to spend some time solo, go there with friends...but just go or you will be missing out on this beautiful little gem of a Cafe.

Normally I stay on the strip at the Mirage for about $99 a night after obnoxious resort fee.  But normally I do Sunday, Monday, Tuesdays, not popular weekends that can cost as much as $239 a night BEFORE the obnoxious aforementioned resort fee.  But I had great seats to finally see k. d. lang -- AND SO -- I went bargain shopping.

All bargains led me to the Vegas Station casinos.  And all Yelp reviews cautioned that you get what you pay for.  And so the idea of abandoning the entire casino thing hit me and I was like, hey, how about a Hampton Inn way off the strip.  

Instead I found this La Quinta.  Now, compared to the rooms and pool and spectacle of the Mirage, this was a joke.  But that's like comparing Carl's Jr to Houstons.  What I wanted was an affordable weekend rate -- which with AAA it was.  I also wanted some place to eat nearby in case I didn't feel like going all the way to strip quite yet.  Was I ever rewarded for that.

Two restaurants are practically in the parking lot:  FIREFLY Spanish Tapas and SIENA Italian cuisine.  The tapas was okay, a little loud inside, but fun and cheaper than the strip.  SIENA was amazing and easily the best Italian food bargain on and off the strip (see my related review).  Both of these restaurants are important to consider, because the 'fancy' eats in the Mirage are twice the price but not twice the quality.  So here was a foodie's HUGE payoff for the gamble.

Where my partner in crime and I got hosed was the pool and hot tub.  They had one of each.  They were clean.  They were small.  Someone made a decision whether parking was more important than the pool.  Parking won, which is unfortunate, because the pool was shrunken to ensure parking.  Instead of plants around the iron gates, you could hear every last noise of the adjacent apartment building complex.  Leaf blowers, trash collecting trucks, you name it.  It's strange that it was so noisy, because the hotel was otherwise quiet and cleverly off the main drag.

The rooms were a beige blah and fake wooden furniture.  However, they were clean and the beds firm.  They do need to rework their window shades to ensure actual darkness because a ton of light pours in.

So if you're used to strip elegance and demand it, pay through the eyeballs on the weekend to get it.  If, like me, you'd rather invest that mark up in good eats and see a few shows, this may be a place to try.  By the by, if you intend to stay here but visit the strip, you'll need a car.  Twenty minutes or so each way is ridiculous in a cab.  Thankfully many strip hotels offer free parking.

One warning:  my first night of sleep was lousy.  This was the fault of the staff and not the room.  See, the room has this tricky way of working the AC, and my window AC unit should have had a sign telling me to ignore the unit's buttons and instead find the wall thermostat by the bathroom.  Basically, my best advice here - or in any such hotel when you're in this situation -- is too insist someone show you how to use it if you can't figure it out.

One cool tip:  so you don't want to feel like a loser at this place but instead sip martinis in a fancy place?  THE RED ROCK CASINO is just minutes away.  Go there.  BE fabulous.  The savings at La Quinta will buy you a dinner with those martinis.",2011-10-27 22:21:19

The lady behind the counter was very friendly. The tea was delicious and I will have to return for more stuff.
   The pastry cases were very tempting. They were offering Coffee cake, Zucchini bread, Black and White cookies, and other baked goods that looked amazing. 
   They also had an assortment of cold drinks such as water, juice etc. The space is not very big but the vibe is very chill and I could see it being a good place to get some work or studying done. Stay tuned for an update on the coffee. 

**Update: Finally went back to try the coffee on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I had called in advance to see if they offered non-dairy milk and was told they had soy and almond...Yasss! Got myself an Almond Milk Cappuccino that was perfect! Velvety frothed milk and the right amount of espresso. This is the type of place University was needing. A cute coffee shop with WiFi, friendly service (Cameron was awesome), and actual coffee/espresso. 
  They also offer flavor syrups that come in Sugar-Free versions (although this means they use a sugar substitute and it does have some after taste). They were also hosting lots of events in February including Speed Dating, Open Mic and Live Music.

We played several of the MANY, many games until we received the text message that our table was ready. I was impressed with the menu!  Great selections, including beer and mixed drinks. The only reason that this review is not 5-star goes to food service. Let me be clear... the selection was great, and the food quality was great, but the service was struggling. We had a wonderful  waitress - very friendly and knowledgeable, but either she was overwhelmed, OR they aren't properly organized. I don't attribute that to her, but to food service management.

Each experience has been positive - as far as any medical visit could be.   The waits haven't been long.  The staff has been courteous.  The followup has been great.   The facilities are gorgeous.   

I would add a couple of opportunities for improvement (which is why there is one star missing from this review).  First, I think that they should add the ability to send email confirmations for appointments.   (In the one instance, the hospital called to schedule an MRI while we were on vacation and I had no way to write down the appointment time.  When I asked if they could send me an email confirmation, they said they weren't set up to do that).   The second opportunity is with the main parking garage.  The security guards were ""quizzing"" us as to the purpose of our visit.   My husband and I were both perplexed as to the line of questioning.

Small and intimate both inside and out, the new restaurant allows you to feel connected to the neighborhood surroundings as well as the wait staff and cooks.  We sat outside with a great backdrop of the botanical gardens and Glidden House next door (along with a seemingly full working outdoor ""kitchen') which I highly recommend (far more spacious than what can be a claustrophobics nightmare inside). That said, one caveat is the bianco and pasta tasting menus are only available indoors.

Cost: 3. Foodie-sized portions are taken to another level here versus some other spots in Cleveland. Also, tickets for the indoor tasting are more expensive for walk-ups than buying tickets online ahead of time ($100 for bianco) - fair? Probably not. The staff, experience, and of course food are no doubt are the cause of the extra money you're spending... which felt well worth it.

Food Quality: 5. Trentina's menu is modeled after Northern Italian cuisine. We had salad, the infamous Strangolapreti, lamb shoulder, and beef brisket (true outside grilling fun). All were A+, except for the lamb shoulder which personally was just a little on the fatty side for me, even understanding it's lamb. For desert, try the olive oil ice cream, it's fairly dense but a delicious gamechanger.

Service: 5. Service was prompt and courteous. Both J. Sawyer & his restaurant manager were heavily involved making sure both patio and indoor diners were happy.

I had been going to this place since my junior year at CMU and I find it to be the best breakfast place I have ever eaten at. Whenever I go back to Pittsburgh to visit friends or for Steelers games, I always try and hit up Pramanti Brothers, William Penn for the the Kitchen Sink Wings and De Luca's for their breakfast.

Well. There is always a line to this place. I've seen it go around the block sometimes but there are also times when you can be the first in line. It all depends on what the crowd is like. This place specializes in breakfast but you can also get lunch food as well. You have to pay cash and you will most likely not find street parking anywhere near there so look for a lot or try the streets around it. The place is ALWAYS crowded so if you see some seats open at the bar, grab them cuz those are first come first serve.

Onto breakfast, I've tried a lot of their options but I love their Steak Mixed Grill. This gets me a sliced medium rare steak, 2 eggs over easy, veggies, sweet roast peppers, tomatoes and home fries. This meal was one of the dishes that Adam Richmond ate when he went there for Man V Food. I'll usually get this with a strawberry milkshake (which is enormeous) and that will completely fill me up.

I've also had the eggs benedict which is really good, the famous breakfast burrito (best breakfast burrito I've ever eaten), the buttermilk pancakes (better than Pamela's short cakes) and a Greek Omelette.

However, I now that I only go back to Pittsburgh once or twice a year, I usually just get the steak mixed grill. De Luca's is so much better than Pamela's and Pamela's is a really good breakfast place too. I definitely love coming here.",2010-08-21 16:53:55

I am in love with the Wood Fired Olives appetizer here, we ordered that and it was totally on par with the Arcadia location.  My family ordered two pizza's the Giardino and the Margherita and said it was also on par with Arcadia and they looked great.    

My order was the Cowboy Rib Eye.  I typically bounce back and forth between the Chicken Marsala and the Filet, and I tell everyone the Filet at Nook Arcadia is the best $27 filet you will ever eat.   They don't offer the Filet here so I went with their new Ribeye which is $34 and served over smashed Yukon Gold potatoes with four asparagus spears on the side.  

Presentation and plating was beautiful... My mouth was watering... The ribeye was bone-in BUT it was full of fat and gristle, it was edible but I spent most of the time trying to cut around the gristle or pulling it out of my mouth. I don't mind fat in my steak I just prefer more to steak to fat, and not the tough gristle this steak had throughout.  The potatoes which were advertised as garlic parmesan were also bland and seem to be lack both garlic and parmesan. The asparagus was good.  This is not anything like the preparation or quality of the Filet at Arcadia and it was a 2 star dish for me for sure on the steak quality alone. I typically want to lick my plate at Nook but this wasn't the case the plate left the table with half a steak, lots of fat pieces and almost all the potatoes.  

This location charges more for the same dishes, understandably they are in the hotel, it is bigger and they likely have more expenses, however I was a little surprised to see the same Chicken Marsala offered at Arcadia was $5 more here.  

The valet parking is also expensive, $17 normally, $12 if you eat at the restaurant and get a stamp.  Find a parking spot if you can and don't valet, this isn't Nook's fault, just a tip.

The pork belly came out cut up in perfect two bite morsels for me.  A nice crunchy top with a soft underside is a great mix of meat goodness.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but not so much that it takes away flavor.  Plus it is a great sweet sauce for the meat.
We also had the Pan cit Malabon, which has a spaghetti type noodle that is cut up.  I mean the texture and thickness reminded me of a spaghetti noodle.  The shrimp was only ok, as noted by a dinner guest on mine.  I cannot comment as I am allergic to shellfish.  I did chance the noodles since the top is sprinkled with pork rinds.  Interesting, but not my first pick next visit.
The fired chicken was good, very crispy, but for the $7.99 price 2 pieces of chicken was not what I expected.  With everything else on the larger side I found this to be lacking in value for my dollar.
We also sampled the flan dessert, which was creamy and sweet.  Nice mix and most likely I would try again.  I also tried the Halo-halo which my first experience.

I tried their Game Sausage - Guinea Hen for $9.50. They add 2 toppings; their giardiniera/pickled veg is worth a try ($2 extra). Although it was pretty good, my only complaint is that this is a bit pricey for sausage on a bun. I regret not trying the fries. 

Their range of beers was even more impressive. There were hundreds of dark, wheat, malt, hopped and pale beers, ciders, wines ... more choices than you can wrap your head around.

Great casual atmosphere, but can get crowded and loud. You order your food at the cashier (or grab a seat at the bar), grab a number sign, find a seat and they'll bring you the food. There's benches all over (high school all over again?)",2017-11-06 18:54:27

Their second location being relatively new, is a great addition to the financial district.  Serving up some great craft and seasonal beers it's perfect for those beer experts who truly appreciate locally brewed draft.  
Their menu is full of popular pub fares that have no shortage of small portions.  
The ambiance can get loud depending if you're upstairs or downstairs and at what time of the day.  
Though I am more of a wine drinker I did give their Blonde and Amber beer a try which was crispy, light and refreshing. 
In terms of food our small group tried their Flammekueches (hard to pronounce) which was a flatbread pizza served with cheese, black olives, cheese and ham.  This definitely complimented our beers,however the next time I'll be sure to try some of their pub grubs to get a better sense of the menu.

After the relocation of a runway at Hopkins they forced the closure of the old location.  The old version was a real gem.  I will never forget how they had headsets at each table that you could listen to Hopkins ATC while eating.  Very Cool!  

The new location(Which has been here for several years now) is breathtaking.  They spent some serious money to make this place memorable.  The inside has awesome features and big widows to give you a nice vantage point of the airfield.  (Perfect to watch the 3 regional jets that depart every hour).  

As a fellow Yelper has posted, the bar has some free munchies during happy hour which is a nice touch.  My problem with the Bomb Group is it is a bit stuffy for my liking.  If i want to watch planes, I don't want it to be a white tablecloth event.  The entrees are good, however you will be paying about 20 dollars per plate.

Ikea has been open for over a month now & the lines at The Food Court are still massive. The portion sizes are perfect for small people or people dieting.... but at least they are reasonably priced. I had the Swedish Meatball plate & the hot Salmon plate, they were out of mashed potatoes for the Meatball plate so I substituted French Fries. First, the good: the French Fries were perfect- well cooked, hot & not skinny, also my customer interaction with everyone at Ikea, has been great- very friendly, super informative. Now for the bad: EVERYTHING else was over-cooked. These were well thought out plates, that should have been great..... just not well planned for a busy Cafeteria venue. They need to cook in smaller batches, watch sitting times in their storage ovens & taste & throw out old, over-cooked items &/or under-cook their food from the start, knowing that they will continue to cook in their storage ovens. One last thing, their 75 cent coffee, is the 2nd worst coffee that I have drank in Vegas...... but it was free with my Ikea Family Card.

This was my first dining experience at Ikea & even though it wasn't great, I plan on eating there every time, that I shop at Ikea, until I have tried their whole menu. I like to try different cuisines....... & Meatballs with Lingonberry Jam, is very different for me.

Firstly, I'll say that the woman who took my order over the phone was very nice. Bowl of Pho is also nice on the inside but I ordered my food to go so I can't really comment on their waitstaff.

Since everyone, their mothers and their grandmothers praise Superior Pho and pretty much claims everywhere else is mediocre (at best), I wasn't really hoping for the best. I was just hoping it was edible.

I ordered 2 orders of spring rolls, bubble tea (strawberry), fried rice (chicken), and deluxe beef noodle.

The bubble tea, while good, tasted... odd but not in a bad way though. It was very sweet and it tasted like a red licorice shake. O.o

Luckily, I love red licorice. But it definitely didn't taste like strawberry, not even remotely. The tapioca pearls were good too and in my opinion, they were better than *gasp* the ones at Superior Pho.

The food was pretty good too. The pho (which was my main dish) was terrific with a multitude of flavors and spices that hit the palate just right. Nice amounts of meat (not an overabundance but not super shady either). I had my food to-go so when I got home, I put in the the meat, sides and noodles which, because I'm  assuming they don't rinse off their noodles, were super starchy and was kinda congealed to the styrofoam to-go container. However, after me breaking it up a bit and placing them into the pho, they broke up a little bit so it wasn't just clumps of ramen sitting at the bottom of my bowl.

The chicken fried rice my husband ordered was really good.

The spring rolls were good as were the sauce but I have to admit that Superior Pho is well, superior with their spring rolls and the sauce (oh dear God, their sauccceeee!!).

All in all, I came in not expecting much and now I'm full of delicious food and a new Vietnamese spot to eat at when I don't want to trek all the way downtown.

We made a reservation for 7:30pm for my friend's birthday. I had the Osaka Cha-Han which is basically octopus fried rice. It was recommended here on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. Izakayas are generally not for filling up ur stomach and the price range is quite high. This was like $11ish dollars before tips and one of the budget-friendly items on the menu.

Flavour-wise this was decent, not too salty which is good because I don't really like salty things. The rice in particular stood out to me because it was really well cooked and chewy (sushi rice). But there was barely any octopus in it at all, literally a few pieces. Instead, u get a ton of rice. I would recommend ordering this along with something else for sharing. It's too bland on its own since it doesn't have many ingredients but the rice is good. I did have their promo (tako wasabi). It was pretty salty lol and very strong wasabi flavour. So if u like wasabi a lot u'll love it. Overall can't say much about this place because I didn't try anything else.",2018-06-26 18:28:14

Firstly, I encountered a staff who was borderline rude in this store. As I was looking at the sales racks in the petite section, there was another lady customer beside me. A staff walked up to her and was like ""this whole sale section is for petites"". The woman looked confused...The staff added"" you have items in your hand that looked like they are regular sized, that's why I pointed it out"". OK first of all, YOU DON'T comment on a lady's size!! I mean come on, I feel like I am not freaking petite, but I am in the petite section, you don't know how clothes fit on a person unless you are THAT person trying it on. Secondly, if something is on sale and it is a good deal, I WOULD LOOK and I will buy if they fit! Petite or not. The staff could have approached with a much nicer comment. What she said was not helpful, if the woman wants to look at the petite items, let her look at them! 

Secondly, all the staffs in this store, well except for the fitting room staff are extremely dead...like not lively. I had to approach people with questions. I see sale signs in select areas with additional 40% off, I asked the girl who was just boringly wandering around if it's just on the items with the sign over them or the whole store, she told me the whole store. She needs to definitely do a better job as the front door greeter, no one knows  this. If i had not asked, I would not have known. Later on, two other woman approached me and asked if I knew what's the deal about the sale and I had to explain it to them. Meaning, the lady at the front is practically useless. 

The staff in the fitting room were quite friendly. Smiled at me the whole time and took their time to introduce themselves. Trying clothes on was the best experience I had in the whole store. 

I don't care how nice your store looks, recently they renovated this store to look like a high end hotel. What I care about is how knowledgeable and helpful your staffs are.

No it's not.  We have more to discuss.  When you open a Biscuit House in ""The South"", we must critique  First, I have a question...H&D, how do you get your Biscuits so fluffy with the perfect amount of density on the inside and golden brown color on the outside without it disintegrating in my hand or getting grease all over my shirt???  Do tell your secret so I can slip the recipe to my grandma and politely tell her to up her game.

Aside from the Biscuits being awesome, so is the food.  I ordered the oats with brown sugar and strawberries.  Pretty sizable portion and made me feel healthy.  Then I dug into Hollerback sandwich, which had some awesome sauce, bacon, fried green tomato and guac.  It was so big that I ate this in two halves and enjoyed it for twice as long.  You get a side with a signature biscuit, so I went with the corn based on the recommendation from the cashier.  She was right.  The flavor was so on point, delicious and refreshing.

This place is pretty casual with a nice outdoor space.  It's a little confusing when they give you a number, and you need to find the small hole in the table to drop in the the number so it stands upright, but the manager came right over to where I was sitting and showed me what to do.

Overall, great fast casual place to grab a filling breakfast or lunch (they serve local Pure Intentions coffee).  Super addition to Southend.  I have no doubt this place will do great.  If anything, they might survive on my business alone.",2018-03-15 23:15:32

PROS:
- Food is great. Is there a better traditional breakfast in Pittsburgh?  I doubt it!
- The breakfast sandwich is my fave. Eggs, spicy sausage, and cheese on Mancini's bread. Just do it. 
- Service is very quick and efficient. Try to run out of coffee. You can't!
- The menu is huge, lots of good stuff to try. 

CONS:
- Its CASH ONLY, and it's now year 2018...  And that's all I can offer on the negative side.

This is a continuation from my TOCA dining experience, so go read that if you find this review lacking in crutial detail for it to make sense.

It was an unusually warm evening, so after our dinner upstairs at TOCA, Myself, Claire, Lucia and everyone else descended to DEQ, where I was earlier in the evening mentally preparing for dinner.  
We picked a spot at the terrace in front of the fireplace, and ordered ourselves some cocktails and ice wine from the same sommelier at the restaurant, only this time there was two of them, and they were both 6'5, making me my 6'1 ego feel uncomfortably around the five foot range.  Serious, how high are the racks at the Ritz?  DO they scout wine connoisseurs from NBA tryouts? 

The indoor decor was gorgeous, with seating for a dozen people, to just a table for one.  That is amazing and very considerate.  The ground floor terrace is enclosed within the hotel, and gave a private ambiance for an outdoor setting, which is remarkably in shortage in this city.  The ice wine I ordered wasn't available, which meant I was given the same bottle from an earlier year, and I was VERY happy about that.  That was probably a savings of a hundred dollars. 

We were the only people out at the terrace, and so we were able to talk as loud as a bunch of Mainland Chinese people were capable of talking, our waitresses was a lovely girl who forgot the details of my orders twice.  I asked for two cubes of ice in my red bull & vodka, the first time she give me like a dozen cubes of ice, the second time she gave me no ice.  I'll forgive her because her heels were so high, and I was so drunk. 

So why three stars?  Because The Ritz is an international name, and based on international standards, it's at best a three star venue.  Toronto seems to be an excuse to not make things extravagant.  The fear of people thinking someone else is pretentious had rendered this town into a melting pot of self deprecating, humility loving Janes & Joes....and it certainly reflect in our architecture. 

I imagine a four hour evening of partying for a dozen people would cost up to around $1200, which is very reasonable for the ambiance, service, and clientele.",2013-05-07 22:06:39

The peppers were very good but after looking at other tables I wished I had ordered the ""corn bones"" as they looked really, really good.

I used the Yelp app directions to find the location (duh!), and were psyched to find plenty of parking + no wait to sit down when we arrived without a reservation around 8pm on a Friday.  All of the employees that we encountered were extremely friendly and personable from the hostess and our server to Heather, another staff member that we recognized from another local cafe.  

Our server, Randy was attentive and offered recs on the menu when we asked.  We ended up sharing an order of the Guacamole Classico as an app.  I ordered it with both chips and raw veggies.  I love that the veggies are an option.  (Veggies are chilled just right and include carrots, celery, cucumbers, jicama and radish).   The guac is chunky and includes avocado, cilantro, serrano chiles, lime juice, salt, white onions, tomatillos, orange and cotija cheese.  We each had a beer from their selection of both Mexican and local options, and then shared two entrees: the Pescado del Dia and the Mole Negro.  The fish came with veggies and the mole chicken came with fried rice and tortillas.  

The ambiance is casual and features art on the wall from local artists.  The prices are moderate, especially considering portion sizes.  There is something for everyone on the menu too... and it's worth noting that Otro opens on Saturdays and Sundays at 8am for breakfast.  They get their coffee from Lux as well!

Way too overcrowded, no where to sit (in parents lounge), extremely noisy, kids screaming, crying, parents sitting on the ground. My daughters were hit/pushed at least 3-4 times where I had to step in and ""talk to"" the other kid (again result of overcrowding  parents or staff can't always have eyes on kids). Right now with the popularity, this is not a place parents come to relax while the kids go off to play supervised as it seems in the marketing materials. They've been open for 2 weeks so it's extremely popular, I do get it, but the overcrowding detracted from the overall experience of the mega playground. Would recommend putting a limit on the number of people they admit at a time, or sell advance reservations, maybe time slots. The owner & staff are extremely nice though and the reason why I will try again in a few months or on a weekday as I do believe it could be an enjoyable place to come, it's just the overcrowding that made it not so pleasant. Will review again after another visit though if things have changed.",2016-03-07 08:22:40

UqreJQG7RHAS4DXYoxJXew,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,yzmvsG3Vo-2_F3_0wHzJdA,4,11,5,9,"Originally opened in 1992 in Jacksonville Florida and described as ""Where the Locals Eat"" ever since, it was entirely by accident that it was discovered that Metro Diner had recently expanded to the Las Vegas Suburbs, ongoing discussion about who was doing a 'true' Monte Cristo Sandwich in the local market bringing up results for a familiar name just a few minutes away that had not been there just last month.

Not to be mistaken for Metro Pizza, though both they and the Diner chain now with nearly two-dozen locations show a similar commitment to Scratch-made classics invigorated by contemporary techniques and great ingredients, it was just past 8:15am on Saturday that a party of three entered the converted former drive-thru Burger joint now decorated as a cozy space with checkered floors and green tables, a few televisions showing Sportscenter as early 2010's Pop hits flittered overhead.

Arriving before most of the crowd and greeted by local Operating Partner Tony Alonge, whose name had been passed along from corporate after an E-mail inquiring as to whether the Monte Cristo was available at Breakfast since the online menu seems to indicate otherwise, it was at a sizable four-top next to the kitchen that seating was offered and menus presented, the servers with an ever-present smile that almost seemed contagious throughout the morning - a few of them even passing their limited free time dancing and singing along to the music.

Featuring a sizable menu, though not the outlandish 'everything to everyone' mishmash of some, it was after some perusal and questions about sourcing that a relatively sizable order was placed including a few half-size plates allowed in order to sample more variety, the total cost of just over $70 still a bargain considering all that was entailed and easily a place where a check less than $15 per person would be realistic as an average.

Honing recipes now for nearly 25 years, each restaurant offering similar classics plus several specials that change from week to week, it was with Coffee and Water poured and kept filled that the meal quickly got underway, a miscommunication about wanting items sent out in rounds soon seeing the whole table flooded with eight plates that made it difficult to taste everything while still warm, the Pound Cake French Toast, for instance, saved till last and at that point just above room temperature which made it difficult to get a sense of how good it might have been piping hot and more capable of melting the butter.

Moving on to items better assessed hot from the kitchen, a one-and-one Benedict featuring housemade Hollandaise, Canadian Bacon and Vegetables beneath medium-poached Eggs atop toasted English Muffins as good as most in the city alongside nicely fried Hash Browns, Metro Diner's Fried Chicken and Waffles proved very impressive considering the price point, a half-order of the bone-in Bird plump and juicy with a good spice profile served with supple Waffles and a scoop of Strawberry Butter.

Not offering the option for Pure Maple Syrup, but instead creating their 'signature' sweet and spicy Sauce tableside by combining Crystal Hot Sauce with Warm 'syrup,' it was with good fortune that neither the aforementioned Pound Cake nor the signature ""Yo Hala on The Square"" Stuffed French Toast required any additional garnishment, the thick slices of Challah Bread stuffed with Strawberries and Cream Cheese making for one tasty weekly special beneath a liberal ladle of warm Strawberry Compote.

Not particularly impressed by the ""Cheesiest Grits,"" even the addition of a layer of Cheddar both top and bottom leaving the grains a bit runny and flavorless without adding salt, Metro Diner's Buttermilk Biscuits feature the drop-style common throughout most of Florida and are well flavored with light sours of Buttermilk, the addition of a Honey-Glazed Chicken Plank to make a $4.79 Sandwich well worth it for those not wanting to invest in the whole Chicken and Waffles plate.

Speaking finally on the Monte Cristo, most versions in town either outright lying by serving a French Toast Sandwich or bastardizing the original recipe by omitting the Turkey, Metro Diner finally gives Las Vegas what so many have been requesting for years, the soft Sourdough Batter-dipped and deep-fried around a thick stack of two deli-Meats, Cheddar and American Cheese with almost no residual oil plus a big bowl of Raspberry Preserves at its side.

Using the same light Batter to coat the Onion Rings as that on the Monte Cristo, it was with compelling words offered by the chalkboard at the back of the room that Dessert became necessary, the Salty Caramel Brownie served warm with a big ball of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Chocolate drizzle while the Key Lime Pie is imported straight from Jacksonville for the sake of consistency, anyone familiar with the debate certain to be amused by Whipped Cream offered on the side, but certainly not on top of, the generous and tangy slice.",2017-03-27 10:56:06

I've been trying to find an Android phone and my first inclination was to go to T-Mobile since I already had a no-contract phone with them. I wandered into the store last week and talked to a gentleman there who tried to sell me the $79.99 plan (right now, my plan is $39.99.) I didn't want to double my plan just to get some interwebs, so I left.

After a little more research, I found out that T-Mobile actually has cheaper interwebs plans for no-contract phones, which this guy totally neglected to tell me about. He was pretty adamant about getting me into a contract so I could get the $99 price for a phone I was looking at (which, by the way, is FREE if you order online!) 

So, I came into the store this morning as soon as it opened and was greeted by Cynthia, who is the absolute coolest cell phone salesperson I have ever met. She asked what I wanted, I told her, she found it, and she added my $10 data plan and switched my cards (sim and memory) to my new phone, all the while chatting with me about nail salons and Starbucks (and phones, of course.)

This visit I opted for the two-piece buttermilk chicken fingers (with buttermilk ranch dipping sauce) and, of course, the mac and cheese.

The chicken was so hot and soft and tender with a delicious batter.  The ranch sauce was perfect, and added a whole ton of depth to the chicken.  And the mac and cheese...amazing.  Covered in delicious bread crumbs, it was spicy and tangy and cheesy and awesome.  I'm in love.

For a Sushi lover, I have eaten and visited a lot of Sushi establishments in different states and here at home. The food is good but the service lacked. When we arrived the reception from the staff was very strained. It's as if sating ""hello"" or ""welcome"" was too much work for them. 
We were sat by the server and each of us were given menus. Since it was our first time, we were reading, very carefully the menu so we can make good decisions in what to eat. Server came to take our orders more than once. I told her we needed more time but she kept coming back really fast without allowing us to have time to decide. We felt rushed. 
After we ordered and our food delivered, you'd think that they will come back to check up on us and see if we needed our glasses re-filled with our beverages. No one did that. I was parched and I had to get someone's attention to get my glass of water refilled. Could it be that I only had water and not Soda or an alcoholic beverage? Whatever the reason, I feel that I shouldn't have to flag someone that many times to get my glass of beverage refilled. 
The food was good but I've eaten better in other establishments that are cheaper who also gave us better service than they. 
The place is simply not friendly and welcoming.

My fiancÃ© saw this place and wanted to try it, but we found it out was closed on the weekends. =( My craving for a tasty sandwich/panini lead me to this place finally! I left work early so that I could beat the lunch rush and I definitely beat it. 

I decided to get the Chicken Sandwich (chicken, mixed greens, bacon, tomato, cheddar cheese and pesto) on a panini minus the bacon. The sandwich itself is pretty large which was surprising, because in the pictures it looked smaller. The sandwich was very flavorful and chicken was white meat (my favorite) and tender! All the ingredients paired up perfectly. 

My addiction to chocolate croissants also had me running to this place. Yes, I ordered the pain au chocolat....two of them actually. Although this is not on my diet plan, I had to get them. The crust is very flaky but buttery at the same time. It was pretty dang delicious!

My husband and I stopped by for a quick snack during a break from work. They run lunch specials before 3pm and we got there by 2:45pm. We shared the veggie combo and maybe that is where we went wrong.

When the female server (who is usually there) dropped the dish off she said, ""You got servings for two. The new guy is still getting used to our portions. It's no problem."" Cool. 

Well, once we were finished we got the bill and we were charged the dinner price. The time was only 3:20pm. Yes, we scarfed it down...we bring a whole new meaning to fast food. Anyway, my husband asked her about it and she insisted we arrived after 3pm. I know it was only a matter of $5 or so, but to me it was the ""customer is wrong"" attitude. We paid for the dinner price, but left feeling as though it was a bit passive aggressive to charge us more when we did not arrive after 3pm.

I have eaten similar dishes in other eateries without questions, but here the service is so genuinely nice and approachable that i had to ask if there was a particular way of eating the dish.

Tried the Frankathenpolis which was a super long name. What felt like a tongue twister I placed my order as ""the Franka dog"". It is advertised as a gourmet hotdog but if you take out all the unique toppings that they give you the hot dog itself tasted just like any regular street dog

For $7 the hot dog that I ordered came with feta cheese, tomatoes, green olives, diced red + green peppers, olive oil, lemon juice, and my choice of other toppings. I ended up adding hickory sticks, corn, and celery + carrot sticks as well. Yes it's a weird combination but after all it's the Frankathenopolis so may as well go big or go home. You can think of it as a greek fusion hot dog.

There were around 10 types of sauces to choose from. The labels on the bottles were rubbing off so it was somewhat difficult to determine what each of the sauces were. Thankfully the service was great and they were patient with me deciding which sauce to choose from. In the end I settled with mayo and some kind of honey mustard :)

Overall I felt that the meat tasted standard and it was small, but in combination with those toppings I would say it tasted pretty good. It was served in a red plastic basket lined with a sheet of paper that says Fancy Franks. Inside the place is pretty clean. In terms of the seats there are some window seats facing Queen St. W so 
it is always hustling and bustling with people and streetcars. The taste was average and not bad but the hotdog meat could be better. Overall I would say the hotdog itself = 2.5/5 but with the toppings it is 3/5",2017-04-30 16:18:06

There was a nice amount of shaved ice, kiwi, banana, strawberry, boba, mango, watermelon, and the mochi bits. I loved the mochi bits, they were the perfect size!

The burger was cooked perfectly! I mean, I don't know how bison is usually made but it tasted great so I'm assuming it was cooked well. It was spicy and savory! I strongly recommend it. 

I also got some of the Parnassian truffle fries. They were really good but I wouldn't recommend eating a while order by yourself. They are full of flavor and it can be easy to go a little over board with them. But the regular fries were equally delicious! Very brown and very crispy just like I like them! 

I thought I might as well try a shake while I'm here and boy am I glad I did! I got the pretzel and Nutella shake by recommendation of our server. She did not let me down at all! The shake was pretty thin and easy to drink and was topped off with pretzel chunks. Needless to say it was amazing!!! 

Only gripe was that when I walked in I was really unsure of what to do. Took me a few minutes to figure out that I needed to order at the counter. But now I know :)",2016-06-11 22:14:41

Let me start by saying that this place puts other Chinese takeout spots to shame on so many levels. I'll try to name them all:

1. It is nice, bright, and super clean.
2. It has a real wooden table with real wooden chairs AND a nice little sushi bar for those who choose to eat in. Those who have attempted to ""eat in"" at your typical Chinese carryout place will know why this is mentioned.
3. Staff is friendly.
4. Non-canned vegetables are used in their dishes.
5. The chicken was much more high-quality than the norm at such places.

We shared 2 sushi rolls, a dumpling appetizer and the garlic chicken. Food was well prepared and came out fairly quickly. Everything was very good, with the sushi being a pleasant surprise.

If we're in the area, we'd definitely eat here again.",2016-05-19 12:47:05

I've been there several times before and I actually enjoyed it more this time around. Looked up on my phone for the best eats on the strip and Deluca's came up as a must. Most, if not all reviews on Yelp are positive. There was a line out the door at about 1PM on a Saturday, but we only waited about 30 mins. I ordered the Mixed Grill breakfast (supposedly Bruce Willis' favorite) with steak. I expected it to be greasy, and it was. No problem there. However, the steak was dry, overcooked, and the whole meal was bland. I still finished it, but I was expecting better. Maybe I should've tried something else???

Though in my defense, I'd been fighting a cold all week, and when I landed into Vegas that Saturday afternoon for a work conference, the last thing I wanted to do is spend time in a noisy casino. So my partner and I decided to hightail it to the nearest theater, where we could digest our ridiculously giant dinners (thanks, Wicked Spoon) in relative quiet. 

First, this theater is super hard to find. If it weren't for the little sign in the alleyway, I never would have noticed it was there. The practically hidden location could partially be to blame for how abandoned-looking this theater is. (Well, that, and that there are a metric bajillion other things more interesting to do within a 1 mile radius). For our 10pm showing of an opening-weekend horror movie (Mama), there were *maybe* 15 people in the theater. Practically empty. Floors were sticky, seats were small, popcorn was stale, and employees were bored-looking and pretty lethargic. This theater is in dire need of an update. 

If I were a local, I definitely would not come back to this theater. If you're not too picky and need a respite from the more ""traditional"" activities Vegas has to offer, then it's definitely fine in a pinch.",2013-01-28 04:36:42

Since they're freshly made, they're still yummy and ""gooey"" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)

I got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben's rice, the steak we got seemed ""boiled"", the medium salsa wasn't as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the TapatÃ­o), although the salsa was flavorful.

It's interesting how King's is Eat N Park's opposite number, it's Bizarro-world counterpart if you will.

EnP has the Smiley cookie. King's answers it with the brilliant and rebellious (well, for a family chain anyway) Frownie. 

EnP has the Superburger. King's has the K-Boy.

Yeah, I know. It sounds like the name of a rapper or club DJ. 

And it's exactly like the Superburger in almost every way. You get those moist, grey patties that taste better than their looks would have you think. They are both double-deckers. Each has its ""special sauce"" along with the shredded lettuce, the tomato, the diner-borne chutzpah.

However can ya get a fried egg on your Superburger?

""Ah-hahhh"" says Hartley King, the company's larger-than-life founder and frontman. 

So we'll call it a 4 star draw. The Superburger and the K-Boy both go to the 1-hour time limit in their dream match.

The patio was perfect for a March evening, and wasn't loud like I thought it would be for being on a busy street. We all started with cocktails and I ordered the sloe burn (I love bourbon/whiskey) - it was really good. Very complex flavors and a little spice at the end. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of anything in the whiskey category.

We each ordered a steamed bun and I had the Peking duck - the bun is a little more taco-esque than your typical steam bun, but the meat was tender and the sauce that came with it is awesome. My husband had the catfish and it was my favorite. The pineapple tartar sauce on it is awesome. 

We all ended up getting noodles for our main dishes. I got the pork ramen. I am a novice ramen connoisseur but do enjoy a good bowl of ramen - it was very good. The kicker is that it's topped with the sexiest slow poached egg I've ever seen in my life, just oozy and silky perfect with the broth and the pork. The kale in the ramen didn't really work for me, it had an acidic taste to it that I wasn't in to, but the noodles were cooked well and the pork/bacon was delicious. The broth was nice, not super heavy. I tried the curry that my husband got and it was awesome - great spicy flavor with coconut and peppers. Those udon noodles were on point.

I am always on the hunt for farm fresh, healthy food. I find that the west valley is seriously lacking in this type of cuisine. I think it is a great idea to bring this here, and if it was done right, it would be successful. For example, Paradise and Jasons deli are always packed. Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well. 
I think Field Kitchen would have done a lot better if it was opened in its own location, and not taking out a crowd favorite of Sweet tomatoes. There are many loyal sweet tomatoes customers who are upset about the change. Try this in an empty building, don't take peoples favorite thing away. This building was not designed for their new concept and just trying to fit it in the cheapest way possible. The flow and feel of a restaurant is very important. It sets the whole foundation for the experience. The flow here is off like many reviewers have pointed out. What was a good idea, had poor execution. 
Anyways, we went to this on the opening day. I was excited but wary because of the change and the increase in prices. Again, I would have been a lot more excited if it wasnt at the expense of the normal sweet tomatoes and at a separate place. But being the food adventurer and wanting something healthy, we wanted to give it a shot. The first thing my husband noticed was the change of staff. There were a lot of hipster young kids. I am not sure where they came from, maybe somewhere in the east valley. I guess they are trying to market towards a younger edgier crowd than the traditional patrons. We went through the same spiel as the others when we sat down. It was a confusing concept but we got it. I am not a fan of confusing concepts but they dont break it for me. For example, I still love Paradise even though the different stations are a little confusing too but maybe because I was introduced to Panera first and they have a better flow. 
Anyways, my parents went first. My dad is hard of hearing, and I don't think he got it, and he got frustrated and just ended up with a bowl of chili and did not want to go back to get something else. So he was pretty hungry by the end. My mom ordered one of the gourmet salads. She was very disappointed. She ordered a chef salad, and there was barely anything on it. I think they missed half of the ingredients, and put some flaccid meat on it. It was a terrible looking sad face salad.
Next, we went up. I wanted to try one of their gourmet salads. The salad maker was so excited that I wanted to try one because not many people were, but then I asked if soup and stuff were included and was told No. Um, what? I am paying a premium price for this salad and I can't hit the soup bar? That is messed up to me, especially since you order in the same line. So I cancelled that, and got the soup and salad bar.
My salad was good. I can't think of any topping I was missing. I did miss the premade salads like the asiago cesear and coleslaws. I got the the dressing spinner, and picked out a dressing. I didnt like that the dressing went all over the bowl, I had some things that I did not want dressing on. It was annoying, and I mean seriously, paying someone to do that is a waste. 
Then,  I got to the 3 soup choices. I was thoroughly disappointed that I could have soup or macaroni and cheese.  
I also did not like that it wasn't all you can eat. Most salad bars are all you can eat. That is the appeal of having to make your own salad, so you can try different things. Jason's deli has a small salad bar, but its delicious and you can go back. What are they doing differently that Field Kitchen cant do? 
The bread station was good. I didnt taste any difference in the butters. It seemed like a marketing trick to think you are getting gourmet butter, but there is really nothing different or special.
We didn't bother with the yogurt. Our experience was just lacking that we wanted to get out of there.
Its sad. I think that it was a poor execution to try and get more money out of their customers and they took a crowd favorite out. Now we will never have a sweet tomatoes by us. 
We have gone to the metrocenter one a few times, but not to the extent we were frequenting the Arrowhead location. 

Will we be back? Probably not, I will just go to Jason's Deli, Paradise, or Wildflower.",2013-01-27 23:53:49

Everything's pink, that it almost feels like Barbie is the owner of the store and she just wanted everyone to know pink is the color of the ultimate diva! Their's a soda bar and booths, and tables and chairs, and it's a great family friendly atmosphere. During the days it attracts families and in the evening, couples, teens, and kids at heart! I like their changing flavors of the month board where you can take out either a pint of quart of their hand packed ice cream!

They offer shakes, floats, splits, and cones/bowls of ice cream! love it! And during the day there's also a food menu limited to sandwiches. One thing you'll notice when seated are the many frames of Family Circle comics. Bil Keane the comic strip writer is a big fan of Sugar Bowl and alot of his comics mention the place, so it's pretty cool a comic strip celebrates the awesomeness of this old town landmark.

These donuts are no joke. The cake donuts were crispy/crumbly on the outside and wonderfully soft and buttery on the inside. Like a perfect cake donut should be. The yeast-raised were airy and fluffy and squishy. I could have eaten at least a thousand. Like a perfect yeast-raised donut should be.

With that said on to the review.  I just thought this place was eh.  I started with the usual pot-stickers which were totally pre-frozen like I can get at the store and make at home.  -1 star

Next I got my Miso soup it was typical miso so nothing to cheer or talk bad about. 

Finally my two rolls came out.  I ordered both off the special rolls list.  First was the Dec. 29th roll.  I asked about why it was called that and my waitress seemed like I was the first to ever ask that and had no answer other than that's what it's always been called. -1 star.  It was ok decent flavor and decent presentation lots of rice.  

Last roll comes out and it's my baked CH3.  I learned why the 3 was in the name there were only 3 pieces for $8.95.  I was a bit disappointed then I took a bite.  It totally made up for it the baked Halibut and crab and avocado exploded goodness in my mouth and I was happy this was my finale.

The restaurant was empty, as hotel restaurants usually are, unless it's during the week when people go on business trips.
The decor was standard for a hotel restaurant.  Entering into the restaurant there was a beautiful French song about ""soixante neuf.""  Oh brother.

Anyway, this restaurant is part of summerlicious.  They apparently ran out of oysters for dinner (which was one of the choices for an appetizer), so I had a tomato soup (there was also the choice of salad), a steak, and a tiramisu.  The soup was ok, I tried some of the salad, and the dressing was amazing.

The waiter was great also, and he brought some very nice complimentary bread, with a great spread.

The steak was rib-eye, a great cut, was seasoned perfectly with sour cream, mashed potatoes, and vegetables.  The steak was on par with ruth's - it was amazing.  And the portions were huge.  

The tiramisu was also first-rate.  It was light, and beautifully presented - 3 ice cream scoops of it.

I think it would have been a great deal at $35, but it was only $25.  This was one of the best meals I've had in Toronto, and would definitely recommend coming here before summerlicious is up.

On a recent trip, we needed the baby to take a nice long car nap, so we hopped in the car and drove the 45 minutes to Chagrin Falls to get him to sleep (haha).

It's a cute coffee shop located in a plaza on Washington- they have drinks and also a small breakfast menu consisting of various pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and health bowls.

We got a simple pour over and an Inca tea- they informed us, for our tea, that the tea bag can be used twice (why don't all places tell you that!) and that they'll refill your cup a second time. I thought that was a nice gesture!

We ordered their avocado toast drizzled with honey, and it was delicious. Their breakfast tacos were also on point too. 

The coffee was good, I just prefer other roasters in the city more (duck rabbit, six shooter), but it is a nice option on the east side.

So, after seeing the waterfall in Chagrin Falls and you need a cup of coffee, definitely drop by Tame Rabbit!",2018-06-19 15:00:02

A FANTASTIC option for impressing visitors to Charlotte. AmÃ©lie's is great for a quick or small dessert after dinner and within walking distance from some of the best restaurants in Uptown.

The AmÃ©lie's brand has had a ton of success in the most recent decade, opening locations in the Caramel Commons and Park Rd neighborhoods. The key is the consistency in their premium treats. You can go to any AmÃ©lie's in the area and ask for the Salted Caramel Brownie and know you're about to have one of the best little morsels in the city no matter which location you're at. This location in particular has a LOT of spacious seating, especially for an uptown location. On the right side of the restaurant you can sit and watch pastries being made behind the huge glass window revealing the entire kitchen, and at the same time people-watch the hustle and bustle of College Street.

The decor is as unique as it gets. They got a thing for unusual chandeliers (ex. they made one out of stainless steel kitchen utensils). The interior design really is a must-see. Facilities are always clean from the tables to the floors, and the staff is friendly and very patient (which is a godsend, even as a seasoned AmÃ©lie's patron, I'll sometimes zone out just looking at all the delicious options in the display case).

My recommendation? Give the Dark Chocolate Raspberry Tart a try. You get a nice sized pastry with a rich chocolate ganache piping outlining the sweet fruit filling, on a firm yet flaky pastry pie tart. Also ask the counter staff what their seasonal treats are at the time. They typically have 1 or 2 seasonal Macarons in the case, all which have a perfect crispy wafer texture and incredible fillings.

Found this page and they're closed? No worries, their NoDa location (the original) is open 24/7 and just 10 min outside Uptown; just go 3 blocks to S Davidson, and 2.5mi north, you'll see the store right after Free Range Brewing.

Whatever your sweet tooth craves, you'll surely find something here! I really tried to think of something to critique, but couldn't think of anything valid enough to note... maybe offer free all-day parking? Yeah, get on that, then it'll be perfect!",2017-08-08 02:36:22

The waiter was nice enough to bring us both the English toffee caramel sauce and peanut butter sauce when we asked for both since we could not decide which one was better.

I did like the food, but everything on the menu looked quite expensive for lunch, I didn't really see any lunch specials and there was a lack of vegetarian options. There were vegetarian dishes, but it was severely limited, so you'd be stuck with whatever they offer on that option rather than having anything to pick from. The restaurant is very focused on meat, all four salads on the menu contained a heavy amount of meat. If they could improve their menus, I think I'd give it a better rating. Also, I was looking forward to trying some new advertised dishes on a Kelsey's promo that I got in the mail, but almost none of those items were available at this location, so I was disappointed because I already knew what I wanted to order thinking they'd have it.

So originally was really excited to try this place. Had seen a lot of the pictures of the breakfast food and read some reviews. We were enjoying football Sunday and New Year's Day so we weren't in the mood to cook and thought it would be the perfect time to try this place.

Ordered over the phone, got a fit and focused veggie delite omelette with no mushroom. 

Husband ordered corned beef hash breakfast 

He went to pick it up, they showed him both things and the girl even read everything back and everything sounded correct, she even mentioned the no mushrooms . Husband saw no mushrooms on the omelette as well. We timed it perfectly so that husband got back right after halftime and when I went to take first bite it was filled with mushroom, tried to take them out but it was just a mess after that. 

Called them to complain , they were super busy which is understandable . I remember the manager asking if they showed it to us. Like yes but we didn't have a fork to open up the food and check inside . 

He asked what register it was rung up on and how we paid and said there might be two charges shown due to the fact that he would be doing a charge back or something for the cost of the food without the veggie omelette .  However nothing showed up. We were never comped . And the day of we didn't have them remake it because my husband didn't want to leave again during the game to go get it ... and they were so busy I don't think they wanted to remake it anyways. 

My husband and I shared his and mine was thrown away and we were both left unsatisfied.

A group of 8 of us are all eager to try anything and wanted to finally try these new ""escape"" type of rooms together. This is anything BUT those ghetto escape rooms that is just 4-walls and combo locks ... THIS has some HIGH Tech stuff here. 

Atmosphere: Firstly, let's just say that i was a little surprised how big this place was. First when we entered, it looked like such a small little stairwell -- but I didn't expect that we would enter such a large ""lounge"" type area. It had the full counter for ordering food and paying for the escape room. it really just looked like a board game lounge. 
This place is a combo of BOARD games and ESCAPE rooms.  Very clean place and large area to play board games while the escape room was separated in another section where the employees have to walk you to the entrance of each room. 

Games : We didn't stick around to play board games after our escape rooms. So this review will be based on the escape room that my friends and I participated in. it was the ""easy room"" Doll house or something. Little did we expect it to have so many electrical / high tech things in the room. It was suspenseful and tough to solve and sadly we had to keep asking for clues. We were just not good as escape room things and plus , i think we were freaking ourselves out in the room. Normally, I'm not usually scared of things, but I was in the room with my fellow girlfriends who influenced me to be a little more scared!

Food: As we sat down to wait for our 2 rooms to be ready (group of 8 and we split up to have one scarier room and one normal room --- LUCKY we got the scary one), we were served with the japanese popcorn!! It was delicious -- It was sweet and salty like kettlecooked popcorn and topped with those sesame and seaweed. (Sorry, I later  tried this at home with a bag of kettle cooked popcorn and bought rice seasoning and made this to eat as well!! SO YUMMYS).

Even if it appears to be absurd, like a Sunday paper. The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.

It is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.

Back to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!

There was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.

I ordered the Bruleed French Toast and he ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs, scrambled/well, with potatoes, toast, and bacon (meat is extra). We planned to share so we could have a little of everything. I was surprised that they brought out the complimentary bread before our brunch, but it was almost lunchtime. I sure do enjoy the honey oat bread. Sourdough is alright too.
When our food came out, I took a bite of the French toast and was instantly turned off by the mushy consistency. It's so thick and, I'm sure, soaked in egg. It was not appetizing to me. My boyfriend offered to switch plates since he'd had it before and liked it, so we did. The eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them. Most of the potatoes were crunchy, so I was not impressed. The bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy. I don't know if that means it is extra lean?? The toast was really not necessary after all the bread I had just eaten...
Overall I was not pleased with this meal, especially for the price! And I had a stomach ache afterwards. There are so many other places I'd prefer to get breakfast food. Our server did not really have a sense of humor either.
We did get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, for good measure. Vanilla Bean and Lemon Meringue. Unfortunately the meringue had melted off the top by the time we got it home... The vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream. So it was good, but even half a slice was too much. The lemon meringue was rather tart but the whipped cream helped to balance it out.

VwDvRztP3NApUnpzfwVClQ,-RCD8F7qbsLfzT3k1HtMxg,wJK311GrpDS9KSaPdz27hQ,5,2,0,0,"I absolutely love this park!  A wonderful neighbourhood gem that welcomes  people of all ages including the four legged friends.

I've been coming to Trinity Bellwoods since I was a teenager because I was an avid tennis player and spent many weekends at the outdoor tennis courts.  I wasn't quite the professional tennis player, but amongst friends and family, it was easy to pretend I was a good player, plus not having to pay for court time was a bonus.

As an adult, I don't play tennis anymore, but I like to run or walk through the park as a shortcut to the other side because it's very scenic and pretty in all seasons. Plus the loop surrounding the dog park is great for coaching a beginner runner which I have done last fall. 

In addition, I love doing yoga in the park and having picnics with friends in the summer.  There's even a farmer's market when the weather is warm and plenty of events going on practically every weekend during the spring and summer. Plus the leaves changing in the fall is absolutely a pretty sight for the eyes.

Although, the park tends to get extremely busy and often rowdy at times especially during warmer weather, it's still an amazing park filled with a plethora of various interesting people.  One can easily spend the day people watching and admiring the various stylish outfits or lack of clothing at times.  Be prepared for an eclectic exposure beyond your eyes can imagine and be ready to divert the eyes of the little ones.

The park is massive for being within the city with two baseball diamonds, a hockey rink, eight tennis courts, kids playground, a wading pool and a large off-leash dog park at the centre of the park.  Also, there's a Community Centre within the park which consists of a swimming pool, kiddie pool, basketball court, ping pong tables, kids free play time and they also offer various programs for all ages through the Parks and Recreation run by the city.

Recently, I've been dog sitting for a friend away on vacation and have been coming to the park quite frequently.  I don't venture into the mud pit (i.e. off-leash dog area) because my dog charge is not great with other dogs since he's just happy being outdoors strolling through the park and wagging his fluffy tail.

With the weather warming up, most of the snow and ice has melted, and the mud pit is now like a mini pond, so pretty soon it'll dry up and hopefully be filled with some greenery and flowers.   We had a pretty bad winter and without the sunshine, the place can look pretty dreary, but it's still a great place for the four legged friends to roam around freely and the backdrop of the city skyline does look very beautiful throughout the day/evening.

I cannot wait for the spring and summer so we can all enjoy the park to the full extent.  Who doesn't like a good picnic in the park? Plus wine in tetra packaging is totally acceptable and probably the only time you can appreciate not having a bottle to lug around.

Overall, Trinity Bellwoods Park is definitely an oasis within the city filled with great energy by everyone who visits or walks through the park.  Plus location is close to the many bakeries and restaurants which makes for an easy stop to pickup goodies and food to bring to the the park no matter what season.",2015-03-18 19:24:38

When we arrived our reserved table wasn't ready so we started off with a cocktail at the bar. I tried the Diablo, which was a tequila based beverage with a red color and a pretty good flavour overall. We were shortly moved into our table, and we got to begin the fun of choosing what to eat and drink. 

We found a nice bottle of riesling for $50, and then started with orders of the house made baguette, prosciutto, warmed olives, and 60 day aged beef tartare with truffle sauce. This was my first time delving into the world of beef tartare, and to be honest I wasn't a fan until I wrapped a piece of prosciutto around it. The rest of the apps were good though, and an enjoyable start to our meal although not necessarily memorable.

On to the mains... I went with the Braised Lamb Shank in Pork Belly Hash, which was just next level awesomeness. We're talking food orgasm territory (orgaslamb?). Perfectly cooked and the flavours just complimented itself so well, this is definitely one of the best plates I've eaten in years. 
My dining companion ordered the Campagnolo Cassoulet, which was composed of duck confit and a spicy garlic sausage on a bean medley type thing. I was able to sample a bit and the duck was also top notch, and while the sausage had a homemade and heavily seasoned vibe it wasn't as good but still decent.
Only a couple options for dessert and neither spoke to us given how much food we had eaten already.

The ambience was nice and the servers were friendly and knowledgable, but my date pointed out something which I didn't think too much of at first, but had some truth to it that I thought more about as the meal went on. The servers were all rather casually dressed. The kitchen staff, the bartender, and the hostess were all dressed well. The actual servers were wearing denim jeans and flannel or cowboy styled collared shirts. Perhaps it is to keep the approachable and down to earth feeling rather than pretentious and elitist, but there is definitely some merit to the thought that when dropping a couple hundred on dinner bill, perhaps the servers shouldn't be more under dressed than the customers.

All in all, probably closer to 4.5 than 4 stars, and the Lamb Shank Pork Belly Hash was one of the best meals I've ever eaten, but it was not an overwhelming win throughout the whole experience, thus earning the 4.

Soooo 30 minutes into our room and our previous guest from Germany left behind some personal stuff, a lovely love note that we could only partially read and a bag he got from a convention and he took both the $4.00 water bottles, did I mention the bathroom had towels everywhere & a preview of what he ate before check out in the toilet.

I called guest services again since I really had to use the restroom and we did not want to leave for the night without our room being serviced.

Other than the view, the only thing that stinks is the parking--if you don't wanna pay for the lot on weekends, you gotta hunt and peck for a spot on the street, which can be hard to find at times...but anyway, if you're looking to grab a bite to eat before the show at the Plain Dealer Pavilion or whatever it's called these days, you won't go wrong at the Rock Bottom.",2008-05-02 00:21:43

Prior to heading over there, I checked my trusty Yelp, and liked what I saw. I read that it was in some random former bank, but it was not until we arrived at The Vig, did I realize that it was the bank my Dad used to take me as a kid. Waves of positive nostalgia washed over me, this place used to send balloons to kids in cars at the drive thru, and they had a huge Kachina doll there. Weird how memories take you back.

Anyway, arriving Sunday night at around 7, the sign informed us to seat ourselves, and we found a great booth near the bar. I was curious to see how they would notice new people arrived, and out of no where, a friendly server showed up. Drinks were ordered, and we took in the venue. As others have described, The Vig Uptown, is remarkably cozy, warm, and urban.I have to confess I love when reuse happens to old buildings. Rather than bulldoze a bank, turn it into a restaurant. Well done, Vig.

Drinks arrived, and they were super tasty. My sis doesn't drink (don't judge, every family has a black sheep) but our great server, Michelle, recommended a great drink that didn't contain booze, which my sis loved.

The food was amazing, and we even ordered dessert, which was unreal. A brownie sundae sounds simple, and it is, but the execution was outstanding. It was sooo tasty, I highly recommend it.

My only recommendation would be that they provide a non-valet parking option. I don't know of other places where there isn't an option to park elsewhere, or on your own. Maybe if I had an impressive car, I would be all about it, but I drive an Xterra, which isn't exactly flush, although I pretend it is a Cayanne.  A boy can dream.

Overall, this place is really, really well done. The service, food, and venue are just so well executed, I truly can't wait for the next chance to go there.",2010-10-08 04:47:34

The other thing that is still true is that service sucks in the majority of your casual dining places. 

Though the bartender isn't professionally trained. She had a nice personality which was a nice and welcomed change. Took her awhile to find the southern comfort, tisk tisk. Made the most god awful vodak collins I have ever come across that I returned it to her.

The wings were good but not tossed in Sauce, they give you a dipping bowl. Different but forunately the wings could stand alone.

I understand they have only been open a week or two, so I was patient when service wasn't the most attentive.  Like when one of us ordered a beer that was on tap and the waitress goes ""Huh? I've never heard of that?"" and he had to point it out on her ""Beers on Tap"" cheat sheet she was carrying around.  The men liked the choices of beer, and the Guinness pour was above average with the shamrock detail on top.  They had a wine list, which was a pleasant surprise for me.  We didn't order food.

The space is open with a long bar, long row of tables, and a couple high tables near the front for large groups.  I don't get the bear skeleton in the front.  Just seemed weird.

Now, for the annoying part.  We arrived at around 3:30pm and stayed until 6:30ish......and were asked to cash out our check TWO separate times, meaning we would have THREE different waitresses.  Huh?  Why?  Unfortunately for Murphy's Law, being asked to cash out a second time was all we needed to get us out the door and to El Zocolo for some food.

I've been curious about this place for a while, and their Summerlicious menu looked tasty and was getting good reviews, so made a last minute reservation on this weekend.
The place is quaint, has a nice back patio which we enjoyed, has a decent variety of craft beer on tap, and $8 5oz glasses of wine. This all bodes well regardless of what we ate.
But that said, the food was most excellent. The ribs with mac & cheese was indeed one of the best main dishes I've eaten in a while regardless of venue or reason (summerlicious or regular menus), with a perfect balance of complimentary flavours and perfectly cooked food.

Le Cue features about 10+ tables, 2 foosball tables and a couple of booths to chill in. Friday and weekend nights are packed with twenty something year olds having a good time, but weekdays and daytime there's usually only a few tables going and one of the pros is that the place is spacious so you don't feel packed or crowded. Even at max capacity, you are still able to move around without a problem and it's not claustrophobic. Another point is that the venue is clean and well kept. The vibe is also very chill and fun. 
Service is pretty good. They are always nice and helpful when you need it. I can't really comment on the food because I have not tried it but we have ordered drinks and no complaints there. They also serve free water as well.

Someone else at our table had the pork chop and was very pleased. We all opted for dessert as well. My creme brÃ»lÃ©e was wonderful and I appreciated the addition of some fresh strawberries, (instead of the usual raspberries) since they are in season. Everyone was very pleased with their meals.

We did have to inquire about our drinks because it just seemed to be taking a while and we didn't order any special cocktails.

If not the best sushi I have had, but given that is Uchi in Houston or Austin so that is not completely fair, it is still serviceable.  The atmosphere is great and modern looking without being stuffy or overly chic for no reason.  The patio area is one of the best downtown.

The spot is always packed, even on a Monday during the summer when all the U of I students are gone.  So service is a little swamped, but they will check on you when they get a chance and kitchen times are usually spot on.

A handful of micros on tap.  Various offerings from Oskar Blues, Dogfish Head, and Bells.  Sushi can be anywhere from very good to meh.  There has been enough inconsistency for me to not give this a full four star.  Sometimes they just over do it, and other times it might not be the freshest.

Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. 
Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!!

The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!

We really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the Middleton store.  Our mistake we ordered from here.  That's ok.  It was our mistake.

However, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout.  We ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes.  It gave us a time.  It actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas.  They were just putting them in the oven.  So we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate.

The pizza was fine.  It was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it.

As someone who loved the old school wood paneling, original furniture and supper club fare, it was a bit of a shock to step foot into the bright, mid century modern designed space with cool earth tones and new cream colored leather booths. 

The menu has undergone a considerable makeover (e.g. oysters and carpaccio) and we happened to dine during their Sunday Chicken and Champagne (mind blown), which is case in point that this is not your dad's Avenue Bar. 

Also the staff has been overhauled with the median age 25--they're all friendly and attentive, seemingly at home here or in an Eddie Bauer catalog. 

Cheese curds were ordered -- they're definitely bigger and seasoned differently than the old recipe but it's a flavorful upgrade that was approved by the table. Brandy old fashions were still well made with a strong pour and classic garnishes. 

The chefs kindly accommodated our request and made deep fried walleye (typically reserved only for Friday), which came with fries (average) and cole slaw (above average with a nice vinegar and sweet balance). The 4-piece fried chicken was light and crispy, the oil was definitely fresh. The side of green beans were also a bright spot, well
blanched and lightly oiled and salted, which complemented everyone's entree.

It's not horrible service, but you definitely get the feeling that they want you to hurry up and order so they can get back to dancing, goofing off and acting cool.  Its sad because I was very polite to her and found the lack of customer service quite annoying and unfair, now I'm not looking to be best friends with these people, but it would be nice to not get attitude, especially when you are being polite and friendly to them. 

My advice to them is, if you are too prideful, and think you're too cool for your job, give it up, quit and let someone that actually needs one and cares about being employed take your place. It's hard to want to return to a place where the people that make your food are annoyed because, they are making you food...

The Asian flavored sauce was delicious and laced with lemongrass as promised. My plate came with a generous amount of fresh steamed rice and tender crisp vegetables such as baby bok choy, broccoli and carrots. It was a delicious plate there is no reason why anyone wouldn't like it. Some people might point out that fish sauce sauce should be served with this plate.  Other sauces are available on the table.

My husband loves Oxtail so he ordered the Oxtail Pho. He said the clear broth was delicious. He thought it was really good and was spicy. As delicious as the broth was the dish wasn't perfect and not all of the three pieces of Oxtail were edible. He could only chew the meat off of the small piece the two bigger pieces weren't ready yet. But this is a newly opened restaurant and they are still finding their way.

The beef was good, and the sauce was very interesting. Our last dish was fish - really great flavor. Again, I didn't see the menu so I can't list the names of the dishes - sorry! :(

I did feel the portions were a little small for the price, but I do realize that the ingredients are probably expensive to purchase in Phoenix, so I can understand the justification for the price.

I would have given this restaurant 4 stars but I decided to only give 3. I love Yelp, and I depend on reviews, good and bad, to help guide my decisions. I do agree that the customer is not always right, but I think the high and low ratings for this restaurant are fair because everyone has a different experience, palate, expectations, etc. I'm fine with the owner defending the restaurant against poor reviews, but many of his replies mock the customer, contain rude language, and just leave a bad impression. I think both owners and customers have a duty to treat one another with respect, which I don't see here.

I am all for supporting local businesses, and I would love to come back, but I'm honestly not sure I will. I am curious to see what scathing reply the owner will leave to this review (if any).",2013-08-03 22:48:50

And we both just totally forgot what it is was called. The show, obviously, wasn't really all that memorable. The second time I saw it, I still enjoyed all the acrobats but the side show attempt in comedy was still poor in my opinion.

Talk about stepping back in time.  The place looks really old, but that's because it is.  It's apparently kind of a historical landmark.

The casino and public areas were clean and maintained, but it was a bit smokey.  Quite a few people were playing slots and the table games.  We sat down at a roulette table to play awhile.  Unfortunately, the dealer apparently spoke and understood little English.  It was difficult to get her to understand what we were asking or wanting.  The cocktail waitress came around frequently and kept us from getting too thirsty!  

There was some kind of construction or re-modeling going on in the back of the casino....maybe to the coffee shop...I couldn't tell.  

You sort of get the feeling that you're in a shady part of town when you're at El Cortez, but there were security guards all around and everything was fine.

It was nice to see that they had great pescetarian and vegan options which gave me a multitude of options. I decided on the lunch special of honey walnut shrimp and fried rice. It comes with your choice of egg roll, soup or salad for a little under $10. I waited for about 10 mins for my order and headed back to work.

Presentation:
I wasn't impressed. There was literally two scoops of rice (as if they'd used an ice cream scooper) that had no veggies whatsoever. My honey walnut shrimp(5 medium sized pieces) lay atop a small bed if coleslaw???strange (of all the foods you can lay shrimp on) there was also about 6 walnuts as well.

The dish not only lacked color and presentation but flavor sadly. The worst part of all is I actually caught myself saying in my mind (of course) that even Panda Express tasted better!

Not what I'm used to when going for weekend brunch in Toronto. Even so, we had to wait 30 minutes for our food because they had a large table. They're not set up to accommodate a large crowd in the kitchen (even though they have the seating for it). 

We asked if we could get the fruit that came with our meal while we waited the 35 minutes for our poached eggs to arrive, and the waiter assured us he'd bring something out for us. Nope! He definitely didn't bring anything to tide our hunger over; even the fruit that is supposed to come with our meal. After about half an hour, out popped our stale-looking breakfasts on hot plates. 

Once the food arrived it was quite mediocre. The cod cakes on my Newfoundland Breakfast were good but for some reason the entire meal was nauseating. Not sure if the hollandaise was off or something. My friend noticed the poached eggs were too watery.

One of the servers seemed quite inexperienced. The other was friendly and promised to bring our fruit out (and didn't). Not the best service, waitstaff or kitchen.

One of the worst brunches I've ever had. My friend and I both felt nauseous afterwards even though we had different breakfasts. Only items in common were the fruit (which seemed fine), the eggs, and the hollandaise.",2011-11-30 23:31:50

A BYOB located in a rather blue collar part of town the restaurant may seem an odd choice to the unfamiliar-everything about its location, size, and layout seems to say ""locals only."" What those paying attention would realize, however, is that Chef Douglas Dick has twice been a Beard Award Semi-Finalist, thrice been named Pittsburgh Magazine's Chef of the Year, and has been embracing the ""Farm to Table"" movement since before most had American's even heard of it.  Locally sourced foods prepared by an internationally educated chef and a menu that changes daily (because Dick goes to the market daily for his products) everything about Bona Terra sounded fantastic.

Given our large lunch and long drive ahead it was decided that we would share a couple of small appetizer plates prior to our mains - and given the fact that neither appetizer required cooking they would arrive quite quickly after our amuse.  Starting first with a cheese plate, Cypress Grove Lamb Chopper with poached Bartlett Pears, Mixed Berry Infused Honey.  Brought forth by the same company who makes my favorite cheese of all time, Humboldt Fog, the Lamb Chopper was described as a sheep's milk Gouda imported from Holland.  Smooth as butter and fragrant without being pungent the fromage was accompanied by impossibly sweet pears, water crackers, local strawberries, and a clover honey blended with what tasted largely of blackberry.  A very well composed plate and a great cheese.

Following our appetizers would be a short delay-but a delay with the most unexpected treasure of the night...a bread and butter combo that still leaves me weak in the knees.  Served singly (thank goodness or I'd have invariably eaten ten,) and piping hot from a wooden basket were ""Brioche Rolls and Salted Peach Butter.""  Warm and buttery on their own the rollswould have been suitable without any topping - but paired with a peachy sweet mÃ©lange of butter and cream cheese, they were heavenly. All told I ate four...in retrospect I still wish I would have eaten ten.

For my sister's main - Oven Roasted North Atlantic Cod over Israeli Cous Cous and Sauteed Green Beans, Tarragon Infused Butter-Wine Pan Sauce with Grilled Black Mission Figs.  Having never seen fig meets fish on a single plate I was intrigued by this dish from the start and only moreso when it arrived.  A substantial slice of mild and buttery cod over a toothsome cous-cous and pan-crispy green beans, the fish was topped with a halved plump and juicy Fig clearly soaked in wine and butter while a sweet/savory reduction of butter, wine, and chopped figs circulated the plate.  While the plating, in my opinion, could have been dressed up I'm rather certain the flavoring and quality couldn't have been improved.

While my companions' dishes were good mine was unreal - and only improved from the menu listing when Chef Dick informed us that he'd just gotten in a lobe of foie gras and if it ""met his approval"" he'd like to add it to the dish.  Arriving with the smells of cinnamon, cherry, allspice, and thyme the ""chef suggests medium rare"" Seared Maple Leaf farms Duck breast and Hudson Valley Foie Gras over long grain Basmati rice, Sauteed Zucchini, Local Sour Cherry Compote, Sweet and Spicy Tropical Jamaican Jerk Reduction was fantastic.  Smooth and supple with a clean layer of fat ribboned beneath the crispy skin the duck was potentially the best quality duck meat I've ever had.  Topped with a velvet and ample slice of foie gras a presented over a benign rice and vegetal zucchini mÃ©lange the dish was brought to a peak by the addition of poached black cherries and a reduction that added heat and spice without overwhelming the multiple nuances of the dish.

After a meal so stunning dessert was a must - For my sister's selection she targeted the Bavarian Chocolate and Hazelnut Tart with Local Strawberries.  Served in a buttery crust similar to my mothers, Erika's tart would consist of a creamy whipped dark chocolate mousse loaded with what I can only describe as ""Chunky Hazelnut Butter.""  Something like a ""dark"" Nutella pie the simplisticy of the tart was matched only by its decadence.

For my dessert the decision was between cheesecake and the dish our server described as the ""house special."" With everything exceptionally special so far I went with the obvious - a simple and decidedly indulgent Rich Chocolate Cake with Peach Ice Cream.  Served almost like Keller's Bouchon dessert the thick, rich, and warm cake was topped with a large scoop of ice-cream that tasted like a melting peach without the fuzz.  Focusing on the cake-the texture was almost that of a steamed pudding-a little wet, but ""set"" and hefty.

Bona Terra was one of those experiences that makes you realize just how good largely unmanipulated fresh fruits, vegetables, and proteins can be when placed in the hands of a skilled chef.  Great food, wonderful service, and a nice location without all the hype and frills - a ""hidden gem.""",2010-07-07 23:46:50

I had the roasted onion soup which was terrific. Days later I still think about those croutons and the deep, rich broth that accompanied it. It was a little too salty but overall so much better than those other french onion soups that masquerade as the real thing.

The duck was also a big hit.  It was quite tender.  Add a little sausage and you had a nice balanced main dish.

The ""bananas foster"" was nothing like bananas foster, but a new take on it. I'm not even a bananas fan and I enjoyed it much.

I couldn't eat it. I also ordered the Wonton soup. My wife ordered the Beef Broccoli and there was hardly any beef in the Beef & Broccoli. She said the egg roll that came with the dinner tasted nasty so she did not eat it. 

This place serves just plain below average - average Chinese Food. As for quality,  sometimes well, you don't get what you pay for. Yet I was torn between giving it ""meh"" or ""A-OK"".  That's because their wonton soup is excellent.  So I rated the place 2 stars.",2013-05-28 23:57:06

Most of the other Korean places are a bit too expensive ~ Suri is $27 (more variety) and the Mother Korean is $25.  My wife loves Korean so we try to do it once a month.  If we went more often (esp to a buffet), I probably ballon into the Michelin man.

As for the restaurant, outside, it doesn't look too appealing.  In fact, it looks like a run down shack.  The inside is like a diner setup.  Kinda long and curves around the end.  However, it was kinda cozy.

As for the service, the 4x's that we have been there, we thought the service was pretty good (granted, all 4x's, we were with a large party).  They filled your drinks and got you a scissor, forks, and napkins pretty often.  Only issue that I had was that they only allow you one scissor per table.  Kinda sucks when you have to cut alot of Gabbi and Korean Ribs.  Otherwise, service was good.  By the way, one of the things that I do like is that they regularly change your grille when it needs changing.  

As for the food, dessert looks awful.  Don't go there.  There non-meat dishes are nothing to talk about.  However, you are at a Korean buffet; so, eating meat and seafood is the key.  Their meat selection and seafood are pretty good.  Actually, I think it is comparable to other Korean restaurants in town.  Each time, I usually focus on eating the shrimp and Korean BBQ ribs.  Oooh la la.  Granted, you don't get the selection of the other restaurants, but you do get your money's worth.  Also, by the time that you are done eating, you do feel like a stuff pig.  Oink!  I guess this is one of the reasons why we come here often.

At first, I was standing in front of the al pastor because the menu above says ""Express Line"" under each description, so I naturally stood where it said the express line for the al pastor was. Then an employee came over and told us to order with her at another area. They really need to put up the signs better because it's confusing. If I'd been here before I'd know, but being this was my first time, I had no idea and just went with what the menu said. 

The lady who took my order was very nice and the inside appeared clean. I have to say the salsa/veggie bar is larger here than at most places with more of a variety. Our food was to-go, so we stood near the supposed ""Express Line"" and waited for our order to be up. I thought it was strange that the whole time I was there the al pastor on the spit wasn't turned on. No spinning meat, just meat there on the spit. I also never saw anybody carve any meat off for the tacos I ordered. 

Al Pastor Taco ($2) - Just meat, tortilla and if you'd like they will add pineapple at no charge. This was just bad. I only took 2 bites and then couldn't eat anymore. Some of the al pastor was so badly charred and the parts that weren't had zero flavor. They don't even out onions and cilantro on them! I kinda thought that was crazy to be honest. The menu shows what the tacos look like and they have onions and cilantro on them. If the meat and tortilla were good enough, it wouldn't even need anything else, but this wasn't anything tasty and I'd bet money the corn tortillas on my tacos came from a grocery store and weren't made on site. 

""Ranchero Al Pastor Taco"" ($3.50) - This taco has al pastor, beans, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. The toppings saved me on this taco. While I only found one glob of melted cheese, the beans, sour cream and guacamole had good flavor. Those toppings helped me get the taco down thank goodness because that first taco just wasn't edible.

1. The food lacked flavor

Even if this was happening, for whatever reason, I don't think that it was right for the servers to leave the list out for us to see.

The nigiri they serve comes with a huge piece of fish.   While this is great for a value point of view it's not easy to eat.

Im the kinda of person who at the post office wants to limit all personal contact with any human being besides dropping off the package I'm trying to ship out or buying forever stamps (which you can now buy at other places beside the post office so i don't even come here for that anymore). But like I said Unusual Good experience here. 
Aftering seeing the 30+ person deep line on the day before X-Mas, I went to the self help weighing machine to pay for the flat rate boxes. After I thought I did everything right, I didn't know where to drop the box off. So I jumped to the front of the line and asked one of them employees Matt,and he said I paid for the wrong box amount.
Thanks to him, instead of asking me to wait in the inexcusable line that is the post office, he came out from behind the counter and walked me through the steps and in actuality I OVERPAID for the box. Unfortunately, he couldn't give me a refund nor use the credit to buy anything but whatever, I avoided what could have been easily a 30min-1hour visit to the post office and my friend got her Bday package on time.
Thanks to Matt, I spent a total of 7min in the post office on the day before Xmas.
THANK YOU MATT!!

1) Tip- Pick up prepaid flat rate boxes and envelopes before and PAY FOR THEM AT HOME and then just drop them off at the post office
2) Use the self help machine to pay for letters and packages so you can avoid the bad customer service at the post office that we all usually experience (just like at the DMV)

We also got the stewed beef ribs and bread. The bread tasted awesome with the sauce, and for some reason the beef had a taste of lamb with it. Not sure if this was intentional, or simply b/c they cook both meets in the same wok. Regardless I personally enjoyed the dish BUT for those who don't like lamb I may have to caution you against it.

(7) kinds of meats
(7) kinds of veggies
(7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked

Lively and entertaining for both kids and adults alike, and I defy you not to start singing along with at least a few of the songs playing overhead!

Our server greeted us quickly and was sure to forewarn us that they were having issues with the computer system so things were running a little more slowly than usual.  We weren't in a hurry so it was okay, and we appreciated the heads-up.  He was friendly and attentive.  One of the managers also greeted us warmly as we waited for our meals.  We were pleased with the service.  

This was my first time as a vegan patron and I was super happy to learn that their Veggie Burger is actually made with the vegan Boca patty...hooray!  So my dinner was a veggie burger, which wasn't the most delicious meal I've ever had, but sure beat having to order a plain side salad or tiny dish of steamed veggies.  My husband opted for dessert only, but his brownie and ice cream dish might as well have been a meal, it was humongous.  Our daughter's burger was good sized and she loved it.  Everything was to our liking, no complaints.

This isn't what I'd call a super intimate environment, not a whole lot of privacy and the tables are pretty packed together, but it's a fun, energetic vibe.  Many times they have clowns, stilt-walkers, or balloon artists wandering the floor to entertain the kiddos during dinner.  It's also pretty decent ""after hours"" when the adult environment takes over...good drinks, good music, a dance floor for those who really get to feelin' it...I've had some good times here.

mUJh4ivsqsKwsfSkbF34Uw,v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,5,3,4,4,"For years I had seen Baguette Cafe listed among various coffee shops(?) on the Yelp Las Vegas homepage list of ""Best Food in Las Vegas"", and I scoffed.  No doubt in my mind that Baguette probably had some fine sandwiches, quiches and the like, but I severely doubted that it was worth a trek from UNLV or my house in the Southeast to experience.  If I could turn back time to September of 2009 I would most certainly be Duke of this joint raising my Yelp cred.  Unfortunately I don't have time travel abilities and am stuck with a paltry 8 check-ins here and non-elite status for '16 which I wear with Scarlet Letter-like shame.  

The food here is really on point.   I especially am in love with most of the salads they offer.  In particular the Ham, Prosciutto and Tuna varieties just blow me away every time.   In perusing the reviews I saw a random 1 star review which made me pause, and saw the reviewer complaining about the length of time it took for his salad, and wondering why (I'm paraphrasing) ""it took so long to throw some meat and greens together"".   I, for one, am happy that it's not that simple for the staff here to lovingly put together what very well might be the best salads in Las Vegas that I've had.  I've actually stood, drink in hand, watching them prepare my salad-to-go order (yes, that's just as creepy as it sounds), and there's a lot of attention to detail and, dare I say, culinary love going into these.  All of the ingredients, from the meats, cheeses, veggies and herbs always taste fresh and no component seems out of place or unneeded.  

I can only put the highest of recommendations on those three salads, as I tried the chicken salad once, as well as the greek salad with chicken, and found the chicken to be bland in comparison to the other protein options.  

I haven't really delved into the sandwich options much as the salads demand my attention every time.  Preferring salads to sandwiches is something I would've once only thought a Bizarro version of myself would say.   That's the power of Baguette Cafe.",2016-04-11 23:38:31

Imagine what your Pho would bring to me
You know that I'm waiting patiently
Till you're in my side
Bo Bites days; Bo Bites nights
Eggrolls is the one I need can't you see
You know my belly is crying just for you
Fish Sauce I will always add it too
To be in my side
Bo Bites day and Bo Bites night
But I feel my belly is aching without you

Let's go to Pho Number One

Let's go to Pho Number One
To feed me all the way
No I'm never gonna leave you
You're always on my mind
and Pho Number One I'll visit all the time

Pho Number One is a very modern looking Vietnamese restaurant located in Mesa.  

Like most Vietnamese restaurants this one supplies plenty of Vietnamese cultural decor, but to my surprise also some modern Southwest art.  It has a couple of television screens playing some odd channel I didn't recognize, but who knows what dwells upon the millions of channels of Direct TV!

Carrying on, my group and I came for dinner.  I went for the Eggrolls to start and the Lemongrass beef Vermicelli noodles.  This is not my usual dish I would order in a place called Pho Number One, but it was freakin' hot out and I need something less soupy hot!  Overall, the eggrolls were perfect to the crunch with pork and vegetables.  The eggrolls were a lot longer than what I'm used to, but very good in my books.  The noodle dish came with beef tender flanks seasoned with a lemongrass sauce and your usual carrots, bean sprouts, and mint.  Not a bad dish at all and presentation wise was quite appealing; I had to add a couple more mint and bean sprouts cause I love mines with a plethora of vegetables! 

In the end, the place serves it's purpose.  The Pho according to one of my friends was okay and I'll have to take his word for it until the next time around.  However, if you need a quick Vietnamese cuisine fix; Pho Number One will deliver just fine! - Enjoy!",2014-10-27 19:25:43

It turns out they had no recollection or proof of any double charge because it was made erroneously and then quickly refunded.

I can't say it wasn't annoying to have to run around and call and go to my bank etc. But i am so happy to see that they did what was correct. I added a star because I couldn't make it a 3.5...

I wholeheartedly regret that decision after coming here during my burger binge week visit!! They were offering the Smokehouse burger for $5 for the Yelp GTA Burger Week, and at an original price of $13.50 it was such a goood deeaaaal. It had caramelized onions, peppercorn sauce and smoked cheddar. For me the peppercorn sauce was the star of the burger. So flavourful without being overpowering or salty, the sauce really brought the whole burger together for me. I also really like the fresh veggies in the burger for the simple fact that they actually tasted really fresh and made me feel less guilty about the state of my narrowing arteries. The buns were also awesome and did not dissolve into messy oblivion with the peppercorn sauce!

The #bestbossever also treated me to some sweet potato fries to share and THEY WERE THE BOMB! Sooooo crispy on the outside, and the sauce that came with it also had the perfect kick of cinnamon and spice to compliment the taste of the sweet potato.

Come for the banana walnut muffin (even if you don't think you'd like that) and stay for probably anything else. Maybe a 4 egg omelette or scramble or somesuch?

I almost got several other things, but took a little coaching from our very capable server and opted for the Crazy Chicken Omelette. There's guac and mushrooms and sliced chicken breast inside, with jack cheese on top. I went easy on the cheese, asked and got a side of jalapeÃ±os, and was in heaven. Very satisfying and not too heavy. I asked for the sour cream on the side; no problem. And with many of the entrees, like this one, you're guaranteed to get the seasoned potatoes -- which may seem a little too perfectly symmetrical to fully trust, but dang, they're good. Not too spicy nor salty, but still with a pleasant kick.

This location is plenty big, but doesn't feel like a barn. You may wait a minute or two for a table - but generally, it's looks like they're very accommodating and will make things work pretty quickly. The kids menu is crazy reasonable, and for the grown-ups, it's not bad, either. Lots to try, lots to enjoy (the pancakes look great; and the taste from one of our's Denver was outstanding).

This place was extremely hectic and got to the point of straight up dangerous, especially for little kids. The lack of staff doesn't help the madness either. 

Now don't get me wrong this place has a great concept and can be a ton of fun for kids without question. It has trampolines everywhere, american ninja type obstacles with foam pits underneath, trapeze stunts, tight ropes and a dodgeball court. It really can be fun for the whole family. 

I know this place is fairly new so maybe working out the kinks is still a work in progress but this is definitely a place u gotta be more careful than relaxed in.  I really do not recommend bringing little kids here on a Saturday evening. The place is jam packed with teenagers, since they have the jump club party for 15 and older after 9pm. Unfortunately, some teenagers seem to lack the awareness that little kids are around and more caution needs to be used when they are around. 

The dodgeball court really is great, but again when you see full grown teenagers (had to be around 17-18) wailing dodgeballs at a kids (who had to be 6-8)with full force just to get them out it makes you wonder, seriously?! Was that really neccesary. I get it, its the game but how is making kids cry game after game any fun. And its suppose to be fun for all ages right, not fun only if a 6 year old can take the dodgeball being chucked straight at his face by someone who is 3 times his size. 

I guess like any place nothing will really be done until something really drastic happens which makes people open their eyes. Sad but its reality.

But this experience was super annoying. Customer service however is great. They are very friendly and comfortable with their coworkers. 

But they cannot seem to get this whole coffee making thing correct.
I generally order the same thing every time I get a Blonde Cinnamon Almond Macchiato for me and Americano  Nuevo for my bf. The girl at my Starbucks makes his Americano Nuevo on the clover. 

So I get here order the same thing. First the cashier doesn't know how to type them into the register, asks another guy and he tells me they usually do it w brewed coffee. I said ok but I usually get it this way is that ok. He says oh ye and tells the cashier he has to put it in as some other coffee and add a shot of this and a blend of that. I was confused but maintained my faith since I love me some Starbucks.

The girl finally hands me the coffee( huge line up btw w only one cashier and 3 ppl stocking and ""cleaning"", 2 on coffee). i look at it and see bubbles on the top and automatically know its incorrect. Taste it and its horribly. Iwait for the second coffee and my bf comes in from next door. I tell him taste it, he asks what it it i said same thing I always get. no its not lol, yes it is.

So I tell the girl its incorrect and she says do I want her to make it again , obviously it would taste the same . I wasn't sure if it was how she made it or what the guy wrote.She asks the other girl to make it over for me, But I wasn't impressed at all either way, so I said no just give me a caramel macchiato. I figured should be easy its a popular drink. The second drink came up as well, tasted so burned and gross. My bf didn't believe once again it was his regular drink. He said it tastes like Ikea coffee smh.

First time we had more than half a starbucks coffee gone to the garbage.

It was, however, a pleasant surprise as I was looking for some quick (but not ""fast"") food to take home, and wanted to be seen by as few people as I could in my sweaty workout attire.  The nature of this kind of restaurant doesn't lend to as speedy of a drive-thru experience as your typical fast-food chains, but in this case it was worth it to avoid getting out of the car.  Points for enabling the lazy.

The food is pretty standard from Panda to Panda.  Contrary to popular belief there is actually no panda meat in the food, but chicken, beef, shrimp, and plenty of veggies.  The orange chicken is mine and America's favorite dish, but I also love the beef and broccoli.  I think there's more room for error with beef than with chicken, though, when it comes to anything made in bulk.  I choose half noodles/half fried rice, which is the best of both worlds.  All that for right around $7 puts it a little pricey for the average lunch, but not bad if you consider the alternative was probably a Big Mac.

This location appears to be conveniently located at the intersection of Ray and the 101, but is awkward to get out of, due to the no-left-turns onto Ray.  To get back to the 101 you have to go all the way around the shopping center.

However, my meal and the mini teasing bites of steak that I did have were incredible.  

I ordered the chicken confit, which is served with a side of the truffle mac n cheese.  If this wasn't a steakhouse, then I would order it again in a heartbeat.  It was bursting with flavor.  My husband ordered the skirtsteak and i took a bite of it, and savored the flavorful tenderness.  On a previous visit, he ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye and he claims that it was the best steak he has ever had.  On this particular visit, he wasn't very hungry, hence the smaller order.  Our friends ordered the ribeye and the filet mignon, and they enjoyed every bite.  They shared the truffle mac n cheese sides and the spinach souffle.  Everything was devoured.  In fact, we practically had to tear the truffle mac n cheese bowl away from our friend before he started licking it clean. 

I also did try the 3 types of complimentary duck fat fried french fries and the accompanying sauces.  The truffle dipping sauce was heavenly.  I am surprised that I was able to restrain myself the way I did.  

The food isn't the only thing calling my name... So is the House made ROCK N' RYE cocktail.  Holy sweet mother of Jesus! This drink is amazing. It consists of Wild Turkey Rye infused with Rock Candy, Citrus & Aromatics. The flavors are melded together for 30 days before it is poured over one giant ice cube.  This alone is a 5 star cocktail.  I can't wait to return and have a whole glass to myself.  Or maybe even two. 

Reservations are a must! Be warned- it is quite loud at this restaurant.  It was a little difficult to have a conversation without leaning in to hear, but it is definitely a fun atmosphere.

(My MIL lives in the area. So we start here and work our way up to the Boulevard Mall.) We were about number 50 or so in the line, at the door. So, it was funny when we saw our friends in the number 1 position. Small world, huh? It was a little crazy, but that is how it is on Black Friday. We ended up with some good deals- we looked at the circulars the night before, so we were prepared. The Kohl's Cash promotion was also motivation to shop here. Spend $50, get $10 in Kohl's Cash- specified dates. The line to pay was pretty long, but this is another thing to expect. If you're smart, you'll have one person in line, another to do the shopping, and switch off- it's a system. I bet we'll be back again for Black Friday shopping this year- just around the corner.

The store was organized, nice displays, and had a good offering of merchandise- surprisingly. (Considering the last time we were in this store, we were there for the Going Out Of Business sale- Mervyn's, which was sad- I shopped there as a kid for ""Back to School"".)

We also came over last weekend for an exchange.

Should have written a review from my first visit several years ago, it would have been better. 
We liked it so much the first time that we planned on eating there when we went down to Boulder City.

 We stopped in at dinner time and only a few people were seated outside. 
We ordered an antipasto salad, spaghetti & meatballs and a small cheese pizza. 

The salad came out first, it was some cold cuts and cheese sliced in strips on top of iceberg lettuce that had seen better days, tomatoes were mushy from being cut early that morning, lots of ripe olives, banana peppers and oregano. Not too appealing to the eye and I've had better. Silverware would also be nice instead of plastic forks, if you're paying almost 9 bucks for a salad, it would be better not to eat with plastic

The spaghetti came with one meatball. The meatball was very flavorful, wish there was more.. The sauce was also very flavorful and thick.

The pizza, although again not eye appealing the crust with the sauce did have great flavor.. If you like tomatoes, you're going to like the sauce. The cheese kept sliding off but it was good & chewy. 

Eating outside was nice, no atmosphere inside, and appeared that it needs a good cleaning.

Recently, I've noticed the quality of fruits and vegetables were not top quality. I can't tell you how many onions and potatoes I've had to throw out after only a few days. I know not to store them together. The last time I bought onions I purchased them separately,( because I noticed the bagged onions and potatoes ALWAYS had one rotten piece in them, which makes the rest go rotten). Not two days later, the onions were completely black with some type of mold. It's not just root vegetables either. I bought cucumbers that I put into the crisper in my fridge. Couple days later I went to grab it and it was mush. 
So now this brings me to this. A couple of weeks ago, ( I just had no time to post this until today), I bought a family pack bone in pork chops. I brought them home to divide into portions. When I opened the cellophane, the smell was so bad. The chops were green underneath the first layer. My husband took them back and they gave him another pack.

Upon entering the the showroom I was promptly greeted by Sales Guide Donny Tackett. He showed me some cars on the lot and offered a test drive. I had researched quite extensively and I had an idea of their inventory. I knew exactly what I wanted. Sport, White with Black roof and a light interior. 
Easy. 
Before I had the chance to share my requirements with Donny we were setting out on our test drive and he pointed out a car that had just arrived. It was covered in the plastic that protects the new car during transit. I couldn't really see what it even was! He explained it was a LTD edition HST. So I had been researching for days, I knew it all, I thought. Wrong. I'd never even heard of this car. Upgraded motor, different interior, wheels and much more. So not white, not a light interior but simply beautiful. 

After test drive we sat at the desk. Gulp. Get ready, here we go.  Hand over the keys to my Audi for appraisal and brace for low offer. Second time today I was wrong. They made a very fair offer, we negotiate briefly, they sweetened the deal a little and we agreed the transaction. It's now One o'clock. We arrange pick up at six. 

Arrive at Six. All is perfect, car is clean. Donny thoroughly explains the car, connects Bluetooth, arranges DMV paperwork. Outstanding. 

Car dealing can be contentious but shouldn't be. It should be enjoyable and at Land Rover LV I am delighted to say it was extremely enjoyable.

often times i will get a burrito bowl to go and take it home to eat it since i am LITERALLY 4 streets away. this might be a weird thing to look forward to, but when I get a to go order, i like that when i get to the place i am eating at, the steam from the hot food has melted the cheese inside the container. however, at this chipotle, i have to actually put my food in the microwave to heat it up because it was never that warm to begin with. how is it even possible for my food to be so luke warm when i am only traveling a few minutes away? 

in addition, almost every time i've gone to this particular location, there has been a to go order being made when i arrived. of course this is not chipotle's fault, but every time that's happened, i have been completely ignored to make the order. no greeting, no ""we'll be with you in a minute"", just employees pretending i don't exist until their 15 burrito to go order has been completed. why can't you let me order quickly in between? i know exactly what i want; it will take 30 seconds. my favorite is when no one has even arrived to pick it up by the time i have waited, gone through the line, paid and left. why are you rushing to make food for customers who aren't even RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU ALREADY? i am also then fully aware that i am getting the bottom of the pan food because the fresher stuff has been used for customers who aren't even there yet.

We were hesitant because the only seating left was in the back row when we purchased the tickets but still bought them hoping for the best and were very happy about it because we could stand if we felt we were missing something on stage due to someones head in the way but honestly it was only to look at the floor stage otherwise you can stiil have a great view from the back row !
Cattle ranch is a little tricky because the street its on is not very lit, in a neighborhood and there is a small sign in the drivway that says circus of illusion that canbe easily missed.  Its a very small and intimate venue but it definitely works.

However, I guess with the new job's dress code, it's become too casual for me. Even the dress clothes that the Gap carries looks more like something more suitable for a club in my opinion. And for the young too, which I'm not anymore. 

Anyway - it's ok for casual clothes I guess when I can find stuff that isn't for the skinny or slim fit kind of guys. I like my clothes comfortable, which means not fitted and it's getting hard to find them for me these days.

I was excited when I saw it first opened and couldn't wait to try this east coast staple. We ordered the Smoke Shack burger, Shack-cago dog, cheese fries and a drink. This all came out to about $20. 

Pros: the fries. Omg the fries. I would come back for the cheese fries alone. The burger and hot dog were also both pretty good as well. But the fries were the standout for me. 

Cons: we came on a Friday night around 6:30pm and they only had 2 out of the 3 registers open so we had to wait in line for quite some time before ordering. 
Next would have to be the size and pricing of the food. I was shocked when we picked up our dinner at how small the portions were.  Like I said, the food was good but if I'm going to pay $20 for cheeseburgers and hot dogs dinner I would at least like to get my money's worth. We were hungry again by the time we got home. :(

Not that this dish doesn't deserve 'em both, it's just that I'm not one to repeat things unnecessarily. Omit needless words, that's what Strunk & White would say. Sharp guys.

As for the food, I've had the burger, wings and pasta, and all were very good. I was especially impressed with the pasta (they have pasta night on Tuesdays, and I believe it's $5 a dish for either spaghetti with meatballs, lasagna or fettuccini with wine sauce).

- beef tongue: yum
- galbi: very well marinated, and very very tender
- fried rice: i know youre full, but trust me when i say, ORDER THIS. your stomach will say it's full, but you keep putting your spoon out for just one more bite. and then another bite. and then another. and then you look down at the grill and realize that its all gone! oh noes! oink oink!

- no wait! im used to the LA branch where the wait can be atrocious (at least ~45 mins)
- service was pretty good for an asian place. the ding dong bell on the table really helped

DÃ©cor - Truly appreciated the lack of faux Chinese dÃ©cor.  Loved the lightness/airiness of the place.  Seating could be placed a little farther apart, but hey, it still beats 99% of the Chinese restaurants around. 

Food - 
Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Potstickers - Well done and you could actually taste each component, but nothing overpowered anything else. Yum!

Rolled Onion Pancake w/ Sliced Beef - Never seen this dish here in Pittsburgh, but I have had it elsewhere and this one stacks up pretty well.  Double yum!

Taiwanese Style Pork Belly Slider - Okay, braised pork belly with fragrant soy/ginger/garlic goodness?  Come on, man!  How can you go wrong!  Chinese Happy Family yum!

The random chairs and black/white floor sets off a hipster vibe like no other. The bar serves food and boasts a ""No Smoking"" policy, which I am totally down with.

Drinks though, as others have noted, are pricey. These are prices I would expect to pay on the strip, not in some random lofts next to a beauty salon downtown. Downtown is known for having these great bars with great drinks prices - so that is where Lady Sylvia is lacking. 

While there during happy hour ($6 wines/$3 beers/lower well drink prices) my friends and I partook of their wine. I happened to have the Rock N Roll Wine which they are offering at $3 a glass during the month of August. My friends had wine as well. I decided, what the hell, I'll try one of the cocktails (the $12 ones, NOT the $14 ones, are you freaking kidding me? I can get better mixed drinks than these at Comme Ca during their happy hour for LESS!). I had the 18b, a very nice concoction featuring blueberry vodka. I will admit, Kenny, the bartender, knows how to mix it up well. 

The food - while we were there they were serving up tapas (called something else with a ""p"", but basically - tapas). They basically placed them all on a side of the bar and it was buffet style. Go up, get what you want and then tell the bartender what you had. Honesty policy pretty much. I had two tapas - don't remember their names, but they were pretty good. But they were all served on slices of thick, toasted bread. I like that they serve food - I just don't like the way they do it. None of the tapas were noted as to what they actually were. I picked up something I thought was seafood, but when I bit into it, it was definitely potatoes. The food is yes, a great idea, I think they just need to work on how they DO IT. 

Last but not least a few minor flaws - the gaming machines on the bar - why? While I was there not one person was gaming, not one. Young, hipster Las Vegans do not go Downtown to gamble. Lose the machines and the bar would be much better. And lastly - while my friends and I were there a couple came in the bar and brought in two dogs. The woman actually sat at the bar and held the dog in her lap. I mean, it was a serious WTF moment for me. Who brings dogs into a bar? What kind of bar (especially one that serves food) allows people to bring in their dogs? And no, these dogs were not seeing-eye dogs. THAT is one of the reasons I dropped this place a whole star. Without the dog fiasco it probably would have been 4.

So - visually pleasing, decent drinks (yet, again, pricey) a good bartender - in all honesty, had a decent time. Would I go back? Probably during happy hour. Would I be back on say, a Saturday night? Nah. I'll go to Vanguard and Downtown Cocktail Lounge for that.",2012-08-15 15:43:33

Thai on Yonge is my go-to Thai restaurant when I'm around the downtown core. It's low-key, clean, and makes me feel nostalgic about Thailand.

As of this review, I've had their green curry chicken as well as the chicken pad thai. The curry was aromatic and soupy-like, and thankfully not oily or spicy. Meanwhile the pad thai was well balanced and very filling. Additionally, I had their Thai iced tea and was extremely satisfied. It's milky sweetness flavor was perfect and left me craving for more. I'd highly recommend ordering this especially on a hot summer day.

Overall, Thai on Yonge is an amazing hidden gem that's worth checking out. I'd recommend visiting this place sooner rather than later because I predict that it might close down in the near future due to the aggressive condo developments on Yonge Street.",2018-09-03 17:52:41

Food is a hit or miss for me. I am a huge fan of falafel in general. I find their falafel to be a bit on the dry side some days, and good on some others. I've mitigated that by ordering extra tahini on the side, but unfortunately they charge for that. The hummus and pita also help with the dryness. Sometimes the hummus is loaded with a bit too much oil for my tastes, which can make it kind of unappetizing. I don't know if it's just me, but their falafel has a sort of bitter taste in the actual patties. It's just....different. The prices are a bit expensive compared to the quality, and they always seem to be going up.

A plus is the remodeling he's done on the place. Before, it looked like a hole in the wall place where you would wipe the table down yourself before eating there. Now, it has booths, a new paint job and a whole overall new look. Its pretty nice. After four years of going here though, I always get confused by the counter ordering system.",2012-06-26 18:46:42

We decided on Mimi's since it's kinda like Chili's - everybody will be able to find something to eat. 

I went here on August 19th around 8:30ish PM.   The place was completely dead yet it still took a good 10 minutes for a table to be set up for 9 of us (we were seated at a large round table.) 

I don't know why,  but for an empty place, we sure got terrible service. I got one refill despite us being there more than an hour and a half. I wasn't the only one at the table with the lack of refill. Nobody would take away our dishes either, so we were stacking all our bread plates, salad plates, dinner plates, trash, bread baskets, and empty cups on the lazy susan so we'd have enough room on the table to eat. I have the picture to prove it too.

I tried to order my usual - the kid's meal turkey dinner, no potatoes, double stuffing, with an unsweetened ice tea. Nope, the waitress wouldn't let me because I'm not under 12. I hate these age restrictions on menus - especially since I've ordered this a million times to go back in Cali. I ended up ordering the French Dip with no sides, just a side salad, no croutons with ranch. After picking out the croutons, the salad was fine. 

It took a long time for the meals to come out, and my sister and aunt only ordered french onion soup - and for some reason, they had to wait about 10 minutes after everybody else's food to come out to get their soups. We eat as a family so our food was getting cold waiting for their meals to come out. My French Dip came with cole slaw that I didn't order - BLEH. It was gross (I hate cole slaw, so I'm biased.) I took half of my sandwich home and tried to wrap it in a paper doily I found in the bread basket to protect it from the nasty cole slaw that my dad said he'd eat. I ended up throwing out the bread and just eating the meat off of the sandwich the next day. Meh.

For 9 of us to eat (2 of the meals were kids' meals,  2 French onion soups, 2 adult turkey dinners, 1 broiled chicken dish, 1 beef dish and a French dip sandwich) it was about $105 and they still couldn't clear off the table or get the check to us in a timely manner. BOO.

I love Apple. I love this store. I love some of its staff. I make appointments online or via the Apple app on my phone. Sometimes they'll over book and you'll have to wait a while past your appointment time. I'm a pretty patient person, especially when I'm acknowledged, and this is usually this case. I've only had one guy who was rude, never acknowledged that I was waiting, and had the worse laissez-faire attitude. We do not take laissez-faire when it comes to our tech lifelines, mister! Luckily, he was only one amongst dozens. 

They've saved my (ancient) MacBook Pro from what I know is inevitable. They have no problems swapping out a faulty iPhone, as soon as they do their obligatory water test. They even replaced a charger that had stopped working on my DD's phone, and we didn't even have Apple Care for that particular phone. 

Large store with lots of test items and lots of accessories. Nice view of Scottsdale Rd outside the main window. A familiar view for all who've sat at the Genius bar awaiting the verdict on their products.  I may or may not have cried at that counter after finding out photos were lost during a botched software update attempt. 

They get extremely busy during weekends and in the evenings. I suggest making an appointment for any and everything; even if it's just a question. If you don't make an appointment online they accept walk-ins too, you'll just have to wait longer for them to squeeze you in.

lkdQIcyqrYxMGWmfiIFFOA,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A,5,4,1,2,"Pretty much anyone who knows me realizes how I feel about Thomas Keller's approach to the culinary arts.  Truely a ""chef's chef"" I've always respected his desire to remain authentic, to not let his empire spread too far or too wide, and his strong dedication to the progression of America's culinary scene - donations to the Culinary Institute, working with the US Culinary Olympic team, etc.  Without overstating, though I still rank Alinea as my favorite meal of all time, I consider Keller my favorite chef.  Having been to each of Keller's restaurants except for Per Se in 2009 it was only logical that I make my way back to Bouchon for Saturday brunch on my most recent trip to Las Vegas - especially since it was only 2 floors away from my hotel room.

Arriving at the doors of Bouchon around 7:50 there was already a line of 8 people waiting and by the time the doors opened at 8:00 there were nearly 20.  Browsing the sign of specials I thought the crabcakes benedict sounded good, but not nearly as good as what I'd come for originally.  Making my way into the restaurant and meeting with the hostess I asked for a table for one outdoors if possible and was swiftly taken to the precise table I enjoyed the previous year.  Handed a menu to browse my coffee was filled (so much better than the coffee at the continental breakfast) and I was brought a water after declining a cocktail.
 
Returning after a short time my server explained the specials and asked if I had any questions - stating no I placed my orders and requested some of the infamous epi-baguette to go with the house made butter and fresh preserves (strawberry this time) that were already on the table.  Receiving a ""branch"" of two pieces - and later two more - these wonderful pieces of carbohydrate reminded me again of just how good a simple baguette can be when using quality ingredients.  Creamy and grassy the butter went largely underutilized instead opting for the jam which displayed the very essence of strawberries and a small cup of nutella (an unexpected $2.50 surcharge.)

Beginning the meal along with my second cup of coffee was a slice of Almond Brioche.  Served piping hot from the griddle the bread was buttery and sweet with perfectly toasted almonds contrasting well with the soft bread.  Similar to the brioche served with the foie gras terrine at The French Laundry (plus almonds) this was toast at its very best.

My main course, arriving with another refill of my coffee (yes, I have a caffeine problem) was the dish I knew I'd order the moment I decided to return to Bouchon - Keller's Chicken and Waffles.  Unobtainable at any other Thomas Keller restaurant (much like the French Toast Bread Pudding) the mere thought of this dish had me excited and it certainly didn't disappoint - better than Roscoe's, Crops, or Seldom Blues...by far.  The chicken, instead of being traditionally Southern fried was instead marinated in thyme and rosemary, then slow roasted for 13 hours and pan-flashed to crisp the skin.  Perfectly smooth, incredibly juicy, the chicken alone would have justified the trip.  Further enhancing the impressive plate were the waffles - four quartered pieces accented with buttermilk, bacon, chives, and (per the server) a bit of chicken stock.  Served alongside the main components of the dish was a delectable Tahitian vanilla bean butter, pure Vermont maple syrup, and sauce chasseur - essentially a gravy of chicken stock, bacon lardons, mushrooms, and onion.  A flawless array of crispy and soft, savory and sweet, nuanced and ""in your face"" - an absolutely lovely dish worth every penny of the $25 pricetag.

Sitting and sipping my coffee in the sun rising over the Venezia pools I couldn't help but think about other meals at Thomas Keller restaurants - honestly, aside from a stale cinnamon brioche (admittedly a flaw,) a piece of cheese (simply not my style,) and some spicy walnuts ( good, but not at that time in the meal) I've not yet had an item that was less than impressive - and many items were not just impressive, but formed the prototype for what I think that item is in its near-perfect form.  While service can sometimes be a tad ""cool,"" or ""stiff"" it is always professional and the settings, ingredients, and experience uncompromisingly refined.  While I still have to try Verandah and Hash House a Go-Go to complete my ""to do list"" for breakfasts in Vegas, unless they truly wow I do believe I'll simply be frequenting Bouchon from now on when visiting the strip.",2009-10-15 01:13:24

I'm not real familiar with Filipino food and asked our waiter what spices are used in the Chicken Inasal. He said, ""I don't know but it's a good choice."" I order it anyway and then our waiter starts SINGING KARAOKE. Starting with ""Love is a many splendid thing"" followed by many Frank Sinatra tunes. He sings well and it is kinda neat but a little weird.

Someone runs my husband's plate out. I wait at least ten minutes and then someone runs my plate out. Both meals had a very home style quality to them. Both had falling apart tender meat that was infused with flavors. The Beef Kalderetta tasted like a beef stew that anyone's grandmother would make but with two french fries instead of potatoes. The Chicken Inasal was a whole chicken leg on the bone that was marinated and grilled and served with a vinegar-soy kind of sauce for dipping.

The baked goods look inviting to us and I read on the Phoenix New Times that these baked goods are among the Best in the Phoenix Area so I wanted to try some.

We ordered the mango and ube (purple yam) tarts to try. A waitress brings them and I notice a big crack on the purple tart and it looks very dry. We try to eat them but neither of us can PENETRATE the tarts with a fork because they are very hard. My husband breaks them open with his hands and they are hard like rocks and are inedible. We bring this to the attention of the waitress and she says the manager will talk to us. He brings out one new purple tart and says nothing is wrong with his tarts and they just needed to be warmed up. I think to myself well then who is suppose to warm them up? Am I suppose to bring my own personal oven with me when I go out to eat? The new tart he brought over was good unlike the first tarts. Our hard mango tart just stayed on the table. We get the bill then pay and leave. The manager runs after us and says that we didn't have to pay for the desserts. That sort of rubbed us the wrong way because nobody took the desserts off the bill and nobody told us we didn't have to pay for them.

Broccoli Beef. Pretty good. Broccoli was fine, beef a little chewy.

I've been coming here as a child and as an adult and have always enjoyed the glitz and glamor of the World Famous Las Vegas Strip.  It's definitely the place to see and be seen. It has evolved many times from being the adult Disneyland to being more family oriented to back to being the adult Disneyland. 

The waves change every ten years and so does the profitability of the strip.

When the economy is running on all cylinders there are high occupancy levels and gaming revenues. When the economy is slow you'll find less people and more homeless people on the walkways and streets.

With the closing of several iconic hotels to make way for openings of newer and more lavish mega resorts I've come to enjoy the transitions.  Being able to pinpoint where establishments used to be and what they are now makes me feel old and nostalgic.

The Las Vegas Strip has always been the iconic place to visit when you turn 21,22,102! 

So much to see and so much to do in so little time.  

From binge drinking, boxing, buffets, concerts, fine dining, gambling shopping, to sight seeing, UFC - whatever you want to do, you can and at any time of the day or night. You can do it by foot, car, monorail or simply by sitting in your room.

Something about Las Vegas and the strip still entices me to come back and always yearning for more. I've vowed to stay in every hotel on the strip as well as downtown before I kick the bucket. I've amassed many room keys and do not disturb signs as well as a few matches. Consider it hoarding... But I want to be able to tell my grandkids that I've been here and there and this is my proof of the good times I've had in Vegas.

Apparently there used to be 64 flavors out at one time, but now there are somewhere in the 30's area and a case for cakes. Frankly, I don't care that there aren't 64 flavors to choose from at one time. That would be overwhelming. There are generally enough choices to keep everyone happy.

Flavor wise, the fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. They are more icy than ice-creamy. So I don't tend to get those much. The pistachio and chocolate amaretto are my two favorite flavors though. I go back to them the most. I have also enjoyed butterfinger, just because I love butterfingers. Most of the other flavors are good as well.

For the sizes available the price for gelato here is also a good deal. We get smalls for $3.15 each. One of the cheaper prices we have seen among all gelato shops. And you can mix flavors in your cups. Two flavors in small and medium, and up to three flavors in the large size. 

We have had to stop coming in though just because we both gained some weight over the summer and we are both on a health kick, trying to lose the pounds. But I would come back here again eventually.",2011-08-25 00:22:21

I guess I just can't fathom why people would rather throw their money away on something just for convenience sake.  If you like cookies so much, try making them yourself and save a couple bucks.  Other people really seem to love the cookies, but it's just not a place for me.  It just boils down to how lazy people are... or how addictive their personalities are.

I had both the Monkey Fuzz Gimlet and the White Peach Margarita. Just enough to get me buzzed before retiring to my room after a long two-day meeting.

I wasn't certain while using the app for delivery whether it was accurate or not. I've spent the past 9 months in Gilbert with very limited delivery options. When I say limited, I mean, there's been but a couple pizza joints to order from.

I'm not really a pizza enthusiast so, I've starved many late nights for this reason. 

I always check just to see if there have been changes. Well, two places apparently deliver. In my disbelief, first thing I did was call to check since they appeared to be a little ways away. The gentleman was very kind on the phone in confirming they'd come out to us. I used the app to place my order because I feel it's much easier that way. Therefore I was basing it off of the menu on here. I ordered samosas for the kid, a combo beef shrimp kabob platter for the man, a side of kabuli style rice and the vegetable qorma. I was so excited! Within minutes I received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served the vegetable qorma, and so went with the spinach qorma instead.

Honestly, the call alone was a very noble move on their end. Not to mention, I just checked to see what it was that I ordered and it appears that the menu has already been updated on the Yelp app so, kudos for that as well!

Although the wait time was closer to the 75 minute mark, the order arrived still hot and correct. 

That rice? So so so so so good! I didn't try much of anyone else's dishes and can't speak to much more other than they looked appealing and no one complained. The 7 year old didn't even make a stink about this foreign item that she devoured.

So I can't say the food was bad, it just wasn't anything I felt would be worth returning to ( which bums me out, definitely had been wanting to try this place out for years). However, my fiance loved his food (the banh mi) & will probably be returning without me.

Again, the service was excellent. And the atmosphere is beautiful!!!! Wouldn't mind keeping it exactly as is & turning it into my own home, lol. The presentation of food was also beautiful and the environment was clean. So, don't pass this place up, just maybe call ahead & make sure the object of your midday stomach grumbling desire is available first before you make the trip.",2013-02-22 03:44:18

This included 6 California Rolls and a good selection of Nigiri which included:  3 pieces of tuna (Maguro);  3 pieces of salmon (Sake); 3 pieces of snapper (Tai); and 3 pieces of eel (Unagi).  The employees were cheerful and friendly. The hostess offered us tea and/or water while we waited even though we were just getting take-out.  I liked the decor and overall feel of the place. 

When we got home and dug into the sushi, I was impressed. Sushi rice had good texture, the fish was fresh and tasted good w/just a small smear of wasabi between the rice and the fish.  Of course, the sushi was packaged alongside the standard additional dollop of wasabi and a nice pile of pickled ginger on the side.   

The pricing is in line with other area sushi places. Overall, I was pleased with the sushi and definitley will go back.",2011-05-28 17:49:07

We made reservations for a Friday at 6 pm but we didn't need to as it was pretty dead. It picked up later but definitely not full like I thought it would have been.

As you would expect in Vegas, it was very stylish and beautiful and grand, with big comfy seats and huge wooden tables, a big open kitchen to see through, yadda yadda. The service was very friendly and nice without the super posh annoyingness that you get at some places (you know what I'm talking about). Our server was helpful and cool and he had a team of backups to help him out, all of whom were good as well.

There were seven of us and they kindly gave us some complimentary duck fat fries with some amazeballs dipping sauces. Seriously these were the best duck fat fries I have ever had. We then each ordered an entree and split up some appetizers. The appetizers - mac and cheese, creamed corn, potato puree, and some mushrooms. All of it was out of this world except the mushrooms, which was just regular damn good. I ended up with the angus filet mignon and it was also freakin delicious. The others at the table were equally impressed with their various entrees as I heard lots of mmmmms and ahhhhhss.

I was there about 9pm on a Friday night, and the staff could not have been nicer.  Before deciding, I tasted several flavors and they heaped several more upon me.  ""If you like that, then you'll like this...""  I must have collected almost ten of those multi-color mini gelato putty knives that they use as tasting utensils.  I finally chose two flavors:  the peanut butter oreo and the mud pie.  The peanut butter oreo had a rich peanut buttery taste and a smooth, creamy texture.  It was outstanding.  The mud pie was a combination of a few different flavors.  It was a little firmer and left the after taste of bad coffee.

Since I got there first they warmed up the water for us while I picked my polish. They were sweet enough to wait tell Dyanna got there to start my pedicure. Meanwhile the water was all warmed up and I stuck my feet in and felt the wonderful jets! It felt amazing! Once Dyanna got there they started our pedi's and they even worked in Dyanna's other friend. All three of us were offered water which is always a nice touch in my book. I was super impressed with my pedicure. Every place I've been to in the past ends up hurting me because my feet are so sensitive, but they did not hurt me once. I was also excited when they massaged our legs with hot rocks, Talk about feeling pampered! It was great not to feel rushed after they painted our toes.They just let us sit and finish talking. Tina was so kind as to help me get my flip flops on. Super sweet of her. 

Their prices are also excellent $25 for my pedi and if I wanted the deluxe it's only $10 more!! It's been about 3 weeks since my pedi and the paint has not chipped or anything.

Luckily my workplace is close by so no excuses with not being able to come more often. I love how the walls are adorned with luchadores (wrestlers) with brilliant color schemes in this quaint taco shop. The menu is simple and you get to create your own tacos, burrito, etc. Today I went with the 5 corn street taco meal. When you select the 5 tacos, you do have the choice of 2 meats.  A hard decision to make, but I went with 2 carne asada and 3 barbacoa (seasoned shredded beef) tacos. Topped them off with cilantro and onions. The salsa bar which is free is spicy but delicious, so I added the guacamole salsa. I must admit the flavors were just as savory as when I came in a year ago. 
The freshness of the tortillas and the meats were apparent from how the ladies that work behind the counter prepared the food as you ordered. All in all a worthwhile experience from a local Tempe taco shop! So this only means I will be making more frequent trips during my lunch hour!

I like their sweet and sour pork (or chicken) a lot! I've been to many chinese restaurants, and I find that Asian King is my favourite place for this specific dish. They use really good quality meat cuts in there, and the sauce is just right... not too sour or sweet.

The fried rice however, always comes unevenly seasoned... It's really weird. Sometimes I get a spoonful of rice in my mouth that's super salty, and then another spoon that is bland. This happens every time I order fried rice here... Not too happy about that... I've had their lunch menus and they're good value/affordable. It comes with corn soup, I've never had this type of soup before. It was alright.

I find that everything else on the regular menu is pricier. Especially their dimsum...main reason why I haven't tried their dimsum.

The comments about the servers careless service is consistent with all of my visits there. It takes a while before they get on with what I ask for... like asking for another bowl of rice.

We hadn't initially anticipated doing happy hour, but since we got here before the 6pm cutoff, we decided to order a majority of our meal off the menu. They have plenty of appetizers, drinks and rolls for $5 or less on the menu. We ordered a number of different things to share. I started with a Strawberry Bangkok to drink. It was pretty refreshing, nothing amazing, but good for the price. Here is a rundown of what we ate. 

Hamachi kama - Not the best yellowtail collar I've ever had, but it was a nice size portion and at only $5 I can't complain. 

Shishito peppers - A little oversauced, but the flavor was nice nonetheless. 

Candy cane roll - My favorite of the night. Flavorful and refreshing. I'd definitely order this again, despite it not being on the happy hour menu. 

777 roll - Not a fan, despite the $5 pricetag. The flavors were just off and I probably wouldn't order it again. 

Squid legs - Chewy and overcooked. Really not a fan, wouldn't recommend. 

Salmon poke - This dish was just ok, although there was a little too much sauce and it was a little vinegary. 

Eggplant fries - Second favorite dish of the night. I'm not really a fan of deep-fried food but this was light for fries. The eggplant was really tasty and well-seasoned. Skip the mayonnaise dipping sauce it's served with. It was not good. 

We tried a few desserts as well. No standouts, but mochi is always a safe bet. 

This was a 3 1/2 star experience rounded up for their happy hour value. Most of the food quality was just ok and I don't think I'd be too interested in paying full price for most of the items. Definitely a great value and worth a visit for happy hour.

Black Bear Diner is a great diner for this side of the country:)  
Unfortunately, it's not Open 24 hours- COME ON!  At least consider the newest location on LV Blvd not far from Blue Diamond to eventually be open 24 hours.  Think about it, once that stadium opens... ;)
The staff at all he Black Bear locations never, ever disappoint.  They are bubbly, you can feel the warmth of their personalities and are they speedy!  I mainly frequent the Sahara/Durango location now. That outdoor waiting are with the bears does have appeal!  However, Mindy the waitress is superb. Last time I finished dining, we hugged.  Seriously, go and be seated in Mindy's area and you will know why she's who she is- wonderful!  All the staff are here, but she's my favorite. Yes, as it it everyone has favorites. 
Food is always great quality ingredients, prepared quickly and arrive in front of you piping hot. I usually order the tuna melt.  Being the NYer I am, I do alter it.  Try it: tuna melt, rye toast, no lettuce, but make sure that cheese is Swiss. I en a provolone would do.  No, step it up and make the change away from cheddar/yellow American cheese please;)
Always order a dessert, nope no favorite. WELL, I do.  Not telling, Simply try them all at once or over various visits!

I like Lee's because they keep it very clean and organized inside.  They have a nice selection of sandwiches (not just banh mi) and other assorted goodies, plus a bevy of drinks to quench your thirst.

Their ingredients and bread have been fresh every time I've gone in, and what this results in is me stuffing my face, all the while going ""nom nom nom"", and thinking about the ladies from the Nom Nom Truck...oops sorry, I'm daydreaming again!

If you've never had banh mi, you might think that it is weird to get a bbq pork sandwich with parsley, carrots, pickled radish and sliced jalapenos, but I implore you to try one.  You just might not go back to regular sandwiches.

The only downside is that they only take cash, but then again, it ultimately saves you some dough (worth it!).  If you're like me and would rather just not eat than pay an ATM fee, you might not care, but they do have an ATM machine (or two, I'm not sure) if you forget to bring cash.",2010-10-07 21:01:13

Came in for lunch and enjoyed the rigatoni pasta. It was a carbonara like sauce with fresh peas and guanciale. The pasta was cooked al dente and the dish was perfect. I ate until I was full and still had leftovers. I would definitely recommend this dish and would order it again.

My coworkers enjoyed the radiattore pasta and chopped salad. Both agreed that the portion size was excellent and the quality of food was great. All ingredients were fresh and we loved the open kitchen concept. Chef was putting in that work!

On top of the excellent food, the service was great. We loved that you order upon entry, and then the food is brought to you at the table. It would be a great place to have lunch with your coworkers because there's no stress about splitting the bill. Our waters were never left empty and there was someone checking on us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. On top of that, we were in and out within 45 minutes and that's with a 15 minute lag time of us finishing our drinks, loading our take out containers, and taking our time to leave. We did not feel rushed out at all.

Did I mention their awesome bar? They have an assortment of premium liquors and their wine list ranged from Italian to the Sonoma Coast. They also do $5 house red or white wine and I believe some beers? I will definitely be back to take advantage of that. Unfortunately, they don't currently serve bloody marys but I saw a table enjoying mimosas!

Overall, I think this is a great addition to the restaurants in DTLV. The restaurant decor is very cute and the restaurant is very clean. The service was excellent and the food was amazing!

GogTR64jBJZRPOEBA-myMg,0RmBe3_3nXLE6bGiC8FvGA,84WYW7OfV-IXUJk95EL5_Q,2,1,1,0,"Was always intrigued by their ""concept"" of meats coming on skewers and sliced right on your plate. And this past weekend, as part of Restaurant Week, got a chance to try them out in person. Was it worth it...No

Decor : A little to dim and red for my taste. From a far it looks fine, but get closer and you notice the slight grime on tables, the even darker ambient furniture. Our chairs had nails sticking out on the edges so that was not nice! (They really outta check that coz that can injure someone)

Service : Pleasant had it been a normal ala carte restaurant but the concept here mars the it down a notch. Once you've tried all meats/veggie ensembles, you basically then ""wait"" until that particular favorite one comes by to you, which mostly doesn't as it would just get devoured by tables before you. And then you keep waiting more....

Food : I'd give the crazy wait a pass had the food been worth the wait. Alas it wasn't. The steak variety was chewy, overly rare and devoid of any seasoning. The pork was better as it came grilled/roasted with Parmesan cheese so the moisture from the cheese helped balance the dryness of the tenderloin. The sausage was average at best and can be associated with one you get from Walmart, laden with salt. The chicken legs were weirdly tiny to make you feel they may have come from ones that were malnutrition-ed!! The lamb was a best ""MEAT"" of the worst. It too lacked seasoning and was cooked a tad dry. But the char on the outside skin gave it the a much needed boost of flavor.

Long story short - Meat varieties tragically disappointing with over cooking and gross lack of seasoning/flavors.

Now the reason why this place got 2 stars instead of 1. The absolutely and sinfully sumptuous Grilled Cinnamon Pineapple!!! Take it from me, I'm not a pineapple guy and but man o man was that  good or what!! We must've had 3 courses of it and had to wait easily 10 mins between each (The hungry parties before our table gobbled them all up before it could come to us!!) but worth it.

The so called ""Unlimited Buffet"" section has a few hits (brazilian nuts, goat cheese) but overall doesn't help bring up the atmosphere of average cooked meats going around.

Despite being Restaurant Week, it came to be $30 pp before drinks, tip and taxes. Nopes, not worth that money. I'd spend that kind anyday on better dining delights in Madison :)",2017-07-28 21:17:06

First of all, the tiny dining area is wonderful. It feels like you're eating in Harry Potter's room beneath the stairs, but in a good way. The only problem was the kitchen door--it leads right into the dining room, which was ok, but the squeak in the hinges made my skin crawl and my teeth tingle every time someone opened it. 

The choices here were overwhelming mostly because they all sound delicious! I went with one of their soups--the corn chowder--and the Mediterranean hummus wrap. Both were fantastic and I couldn't get enough of the soup!! Also, bonus: pickles that were super tasty! We finished with pumpkin cupcakes, which were probably overboard for my stuffed stomach, but oh so delicious! I love a good pumpkin product and these cupcakes WIN.

They opened 6 months ago so this place is fairly new; however, the baker has experience in many fine Toronto establishments. It's definitely a nice addition to the shopping strip along Coxwell. Mon K is a small family-run business with a very French flare. When my parents lived in Paris, there were many cafes and patisseries that looked like Mon K.

Seating is limited, but if you do snag a table, it's a nice place to relax over coffee and something to eat. Their pastries are both savory and sweet; they also have sandwiches, soups, coffee, and chocolate. 

We ordered a few things today, which were all FOUR STARS:
Egg Salad with Avocado and Tomato in a croissant 
Spinach Quiche
Creamy Mushroom Soup
Green Tea Tiramisu
French Style Short Cake

Sadly If I could review sushi alone, this place would be 5 stars but I'm keeping one star because service was ridiculous. I came in with a good friend and my FH. The place was pretty packed with about two tables open. We were told it would be a wait and a party that came after us was seated before us. I think they stepped out and we're waiting as well. There was still one table available but the wait staff were quite busy and sat us almost 25 minutes later at the open table that was available the entire time. Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ It took a few minutes to get water and menus and all three of us were going for AYCE sushi. I'd say every roll we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed. They were out of salmon kama and oysters which was a bummer. My favorite was the little tease roll, it had spicy tuna and cucumber inside and was topped with Cajun tuna, deep fried onion and jalapeÃ±o with spicy mayo, garlic ponzu and eel sauce. So effing delicious! My boyfriend had almost every nigiri on the menu and he was impressed with the rice to fish ratio, big portion of fish to rice! Nice! All the rolls were not stuffed with rice and we really did some damage and were not stuffed quickly as they give good portion of rice to fish in all their rolls. Service was lacking. We had to ask many times for water and had to fall down our waiters to order more rolls.

It was well worth the wait. First off, the service is excellent. The girl seemed more than happy to humor me when I asked for a rundown on aaaaalllllllllllll the donuts they had (since it was my first time there). She mentioned her personal favorite (the blueberry cake donut and the strawberry filled donut) and the fan favorites (the bacon donut and the fruity pebbles donut). We ended up getting a fruity pebbles donut and a glaze with red velvet crumbles since I wanted a yeast donut as opposed to a cake one, but the blueberry one and lemon poppy seed one were very appealing. I also mentioned how I saw ube ones on their social media, and the owner offered to make me them! How cool, right?

As far as the donuts, I really liked them! My friend loves Hurts, and he said that they were definitely on par. I liked the donuts because the glazed one wasn't overly sweet - you can actually taste the dough. They also weren't greasy. Two big pluses in my book! The fruit pebbles was sweeter because of the toppings, but that's to be expected. We also had to get aâ Cambodianân icedâ coffee (similar to a Vietnamese iced tea, but not as sweet) and a Thaiâ tea to wash it down, and both were refreshing.

Let me start on a positive note - I love the decor, the waitress was a total sweetheart and the fried chicken skins were excellent. However, we had some problems with our cocktail, which were never remedied. My husband, a regular vodka drinker, ordered a vodka/soda. When it arrived he took a sip because it tasted funny and asked me to taste it. I tasted it and sure enough noticed exactly what he was talking about - it tasted like tequila mixed with vodka. We informed the waitress and requested a fresh drink and she said others had complained of the same problem, but that she thinks it's just ""the type of vodka they use."" (The bar uses Titto's vodka, which my husband has had many times.) The waitress replaced the cocktail anyway and brought a fresh one, but when we tasted that one, it again tasted like tequila. My husband (who used to work in a bar) notified the waitress that the bar tender was likely not rinsing the measurer between measuring different liquors and she assured my husband that he does. Since were were sitting near the bar we were able to watch the bar tender make drinks and saw firsthand that he was definitely not rinsing the measuring cup between liquors and confirmed this was the cause of the tequila vodka soda. Since tequila has such a powerful flavor, it was finding its way into our vodka soda every time. We paid for the drink, but my husband could barely drink it. Now, onto the food - we ordered a seafood special which they offered for the evening. It consisted of five shrimp, some mussles and two oysters, along with a piece of bread and some pickled green beans. The cooks forgot to include my oysters along with my meal and they also left an item of another gentleman's dinner at my table. But the worst part of it was that the mussels were slimy and undercooked. I didn't send it back and just kind of stomached what I could and put aside much of it, because we had already complained about the drink and I didn't want to be ""that customer.""

I'm super happy that they upgraded this section from it's two little aisles to this massive part of the store, I hope they continue to add some more vegan options. (soy/almond yogurt and egg replacement, hint hint)

Bomba's drink menu is also very good. I especially love the standard margarita. The last time I visited, I sat at the bar and saw the bartender cut fresh limes and mint - and I always appreciate drinks made with fresh ingredients.

Inside of the restaurant is clean and modern, with a bar centered in the middle. I didn't ask, but it appears that there are no soft drinks, and I didn't see anyone drinking tea, just water (which is what we had) and beer/wine. 

We got the Sweet Potato fritters with sorghum butter to start and it was impressive. Great fry on the fritters and a sweet, rich flavoring on the butter.

My entree was full of flavor but had many technical errors. I got the Fried Chicken platter with Mac & Cheese, SautÃ©ed Mushrooms, and Green Beans. Chicken was just slightly overcooked with dry meat, I did choose the white meat instead of the dark, which probably would have been more forgiving moisture-wise, but I expected a finer attention to detail from a restaurant specializing in southern cooking. Mushrooms were very flavorful but perhaps placed in a very cold bowl because they were lukewarm while the rest of my food was hot. Green beans were full of flavor, perfectly seasoned, but very stringy. My girlfriends shrimp and grits were outstanding, I kinda wish I had gotten the same thing! 

Had I gotten this meal anywhere else it probably would have been close to a 4 star review, but as a self-proclaimed Southern Kitchen, I expected these fundamental dishes to be perfect, especially 1 block away from Trade & Tryon. I'll be back and at least I know what to look for on the next visit.

So, I arrived with my crew 10:30ish Saturday night. Some guy tried to hustle us for half the admission price with his passes. Sure, buddy, let's move along now.

After some wait, I paid my $20 cover only to discover the club was practically empty. We did some drinking and then by 11, I was the first one on the dance floor. The music was good but they claimed it was Madonna night. And they only played three Madonna songs. What's up with that?

I met some nice gay boys. At some point, one of my friends was asking why I was meeting some many people and not them. Ha! What can I say? Gay men love me because I'm one of them?

If I had to compare this club to something in LA, I would say it's a really big Mickey's type club. People are more into dancing here than say the Abbey. 

I have no idea how much drink prices are individually but I think it's on the steeper side. I bought two drinks and a bottle of water and got charged over $35. 

Make sure you get stamped when you go inside. I somehow ended up outside for a bit and they wouldn't let me back in the way I came because ""they were now a different club"" and the bouncer wanted to charge me another $10.

For dinner I enjoyed the veal chop. Honestly this is the first time I had a veal chop but it wont be the last. I am a fan!!! The chop was expertly prepared, cooked, and presented. More importantly with the accompanying sauce it was also absolutely delicious.

My mom, sister, and I stopped in and literally spent two hours. Now that might not sound earth shattering, but the place isn't gigantic; it's just packed to the rafters with finds from all over. In speaking to the very friendly clerk, she advised me that there are some vendor spots scattered throughout the store, but that the vast majority of items literally come from estate sales that Michael buys out. 

The prices are VERY reasonable and they literally have a little bit of everything - from high end designer pieces to knock offs that will give you pause. Each one of us found things we couldn't live without and I was even able to finish some of my holiday shopping for the ""impossible"" to please family. 

This place is definitely being added to my list of go to places because I'm sure their stock changes frequently. 

So what could possibly earn a used item store a 5-star rating? 
1) Ask if they are having specials. When we were there, certain types of items were all on sale and since we were each buying armfuls, they applied a further discount on top of the total price! 
2) This place doesn't have even a hint of that Goodwill/Savers smell that makes you want to breathe through your mouth. Quite the contrary, they had some lovely scented candles for sale and had samples burning throughout the store.

I really enjoyed my time at the lens factory.  Took the beginner / intermediate class and it was definitely more beginner than it was intermediate.  I also think the class is more geared towards those who own DSLRs than point and shoots.  I felt bad for the more advanced students in the class ... and by the end of the class, the number of students did taper off significantly.

Another review mentioned that it was difficult to see the television screen from the back.  Well, when I took the class, there were two large high definition screens for the class to view the presentations.  

If the class was filled to capacity it would be a little squishy but it was never full (except for the first day) so there was elbow and crossing leg room.

Although the classes were informative, I wish there had been more practical critiques of our work.  The last class was particularly dull and impractical.  75% of the class was spent on the technical side of printing .  Something that would have been more helpful would have been to show us how to prepare our work to be printed i.e, cropping to proportion, fine tuning our editing, etc.  It would have also been nice to go through all the pictures submitted by our classmates so we could see each other's work.  Instead, only a few photographs were shown - even though everyone brought in their work.

More homework assignments and time spent reviewing and critiquing homework would have made the classes more interesting and practical.  A lot of the time, the information in our handout/ presentation could have been reviewed in 30 - 45 minutes but it was dragged out.  I also found the most practical advice was given by one of my classmates who seemed to know everything about his camera, memory card, lens, filters, etc.  Thankfully we owned the same camera - I learned soooo much from him! 

I would definitely consider taking another class at the Lens Factory but I would be interested in trying a different class with a different instructor.  I wish we could have had the pleasure of having Len teach a few of our classes since others have commented so positively on his teaching style.  

Oh, and on the last class, Len offered to provide us with a complimentary 16 * 20 print of our work!  :)

Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don't have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  

Food: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn't come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren't mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  

Overall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn't deliver.  Staff was friendly, but not very good at servicing people.  

The only good thing about this place is it's on restaurant.com, so we were able to save $50 off by using the certificate.  Didn't have to pay very much for the unpleasant dinner.  We will definitely NOT returning again and will continue to go back to our favorite still ; Hot N Juicy!",2010-08-21 06:54:47

If I had to rate The Suffolk punch purely on decor and ambiance, I'd give it a whole 5 star rating. Unfortunately, there's so much more to consider.
The food was average at best, the service was really quite terrible (the drinks took foreverrrrr to get to us, some things never made it to us at all, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time)
The first time we went there in the morning for a cup of coffee, we were so excited because 1) the coffee was awesome 2) the decor was even more awesome. We couldn't wait for them to be open for dinner. and when they were, we decided to check it out with some friends.
We ordered a lot of food, almost everything on the menu - from the potato croquettes to the foie gras popcorn, from the beet salad to the pickles, the punch burger to the market fresh fish - and while non of the food was terrible, none of it was memorable either. The overall experience however was a memorable one because it was expensive and underwhelming. 
The drinks that did make it to our table were good, but when you have to wait 20 minutes for a drink, they ought to be amazing - either the drink menu needs to be simplified, or the bar service upped.
There's tremendous unrealized potential here... perhaps things will improve with time?",2017-09-20 14:50:47

Who would have thought that a Toronto based joint could house such a fantastic lobster shack. I was pleasantly surprised.

I'm already a fan of the Ossington/Dundas hood, so having another great restaurant there doesn't hurt. Immediately walking through the doors, I felt comfortable. The seafood bar staring right in front of me, as spectacular anything could be,. It was gorgeous, full of snow crab legs, oysters, and other crustaceans, shellfish, marine living deliciousness. 

While seated, I enjoyed the relaxing and casual atmosphere. Dim lighting, full tables, comfortable seats. The menu was simple. Not intimidating, divided into 3 main sections: raw bar, dishes and drinks. I ordered the lobster poutine, signature lobster roll and surf and turf steak tartare. I regret passing up their rock lobster Caesar- it has a Nova Scotia lobster tail in it! Next time...

The food came out reasonable quick, and I gotta say, everything was amazing. The poutine was the best poutine I ever had. Perfect fries, great gravy and squeaky cheese all under a mound of lobster. The lobster roll was equally good, not too saucy/mayo-ey, lobster was present and flavors weren't muted, bun was soft and toasty. Surf and turf tartare was my first foray into tartare and it was tasty. Mustard dressing, beef and chunks of lobster, all went well on the complimenting potato chips. 

This dinner was the highlight of my night. It made me so happy. I didn't know what expect from Rock Lobster Food co. I thought it was going to be expensive and not filling. However, on the contrary, it was reasonably priced and satisfied my appetite.

I loved it. I had no complaints. Great food, good people and fun atmosphere- what else do you want from a seafood shack?",2013-05-07 16:00:14

Must endorse the San Danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do NOT forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. The Diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. The crust here is right up there with Terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

I stumbled upon this very unassuming place about 15 years ago when I  worked near by. At the time a good portion of 'cha su' and streamed rice was a 5er$.
FFWD to 2007 and my new BF (still my BF) lives not far at 7 & Yonge. Ya! Lost and found. I'm a kid of immigrant retauranteurs and we would go every Sunday downtown for 'real' Chinese food when I was a kid.
I only get the cha su, not into duck and just haven't tried the crunchy skin pork that looks juicy and amazing.

Here are the facts:
What its NOT:

no atmosphere, not a 'nice' place to stay and eat
absolutely NO FRILLS
despite the sign (I laugh every time) it is NOT FAST, they have ONE speed,(never gets further than first gear)
 one person cutting the meat and I know that will never change
service is not all smiley, basic to the point but not rude
be prepared to wait in line, bring a novel, lol

What it IS

best Chinese bbq I've ever had in my life
they've been around a LONG time, which tells you there's a reason and the long line ups  of my other Asian kin is also very telling (we are a very picky sort;)
I wish I wish they had a veg I could have to with my rice n pork - maybe one day

I usually get 2 lbs and 1 lb is gone a couple hours when it gets in the door between the 2 of us. it's fresh and delicious.
I don't care about the price (which, according to my frugal mom is so expensive!) haha

Just go get the food, take it home, be patient in line.

This is much higher than the 16-18% typically charged for large groups at more upscale places then this, and more importantly, this policy was not communicated to us earlier when the reservation was initially made.

2) As already mentioned in several prior reviews, this place refuses to serve you water in a cup - if you want water, you're required to buy a bottle, even if you ordered beer/other drinks as well. I read about this unusual policy before coming, so I was not surprised like other customers have been - still a turnoff when this place refuses to offer what literally 99.9% of other restaurants do.

3) The server offered me the option of fries, sweet potato fries, or poutine to accompany my burger - it was stated exactly like that, as though they were all standard side options. I literally asked her ""oh, I can have poutine instead of regular fries??"" and was excited when she confirmed yes. Never did the server mention that I would be charged a $5 ""upgrade fee"" for the poutine - I only found this out when I received the bill. 

4) Although I didn't order the Yelp burger special, I saw that the burgers served to other customers didn't come quite as advertised (no mozzarella). Part of the reason I didn't order the special is because it sounded more plain when the waitress listed ingredients than I remembered it described on Yelp - after another in our group checked the Binge Week page, it confirmed that Liberty Burgers just kind of decided to omit the mozzarella after the fact (probably the most expensive topping on an already relatively plain burger compared to other Burger Week offerings). 

5) The server dropped two of those bottles of water on me. It was an accident, but still had to mention it though haha. 

FOOD:

The food itself was decent, and I liked how they gave us frosted glasses to share our pitchers. Although the fries in the poutine were a bit cold, and tasted somewhat stale for some reason, the cheese was pretty good (oh THERE'S the mozzarella!). All together though, the ""Canuck burger"" I ordered (bacon, cheese, mushrooms) was not worth the $18 before tax, especially since the poutine had less fries then the standard side. Had I known there would be an extra charge stealthily slipped in, I would have just ordered a full order of poutine plus a single burger for a few dollars LESS then what I paid. 

ATMOSPHERE:

I had actually previously passed by this place, and peeked in quickly before walking away - the exterior looks slightly more dingy and dive-ish than the dark/cramped interior, which is why I'm so surprised at some of this place's high prices. This is no upscale place...

VERDICT:

The mediocre food aside, my gripes with this place have nothing to do with being ""cheap"" or ""Asian,"" as another reviewer (possibly affiliated with Liberty Burgers) somewhat racistly implied. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of integrity in this place's business practices, where many policies and staff miscommunications appear to exist just to deceive and/or price-gouge customers. Nobody wants to feel cheated - I will most definitely NOT be back.",2015-11-06 02:10:01

Service:  1.5 stars
Care for patrons:  0 star  (I will explain this later)

I finally got around to visiting Casa Imperial for a Monday afternoon dim sum.  I was hoping to host a party here for my daughter's first birthday for 50+ guests and needed to check it out before sending out RSVPs.  Since I did not want to schlep out to Markham with an 11 month old in tow, I called them with some basic questions first.  In this phone inquiry, I was told that their ""private dining room"" could accomodate 50+ guests.  A BIG FAT LIE.  Yes, they have a small private dining room but it can barely seat 25 guests comfortably.  Instead, we were told upon arrival that that they could make the entire 2nd flr available for us which opens to the rest of the dining area.  This is not the same as having your own room where your event can be closed off to the rest of the restaurant.  I did not appreciate that they were outright deceitful over the phone to get me to come in to their restaurant and they did not hesitated to do this when I told them that I would be coming in with a small baby.  This is the short explanation for the 0 star for ""care for patrons"" rating above.  Oh yeah, that and their laughable ""change table"" for my little one.  Anyone interested in exploring this further, you can send me a message.

So here we were.  4 adults and a baby (11 months old) on a Monday afternoon...arriving around 11:30 and the parking lot was packed!  Already a bad sign.  I'm sure they will not have adequate parking available for my party guests on a Saturday if the place is this jammed on a Monday.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was not amused to see the once beautiful Devonsleigh Place turned into this garish operation.  Gone were the old world charm and understated opulence of the former restaurant and what I found in its place was an ill-fitting juxtaposition of a noisy, wanna-be-high end Chinese restaurant.  All the servers were dressed in formal attire in attempt to convey attention to detail and class but they did not know how to address guests properly and this became painfully evident when we had to ask for a high chair twice and still wait some 15 min to get it.  And to top it all off, they sat us at the farthest corner of the second floor dining room when they could clearly see that my mother in law was walking with a cane.  Sigh....

Between the 4 adults, we tried a healthy variety of dishes off their dim sum menu and I must say, the food was good.  Here is a quick run down of our food experience:  Shark's fin soup tad too salty for my taste, Beef shumai moist and well seasoned, Steamed chicken with black fungus and orange daylily was one of our favorites with juicy (but boney) morsels of well seasoned chicken cooked in lotus leaf.  Chicken feet, baked abalone & chicken pie, crispy taro dumpling, crispy bean curd roll, fried turnip cake were all good, as expected.  However, the tripe was too chewy and tough.  Perhaps my favorite thing about their dim sum was the milk and papaya puff.  These cute flaky pastry beauties held creamy, milky custard filling studded with pieces of papaya.  I almost wanted to order more to bring them home.  All this came to $75 including tax and tip.   Not bad at all.  

After a mixed dining experience of good food and bad everything else, I have decided that Casa Imperial is not where I would like to have my daughter's first birthday after all.  I can put up with bad service if I'm on my own but I refuse to subject my guests to it and Casa Imperial's laughable ""change table"" for my guests with babies.  As for  vising Casa Imperial again, sure....I would drop in if I'm back in the area but I will not go out of my way to eat there any time soon.

When I called the restaurant to let them know that I will not be holding my party there, the manager (older Chinese gentleman whose name I will not mention here) was extremely rude on the phone.  His exact response was, ""whatever, I don't care"" before promptly hanging up on me without even asking why.  If Casa Imperial really wants to be high end, they have a lot to learn about genuinely caring for their patrons and providing much better service than just putting on a uniform and buying a Victorian mansion.",2014-02-06 14:10:55

Not that it stopped me from ordering a second slice.

We also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good. The serve a bowl of the mixed up toppings with a generous portion of toasted crostini.

She finally finishes her call and acknowledges me. I complete the required paperwork. I go to bring it to her and she is on another call with a patient. She saw me walk up with my paperwork and place it on the counter in front of her. Another person walks in, she ends her call and proceeds to help the next person, after taking all her info she stands up and says to me ""why didn't you tell me you completed your paperwork"". I did not even answer her as I knew I would have been rude. She calls me up, tells me I have to pay completes the transaction. I sit back down. The lady from back calls me back.

OK, I know medicines and diagnosis are not easy to spell but seriously, I was getting pretty annoyed at this. Plus all the while she is sniffling, I was already sick and the last thing I need is for it to get worse. 
The Doctor came in a few minutes later, and says hello and says you have the flu. Alrighty then, I could have told her that myself. that is why I have not gone anywhere till today. She finally says well let me take a look, we are talking about my headaches, she says well I can't diagnosis headaches, you should to to the ER for a cat scan. That was it for me. A cat scan for the flu. She tells me to rest for two more days she will give me a note for my employer. Pick up the note up front. I get back to the front ask for my note.

I honestly could not take another minute of this so called urgent care. I said i do not need the note and left. I do not need the note. I do not call in to work, so I am not worried.

I really like the decor as well as the staff at La Comida. Everyone was really friendly and the service was excellent, but I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I ordered the Red Snapper for $22 and it over cooked on the outside and covered in salt and pepper. One of my friends said it best: ""if you think it's salty, it must have been really salty"". I eventually scraped all the salt and pepper off the fish and managed to choke it down with help from my iced tea. I thought the Cheese Fundido was a bit flavorless so I asked my friends what they thought about the meal before I wrote this review. It sounds like I'm not the only one in the group that didn't think the food was note worthy so I decided to write an honest review. The chips and salsa were ""meh"" and the Guacamole dip was even more ""meh"".

FrKOpPTvt3w5wRTouOOA8Q,F-1ClQ8bSEp2T7NSnVYNRA,cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg,1,1,1,1,"So this place just earned themselves a 1-star update, and it's a complete shame too. Service was always good to adequate, and I looked past that because of the food, but tonight was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. 

First, the gal who seated us puts us right next to the kitchen entrance in the dining area, the noisiest booth in the entire restaurant, even though the place was 1/2 empty at the time. Nothing like having to repeat yourself to your dinner date every-other-sentence because people in back are continually dropping off piles of plates and smashing things together and, generally, making enough racket to wake the dead. Someone finally brings chips and salsa, but we've still got no drinks and no server. I guess I'm supposed to take it down dry, right? Eventually someone shows up and we get our drink order in. No apology for the wait, naturally. 

After waiting slightly more than usual, our entrees come out. We went to town, all the while consciously saving room for some dessert (sopapillas for the win, right?). To her credit, the server did check on us to ensure the food was ok, albeit not until we had about half way finished the meal. Had there been a problem, it would have been a long wait. I know what you're thinking at this point. You're asking yourself what the big deal was and how this was some service disaster. In fairness, I didn't see it coming either, but stick with me for a bit longer!

So with our entrees done, as in pushed away, covered with a napkin, cutlery crossed on the plate, we began our anxious wait for the sopapillas. The first step was ordering them, which when the server finally came to collect the plates (also after too long) we did. And so begins the waiting game without end. 

At 10 minutes in, still to sopapillas, but I counted up to 6 different staffers, including at least one manager, futzing with the tables next to us. Talking while standing right next to us, as if the plate dropping, chair moving, table dragging was not enough. There's nothing like trying to sit in silence at the table while having some chic's rear end inches from your face while she and some other mental midget try to figure out if they have enough chairs. Between all these people, they still managed to put more plates on the table than they had chairs. While this is going on, a woman walked up to one of them and said she needed a server. She described him physically, with enough detail to pick him up out of a police lineup (age, height, hair color, glasses.. seriously!) and someone went looking for him while she returned grumpily to her table. 

We're now 15 minutes in. Still no sopapillas. Futzing with the table is continuing, but then suddenly the manager and staffers helping with this decide on a new plan. Each table and all the chairs are slowly, noisily moved to the other side of the dining area. That's right, all the racket and hassle was for naught. Still no sign of our server or our dessert. A chip guy comes by and asks us if we want more chips, mistaking us for someone that just got seated. I explain we would like the dessert we ordered and asked if he could help figure out what happened. He leaves, never to be seen again. 

At the 20 minute mark, a completely different chip guy wanders up and asks if we'd like more chips. I tell him about the ordeal and previous chip guy and tell him to get a manager so we can get our bill and leave, because we don't want the dessert anymore. He obliges. While we're waiting, we get another red flag. Remember the woman who was trying to track down her server? Yeah so she wanders up to the area behind the fountain, where the kitchen entrance is, just beneath the ""Employees Only"" sign. This lady literally yells, while waving her arms, ""We need a server out here!"" Wow. O.o

At the 25 minute mark, chip guy #2 came through and a manager arrived at our table. Clearly no clue what the problem was, he opens with the standard, ""Is there a problem?"" line. I explain our ordeal and he asks me who the server was, and of course I don't recall her name (he's the manager, shouldn't he know who is serving this table?). I told him I don't want the dessert, just bring the bill. A few moments later he returns will the bill, sans sopapillas, and apologizes. Nothing else was comped, naturally. 

About 5 minutes later, our server shows up with sopapillas and a backhanded apology. See, she goes on about how she asked someone else to help out and take care of us. It's your table, you own the service. If you entrust our care to some brain donor who drops the ball, it's still on you. She cashed us out and we walked out, leaving less than 10% for the tip and all the sopapillas behind. We didn't touch them for two reasons. 1) On principle, as we said we no longer wanted them and 2) They looked disgusting, long and skinny, darker than usual color and just.. wrong.

Sweetie and I split a She Crab Soup and once it came we were immediately sorry we didn't get our own bowls.  It was delightful and rivaled any She Crab that I've had in the ""big"" seafood areas like Charleston.  It was creamy, well seasoned, and quite honestly soul saving.

I ordered the Diver Scallops and Sweetie had the Sea Bass.  Scallops were big and Gordon Ramsey would have been proud at the preparation.  Bouncy, yet firm and covered with a pickled something or other and a house made sriracha rounded it out.  OMG, the sriracha was perfect and added a nice kick to the dish.  Sweetie is a virtual Sea Bass Connoisseur and said it was the best she's ever had.....a statement not to be taken lightly!  We shared a chocolate torte for dessert and called it a night.

Where do I start this time? Coming back for seconds, I think I can put a solid score for this place, no bias or discrepancies. The first time I had the cheese burger, fries and beer and I was not entirely impressed. This time I had the Central Park, something that's supposed to scream ""quality"" over the regular cheese burger (I would assume the quality be served to me whether I ordered something expensive or cheap?). Like I said before, this burger did not impress me. It had a relatively thick patty, but considered thin if this place was all about the gourmet burgers. The patty was slightly overcooked, but most of it was covered by the onion ring, blue cheese and sautÃ©ed mushrooms so it's hard to tell in the picture. It was juicy in some spots but dried out in some. The fries, though it came out nice and golden, was still overcooked just like my first visit. I also ordered my beer to wash down the food, so that was the best part. I keep thinking in my head, I paid $16 for the burger alone.. With beer around $20 not including taxes + gratuities. Is this what a gourmet burger combo/meal is supposed to be?

The most unfortunate part of my visit is the realization that I made a mistake by coming here again instead of driving further north and dine at The King's Landing or Main Street Burger Shoppe in Stouffville. Not to mention they don't charge serving water. Even if they did charge for water, it'll be a dollar less. It's not a problem with me bc I like my burger with beer anyway.

Main, dry ages bone in rib eye, american wagyu rib cap, of course a5 japanese wagyu enhanced with grilled foie gras, king crab or just top any steak with foie gras butter. Why not? 

Sides spicy zucchini, smoked mushrooms and bone marrow.

I like sushi, but my experiences at such restaurants all seem to blur together.  This may speak to how average most are, but only two in the region have ever stuck out.  The first is Sushi Ken, located along Chandler Blvd in Ahwatukee.  I'll save that for another review but, if you have the opportunity, be sure to check it out.

The other is Yasu.  My wife and I had an impromptu dinner here a few weeks back and very much enjoyed it.  We actually had one order of California roll as an appetizer and the first quality I noticed was how fresh it tasted, much unlike the kind that comes in a plastic carton from Basha's.  Upgrade.  The accompanying miso soup had a striking taste without being overwhelming.

For our entree, we shared the rib eye steak.  The steak itself was nice and tender but the highlight were the included dipping sauces.  Delicious!

The restaurant itself is a little cramped for my liking, but it has a very cool, laid-back vibe.  The sushi chefs were busy chatting up a couple at the bar, talking about their favorite items on the menu and just making it feel even more pleasant.

If you do go to the buffet, the food will be 2 1/2 to 3 star at best, and compares with most chinese buffets at any other place though with a pretty decent dessert buffet as well.
Being the largest, I never have problems finding a table for dim sum, and throughly enjoy the food.  Broken into 3 parts, 1 fixed station for the most popular steamed items, 1 fixed station for the most popular fried items, and the traditional mobile carts comprising the 3rd part, dim sum is efficient, fast and fresh.  
In groups of 6 or more, their set menu dinners are fantastic.  At a value of 20-30 a person, a group can have a feast of 7-10 dishes, all freshly made to delight friends and all.  
One special note, it's probably the best chinese place in Calgary that can accomodate private groups from as few as 10 to as many as hundreds.  Plenty of small private rooms and even a dance floor with a stage for a live band.",2012-04-29 04:20:44

The interior of the place has a Japanese feel to it, creating a wonderful atmosphere. In addition to the interior, they played various Japanese songs the whole time! 

Upon looking at the menu, I saw that they have various Japanese dishes such as Hayashi Rice, variations of hamburg steak, Curry (Vegetable, Beef, and Chicken), as well as various pasta dishes. Besides the items on the menu, there are daily specials listed on a whiteboard. 

I decided to order the yuzu soda ($5) , since many other yelpers have suggested it. I had no idea what to expect, so my first sip was definitely a surprise. The flavor was definitely unique, but tasted great. At the bottom of the glass there are yuzu rinds, which add to the great, light flavor of the drink.

For an appetizer I decided to order a Potato Korokke ($3.50). The Korokke was a perfect golden brown color and looked very appetizing! The dipping sauce, which I'm pretty sure was the same as the tonkatsu sauce, complemented the Korokke perfectly! Upon my first bite, I was amazed at how perfect the crispy breading tasted along with the potato. I definitely recommend trying this, but be sure to let it cool because it is very hot upon serving ( I burned my mouth because it was too delicious to put down !).

After that, I decided to try the curry katsu ($11). The breading on the katsu was perfect and had just the right amount of sauce to make it flavorful, without taking any flavor away from the curry. The curry was a spicy chicken curry that I would not recommend to anyone who can't handle anything but mild. It is pretty spicy, so be sure you can handle it before ordering. 

For dessert I decided to try their chocolate parfait ($7). The chocolate parfait consisted of whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, crushed wafers (almost like a crushed ice cream cone), a couple pieces of chocolate candy, and two cookie sticks (they are rolled paper thin wafers with chocolate in the middle). The parfait was absolutely delicious, definitely a must have if you love sweets.

I loved that this PT's had a crazy diverse playlist. Any bar that plays ""Stillborn"" by Black Label Society is fine by me. There's quite a few pool tables here and even shuffleboard! Service throughout the night was great. Employees cleared empty glasses from our table multiple times by the pool tables and asked if we needed anything else. As midnight approached, we were handed small cups of champagne and party favors.

This is in the former Casa Colombia restaurant that recently went out-of-business.  In the Food Lion supermarket strip shopping enter along Hwy 521 in Indian Land.

Very popular with the Latino population which was there in droves.  Entire families eating in as well as taking out.  Sides included sweet and green plantains, rice and beans and other Central and South American items.  There were also some conventional sides, such as potatoes, rice and string beans.

The chicken, to us, was nothing special.  It was grilled and nicely cooked and coated with a mildly spicy treatment.  But it was expensive, especially compared to grocery store chicken and the Colonel's and we would call it rather blah.  Overall, it rated an A-OK rating of three stars. And that is all.

The serving and cooking crew appeared to be Colombian which I verified by asking the cashier in Spanish.  Hence the sides offered. 

If you plan on eating inside, it is crowded.  Metal tables fill the entry/eating area.  You order and pick-up at the counter..Menu is on the wall above the cashiers and there are printed cards that  you can use or take with you.  It is very clean and the staff are neatly uniformed, groomed and friendly as well as helpful.

Very simple operation and other than the grilled chicken there are salads and empanadas (meat with potato stuffed pies).  And certainly, there are beverages.  Don't understand how it is ""gourmet"" chicken.  It is just grilled.

I wish them success, and given the Latino population in the area it stands a good chance.  That said, the menu is limited and the sides are unusual for the non-Latino population of Indian Land.  Couple that with the higher prices charged, and they might be making some menu and price changes.",2017-09-20 19:25:02

With Firecreek, after speaking with the roaster, you can tell their serious about their beans.  Not only is the coffee solid, but they have a great variety of loose leaf teas; my favorite was their mint tea.

The inside was clean and simple.  It's great to sit inside because there's a lot of natural light pouring in. Sitting outside is nice too.  I think this is one of the perks of going to restaurants and coffee shops in Cave Creek/Carefree; you get away from the artificial ""Pleasantville"" feel of most of the prettyfied places of the PHX metro area.  Places like Arcadia Farms in Scottsdale and Nobuo downtown are some exceptions.

Their baked goods here are delightful and fresh.  The breakfast burrito is pretty good also.  What's nice is the chef really wants to make the customer happy and is willing to change things up for you.  Not that you want to be the pain who asks for a gizillion substitutions, but it's nice to know if you have a friend who's a vegetarian, the chef is flexible.

We walked up to the counter to order.  No one greeted us.  There were 5 employees standing in front of us.  One was making two burritos for himself it seems like.  They were just chatting to each other.  The guy who made our food had his hands all over counters and on his apron and pockets.  Didn't wash his hands by the way before making our food. 
 The food....brown rice was served raw, not cooked al dente... not even close.  Meat were dried and lack of seasoning.  Same goes to their expensive guacamole.  Everything was super bland the last time we came here.  

FYI, they're charging the 3 tacos differently now.  We always order 3 tacos, 2 carnitas and 1 steak with guacamole.  They charged use individually for the tacos with individual guacamole charges of .75 cents... $1.95 is the regular charge with your meal, now it's $2.25 because they charged me like this.  We eat Chipotle often, I remember guacamole around $1.25 or so.  This is ridiculous.  They should tell people to get it in the container, it's $1.95.  They should have only charged us for the $1.95 as a one time courtesy since I said something.  They're too cheap to make a regular customer happy. 

We still came here after the e. coli breakout.  That must say something, but after seeing how dirty it is here.  I don't know anymore.  I don't want to get sick.  The condiment bar is dirty and empty napkin holders and lids.  Trash cans are overflowing.

Tried the baked oyster for the first time and it was pretty good! The sauce was creamy and there was lots of goodies in there, not just some random veggies. And I love the Kinoko bibimbap, there's just something about hot melted cheese!  

In terms of desserts I think that almond tofu and sesame soy milk pudding was just not worth the price. For the same price elsewhere you can get a whole bucket full and it's really nothing special.

Previous visits were a 15min wait. 

A steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their order and they all greeted the owner by name so I guess they are regulars. Another thing I noticed was that a customer that came in and ordered 15mins after me received her order before me so I don't know if she received special treatment because she's a regular or that my pizza just took longer to cook lol. 

The pizza here have always been perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and this time it was no different. The wings on the other hand were disappointing and lacking. They were on the smaller end and for a couple dollars more, I would rather get wings at All Stars.

The instant you walk in, the layout feels like you are in a island tiki bar. Great service and we met the owner/chef. The daily special is written in a chalkboard which is located near every 50 ft of each table. 

Lobster Pho - Mkt price at $40. It was literally presented with a whole lobster over a bed of pho. The lobster meat was already deboned. The broth was fairly light in flavor and hearty. I ate the extremely spiced shrimp prior to consuming the lobster pho, therefore it was difficult for me to truly taste the pho.  It was good, but not mouth watering amazing. I probably won't order this in the future. It was a good experience and plain cool to try a lobster pho once in a lifetime. 

Oxtail Pho - It was a very generous portion of oxtail with pho. Once again, the beef broth was very light in flavor and in color. I've had oxtail where the soup was very thick and oily from the oxtail. I would order it again. 

razor clam - It was seasoned and stir fry, then it was placed back in the razor clam in a sizzling dish. One of my favorite dish and very tasty!!

Shrimp with the District One special sauce - Sorta of like the shrimp from Hot n Juicy, but served in a plate and nicer presentation. The shrimp was a good size (bigger then hot n juicy) and the sauce was mild spicy and bit tangy. Will definitely order it again.

Combo plate with Short rib with fried egg and kimchi - nothing special, it's good and average like any other good platter. The Short rib was tender and had a charcoal taste to it.

Fish taco - hamachi sashimi with avocadom, cilantro, cherry tomatoe - Comes with 3 tacos that is about 2 bitesize. The fish was very fresh! Good flavor. 

Beef on asaparagus - pretty presentation with a large portion of beef wrapped on a full size stalk of asaparagus. Very generous portion and the meat was tender and tasty. 

Things I want to try in the future: the oxtail rice, belly bun, and slow braised pork belly in young coconut juice.

Overall, the menu sounds very appealing and this is a very casual joint for an asian fusion cuisine. It's reasonably priced.",2015-01-18 15:46:52

Meineke has all three, the necessary hoist to lift duelly wheels, the clearance in their bay after they lift a vehicle that is already over 8 feet, and lift that can accommodate the duelly wheels.  If they did not have that, well, Meineke also still has 2 oil change pits.  

Meineke was willing to use my parts. though they charge MORE for labor $138/hr, for customer-provided parts, vs. $125/hr for store provided parts, cos they are not making $ on the parts if I bring my own.  

I also needed a rush job because I was leaving town for 2 week vacation in this camper and Meineke could do it ""today"".  I left my truck there and they gave me a ride to my other car, to look for the parts.

Randy took great care of me, he made my ""worries and concerns"" disappear many times, and not with empty words.  He came through on all his words with actions.  When the U-joints that were supposed to fit my truck, were too large, Randy really hustled to help me find the right part and had several U-joints sent to their shop, but they were also the wrong ones.  I finally found the right size U-joint by taking the old one they removed to Advanced Auto Parts (FKA Carquest), and they had the right one, so I was able to get the 2 hour job done that same day.

Since the repair, I drove that truck about 400 miles and the repair feels great.    

This store has a relatively new owner since about a year ago, and Randy has been at this location about 1 year, too.   The employees speak highly of their new owner.  They told me the previous owner only gave ""Christmas bonuses"" only to certain employees, but the current owner gave bonuses to everyone, even the low level employees.  He also hosted BBQs  for the employees after the shop closed, while the previous owner did not do that, and the new owner comes to the shop a lot more often.  

So I hope my 5 star review will help improve their rather poor reviews, which on the date wrote this one, is only 2.5 stars. I see that much of 1 star reviews come from the previous management.

Overlook those scary poor reviews from the past, and take a risk and come here and try them out.  Randy will do his best to take care of you!  He is so upbeat, cheerful, and ""diligent"" !!!  The new owner is very lucky to have Randy as his service writer.",2018-02-23 22:18:00

A year later, my love for Pittsburgh, my date, and Harris is unwavering. I've gone to Harris about twice a month on average since, whether it's because friends or family are in town and I want to go someplace that's both fun and has an approachable menu; because it's 11 p.m. and I need to go someplace where the kitchen's still open yet it isn't overwhelmed with a party crowd; or because I want to enjoy happy hour food paired with an extensive beer list.


I haven't been dazzled by everything on the menu, but I generally think the food is good to very good for the price and atmosphere. The only thing I really haven't liked there was the ""Lasagne Aubergine,"" or eggplant lasagna, which I thought was too salty and generally unappealing the one time I had it.

On the ""okay"" list: chicken quesadilla (also a bit too salty), spinach dip, and tots

Good: pierogies, vegetarian chili, Jamaican jerk wings, and macaroni and cheese

Very good: ""The Clogbuster"" (what I consider to be a real salad, not some pathetic bar ""salad"" with a bunch of fatty things atop two pieces of iceberg lettuce--this one has a bunch of root vegetables, peppers, et cetera)

Love: turkey burger, ""Macaronis et Fromagede Langoustine"" (seafood mac and cheese), and dry-rub bacon wings


The Harris staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive (even during busy times that are typical of nights, weekends, and happy hours). The bar really isn't big enough for the kind of crowd it draws, and it can get pretty packed and noisy, but when the patio's open, it helps relieve some of that crowdedness.

I got 2 Zegna Suits when I was here for 70% off which was a great find! I wish they did the alterations here, but I brought them to a local tailor to get them properly fitted. You really cannot complain when you get $1500-$1700 suits for $420-$580 each! 

I looked around a bit for some shirts and things but I am a bigger guy so I need tall clothes and they have lots of normal little guy stuff here.

Asking drinks and delivering orders inside and out of the place, with no hair net or hat to hold her long hair back. She constantly moved her hair back with her hands  and or would touch her face and then go back to what she was doing. Never wore gloves nor washed her hands after touching her face or hair or even when she would go in and out of the front door, grabbing the handle.

She spent majority of the time on my back in one specific area and went hardcore. She also popped my neck and put my arms and legs in weird positions that popped my entire spine. How's that even possible?! Anyways, super intense massage and I felt amazing afterwards. 

Con: just one. The price! We went in thinking it's around $30 an hr like many other Chinese owned spas but this place costed $60/hour per person! That's so much for a massage spa on spring mountain... We usually tip at least $20 per person but since this place is super expensive already, my boyfriend tipped $15 a person and paid a total of $150.

This was our meal on the way out of the desert.  6 hours later I'm still drooling just thinking about how great it was!

I went with a quad of encased meats.  I got an Italian Sausage, a Bratwurst, a White Hot, and a jumbo All Beef Hot Dog.  Yes that is a lot of dogs...and yes they were all devoured in record time.  I got a loganberry shake and my wife got some fries and a chocolate shake.  Total damage was like $23.00 or so.

In order of greatness.

1.  Italian Sausage-  These things are great.  Still the best Italian Sausage I have ever had.  Got this one topped with mustard and onions.  Delicious, spicy, flavorful etc.  It was a great sausage.
2.  Bratwurst-  Topped with mustard and onion.  Similar texture to the Italian but more smoky and less spicy.  A fantastic sausage.
3.  White Hot-  Its a mix of veal, pork and beef.  Its a plump sausage with a white color.  I got that topped with mustard and onions also.  This one didn't have as much flavor as the other 2 but it was still excellent.
4.  Jumbo Beef Dog-  This one I got topped with mustard, onions, relish and their hot sauce.  It was a huge plump all beef dog.  It was bigger and thicker than any of the sausages.  It was great as well but I would have preferred another Italian or Brat instead of this thing....and that's saying something.....ALL of their hot dogs/sausages here are great....some are just greater than others.

Fries-  Real crispy shoestring fries.  They were perfect. 

Shakes-  Loganberry.  Delicious!  Not too sweet and a perfect consistency to suck through the straw.  A tad small, but it was only like $2.00 so that's understandable. 

People in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale sure are lucky.  This is the only Teds outside of upstate NY.  There should be more of these.  They are some great hot dogs and are some of the best I have ever had.  I will continue to come to AZ just for these things.  These hot dogs/sausages are THAT GOOD!",2012-07-16 01:15:05

:King West:

It seems that I am on an 'eat at unidentifiable' restaurant phase. Last Saturday was Bremner (see tomorrow's post) in Montreal and today was Buca. If you're not looking for it, you will miss it. It's next to Cheval. In fact, they share the same alleyway. 

Buca was exactly what I thought it would be.  A clean space with simple details. Special shout out to their light fixture, I loved it.  As those who reviewed before me pointed out, Buca used to be boiler house and you can still see that. It's very industrial with huge ceilings. It's actually basement level but they've opened it up so that a lot of light can shine through. 

The lunch menu was pretty extensive, and priced average for King West. I hear they vary their lunch menu, although there are few constants, such as the rosemary, garlic bread knots.

Service was slow to start, but got stellar and stayed that way throughout our long lunch.  

Olive Ascolane - fried olives stuffed with lamb sausage - crunchy, salty and tangy.

Pizza, sadly, I don't remember what this was called, but it had smoked buffalo cheese, chilies, and the day's cured meats.  It was spicy, salty, and smoky.
 
Bigoli - homemade pasta with duck egg and a duck ragÃ¹ with mascarpone and basil.  OMG. I loved this dish. The portion is small, but lest we forget, we on King West.  Course if it were a little bigger, I would say I superloved it. 

And of course, dessert:

Pannacotta with kiwi berries. KIWI BERRIES?!?! I Googled it because I've never heard of such a thing, much less tasted such a thing. I had to know more. Their proper term is actinidia arguta, or hard kiwi. Apparently it is native to Korea (amongst other countries). They are really delicious, and I think I love them. 

It was a proper pannacotta. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered it at a restaurant and been served messed up pudding. This was creamy, delicately flavoured and delicious. 

The tart tasted exactly how it smelled - amazing.  Sweet gelati, maple syrup and pistachios added textures to the delicate tart and pumpkin filling.

If I had to choose the best dish of the day, I would go with the bigoli and the pannacotta.  The bread knots are also well-known but I think I want to try the pig ears next time. 

Word of warning, Buca doesn't serve complimentary bread, which may be why people like the knots so much. If you have to pay for bread, why not getting something more creative.",2011-10-27 21:06:24

Incidentally i was in the main Chinatown plaza (for the haircut) and decided to come here for lunch. I got lucky and found parking like right in front of the restaurant (everyone knows parking sucks in this complex). After i went into the restaurant, all the side tables were occupied. The waiter asked if I would be willing to sit in the big table in the middle with others, and i was fine with that. 

Fastest lunch ever. I was in and out of the restaurant in like 15 - 20 minutes. This was about 0100PM on a Monday afternoon. I was sat at my seat, given the menu, gave my order of the Piquant Intestine Noodle with extra noodle, got my food, ate, and gone. 

Like the menu picture shows, the Piquant Intestine Noodle gives you some bak choy, piquant intestine, and noodles. Very simple but flavorful noodle soup. Not sure what piquant intestine means but from my experience in eating intestines, it was like, mini large intestines. I had wished they had used normal sized large intestines as they are much ""meatier"". The soup base at a ""normal spiciness"" is pretty decent. Had a good amount of ""ma"" and ""la"" which is the numb and spicy aspects of chongqing/sichuan cuisine but was not overpowering so i was able to eat my noodles fast. Price wise, it was great. I think my bowl of noodles were $8.99. With a free 100g side of extra noodles, it was a good amount of food for my hungry self, since i haven't really ate since 0630AM that morning. Not sure if it was because i was able to eat much faster than i did last time (not status post night of drinking and dehydration), the noodles didn't really soak up the soup as much as it did last time. 

Service was quick. Unfortunately they didn't refill my cup of mung bean soup. Since the ""visit"" was so fast, it didn't really bother me too much.

I don't miss many things about living in the bay, but getting my dim sum fix once a month or so is one of them.
I had my office on Market St. and I had a Yank Sing in the alley right behind my building...I could go for dim sum at lunch, let the dishes pile up and waddle back to my office for nice long afternoon nap:)
If I felt more ambitious, I could walk up to Chinatown to Delicious, New Fortune and Yong Kee for some of the most remarkable food this side of Hong Kong!
It was especially pleasant when we got 4-5 of us to go, and just sit and talk and eat for couple of hours...the art of dim sum:)
With that in mind, I headed out for the near reaches of Chandler this past Saturday.
Jim and Audrey W. organized a dim sum outing at the Phoenix Palace Buffet (I frankly didn't notice the buffet...I'm sure it was there and very good...I was just too busy pointing at bamboo steamers and bowls and plates and saying ""give me that one please"":)
Jim organized the outing after fellow Yelper Helen Y had noted that this place had changed ownership, chefs, etc., and is now quite good! (I now have 2 things to be grateful to Helen Y. for...helping us find good dim sum in greater Phoenix and allowing me to become a citizen of the Republic of Sweet:)
We were joined on our outing by Kevin H (in an interesting side note, Kevin got ROTD for...Phoenix Palace Buffet on the exact same day that we went for dim sum!!! What are the odds!?:), Marian H. and Dottsy Z. 
The Beautiful Carin wasn't able to make it...she had a little stomach bug and stayed in bed:( 
I was going to stay home and take care of her, but the lure of potentially good dim sum was too great!:)
Off I went with cheery wave and a lilting ""feel better"" hanging in the air as the door slammed before she changed her mind and asked me to stay around and nurse her back to health:) She's a strong girl...I knew she would pull through:)
Boy, am I glad I went!
The company and conversation were wonderful...everyone cheered me up about having to leave my better half at home (and as anyone who knows us will attest, Carin really is the better half...maybe the better 75%:)
It was a perfect dim sum afternoon! 
We talked, pointed at the carts, ate, talked and ate, talked and ate:) 
I think dim sum is as much about conversation and relaxation as about the food...but having said that, having great food really adds to both the conversation and relaxation factor of a great dim sum lunch...and the food was remarkable!
It was so good! 
There might be a couple of shops that top this place in SFO, but not by much...it's that good!
We had all the standards, shrimp rolls, pork buns, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice (outstanding sticky rice, BTW).
We had some of the non-standards, tripe, chive dumplings...all delicious and served up with smile!
The service was very good...there were always carts in close proximity, and if you saw something a few tables away and flagged a server down, they always made their way over to help you out:) drinks were refilled promptly, and the empty dishes were moved out to make room for new arrivals.
The biggest surprise came at the end of our lunch...the total for 6 of us was less than $70!!!
I used to spend more than that for dim sum lunch for 2 in SFO (and twice that much in HK)! Amazing!
Jim, thanks for organizing! It was a great lunch with a fun group!
It's great to know where to get my dim sum fix!",2009-05-21 14:29:32

I know, I know, they serve up dishes from so many different parts of Asia, I wouldn't know how to classify Nam's other than Asian Fusion, and they really live up to that name. 

I have been a regular since a couple of years back, where a co-worker and I would go every week before our night meetings for dinner. We have tried every item on the chef's recommendation list. They used to offer complimentary soup and dessert with every meal, I wish they still have that now. I remember the soup made for a great appetizer and till this day I still miss some of the desserts they make. I don't think any of that are on the regular menu so that's sad.

On that what's good currently! They started with Belly Program, you get 5 points per visit, so it's pretty easy to get enough for a free beer or bubble tea (remember to let them know to reduce sugar levels you are not a huge fan of sweet drinks) using Belly Points. Nam's is another wonderful place on campus for noodles and congee. If you are looking for pho downtown, you can go to Nam's. If you're looking for Korean food downtown, you can go to Nam's. Nam's is a good place to go if you and your dining company are looking for different asian varieties. 

As for me I love their congee. It's only $5.50 for a huge bowl. Avocado bubble tea is also one of my favs! They make it using real avocado!! For appetizers I especially love the lemon grass chicken wings.

The soup is quite tasty, the main disappointment is the noodles not being fresh ones. The noodles they use in the pho are the dried varieties.

There are not much ingredients in the noodles though... I guess when you order a bigger size, that's is just more noodles....not more meat.

There are no lunch specials.

And we were looking for a reception spot for a Baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  I was disappointed about the food. The veal parmigiana was sub-par. Too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. My husband tried a pasta dish which was ""ok"" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. The drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste I was hoping to get out of it. The caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. Their tomato sauce - homemade I was told - tastes like something out of a jar. I was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the Italian restaurant across the street. I was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better Italian restaurant in the Garden Basket Plaza that makes everything from scratch and I have been a regular of theirs since they opened.",2014-06-28 00:14:30

Overall service was ok but not great, the food was good, and the decor/ambience was a bit of an enigma.  It was kind of odd that we had to specifically ask for a desert menu as our server was trying to give us the check--almost as if they wanted us out the door!

My only real complaint is that they charge for chips and salsa, and the salsa is relatively mediocre.  In my opinion chips and salsa is such an integral part of eating at a Mexican restaurant I put a lot of weight on it.  It just sets the stage for the meal...and shouldn't be that hard to get right!

I'll give them kudos for the enchiladas as they were cooked well (not too greasy or soggy) and the complimentary valet.  As a whole, Ticoz is a decent option if it's in your hood but I can't imagine going out of my way to eat here again.",2011-02-14 20:18:18

The specials were actually on a small chalkboard which she kept propt up on the seat at the next table for me.  Since I did come for Pho, I got the Pho Tai (ribeye) and the Surf Clams which were a daily special.

The Pho came out first, and in a much larger bowl than I've had in the past. You do get your money's worth for 7.99! No limes available, but the lemon gave it its own interesting flavor. I've only known Pho from the East Coast, and it pales in comparison to this bowl of heaven. Even the noodles were far better. The surf clam came out on its shell, with some garnishes and hot sauce. I'm not certain of the spice because I didn't ask, but it certainly packs a whallop. If you do not deal with spicy foods, I would suggest avoiding this (unfortunately.)

Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty.
Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing.

I went with the Organic Kale Salad. A lot of flavors going on..everything from smoked almonds (yum!) to Aged White Cheddar, to grapefruit and granny smith apples.

To be honest, the grapefruit was just too overpowering - way too much of a sour flavor that collided with everything else. Unfortunately, it kind of ruined the salad for me because as I tried to pick around it, the juices started to get on the rest of what I was trying to eat.

The aged white cheddar was DELICIOUS but came in these ginormous cubes throughout the salad. I wish that it was crumbled so that the flavor was more consistent with each bite instead of just getting an entire mouthful of it all at once.

Hobak has got to be hands down the best Koraen restaurant I've been to to date.  We got the combo for two and all the meats were super high quality.  In this restaurant, the staff actually cook the meats for you and they did a superb job.  Nothing was overcooked, everything was so juicy and delicious.  The sides were great too - we had a green onion / bean sprout salad, daikon, a cold soup, a regular green salad, a marinated bok choy dish and kim chee.  I liked that there were a lot of vegetable options.  I definitely can't wait to come back with more friends.

Normally I am not a fan of ""steakhouses"" so I was pleased that my parents wanted to go to a seafood/steak place for their 35th wedding anniversary. I've been to City Hall in old town for steaks before and have always been pleased, so I think I knew what to expect from Ocean Club.

We arrived and were seated right away (with reservation on a Sunday night). They have a very large bar area (well known in the area as cougar hunting grounds) which looked nice and fully stocked. I think the bar area is actually larger than the dining room. The cocktails on the menu were expensive, far more expensive that the average for the area (approx $20 each), and they weren't that fantastic. But the wine and beer selection was fairly good.

Now, on to the food - We started with oysters which were SO fresh. I am always hesitant eating any seafood in Arizona (or anywhere landlocked) but you could really taste the ocean. Our server informed us that they fly in their seafood daily so ensure freshness. Not good for my global footprint, but I will accept the freshness none the less. Both the boyfriend and I got steak and lobster tail. I got mine with the small filet (6oz) and it was lovely and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the New York cut and seemed to really enjoy it. My father got the Mahi Mahi and also enjoyed it alot, I was surprised at the large portion of the Mahi. They offered to cook it a variety of ways, he chose to have it grilled with lemon. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. The lobster mashed potatoes had huge pieces of lobster in it, but was under seasoned. In fact, everyone put salt on their steak/fish/sides throughout the evening and we aren't big salt eaters. I suppose I would rather my food under salted vs over salted but you'd think when you pay so much money they would get the balance right for you.

All in all, the service was great, the food was good, and we had an enjoyable celebration. This place is very expensive but I'd say it's worth it for a special occasion.",2016-03-07 17:23:53

The first time I went here was to purchase ice cream & some smoothies (from the Orange Julius within the store) with coupons from my Entertainment book. Since I was using two coupons, I thought me and my boyfriend would have to purchase separately. The lady was nice enough to not make it difficult b/c the exception on the coupon did say ""only one per visit or customer"". (I forget since I don't have it anymore.)

My most recent experience was this past week. My sister wanted to order a photo ice cream cake from them for my niece's birthday. She wasn't able to go during the week, so we asked if we could e-mail them the photo with all the necessary information and they were totally fine with it. They were awesome, kept in touch, and the cake turned out great!

My family has ordered three ice cream cakes from this location within the past 6 months and they have tasted like heaven every single time. (We always order the Oreo Cookie & Cream ice cream cake.) They are consistent and I love that I can depend on that. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone ordering an ice cream cake. There is no better place for cakes. TRUST ME! I literally dream about their cakes a night and have withdrawals between my nieces/nephews birthday parties.

We got a scoop of their grape ice cream, which sounds gnarly when you think about it, but when you taste it, it's pretty amazing.  They captured the best part about grape soda and turned it into ice cream.  I'm a convert.  We also had a banana shake and a chocolate shake.

We ordered a $58 combo for dinner.  It consisted of an appetizer, a vegetable dish, a Drunken Rib, and a 2.5lb crab, stir fried ""under bridge"" style (æ©åºè¾£çè¹).  There are many things that I'd like to talk about, so I organize my review in point form:

1) In the menu, it says this combo is for 2 people.  Pure lie.  It easily feeds 3.  

2) The highlight of the combo is the crab.  The crab we had was meaty and sweet, indicating that it was fresh.  I estimated that there was over 1lb of garlic in the dish.  Yet the garlic aroma and spice was not sharp, indicating the garlic slices were dry when they cooked them.  The crab was nicely fried.  There was a delicious coat of flavours on the shell.  Lick it, eat it, whatever, just don't miss it.  This dish had wok air, which is what under bridge spicy crab is famous for.

3) The other thing the under bridge spicy crab is famous for is the spiciness.  Top 1's version didn't taste spicy to me.  It was nowhere as spicy as the dai-pai-dong version.  You should ask for extra spicy if you prefer it hot.

4) The Drunken Ribs were in essence rib bites and taro deep fried in black vinegar.  It had a harden coat on the outside.  It was another wok air dish.  It tasted average, because the meat needed more tenderizing.

5) The vegetable dish in the combo was small.  It was indeed 2-person portion.  

6) Services was minimum considering the price range.  I expected a change of plates, since they were full of crab shells.  Never happened or offered.  When someone did wait on us, s/he was polite, effective and efficient.

7) The bill came with 10% tips added on.  The calculation was clear.  Someone wrote in Chinese that the final amount was ""all in"".  If you cannot read Chinese, you can clarify with a server.

8) I like the interior decoration.  It is a funky mix of batman statue, fortune cat doll, bookshelves, European armour, Chinese emperor attire, owls, and stuff animals.  Consider yourselves forewarned.

The second he heard the noise, he started thrashing wildly, trying to escape, despite being attached by a noose tethered to the washing station. Even though I turned off the dryer almost immediately (as fast as I could while fumbling over the switch), my boy remained out of control, reacting to dryer noises on the other side of the shop.

A number of wonton noodle shops have popped up since, but none of them beats Jim Chai Kee in my opinion. 

The speed of service is quite impressive and reminds me of eateries in Hong Kong. Typically, our order includes a plate of vegetables with oyster sauce ($2.5), which arrives within a minute or two from the time we order. The noodles come shortly after, and we are usually done our meal within 30 to 45 minutes. The broth is clear, light yet full of flavour and always comes pipping hot. The restaurant fills the bowls with soup only 3/4 of the way to avoid overcooking the noodles. In traditional establishments (these are even hard to find in Hong Kong now), wonton noodles are served with a spoon at the bottom of a small bowl, stacked with wontons, and finally topped with noodles to avoid soaking it in the soup for too long. 

There are only 3 toppings available (wontons, sliced beef and dace fish balls) and you can mix and match as you wish ($8 for all 3 toppings, $7 for 2 toppings and $6 for 1 topping). Because the menu is small and concise, the quality is always consistent. I definitely prefer this place over Wonton Chai (Unionville location) as I find that their toppings and broth tend to be on the salty side. Plus, the wontons just aren't as good. As for Wonton Hut (Warden and Hwy 7), I do enjoy their broth, although I find their portions really small and their price points are slightly higher. 

A few things to keep in mind when visiting:
- This place only accepts cash and you will need to bring your bill up to the counter.
- There is a self-serving tea station in the back right corner.
- Uncooked wontons and fish balls are available for sale.",2017-10-02 04:49:58

I came with a group of about 20 people and booked about a month in advance, which I would highly recommend doing, because spots fill up fast. All the staff here are super professional and adept at handling events with large groups and ensuring everyone has fun. For most of the people in my group, it was our first time throwing axes, so the staff gave us tips and pointers and also gave us ample time to practice before starting the ""friendly competition."" Once you've booked the place, you don't even have to worry about anything else. They arrange everything for you, and pair people up randomly for the competition, so you don't even have to worry about a thing, and everyone gets a chance to play like 4 rounds during the round robin part. For some reason they left my friend's name off the list and didn't realize until it came time for her to pay - but they were super nice about the mistake and still let her play like 4 rounds in a row, so she got her money's worth. Paying was also a very smooth process considering the large group.

The staff there really try to make the experience fun for everyone and don't openly judge you, even if you suck like me. They always try to be encouraging, and will celebrate with you when you get a really good throw in. Overall a really cool, chill group of people, but at the same time they know how to do their job and make sure everyone is having a safe time.

Even though I was embarrassingly awful at the actual axe throwing, I still had a ton of fun and would love to come back again! It's an awesome, low-key, stress-relieving activity, and will make you feel super badass :D They have great facilities, so you can bring your own food and drinks, and your party area comes equipped with a fridge and counter.

Being of Persian descent, I know what this food is supposed to taste like. Just the right spices, fresh vegetables and not too much oil. 

One of my all time favorites is GhormÄ Sabzi. Its a Khoresht, which means a stew served over piping hot Basmati rice with a smidgen of Saffron.





Habibs Ghorme Sabzi is FANTASTIC.

Ingredients are top notch. I really like the chef's story (self made man from a diverse background) and the food was delicious. 

Menu is quite small, which is fine, but wow, portions are tiny. I'm ok w tiny portions and big prices if the food is going to blow my mind and satiate me because it's so tasty. Graft is not there. 

As others have said, lower prices or larger portions and I'm there. Look, I'm not asking for sloppy, gross, unrefined Great Dane portions, I'm just asking to leave relatively satiated (not ""full"") after dropping a C note+ for two. 

Drinks are really good, but again, I don't care how good drinks are this isn't NYC so let's take things down just a notch. Keep Wisconsin great with cheap booze. 

Lastly, I get we're all eco and green but NO ONE likes to look at their date under LED spotlights at the bar. NO ONE.

With the professional volleyball tour now located there and Jordin Sparks shows there every other day - it's really turning into a hub for the Westside. 

I went over there to meet a friend (from Surprise) to hangout as this was decided to be a good meeting point.  Westgate sports that whole faux-town square thing that is all the rage in American suburbia.  You'll find a grassy town square (with baby trees offering little to no shade) that kids and families actually hang out in.  You'll find actual middle class shops in contrast to Kierland Commons.   This place isn't exactly my cup of tea, but people at the center seemed to be enjoying it as it was quite busy.

It's a loud bold monstrosity in what seems (at least now) to be the middle of nowhere - like an oasis in the middle of one GIANT parking lot.   The huge AMC movieplex and Renaissance Marriott hotel are the centerpieces here and chain restaurants abound here like Yard House, Gordon Biersch and soon to be built Gardunos.  

It's like a smaller version of Kierland with retail on the first floor and office on the upper floors, but more isolated, with not as many stores and with huge Times Square-like billboard ads EVERYWHERE.

We had the shrimp dumplings, lotus leaf rice, barbeque pork buns, pork and shrimp dumplings, tofu skin roll, chicken feet, tripe, beef balls, rice noodle rolls, and savory stuffed dumplings.  The food was decent flavor-wise but the downside was that everything was only lukewarm except for the savory stuffed dumplings.  We got the savory stuffed dumplings towards the end of our meal.

This place is a dream!
From the moment you open the beautiful, giant, wooden door, it's like you walk in to a magical secret garden!
There's an amazing greenhouse on the inside which is what first grabs you, but to look around and see all of the art and antiquities that fill the space; you can't help but be mesmerized! I didn't want to miss out on anything!!!! Lol
A vast array of different tea cups and tea pots all with delicate flowery designs.
Every seating area has its own design and character. There's even a bench swing!!! 
We had a large group and we wanted to try everything.... So we did! Lol
I can't even remember all the names, but let the pics tell the story!!
Staff were all very friendly, curtious and attentive. 
As beautiful as all the desserts were, however, the flavors were kind of just OK.
I hate to even say that but for us it was true. 
We did order the vegetarian Brioche and THAT did not dissapoint!, I would go back just for that! I love alfalfa sprouts. I forgot to take a picture of that tho! Lol
Friends also ordered the Salmon Brioche which I did taste and was amazing as well. 
Another friend ordered the ham and cheese croissant and that looked really good. I wouldve asked them to add alfalfa sprouts on it! 
For drinks I ordered the blended matcha w/almond milk and my friend ordered the blended vanilla Chai w/soy milk. Those were really good also. 
The matcha has a full, matcha flavor and the vanilla Chai was so delicious! 
We will definitely return to try other items and to take another taste of what we loved the most!
Enjoy!
5 stars just cause the scenery and the staff are great!!
Side note:
I was thinking about it later and realized maybe our sweet drinks were overpowering the desserts. So you should definitely take into consideration, that it may be wise to get an espresso or something that's not so sweet, as to compliment the dessert.

You know the ones, bleached out by the sun, faux-gold-trimmed red letters blaring at you. The instinctive feeling that there is no way you're going to make it from your car to the door without being asked to loan a few dollars to a guy down on his luck but somehow inexplicably blessed with a handgun down his waistband.

Then you walk in. And it's like you're in a dainty Asian bistro in Scottsdale. Except there's one big screen TV and it's tuned to CMT. Ha ha, you smugly think to yourself - there's no way a TV would be tuned to CMT in Scottsdale! But then you are just taken with how lovely the place is. But WTF? Do you seat yourself? Two Asian women dressed as servers are fliitting about, but don't seem to see you (as it turns out, this is an unfortunate recurring theme here). 

Eventually, one does see you. ""Two?"" she pantomimes, holding up two fingers but not actually speaking. ""Two,"" you say, acknowledging. They then seat you at the only table in the entire restaurant that is made for two. Neatly tucked right behind the kitchen's microwave, which you will hear beeping incessantly during your meal. I am being jocular, of course, but seriously, we looked around and we were both like ""wow, this is the only two-seater in the whole place. They must not get many parties of two!"" While I am trying to be funny, I'm not at all kidding about the microwave beeping.

During the remainder of the meal, the wait staff can only be described as ""oddly distracted and negligent, considering there were maybe ten people in the whole restaurant."" There was no rudeness, and once our orders were in, food came VERY quickly. The thing is, it took fifteen minutes (and a pretty decent glare on my part) before a waitress came to ask us what we wanted to drink. Well thank you, since I've been sitting here for fifteen freaking minutes, I know not only what I want to drink, but what I want to eat. So we ordered.

When the food came, and it came fast, it was a blizzard of BRILLIANCE. I had the hot and spicy fish (hot), my wife had the pad thai (medium).  Both dishes were unbelievably delicious. I had mine ""hot"" and it was agreeably hot, I will try the ""thai hot"" next time just to see how much they can make me sweat. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. The appetizer of ""thai eggrolls"" was delicious, if meager.

During the meal we were asked if we wanted refills this many times: 0. We were asked how our meal was this many times: 0. We were approached by our waitress for any reason whatsoever this many times: 0. Once we were done with our meal, we flagged our waitress down (clearly, she was having a rough night, what with the 6 or 8 people left in the restaurant) and managed to get a check. 

As bad as the service was, the food is so stupid good that I'm giving four stars anyway. Do yourself a favor: if you like Thai food, give Siam Thai a shot.",2010-03-13 05:26:46

Facility: Mostly clean when you walk in. They use a fresh towel for each client which I like, but do not use new files & sponges nor do they sanitize the drills before each client. I also do not believe they wipe down the tables with any alcohol after each client, but the table looks clean when you sit down. It seems rare these days that nail salons would practice good hygiene because money is tight. 

I got a gel polish removal and a basic manicure. It started out with Jenny that filed the gel down, but got up halfway to tend to another client that walked in, then Nancy came along and finished the service up. I'm not bothered by it much, but wish there was some communication because I was a little confused as to what was going on. Total cost was $31 paid with cash. 

Nancy did very well in getting all the polish off, shortening the nail and filed them down really nicely. My cuticles were well attended to and trimmed just a little of the dead skin. She made a lot of detail and went back when something was amiss. The hand massage was quite nice as well and my hands and nails came out looking very moisturized and great. 

One star was taking off because they can really improve on communication skills between the client and nail tech. Everyone is super quiet and not trying to make any conversation at all with the client. It seemed quiet awkward very awkward and eerie in the salon. The client next to me was trying to make conversation, but the nail tech only replied with one word answers. Also, when I got up to leave after finishing the drying station, no one bothered to say goodbye to me and only one of them put cuticle oil on my fingers. It felt like I was appreciated as much?

They forgot to put down my order of onion rings, or it went to someone else (don't know what happened there) and then they mixed up my drink cup size, with no drink cup...needless to say I had to wait another few minutes for them to cook an order of onion rings.  Not a real big deal, other than my chili cheese dog was getting cold.  Once the order was ready though, I took it and my tray of food to a table.  The onion rings really didn't taste like they were fully cooked based on the batter consistency and it was all ""clumped"" together, which was a disappointment.  I was really looking forward to them, they were the shoe string type of onion rings.  The chili cheese dog was ok, I do like char-grilled hot dogs, but nothing that really stood out to me to say wow.  But the buns they use are quality ones (I believe they are the potato buns).  I wouldn't mind though going back, when I'm in the area and trying a regular jumbo dog with my choice of traditional fixings...and will go with the French fries next time.",2017-08-07 23:47:43

Well there was one breast so my hubby got screwed but he is willing to eat dark meat too. We got the chicken original style, so we could gauge how good the chicken is without heat.

FJcT1mTMl5dqg56vKA2A3Q,3QFq-MJR6VcgpcgXNkc4gg,yHBhLawYmIthUPLbUXK5kw,4,3,0,0,"Some notes: restaurant is located in the Esplandade with the AMC cinema and to the east of the Ritz Carleton.  Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  

That being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.

Greeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as ""XL"".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  

Nice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!

TROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.

Drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!

Entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.

I'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!

Was my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.

Huge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!

Bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!

So at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had ""hid"" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25)
For sure, we will be back.  It's a field trip for us, but worth it.  Just an all-around good experience.",2013-10-03 14:52:27

It's a very nice and out of the ordinary restaurant and bar. Very open and airy. No wonder why the brunch is such a good idea. They have a private area upstairs that is great for receptions and the such.

The food was just okay. Beautiful presentation on the salads and sandwiches, but it's nothing to rave about. If you want to dine at a standard locally owned American eatery without going to Chilis give this place a try. My Cobb salad arrived promptly, but it barely had any dressing and though I could have asked for more it should probably come on the side if they intend on adding it so sparingly. I thought the water from the freshly washed lettuce was the dressing. A dry salad is not an enjoyable salad.

The server wasn't really proactive or perhaps the water was shut off in the restaurant. Four people and myself didn't have a refill the entire time! I'm surprised the server didn't notice. Nor did they offer a to-go container for left over soup which comes in an enormous portion that should probably be scaled back.

My girlfriend has dropped our dog off 5x already & this is the only pet hotel she never has anxiety about leaving her dog. He's like an extension of our family as I'm sure yours is. It's worth the little bit of extra money to leave your pet here. Even our dog loves this place. He seems to be comfortable only when we bring him here. Any other place we've ever left him he's always nervous and looks scared when we leave him. But not here.,2017-11-06 17:14:20

And if you wanna see a stage production about how the nation is being lied to and manipulated, try Edgyplay Noodles. If you want a place to pull your Greyhound Bus into at the terminal, try Emptybay Noodles. And if you are feeling horny, try Entryway Noodles. But this is none of these.

What to get: Mango Milk Tea w/ Pudding and Lychee Jelly.
What not to get: A drink much better than your friend's because it might make them jelly.
What else: Where did that cute Mango?

How to improve: Offer small sizes in bubble teas, and make them a slightly better product.

Erryday Noodles is not the kind of place I'd come erryday, especially not for Bubble Tea because, well, I don't want my stomach to be the size of Pittsburgh. I have yet to try their food but one of these days, I shall.

At first I was going to give them 5 stars for bubble tea, but over the year or two since I first tried it, I've had a thousand bubble teas and my taste has become somewhat more refined. All I can say now is that it's good, but not amazing. I'd put several (including Love Yogurt, I-Tea and Sumi's) significantly ahead of it in the Burgh Bubble Battles.

Speaking of Bubbles, the tapioca itself in here is a bit rubber and tasteless even though the drinks are pretty good. Milk tea is average but some of the other products taste better, such as Mango Milk with Pudding and Lychee Jelly. I do like the prices, which are larger than anywhere in the area, and for less money. I also love the service at EN, which is always friendly, prompt, and courteous. 

And if you just came here for a cup of tea, don't bother. You should have gone to Earlgrey Noodles.",2017-03-15 21:46:36

We were looking for a new pizza place to try near our house on a lazy Sunday.  Given that some seem closed on Sundays, we decided to look up Fazio's as I had in my bookmarks.  Although it said it was closed here on Yelp (I did send a message with the hours for it to be corrected), we continued to look at the menu that it had a link to.  It said they were open so we called in our order. 

Large cheese pizza and 1/2 chicken parm hoagie to go (we did not want to commit to a whole after a few bad experiences elsewhere).  We wish that we ended up getting a whole though, that is for sure.  The pizza was thinner, not too heavy crust wise, there was ample cheese (by ample, I mean a lot), and the sauce was great IMO.  The chicken parm hoagie was crispy, not mushy, and absolutely awesome!  Everything was awesome... and we will definitely be ordering from there again.  My husband said that they were extremely nice in there too.

Literally, I was a ""kid in a candy store"" and was amazed by their setup here.  Almost cafeteria-esq style, you walk in, get greeted by the hostess/greeter person and he/she will give you a plastic card.  Depending on what you would like to eat for that meal, you walk up to the counter and order.  Place your card on the ""magic"" slot device and the put the item you are about to receive on it and you pay the cashier on the way out.  Kinda genius if you think about it.  Less waiters (they still bus the tables for you) and the tables are first come-first serve.

I think my favorite part of this place is that they make their pasta in-house.  Even have a room dedicated to it.  During my lunch, I totally watched a guy make pasta from scratch and then put it through a machine.  Rotini was being made at that particular time.

I ordered from the pasta station and the chef?/line cook was super nice.  I think he could tell I was a newbie, and was patient with me.  Deciding on the Smoked Salmon Carbonera... the started making my lunch right in front of me.  In about 7-8 min... I had a delicious, steaming bowl of pasta presented before me.  My buddy had a salad which involved a beeper (so will have to try that next time).  And their pizza's look pretty awesome too.

I ended up having my exterior painted several weeks earlier than originally scheduled due to some changes, which was fine by me.
 
The crew, which is an actual crew of employees rather than short-term fillers, was timely, professional, and did a great job on my house. Most importantly, their communication was quick. I had some questions/concerns about paint colors. I received e-mail responses long past regular business hours and the supervisor was out there the very next day to address all of my questions.

I had a brief panic several months after my painting project was finished when I noticed these tiny little chipping areas on one side of my house. Once again, I e-mailed them and received a response outside of normal hours. I had someone out there within 48 hours to resolve the issue, which they believe was the result of a hail storm.

As Friday's approach I start thinking about this place pretty much every weekend. If I'm in town and not exploring other parks this is super convenient and really the perfect, quick getaway. Just over half an hour from the strip for tourists and just 15 mins from my home in Summerlin. If I could start everyday in this park I would. I'm absolutely smitten by it and I continue to discover more of its beauty on each visit. 

The 13 mile scenic drive is great but I highly encourage everyone to get out of their car and get on a trail. The deeper in you get the more beautiful and serene it gets. It's so worth it to sweat a little and explore what this area has to offer. You can get on a very easy trail or you can pretend you're a mountain climber and risk your life the way I do. Whatever floats your boat. 

My favorite area so far is the Lost Creek Trail that is less visited & not too many visitors go all the way so I love the peace & quiet you can get out there. I've started bringing a blanket with me & I'll lay out in the middle of nowhere just off the trail & I hope to have many more of these blissful moments.

The trees, flowers, birds & sun never get old. This place is lovely all year round and you can plan your hikes accordingly based on the time of year. Pick the shady ones during peak summer months like Ice Box Canyon & the wide open ones with tons of sun during the colder months like Lost Creek Trail.

The lounge is well equipped with everything from showers, to the most recent issue of the Economist (which you can take with you)! The food options range from appetizers to hot food and to my surprise, the self serve open bar features more than a few top shelf items. Perhaps most importantly for frequent fliers, the lounge seating is definitely more comfortable than the average flight lounge, though I did not notice any beds/ recliners! Finally, I did not sense an air (!) of pretension and instead found the staff to be very courteous and accommodating.

The prices are on par with other AYCE sushi places.  $21.95 for lunch and $25.95 for dinner.  You can add $6 for AYCE dungeness crab.  I didn't see a stamp card offer.

Items come out on the conveyor belt, so if you are a piggy family like mine, you'll want a seat to the right of the restaurant to get first pick of the items.  ""Entrees"" as well as sushi are all on the conveyor belt.  Rolls come out with 4 peices, nigiri with 2.  ""Entrees"" are really just the hot items that come from the kitchen.  The serving sizes are rather small, what most other AYCE places call appetizers.  But they are tasty.  We tried:
Shrimp fried rice - tasty but not something I'd normally get at at AYCE place.  But dad prefers the cooked stuff
Pot stickers - very good, not a meat fillind
Lettuce wrap - this was primarily mushrooms but really tasty.  Just wish there weren't so much of the fried shrimp cracker type stuff inside
Dungeness crab in black bean sauce - this was my favorite of the two crab preparations but some was over cooked so it was hard to get the meat out
Dungeness crab salt and pepper - this had jalapenos and was a bit salty
Prawns - really good though a little over cooked
Kalbi - nice flavor but a little tough
garlic beef - very tough

They have a few items that are one order only 
Blue fin tuna - out of stock
fatty tuna - perfect!
ama ebi - really good but no heads.  :(
tobiko - they had wasabi tobiko which had quite the kick and the red tobiko which I prefered
oysters - very plump and well cleaned

I don't think there was anything we tried that we didn't like.  Servers were friendly and efficient, especially with such a crazy crowd.

Only downsides I can think of are bathrooms are singles, not a lot of parking, and not a lot of tables/seats so big parties will have problems here.",2018-05-08 17:03:08

(You saw that coming and still kept reading so whose fault is that, really.)

Toasted bread and yeast butter comes with your order. The roasted squid was great but considering that's what it's called, perhaps they should pull back on the pork belly so it's not 50-50. Needs more squid. The crispy squash with brown butter hollandaise is very good, you can't skip it. And another must for meat lovers is the rib eye steak. Cooked slowly to perfection so order it early if you're starving. The king oyster mushrooms that come with it are almost as good as the steak itself.

Marked solely by a giant nose on the outside is a tapas restaurant with fantastic atmosphere, good food for a reasonable price and even better service. 

My friend & I ordered the scallops with the pork belly, beef carpaccio, risotto balls and the prosciutto wrapped figs. We also got sides of sweet potato mash & rapini.
I had such high hopes for the scallops which is why, perhaps, I was slightly disappointed: the serving comes with 2 scallops and a piece of pork belly. My scallop was on the chewy side but, even more disappointing was that the pork belly was lean and oversalted. I have a feeling that I would have enjoyed this dish more had I not expected the world of it.The risotto balls were bland, though well cooked and had a nice texture.
The beef carpaccio was fantastic! But by far my favourite dish has to be the prosciutto-wrapped figs: just the right amount of sweet and salty; delicious! The sweet potato mash was a nice surprise, served with brown butter and sage, while I found the rapini to be a little on the bitter side and could have done perhaps with a little more flavour. 
We had the cheese plate for dessert and were disappointed that there were only 2 types of cheese.

What really sets this restaurant apart, however, is the amazing service we received. Our water glasses were never empty, our server checked up on us several times, was extremely friendly and helpful... even the busboy was a treat! He was friendly, upbeat & cleared our tables quickly and efficiently. 

There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so will definitely be back again. Great place for dates :)",2012-04-29 00:16:57

It's on the 2nd floor, and it has one of the smallest and most unattractive signs I've seen in downtown Toronto. Anyways, the reviews here made me come here. Being a massive cheapo, I'm always on the hunt for good food at decent prices.

We had Macau chicken (so called Portuguese chicken but it's not actually from Portugal) and the ground beef casserole. My partner didn't like the ground beef casserole because the sauce was too sweet. It doesn't taste like meat sauce. I tried a little and I agree. It's edible, but not something I'd order again. The Macau chicken is one of my favourites. Here, it's just OK. This dish had several problems. First of all, the rice was separate from the sauce. This is a dish that tastes much better when it's a casserole. Secondly, the chicken pieces were full of bones. I went to Cafe Arc De Triomphe and their chicken was way better. 

We both had the corn chicken soup which came with the meal. It's again, edible. It's not something I'd crave. I'm getting a different soup next time.

Like most Chinese places, don't expect much service. But like most Chinese places, their menu is very extensive. 

From a purely food quality perspective, the food should be 2 stars. But I'm bumping it up to 3 because it makes me feel like I'm in HK and the prices are ridiculously cheap. They have daily specials at $6.75 and the food portion is large. Comes with soup too. I'd actually come here again just because of how cheap the food is.

This restaurant is location in the middle of Crystals on the Strip.  From the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured ""treehouse"". It sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out I feel a little disappointed, because I felt like I was eating in an ""upscale"" food court with views of retail stores, such as  LV, Jimmy Choo, and Zegna.  Not exactly, the scene I expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.

However, service was impeccable, except we were only told the beef carpaccio was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  In a rush we picked tuna tartare as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the chopped salad,  king crab legs and sea bass.  

We ordered a bottle of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc for $70. Given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. The wine list is comprehensive.

I am kind of bored with tuna tartare, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  It is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  

The mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  I just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; I like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   Definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. 

Chopped salad was solid and I like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.

The King Crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. I was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  

I love Chilean Sea Bass prepared any way, but I it was pan-fried to perfection.  The outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  The serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.

No room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  Very generous.

Overall, pretty good, but again I couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. We left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.

Don't know why it is called ""beach club"".  The environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a ""beach club"".  That may be a good thing, though.

Will I go again? Probably not, I think Joe's Seafood (NOT the Crab Shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.",2013-03-18 18:56:51

A favorite spot for almost three years, I walked in this morning with thoughts of fresh croissants, melted cheese, tomato pesto, and omelets, but when I saw a new menu the words aÃ§aÃ­ bowl, I went in that direction. Olivier's super cool mom described the preparation: organic aÃ§aÃ­ blended with almond milk, banana, and a touch of agave, served with granola and sweet pineapple- ananas, as she told me in French. :) Later, Olivier asked how I enjoyed the bowl and mentioned that it was inspired by his Hawaiian vacation-- not Rio, but that's OK. (mental image of Olivier at CarnavÃ¡l carrying pineapples on his head goes here)

It was different from a traditional aÃ§aÃ­ bowl, but very flavorful and enjoyable. The Amazonian aÃ§aÃ­ was not thick nor overwhelmed by banana. If you prefer a smoothie texture, ask if they can accommodate. The pineapple was perfectly ripe. They carry a selection of organic bottled beverages, and the grapefruit ginger juice paired nicely with the bowl. If I type the word aÃ§aÃ­ one more time, this review will be filtered as Portuguese.

The best soups in Las Vegas are found at Baguette Cafe. I'm looking forward to summer if only for the chilled gazpacho with crunchy granitÃ© and whipped creme fraiche. I usually order a half sandwich and soup combo and am satisfied with the portions. The quiche, breakfast pastries, tarts, and desserts are all excellent.

I wish Yelp would implement a filter to ignore any Elitist review that deducts a star because the reviewer thinks Baguette Cafe is hard to find or complains that this family business closes on Saturday and Sunday. Yelp responsibly, or don't be taken seriously. Bonjour!",2014-01-17 02:29:40

It's a really cute old school dinner with a new twist. The name, as it implies, indicates that you can add foie gras to any dish for $9.95! Because I went for breakfast, I didn't try this. 

It's a relatively small place so going a little earlier would probably be best to avoid lines. My sister and I went at around 11:30 AM and got a spot right away, but the place was already pretty filled and it was a freezing cold day. 

I ordered the ham eggs benedict - a classic and always good. Next time I'd probably want to try the truffle spaghetti, it sounded amazing! My sister opted for something more original and got the roasted vegetables and goat cheese tart. It was very beautifully plated and quite delicious.

The tuna is fresh and tasty and the taste doesn't need to be masked with gloopy gloop and fried rice krispie bits.  There are too many fried rolls on the menu!

TRUST in your FISH, 18!  It stands on it's own!

The spicy tuna is GREAT and the wine list is VERY good.  Trefethen chardonnay...and I think there was a bottle of Gary Farrell at one point.  WELL done on your wine choices.  (I think 1/2 prices on Tues? - not sure - check with 18.)

A lady working at the till gave us another, which we then proceeded to order from. She kept cutting us off, and just being pretty rude in general when we inquired about a certain dish.  I was getting frustrated at their attitudes and was pretty 'hangry' at that point, and I guess I looked annoyed because that was when she started being nice, apologizing that she couldn't understand us.

Upon entering this great little store I was greeted by one of the owners.  She welcomed me in and walked over to see if I needed some assistance.  Since I was just wandering by after having a late breakfast across the way I thanked her and said I'd see her at the register.  

This is the type of store that once you walk in you can't walk out without finding something awesome to take home.  I would love for the owner to come to my house and decorate exactly as she has in this store.  It's a unique mix of home furnishings & wall hangings to Alex and Ani bracelets to specialty baby items like beautiful baby bags and clothing.  There are some really beautiful angel wings hanging on the wall.  So freaking awesome!  Today I found my bestie the cutest most comfortable pair of slippers.  When I say cute I am talking soft and cushiony with the most gorgeous fat ribbon bow on top with beautiful crystals adorning the bow. So unique and special.  I also picked up a few of their food items.  My mom loves scones so I got a box of scone mix and some specialty jam.  

This store is special because they offer things you can't find just anywhere.  They sell the little touches of comfort you place around your home to make it more personal.  Prices are very reasonable and the service here is great.  They make you feel like family!

Parking is a breeze as you can park in front of the store or behind.  It's such a pleasant center and the ambiance both inside and outside the store is so great.

Ordered the eggs Benedict, which were excellent. After watching many episodes of Masterchef US and trying it myself, I am very picky on them (poached eggs need to ooze out the yolk without being under-cooked, English muffin has to be crispy, bacon needs to have the right texture and hollandaise sauce needs to be tasty). Seasons hit all of those notes, so it was perfect.  I also got a coffee and it tasted good too (not sure if it was the relaxed atmosphere - but it was much better than Timmy's).  

The only downside is I'm such a cheapskate, so $15 for breakfast is a bit much to me, but it was eggs Benedict (that really could be for two people - at least for breakfast) and a coffee.  It's not expensive at all, but I'm just cheap.

The decor is lackluster and boring. It's feels like they tried to make it high end but completely missed the mark. Cheap Chinese take out menus really throw off the experience from the get go as well. Not a place to bring a date lol

Sitting at the bar made things rather difficult to get a servers attention, which made ordering a hassle. The menu had like 6 food items from the kitchen and the rest was alcohol. You should study up on kinds of sushi before going in or you'll spend your 45mins trying to figure out what they have. ( yep there was a 45min limit...)

The quality of fish is pretty bad, even for ayce standards. The portions were too small and by the time the item I wanted got around to me, they were all gone. ( sit on the right side of the restaurant if you don't want to leave hungry)

If you want good AYCE sushi go to Yama or Kaya. If you want good conveyor belt sushi go to Sapporo. 

I'll try them again later this week or the following to see if they got any better. Until then, 2 stars at best

Bukowski. Nirvana vinyl! There's industrial metal shelving and spotlights and branding on every damn thing in the whole place. Everything here is for sale.

We visited Bob just a day after their grand opening. I waited a long time to order, not because of a long line, just super slow service. I waited even longer for my beverage, and while I waited I watched as the counter person forgot to give customer after customer their baked goods. The London Fog I ordered was very tasty, but I have no idea why it took so long to make. We also had a drip coffee, it was so acidic we only drank a third of the cup before throwing it out. 

There was a female barista, and a female counter person. As they worked, an unsmiling, unengaged man stood behind them and watched. He made no attempt to speak to any of the customers. I can only assume that he was the owner, supervising - but shouldn't the owner, on day two of business, make an effort to smile and say hi?

The unsmiling management only heightened the overbearing masculine energy of this place. It's all very smug, as if they are planning on franchising into the next Starbucks. I think it's supposed to be gritty, but it just seems contrived? Boring. Functionally, those metal shelves are at just the right height to put your kid's eye out. Despite this being a family heavy neighborhood (indeed, Bob is right across the street from Action Potential Lab!), there is no change table, not even a hook for your bag or coat in the basement washrooms.

I went here for a staff lunch and left full of amazing food. We split some great French pressed coffee while pondering the menu, until we were informed that was from last night's dinner - if there was something that we wanted on the menu, we could ask and they'd check with the kitchen. We asked if they could whip up some delicious truffle fries for us, they checked, and they did.

Pittsburgh is getting really good about gourmet, seasoned fries and these were no exception. They arrived along-side delicious tempura-battered vegetables (om nom nom sweet potatoes), and a pear and Gorgonzola flatbread (also om nom nom).

Being the sucker that I am for beet salads, ever since I went to Salt of the Earth I've been devouring them, I got the pistachio chicken, beet, and goat cheese salad.

I loved the terrace!! It's under the roof of the building, so no direct sun, but the walls are all wide open and each opening is framed in curtains. The floor is smooth brick. The tables are heavy and the chairs super comfortable, but firm enough to eat on comfortably. The center 6 chairs where we sat are wicker with thick bottom coushins and two thick back cushions plus an accent pillow. 

The decor inside and out is calming and decorated in the theme of an English hunting pub. There are horse and dog paintings on the walls and lots of wood and warm colors and stone used in the design of the space. 

Before leaving our table the manager handed me a greeting card that said congratulations which was a super nice touch! (The person who made the reservation for me and took me to dinner here told the host when making the reservation that we were celebrating something). The card was signed inside by all the staff and a handwritten message read: ""Congratulations from the ML Tavern Staff!"" The manager also handed out his business card and invited comments and feedback and made himself available if we needed anything.

The service could not be more impeccable, and when I say impeccable, I'm talking proper ladies dressed oh-so-properly in aprons, who refer to themselves as Mrs. So and So.  It all made me feel a bit like a naughty schoolgirl.  But I digress....
What brought us there, of course, was the meat.  I've dined at Lawry's in LA, and well, a huge, rare cut of prime rib just sounded good, so away we went, to carnivore heaven.  Perfect as always, from the extra-dry martini, to the spinning salad with amazing house dressing, to the always-perfect prime rib, carved table-side.  I, for a fairly small girl, can pretty much consume my weight in rare beef, so I was pretty damn content.  Yorkshire pudding, done just right added the perfect touch.  
All in all, a great meal, served perfectly, which is what one would expect from Lawry's The Prime Rib.
A lovely plus?  Not a child in sight!  I'm sure it happens, but thankfully, not while we were there!
Dessert?  Well, that was later, at another location, but I'm quite sure they do dessert as well as they do everything else.

As a No Frills goes, stock wise it's actually superior to most -- lots of things here you wouldn't normally find at a discount grocer.  Prices are good, nice variety... but:

1)  shopping carts are dingy, old, and broken down.
2)  shopping carts (again) are located either in the below ground parking lot, or in the NASTY corral outside that has on occasion smelled of urine, vomit, and dead animal.
3)  terrible layout... where the hell is everything?  is there any rhyme or reason to how things are stocked?
4)  questionable staff -- I actually witnessed a staff member stocking halal meat next to and on top of bulk packaged pork... a manager was there, told him he couldn't do that, and they subsequently got into a heated argument (complete with 'F' shots)

All that aside, I can't ignore the variety available here... so every few weeks I'll come back, pick up a few things, and be done with it.

We've done both. The signature Blu Burger came exactly as described, and cooked to perfection (medium). The onion bun was fresh and the side of onion rings were great. To build your own, select your burger (beef, turkey, bison, chicken, veggie, salmon, Portobello....), select the bun (you can even get a lettuce wrap), cheese, toppings, sauces and any specialty ingredients (egg, guacamole, ham....). I highly recommend the Kobe beef; it was so flavorful and that will probably be a go-to selection in the future. Must say I'm not overly impressed with the sweet potato fries, though. Hard to find good sweet potato fries it seems.

The location is kind of odd as you don't really see it from Stephanie. The whole strip mall is not even facing the main road, it's awkwardly sideways. Just pull into the driveway past Marie Calendars and it will be on your left side.

So yes, the food here is awesome especially the Agadashi tofu. I've had this dish numerous times and I really do appreciate the presentation at Momo. The tofu is cut up in nice bite size pieces and sitting inside a bowl of broth. At other places the tofu is cut larger. When it's served larger so many awkward things can happen. 1) you cut it with your chopsticks and the crispy glaze breaks off. 2) you bite into it and you look like a Neanderthal with food dropping out of your mouth. 3) other embarrassing moments that should be left alone. The pieces at Momo were perfect!!

The rolls were so good. If you like tuna try the ultimate tuna roll. Spicy tuna with tuna on top, sitting in a spicy garlic type sauce/ oil. So good and the sauce keeps it moist!

Switching to another gym was pretty much out of the question, as I had a very regimented routine I pretty much 'enjoyed' at Goodlife, and I'm very independent, so the lack of experienced trainers, etc is something I cared less about.

Ya don't mess with a girls' schedule & routine!

But I was curious, and when I saw the 30 day pass pop up on GroupOn pop up, it was my opportunity to check this place out .... 
 
While the monthly membership is significantly more than what you'd pay at a chain-facility, you're getting completely different caliber of (clearly) highly educated staff, classes that you'll actually continue to attend week after week, just so you can see yourself improve. 
 
It's only a bonus the trainers actually work out themselves! (unlike the 'fluffy' looking staff at most GL's) 
 
I'm not exactly the typical gym-goer; I'm not there just to go through the motions. I'm not a cardio bunny.  I want a challenge, I want someone to show me something new.  In fact, I didn't realized how stagnant my own workouts had gotten -- I'd been doing my own training, or I'd hire an online coach that specializes in what I was doing at that point in time.  I'd always been providing for myself .. 

UNTIL i attended a 'group' class at Totum.
I usually don't even bother with classes, as I never found them challenging or enjoyed them  ....  
It was amazing. I had felt muscles I'd been working for years, but the variety kicked my ass. And I was hooked from week 1. 

I'm down 2.5"" on my waist, and it's been 3 weeks of steady Bells & Balls classes, and a crap load of other classes that are guaranteed to get you into the best shape of your life if you're willing to put your heart and soul into it. 

I also love that the other members of this facility really do love working out, and pushing themselves ... which is a drastic change from a mediocre facility with a million machines, and personal trainers who are barely 'certified' under CanFit Pro. 

The staff at Totum are a different caliber: They're Kinesoloigists', they're Physiotherapists ...They've completed Iron Mans', triathlon's, they can talk to you about Paleo and Ketogenic dieting ...  and they practice what they preach.. they're legit. They're the real deal.

I am in love with this place.

If you're 15-35, you can get $14 tickets on the day of. You can also subscribe (min 3 concerts) for $33 each for seats that usually sell for $110 (in the case of Joshua Bell next month). I thought it was an excellent deal, until I realized how empty the place was and should have tried to get the $14 tickets. 

They have also started to have Casual Concerts, where no need to dress up (unfortunate how this means to come people stilettos and short skirt). and the Concert Master will chit chat with you about the piece.

Sometimes at the end of the performance, there's a free concert and refreshments in the lobby.

Slightly odd was the lychee martini had no lychee in it (like you know the spinney red fruit with the white eatable part inside).  I really just like vodka with a floating lychee, my explanation to the bartender/drink maker upper/server fellow didn't seem to efficiently communicate this.  A next drink of a drought Hoegarden was perfect though... so nice on the deck!",2008-05-01 20:10:07

The food offers a wide variety to choose from and I like that many of the apps and entrees are created for a sharing environment. I've worked my way thru the menu pretty quickly.  Here's some suggestions:

*Starters*
Tater Tots
Deviled Eggs
Warm Mixed Nuts
Citrus Olives

Roasted Beets
Heirloom Tomato Salad (Tasty, but 3 slices was not worth the price)

*Main Dishes*
Mac N Chees
Short Ribs 
   (The gravy boat dish is cool, but the rib needs to be cut into smaller pieces)

*Dessert*
Cheese Cake with Tortilla Ice Cream
   I'm not the biggest fan of dairy, but Tortilla Ice Cream is great!

All in all, I'm happy with the cocktails and apps at any hour.  You do pay for the upscale environment to be downtown, but I feel it's worth the experience.  The elevated view out of the windows is a spectacular over the city.

The biggest perk is you can head upstairs to Lustre's rooftop bar for a night cap.  You'll see a lot of the same staff working both bars.

I recommend for anyone especially the Scottsdale crowd before catching a game",2012-06-26 05:15:28

After an invasive medical procedure at another hospital -- see immediately preceding review -- I developed a high fever with severe chills.  I am diabetic which means a fever over a certain level is a cause for immediate concern and mine was above that point.

While the emergency room was very fast (probably because I went there around 3 AM and they weren't busy) they were completely useless.  After taking my history which mentioned the diabetes and recent invasive procedure, the young doctor who examined me said it was probably the flu and sent me home. 

I took a copy of the bloodwork as I wanted to take it to my personal care doctor the next day.  I looked at the various white cell counts and noticed the neutrophils were high and the remainder of white cell types were normal.  After consulting Wikipedia, I learned this is a definite indicator of bacterial infection - the various other white blood cell types react to viruses or parasites, but neutrophils (the ones that create pus) are specifically there to fight bacteria.  So obviously, this was not the flu, which is viral.  My personal care doctor wisely gave me antibiotics - including an injection - the next morning.   I strongly believe this was a case of sepsis so if I had not questioned his diagnosis and gone to see her I might have become very sick or possibly died.

The doctor who saw me was foreign, but one wold think that proper reading knowledge  of blood work - especially something apparently  as basic as knowing the difference between types of white cells - would necessary to become a doctor.  Perhaps he slept through med school that day.  I welcome comments from the instution or those in the medical profession.

This was especially obnoxious as the ER was totally not busy and they had plenty of time to examine things carefully.  The extra start is due to the better care my housemate had with his surgery; otherwise I would not have given it.",2015-06-08 19:40:05

Side of salsa - pretty uninspiring.

I loved staying here! I was originally slated to stay in a different place on the other side of town, but paying about $120 & basically living in a cardboard box was not my cup of tea, so my coworker suggested the Residence Inn, where he stayed last year & was currently staying.

Check in was seamless and the lobby was beautifully decorated, my bags were taken to my room, I was given a brief tour where I was shown the business center, gym, pool, breakfast area, and basketball/tennis courts.

My room was on the 8th floor, and upon entering I was pleasantly surprised, a full kitchen greeted me to the right, including a table for two, a complete living room and office area greeted me to the left (the couch even had a pull out bed), and the bedroom/bathroom/closet was just around the corner.

With sweeping views of the strip, Las Vegas Eye, and the mountains, I was very pleased.

There was a complimentary breakfast each day from 6am-930am (I was only able to partake a couple of weekends due to my work schedule), and every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday the hotel had mixers where they would play music, serve delicious food (taco night was amazing), and unlimited drinks. You got to meet other folks who lived in the hotel and it was super fun!

My one complaint was the washing machines. They had a weird smell and I found myself washing my clothes at least twice to insure they were really clean. Also, a hotel with 11 floors and probably 20 rooms on each floor should have more than six washers/dryers. I was sometimes doing laundry until 2-3am because of how busy it was.

A group of 50 people or more would always be waiting in the elevator section waiting for one to finally come down. The average waiting time would be about 15-20 minutes. One night, we decided not to go out because we didn't want to have to brave the elevators. Once we finally found stairs, they were in one of the most sketchy stairways I had ever seen and it led us out a side exit of the hotel.

The room was perfect. I have no complaints about the room and cleaning ladies.

Check-in was horrid. All weekend, the lines were LONG. We got lucky and checked out on a Monday morning at 7am with no line. But any other time, you spent 30-60 minutes in line.

If I can offer one tip on the Eaton Centre, it is to avoid weekends.

The store is multiple levels and there are an endless amount of categories to explore from ""true crime"" to ""whaling"" to ""cooking"" and ""cats""! I'm positive you can even find a section on ""pirates"".

The entrance is a big hidden through the alleyway beside Weslodge. Upon entry, the place was filled with the nice-dressed financial district crowd. It was dimlight, the decor was beautiful and it was loud enough to be lively but not so much that you had to yell across the table. 

We ordered the large seafood paella ($55), chorizo, manchego flatbread and brussel sprouts for 3 people. 

The paella wasn't as big as we thought it would be for $55. I wouldn't say it was anything special. I expected the seafood to be a lot better for that price. The chorizo was the cheapest charcuterie item, but for $8, we expected more than a couple slices of cut up sausage on a plate. We definitely were disappointed by that. The flatbread was a crowd pleaser - probably my favourite dish. The brussel sprouts came with chorizo, which was nice, but I thought they could've been crispier 

As nice as the drinks were, the cocktails ranged from $12-18, which to be honest, I think is pretty overpriced (just like the food).

We got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. I was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. I was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sautÃ©ed onions, but wow were they good. Seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. Tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste. I wish I had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with It (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came.)

The pizza was also quite good. I loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza.

Since we're obviously in the 'burbs you must first manoeuvre your SUV or minivan into a parking lot that can only be measured in football fields. After acquiring a spot nowhere near the store, get out of your car and see if you can feel the gravitational tug of the small-business-crushing blackhole that is Walmart. As you make way through the no-doubt-strewn-with-blue-shopping-carts parking lot, remember: this isn't even close to the worst of it.

The action starts right away. In fact, I've never entered a Walmart without someone else simultaneously leaving. It's an endless loop of consumption: coming, going, buying, breaking, dawdling, vacuously staring, slowly dying. Think maggots on a decaying steak. Be prepared for sobbing children. You might be greeted by a man or woman in a blue vest who you will avoid but still want to embrace and tell them it's OK. You will be unable to get any help in the store. This is normal.

Once you have crossed the 20-foot long, three lane vestibule that is the antechamber to savings, you will have entered the no frills fluorescence that is Walmart. At a Supercentre you need only *ponder* a saleable item (a towel, a toaster, skis, a pear, eye drops, a step stool, a USB hot chocolate stirrer) and as God as my witness: it will be manifest. It will also  be of middling quality and priced so competitively you'll think you're at a garage sale, but you'll probably find it.

It would be foolish to attempt to distinguish this Walmart from others, and I shall not. A few positives (aside from their Olympic selection and human-rights-defying prices), are their sensible approach to the express queue (bank style), and their generous return and exchange policy.

Negatives include: their detrimental effect on small businesses in a community, their mostly-imported low quality merchandise, and the People of Walmart themselves. The POW effect is less pronounced in Canada than the US, but trust me, it's there.

In summary, if you can get it at Walmart, you can get it anywhere else. I recommend you do.

Obligatory Title Pun: All in all, it's just another brick in the WAL.

Menu Readability: Geez, even their logo is cheap.

Need to mention: Avoid any and every location in the month of December (or any time of year really).

What this place teaches me about myself: Not a damn thing.",2011-01-08 23:04:37

I ordered the Guacamole Burger with Sweet Potato fries - both were extremely good.  The burger was cooked just right and had tons of flavor.  The Guacamole ranked right up there with the best I've had with a nice blend of advocados, shaved red onions, and corn salsa.  The sweet potato fries were really good but there are other places in Charlotte that have better.  I did like the fact that they are hand cut and still had the skin.

I don't think this is the best burger joint in Charlotte but it definitely ranks up there.  If I were in the judging business - which I'm not - I would put Kickstand burgers a notch above Bang Bang.

A new addition to the Ohio City growing restaurant scene, I was pretty happy to see a sandwich place open up. Sometimes I just really want a hot solid fresh sandwich- and lo and behold, Herb n Twine appeared!

It's a cute space- maybe 4-5 tables, and it was completely full when we went for a late lunch around 2pm on Saturday. I ordered the Korean fried chicken sandwich, he got the meatball sandwich, and we got a cup of tomato bisque to top it off (hey, why not).

First of all- the BREAD. They use delicious, thick, crunchy bread- none of that soft, soggy, falling apart bread- the bread they use is good quality. It almost reminded me of banh mi bread- but slightly different. Nonetheless, the bread was delicious.

Second- the ingredients are fresh. Delicious and fresh!!

We were actually surprised how big our sandwiches were too. They were both very flavorful- I had kind of wanted my Korean fried chicken to be spicy (bc, well, most Korean anything is), which it was not, but it was still good. His meatball sandwich was really good meat as well.

The tomato bisque was delcious too- not too salty (which, being more of a broth soup kind of person, I personally dislikes super salty soups, so theirs was GREAT), which even came with almost garlic like type of bread croutons. I'm not sure what they were, but they sure were delicious in our soup!

Overall, I really liked this place for a solid sandwich- if you're looking for a quick and solid sandwich shop- deflinitely stop by Herb n Twine.",2016-01-30 04:46:31

I arrived late for lunch around 3pm and even at that late hr the place was active with people -a good sign. The place was well lit and I was offered a nice comfortable booth where I could spread out my paper and read. I even lucked out and was sitting across from a crying baby!! lol

 As I said, they are basically serving the same thing as other places with the difference here being Sweet Potato French Fries, fresh breaded shrimp & Fish with cocktail & tartar sauce available. They also had peeled shrimp on ice as well as whole fried shrimp and grilled shark. Also ""coconut chicken"" was offered but the chicken was more breading than substinance but the sauce was very good, they even have a fresh sushi station with several types of rolls available.

The desert station was pretty pedestrian with no standouts at all other than the small coconut cake squares they were offering were dry and stale which is nbd as I really wasnt there for desert.

I also got to see them putting out the dinner items such as the snow crab legs and while thin, they looked good.

You should definitely stop in for lunch and get the Piccola Gusto menu - it is a great deal and is plenty of food. You get to try so many awesome things, and it's possible for every component to be vegetarian! It is a way better deal than ordering any one item - they are pretty expensive.

I've also been to a dinner party catered there (in the nice outdoor tent area), and they had a great antipasti platter and various pastas we could try. There were actually multiple vegetarian options, which I really appreciated.

I would give this place a 5, but it would be nice if the vegetarian options experienced as much rotation/creativity as the meat ones. I love the mafaldine, but it is consistently the only veg pasta on the menu. But service, ambience, and food are all great.",2015-07-04 15:13:17

On the first day that the Yelp coupon was released I bought it and used it. When I checked out, the cashier was confused because I was the first one to use the coupon. I later discovered that she originally charged my cards for the full price, $34.18. She then charged my card for $26.04. I know my math skills are a little rusty, but that is not a $14.00 discount, plus I was charged twice. That is not where the major problem lies. 

The major problem was that I had to make several phone calls attempting to get a hold of the owner or manager. When I finally did get a hold of David he told me that he did not call me back because he did not know who I was or what I wanted. He also stated that I ""should have left him a message about what my concern was."" First David, you should call everyone back regardless of if they leave a detailed message. Secondly, I was not about to leave a detailed message because the person that answered the phone each time struggled with their English to the point that they could hardly handle my name and phone number. I have no problem with the fact that they struggled with English, but don't provide me with poor service by not calling me back because I didn't leave a message under these circumstances.

Here we are more than 2 weeks later and I still am struggling to get my money back. If the owner reads this, then it would behoove you to reach out to me to resolve this. We were so excited to have found your place just 2 months ago. We were on our way to being devout customers, but this might have changed that, primarily due to David's attitude with me.",2011-10-29 19:55:18

I have catered from OG numerous times 
to my work, and I have never been disappointed. For big group meals, OG is a great option. They have a huge selection of catering options so you are definitely always able to find something that will work for your group, whether 10 people or 100 people. 

We often order 1 or 2 pans of pasta, one of the big salads, and soup. They salad comes with their delicious bread sticks. Everyone can then choose what they want and have options. One thing I really like is that the pasta (most of them) comes with the sauce separately so people can decide for themselves how much they want. I personally don't like a lot of sauce when it's a red sauce, but do prefer it slathered on when it's a white sauce, so you can see how this is handy. 

Another huge benefit of OG is that I can place an order at 8:30AM and have it ready to be picked up by 11:15! That's awesome turn around and very uncommon in the catering world. I have had it delivered a few times (I usually just pick up as I am very close) and the delivery folks have always been on time, courteous and friendly. They set everything up very professionally and it looks great. 

And, they really are not very pricey when it comes to how much food you get! Overall, they are a great option and have helped me out many times when I was in a last minute pinch. 

Bonus - They allow you to order individual meals along with catering. A lot of places don't have this option. So if you have that ONE picky person who wants something different, they can choose a dinner meal and it will be no issue what so ever.",2017-10-24 20:17:24

They recommended I purchase online, and it would be shipped to me in a manner to protect the quality of the jerky. Which I plan to do when I get home! Jerky party! I did end up buying a large piece of the Hot Beef Jerky to take to go and munch on in the car...

First of all, while we waited outside for a table, a man stood right next to their fencing between Zinburger and Pomo and blew his cigarette smoke onto all the customers that were eating outside. Not a single employee at either restaurant said anything to him. After we were seated and ordered our food, another customer was seated alone outside. As soon as the hostess walked away, her male friend went into the patio area with a large dog. The dog jumped up onto the upholstered bench and then the girl's lap. The dog proceeded to sit at the table as customers inside watched and commented on how gross that was. As we waited for our lunch, we noted that every employee that walked passed this couple stopped to chat for quite some time. We're assuming the dog owner is also an employee because everyone seemed very friendly with her. Most of the employees also stopped to pet the dog, bring it water, feed it fries, etc. and then they would immediately serve food or fill water of other customers. One waitress (with her blonde hair in a knot, large black earrings, and a black and white headband) petted the dog on several occasions then brought food to customers, picked up a water pitcher and rubbed one hand all over the spout as she carried it, etc.  Next time I eat at Zinburger, I think I'll bring my pet ferret to run around the table and between customers' legs.",2017-03-03 22:12:09

I'm not a fan of this location because it smells and is always crowded. I like the one on Sahara better. I never would have canceled my husbands membership but did because of the lack of correspondence. I'm contacting my bank to get involved with the shady charges.

Service: 3/5
Food: 2/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Price: 1/5

My friend and I went to this place for dim sum just now, 2 hours ago. It has a decent review on yelp so we decided to try it out. We ordered 8 dim sum items, which amounted to approximately $60 after tax (that's ridiculous if you've ever had dim sum anywhere. It shouldn't be more than $15 per person in most Asian places). I'd gladly fork over $30 - $40 for a decent meal, however their food can be considered average at best. 

Highlight dishes:
- The pork and onion pancake thing wrapped in foil- that was good. I think it was about $5 or $6. A little pricey for the quantity but worth it. 
- We got a medium bowl of congee, crab meat and mushrooms or something, $12. Way too much starch, and I think a little heavy-handed on the MSG. I'm still chugging water. 
- The pan fried buns (sheng jian bao). OMFG those things were awful. Tasted undercooked, looked undercooked, and the too-thick dough didn't rise at all. Terrible. $5
- Shrimp Dumplings: $5 or $6. Edible compared to the buns, even a little above average in taste, but again, not quite worth it. 

The other dishes weren't even memorable, just some steamed bun or dumpling with something or other. Generally things you can find anywhere, and this place is starch-heavy on EVERYTHING. The dough is always too thick, even though the filling is seasoned nicely, it gets overpowered by a mouthful of dough. Honestly there's a place across the street called Rosewood Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum is $2/dish during happy hour, and the food is so much better than here. 

Service: waiter looked like he didn't want to be there, mumbled the dishes' names as he put them down, so we had to ask him to repeat it. Twice. Depressing man. 

The only thing that prevented me from giving it 1 star is the furnishing. The wall panels are quite beautiful. And the dipping sauce, but I mixed it myself so that doesn't really count. Though another thing: Their tables are quite small, so the two of us took up 2 of the 2-person tables.",2013-12-07 17:36:29

And now that paid parking is approaching, it's even more unappealing.

The strip is absurdly expensive due to revenue-sharing between the businesses and the casinos (about 1/3 of what you pay goes to the casinos), and it's full of mostly trailer-trash in shorts and flip-flops, and overweight Taylor Swift wannabes awkwardly walking around with what seems like concrete blocks for shoes, all pretending to ""live the dream"".

For those who have a brain, that ""dream"" is nothing short of a nightmare.

Their menu is very weird or uses unusual ingredients.  actually ingredients that not long ago were considered low end.   Beef tongue,  lamb brains, beef heart tartare and blood sausage!  Why try and make inferior cuts edible.  Are they afraid of competition from the many more competent restaurants?  Anyway we ordered the Nordini and some pizza with sausage and dandelions on it.  Then we ordered a $95 steak,  it takes an hour to cook and comes basically raw in the middle.   Barely brown on the outside.   Really under done for me and nothing special to speak of at all.

5LF0EB6Ob62QHFuyQ72TQQ,Pj9YpaP0T7A_5S_PT8IpNg,V2oe1HVgNK0He9Mf3Q17AA,5,0,0,0,"A long-time friend who takes me out to dinner every birthday asked where I wanted to go this year. I picked a place I never heard of called ""All Pierogi Kitchen"". Wow. What a treat! I (we) had dill pickle soup with kielbasa, onion and potato. Main course dishes included kapusta zasmazana, goÅÄbki, fresh homemade kielbasa, handmade pierogi (my choice was sauerkraut/mushroom and farmers cheese), placki kartoflane, and to drink a strong bitter soda pop made with rye bread. Thought we would have left-overs ... nope, not a crumb left.

All Pierogi Kitchen is located in a typical stripmall in Mesa. It's obvious they put some thought and effort into the place; it has a feeling of being well-established.  It feels very much family owned, which means some people will probably complain that they don't serve hamburgers and that their staff aren't pretentious pros.  There is no way you can fake ethnic foods from middle Europe, sorry, you can't just run down to Costco and buy a carton of pierogies. They have to be hand-made.  And unless you are an adventuresome person who routinely likes to try new and different foods, you are probably the opposite (like me) who was raised on these foods and you can't BS us ... it's either real and authentic or it's not.  And this place is real.

Now - is it as good as my mom or gramma used to make?  A bolt of lightning from Heaven would strike me down if I said it was as good, and yeah for me some of it was a little bland but not by a lot.  But I wasn't disappointed in anything except for one small quibble ... the ultra-tiny scoop of sauerkraut was ridiculously small. Sauerkraut is cheap and plentiful, why be so stingy with it?

Their menu isn't very deep, but that's okay, after all they do advertise that they specialize in pierogi. And some of their combinations left me wishing I could ""do it my way"" more ... and they make a big point of NO SUBSTITUTIONS, which is a shame at such a small place.

Price?  That's a quandary. Some people might find it slightly high. I didn't, you can and will pay a LOT more at places like Olive Garden, Denny's, Claim Jumper and other ""chain"" restaurants for me-too frozen food so I don't mind doing my part to keeping a local family business that cooks homemade fresh food in business. They need to make a profit because they can't buy truckloads of food at a time and in fact the percentage they pay for overhead is proportionately higher than national chains. I consider All Pierogi Kitchen's prices to be fair and the amount of food served to be a good value.

Oh yeah, one more thing. The accordion player. Try to be there when he is performing, he's very good and isn't so loud to be obtrusive. Everyone in the place seemed to know him and he was very friendly when he said hi to us.

Would I recommend anything to the owners?  Yes, two things ... please dim the lights a little.  And in winter please turn the heat up a little, our food got cold much too quickly in the chilly air.

All Pierogi Kitchen - highly recommended, will be back for sure.",2017-12-16 20:23:59

The bread basket consisted of a couple of pieces of tasty lavash and two rolls, one a walnut and raisin and the other I don't know because I didn't want to fill up on bread.  The butter comes with a piece of processed cheese spread with grapes and cranberries.  Very tasty!

I started with a house salad that comes with all entrÃ©es.  It's built almost like a small Cobb salad with greens in the middle and small mounds of diced tomato, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, hearts of palm, cucumber, and hard boiled egg around the perimeter.  I got bleu cheese dressing and the salad was very good.

My main course was the 8 ounce filet done black and blue.  With the steak came some summer vegetables cooked very little.  They were crispy and they were good!  I ordered a salted baked potato as a side.  My steak was done perfectly and the baked potato with that rich salt was very, very good.

For dessert, I got the Canal Street bread pudding with blueberries and a Bourbon whiskey vanilla sauce.  The bread pudding was different.   Not only was there the vanilla sauce, but the bread had a distinct chocolate infusion and there was chocolate sauce along with the vanilla.  Excellent.

Service was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking, finished dishes were removed promptly, and there was adequate time between courses to relax and enjoy the surroundings.  I wasn't rushed nor was service slow.

I like the room.  It has a New Orleans theme with one side being a mural.  In about an hour's time, the lights on the mural slowly dim and the fluorescent paint starts to glow with the blue lights and it looks like the lights in the mansion along the river or on the paddle wheel boat were turned on.  Then the lights slowly pick up and eventually it's daytime again.  I've always liked that ambiance and it was there again last night.",2012-09-10 18:57:28

Paired with the eggs and side of your choice, it's a pretty versatile and perfect dish for a hungry breakfast, lunch or dinner. The chicken souvlaki was similarly succulent, with all the salads, sides and tzatziki for a reasonable price. Note, there are not many options for vegetarians but there are options like a tofu sandwich, salads, etc.

You cannot beat the prices in Aldi... You just can't! $1 avocados, all the time?! You pay double that at giant eagle. I do wish they sold spinach though- last time I bought their romaine lettuce, it did not last more than two days. 

Simply nature is their organic, all natural line and it's awesome. I've bought their organic pasta sauce (and LOVE it, even more than trader joes ! :x), quinoa and agave... And love them all. Not only are they delicious but they would all cost double at giant eagle. Their organic pasta sauce is delicious and I can pronounce everything on the ingredients list. I used to love Trader Joes organic pasta sauce, until I discovered their was milk in it (why would you need milk in marinara?!) .. I found Aldi's brand to be cheaper and just overall more tasty and healthy! 

I also love their weekly specials on products for your home. I recently purchased a pack of three various sized cookie sheets for only $9. You would pay double that at Marshall's! I also recently purchased a pack of three various sized baking pans for $9 too, again, the price cannot be beat. Both high quality products as well!

All dishes are really tasty. Tastes even better when you get flavored soju as well. Most of the time this place is pretty consistent with their breading and taste, maybe I have encountered one or two times that there was too much breading but overall it was ok.

I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. 

We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. 

We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. 

We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. 

The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service. 

So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food.",2014-02-05 18:03:03

I don't tend to veer towards baja-Mexican cuisine, but was with a group so Cabo it was...and I was excited to try because, well, simply said, I'm a tequila girl. I was ready to get my hands on a nice blanco on the rocks...until I didn't. Why? Because I couldn't.

I asked if they had cazadores? Nope. I looked quickly at the margarita menu since there wasn't a tequila menu (still scratching my head about this), and ended up with El Jimador, which I took approximately 2 1/2 sips out of because I couldn't do it. No no, I wasn't going to let this ruin my tequila.

The girls' tacos looked fabulous but I went with a salad for two reasons: 1. I don't love soft shells 2. gluten and corn-free. The options for dietary restrictions aren't terribly limited here, but they aren't great. Nothing on the menu is labeled, so you definitely need to mention to your server specifications. You very rarely hear me complain about cost in reviews, I'm fine with spending on quality, but I thought $7 upcharge to add chicken was VERY high so considering my salad was over $16.00 but their other salad that happens to have chicken on it costs $12.50 and the salmon salad was $13.95.

Luckily they sat our large party very quickly even though only a couple people were there.  The service was outstanding and I am fairly certain our server was the only one in the two front rooms, I frequently observed him picking up and delivering food on both rooms to the left and right of the lobby including other large parties.  We started with the mini chimi platter pretty standard as an appetizer.  For my meal I usually get the chimichanga with chicken fajita filling, seasoned pieces of chicken peppers and onions, sour cream, guacamole rice and beans.  By the time you pay $2.25 extra for the chicken fajita filling its around a $15.00 chimichanga so it's a little pricey but so good.  Tonight I decided on the Chilequiles since I had never seen it in their menu before.  It is kind of a Mexican casserole with chicken cheese sour cream and green sauce this version said it had corn chips baked in, usually it is made with corn tortillas but I thought ""why not I love their chips"".  Let's start with the good news it was jam packed with shredded chicken that was moist and had great flavor.  Now for the bad the chips just turned into a soggy mush and the green sauce made it feel more like a thick chicken soup than a casserole.  The rice and beans were fantastic so after finishing those and the appetizer I was okay just picking at my soup.  2.5 stars for that dish due to the chicken everyone else's food was good now I just know what I can skip next time",2018-04-04 01:14:23

We parked and sat at one of the tables at dusk, with a nice breeze blowing.  I sipped on a large iced tea with extra ice and watched as she ate a chicken finger meal; she'd never been to Sonic even though she's been in Vegas longer than me (I've been here since 1992!)

KUDOS:
- They have two food items on the menu that I used to get all the time, but not so much any more:  root beer floats that you can request to be blended when you order (that's how I like 'em); and, tater tots. You can get the special fry sauce for the tater tots and fries, a combo of mayo and ketchup.  My son and I would come through the drive-thru at least once a week for blended root beer floats back in the day. It's comfort food, for sure, and oh so good!  
- The ice they put in their drinks is crushed, but there's something special, I don't know what it is.  It's so popular that they even sell it by the bag. 
- Sonic still has the old-school park and eat concept.  You can pull up, park, order over the intercom, and your order is brought out by someone on skates.
- Happy Hour for the drinks, of which there are plenty to choose from:  slushes, limeades, sodas, sweet or unsweetened iced teas (regular or green). 2:00-4:00pm

GRIPES:
- Really not healthy for you, but, hey, you don't come to Sonic to eat healthy.  Come here for some greasy burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries, tater tots, sundaes, floats, and anything else that will make you feel good when you need that kind of comfort.",2013-09-04 02:42:57

They warned me that r would be extra creamy and that it was... still delicious, but just very very creamy. It must have been the owner that noticed, but I probably had a look of discontent on my face. Not to mention I was gulping down my husbands drink. Completely out of the blue, the owner or manager came up to me with a new drink. A jasmine latte with boba and said that's how the drink should be if you add sea salt. The tea was so flavorful and delicious! It's really that small gesture that earned this place five stars. Well let's be real... I would have given them five stars because the drinks are incredible and the crepes are delicious, but I am such a fan of places that really take care of their customers.

A big bowl of egg noodles and beef in peanut sauce. It tastes like Filipino kare-kare but much watery and with noodles. 3.5/5

Short ribs (or you can get pork chop), kimchi, fried egg, Chinese sausage, and rice. A big plate that will not leave you hungry. The short ribs were flavorful and grilled. 4/5

I need places to plug in my laptop, get some work done in a creative environment and have a good mocha with my breakfast. I love the food at the Scottsdale location so am pleased this new location lives up to that standard. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy! It's sausage based I think, just the right amount of spice and pepper. It comes with your choice of eggs any way you like them. So good I tend to wake up in the morning thinking about their biscuits and gravy. Dang...I want them now!
Sip is literally in a garage. An old Jiffy Lube. It's so nice to have the doors open on a nice day. After a few visits you will wonder why all Jiffy Lubes are not turned into a Sip Coffee and Beer Garage. Took my wife on Sunday and we enjoyed the live music. 
Sip has something for everyone. I've been there and have noticed hipsters to my right at the bar. A mom and her 4 year old across from me. To my left students working on their laptops. And next to them two elderly ladies stopping by for a good breakfast. 
Beer drinkers will also love the choices. There's a board on the wall with a list of beers and some look quite interesting. I wonder what Big Sky Moose Drool is? I'm not a beer guy so I cannot review that aspect of Sip. What I can review is the excellent concept of Sip and their tasteful interior decor, pleasant staff, and tasty biscuits and gravy with side of eggs and choice of bacon or sausage. 
I'd love to write another four paragraphs about the house burger as well! So good! I'll post a pic and let you decide for yourself. 

Here is my update on March 17th. Sip no longer serves biscuits and gravy. What! I guess not enough people read my review and just had to have biscuits and gravy. So now it's gone. Way to go people. I guess you're all going there for the beer. So now I have no interest in a breakfast sandwich, even though it is pretty good. Breakfast potatoes are good too. What I am interested in is the chicken avacado sandwich. It's my new favorite!

To start off, we had bread. It was warm and soft. Then house salad, sadly it was soaked in the vinaigrette. Then the main dish, steak with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. Well cooked, and super delicious. Our table had wine, which was a bit too strong for my taste, so afterwards I ordered my favorite cocktail, whiskey with ginger ale.

Food was brought out almost immediately, great flavor & quality. Sushi was MOSTLY fish, not MOSTLY rice - it's rare that you find this. My large miso soup was LARGE - enough for two days. All portions were a very nice size.

Upon checking out, the woman in the front was pretty much telling off our waitress because she forgot to add my wine to the check - ridiculous if you ask me. They made us swipe our credit card again to pay for the wine - while the woman was still yelling at our server. Honestly, that was the only thing that I could say that was an issue this evening.

I had the Weiner Schnitzel with spaetzle and sauerkraut. For $20 I expected a bit more. Size is a 3 dimensional measure. The ""area"" is certainly large, but the thickness is very lacking. Or perhaps that's intentional to keep the schnitzel crispy? I don't know since I'm no schnitzel expert. But I do know that this thing is not worth $20 in my books. The spaetzle and sauerkraut were ok. The schnitzel itself was pretty good. But I'd prefer something more like Tonkatsu which is definitely crispier. Tonkatsu is about half the price at most Korean/Japanese places. The seasoning were good but neither the schnitzel or the sides were things I would crave.

I'm not giving up on this place yet. I won't order schnitzel again but might try the other things like sausages or peirogies. $20 and not including a drink is a lot to ask imo for something not so difficult to make.",2015-10-23 19:00:42

I have been coming here for years and I have brought in so many more customers for this place personally that I introduced this place to all my close friends when they would always walk by n straight to Starbucks next door . This place was shut down for 3 months due to not able to pay store rent in 2009-2010,i try to help n come more.

I hv had 2 separated incidents in this place that disgruntle  employees are being rude. First time was in summer, when I just adopted a small Yorkie puppy that he was only 4 months old weight 4 pounds at time. when I was looking into the store window, a couple at patio liked my puppy so much offered to look after him at end side of patio in exchange that they get to pat him. my puppy is very small dude and he doesn't bark or bite. So instead of tying my puppy to the patio pole I left to the couple who's enjoying coffee at their patio chair. I quickly ran in to try to get my big usual chocolate chunk cookie asap but there was a line up that I had to line for about 5 minutes. During that time I kept checking on puppy on the patio window trying to make sure everything is okay. I got the cookies n were about to come out, a women (first I thought was a man first) with very shirt hair like buzz cut came up screaming (in a very public harsh n grunting voice, EXTREMELY DEGRATING) : ""YOU KNOW YOU ARENT ALLOWED TO HAVE DOGS IN PATIO?"" I was in shock wasn't because I was wrong was it was so unforsceen n someone shouted at me out of nowhere in public. The line of people standing beside me were like""what's going on"". She rambled something else after in the same mannar, I don't remember what she said but was definitely VERY SELF RIGHTES AND CONDESENDING, her face reassemble with some with heartrate. I quickly grab my stuff n left . Feeling very HURT. I brought in SO MANY more customers when I developed a liking to this place. I brought at least 10 friends here to have them try this place n telling how good their cookeis are. And what I got was being LECTURED IN FRONT OF MASS AUDIANCE! I thought it was fine I had my puppy tied up in patio , he was pocket size clearly would do no harm. I only had him for a month it was my first dog I had no idea about patio laws prior. Just come up pull me aside to give me heads up, instead of yelling cross the room in public! This is Canada for god sake, what are ppl's manners. 

I didn't come to the bakery for a month after that incident. Just left a very sour taste after that time n makes me cringe every time I walk by the store. 

Finally time heals wounds, one day I passed by I decided to bring some cookie to friends and I walked in. I mentioned an employee n asked who was that short hair manly person that's so angry. Not saying trying to bash her looks, u really have no idea if she is a man or not just by looking at her. They confirmed that she is a chef at location, not the boss, also a VERY grumpy person to work with n didn't know why she would come to the front to yell at customers because she was suppose to stay at back. So I left at that assume she was having a bad day and came to the front and saw something she didn't like n happened to yell at me. 

Second incident is its a few months apart, I came in one day before store closing. They had full tray of baked pear and apple pastries. I was normally getting a cookie but decided to take a tart too. The lady was annoyed when I asked her how much it was, it was mildly annoyed. Then I kinda debated between the two tarts, when I finally decided to go with pear, she grabe me a small dry piece from the edge of the tray. I don't like dry pastries so I asked her to switch to a middle piece. then she tried to shovel the tart n cookie in the same white small tinny paper bag I had to request please put them in separate bag, and toss in a plastic bag too because their pastries are greasy n they always soak through paper bag . She was increasingly irritated n I could tell she was thinking I gave her hard time on purpose. The final bill came $8.91 something which was like wow! for a cookie and small piece pear thing! I double asked her how much it was for the tart, she was like : $4.99. when I say the tart. I guess its called tart, its like 2.5x2.5 x0.8 inch high flaky crossant like texture pastry. it was like $5.61 I ate the whole thing in 4 bites. I was suspicious of if she over charged me so I asked how much it was she said :""$5.99

last night I came to the location to get a cookie they had the exact same thing and she was there too. after I bought a cookie I asked her how much that pear pastry was. she was like:$3.99! Bang 

This place has great pastries and great coffee. However I would not want to stay here. They seem to have high turn over of store front employees who don't take their job seriously. They also have angry employee at back comes to front to throw a tantrum at ""young looking face"" customers. Its totally not acceptable.",2016-02-12 14:03:36

However, since changing their name to ""Tandoori House,"" they have reduced the size of their lunch buffet significantly, and food is not replenished once emptied.

Did I go to the prison cafeteria or an Indian restaurant? 

The staff was very nice, but they did not offer any kind of drink other than water.

We came in on a Sunday late morning and the place was packed. We lucked out though as someone was leaving right when we came in so a table wait was nonexistent. The place is small (with a ""patio"" sorta), we chose to eat inside. 

It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress. My mother tried to ask for 1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 orange as her drink, the waitress glared at my mom like she was from outer space. I was pissed about her behavior after she walked off without another word but she seemed to come back a few minutes later with a MUCH better attitude that she held on to for the rest of our service. But at the start, she was a total bunt (replace that with a ""c""...)

Our breakfast was blah. No flavor, no fun, no creativity. We were super excited to try the sweet potato tots and these were the biggest disappointment. They were dry, tasteless, hard. I rarely have the willpower to say no to a carb-not only did I say no to these, it was a HELL NO.

I also brought my 8 year old daughter to sign her up for lessons as she has been showing interest in archery lately. When we walked in we were greeted by nobody. Checked out the thin inventory on their wall and was finally asked what we needed by an employee. I told him I would like to buy a new bow. He said give me a minute. I have him 30 minutes and finally my daughter and I decided to leave. He watched us walk out and did not say a word.  Crazy. Afterwards I was so distraught I reached out to them with a comment on social media describing my experience and my comment was soon after deleted with no response and no message to me.

Great for lunch or dinner.  Get the guacamole made at your table, sooo yummy!  My favorite dish is the chicken mole enchilada. If you have never tried mole, this is the place to do it.  It is so rich with flavor.  I tried something else once and it didn't even compare to the mole enchiladas, so I pretty much just stick to that dish every time.  They also have a great Sunday brunch menu, but I never get up early enough to try it out!

The margaritas are STRONG, I get pretty happy with just one.  They also serve warm(as in temperature)  and cold salsa with the chips.  They both are fantastic. 

One funny thing I noticed, every waiter/waitress I've ever had has an accent.  Either they only hire Spanish speaking people or they tell them all to fake an accent so the place feels more authentic!

Oh, I almost forgot...

I have to say I will NEVER go back to this place again!!!! I don't know if management has changed but I can tell you that the service here has been continuously declining over the past year and TONIGHT was the W-O-R-S-T!!!! They definitely need to have 2 people behind the sushi bar because the one person thing just doesn't cut it. Even when the place is almost empty, it takes FOREVER to get your sushi. 

We've lived in Goodyear now for almost 7 yrs, meaning when we first moved to this side of the valley there were no restaurants, especially sushi places until the last 3 yrs maybe. When this place first opened we were so excited because it was much closer to home, at the time the service was excellent and fast, and the quality and quantity was worth the price. Forget that! You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi. 

We ordered a total of 4, count them, 4 rolls tonight. The first roll was delivered rather quickly. Nice surprise, however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently. The second roll, again, not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 5-10 minutes later. Wow, we thought. Service seems a little better than last time. BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT!!!!!!!! Holy crap, sat waiting for almost another 30-35 minutes watching all these other orders going out for people who came in some time AFTER, yes I said AFTER, we did but not our 2 measly rolls. 

We also had to be our own server when it came to refilling our drink. Server never came back to refill so I got up and refilled our drinks myself. Too bad we didn't order alcohol because i would have gone back to get that as well. 

I finally decided I had had enough and we got up to leave. When I was approaching the female server to ask for a bill for the sushi we did get and explain the situation she walked right by me like I was invisible or something. She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her, she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well. When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something. Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register, kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order, wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible. She said OK thank you, so we walked out. 

Hey, wait a minute, I think they owe me money since I had to play waitress.

We were a group of six hungry diners who were ready to eat. We ordered caesars and red stripes, a round of appetizers, mains and sides. The server was not able to give a recommendation and seemed terribly confused. Our apps came without a hitch, the catfish layfeyette (battered and fried catfish) was moist and well seasoned with two dipping sauces, but the crawfish in chilies was underwhelming and overly finicky for the taste experience. 

Our server seemed to stop noticing us at this point, we had difficulty having drink orders fulfilled. When our mains arrived they hadn't remembered to order one of them. The rest of us awkwardly ate our entire meal while our friend waited for almost 20 minutes for his food. There was no profuse apology or rush to get it out once they realized their mistake. 
The fried chicken was good enough, but waffles and gravy was stone-cold. The mac n' cheese was bland. The best part of the meal was the coleslaw, which isn't enough for me to want to return. 

To top it all off, groups of 6 or more have an automatic tip on the bill - when the main didn't arrive, we expected it to be discounted at the very least and we did not intend on tipping the full amount. After we asked awkwardly, they deducted 50% of the main from the bill. So much drama when all we wanted was some good ol' fried chicken.",2010-11-23 18:36:34

The decor reminds me of a cozier Cento. Love the booths (they remind me of little cabanas). I love that you can see them cooking, too!

Fun, friendly and helpful servers.

So the menu reminds me of the menu at A Pig in a Fur Coat in that it's mostly smaller plates designed for sharing. However, in practice, most of the dishes at Graft are not actually shareable. I think the main difference in the actual food between Graft and PIAFC is that the Graft food is not quite as decadent so you actually want more than a bite. However, my group of 4 shared a lot of dishes and we really only got a tiny bite of each. We left hungry and still paid a lot. Each dish was like $5 per bite.

We loved most of the food, though! I think I would just go back with one other person and be prepared to spend a lot. 

Favorites include the beef tartare, flank steak and ravioli. The macaroni and cheese was the only thing I didn't like. Too smoky, but people apparently love it.

I ordered the chicken tacos on corn tortillas with a salad. The salad was pretty typical of any restaurant chain. The tacos were great but need to be eaten quickly as corn tortillas do not hold up as well as flour ones and the insides started busting through the bottoms soon after I started eating (I made the mistake of having the salad first).

Checkin on yelp and you'll get 50% their Yuzu soda...which is a must try....very refreshing.

The owner/head chef, chef Kiichi was so nice and accommodating. My friend and I weren't too hungry when we came and only intended to have some appetizers since this was our 3rd stop of the evening so Chef Kiichi offered to do half orders of the entrees for us so we could try multiple dishes. 
You can tell how genuine he is from how much he cares about his restaurant and his customers. He took the time to tell us about his experience in the restaurant industry and his Japanese origins. Chef Kiichii loves his restaurant and effortlessly offers a great experience for those who are fortunate enough to try his dishes. 

We had the spicy mackerel which was just delicious. The Karaage which was pretty amazing as well and you get a good sized portion for $5.00 (Appetizers are usually overpriced and quite small in my opinion...not the case) We also had the house dumplings which were lightly fried for that slight crisp...just delightful.

I highly recommend trying this place out. You will not be disappointed.

Well, you probably can, just not at the prices you'll find here at La Bonita 

During my last visit, the manager was standing at the door after he just hauled in some carts to greet his customers. My daughter was trying to show off her Spanish and the manager was very impressed. It is nice to see someone from management helping out the team & still greeting shoppers with a friendly smile. 

I usually check out the produce, because who doesn't love cheap, good quality fruits & veggies?! 

Another favorite is the meat section. I occasionally like to have a fiesta con carne asada con mis amigos! So I usually stop here for my meats, rice, beans & other yummy goodies. I love the marinated flank steak! La Bonita definitely blows any other store out the water as far as quality. 

The workers are definitely extremely hard working & always helpful. My Spanglish isn't all that great, but I've never had any issue with any product I needed. Plus, it's a nice way to brush up on my conversation skills. They definitely appreciate my effort! 

And last but not least, the fruit juice bar! You can select your own fruits for them to juice right in front of you. I opted for the watermelon & it was quite a treat for a hot day. 

It's conveniently located in Spring Valley on Rainbow & Flamingo across from the Sprout's Market.

Welcome Poke Guys to Markham! The first poke bowl location in the hood! I am excited! No more just drooling over poke bowl food photos and going all the way to Toronto to have one of this treat!

Located in Downtown Markham, underneath a Condo development. Parking might be a little challenge but there are some street parking or you can utilize the Condo's business parking underground.

Menu is the same as downtown. For my first visit, I tried the Cali Bowl ($11.25). I love how fresh the toppings! Especially my avocado was freshly cut when ordered, no brownish and bruised sad looking avocado. The only flaw maybe the white rice which was dry and hard and lack seasoning.

Service started out fast in which we were seated immediately during the dinner rush, and drinks and salads came out pretty soon after we ordered. We were disappointed that they ran out of the Italian sausage ravioli so we tried the grilled chicken penne asiago. Additionally, we ordered a regular sized medium rare prime rib to share. The pasta was decent but definitely overpriced. There were barely any chicken pieces and the entree was a bit salty. Sadly this was when the service went downhill. We didn't receive our prime rib until 30 minutes later since we ordered it. The wait was so long that we expected a delicious prime rib. We were disappointed when it finally arrived at our table. I have to admit that the prime rib I made last week was definitely better...I'm not even joking.

When we were deciding on a restaurant to check out, one of the criteria was a place that neither of us had tried before. Well, I failed on that. Hence the review update. But that previous visit was just to the lounge to watch The Skooners play. I had never dined at Brand before.

Let it be known that I'm pretty cheap. RW doesn't normally interest me. So with that in mind, I have to give up the five stars to Brand. Everything was excellent (to my admittedly unrefined palate).

1st course: Onion Soup - 24 Hour Caramelized Onion, Four Cheese Gratin
I don't know that I've had a lot of onion soup in my life, but this was a tasty start to the meal, especially since I was recovering from a little cold.

2nd course: Chilean Sea Bass - Lemon Risotto, Rock Shrimp, Lobster Broth
The fish was perfectly flaky. The risotto had great flavor, but wasn't quite perfect. Granted, I just had the best risotto in my life the previous week up in Napa Valley. Still, it was an excellent main course.

3rd course: Grilled Banana Smores - Coconut Peanut Butter Sauce, Vanilla Ice Cream
O. M. G. Each course of this meal just kept one-upping the previous. Talk about a creative and delicious dessert. As Angela H described, it's cracktastic! Think of a grilled whole banana filled with chocolate and topped with marshmallows, and served with graham crackers, peanut butter, more chocolate, and some ice cream. It's truly redonkulous.

Apparently, Brand has a happy hour from 5-7pm. I think our next plan of attack is to check out the HH and just order some more of that grilled banana goodness!",2012-03-01 19:55:24

Ok now that we've covered the only negative from our experience I'd like to describe how amazingly delicious our food was. The customer service is outstanding and they greet you as soon as you set foot in the restaurant. The aromas will smack you in the face the moment you walk in and you'll notice the hard working chef juggling phone calls and tasting his food assuring it's just right! 

 I ordered the small Curry Chicken and it was PERFECT! Not overpowering and tender and flavorful! The potatoes and carrots were so good that I wish I had ordered the large portion. 

The Ox Tail has nothing to be envious of as it was EXCELLENT! The presentation is beautiful and the quality of food is evident after your very first bite. 

The Chef will check on you to make sure you're enjoying the meal which is an indication of how focused they are with satisfying their customers.

It was noodles that were hard shaped into a bird's nest. On top of the noodles are different meats, vegetables, and a slimyish gravy. You need the gravy to make the noodles soft. As far as taste, it wasn't strong and was similar to what you might have in a light Chinese dish. The texture of the gravy threw me for a loop. Nothing remarkable, good or bad. The spring rolls are different as they are wrapped in rice paper, not fried and are very fresh. While they may not look appetizing, it's like a mini salad rolled up in an easily edible format.

I ordered regular noodles with grilled pork and spring rolls. The spring rolls were good and the noodles weren't too mushy or anything. The meat, however, was extremely salty. I had a hard time finishing that bowl to be honest. 

I usually like to mix in the spring roll sauce which is basically fish sauce with sugar and picked veggies. They don't have that here. They have a fish sauce container that doesn't have that sweet, tangy delicious taste. Most other Viet places make that sauce in house so it's a bit different everywhere. I didn't enjoy the bottled sauce here though. It was just really salty and no other flavor. 

The staff here are very very friendly though and are happy to hear what you think at the end of the meal. It looks like they have a few Chinese style dishes as well so definitely can give them a try. We tried the black bean sauce on fried ho fan (flat noodles) and short ribs. Again it was salty, but also the meat seemed to have been tenderized with some acidic mixture so it's soft.

So first off, the value that you get for your money here just blows me away.  Basically, you're paying the same prices as Subway but getting a MUCH MUUUUUCH better gourmet legit sandwich.  I love that they're super accommodating, and will customize any sandwich for you, toast it, do different bread--- whatever you want!

My favorite is the pressed TCB (with the original toppings + black olives), but the Reuben, the ham/cappicola/chz, and the Italian are all awesome too.  

During the course of us eating here, I've actually gotten pregnant, and I LOVE the fact that they toast my sandwiches up to the proper temp so I can still eat them :).

It was a fun show to watch, and definitely had a good laugh that evening! This theatre often brings in quality comedy shows and talented performances throughout the year... it is a nice way to spend an evening together with your family or with your date ;) hehehe...

Bought my tickets online at http://www.markham.ca/wps/portal/Markham/RecreationCulture/MarkhamTheatre/

Just login, pick your show and time, choice your seats, check out, and print your tickets :) It was very straight forward, and easy to use! Sometimes, they do have special deals going on. It will be noted on that particular show's information page, but you'll have to call in to reserve those tickets (Ex. Family of 4 for $100, Regular tickets can range from $30 to $40+ per person depending on the show). Also, please note that there will be a handling fee + $2 charge on each online purchased ticket.... (sucks, but I didn't want to go there and pick it up!)

Upon arrival 1/2 hour before the show, it was already packed! So be sure you get there early to find your seats, and to pick up a snack or a drink or two :) Ooo btw, there are plenty of parking space, so no worries if you're coming a tad late!

It is a small cozy theatre. They have a good sound system. Staff there are very friendly and courteous, we didn't have to wait long in line to get in. They did advertised that there are no bad seats in the theatre, but I found that I was blocked by this tall, tall man that evening (maybe I'm just too short.... sigh!) If you can, go for the premium seats... only $5 more if i remember correctly! Premium seats are much closer to the stage or they are balcony seats (you get your own little balcony... seats 4 people!) #worthyourmoney

Enjoy your next show :)",2013-03-19 02:18:56

Some are great others are not, but one this is true is that they all offer cheap eats. In this case we have an oddity, a fairly expensive hot dog stand offering poor food.

OK I know this place is an iconic Pittsburgh institution but the food is sorely lacking. First of all if you want a dog or two and some fires you have to stand in two different lines, so either you dogs get cold or your fries get gold while you are waiting for the other. LAME.

Second complaint the dogs are cooked on a griddle where they sit and sit and sit drying out, my idea of a hot dog is not a semi-blackened piece of jerky meat, it should he juicy and succulent. It's too bad that they ruin their dogs this way, getting past the dried out part the taste of this dog would have been pretty good if prepared correctly

Third complaint the buns - what is with east coast people and their feeble wonder bread buns they serve hot dogs on? You have two main components: The dog and the bun, both of these should be of high quality if you skimp on either one you will have a sub-par hot dog.

Fourth complaint - complete and utter disorganization of ordering, waiting and paying for your dog. You would think that some genius would be able to how to figure out and streamline the process to make it more efficient. Also hire some employees with some personality the three that were there seemed to hate their jobs.

Fifth complaint - $ 7.75 for two regular dogs (this was a special too) and a drink is ridiculous, throw in fries and I'm over $10 bucks - that's highway robbery for what was served.

FOOD 1.5 stars - it's hard to screw up a hot dog but they did it
SERVICE 1.5 stars - I think if anybody smiled their face would have fallen off.
VALUE 1 star, OK I have to give at least 1 star according to yelp otherwise this would be zero.

This Roberto's has a drive-through (yay!), but the food was just as lame as I remembered it :(

I brought my meal home to eat. Good thing, because it would have been an unholy mess trying to eat my order in the car! I got a beef taco and a chicken quesadilla with guacamole. I appreciate the freshly made taco shell, but the meat was really tough. (I must say I am not a fan of shredded beef tacos, so maybe if I would have gotten ground beef, it would have been better. But I didn't see that as an option on the menu...) The quesadilla was HUGE--maybe that's how they justify the $7 (with guac) price tag. But the chicken was bland; the peppers were undercooked; and the whole thing was really greasy. I only ate half, and I didn't even give the rest of it to my dog, because I was afraid it might make him sick.

I did notice some out-of-state license plates in the parking lot while I was waiting in the drive-through, so maybe they get a lot of tourist traffic. And I do know several locals who swear by Roberto's. I guess it's just not the right Mexican food for me.",2016-06-12 00:16:26

Wvrst has been open for about 4 weeks and I now know why its already getting so much buzz - the sausages are yummy!

I came here after work at about 5pm to a rather empty restaurant.  Set-up in true beer hall fashion with communal tables and a bar - it is quite a spacious restaurant!

I ordered the Currywurst with a Kranjska sausage (think Kielbasa), a root beer, and side of duck fat fries with Rosemary Maple dip.  My DC had the duck sausage on a whole wheat bun with caramelized onions and sauerkraut.

If you try nothing else, just try the Currywurst.  It was DELISH!  It had a curry flavor to it with the tanginess and acidity of the tomato which made for an interesting melange of flavors.  It is served as a sliced up sausage topped with curry sauce and 2 slices of bread.

The duck fat fries were disappointing as they tasted like normal fries to me.

The duck sausage with maple foie gras was also yummy.  The hot dog bun is very fresh, crusty and tasty!  I found the onions and sauerkraut overpowered the flavor of the actual sausage as both were quite powerful toppings in their own right.

The root beer was pretty sick!  Made with 100% Cane Sugar - it was not a cavity-wrenching sweet.  The Pilsner that the cashier recommended was also top notch.

Verdict:

All in all, I think that Wvrst is a unique new restaurant on the Toronto scene.  I mean, we all dole out almost $4 for the street-vended sausages - why not pay a few more bucks for more exotic options?  I will definitely be back to try the bison, guinea fowl and pheasant varieties.  Kangaroo anyone?  

It should be noted that the small fries usually only comes with one dip, but the cashier did say I could have 2 - but in the end, they only brought one.  

Condiments are aplenty at every table with 3 different types of mustard (regular, dijon and grainy) as well as ketchup.  

At the end of the day, for a beer, a root beer, 2 sausages and a small fries, $33 does seem rather steep - but I left feeling quite full!  It may not be the best, but its not the ""Wvrst""!  This would be a great place to go with a group of friends - good times are guaranteed!",2011-06-29 13:24:50

Walking in, the decor and ambiance is very home-y and casual. Many times, when I enter restaurants, the environment plays a big role with my experience. I'm happy to say that this place gave off a ""I'm comfortable and ready to chow down and loosen my belt without judgement"" type of vibe. 

We were immediately greeted with smiles and enthusiastic hellos from the staff. It wasn't very busy at 1pm on a Monday afternoon. There were 3 of us. I'm the local one and the other two from out of town. We sat down and waters came out immediately. I have a 1-2minute mark on waters being brought out.

The menu at this place is expansive. We chose to order crispy pata binagoongan, kare-kare and pork sisig. 

The kare-kare came out first. 
The creamy, peanut butter sauce and the oxtail in that dish was just perfect. I'm picky with my kare-kare because my mom creates and crushes peanuts to create the family sauce recipe BUT I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed D'Pinoy's approach on this dish as well. 

The pork sisig came out next; this dish steamed and sizzled from the moment it left the kitchen. We wondered how our waittress carried it to our table with all the amazing flavors crackling. The sisig had the perfect crunch, crack and pop lol. The sour and savory flavors mixed well. It may have been slightly too hot due to the pork sticking slightly to the sizzle pan.

Last but not least was the crispy pata binagoongan. This dish is huge. 3 of us together could not finish it. It was definitely crispy, full of meat and absolutely delicious. The pork skin wasn't rubbery. The binagoong on it was drizzled; you can order it on the side but I believe it's always better to just have it all mixed in. 

The service was great at this restaurant. Staff was making jokes and really providing a fun and family-style atmosphere. We definitely needed boxes so they provided those. Check came out. Payment was easy (they don't take discover cards). 

We left with full stomachs and the desire to come back. We were going to check out red canyon and we HAD to go home to make sure we left the leftovers in the fridge. It was THAT good.

""The Lakes"" is a beautiful community, so we were definitely wanting to check out a restaurant surrounding the lake. We landed on ""Lakes Lounge"".

The outside of the restaurant is ""vintage"", if you will, like something you would see outside a boat yard in Santa Monica. It was a nice change of scenery, compared to everything else in Vegas. 

We walked in and grabbed a comfy booth. Our server was Margaret, and she was very nice. I asked for her opinion on some items, and I narrowed it down to their ""Famous Chicken Pot Pie""(refer to pic). I added a ""House Salad""(refer to pic), for $1.99, which was delicious. When the pot pie came out, it looked incredible! It was gigantic, and had a beautiful, buttery, layer of crust on top that makes your mouth water, just wondering what treasure you'll discover inside. MmmMm, is what I was thinking, while patting myself on the back for the good choice. As soon as I put my spoon to the crust, it was like a symphony! Beautiful sounds of perfectly baked, fluffy crust, flaking so effortlessly apart, but this is where the symphony had a few miss notes, and maybe a sneeze or two from the conductor. The pot pie looked as though is was made with an over abundance of heavy cream, which was odd to see.  From the first bite the pot pie was so overpoweringly creamy, I was literally hoping it was a joke.. like, that is what they do here. They give you a terrible first bite and then the food is incredible. This was not the case, unfortunately. I couldn't eat more than 10 bites(refer to pic). It was very disappointing, because I'm a hugh lover of pot pie's.

After not eating much, Margaret brought over some boxes for my sons food and she took mine away, saying, sorry she wished I had enjoy it more. I didn't ask for it to be removed from the bill, but she was awesome enough to give that kind of guest service, where she knew it was needed. Thank you Margaret, I appreciate it. They definitely have integrity, and i will always try a place again when they show that. 3 stars for now. I will definitely be back for some different items.",2013-01-27 21:04:14

Sunday brunch includes: buffet, an a la carte entree, and sides. I have been here a couple of times for brunch and we love the buffet food and waffles, the entree can be a hit or miss depending on how crowded it is. I usually stick with the chicken and the egg entree, the shrimp and grits are good too but, the gravy has pork in it. Yes, it is a little pricey, but its worth it. My favorite buffet item: mussels with white wine butter sauce! The sausage gravy and flatbreads are also very good. The servers are always very attentive and nice. 

This is definitely a try at least once despite the price. Spencer, the GM, is great and very accommodating. He will make sure that you have a wonderful experience at Heist.

Massage here will be more like a full body massage with more emphasis on foot reflexology.

(For those that are not deep tissue type of people, they ask to make sure the pressure is OK for you).  The massage was the right amount of pressure for me, and for less than $30 an hour, I will definitely be coming back here for more massages, even when the regular price is in effect.

Across the river, I found a home, place where not everyone may know my name, but where they all share the same obsessive love affair with the same music I do. 

After months of being coaxed into attending some shows at Pittsburgh's smaller venues for a change, I made it a point to catch the loaded line-up of Mud City Manglers, Argus, Carousel, and the headliners, Chicago's High Spirits, and it was an experience that rivaled a religious awakening. 

I must have struck up conversations with at least 5 people simply over the vintage Scorpions t-shirt I had on, and this was before I got into the concert venue itself! 

Adjacent to the the bar, the stage is anterior to the ex-storefront, meaning bands can get their equipment in and out through the back of the stage onto the sidewalk without having to navigate narrow corridors. And until the glass gets fogged up, one can watch the concert from outside, window shopping for rock if you will. 

The sound was tremendous, the camaraderie was unmatched, and the loud, sultry, voltaic fun had was staggering, all underneath a quilt of old t-shirts within a humble dive that for too long I dismissed. 

New friendships were formed, older ones reinforced, brains were rattled, spines tingled when familiar songs began their strains -- for several hours I was in my Avalon, my Valhalla, my element. 

I had a more enjoyable concert experience here than I have at ones held at much bigger, state-of-the-art facilities. No fireworks, light, fog, or stage props were necessary. 

It was Saturday night alchemy. 

It was Howlers, and I need to be here more often. A friend of mine lives just around the corner. How privileged he is...

I had a great experience at Hobak.  Even after months of being open, the lines are always incredible.  There will be a wait and they do not take reservations, just just be aware.  But once you get to the table you have a perfect meal with tons of food at a reasonable price.  This is a great venue to take friends from out of town, the family, or even as a date night.  

We had the pork and beef marinated platter.  Cooked for us to perfection, this is for sure not a ""2 person"" plate like the menu states.  With drinks and bonchon, this is easily a 3 person, or probably a 4 person platter.  They have the typical soju as well.  Service was good and the waiter was actually talking it up as he was cooking so it wasn't awkward or anything which is nice at a place like this.

My main issue with Hobak was that it was Americanized.  They didn't have many of the sauces and bonchon options that you would see at a more authentic place and instead stood firm with sriracha as their hot sauce and bok choy as their veggie.

Highly recommended by them, and they said ""It's the place to go if you have cervical/spine issues and may need treatment."".

I was referred to Dr. Theodore, but he was not taking patients. So I went to their website and they have a nice filtering option to filter by insurance company.  I selected Dr. Andrew Little.  He has a fantastic bedside manner.  He was very informative, and I had done my own research online, and he covered all of that in his communication.  He also answered all of my questions sufficiently and as much as he could.

He provided many options and when I asked for his recommendation on the first option, he provided his input.  

I would recommend BNI.  They are know worldwide and I knew their name from recognizing it.  And my medical student friend and her peers' recommendation helped solidify my decision to go here.

The facility is far from me, but I am willing to travel for the best treatment for myself.  It is a large facility with ample hallway and examination rooms.  They have an option to video your consultation and you can view it over and over or send it to other people for viewing.  This is very helpful as I was going to take notes to remember what he said, but now I have the details captured.

Now I know the purpose of the food trucks is to be mobile and to be out and about around the city, it is a great way to try them all and to experience new and tasty food. But lets all be honest, it's awesome that there is a stationary food truck and it is Awesome (capital A) that that truck is Steak Out.
Okay now to talk about Steak Out, it's excellent. Done. Review over. 
The steak is so tender and juicy and delicious. The steak fries are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. All of the items on the menu are gently flavoured, they are created on the basis that the ingredients being used are tasty on their own. Having a steak sandwich add some grilled onions, another great simple flavour. So good and tasty. It is based on the opinion that the Steak Out (/Holy Grill) people know what they are doing. How can you beat that? I enjoy the Steak Out more than I enjoy steak at some (lower case s) steak restaurants. I won't name names on that subject.

I went with a friend and the owner came by, introduced herself with a very limp handshake and regaled us with the specials, both of which sounded good.  I'm pretty sure she only stopped by because I was laughing at the Moroccan crepe on the menu.  The description said it had a ""chicken and tajine stew.""  A Tajine is an earthenware cooking vessel in which you prepare stew, so to have it ""and"" means you'll be eating a cooking vessel (there's a few other items on the menu that make it clear they really have no idea what they're talking about).

When the waitress came by to take our order my friend chose the Chicken Provencal special and I chose the Pastrami special.  Neither of which the waitress was at all familiar with.  Luckily for her the Chef was right behind us.  Then the chef outright stated she had no idea what we were talking about.  Lovely.

The waitress goes on to helpfully state that the owner liked to come up with stuff on the spot.  Which is great if she's in the kitchen making it but not when she does it while glad-handing customers with no intention of conveying her ideas to her staff.   We asked a few more questions of the chef to see what she thought was what and my friend decided to play it safe and order off the regular menu, I stuck with the Pastrami special.

When the crepes arrived, fairly quickly, my friend's plate was overflowing with food while mine was very demurely folded into what looked like an empty crepe with some sparse decoration.   The pastrami was tasty but there wasn't much there, especially for $12 dollars. My friend said the Hawaiian wasn't bad but wasn't all that special.   Her crepe cost $14.  I wasn't that hungry that I needed a giant pile of food, but it makes them look bad that their portion sizes were so completely inconsistent, especially for the same table. 

Overall, if they hadn't been trying so hard to appear more than they were and just tried to be a consistent, decent crepe place, I'm pretty sure they'd warrant a return visit.   As it is, I'll spend my money someplace else.",2014-05-25 21:02:10

I remember a little bit about coming here as a kid. It was a time i had to wear those shoes with the fluffy socks. Now as an adult I was were socks with polka dots but you could see them under my boot. This is a fancy place, we talking jackets and dress. The also have a small valet outside if you're feeling like a VIP. We however self parked and walked through the revolving door. We checked in with the hostess and maybe waited 5 minutes. While be walked to the table they were being really courteous. Asking us questions like if we lived here and if we were celebrating anything. Of course we were just here to stuff our face. :) 
We sat down and already had an idea of what we were ordering. We went with the Diamond Jim Brady Cut. It's an extra thick portion. Me and my friend decided to split everything. They started with the salad. This was so fun to watch. It's a spinning bowl and they pour the dressing in and mix. After finishing the salad they brought the prime rib station over. They cut our piece and gave us an extra plate. They asked us how we wanted it cooked and we said medium well and we kinda got medium. We just ate it anyways, not a huge deal. The prime rib came with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding. The pudding is like bread and by itself is good but dipping in the juice and potatoes with some seasoning was very tasty. My favorite part of the whole entire meal was the seasoning pepper. I have a slight addiction to pepper and I was not disappointed with this all over my salad and even a little on my prime rib. We also order a side of scalloped potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus weren't cooked enough for me, but the scalloped potatoes were a mouthwatering side. With our dinners we had a ginger ale and a glass of wine. We order a mocato and it was the best I've had. We asked for the name again and the server wrote it down for us. She was so sweet. She explained everything to us and gave us the rundown on the menu too. We ended our meal with creme brulee. It was topped with fruit and probably the only good picture I took.

The place: Bare with the quintessential minimalist look. I can't say the vibe is warm and inviting because really, it's rather sterile - perhaps they want to discourage lingerers?

The goods: Not my favourite coffee. I found it bitter and unimpressive. I had high hopes but nope, it just didn't work for me. I had a Cortado and from what I tasted of the home made cashew milk, it had a nice flavour to it but the coffee roast just overpowered it. The croissant was fresh and pretty good.

Service: Slow as f**k. There was some hipster douche bag who obviously knew the girl behind the counter and he just kept going on and ON about useless, superficial shit because HEY - no one else is waiting in line!

I was promptly seated. I ordered the fresh garden rolls with shrimp and a bowl of Pho Ga.

The rolls were fresh, with lots of crisp herbs. The plate of aromatics for the Pho were also fresh looking.

The Pho itself - I tasted the broth without adding anything - I like to understand and experience the flavor baseline before adding anything - was a light, tasty chicken broth. I added the bean sprouts, lime wedge, jalapeÃ±os, and Basil. And proceeded to slurp my way through the bowl - applying prodigious quantities of Sriracha sauce to individual bites and to the broth.

The only thing I will ding the restaurant on - is there was a very loud child who apparently is part of the family of whomever runs Bowl of Pho. The child spent most of the time during my visit - very loudly running around the restaurant - making shrieking noises. It was rather loud and annoying.

I'm currently training in this neighborhood and don't have a car or the motivation to pack lunch everyday, so yesterday I decided to not judge a restaurant by its exterior and to invite myself in. I'm actually not a huge fan of pizza (crazy, I know), but saw ""falafels"" on the name banner and as a huge middle eastern food fanatic I knew I needed to at least see the menu. 

I was pretty impressed initially by the pricing although not everything is dirt cheap, especially the salads, which are around $8-12, which is comparable to salads sold in downtown Toronto. The pizzas looked interesting, and I can see them making them from scratch in the back with all the giant ovens. I ordered the small falafel platter $5.69, which came with a whole wheat pita, 3 deep fried falafels that they make on the spot, dipping sauce (tastes like tahini?), and a small aluminum container of side dishes, including hummus, baba gnoush, purple cabbage, marinated mushrooms, salsa, etc. Trust me, I eat a lot, and despite how small the portions looked, it was all very, very filling as you can expect from fiber and protein. Everything is supposed to be vegan, but who knows. There's also a large version of this priced at $8. Other non-pizza food options include salads, salmon platter, fries, soup of the day (made in-house, changes daily), etc. 

The staff members are very nice, and there always seems to be a steady flow of customers. Most of the customers are Jewish and look like regulars, so evidently Pizza Cafe has received the stamp of community approval, which truly says a lot about the food!

They also do catering.

ME8Ey6gPEBoZhSBF_SYljg,cBSYFg0yZ7ua5Fl_xcsfNQ,f8IMQgRwo-8GP372MElDGQ,3,4,2,3,"The hubs and I stayed here four years ago, back when we could still call ourselves tourists, and The Plaza was a straight up dump.  Twelve seasons and thirty five million dollars later it's more like a butter face girl with a mall department store cosmetic counter make over.  Sure it looks better, but you can still tell under all the frills it's might not be something you want.  There is a strange mix of old and new in here and you can point out right away what has been there for a while.  

I'll start with the old.  Thirty year old chandeliers stick out in a otherwise completely redone elevator vestibule.  Painted doors and hinges that stick in their frames next to poorly placed designer wallpaper.  Tiny bathtubs sit with shiny new faucets and tile.  Light switches and plates stained yellow from decades of smoke pop out from an almost completely renovated room.  There was a threadbare blanket tucked neatly between two new sheets instead of a comforter on the bed.  In the sports book you could walk between the new carpet of the casino that is a gray blend with red flowers to the old green carpet with shapes printed into it.  The buffet is now a sushi place, the layout is pretty much the same, but instead of the buffet line you have the sushi counter, but they kept the silverware.  Even the casino has mix of old barely working poker machines sitting pretty with shiny new reel games with fancy bonuses.  The worst of the old, the parking garage.  It looks like any day it could crumble to bits.

The new fabulous things are choices.  They have a sushi place, coffee joint, A Hash House a go go, a cupcake stop, Subway, a McDonalds opening soon and of course Oscar's steak house which will be arriving shortly.  There is an Italian place that is so poorly advertised that I can't be sure if it's open yet either.  Another thing that was missing those four years ago; ROOM SERVICE!!!  Yeah, it's probably not that great and is not twenty four hours but it's another choice.  They also house the only bingo joint in downtown.  Check in has moved from the second floor to a small spot right inside the domed area.  It kind of sucks having to walk from the garage all the way through the casino and then back to the tower with luggage in hand.  It would really accommodate someone who is being dropped of by taxi though.  The parking garage isn't in the best of shape, and being downtown, where you can walk anywhere you need to get to, one may not even need to rent a car if you choose to stay here.   

Overall the experience was a good one.  The rooms are still missing a few things like a remote, hair dryer, chairs for the desk and some decorative pillows.  I wish there was a extra pillows or a blanket for the bed as it did get cold overnight.  The room was basically clean and we got a great deal for the night at twenty eight dollars on expedia.com.  I have booked another stay for a friend and I as a girls' night out for a weekend rate of ninety five bucks so you can see there is a big swing in the rates.  I think the best deals are through their own website, but only if you are booking at least a two day stay.  With plenty of dining options and tons to do on Fremont street, the Plaza is a great anchor to spend your vacation checking out the cool side of town.",2012-01-04 21:57:36

I'm alright with Chinese buns, both sweet/savoury, and I do have my favourites.  However, for the most part, I just try not to eat them that much 'cause they're soo abundant and I get sick of them.  Plus, they're not conducive to staying trim!

Anyway, I was surprised about the prices.  Has it been this long since I've actually purchased Chinese buns?  Was I in some kinda time-warp?  As per my photo, Dan Tats (Chinese egg tarts) were $0.60/$0.70.  That's pretty cheap, considering the Portuguese version is like at least $1!  Other buns were ~$0.70/0.80 which is also quite good.

So far, I just tried the Coconut Tart and it was very good.  Fresh, moist, and not dry and overly sweet like a lot of places!

FK2LnOf1Nz3lYfFdAeUKiA,-ngKtxn2tB_c3fnNouRM5A,HP8mkVdLa9F4Amsp2thKhQ,4,0,0,1,"It is a very difficult thing, to stand on this part of the Queensway, where two well-known local chains almost but not quite face each other, and not immediately start to make comparisons between the two. Many of the other reviews do exactly that, and it may be a useful exercise for those who may have eaten one or the other before.

But I think that they are more or less two sides of the same coin -- neither of them is going to ever fully compare to the sweet memories of local burrito shops in my home area, San Francisco, the birthplace of these style of burritos. 

So, I'd like to judge this place on its own merits, and pretend that it is alone on the street.

Firstly, parking is a nightmare here. It shares a miniscule parking lot with a number of other busy businesses, and we opted to not bother, since I was in my behemothmobile. There's a shopping center parking lot a short walk away, and that made things a lot easier.

This is another style of burrito place where you pick your meats and fillings in advance, and then they toast the thing up on a hot grill before handing it out to you. This can create a little bit of a bottleneck as people wait in the ordering area for their orders. I grabbed a table while Lee waited for our food.

I like that they have a nice combo deal, where for slightly more than a price of a drink you get some chips and salsa thrown in. 

The dining area is pretty spacious for a place like this, and I really appreciated that. It's decorated with the numerous awards that the chain has won since opening. 

As for the burrito? It was great. I got a shrimp burrito with no rice and a lot of the extra spicy additions. It was mouth searingly delicious.

Went there on a Tuesday night, did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical Portuguese experience. 
One major downside: the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay. The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there. 
2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy.

The thing about this Shoeless Joe's, is that I want to love it, I really do... but I just... don't. 

Why do I want to love it? Well the staff are super-friendly, and the space is amazing! They have a sports-centre in the back of the bar area with reclining leather chairs and wall-to-wall screens. They have a few private dining areas which are really nice, and their booths all have private TVs. They have a great, convenient location, and have a really full menu that has something for everyone. 

So why don't I love it? Well I'm extremely partial to sliders, and upon my first visit there I was so happy to see that they have tons of slider options. The first time I ordered them, it was St. Patrick's Day, and it was insanely busy. They got my order wrong the first time, but quickly changed it. However, when I did get my sliders, they were cold! So disappointing, but I decided to give them another chance, since it was so busy that evening. Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders... unfortunately, they got my order wrong again... but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders. They were good, not great. The main issue I have with them is that they have a ""wonder-bread"" type bun. Just empty white-bread carbs that basically taste like nothing-ness - and if you're paying around $15 for sliders, I would hope to have something a bit better! I've been a few other times and have had salads (which are decent) and also they make an excellent Caesar, which have little pepperonis as a garnish! Their food on a whole though... is just okay. 

I really think it's the fact that I love the staff that will keep me going back... but they will probably keep disappointing me on the food-front!",2011-04-23 01:31:10

It was perfect.

The fajita special had just flashed by, so we waited...and waited...as the billboard s-l-o-w-l-y cranked through each page of the substantial menu.  At last, THAT page appeared, for just a second, but long enough to see that the special didn't have time constraints like ""served from 5:00 - 7:00 p.m.  Great!

I was really hyped up about trying Momocho since I absolutely adore Mexican cuisine. Unfortunately, I think my over-excitement may have hindered me from the start because I just wasn't that wow'd with the food. It was good, don't get me wrong. Maybe I was just expecting some sort of heavenly experience. I don't know. It could also be I just didn't order the right item, which is why I'd love to go back and try some other things. 

Let me start off by saying that for such a small space with a constant crowd, we were seated and taken care of miraculously well. I was not expecting that when I walked in and saw the cluster of people crammed into the bar area, waiting for a table. The owner was at the door, taking names and interacting with the customers. It was like a little celebrity moment since I had just seen him on the Food Network! (This visit was back in the early spring time.) Anyways, he told us about 30 minutes, so we ordered some beers at the bar. Within about 10 minutes, he had a table ready for us with a great server who was just specatular. 

We started with the traditional guacamole, which was very fresh and tasty. To me, it's a little difficult to mess up guac, especially since avocados are so delish just on their own. The chips were house-made, perfectly crunchy and rather addicting. We decided to try the dish that was featured on the Food Network and also a vegetarian taco thing with portobello mushrooms. The meat seemed a little overcooked and I couldn't quite make out all the flavors that were described so eloquently on TV. The portobello tacos were good, but I don't know if I was in the mood. 

I just wasn't blown away like I though I was going to be. Mexican food can be rather simple and still be ridiculously delicious. Momocho was definitely delicious, but I was hoping for more of a ""punch"" from the modern-side of it. There were a ton of other things on the menu that I want to try, especially after hearing many Clevelanders suggestions. I mean, if most of the city and America is raving about the food, I must have just missed something. I can't wait to go back and try some other fun menu options. Maybe I just need to step out of my comfort-zone. There definitely is no shortage of unique flavor combinations up Momocho's sleeve!

As for the food, their pork belly was great. They were thick cuts that had a lot of meat and not too much fat. Aside from that, the rest of their meat was decent. 

They have an interesting circular grill, which is different from most kbbq places. I never had to change the grill and it never burned the meat, which was convenient . After your meal, they offer you a complimentary cinnamon drink which is great and soothing. It's supposed to be good for you after eating oily meat the whole time.

They should probably hire at least one more person on the floor, because it looked like our server was trying really hard. Most other yelp reviews say the service here is bad, but for one person doing the whole job, I commend her.",2014-02-24 20:27:33

We were in line, but were number 5 on sunday. (The number one party was there an hour prior to opening.) We were able to leave, since our reservation was held, so our son got to play in the nearby climber, down the way. Hubby went over when the store was open. After some play time, we joined my husband who was there with the helpful and nice clerk. 

What did we need technical support for? We both had iPod issues. Mine was an older shuffle iPod and hubby's was a newly purchased iPod touch, wasn't holding a charge and kept dying, as the battery kept draining ever so quickly (still under warranty, until next June). The clerk tested them both. Mine can only play the existing play list (can't do anything new to it, because something in the software is messed up) and I can either use it until it dies or purchase a new one (I have two iPods, so I opted to play this one until it is dead). Hubby's was exchanged for a new one. This new one was also tested. Pretty cool.  

There was a children's play area with spheres and another clerk was helping them all get situated with using them (getting the spheres to move) in conjunction with tablets- that was pretty neat, there was an obstacle course on the table, outlined in blue tape. There was a dip at one point, which was challenging. One coworker commented that the clerk was having more fun than all the kids were! This is a neat way to keep the kiddos' attention while their mommies or daddies were getting technical support.

So, we were there, and I noticed that a local celeb (he has a show on the Strip) was there, but much like the last time, didn't appear to want any recognition. There were lots of people inside the store, but they didn't seem to notice him.

The reason I chose this bar was the fact that had live amateur boxing (and a real ring) set up in the parking lot area. The fights started about 2 hours late, but I watched about a dozen guys battle and one girl fight. Although everyone pre-registered it seems, just picture a woman sitting in the crowd drinking a beer with her crew and then they call her name to fight. Out she comes and this was amateur style at its finest as she took a whooping as did several other less skilled dudes who got knocked around from better prepared opponents (in the same weight class of course). There was an outdoor bar serving green beer ($4.50), a large wraparound indoor bar with varying degrees of crowds and at least two live bands played while I was in attendance. They did have a food menu, but their kitchen looked tiny and cramped and corned beef coming out did not have that wow factor. The crowds were pretty friendly, but the only negative occurred right after one of the fights in the ring when a real fight broke out in the crowd between those fighters friends or family. All you saw (from my side) was a huge bunch of people hurling punches (girls too) and the melee went on for a good 6 minutes. A total of five Mesa cop cars showed up and three were led out in cuffs.

They have a pretty extensive menu too, past just pizza's they have wings (that we'd like to try), entrees, and desserts. Other than just their regular slices, they have this one called a ""Stuffed Slice"" and seriously, one slice is enough for a family! Its stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, and bacon and its a meat lovers dream. 

My only downfall with this place is they clearly get a lot of delivery or pick up calls or something because when we go in, we definitely find ourselves waiting for a pretty decent amount of time before we get our food. Also, they're closed on Sundays, which is just ridiculous for a pizza place, but, it is what it is. If you're looking for New York style pizza, come here.",2015-09-24 13:53:59

Service is not what Superstore is known for. Low prices. But even then, you have to know your prices otherwise you may not save any money. What I hate is that you often have to buy 3 or 6 of something to get the lower price which is completely annoying as a single person. I don't need 6 cobs of corn. I only need 1 or 2. That's why I don't shop here much. Line ups can be horrendous if have more than what you can use in the self checkout line. And then you sometimes get the dumbass who has 50 items and takes his sweet time with it all. Those people should be banned from using these lanes. 

Produce can be hit or miss sometimes. I just don't think the drive is worth it for me personally. I refuse to buy meat or fish here because it just doesn't look right. And the bulk section sometimes scares me as I've seen people reach right in with their hands and start munching away. Geez! People have no manners. 

I have bought glasses at the optical place at one of the other locations. Price was good and it only took a week or so to have them made. In the summer I check out the bedding plants but again you need to buy 10 in order to get the lower price. Not worth it for the single chick here.

In fairness, I have only had their pizza on the two occasions that I visited, and am therefore unable to comment on their other menu offerings, which I should point out is a wide selection of appetizers, sandwiches and other Italian standards. 

For me the pizza just isn't anything to write home about. The crust is a bit thicker than I like (or recall from my yesteryears), and the flavor for me, isn't anything special. 

The atmosphere gives me a bit of a ""Kitchen Nightmare"" vibe. That's not in any way meant to infer that the kitchen itself is anything but, but the dated decor and the dark dining room just isn't all that inviting. 

The service was friendly enough. Not overly welcoming, but not off-putting either. All in all Santos, to me, comes off as an average, if not a bit tired, Italian Restaurant. 

With that said, I'll probably take another swing at it, and try some of their other dishes. I'll hold off on any further judgement until then. For now though, 3 stars seems fair. It's ""good enough.""",2018-07-17 15:42:32

Food - Great
Service - Bad

Arrived on a Monday night to a semi-filled restaurant. The waitress who brought us in gave us a table with a chair missing, even though there was a better table right behind. Gave us attitude when we asked to change tables. Anyways, decided to see past it and made our orders. 

After we ordered and finished 80% of our food did we notice that every other table had bread and we didn't. Asked the waitresses about it and only then did they ask if we wanted any, and made it sound like we had to pay for it. I don't know why they didn't bring us any when we ordered like every other restaurant, but the inattentiveness and the attitude they had when we asked for things just made our experience unpleasant. 

To their credit, all the dishes we ordered were very good, especially the oysters which is what they're known for. Price-wise it's on the expensive side, but for special occasions I don't mind shelling out a bit extra for some decent seafood. But their bad service really discourages me from going back. Didn't ask how the food was, no smiles, just seemed like they hated working there.

The difference in price is roughly +$2/lb at Diana's, or +$3/lb at a wild/organic store.

The difference in quality between the three is tremendous. Primarily, as you go up the price range, you get less fattier fish, and fish with more twitch muscles. At Diana's, you're sort of at the half way point.

The lunch buffet is split up into food varieties: Asian, American, Salad, Dessert, Italian, a Carving Station and one called Switch (this might be incorrect but it's something along those lines) this one switches out every other day of what is offered.

My favorites of the day were the Butternut Squash Risotto (and i tend to dislike risotto), The Kielbasa- I added the red cabbage to mine and the Bread Pudding (tasted like heaven in my mouth).  Oh and everyone must check out the rotating Gelato! 

I have decided I need to go back for both the Breakfast and Dinner buffets to find out which one is the ultimate best.


*Quick Tip: Get a total rewards card firs ton the 2nd floor and you will save $2 on the buffett.",2014-10-27 17:37:49

When ordering at Merry-Ann's, ""Occam's razor"" applies: go with the simple choices.  See a particular dish on the menu that you'd consider ordering?  First, imagine yourself cooking it at home...now count all of the potential steps where poor decision-making or lack of skill could result in disaster.  Choose the dish where there is little room for error and you're set.

On my first, misguided visit to Merry-Ann's, my youthful enthusiasm (and naivete) led me to order the Mexican omelet.  What was I expecting?  Maybe an egg-licious concoction with chorizo and peppers.  Instead I got something akin to a burrito with scoops of taco meat, where the thin skin of egg acted as a wrap.  I openly and unashamedly admit that I am a snob in this regard--due to early childhood trauma involving Taco Bell, I simply refuse to consume oily ground beef cooked with packets of ""Mexican-flavored"" seasonings.  The meal didn't make it far past ""Go"" before it had to take a few steps back...  Err.

With that experience behind me, I still gladly stop by Merry-Ann's, but now I stick with those simple dishes, like eggs, breakfast meat, and hash browns.  All the breakfast combination plates are pretty reasonably priced and the serving sizes are more than adequate.  I don't recommend the dinner items (remember Occam's razor?).

The overall ambiance of the place is above average.  Compared to campus-town's IHOP, Merry-Ann's is bright and clean.  The kitchen isn't in a separate room, which allows you to observe that a good deal of the food items are microwaved.  Maybe those people who have food industry experience wouldn't be surprised or bothered, but most places aren't quite so brazen about the nature of food preparation.

For standard breakfasts, Merry-Ann's is a solid choice, especially as it's the only real 24-hour game in town and within easy walking distance of all the downtown bars.  Still, I'd recommend keeping your expectations low.",2011-02-14 14:30:55

When we were there the staff was setting up for a very large birthday party that was supposed to be outside on the smoking patio. Then it started raining. Instead of displacing those of us in the bar, they were able to accommodate current customers and the large party in the dining room. The owner was right in the middle of the mix helping to move things around and get set up rather than barking orders. He seemed to create more of a family feel with the staff and customers, thus making everyone feel comfortable. 

We ordered the quesadilla and the calamari. The onion-ring-looking calamari has this very light breading that was just perfect. The quesadilla was huge and filled us up quickly. There is a red salsa-tasting sauce that comes with the calamari that was very good. The other sauce (not sure what it was) didn't compliment the calamari very well. Crystal suggested the chipoltle crema sauce, which went with both the calamari and the quesadilla. I have had the chips and salsa before and that's definitely worth trying as well. All the apps are 1/2 off during happy hour.

I honestly been coming here for years at their Pho never fails me. Being Vietnamese, I'm pretty picky about my Pho. (Although nothing beats California, this is my go-to place). I REFUSE to go to any other place for Pho, nothing beats the taste of their broth here. 

I order their Pho Chin Bo Vien all the time and switch it up with their Thai food. Although it's not actually Thai, there's a Vietnamese twist to it that I can't resist. I find it delicious but my mom doesn't think it's all great. Subjective I guess! They use Pho noodles for their Pad Thai and usually go onion + bean sprout heavy so ask for less if that bugs you. It's almost sour like from the paste (and probably all the lime I add to be honest) but I keep coming back for more! I just ordered a new dish I haven't tried but I'll update on that some other time. 
(UPDATE: Ordered the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle) and they didn't skimp on any ingredient, wow. Not as good as an official Thai cuisine restaurant but gets the craving settled!) 

Please try their Pho here. I can't stress it enough. My friends have tried Pho elsewhere and just had bad experiences and I really tell everyone to try it here. I actually always ask for to-go boxes to take home the broth to add rice to it or anything else as leftovers because it's that good. (It's not necessary to drink all the soup in your broth. It's not the norm but I can't get over how tasty it is!)

Came here to celebrate being veg-curious with some cool folks. I'd been to the Mekong Plaza across the street and tried UnPhogettable, which offers delicious pho. I was craving something hot to soothe my throat and pho sounded perfect. I'd read in reviews that this place has two menus: an American and a Vietnamese. Wanting to order something authentic, I chose from the latter and got a pho combo with beef and chicken. Since I thought the whole menu was vegetarian, I was excited to see this option with soy meat. I also ordered cream cheese wontons as an appetizer.

Our food came in waves in the order that we ordered. My wontons were pretty good and I liked the sweet and sour sauce. The pho bowl arrived and it looked surprisingly and suspiciously like it had real beef. Then when I noticed the bone marrow/gelatin, I knew something was wrong. Thankfully, Norm saved the day by tracking down our server and asking about it and somehow he gave me the real deal. It took 15 min or so for my vegetarian pho to come out and I didn't eat much of it. It was lacking flavor, even with the addition of Sriracha.

This is why I have trust issues. Apparently, the restaurant has two sides and one serves meat. Reading the name and the menu, I didn't realize this and only found out after my snafu. I can look past things like the ambiance if the food is good, but this wasn't the case. The placemats reminded me of the 90s and there was a dead fly on the table.

No one wants to stand in line when they go out to eat. They do advertise as cafeteria style but I feel like it's a huge disservice to their staff for tipping and their customers.

Anyways! My favorite udon place closed down.. Monson. Tear . And Sanuki has a similar menu. The food here is like a 6.5 out of 10 to me. Just at the right level to warrant eating out because you can't make it at home conveniently. 

They have a digital menu while you wait of mostly udon dishes and a couple of rice dishes. They also have some appetizers like their bao buns and their tempura station which is already made and a la carte. 

I love how they have a couple traditional Italian pasta dishes that they Japanese udon-ified like the carbonara and the seafood dish. The seafood dish had a decent amount of seafood for the price. I also really liked their curry bowl.

I had no idea the service style was like this and it's actually a lot of back and forth between the customer and the staff. Some things you order and take right away while other things get brought out to you or you go pick up.

They do have a wine list, and while it's small, it's also relatively cheap.  The bottles were all less than $30 each, and we got a nice shiraz to go with our dinner.

We started with the samosas, which were quite good, but standard, and then, in a flash of greatness, the words 'vegetable chat' caught my eye on the menu.

Vegetable chat is this thing that I love, that I've never known the name of.  It's a cold almost-salsa-like dish made up of chickpeas, potatoes, onions, and Indian seasonings, then topped with crunchy crackers (the same consistency and flavor of the samosa shell), yogurt, and tamarind sauce.  It's like a less-mayonnaise-d version of potato salad.  Oh, how I love it!  Star of India's was absolutely perfect, and I'm so glad I took a chance on ordering it.

However, not wanting to step totally out of my comfort zone, I ordered my typical mattar paneer.  It was good, and not a huge portion, so I didn't feel compelled to just keep eating and eating the deliciousness in front of me.

My husband got the tandoor mixed grill, which had chicken, shrimp, and lamb.  He was crazy about it.  Like most Indian restaurants, you can pick the level of spice for each entree.  The garlic naan was ridiculously puffy and buttery, which we loved.

We will definitely return to Star of India.  It's much more low-key than India Garden, but the food is just as good.  If you want a nice, laid-back place to have a bottle of wine and some tasty Indian food, check this restaurant out.  The only thing you'll have to worry about is parking, as it's metered street parking only, and this stretch of Craig Street can be busy, especially on the weekends.",2011-04-22 02:55:44

I first rushed into a Calamari Roll because I've never had one before. They had pieces of fried Calamari around the sushi. It was pretty tasty! I was practically full when I discovered the Red Bull Roll on the menu. It had fried shrimp and beef on it. I couldn't roll away from this Sushi Roll. I was mainly afraid that it wouldn't be here when I come back because of the constant menu changes. I made room and placed the order for ""The Red Bull"" . It had all the makings of what I would consider a great dinner...meat and fried shrimp! If I could just order this I would be satisfied .....it reminded me of a miniature shrimp and steak dinner.

Largest is around 400 gallons, smallest is about 130 gallons.  I go in there during late spring and summer and get fish.  Koi, goldfish and yes, mollies seem to do well in ponds as well.  I just wait until they have a sale on them, which usually means a great price.  I like taking one of my Great Danes in there since they allow leashed, vaccinated pets.  Stuff for my ponds is about all I get in there.  I don't buy much of anything for dogs because their prices are just too much more than prices I can find elsewhere.  But, it's a cool place to walk around and look at all the stuff and make a wishlist and maybe go on Ebay or visit Walmart (umm, well maybe not) or somewhere and see if you can find something at a bit more reasonale price.

We were just standing there looking at what we needed when finally an employee approached us. He was a very nice gentleman and he was so patient with us. He explained to us what exactly it was we needed and he answered all our questions.

They offer a few other desserts like macrons and Liege waffles other than their claim to fame. Macrons looked interesting and would be liked by kids for sure. The main attraction has so many flavors to offer that it took a bit of time to decide what to get. I had the bourbon and butterscotch. They do brulee' after the order so that's an attraction I suppose.  After the novelty of fresh brulee' wears off this place offers a mediocre take on this dessert. I think there was too much sugar on top and the base didn't impress much either. Maybe I ought to have tried the classic version first.

Concept is cool, service is good, fish is alright. Thank you to the staff for working under all the extreme pressures with a smile. I think the size of the restaurant is good. Now, onto the food. 

I came around 5:15ish and didn't get sat until 5:45 because they make sure your entire party is together before you're sat. There wasn't a wait. Most of the fish was fresh and decent. I didn't have much problems with this.

Salmon - It was good and had nice color. I didn't have any issues with temperature. 

Blue fin - YUMMM. This was my favorite and the best item! so good!

Toro - also another delicious item! YUM more please! That beautiful marbling... 

Sweet Shrimp - Good! Didn't have a weird taste and nice texture of the crunchy raw shrimp mmm.

Tobiko - Alright, this was good but I didn't realize the green one was wasabi. There has been green ones I've had that were other flavors. TOTALLY caught me off guard. My nose died. I mean I use a ton of wasabi to begin with. So add that on top ughhh.

Red Snapper - I enjoyed this too.

Short ribs - nice flavor and they included my favorite part, the bonessss attached.

Oysters - nice texture, fresh, and good. However, we had to ask 4 times for it because at this point it was getting kinda hectic for them.

Crab - I opted and tried the up charge of the crab. I regretted this. I don't recommend doing this. Both the flavors are visually the same. I had three ordered in total orders. It was super messy which is expected but yeah I kinda wished they pre-hammered it or something. The crab was dry and overcooked. The black bean flavor was a bit better than the salt and pepper one. I couldn't really taste anything on the salt and pepper one.  

So this is where the experience went bad. When they got busier in the night went later, we literally had zero sushi on the belt. By the time it got to us, we had nothing. Luckily I had some sushi to try already before I ate the crab but when I was working on the crab I didn't get any sushi. 

So I wasn't 100% full because we weren't getting anymore sushi. We settled to just grab dessert and go. PLEASE KEEP YOUR DESSERT! I feel as these would be a costly item and will go away eventually or run out. This was probably what I was excited for the most! They had the ice cream with the red bean sandwich and I was so happy they didn't run out!!! YEEE. Melon bars and some flavors of ice cream were available too! 

I'll probably give this another try when they have their grand opening. I sat on the inner left side of conveyor belt. I still got some sushi but i'm pretty sure much of the left side may not have gotten some sushi off the belt.

1) It's free.
2) The room is set up in an American style, even though they use Asian karaoke books.  That is, there is a stage with two microphones, and people sing facing the audience versus facing the TV.  They also have a disco ball and a smoke machine.
3) The song selection is not as good as Korea House - there are distinctly fewer recent songs.
4) They kicked us out at 9 pm on the Friday we went because they ""needed to set up the room for the next day.""

I am impressed with how nice the AGO is and how pretty the infinity mirror rooms are but I do have some feedback to hopefully help others that will be going to this exhibit after me, as you want to get the most out of your experience and I clearly did not. And you know how hard it was to get the tickets and you gotta line up like 6 times when you are there...

(1) You camera should be in normal mode, and not selfie mode. Because you are taking a picture of your reflection from the mirror in front of you. Some people in line were confused so I just want to put that out there so you get the most time in that room. Obviously you can take your picture any way you like.

(2) You will feel rushed. You get 20 sec for most rooms and 30 sec for the more popular ones like the souls of millions of light years away. And why do you get 30 sec for those ones? Because they force you to go in 3 people at a time...so be prepared to be in there with a stranger who probably only lined up a quarter of the time you lined up for because there's a single's line (see #3). 

(3) Single's line: if you came to this exhibit by yourself or you don't care if you go in with your friend or not, you can line up here and the line goes a lot faster, probably under 10 min, while the normal line is 20-30 min. However, this is where a lot of people in the normal line was complaining about. Everyone obviously lined up the long way just to get a picture with their loved ones or their friend...I know it's art and you are suppose to experience it, but let's be real, 90% of us want that perfect picture with the millions of lights!! But now you all of a sudden have a stranger in your photo. I know it's that way because you can take more people in a certain time slot, but I honestly am willing to pay more for more time in each room and to go in only with my friend. AGO, why not pair up the singles so they can go in with other singles instead of forcing them into other's people's groups?

(4) Wear comfortable shoes as you will be lining up 20-30 min for each room...meaning you will be there standing/ walking for at least 2 hours.

(5) Souls of Millions of Light Year's Away: the room darkens and dims for half the time you are there. So depending on your luck, you might only get like 10 send to snap a picture! There's also a line going down the middle of my face, which I didn't notice until afterwards. Beware of that line in the middle!!

The bacon cheese burger is a work of art.  The meat is substantial in portion and texture.  The toppings are hearty and fresh. The bacon is crispy to perfection. The cheese is amazing.

Killer fries.  And the portions are insane.  

The line ups move fast compared to holy chuck or burger priest, it is the perfect traditional burger (that you could actually eat everyday.... I nearly do),  and the fries are killer.  For these reasons I find this place to be better than its competitors. 

If they had milkshakes that would just make my head explode.  But I am not sure I could even finish a burger, fries, milkshakes combo.  That sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen.  But it is something I like about some of its competitors.

If i could give this place a ZERO STAR I would. And I see myself as a veey fair reviewer and rarely give a 1 star to restaurants. But this place just broke that record for the worst service and lack of organization. 

First of all, Good luck getting served here if you speak English and not Chinese or remotely look Chinese. We waited 20min for any server to give us service once we got  seated ... that's actually kind of ridiculous. My friend and I didn't speak Chinese we spoke English which got us less service as the waiting staff didn't want to give us eye contact. What are we? ALIENS or something? I thinking living in Canada you need to know English as a language no? We literally had to flag someone to give us some attention 2x before they actually took our order. 

Secondly, when my order came it was missing parts to it (I.e. the sauce bowl that came with the plate was empty) took us another 10 minutes to flag someone to let them know they gave me an empty sauce bowl. The waitress took it to the back kitchen and then came back with my meal 5 minutes later. Once my meal was plopped in front of me, I then begin to notice a HUUUUGE LONG piece of pewbby hair on my rice (notice on the photo I am attaching with this review). I was so disappointed and now disgusted with my order I don't even know how we continued to wait here and eat. My friend was hungry so we toughed this one out and stayed. Finally all our orders came but after a long wait. I felt that after I complained about the long disgusting piece of hair in my meal, all they did was pick it out with their finger and plopped it back on my table. GROSS!!!! 

I didn't eat my rice at this point. By the time we finished our meal we realized they didn't even serve us our soup which came with our meal. This is literally an hour later they didn't even think to check if they got our order right or wrong. Here I am frustrated with this nasty place. Service is horrible and kitchen is possibly dirty. 

Please do not go here unless you want to be ignored and not get any service at all. I'm a very fair reviewer but when your restaurant gives bad service to paying customers, I think someone has to speak up and say something otherwise restaurants that are run badly will continue to run badly because they don't know. I won't be coming here again. I'll be going back to my favorite one which is NEW CITY located literally beside blue ocean restaurant. 

This place gets a ZERO star from me if it was even possible. Fix your customer service weather you are a small restaurant or a large restaurant. Otherwise you will get bad reviews for treating your customers badly. 

Dining should always be a good experience especially if your a paying customer to eat at such a place.",2016-08-04 20:57:24

Go early enough to avoid parking hassles and bail by noon before it gets too hot and you'll have wallked
enough to work up an appetite for lunch...ALOHA!!!

The food above seemed decently healthy.

The coconut juice from the coconut they opened was rather bland too.  I remember going to Hawaii and drinking the juice from the fresh coconuts there and that was an awesome experience.  The coconut juice here tasted like crap.",2015-06-09 16:13:36

I typically visited Tryst for brunch on the weekends. They make a mean spicy Bloody Mary complete with bacon slices and a cube or two of white cheese, along with the traditional olives, celery, lemon and lime. Whoever said they got an ungarnished Bloody Mary must have just been there on an off day?

For lunch or dinner, the ahi salad is really tasty, and a pretty good value at $13. They don't skimp on the portion of ahi. They used to have this amazing turkey burger on a pretzel bun with Brie and some kind of strawberry or raspberry jelly, but I don't think it's on the menu anymore. The Kahlua pork sandwich is yummy too. 

I brought my mom here for lunch one time when she was in town visiting me and she loved it. She's really big on anything organic or locally sourced, and Tryst is both. 

Hopefully I'll have an excuse to venture up north sometime soon and I can indulge again.",2012-10-10 04:00:12

One of the cheaper Thai places. Most dishes run around $7-8 and the portions are great!! Almost enough to share but it's so good you won't want to. If you can't handle spicy food, be careful when ordering (scale of 1-10 spice).

Soju is $16/bottle - we didn't have any, but GOTDAMN!
Soondubu is $13.99 - Hello Mr. Tofu for $8! 

Obviously this place is on the Strip, at the Quad, blah blah, but I find these prices ridic!

Anyway, onto the food:
There's no kids menu, so Hunnie Bunnie just had the Pho Tai ($10.99): This is actually great becauae she loves pho. The bowl was big and the flavor was GOOD. It comes garnished with sliced onions and green onions and a side of lime, cilantro, fresh jalapeÃ±os and bean sprouts.
Friend and I shared Spicy Squid with Vegetables ($21.99) and Spicy Pork Soondubu ($13.99):
The stir fried squid was extra spicy which was totally awesome and they didn't seem TOO skimpy on the squid but there were TONS of veggies, including kimchi, onions, green onions, bell peppers and jalapeÃ±os in the mix. 
The Soondubu came SKIMPY with BEEF! Yeah we ordered Pork but this is what we got. Ugh! It came with lots of broken up tofu which I HATE. I prefer larger clumps in my soup! The soup flavor was just aiight too! 

Service was pretty MEH too.

J2EXXjzbKKUOtzUqTi9blA,m5b84-nPPVNLlDtZyVGZ3w,mFBZcwkHuys0pbyBGOhKoQ,4,4,5,5,"My experience with Flock is a tale of customer service.  I work in the restaurant industry, and one time we had a woman complain to us (for non-valid reasons).  We sent her a gift card to make it up to her, and she wrote us an email saying when she complains to a business she wants two things: for the to acknowledge her complaint and listen to her, and for them to do something to try to make it up to her.  I agree with that idea, and Flock came through in a big way.

If I had a normal experience with Flock, I'd give it three stars.  It definitely adds value to the neighbourhood, and fills an empty niche -- lunch spot with healthy, fresh meals.  It closes at 8 pm, so this won't be your dinner spot unless it's a pick up on your way home from work.  The first time we tried it, it was just a few days after opening.  We ordered for pick up - phoned in at 7:50 pm and the woman answering the phone said they closed at 8.  We ordered two custom salads.  Went to pick it up, there was total chaos and disorganization in there (sort of understandable, it had just opened).  When we got home (which is less than 3 minutes away), our salads were completely wrong -- wrong dressing, missing ingredients (which we had paid extra for, like avocado and egg), and just overall a disappointment.  I was missing some of the best parts of the salad!  Since the place was now (we figured) closed for the day, we decided to just write in about our experience the following day.

We wrote to the restaurant and Cory (the owner, and chef from Harbord Room/THR) wrote us back write away (personally!).  He said to let him know the next time we were coming in, and he'd make it right.  Very good response, the right kind, and so fast.  We took him up on his offer yesterday, when we wrote in and said we'd be stopping by for take out again -- he said they would make us a bunch of stuff (chef's choice, I guess!).  This ended up including a whole chicken, two of their salad creations, and their two sides on offer.

My thoughts on the food (which is skewed because totally free and therefore more awesome): the salads were really good.  My eating companion doesn't eat delicious things, so he had them omit some stuff that would have made these salads even better, but they were good.  The chicken was good, although not any better than those pre-cooked whole chickens you buy at the grocery store, but it's nice to have already hot, cooked chicken waiting for you.  I liked the sweet potato side, it had a good kick to it, but the acorn squash was weird as heck.  The kind of weird where I kept going back to it being like, ""This is so weird...."" but not something I'd order on my own.

So in conclusion: customer service A+. Addition to the neighbourhood: A+.  Will go back, and try other things, because they secured me as a repeat customer!",2015-07-17 16:27:01

Service - 1/5. Awful.

I've been here on three separate occasions. Each time I've come back hoping that my experience will get better, but unfortunately, this has not been the case. Let me start off by saying that the food here is grand. Probably one of the best Korean places in this part of town, and with decent sushi (of varying quality depending on what day you come/who's making it). The first time sushi was delicious and excellent, the second and third times, the rolls were sloppy and way too big and they just didn't taste that great. 

The place inside is really nice-looking and they have a nice way of giving you a complimentary steamed egg with your meal. How nice! The caveat to such great food and nice interior, though, is the ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE I've received every time I've come to Gogi. The servers are totally negligent. It is so hard to flag them down, they won't refill your water, they never ask you if you need anything or check up on you, they will blatantly busy themselves doing other stuff instead of stopping by your table once, even if the restaurant is empty. It took me FOREVER to get through dining here because of the servers. First it takes them forever to come around for your drink order. Then they'll leave and 20 minutes will pass before they ask you for your food order. They'll never refill or ask you if everything's okay (had to wait for almost an hour to ask for an appetizer, during which we changed our minds). Needed extra sauce or something with our food when it came... never came. Took forever to come and give us a check, longer still to come back and get the check. TOOK ALMOST THIRTY MINUTES TO RETURN OUR CARDS TO US EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT. 

So I've come to hate this place because of the slow and negligent service I've experienced each time I've come here. I've never felt more ignored (sometimes blantantly, I'll make eye contact with a server and try to flag them down and they'll walk away) as a customer. If you really want great food and can stomach being treated poorly, I'll still say the food (not the sushi) is great. If not, however, take your patronage elsewhere.",2015-01-19 19:58:55

That puts it in a different category than a quiet dinner for two, and also in a different category than a group event. When a large number of casual friends get together it puts an extra challenge on the restaurant, as people will be arriving and leaving at different times; people want separate checks; and there is no planned menu to work with. I'm taking all of that into account.

As would be expected, some people were already there and eating when the bulk of the group arrived at 6 PM.  And also, predictably, a few people arrived after most people were already finished eating. The server handled the challenge without flinching. He did most of the work himself, with the assistance of a helper who appeared to be a trainee. As far as I know, no one's order got messed up and the food was on the table within a reasonable time after ordering. The only glitch I saw was that one guest was served her soup ""uncomfortably"" earlier than the rest of the meal was served to the other guests. The server could have timed that a little better. Impressively, the server handed out separate checks almost flawlessly to couples and singles without asking and making a big point of it. He seemed to have a second sense about whose check went to whom.

Overall the service was efficient and moderately friendly. Once again it's the old story of you get treated how you treat other people, and our group is pretty laid back and friendly. Los Olivos isn't bubbling over with effusive charm but it's not rude or unfriendly either.

The ambience is, um, dated. The room is well-worn, with broken window coverings, and an overall look that the management isn't putting much attention into maintaining the building. You know you have a problem when your guests notice such things.

The prices are on the high side for what is being served. On one hand that is to be expected, being in Scottsdale and being a haunt for the winter tourists. That fact was very evident on a mid-June hot summer Saturday night that a Mexican restaurant (in Scottsdale) was virtually deserted. The early dinner crowd cleared out about 7:30 and after that I did not see any more seatings, just a lot of empty tables.

And the #1 reason people dine out ... the food itself?  Neither terrible nor wonderful, just very average. My selection was remarkably bland and uninteresting, although some of the other platters looked a bit better. Put Los Olivos down as an okay place to have dinner with some friends and have a couple of drinks, not as a place to go for a good Mexican meal.

What saved Los Olivos from a mediocre and average 3-stars is the way they handled what is probably the most challenging situation a restaurant can face ... a large casual gathering of friends. It's a challenge so many restaurants utterly fail at and this place did surprisingly well.",2015-06-21 07:21:14

Service was great (as should be expected at such an establishment). Our server also made suggestions for food and drinks. I went with the  ""Breakfast Americaine"" (Two eggs any syle served with bacon, country sausage, pommes frites & toasted brioche) and a mimosa.  As far as what I selected for brunch, i was not too impressed. I understand that my selection of brunch cuisine was a bit generic, but the price versus the quality was not what I had expected. Eggs were done well, bacon was crispy, country sausage was not as appettizing, but the frites & brioche was pretty good. I will say that i have has better frites. 

Atmosphere is great. I have to been to upscale establishments where it can feel a bit stale. At brunch, the atmosphere is much more upbeat and without the snobbery. Also, layout is well done with indoor and outdoor seating.

I have never had a long wait for anything I have ordered. As for snacks, they do have baklava, which is an unusual choice, albeit delicious!

The curtain would not close completely so there was a strip of sunlight that woke us up each morning. And housekeeping missed our room. No clean towels, beds were not made, trash was not emptied. They simply didn't do it. Disappointing because when we came back to the room later that night after the wedding with friends and relatives, we were surprised to see it had not been touched. Embarrassing.  The next day when we checked out we told the front desk and they barely squeaked out an apology. It's as if they didn't care. So, I guess we stay elsewhere next time.

They center it is in is a bit dodgy.  NW corner of Dobson and Guadalupe.  It's next to the Pawn Shop.

Upon entering the decor is absent.  It's really just a small podium and several blank walls.  What did I get myself into?  But from the podium they led us down a nondescript hall into the dining area.  The decor here was still a bit lacking, but better.  ""Romantic lighting"", several small tables...starting to feel like a bistro!  When we arrived there was quiet live music.  I should comment that the music was really nice.  Not at all Italian, but I liked that the musician wasn't blaring.  It was nice background music that allowed people to have a conversation without yelling.

We were seated at one of a small number of tables.  (Reservations might be a good idea...most of the evening I didn't see more than 1 or 2 empty tables, so I can see them being packed sometimes.)  They have an extensive menu.  Almost too much.  How can a small bistro kitchen cope with so many different dishes and maintain quality?  After looking at sandwiches and pizzas and different chicken dishes and veal dishes I settled on the bolognese.  Properly done this should not be ""spaghetti and meat sauce"".  My wife ordered chicken toscana.  We also got the calamari appetizer.

The calamari was good.  Simple, but good.  Not rubbery at all, nice light crunch of the breading.  Done well.  At the same time they brought out ""house bread"".  They make it themselves.  It's really good.  As good as any bakery.

The entrees came with a house salad.  My wife liked it.  I don't do salads, and they would not substitute for a soup.  I could order a soup, but no substitution.  Annoying.

My bolognese was really good.  Perfect, really.  Portion maybe a bit small, but the pasta was done properly and the bolognese sauce was dead-on.  Very flavorful.  My wife loved her toscana.  I didn't particularly (it was 'ok'), but she was very happy with her choice.  I mean really happy with it!

The bistro is owned by a middle-aged couple.  It's not a chain.  The chef has worked there since before this couple owned it, or so they told me.  I think as long as that chef is there we have a new favorite Italian place.  Yes, they are more expensive than the Olive Garden.  But they are so worth it if you love Italian food.

Each sushi roll and every bit of nigiri is prepared with care and made to look beautiful.  The prices are standard for sushi, and not too expensive, though of course not something you can get every day in good conscience.  

The service is good.  I've eaten several times at different times in the day, and the waitresses are always polite and prompt.  They're a little subdued in early afternoon, but they're quite nice at dinner times.

The atmosphere varies, but not at all badly.  In the lunch times and early evenings, when there isn't as many people, they're a quiet, pretty restaurant that you'd take someone for a chat while you eat, whereas when you are at dinner, especially on a Friday or Saturday, they're full and very noisy.  Why noisy?  Because the sushi chefs are busy being fun and crazy and flirty (with women) and sometimes randomly offer free drinks and shots of things, and if not, then they're being bought drinks by the appreciative customers.  But the service is always good.

The quality of the fish has never let me down.  Even on Sunday nights, when most sushi places are at the other end of freshness, I Love Sushi seems to chug along as usual, and some of the dishes just can't be matched anywhere.  

I always eat Dynamite at sushi places, and theirs was quite good, if not the best in the entire world.  I'd say it'd be great to order if you're there, but not worth a special trip.

Overall, I love coming here when I have extra cash on hand.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have an all-you-can-eat option, which I suppose would make the service level fall, the quality diminish, and the presentation falter.  But I eat a lot of sushi :/",2008-05-09 03:04:44

I visited here for the first time this weekend and was a bit surprised as to why this is one of the go-to places for pho. It isn't bad, but isn't the greatest. They do, however, provide plenty of noodles and beef in your bowl. 

Now, about their bowl, it's not your typical large bowl opening, but their small bowl is pretty narrow and, you know when you add all the basil in your food but you don't eat basil?, you have a hard time actually getting noodle without the basil because of the tiny circumference.

I was also irritated by the fact that when I ordered a small iced coffee with milk, they didn't give me a plate to place the filter when i had to take it off the mug and pour the coffee into the glass of ice. Needless to say, the area in front of me became a caffeinated mess.

All of this sort of points to the overall experience of the restaurant. It's not so bad that you'd vow never to come back, but there's just something askew.

A few notes:
- by default their noodles are wider than normal pho noodles, if you want normal size noodles, you have to ask for ""thin noodles""
- they do serve cold tea now...according to Vivek S. in one of the June 2011 reviews, it wasnt available, but when I went this weekend, it now is.",2011-09-27 01:22:45

It's a nice looking restaurant/bar. I sat at the bar so I don't know what the rest of the place looks like. The service here was really good. I didn't have a single problem. 

First night I ordered the bacon and cheddar burger with a pretzel bun. I was skeptical of the bun thinking it was some sort of gimmick, but it was really good! The burger, I ordered it medium rare, came out rare, but I'd rather go that way than the other. The only big problem with this burger is that the onion rings I ordered to go on top of it were red onions. Red onions are not sweet, they are very bland and in turn really bring the taste of the burger way down. I like the sweetness of white/yellow onions. These were not that. I couldn't even eat them, they were gross. 

The second night I was there I ordered the same thing because it really was a great burger. I asked this time if they could make my burger actually medium rare since it was so rare last time. The bartender recommended I order it medium and then it would come out medium rare (you'd think), but it actually came out medium. Uh. They brought me my new burger out and it was fine, but I was irked by the insistence of the person who brought it to immediately cut into it (which I don't, I eat it as a whole burger) to see if it was okay. That was not okay, the burger was. 

I then ordered a dessert that I waffled on. I really wanted the pop tart but then waiter told me it was really small. I then ordered my other choice, the red velvet birthday cake. They should REALLY have a disclaimer that their cake is NOT made in-house. If I want boxed cake I don't need to pay $6 a slice, I can walk to the grocery store and get a whole cake for that. I don't go to restaurants to have boxed dessert, I just don't. This and the onion rings were why it gets this many stars. 

The service is excellent, the bartender that waited on me both times was very nice and the food could be great with a few modifications. I won't be back, but it was an okay place to have dinner a couple of times.",2016-01-30 23:27:38

I arrived by myself around 7:00pm and had no trouble getting a seat.  I chose to sit at the pizza bar, even though I wasn't planning on getting the pizza.

Zenia was my waitress and she did a great job.  I came for the cacio e pepe, but she talked up the meatballs enough to pique my interest.  She was willing to give me a smaller version of the meatball starter (essentially a side of two meatballs in sauce).  She asked if it was okay if they were plated together and I requested that they be plated separately.  I was brought some bread and olive oil to nosh on while waiting for my meal.  The bread wasn't remarkable, but it did a find job of sopping up some of my leftover tomato sauce.

My food arrived extremely quickly and it looked beautiful.  The pasta was terrific.  The noodles were nicely al dente and that familiar black pepper taste was prominent.  I ate it all.  The meatballs were good, but didn't wow me.  Which is fine, because I'll eat that pasta all day.

One of the most enjoyable parts of my dinner was being able to chat with the folks on the other side of the pizza bar making salads and pizzas.  They were extremely friendly and happy to answer any questions that I had about their pizza oven and how they make their pizzas.

The next time I'm in town, I will happily make time to venture up the Mirage to chow down on the cacio e pepe at Osteria Costa.  And I'll try the pizza.",2018-03-04 02:14:34

Makes you feel not so bad about drinking beer. We kept asking for the bill, we'd pay, and then order one more pitcher. It became an ongoing joke with our server. She just kept assuming we'd take another. 

Service here was awesome! That being said, we were one of many 5 tables, and we were our server's only table...so she was very attentive to us. We did ask her if it does ever get busy here, because they do appear to have a lot of seating, to which she said that some nights it's standing room only.

Thank you so much Bobby and Zeneta for taking such wonderful care of our fur children, Mochi & Bailey. Simply amazed at the energy, professionalism and genuine care of all the pets you take in. If I could give them a bazillion stars, I would. 

My dogs are my family. Both are rescues and are like kids to me. Mochi specifically was a therapy dog for me when I suffered from an arrhythmia; she was also my big sister Evelyn's therapy dog when she suffered from cancer and was also there when my sis took her last breath at the hospice. So needless to say, Mochi and Bailey rescued us and mean the absolute world to me and my family. I do not leave them with just ANYONE, especially since we've had horrible experiences at other pet boarding places.

The minute the co-habby called and spoke with Bobby, we were immediately reassured that we chose the right place! Bailey is special needs and Mochi has some personality issues when it comes to larger dogs and Bobby understood our requests completely. Upon dropping them off, we were greeted by his gorgeous wife Zeneta. As soon as you walk into the lobby, the smell is just so fresh and clean you would have no idea that you were at a pet hotel. And the high roller suites are ridiculously cool!!! Chewy Vuitton room anyone?? I almost wanted to stay there myself, lol. Each room has a flat screen TV which blew my mind. 

Zeneta was confident about dogs and their interaction with one another and made sure by taking us over to outdoor doggie play area. And like she said, they both did great! Someone is always there watching the dogs so no rough housing will occur. We left to go to the Elara and felt immediately happy that we chose Luxe Pet Hotels. They even sent us text photos of our dogs playing and gave us status updates. LOVE THAT!

Upon picking them up, we met Bobby who was kind in person as he was on the phone. Zeneta even took the time to feed our dogs and smash up Bailey's food because she has no teeth like the senior citizen dog she is, lol. I will absolutely not hesitate to take them back here because Mochi, who is super picky, behaved like she didn't want to leave!!! Which NEVER happens!! 

We can't wait to bring them back here when we return for my birthday in the summer. Thanks a million Bobby, Zeneta and staff for truly caring about our pets and making sure they had a blast!",2016-02-24 19:58:25

I love that it was an old manor turned into a facility that students can use. Gym, study areas and Sammy's this place is very versatile. It is very quiet and the best part is the ambience here. It is Hogwarts at UofT. (From time to time you see the Quidditch club running around which makes you feel like you're living in the wizarding world!) Only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is that it is quite old and the ventilation, especially in the washroom, is horrible!

We arrived around 11 and were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. The wait ended up being just shy of 30 minutes. The waiting area is very comfortable with seating and newspapers to read. The restaurant also puts out a plate of mini muffins to enjoy as you wait. When it was time to be seated the hostess offered to take our bags. We were given claim tickets to retrieve our bags after brunch.

Our waitress greeted us soon after being seated. She quickly brought drinks and told us about the specials for the day. She was friendly and checked on us frequently. The atmosphere for brunch was very lively. Tables were fairly close together so it was a bit on the noisy side. 

I ordered one of the specials which was a French onion base with flat iron steak and spinach topped with two eggs. It was a unique dish to be offered at brunch that was very well prepared. The French onion base was delicious and worked well with the steak and eggs. There could have been more steak, but other than that the dish was great. The toast on the side was a good way to enjoy the delicious mixed berry jam.

My husband had the BLT Tartine served with Pommes Frites. The BLT was loaded with crispy bacon. It was challenging to cut and enjoy, but my husband enjoyed the flavors. The Pommes Frites were perfectly prepared and addictive. 

We were offered a dessert menu which of course I welcomed. Why don't all restaurants offer breakfast dessert!? The Meringue with fresh fruit was perfect for the two of us to split. The meringue was large with a crunchy outside and soft center. It was perfectly sweet. The fresh fruit was a nice balance to the sugary meringue. 

Be aware that they do not take reservations for brunch which is fine. I only note this because the woman at the front desk during our check-in at The Venetian told us we would need a reservation for brunch. When reservations were unavailable I initially assumed they were booked and almost went to plan B. A call to the concierge cleared this up. I'm not knocking any stars since that misinformation wasn't from the restaurant. I was told that they take reservations for dinner and they are recommended.",2016-07-04 04:19:19

We were a group of five and since there was an hour wait for a table, we opted to sit at the bar.  

Food:
I didn't have time to peruse the menu since I was too busy chatting, so I chose the first thing that caught my eye - the New Wave Pad Thai ($13.99).  The other gals ordered the Korean Sizzling Salmon ($14.99), Thai Mussel Bowl ($11.99), Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll ($9.99), and the same Pad Thai dish. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portion of my New Wave Pad Thai; it was enough to feed at least two as a full meal.  There were plenty of chicken breast chunks and shrimp.  The sauce was a bit on the tart side, and although not a groundbreaking dish, I enjoyed the flavor. (See pics.)

The portions for the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and Thai Mussel Bowl were also generous.  I tried a piece of the sushi roll and was not impressed; the ""tempura"" was too crunchy, probably a result of being over-fried.  

Drinks:
Four of us tried the Forbidden Dragon (looks like a Mojito / $7.99) and the other tried the Frozen Thai Mai (not Mai Thai, mind you / $7.99).  The Forbidden Dragon consisted of pineapple rum, mint, lime juice, pineapple juice, and was served with a floater (shot) of absinthe.  My drink wasn't strong enough for my taste, but still, I liked the flavor - had a hint of licorice (from the absinthe). 

Pros:
- quick and attentive service by bar staff
- generous food portions at reasonable prices
- interesting menu with lots of choices
- located downstairs from Airia Nightclub 

Cons:
- lack of ambiance (too bright and smoke/noise from the casino floor filtered in through the open spaces where windows should have been)

I ordered a Tempura Udon and a volcano Maki sushi. 
My friend ordered a Kyoto Box and shared their green tea mochi amongst the 3 of us.
My other friend ordered 2 sushi dishes that came with rice. All our meals came with miso soup and sweet ginger dressing salad. A waitress stopped by and offered me some spice powder for my Udon, I really enjoyed it, not overwhelmingly hot at all, great flavor. 

The quality of the food is like it's been handled with care, buffets don't have that quality and it was a lovely experience. I took home most of my udon though XD.

I usually go to my regular joints on Spring Mountain but this time I wanted to try something different so I stopped by Pho Little Saigon before heading out on the road back to LA. Give it a shot, why not?

I agree with some of the reviewers, lack of staff. The place isn't THAT big but if it gets busy then what? My experience with pho places are that if they're really good, then the staff is plentiful and the food comes out faster than McDonald's because they want you in/out of their place so they can make room for the next customers. 

My pho was decent. There was plenty of meat and noodles so they weren't tight on that for sure. You don't get your own plate of veggies though. Three people in my party ordered pho and we only received one plate of the bean sprouts, lemon, & basil leaves. Most pho restaurants will give you one plate per pho bowl, not here. The spring roll was mediocre, actually don't even bother. No extra veggies for you there either.

Next time, I'll probably play it safe and return to my other usual pho restaurants.

Greens and veggies were fresh and crisp. I didn't even really need the dressing. Sat in a comfy booth. The waitress was on top of everything.  Lots of TV screens with the Pirates game on. What a relaxing but productive time. My colleague had their burget and fries and seemed to enjoy it.

Followed by another 'dinner' with another couple of coworkers who arrived later and I met them since they wanted to get through some work to prepare for our meeting the next day. Waiter was funny and the vibe was good. We left right before the second rush (post game crowd) came in.

Living in Chicago, I am pretty particular about steakhouses but I was cautiously optimistic.  The restaurant is very upscale and seems out of place next to the somewhat rundown Holiday Inn.

My son and I were seated in the bar area.  We had a pleasant server and our service was generally good.  Even though this is a steakhouse, we both ordered seafood.  Maybe this was a mistake.  My son had the sauteed shrimp and scallops and the scallops were overcooked.  I had the Chilean sea bass.  It was also overcooked, and it didn't quite have the proper texture of this type of fish.  This I attributed to being well-done but when our bill arrived, the fish that was listed on the bill was halibut.  Hmmm.  In retrospect, the fish tasted somewhat halibut-like and when I questioned the waitress about this, she investigated and returned to tell me that the bill was a mistake, it really was sea bass.  I'm not so sure about that and my Yelp rating reflects that.

Anyhow, the highlight of the meal was my glass of Cameron Hughes 2009 Lot #279 Cabernet Sauvignon.  Delicious.  I will have to find that bottle somewhere.",2013-08-05 04:12:35

Granted, all the ones I've been to have been on the East Coast, so this might be great for Madison/Wisconsin. I got my usual mango lassi to accompany my meal, and it came with whipped cream and maraschino cherries and what seemed to be grenadine. Why would you do that? Not only does the mango not taste like real mango, the lassi came out way sweeter than any I've had and probably sweeter than any proper lassi you'd find in India. In a similar vein, the food was OK, but it was missing the potency so signature of Indian spice, that fragrance that's supposed to envelop you when at Indian restaurants. Where is the meaty grilledness in the tandoori chicken? Where is that earthy cumin in your samosa? Everything just tasted kind of...impotent. I can't tell if it's because they're trying to pander to Midwestern tastes or if they're skimping on the spices for business reasons, but I left the place without the taste of pungency that I was really hoping to load up on when I go to Indian buffets.

PS - After reading a few reviews from some Indian customers that also mentioned that they could improve their flavor, I feel like less of a crazy person. It seems that they're spiced just OK for Midwestern palates but could be missing something if you're looking for really traditional Indian food.",2015-12-21 08:42:35

But recently I decided to try microdermo and did some research. Not only was Fuchsia's price one of the most reasonable in town, they used the diamond system, so I decided to return.

First visit - HEAVY sell on the membership even before my treatment, which I understand and expect but it gets really old. My treatment goes well, although I am a little upset they do zero extractions during a microdermo facial, apparently. Heavy sell again on the membership again when I checkout. I opt to buy a special 3 treatments for $150 card. 15 minutes later I get a phone call asking if I can return to the store. They apparently gave me the wrong card. I tell them I am already two far away. I was slightly shocked they would ask me to return to correct their mistake. Oh well. 

Second visit - The air conditioner is not working. IN JULY. It's not horrible, but it is unpleasant enough that they opt to keep the door open while I get my treatment, which I find slightly strange and not very relaxing. I wish they had called me and asked to re-schedule. When I check out this time I receive the big sell on products. Again, I expect this, but it's still annoying. The products I am shown are very expensive ($65 mask, for example) and I politely decline. No samples are offered. I leave feeling and looking like I have a sunburn and still look that way the next day. I figure it must be working and this is normal. 

Third visit - Explain the sunburn feeling from the second visit and am told this is normal because they have ""gone up"" on my microdermo handle/wand/tool thing. At checkout another sell on the membership because now I am out of treatments on the card I had purchased. I tell them I will think about. I then got a sell on product, but this time they offered samples. I happily take my product sample and the membership brochure and am on my merry way. However, now I am worried that my treatment was either bad the 1st and 3rd time, or bad the 2nd time, because I do not feel or look sunburned. So which time(s) did I get ripped off?

The front office ladies (possibly also the owners?) are very friendly and nice and seem to know members names, etc. However, they are always a bit disorganized (making appointments over the phone is always a little taxing) and heavy on sell of memberships, extra treatments, products, sparkly things they sell in the store. And frankly, I don't blame them. They want to make money! 

Bottom line - I don't think my treatments were consistent and they are too far away from me, so I am not sure I will return. If you are interested in a membership (at least 12 months) and you find a good person there who you can trust, it's probably a great deal. I, however, will probably continue my search.",2009-08-04 22:32:44

It is not much to look at, it is basically just a simple house, and I would have actually missed it if not for the Mexican flag flying overhead.  At closer look I saw it was actually a Mexican restaurant.

One of the best qualities of a Mexican restaurant is that they actually employ Mexican staff, I was able to converse with the waiters here in Spanish and they both assured me that the chef was indeed from Mexico and that the food was as authentic as it can get.

The interior is not too fussy it is rather simple and this is good because sometimes the overtly overdone bad Mexican interiors that I see Calgary having can convince people that indeed it is a Mexican restaurant.  More often than not, it usually is a bad version and even worse Tex Mex food.  Here at Los Chilitos there are no apologies nor any interior hype because thankfully the food basically speaks for itself.

The lunch menu is a nice simple selection of Enchiladas, Gorditas, Sopas and Tacitos.  The food is garnished well; the portions are generous and are all under $12.  Which is expensive compared to eating in Mexico but it is cheap for Calgary and you are getting the real enchilada so to speak.

I was super happy, although they don't serve my favourite mole dish which is chocolate from Oaxaca used as a sauce with usually chicken or enchiladas at least they had enchiladas Verde here which is my second favourite dish.

Despite the fact that I am a Charlotte native, born and bred, I have never been to the Penguin. Nor, until the visit described below, had I ever had a fried pickle.

There, I said it.  The past couple years, I've kept meaning to go to the Penguin and eat fried pickles, but I've always been put off by their post-Guy-Fieri explosion of crowded-ness (If only the entire world could be post-Guy-Fieri, but that's a conversation for another day).

Anyways, I digress.  This isn't a review of the Penguin: it's a review of the Diamond, another Charlotte institution that I waited far too long to visit.  After the rumpus about the Penguin's ownership settled down, I decided an outing to the Diamond was in order: it's now run by half of the Penguin's old ownership team, and I hoped the wait would be more reasonable than the Fieri-hailed restaurant mentioned above.

We arrived and were seated immediately.  +1 for the Diamond.  We started with a half order of fried pickles, which was more than enough for two people and quite tasty. I am not sure I am going to make fried pickles a regular part of my diet, but I'll certainly order them again.  For my main course, I ordered the Po' Boy Greek burger.  Now this ... this was delicious.  A lamb patty stuffed with feta? Just the right amount of saltiness and tang?  If you are looking for these qualities, you must try it.  The fries were good as well.  The only small culinary disappointment was the slaw on the side, which could have used some more vinegar or spices.

I've worked in the food industry and when you say that you close at 8:30, it doesn't mean that you stop accepting customers at 8:15 or even at 8:25.  You accommodate those customers as they still bring you income, turning back a party of 6 is a lost income.

They have bowls, tortas, burritos, tacos, a three taco plate that comes with rice and beans, and I also saw that they the have menudo and posole, YUM. 

I decided on four chicken tacos and my husband decided on the three chicken taco plate. The plate runs about $7 and each taco individual runs about $1.50. We each got our own drinks and those were, one soft drink and one agua fresca (Jamaica) We spent about $18. 

This place was chaotic inside. Finding a table was a challenge as there were a ton of other customers looking for somewhere to sit as well. Luckily, we found one right when someone else was leaving so we sat down quickly. 

We waited about 15 minutes for our food and they called it out by number. Our food was nice and hot so we quickly dug in. My chicken tacos were delicious. They were already dressed when I got them (cilantro, onion, and a green salsa) and so if you don't want any of the toppings make sure to let them know. 

My husbands beans were really dry so we didn't eat them. The rice was a little bit over cooked so it was a bit soggy. The flavor was good though so we ended up eating it all. 

They don't have a salsa bar but I did see red and green salsa bottles on the front counter. The inside of the restaurant is nicely kept and they had several tvs on as well as music. It was very loud on this day as there were a ton of people dining in.

Pros: EVERY seat is a gigantic leather recliner - unlike other premium theatres in Scottsdale such as Studio Movie Grille and iPic where you have to pay extra for automated recliners.  We visited twice in one week, and neither show was overly packed.  Even if the show was full, there are wide aisles and you would not be uncomfortable.

Cons:  You pay $2 extra per ticket to purchase online, and they do not offer a discount for matinees.  But $14 for an adult is still cheaper than iPic for reserved seating.

I am happily bumping this to a 5 star rating. 

Went in tonight for round two, to give them another shot. After my previous post, I was personally contacted by management and they thanked me for the feedback, said they would speak to chef about it, and that is super awesome. 

This time I had the daily special - chicken pot pie. Holy cow. Best pot pie I have *ever had.* The chicken was cooked so perfectly, the creamy sauce was spot on, and the puff pastry on top was light and flaky and amazing. They have a veggie pot pie on the regular menu that I must absolutely try next time I am in!

The BF had the chicken parm and he was very satisfied as well. It was huge! So much leftover!

I returned to this place for the first time in many, many years (I used to have violin lessons near this shop and ate here often), and boy am I glad I did. 

I got a gyro to-go and have to say, wow. Firstly, it's a well-proportioned gyro - not small but not gigantic in size, either. Yes, this is a big deal to me; I like a gyro that I can eat in one sitting since gyros are so messy that the leftovers don't do well during a trip home. Secondly, it's an affordable gyro; it cost me all of $5. Thirdly, as others have mentioned, the seasoning used here is perfect and different, probably because the owner really is from Cyprus and knows how to make authentic Greek food.

Yep, that's a lot to be wowed about. The whole thing is so awesome that I wish I had a better vocabulary to describe it, and I'm too satisfied after my meal to get a thesaurus to try to come up with anything.

I didn't get any sides and whatnot this time around, but I'll be back - hopefully for a sit-down meal so I can explore the rest of the menu.

In addition to the great food, this is a great, casual place that takes reservations, so if you have a special occasion and want to do lunch in the Strip, you won't have to wait for a table.

Here's my take:

- Bean dip app is nice - served hot, with some cheese on top and fresh green onions, it's tasty and the portion is definitely large enough to share. 

- I like the Cuban Sandwich, made with a proper sandwich press, so it's warm and just a little crisp on the outside. Kaya's version has some turkey in it.  Oddly, the pickles (a standard Cuban sammy ingredient) are served on the side.

- The Rainbow Salad is fresh and filled with lots of good stuff.  Plus, you can add a protein.

I've not tried the Kaya burger, nor the Kaya Veggie Burger, but each is on my list.  Plus, I suspect plenty of reviews have covered the burger already.

Staff: I think they need to work on their service skills. The wait staff is always standing around the counter and requires me to flag down and ask for refills and stuff. No one really checks in on you. Flagging down someone isn't a problem except how the place is set up (there's an elevated area), they can't see certain tables if they don't walk around. It's mildly frustrating at times.

Ambience: It's comfortable, but I would say it isn't very accessible to everyone since there's steps everywhere. However it's got a nice vibe going on.

Food: I had the Bolognese Fries to start. It's a hefty portion and the fries were not the best. The only word I can think to describe it is ""potato-like""? It wasn't quite fries, it wasn't quite wedges, and it wasn't quite potato skins; that's the only thing I can say.

Super cheap. When you check in they make you sign an agreed amount. Which is pretty cool seeing that I have went to other places that try to over charge after the service is complete.

PRO'S:
- 2 plasma tv (one in the bathroom)
- curtains & lights controlled by switches by bed
- bed was pretty comfortable

CON'S:
- walls were paper thin. could hear annoying people next door all night.
- rooms are still old, and you can tell in a lot of spots

My husband and I were not sure what to expect, this is in small shopping plaza and they were not very crowded. We were blown away with the flavorful entrees! They give you this yummy pretzel bread, and we had the potato pancake appetizer, although you could not taste the potato too much, they were dressed nice and presented particularly and didn't let down our palette. 

I had the Apple Butter Cod and loved it, my husband had the chicken paprikash, which looked a lot different than traditional fare. I would describe this as traditional German dishes with a modern almost fusion flare! We absolutely loved the food, the Chef is creative and partnered flavors together that were very nice on the tongue. The chicken pap almost had a smokey, bbq flavor to it, and it was a bone in chicken. Everything on the menu sounded so good it took a while to decide. Everything was flavorful and fresh. We tried 2 biers on tap, the German and the czech one and they were also delish. 

Another great thing about this place, was the atmoshphere and service. Our server, Shannon I think, was very pleasant and thoughtful and the owner even came over to ask us how everything was and told us about specials they have on Wednesday. This was above and beyond what we expected and we will be back here soon!

Prices of entrees seemed to hover around 14- 15.00 and the portions were enough but not over the top, but if you like to stuff yourself you might want to get an appetizer or dessert. We are so excited about this new addition!",2011-02-15 03:37:34

For lunch, they have this strange buffet service for everything except salads.  Counterintuitive, I know.  Usually they don't have anyone at the front desk to seat you, which is awkward.  Just go into the dining room and someone will figure out that you are there eventually.

If you want a sandwich, you need to get your lazy ass up, order from the guy with the chef's hat behind the sneeze guard, wait until he dishes out your food, go to another station to get your condiments, and walk your food back to your own damn table. Given the fact that the servers only have to fetch salads and drinks, you'd think the service would be excellent.  But unfortunately that's not the case.  

Drink refills tend to be hard to come by.  So much that when they drop off your drink, they'll give you a little carafe of extra soda, ice tea, whatever you ordered.  Because they ain't coming back.  If they gave you the wrong drink while you were off waiting in line for someone to make your sandwich, good luck getting it fixed.  It's also hard to get the check for some reason.  But the servers look really busy and there are a lot of them so they must be doing something.  I can never figure out what.  It's really hard to get their attention.  And never come on Administrative Assistant's Day or Bosses' Day or any of those made up holidays because it only gets worse with all the offices around this restaurant.  We loves us some fake holidays.

The sandwiches are pretty good and this is the only place in town that I know of that you can get a full turkey dinner for lunch anytime of the year.  It costs $24 but, still, it's nice to have the option.  The food is pretty decent but, in my experience, the service falls short, at least during lunch.",2011-10-28 00:34:54

Food - The menu is short and sweet. They have lots of Mexican favorites. My favorite are the street tacos. The chicken and steak are perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. The tortillas are fluffy, and the guacamole is fresh. They also bring out a large plate of rice and beans to share family style for the table.

Food:  The bread basket was amazing and beautifully presented.  Wish I could have tried everything without filling up before dinner!   Beef carpaccio, bone in filet, ribeye (bone in), au gratin potaotes, and compliementary butter cake (for our anniversary!).  I loved every bite of our meal.  The food was superb.

Drink:  As mentioned, Mike R let us sample the wines, and we selected the Earthquake, which he stated was from a boutique winery.  Huge thumbs up!!!!!  Next visit will include one of the cool looking cocktails!

The decor is beautiful, but then again everything in or on the Venetian is beautiful right? I had two different experiences each day. 

Day 1- Omelet du jour (spinach, mozzarella and tomato) and a side of bacon and the Strawberry champagne cocktail. 
- The presentation was lovely, the omelet was perfectly whipped and was almost too pretty to eat. The gravy boat of bacon was also a treat. However, I felt like the omelet was served luke warm and wasn't ""done"" enough on the inside and I got the feeling our waitress wasn't too thrilled to be at work that day. Lastly, my cocktail was too syrupy...the flavor was quite artificial. 

Day 2-
Sour Dough waffle - Totally different experience! The waffle was detectible, light and fluffy and the vanilla bean butter melted in my mouth! I would go back again and again for this dish. My cocktail the ""75"" was fantastic and perfectly balanced and lastly, our waitress was very sweet and friendly.

The oven is so hot it cooks in about 3 minutes.  The only down side is that when the pizzas come out, everyone descends on it and you might get two bites out of it.  So, you have to just keep making pizzas.

With Custom Built Pizza, I don't have to worry that my specially designed pizza is going to evaporate.  I decided to choose a gluten free crust, I mixed pesto and marinara sauces, added strips of good quality mozzerella, shredded mozzerella, peppers, black olives, basil, fresh pineapple and chicken sausage.  I was surprised at how quick the pizza was served.  I was apparently very thirsty as I drank two Arizona Teas with my pizza.  I loved this combination and it was something I wouldn't have tried on my own.  Everything was very fresh.

I had a very nice visit with Loren F. over dinner.  I was amazed I ate so much pizza but still had enough to take home for another meal.

We stopped by the Phoenix Public Market yesterday to check out Food Truck Fridays.  It was almost 2 p.m. and they were getting ready to close so after quickly surveying the six trucks, we decided on Jamburritos.

We ordered the chicken and okra gumbo and the fried catfish special.  Both were awesome.  The gumbo was a fairly large portion that was rich, flavorful and chock full of sausage, chicken and okra.  Absolutely delicious and a steal at five bucks.  The catfish was completely non-greasy and cooked perfectly, served with rice and greens.

Highly recommended.",2011-04-23 15:51:54

Because of the exciting choices on the menu, I was pumped to try out this place.  Armed with a Corporate card and a coworker, we arrived at Soul on a Wednesday evening and hardly had to wait.  We both got a table outside, which was actually really nice on an early fall evening.

Service was great - our server was very nice and our plates were cleared quickly and waters always full.  

For food, we ordered the following:

Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos - ain't nothin' ""Asian-glazed"" about these tacos... unless something like five spice qualifies as ""Asian"".  However, these were my favorite out of the bunch we ordered.  The pork belly was nicely cooked, really flavorful with the ""Asian Glaze"" and the watermelon salsa (really just marinated watermelon) added a nice flavor to the bite as a whole.  I would probably rather have this without the tortilla.

Ramen bowl - very large serving!  The first 5 bites of this was really good, but then it just really became way too salty.  The ramen noodles were nice and chewy and reminded me of the kind that comes in American instant ramen (Top Ramen).  What really stood out here were the veal cheeks that basically melted in your mouth and the amazing goat cheese fried mushrooms.  YUM.

Bone marrow - pass.  This hardly tasted like anything and was basically a ton of butter on some crostini.

Flatbread - truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic and fresh arugula - actually quite tasty, but hard to eat.  It was very soggy, but had really good flavor from the mix of ingredients.

Korean BBQ wings - I live in NYC... where Korean chicken wings are a real thing and really delicious.... unfortunately these do not compare.  Chicken wings need to be more crispy, in my opinion.

For dessert, we got the banana chocolate phyllo turnovers - such a good decision and at $5, it was very reasonably priced.  However the star of this show was the banana pudding ice cream - SO GOOD.  Too bad they don't sell it by itself.

I'm not really sure what to call this place... like an American/Asian ""fusion"" or what, but it's a decent place for drinks and tapas with a good environment.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to food, only because I've had far better in NYC.  Bottom line - decent food, great atmosphere.",2016-10-14 03:22:27

This place actually took over where 808 tapas used to be. I didn't know they closed down! Everything looked the same when we walked in though. Maybe different stuff on the walls.

It wasn't too busy so we sat down right away, AYCE dinner was 28$. A little more pricer than the usual. Once you check in you can get BOGO free house sake so I took advantage of that. But I decided plain sake isn't for me. 

The fish was pretty fresh. The rice/fish ratio was pretty even. That's always a pet peeve of mine at sushi restaurants. The menu had some amazing new items that you don't usually see BUT they weren't part of the AYCE which was a bummer. They did have oysters on the menu 1 order per person but they didn't have tabasco or the cocktail sauce you usually put on oysters. 

The jalapeÃ±o poppers were amazing and also the rock n roll was bomb. It's a rice less roll which I love love those! Looking over the menu again I forgot to try the Monkey brains. Dang it. 

I ordered seaweed salad, it had a really distinct Taste to it that I didn't really like. I got the green tea cheese cake and it was so small! I had to laugh because I saw pictures of it but didn't think it really was as small as it looked in pictures until it was in front of me.

2x Thai Ice Tea                   $1.95 each

The fried rice was well seasoned all around, had bits of carrots, onions, peas, green onions, and scrambled eggs. The Pad Thai was delicious, a generous plateful of slippery rice noodles with the perfect blend of sauce and heat. I really appreciated the large side of bean sprouts, so that you can add as much and as little as you like.

It's a very family run place, the tables were all full during lunch service on a Wednesday, with a heavy flow of take-out orders.

The mousaka and pasteesto were very overcooked and just mush, no texture at all. The vegetables were unseasoned and overcooked as well. Received the snapper in clam sauce and although the flavor was spot on, my dish was microwaved, or as it seemed. The fish had great flavor but again was mush, and came out so hot that you know it didn't come out of a SautÃ© pan. Our tab was eighty dollars without any alcohol and the dishes were subpar.

Now I'm kicking myself - it was better than I imagined!

Zack and I met a few friends for dinner and although the restaurant was pretty quiet on a Saturday night, I almost felt like we walked into a friend's house... the whole family was there!  Menh Ho and Hien Le (the couple that owns it) were extremely welcoming and friendly... their 2 kids were there as well and so were the grandparents!  (The kids are so cute by the way!)  But I digress...

The menu was much larger than I expected.  My last experience with Vietnamese food was years ago in Atlanta and I remember a limited menu.  Not at Saigon Nites!  It was hard to decide what to order since everything sounded delectable.  We ended up sharing an order of the eggplant in garlic sauce for the table... well, that was the intention but I thought it was heavenly and probably at the majority of it!  I sampled Zack's Pho (which he orders with extra veggies) and was secretly wishing I'd ordered my own... but my Vermicelli Noodle entree with shrimp and veggies was pretty damn tasty too.  I think the sweet fish sauce served with it totally makes the dish.  Do as Zack instructed me - just pour it all on and enjoy!  

Our friends seemed to enjoy the Vietnamese Curry, Pho, and a dish that looked to me like Pad Thai.  We watched another table enjoy the Rice Crepe (Banh Xeo) and all of us had some order envy with that one; I'll have to remember for next time.  And there will be a next time sooner rather than later as Saigon Nites is going to be thrown in the mix of regulars for me.

(A lot of it made right in Tempe.) They also carry meats, artisan breads, milk, soy milk, chips, candy, coffee, tea, syrup, and granola. They even carry pain killer, allergy medicine and condoms.

I loved the mild spice from the Serrano chiles paired with the sweetness from the agrodolce (which was like a honey). The hubby's ravioli was rich and comforting, but the portion was just right: not too big yet not too small. My swordfish was good, yet not quite the best swordfish dish I've ever had. The flavors were light, but I feel it was missing something, which I'm not sure what. At the end of the meal, they brought out two salted caramels which were such a nice surprise and a great way to end our meal!

I enjoyed everything about Casbah, from the service, the experience, to the food. I would definitely dine here again!",2016-09-06 16:04:26

I wasn't fond of our table but it wasn't uncomfortable by any means. The server was great with timing whether taking our order, delivering food or grabbing the check.

The BIGGEST plus I give Harlow's, the portions are perfect when sharing between two people and holy cow, the potato's weren't swimming in grease on my plate! Hallelujah. I love me some potato's and its too bad they are nutritionally worthless and so yummy. We ordered the two egg breakfast which comes with potato's and your choice of a side and we went with rye toast.

When u walk in right next to the door by the shoe closet you have this hand sanitizer and we thought that its was wonderful since i can imagine many kids and adults been sick this time of the year among other germs and we try to be really careful about that  

Long story short ,the lady  greated us and explain to us since it was our first time here and handed us a pad  you fill it up with parents names , kids name etc... if you dont have socks they do , i aint sure if they are free or you pay but its good to know - you place your shoes on a open closet and get ready to explore with your kids the place and if you planning a party for the kids they do have a separate room for that 

This place is sock friendly and they only charge $10 per kid /adults are free and not only that it gets better !!!! you get free coffee or tea and best of all a free massage. (20 min as courtesy to others) 
Thats perfect !!!! If you have little girls you can have a  fun time as well on the nail station DIY and theres is plenty room for you to sit or drink your drink /snack 

The place was bussy for a Tuesday  around 10am but it was fun all the other older kids where really careful with the little ones ( we thank that those parents teach older kids to be careful and polite ) 

On the play area  there is staff who watch the kids as well to explain how things work or look after their safety along with cameras  that monitor the kids and the whole place (makes u feel safer )  theres so much fun climbing, sliding , also they have piano (little play piano) for the kids , cars  you can push your kids or they can do it themselves  , area for little babies (toddlers) building foam blocks 
Another Area with kitchen , mini market stand and protected with foam for when the kids fall they don't get hurt bad 

We played for hours and we loved it

My husband and I shared the Naked City Pizza and Pizza Logs. The Pizza Logs were really good and I loved the crunchy wrapping on the outside. The pizza had a great taste and we both really enjoyed it. I was also able to taste some of the other items at the table. The Suicide Fries were great and definitely didn't hold back on the heat. This would definitely hit the spot for those that can't get enough heat. The Poutine was not that exciting and I normally really like poutine. I enjoyed the Braised Short Rib Stroganoff, great flavor. Overall, the food exceeded my expectations and I would like to try more of the menu.

The service was the worst I've had in recent memory. Maybe something was going on personally with the waitress because she had an unjustified attitude and really didn't take good care of our table. My husband and I asked for silverware since she didn't bring enough and she brought one set for the two of us. I thought maybe we were on a hidden camera prank show.

My first time at Izakaya Ju and it's a little too early to give them the full 5 stars... so they're getting 4.5!

Just like everything in J-town, it's a small space but they could handle a big group (12-15ppl, keeping this place in mind to take my whole family) and still have space for more diners without being squished or bumped around.  Staff greets you when you arrive or leave, but not as loud as they would at Guu. Service was quick and always with a smile.

I dined with a 2 friends for lunch.  We shared:
- Beef tongue soy sauce and mustard
soft meat and good flavour
- Grilled mackarel
I like mackarel, my friends not so much... more for me ;)
- Octopus balls (takoyaki)
Loved it! They are on the small side, but great flavour and they're loaded with octopus.
- Beef garlic fried rice
Mmmm... my only problem was I had to eat it with chopsticks!
- Pork cheek yakitori
O so tender and just seasoned with salt... Yumm!
- Chicken leg yakitori, sauce
Nice juicy dark meat
- Cod yakitori
Totally different flavour from the strong mackarel, but still good.
- Leg and leek yakitori, sauce
Nice and soft, the leek enhances the flavour
- Pork belly yakitori, sauce
It's pork and belly... can't go wrong with that =D
- Tsukune, sauce
ground chicken ball, always curious how they make it and it tastes good
They give you a choice to either have your yakitori salted or sauced.

Bill came up to $85 including tax and 20% tip which is very reasonable.

I brought my boyfriend here for lunch when we were in Vegas. We came here for lunch because we found out via the website that they have a much cheaper lunch menu!

We ordered the prime rib lunch special (he got the Lawry's cut, I ordered the luncheon cut). It comes with the prime rib, mashed potatoes, a side, bread, and their whipped horseradish. The prime rib was still flavorful and whatnot. The mashed potatoes weren't up to par with the Beverly Hills location, which is a huge bummer for me, because I LOVE my potatoes. We both ordered the creamed corn on the side and we split an extra side of the creamed spinach (with bacon!). They were good too in terms of flavor.

The way it works though, is that instead of them taking the order and bringing the food to you, you go to the mini carvery corner and get the food yourself. The problem with that is that the meat sits out longer because the carver cuts them for people in line and so by the time you get the table it cools down a lot. Also, the creamed corn just sits in the heated pots (like how they serve soups at buffets), so it starts to separate, bunching up on top. The server mixes it together before he serves it, but if I'm paying a lot for food, I don't want that kind of quality.

I'm sure the dinner is much better, of course, but I didn't want to come to Lawry's for dinner in Las Vegas, when we have one in LA anyways. I'd rather go somewhere I can't find near home!",2013-02-21 23:49:47

Many just stop me to chit chat with me about my baby.  This to me shows they take an interest in their customers and it makes me feel welcome. 
A good note to say also is they can figure out what a ""thing a magig"" is your looking for and never have looked at me like ""OMG we have another stupid women""!

Unless you can guilt a friend or loved one into driving you, this is the only way. Also you must know, I am now singing to myself ""this is how we airport"" in the tune of Montell Jordan as I write this.

I get a lot of anxiety going to the airport. It has zero to do with flying. Should I Uber? Call a cab? Drive and park in daily? Every time I attempt the long term lot, I can't find my car. It turns into what feels like a never-ending real-life Hunger Games to locate it, and I don't even get to become besties with Lenny Kravitz. Like how I found a way to work Montell and Lenny into an airport parking review? I deserve 5 stars.

My fellow North Carolina angel Holly B is the one who introduced me to this. You check-in at the gate and then a driver follows you to your parking spot. I pulled into one by a giant puddle. I got out and the driver said, ""let's find you a better spot so your feet don't get wet."" Lifesaver. I found a new spot, he grabbed my giant suitcase to load onto the van, and drove me right to the airport.

Nine days later, same drill but in reverse. Those drivers were lifesavers. This girl packed way too much in her suitcase. It was too heavy for me to try and get in the back of Not Lance. (that's my car). Every worker I dealt with was super friendly, too.

Check out was simple and easy. The cashier even offered me a bottle of water. This was nice because I had just flown in from San Francisco and forgot what humidity felt like. Holy. My total for parking nine days: $54.45.

I didn't make a reservation online. I would recommend doing that, especially during busy holidays. I believe it's also a little cheaper if you book online. They also offer a frequent parker program and corporate discounts.",2015-07-28 23:23:14

I had the first burger on the menu, which is their standard beef burger and my dining partner had a bison burger (special of the day). I remember mine absolutely delectable. I might have taken a bite of the bison burger too, but cannot remember much of that because my tastebuds were swimming in the pleasures of my beef burger. It was seriously good.

We've had many food items here and it's a wonder that I hadn't written my review until now. We've had the regular swedish meatballs along with all the fixings- the steamed veggies, the mashed potatoes (I am really picky with this dish, and I really like theirs), the chicken meatballs (these are my favorite- we even buy the frozen bag downstairs, to have some on hand, in a pinch- there is so much you can do with these meatballs), the chicken cordon bleu (sold out--- aww man!), the salmon sandwich (this was really good, but isn't always available), the chicken fingers, the mediterranean wrap (veggies- it's very tasty), the coffee (also has decaf), the coconut oat balls (these are so yummy), the cake. I don't think that we've ever had a bad meal here- and we've eaten here a lot!

We have not been to the special dining days, though, we've heard many good things about those times, too. We have not tried the breakfast, but have also heard many good things about it as well.   

Some items are self-serve (salad, corn bread), while the hot items are served by the food service clerks (you can also ""substitute""). Don't forget to grab your trays and a cart. If you are a friends and family member, scan your card for free coffee. Checkout is usually fast. That is, if the line for getting food is not long. We've been getting lucky lately, but we did actually wait in that long line, once. The cashiers are also nice, too. I almost forgot to mention that the prices are pretty good, too.   

Seating is pretty massive (features their line of furniture, how clever!), but our boy likes to play after his meal, so we are usually seated near the play area for the kiddos. If you are lucky, you'll find a spot where the sun doesn't get in your face. Sometimes the tables are clean, sometimes they are not.

Usually I hate going to ramen restaurants due to the long lineup and the food not living up to the hype, but Koi is definitely a ramen restaurant that I will for sure to revisit and recommend. 

Environment:
The plaza is pretty easy to find and get to if you drive a car. But then again, it is super inconvenient to get anywhere if you don't own a car in Markham/Richmond Hill. There are plenty of parking at the plaza, however, it seems that there are more cars now due to the new hot pot place that recently opened, but there are still loads of parking space at the back. 
The restaurant itself is pretty small though, best for a casual dine-out for groups of 4 and under. 

Food:
Since this is a ramen restaurant it's no brainer that you must try their ramen dishes. Me and my friend both decided to order the Hokkaido Ramen (about $10) plus a Deep Fried Pork Cutlet (about $5) on the side, just in case there wasn't enough toppings in the ramen. The ramen ended up being really filling though, and for the toppings there was 1 egg, 2 slices of bbq pork, 1 small slice of fish ball, some corn, black fungus, green onion, and a strip of seaweed in the bowl. The soup was really nice and creamy, and it was relieving to see that there was no MSG in it since I didn't get super thirsty after the meal. The Pork Cutlet wasn't that good in my opinion and the batter is a little too thick. If you feel that you won't be full from the ramen you should just add extra pork to the noodle as opposed to order side dishes.  
They also have tofu cheesecake for $4 a slice, but I was already too full after my meal to give it a try. The alcohol menu was pretty large as well and they have some other interesting Japanese beverages.

Service:
The service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive and she would come by on occasion to ask how the food is and to refill our tea.",2016-11-21 20:47:16

They run GREAT deals and definitely are about putting their customers on a high priority. I come to this Coscto in particular at least 2-3 times a month. I love that their fruits and vegetables are in a controlled temperature room and they are always stocking throughout the day. 

I would recommend their pound cake, cheese cake, Kirkland all beef hot dogs, pizza from the food court, and so much more! One of the things I value the most is if you take something home and you find the quality is not good, you can bring it back and they will exchange it for you for free. One time I bought strawberries that were starting to mold. I called them and told them about it and they said to bring them back in and they would give me a new pack of fruit. They do that with all of their food. Just extremely customer friendly and helpful. I was sad to learn that the food court go rid of their ice cream bar which was very popular. Hopefully they bring it back. Their pizzas are HUGE. All pizzas are 1 size which I would measure to be XXL. They can feed up to 6-7 adults. We often call ahead of time and place a order for a full pizza so that when we get to the store, the pizza is made and ready. Much better than Pizza Hut and your other typically pizza chain. Their pizzas are amazing. 


Costco is my first choice for getting tires. They typically run a Michellin deal buy 4 tires and get $70 off.

We recently were in Italy and had AMAZING pizza there, but thought this place could at least come close based on what I read. And we were right! Not quite as good as authentic Italian pizza, but pretty dang close. Wood-fired and made to order, the add-ons of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella were worth it. The glass of wine was a little pricey for the size, but it was a nice house-red. The cannolis were nothing special, but the husband enjoyed the specialty dessert of a graham cracker cake. 
I do wish they listed the size of the pizza on the menu board. We were not aware of the size and ordered 1 to split. They are small enough that 1 is a enough for one person, and we probably could have gotten our own. 
I do love that they offer take-out and if I lived any closer, that could be very dangerous for my wallet with the prices they offer.

*** 4.5 stars ***

This is truly a throwback to a bygone era.  Classy, old school, soft lighting, nice music quietly playing so you can have a conversation--you know--like the good old days.

Course 1:  The Original Spinning Bowl Salad--Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with our exclusive Vintage Dressing (from the Lawry's menu.  The server wheels a cart with a stainless bowl of greens.  This bowl is in a second bowl that has ice to keep the greens chilled.  The server spins the bowl in the ice and lifts the Lawry's salad dressing high and pours it over the spinning bowl.  It's plated and served.  Very old school way of doing things but it's lots of fun.  

Course 2:  I chose the Lawry cut of prime rib--a 10 ounce slice of prime rib.  The other option was salmon but why the hell would I come to this restaurant to eat salmon?  The ribs are wheeled in a large covered cart to your table where the server asks you how you want the prime rib done and what sides you want.  I went with the standard mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  While the chef was cutting the meat and putting the sides together, my server, Mrs. Bender (sort of like Charlotte Rae from ""The Facts of Life"" TV show) went off to the kitchen to get my Yorkshire pudding, something I haven't had in years.  The chef placed the meat on my table, and she used two forks to cut the pudding into four roughly equal pieces/.  She had already brought a mild and strong horseradish, so I was ready to dig in.  The meat was tender.  No steak knife is needed here and the potatoes and creamed spinach were top notch!

Course 3:  How can you get to dessert and not choose a chocolate bag.  Too bad it wasn't the size of a Macy's shopping bag but you can't have everything!  The menu describes the bag this way:  Filled with a double rich Belgium mousse, fresh assorted berries with a raspberry Chambord sauce, topped with mint and shaved chocolate.  The bag is a rectangular shaped piece of chocolate filled with the goodies described.  It was superb!

The whole experience was pleasant from being greeted at the door and the woman who verified my reservation.  I especially liked the sign telling men to take the damn hats off before entering the dining room.  It's a shame the sign has to be there, but I liked it!  Mrs. Bender was a gem.  She was like a little house mother with her cart, her spinning bowl, her orchestrating the various aspects so the cart got to me and the meat was what I wanted before she dashed to get the Yorkshire pudding.  Service was impeccable.

La Madre looked absolutely stunning after the brief storm system finally moved away from the Valley. My mother and I hiked up this moderate beautiful trail the past two Thursdays in hopes of reaching the springs as well as catching some snow remnants and we were not disappointed. 

The trail system can be accessed either from White Rock Loop or from the Picnic Area, the latter of which would require you to go through nearly a couple of miles of dirt road to get here. Be careful if you decide to take the dirt path route. Cars drive in and out of that bumpy road and some of them are not very slow. You will only begin to feel the incline once you reach the La Madre Trail head. Bring lots of water and know how to pace yourselves. Take in the majestic views every once in a while and rest on some of the rocks for a snack. About 200 yards from the spring, you'll find the remains of what we ascertain to be a house. Its floor tiles are still pretty intact and there's a pipe coming down straight from the spring. Maybe it was more useful back then.

Today, the spring is nothing more than a running stream with dense algae, and I could only say that after the ice caps melted. Who knows how it looks during the 110 degree months. This, of course, makes for a perfect spring hike. It takes some stamina to get up there so bump up the calories during breakfast and snack on some granola bars. You'll need energy to overcome a 900 elevation gain over a 2-ish mile one way trip. If you intend to complete the White Rock Trail, hike about 1.3 miles till you see a fork. Turn right and enjoy some 5 miles of flatter land. That'll be a good option for a longer day hike.",2015-03-05 00:01:32

I literally cleaned my plate. There was NOTHING left when the waiter came back to remove my plate. I'll admit I was very hungry, however I am picky when it comes to fish and my salmon was cooked perfectly. It was also seasoned nicely. Not too salty or with other overwhelming spices.

Used it for my wife's birthday with a group of 8. We started with a wonderful Pizza that was easily up to NYC standards (Owner Jimmy is from LI). All the starters and especially the Greek Salad had rave reviews. Cocktails were excellent and the Watermelon Sangria on special hit the spot. Everyone's entree was declared delicious with ample portions, my lasagna was outstanding and the angel hair pasta had 5 stars. The highlight of the meal was dessert with the New York Cheesecake as the star of the show. Second billing went to the very creamy and Gelatos - probably the best in the valley bar none, the Pistachio was very tasty. The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent.

On a next visit the Margarita pizza was still up to NYC standards. The Spaghetti Carbonara was perfection and left my mouth very happy. The Pasta Arrabiata was an unusual variation and spiced perfectly. Again the meal ended with the very special gelatos.

It took a minute or two for someone to show up at the hostess station to seat us. 
A quick caveat, the booth seats are NOT attached to the walls as is typical, so get prepared for a ride if you try to slide out or scoot towards or away from the table as the booth will likely accompany you!
I got the #8 combination plate, a beef taco and a beef burrito with rice and beans.  My wife got shrimp fajitas.  Our waiter was a happy polite and efficient fellow, and all the staff seemed to be particularly happy.  
One fellow felt compelled to sing along to the mariachi music playing on the sound system and by sing I mean bellowing fortissimo!
That wasn't especially welcomed by my wife's migraine, and was definitely something more suited to an empty dining room over one which held patrons.  I was tickled that he was so joyful that he was compelled to sing, and if he had a volume control or mute button would largely have enjoyed it had the headache not been present.
The food was quite good.  The requisite chips were served warm, and the salsa was fresh and homemade. 
We were both quite satisfied with our entrees.  My wife felt hers was one of the best Mexican entrees she had been served anywhere, including her time in San Diego. She was particularly impressed by the correctly prepared shrimp...something quite hard to find anywhere. 
The iced tea was fresh-brewed and strong enough that one actually knew one was drinking  tea rather than colored water.

There is nothing pretentious about La Mexicana, including owner Roberto who sports a soul patch and perfect English.  The walls are decorated with memorabilia and the tables are large, solid and sturdy.  

What makes La Mexicana worth the trip is the food.  It's made fresh daily in the small kitchen.  There are 3 kinds of chili (what we gringos call salsa) 2 red and 1 verde each with a distinct flavor.  

The carne asada is is grilled, thinly cut and goes well in the ample burritos filled with rice, beans and fresh cilantro.  

The chili verde, chucks of pork in a nice tasty brown sauce are equally at home as a stand alone dish over rice with beans and salad on the side or stuffed into a burrito, enchilada or taco.  

La Mex is about as authentic as it gets.  A working persons cafe, it is always filled with locals on a break from work, holding meetings or watching the huge TV that dominates the corner playing ""futbol' or Telenovelas or the latest musical offerings live from Mexico City.

Made reservations through Open Table for the Friday before Mother's Day at 8:00 pm. Unbelievable how busy it was as we walked in.

Waited at the entry for about 10 minutes as we waited by the V Lounge with great live music.

The atmosphere is very nice with low lighting to add to your experience. 

We started off with the Point Judith Calamari which was prepared in a Kung Pao Style with Roasted Cashews and Crisp Noodles. We had the sauce on the side to ensure we did not get our mouth flamed out. Portion was pretty good to share and not too hot.

We ordered the Chilean Seabass which was steamed in a Hong Kong Style Light Soy Broth which was so tender that it just melted in your mouth. This was a nice choice and would recommend.

We also ordered the 34 oz Porterhouse Steak that we shared, that was a monster of a steak and my son and I could not finish. This dish was also a winner being so tender and prepared as requested. 

The last entree was the Bay of Fundy Salmon which was sautÃ©ed with Young Vegetables and Maille Mustard Vinaigrette which was also a wonderful dish.

We shared 2 sides, the Broccolini with Lemon and Garlic and the Parmesan and Chive French Fries which were both okay, would prefer to order others next time.

For dessert we had their signature dessert which was the Hot Bananas Foster Butter Cake which was a show and a delite by itself. Our waiter, Brenon, lit the container and then poured the flaming sauce over the butter cake. I have to say if both of my kids are video taping the flaming dessert they were impressed by the presentation. The taste did not disappoint, if you eat here you have to order this dessert. One of the best desserts we have ever had.

Have to say the service was excellent and our waiter Brenon was on top of everything with his recommendations and taking care of us.

What a great experience and meal, would highly recommend and definitely would come back again.",2016-05-07 06:47:31

To give you an idea of what I mean:  a couple next to us ordered tea.  The wait staff brought a cart by with a variety of live potted tea plants.  While wearing white gloves, they cut the individual tea leaves off to put in a cup of warm/hot water, which was heated by a small candle.

While walking to the restaurant, I was a little skeptical that the ambiance would live up to its reputation.  Located in the middle of MGM Grand, you pass slot machines in a smoke filled casino when walking to the entrance.  However, once inside, you are transported to the serene, rich, and romantic world of Joel Robuchon.

Plush purple seats, amazing artwork, beautiful floral arrangements, and a stunning chandler in the center of the room.  The bathrooms, while chic, were actually a little difficult to use.  Everything was black.  The floors, the toilet, the sink, the linens--everything black.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but the lighting in the bathroom is pretty low, making it seem like you're taking a pee and washing your hands in outer space.

The food was exquisitely presented and flawlessly executed.  There was never a hint of sloppiness or unsteady hand.  This was a masterful representation of culinary precision.

HOWEVER...
*************
Ultimately, for a 3 Michelin star restaurant and a $600+ bill for two, I expect the absolute best dining experience of my life.  Everything here was the best I've ever experienced--except for the food.  There was not a single dish that I will remember.  All of the dishes tasted good, but none were exceptional in my mind.  This is the sole reason I gave four out of five stars.

I may not have eaten at other 3 Michelin star restaurants, but I have eaten at other 5-star AAA restaurants and James Beard Award-winners' restaurants.  It was there that I experienced the sensation of my jaw dropping and my mouth watering long after eating--not at Joel Robuchon.
*************

I still implore you to come here if you want to experience the best service, presentation, and ambiance a restaurant can offer.


I thought my review was starting to run long, so here is a quick summary of the individual food dishes I tried:

For our anniversary, we got the 4-course menu selection.

Caviar L'Amuse-bouche: presented in a round metal tin, which was both cool and tacky.  It felt a little like I was being served a can of sardines.  It tasted good enough, but I still don't see what the big deal about caviar is.

Truffled langoustine ravioli: the umami flavor from the truffles floods your palette, but then leaves a sweet lobster finish. 

Foie gras with artichoke: pretty and well balanced.  

Chestnut soup: Tasted like a bacon latte.

Pan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass-way too much lemon flavor.  I couldn't taste anything else.

Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach: perfectly cooked and tender.  

Fuji apple confit, cinnamon sable and Manzana milkshake: I probably would've preferred a brownie and ice cream over this dish.

Guanaja chocolate with coffee ice cream, caramelized puffed rice and lemon confit: ice cream and chocolate were yummy, but the lemon confit took over the whole dish.

They offer dozens of different breads.  Butter from France, olive oil from Spain.

To finish the meal, they offer 60 or so different varieties of little chocolates.  My favorite was the French Mystery.  Imagine the tiniest possible little bite size Ã©clair.  And then, imagine it has a little baby, and that baby sits on top of its mommy.  Now you're picturing the French Mystery.

To celebrate our anniversary, the restaurant surprised us with a sorbet and coconut cake with orange sauce.",2011-02-14 20:59:57

I made it in time for happy hour but no hamburgers other  than sliders were on the menu. 

The Hawaiian is what I wanted and at around $9.00 I was ok since it came with Onion Rings. Order arrived with 4 yes 4 onion rings. I asked the bar tender/ waitress if this was it, and she assured me it was. She did offer me another side but I said no. Disappointed with the onion rings, I cut my hamburger in 1/2 and proceeded to eat. Frankly it was boring, slice of pineapple a bit of Teriyaki and 3/8"" slice of onion on a bun that was as boring as the hamburger. Waitress brought me 4 more onion rings which were the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately, others arrived at the bar, a heavily tattooed Mohawk wearing individual with girlfriend.

Located right in the plaza at the intersection of Woodbine and 16th Ave where the TNT plaza is. It's located further back nearby the One's and All star wings. 

Just recently opened just last week on December 12-14. The newly just opened Chatime and Bakecode contains fresh in house baked Taiwanese buns, breads, and deserts. Also to go along are all the chatime drinks where most locations contain similar types of drinks. 

Interior decor is very nice with new modern sliding design for when you choose your buns. Most drink selection are the same at all other locations. 

Unfortunately the most common problem /downfall that occurs at every new Chatime/Bakecode that opens is there speed and efficiency of operation. Staff are understaffed and seems to be not trained or ready for moderate to high traffic flow of customers yet. Went during a non peak time and there were at most only 4 other people inside. And took over 20 mins to gather all the items bought and get out. That's way too long.

It is run by a Vietnamese couple who are handle the massive amounts of foot traffic through here with diplomacy and poise. Also given the fact that a lot of said foot traffic takes place in the hours right after midnight, it makes it that much more impressive. 

The slices are thin crust with a light amount of cheese. Although I enjoy a cheese heavy pizza, when it's on thin crust it's better to go with less as they have here. The sauce is very tasty and the cheese slice is kind of marguerita style without the basil leafs. But the finishing touch and what takes it from normal to what people are talking about is this garlic and herb oil they have to paint over the slice. My cousin told me about this as I would have otherwise probably just ignored it, but it takes the slice from great to 'I have lost the power of speech' in a very short amount of time. It's just phenomenal. The pepperoni slice is also good, but I'd say the nod goes to the cheese slice.

The food is gorgeous, it is art. Margaritas have their own menu. I don't give 5 stars for this reason, I just wish there was a Taco that was just not so spicy. When they say it's not spicy, it still hurt me- (BBQ mahi taco, fantastic) but I have to disclose I have an incredibly low spice tolerance. Even though it was spicy (for me, and I stress that) I could taste such amazing blends of flavors, and the quantity of meat and fun in the taco is more the size of a burrito, so don't shy from the price. Too it all off with friendly, likable, helpful staff. Love you Cabo Fish Taco, please give me one..

Mentally, I was prepared to do Calico Tanks, which is a pretty easy hike.  I had to go from leisure mode to beast-mode with the quickness.  The hike is as difficult as everyone stated in their reviews.  The first .5 miles of the hike is flat and easy.  The rest is 2 miles of torture.  You'll definitely test your physical abilities, balance, and will power as your climb to the top.  The trail is marked with a clear trail path, signs, spray paint markings, and even ribbon on branches. You'll hit a few switchbacks where you can get a little rest.  We did the hike during the middle of winter and as we got closer to the top we had another obstacle...snow and ice. The trail became very difficult to follow because of the snow.  I took advantage of the two other hikers that made it to the top before us. I used their footprints as a guide up.  We finally made it to the top and the view was worth it.  You get a full view of Red Rock Canyon, the Strip, and the Mt. Charleston area. I read a tip that you can even see Lake Mead on a clear day.  We settled at the top, took our pictures, and admired the gorgeous views.  The hike down is not easy either.  The hike up tested my endurance and cardio. The hike down tested my balance and joints. I made sure to watch every step on the way down.  As we got to the bottom, we greeted a bunch of hikers on the way up to Turtlehead Peak.  They all looked cheerful and had huge Kool Aid smiles.  Little do they know what lies ahead.  Overall, I love this hike.  I love everything about it. If you haven't done this hike before, then I suggest that you do your homework first. Be prepared for a long strenuous hike up and a great view from the top. 

TIP #1:  Bring enough hydration, duh!
TIP #2:  Bring food to fuel you. 
TIP #3:  Don't forget to sign the notebook at the top.  We forgot!!!
TIP #4:  Don't yell ""I'm the King of the world"" when you're at the top. That's so 1997.  
TIP #5:  Have fun and most importantly, be safe

My bf and I decided to give it a try after I was raving about it to him. The experience turned out to be a sour one.

It wasn't even busy made only 3 tables full..we weren't greeted and the worker kept saying that she will serve us in a minute a few times (not sure what she was doing). The manager also looked like he wasn't having a good day, didn't even smile or acknowledge the customers that were there. Basically as soon as you walk in you can't tell if its a sit down restaurant or a fast food joint. It was way too fancy to be a fast food restaurant but they had no servers. You order your food at the front and they bring the food to you. 

We ordered what we would normally get at a middle eastern restaurant: chicken schwarma plate and fattoush salad with chicken. The server that took our order asked if we want hummus so we said ""sure"" not realizing that it would cost us $6! Total order later was $31 after we looked at our receipt..the worker didn't even tell us that there would be an extra charge for the hummus. Way to upsell? Thats pretty damn expensive for a dip and funny enough this was the only item that actually tasted good: the hummus dip and pita that came with it. My fattoush salad was nothing special it had some sort of vinaigrette dressing and pita chips (didn't like how that tasted in the salad). They also forgot the chicken on the salad which they remembered 5 mins later. The chicken was mediocre, was shredded into small pieces so made it seem like you were getting a lot but really it was just the leftovers that they had. The chicken was salty and oily, I had a weird after taste in my mouth. My bf ordered the chicken schwarma plate...same shredded chicken pieces and the fries that he ordered tasted like McCain fries. 

Overall, our experience was not what we expected. Food did not taste authentic and it's overpriced for what you get. The extra dollars that you are paying for definitely is going to the appearance and and insensible playground area in the restaurant.",2016-02-24 03:16:16

I'll take my ticket to a cart across the room if we've been waiting too long. There are too many dishes to go over, but the congee here is excellent. The only dish that fell short was the har gow - skin too thick and shrimp was mushy and falling apart.

Given the star power that regularly graces the Strip, my Egg Works sighting might not be too stirring, but when I saw members of the Wranglers hockey team, it thrilled me. They practice at the nearby ice facility, so I imagine they do coffee and eggs at the Works fairly often.

I do too, but I must admit that the 2 for 1 entrÃ©e coupons in my edition of The View are a big big incentive, as is the banana nut muffin. That muffin is habit forming! Just so you know, the muffin is an option in addition to the usual toast you get offered at breakfast restaurants.  Muffin or toast: you would be crazy not to choose this muffin.

Egg Works is technically a chain; the sister restaurant close to us is The Egg & I, but I think Egg Works is a smidgen nicer. It is a newer location. There is also Egg Works II on Sunset. Completely unrelated to the food, but they have a great website, so if you have any questions, you should visit it.

As you may have guessed, eggs are their specialty, so there are plenty of omelets and scrambles and sunny-side ups. The menu is pretty extensive, and they do have non-egg items such as buckwheat pancakes! They also have lunch, including hamburgers. They offer egg whites and egg substitute in addition to your regular chicken eggs. Often, the tastiest thing is their special of the day. The best thing I have eaten there was a chicken and pesto scramble special! Generally, I will get a scramble with vegetables, which are always fresh, not canned. I will say that the eggs can taste pretty plain, but I think they want to leave it to you to add salt, pepper and hot sauce to satisfy your own personal taste level. 

The serving sizes are very generous and include a mighty helping of their breakfast potatoes. The potatoes are diced and are not greasy at all. The secret to their tastiness is the magic dust--a little spicy, a little salty, a lot of yummy. 

The service is always attentive, and the servers generally look like they are having fun. They work as a team, which always makes service snappier. If you need something, there is a little egg on your table that you can flip. Now that's using your egg. Bwahahaha!

Overall, I think that Egg Works is a solid option for breakfast. There is something for everyone, the ingredients are fresh and the execution is respeggtable. (I can't resist a good egg pun.)",2010-03-15 17:59:29

In addition to tacos, we also shared the tuna tartar and the customized guacamole. There was a bit too much cucumber garnishing the tartar.

One room is dramatically situated in a round rotunda, where my partner and I had a wonderfully romantic dinner. Soft live jazz music played softly in the background while we enjoyed a cross section of delightful menu items.

Dinner was truly memorable with a starter of Tuna Tartare. Beautiful sashimi quality tuna was set an top of diced mango then topped with just the slightest amount of sliced chile. The heat was mild and only helped to accentuate the sweetness of the fish and mango. This was followed up by a gorgeous long plate filled with a mix of lightly dusted flash fried calamari, julienne carrots and daikon drizzled with a sweet soy glaze. My entree was on the lighter side but was heavy on flavor. Crab Stuffed Shrimp were excellent; extra large shrimp were grilled then topped with sweet crab meat, panko bread crumbs and a lime finish. I couldn't stop eating there plump crustaceans. I did however stop long enough to try my partners perfectly tender Steak au Poivre.

Edelweiss is THE biggest German store in our city, and THE biggest I've ever seen. They've got everything from German chocolate to German tabloids. They specialize in German imports and a visit is more of an experience than a shopping trip. 

To add to their unparalleled selection of German goods, they have an in-store restaurant where you can eat cabbage rolls, Bratwurst and Schnitzel to your heart's content. They even have a vegetarian menu!!! Oh, and don't even get me started on their desserts. Seriously, just lock me in overnight with nothing but a fork. 

My words can't possibly do Kaffe Stube justice, so I took a whack load of pictures so you can get an idea of what a jaw-dropping experience it is. 

Honestly - Edelweiss Village is my absolute favourite Calgary discovery so far!

The ""bar"" part is a joke - it's a tiny counter right where you walk in the door, with about 4 stools.  The restaurant has no atmosphere and the food was just so-so.  

There's quite a variety of offerings on the menu, including salads, pita wraps, subs, pizza, and entrees.  However, you will quickly notice that many of the items are exactly the same with one variation, i.e. two subs with chicken and onions but one has cheese and the other has jalapenos.  I asked if I could get the vegetable ""sub"" as a ""pita sub"" and was told that that just wouldn't work.  So I settled on one of the chicken pitas.   

The pita itself was just fine, nothing special.  I expected more of a wrap but it was served open-face and couldn't be held together so I had to use a knife and fork.  The accompanying fries were disappointing - golden brown on the outside but hard/under-fried inside.  

Bottom line: Crazy Jim's is lucky it pretty much has the monopoly of pre-concert eating/drinking within walking distance of the Dodge Theater.",2009-05-20 17:18:23

I understand rent is expensive in Bridgeland, but I ordered a egg/cheese sandwich on whole grain and it cost $8. That is without anything else...no fruit/coffee/etc. 

This is a local grab-and-go eatery where the entire concept is that it's fresh meals to go. If you're not able to cook a gourmet meal, you can pick it up here and then warm it up at home. The food by and large looks delicious, but you would pay the same prices at skipthedishes.ca and get larger portions. 

The shop also has some hot-meal areas where you can order a variety of dishes fresh off the grill. It's also possible to get a sandwich made to order. There is also a coffee bar if you don't want to the Starbucks that is a few doors down.

The staff are friendly enough and on the warmer days, there are chairs and tables outside to enjoy a glass of wine with your meal. (You can also order your food and eat at the restaurant.) Everything is definitely well-made and fresh, but I just didn't fid it to be remarkable to warrant the steep prices.

They also offer Hand Stretched Thin Crust Pizza and Crispy Extra Thin Pizza. On the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.

On Yelp I read about the long wait times so I planned to try them when they opened. At that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. We were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. 

We shared an entree sized Harvest Salad. The salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. This salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.

During our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. I found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.

Just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.

I received my individual stuffed plain pizza. The pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and I found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. Kinda like a rock. The crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. The very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. Although I found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that I found inedible. I don't know if the crust I received is typical of Giordano's or not. 

My husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. He said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. He did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the ""Other"" Chicago place uses.

I really liked the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the well trained servers I encountered.

I would never go back for the pizza I received.",2017-01-16 11:55:53

thats the flavour of this place.  they have everything that you need, and then a whole bunch of stuff thats unusual and might fall under the title of ""treats"" for most folks.  the range in many products will be from the simple to the ornate lets say so you do have a range from which to choose in each kind of food.

at the front entrance they have a dessert display with the types of premade (likely not there) cakes youd get for your birthday or if you were getting married or at a luxurious restaurant.  small and beautiful.

the meats look incredibly carnivorous.  its as delectable as the cakes.  the more an item looks like it can disappear into the guise of being exotic or beyond compare the more wild the price.  

as a foodie there are lots of things that id love to pick up, some that would be harder to find elsewhere and some that with a little initiative you could find somewhere else for much less.  as an example for both, i would re-introduce the avocado oil and cite the drop the packet in a pot of boiling water pre-made indian food that you can get for half the price in little india or an ethnic supermarket.

I've been here many times over a decade, but it's a different experience when I attend without my parents or family of 20!

I find the amount and quality of English speaking staff here is one of the better ones in the city, so it makes it really easy for anyone to come here and enjoy dim sum without bringing their translator friend.

$3 for small, medium, large dishes if you come before 11am which is pretty decent. The quality of food here is good-best, the amount per dish seems to be less i.e. 3 instead of 4 steamed dumplings or Chung fun looked like 2 long rolls/pieces cut into 4 servings vs standard 3 long pieces. 

We were seated on the ground level which is nice with the huge vaulted ceilings and long Windows, the basement had mahjong games going on at 10:30am! I was wondering were they still here from last night or is breakfast Mak Jong a thing for retirees?? LoL

Redeeming factor- a lady served us our shrimp Chung fun(steamed rice roll) and it had a pronounced short fiber of hair garnishing the dish. When I pointed to it out nicely to my server, she was genuinely surprised and took it back without me needing to ask. The manager also came to inquire what happened and we clarified we did want the dish just not with hair! It came back fresh and hot and did not look like they just reheated the same dish.

It's six bucks to get in which is reasonable and the concessions are cheap as well. You can get a decent amount of snacks for the same price of admission. Another positive is the friendly staff! They're all people from the neighborhood who take pride in their pool and rec center. 

The best part of this pool is the fact that they allow rafts. No other public pools in the area let you use them so it's this is a huge perk. While it's nice to float, the water is freezing!

Aside from the water, the pool is in okay condition. Nothing spectacular. The sidewalks were made with a gravel/stone-like concrete so it's hard on your feet and the bottom of the pool is a little cracked so you should watch your step.

Location/Environment:
Went there on a Sunday, surprisingly not too many people.  Street parking is available (but carpool would be best to avoid issues).  There's a lot of artwork inside the restaurant (I'm not too much into art, but they all look very nice).  We sat at the corner by the window, which was perfect since it was a group of 5.

Service:
Our waiter was fantastic - he was funny, friendly and really made the dinner enjoyable.  He recommended us a Portuguese white wine called Pinho Real.  It's very good - light, sweet and only exclusive to their restaurant.  The restaurant is a little bit upscale - so there were more staff available and serving you and they were all nice as well.

Food:
Appetizer - Goat Cheese, eggplant, portabella mushrooms, champagne vinaigrette
Surprisingly good.  I loved how you can distinctively taste all the flavours, and it doesn't clash with each other.  Note the goat cheese is a little strong for those who aren't into cheese that much.  But I really liked the mushroom - very soft and easy to eat. 

Main - Pan Seared Skate Fish on lemon coriander risotto
I'm not a fan of risotto - but it had skate fish, so I had to try.  The skate fish was grilled very nicely on the outside; it has a grilled chicken taste to it. The meat inside was perfect - soft, not dry, boneless. I really enjoyed it.  The risotto was not bad too.  It was a good combination with the fish.

Dessert - Molotof, flan of eggwhies, crÃ¨me anglaise
This is a Portuguese dessert, which is fluffy whipped egg whites.  It was not bad first time trying it.  There was a lot of honey/syrup around the molotof, which made it very sweet - a little too sweet for my tasting.

I was hesistant at first.  The menu looked like a solid deli but you never can tell, especially when stuff is  being prep'd on a truck.

I'm concerned by how cramped the table are in the play land. Towards the tables in the corner, you might have to squeeze in depending on the size of your bottom. The food still needs improvement, like the fries being fresh no matter when I order them. Also, why does the lobby seem cold, like the A/C is always on. 
One thing I do look forward to is seeing the cashiers, the ones in the black regular crew shirts. They are attentive to my children (my kids order their own food with gift cards). A manager once deleted one of their orders because both orders were the same, but only one was given their food. Thank you to the young boy who took their order, he saw that we were still waiting sand got their food.",2015-10-23 16:33:07

They don't call themselves Pizza and Mozzarella bar for nothing.  There is Mozzarella available on almost every dish.  They have a typical Italian fare, Panini's, Pizza, meatball sandwiches. The salads looked very good as well.  Let me start with the best part, The staff and service.  It was very good. I sat at the bar and ordered a Pelligrino while I waited for my lunch companion to arrive. Apparently someone had failed to chill Pelligrino the night before and they only had warm bottles.  They served it to me in a glass with ice but were extremely apologetic about it. Hey, I know stuff happens, I was more impressed with their genuine and sincere disappointment in the situation. The staff was extremely pleasant, helpful and courteous during my visit.  The owner, Jim came by and introduced himself.  I love it when they do that. 

The food was also very good.  We had a half pizza and Egg Plant sandwich. The Pizza we ordered included Prosciutto and it was excellent.  I love italian stlle pizza with a smoky and crisp crust.  This pizza was on par with Chris Bianco's pizza's. Maybe the cheese was just a little runny, but I am spitting hair's here.  The Egg Plant sub was also very good.  
The wine list was small list was small but carefully chosen. You can find a large enough variety of wine too satisfy everyone in the group from what I saw by quickly glancing over the wine list.  They also carried a beer that up until last week I had never tried. The Drifter Lager from Widmer Brothers brewery in Portland. I have since found it in retail store and bought myself some. Thanks Spasso for turning my onto a few beverage. 

All in all, it was a very nice afternoon. I wished I could have lingered a little while to enjoy some of the other offerings.  I guess I will have to go back soon to do that.",2011-01-10 04:44:27

I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. 

This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. 

Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! 

The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. 

My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). 

The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!",2011-03-21 23:51:59

They have an all you can eat menu that isn't really all you can eat. It's more of a set menu. It has a variety of small plates (soup and salad, sushi, sashimi, tempura, ginger chicken, terriyaki beef or salmon, terriyaki veggies, fried rice or udon, etc) for twenty something dollars. I can't remember exactly how much it is. It feeds two people with extras. The sushi isn't the best in terms of how it was rolled, but they stuff those things incredibly full of spicy salmon and stuff, so I wouldn't be surprised if they burst when they tried to cut them. I will most certainly let them off the hook for that. Side note though. They do allow you to share this menu, but the menu does only come with one soup and one salad (if I'm not mistaken), and if they bring you two of either one (usually the soup), it means you're probably not going to get the other one (usually the salad), so you might want to clarify which one you want. They didn't tell us once, and we thought they gave us an extra soup on the house. Turns out they had given us soup instead of salad without our consent.

The sushi is fresh. This place is Korean own, so they have some Korean menu items as well. I've had the bibimbap. It's decent. This restaurant was not made for large parties, but they can handle parties of about 10 comfortably, I think. Limited parking though.

And I'll second that comment about getting small dishes on the house. I believe they've given us banchan (lots of it when we brought a large party), small pieces of fish (the flesh on the bones they have after the cut off the rest), etc.",2015-04-15 21:07:58

Very knowledgable, not just with the brand, but with holistic health in general. She really taught me a lot about taking care of my skin and my body. But, she has actually left Pure and Simple to teach instead. 

But, so far, I went back for two facials after my first one and each time I go back, it leads to a disappointment. The last facial I had before New Years was probably the one facial that gets me debating whether or not to return. The aesthetician was not knowledgable of the products she was using on me and the massage was very gentle. Had super dry skin before my facial and left with red, blotchy skin. Not gentle with extractions and extracted a few acnes that were not ready to come out - ended up with a bigger acne the next few days.

Jenny is one of the main reasons we return to The Prime.  The other main reason is because The Prime makes incredible Chinese food.  Every dish is unique from sauces to vegetables to the protein.

The Wor Wonton Soup is amazing.  For you vegetarians, the Braised Bean Curd is excellent.  Select appetizers and main dishes from a comprehensinve menu.  The menu has chicken, duck, pork, beef, and fish.  I have had a few of the fish dishes and they are executed very well.  Everything on the menu is executed well.

Try the red chile sauce at your table.  It is such a good burn.

The Prime serves beer.  Try a Chinese beer or select a wine.  They do have Plum wine.  For a non alcoholic treat order the Thai Ice Tea.  It is sure to fix your sweet tooth craving.

For you health nuts, The Prime serves brown rice.

The decor of The Prime is very modern.  The walls have cool art work.  There are a couple of large collages on the walls that are fun to look at and the raised fish diaramas always catch my eye.

 I'll start with the pho, it was horrible.  I don't see how they can even get away with calling it that.  The so called tendon was actually huge fatty chunks of beef most people use for pot roasts.  They had no hoisen sauce, hot sauce or sprouts.  The noodles were super small and tasted funny.  I can't even be certain they were rice noodles.  Two bites in and I was done.

I found the coffee station but the machine was broken.  A little screen informed me only hot water was available.  That's okay, I was allowed to have two whole iced teas before the waiter pulled a dissapearing act.  

The dessert bar is the best one I have seen at a buffet.  Chocolate covered strawberries, fresh made baby doughnuts, hand scooped ice cream are just a few of the treats here.  I asked about the cotton candy but was told the machine was broken.  Not two minutes later the kids at the next table come bouncing over with their purple cotton candy on a stick.  I guess it was only ""broken"" for me.

For years, I've heard people singing the praises of Copper's food, but I could never convince myself that I really wanted to stop in for a bite.  Last night, the allure of 1000 bonus points on opentable.com and the excitement of being 1000 points closer to our $100 gift certificate spurring us on, Ginny and I decided to give Copper a try.  

For starters, I don't want a modern take on ethnic food.  I simply want to eat authentic (or as close to authentic as I can get without eating the excretory parts of an animal) ethnic food.  If I lived in India perhaps a modern take on Indian food would excite my palate.  I do not live in India, though.  I live in Charlotte.  Unfortunately, ethnic restaurants in smaller cities have to cater to American taste buds in order to stay in business, and I believe Copper has subscribed to that philosophy.  Nouveau Charlotteans do love anything described as ""modern,"" ""upscale,"" or ""urban,"" so Copper could serve Aunt Jemima pancakes smothered in masala and lure a crowd of identically dressed urban dwellers into their restaurant with the mere description of ""an upscale and modern twist on a traditional pancake.  3 pancakes:  $25.99.""  

Sorry for the tangent....  On to the review.

The naan was good.  The meat was overcooked.  The spices--the best part of Indian cooking--were not terribly bold.  Unfortunate.  The servers were attentive, professional and quick to offer a suggestion when asked about their favorite dish.  The food was overpriced for the quality.  The restaurant space is quite nice, and with quite a few overhauls to the menu I think that Copper could be nearly as fantastic as all the fantastic reviews.

I came for a 7:45pm dinner with a group of about 12. There was another group of the same size seated near us who seemed to receive better service in some areas. We started out ordering drinks and appetizers about 15 minute after being seated. Our drinks weren't delivered for 25 minutes, and the appetizers nearly 10 minutes after that. Beverages really should not take that long! We had requested our server a few times in between this time frame and he didn't appear to take our entree order until 8:45. We were missing one appetizer and had to continually remind him as well. The entrees finally arrived about 35 minutes later, and the missing appetizer after that. Kindly, they at least removed that appetizer from the bill. Receiving the bill was another long wait, but we were able to use the Yelp check-in of 10% off which we had to remind our server of twice. 

The saving grace was the food. I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken. This was a succulent boneless breast of chicken with a wing attached, served atop wilted spinach and creamy red quinoa. On top of all of this was a marsala mushroom sauce. The dish had a ton of flavor and the creamy red quinoa was really the star for me. The mushrooms and wilted spinach balanced out the creaminess of the other elements. I wanted to like this restaurant because we all enjoyed our food. But I honestly would not come back because we spent over 2 hours here, most of it waiting around.",2016-02-23 18:06:18

I enjoyed a strawberry banana cakepop that so amazingly sweet with a light moist fruitiness to it.  It was nicely glazed with purple buttercream icing that was just about to get to that slightly crispy outer shell.  

$3.00 is a bit pricey for a cake pop, but I enjoyed the 3 bites it took to finish it.  I want to get a colossal cupcake next time and they really are colossal!  I just wish they had more than 4 flavors to choose from when I went- maybe it was too busy?

Now that our days off are weekdays and our friends who have the same day off as us live in the SW, it was time to finally check something off my list that has been sitting there, patiently, for years. 

We were gonna order off the menu until we were told the two specialty sandwiches. There was a yellow curry chicken sandwich and a moroccan sandwich that had north african spices, goat cheese, red bellpepper, etc. Both sandwiches were great sounding so we chose those. I liked the moroccan a bit more, but only because Im a sucker for those flavors combos. The bread was nice, good balance of crusty and softer bready center. 

Got the ice tea of the day - green tea citrus gingko which was refreshing. I like places the brew fresh, and brew something a bit more unique that plain black. 

The service was really friendly - it was the owner of the place at the counter. He was super enthusiastic and caring of his place. They brought out our food outside and came to check on everyone outside which I didn't expect. It is always a nice touch for counter service places to still have some sort of service. 

I think the price to quality ratio was very good. It seems they use better products with an emphasis on natural, healthy choices and nice to have places not charge a arm to get fresh choices.

I can see why people like this as their casual lunch spot. I think there are other similar sandwich and coffee type cafes like these you can compare it to, and this I think this probably ranks top notch among them.

A stand-alone restaurant in a renovated house is a rarity here in Las Vegas - and I'd give this place two stars on that alone.

It's like you're eating at the home of an up-and-coming mobster or something.  Yeah, the place is a little worn and grubby - but I think that adds to, rather than detracts from, the experience.

Admittedly, I'm no connoisseur when it comes to Italian food - it doesn't even rank in my top 5 types of cuisine - so take my opinion for what it's worth. I like the food here.  The creamy garlic salad dressing is good - on top of a solid iceberg lettuce salad.  The Shrimp Parmigiana is tasty (isn't there supposedly a rule about cheese and shellfish?) and the Chicken Marsala fine but I still prefer Miceli's in my hometown of Hollywood.

I have heard good things about it and it is one of the only ""nice"" restaurants in the Northwest but overall I was struggling to really ""like it"". I ultimately gave it a three based upon the food as that is what I primarily consider, I would provide it a four based on decor and ambiance.

First off, I really like the wine shop and they had some good wines at decent prices. Also, the $10 corkage fee is attractive and I like that you can buy a wine right there. We sat out on the patio, this too I liked. There was live music, a saxophonist, a little loud but still nice. It was a small little alcove next to the water which provided an intimate feel. The service was prompt and pleasant as well. 

We had the steak tar-tare appetizer, this was tasty. Also, I had the French Onion soup. I love French Onion soup and this was a nice surprise, probably my favorite part of the meal, light sherry undertone and very rich. I ordered the Risotto with truffles. Risotto was too al dente for my taste and was under-seasoned. The risotto was $18. I shared this entry with my husband who ordered the Lobster Pot Pie. The pot pie was also disappointing; they would have been well served to have called it Lobster stew. There was a good amount of lobster in the ""pie"", but there should be especially in light of the hefty $40 price tag. But the flavor was lacking and it was not rich and creamy but more soupy. We had the Lobster Pot Pie at Michael Mina in SF and it was phenomenal for about the same price or possibly even less. And don't get me wrong I have no qualms with spending money on a great meal, I will gladly do so, but I still like to review each meal on it's own and by comparison with other restaurants at similar price points. 

Our other dinner companion had the duck breast. I tried a piece of his and it was very moist and had a good flavor. Overall, nice decor and food was good, but not good enough for me to come running back here when there are so many other places in LV to try and not quite sure why they made it into the 50 essential restaurant book.",2011-09-25 18:04:23

We came here for brunch around 11-12? and it was pretty packed. I think we waited for a good 30 minutes or so but in the end the wait was totally worth the wait. I was totally drooling when we were waiting to get seated because I was looking at the menu that just makes me wanna get everything. In the end I didn't get anything from the menu and got their special. 

I thought the decorations looked great and there was an outside view where you can see the pool and stuff. I really like the environment of the restaurant. I thought the weird part was the music that went along with the place...It just didn't fit well. 

The service was pretty good. I think the guy was on top of his guy in terms of explaining all the specials and he always seem to have a smile on his face. He refills our water every so often so in terms of service I thought he passed.

I only tried 3 things in the restaurant and that would be the Croque madame, Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron served with French fries, and my pork belly BLT. Yes I said it...P-O-R-K B-E-L-L-Y B-L-T....I don't know about you but my eyes sure lit up when I heard that was the special for the day. 

Croque Madame: What is there not to like about a fried egg on top of a toasted ham and cheese on brioche. It's sounds so simple but it's just simply delicious. The combination of such simple ingredients can bring out such a wonderful taste. If anything I think the fries that came along with the dish was the EH part. I don't know...I just keep finding the fries to be a bit salty to me.

Pork Belly BLT - Personally I loved my dish because it's so unique. When have you ever heard of a pork belly BLT. It just sounds so epic and delicious. I think the worst part of the dish is figuring out how to eat it. Since there poach egg on top of the whole dish, I couldn't even hand-held it and eat it. So I decided to cut it but at some point I would cut the poach egg which will let out the yolk out(not that i mind but it can get messy :p.) The combination of lettuce,tomato, poach egg and sliced up pork belly made it pretty darn amazing. I thought the pork belly was made well because there are restaurants that make the pork belly really dry and it makes the pork belly disgusting but I find it to be the right texture here so it went along well. :)

Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron served with French fries - This is what my friend got and I personally loved this dish. I think this was my favorite dish that if I ever come next time I think I'm gonna get this dish myself(not that Pork Belly BLT isn't good). You get so many mussels for only 25.50?! I mean come on that's already a big steal...I couldn't even count how many mussels were in that bowl of wonderfulness! The white wine sauce was simply amazing and when you can some of that sauce in that mussel and you can suck it out...Just AMAZING!!! I seriously recommend getting this dish because the mussels that they have is really fresh. The french fries that went along with it...I saw my friend dipped it in the white wine sauce and she kept doing it and i was like HMM let me try. Later on...I found myself super thirsty because I couldn't stop eating the french fries dipped in white wine sauce. I REALLY LOVE THIS DISH.

I would say it's something worth getting for brunch if you happen to be in vegas! :)",2011-08-26 19:14:04

I was in late near close and at the end of the night all the restaurant workers (all family?) sat down for a group meal themselves.  Kind of cool, but one suggestion...  I think this should be conducted after close or the server should probably not be a part of this meal because I felt like I had no one attending to my table at the end and I didn't want to interrupt the group meal.  Not a huge deal but others might get more upset.",2015-03-05 20:16:53

It was great to just being able to walk in and be seated, we appreciated that.

Everyone was friendly and smiling. We were excited to try. I ordered the Challah French Toast, it came with sausage,eggs, biscuits and cheese grits. I was confused why I got two starches, French Toast and a biscuit. 

Waitress forgot the syrup, and was MIA for a while so I ate it without. Was bummed on the Challah, tasted like regular French toast.

Or one of their made-from-scratch soups like the lentil, chili, or combine the two in one, add chicken or keep it vegetarian, topped with fresh cheddar or feta cheese. For an entrÃ©e their rolled pitas are lightly toasted and served warm and much more filling than you might think.

So I looked up local thai restaurants and found this place. It's tucked away in a small plaza,  next to a shoppers drug mart and a metro on Port Union and Lawson. At first I was hesitant because, they didn't ask how hot I wanted the food (usually a red light for pad thai), and when I goto to the place and it was empty. However, I just chalked that one up to it being 9pm on a Monday night and went ahead and grabbed my food (I wouldn't have bailed on the order at that point anyway, Douche-Move!). 

I have to say I was definitely impressed, I have had good Thai and horrible ketchup noodle crap before, and this was definitely good Thai food. The spring rolls were good, the vegetarian pad thai was good, they asked if I wanted it egg free, so I guess I could have gotten it more vegetarian if I really wanted it.

We decided to give this place another try after a few months. To start we ordered the garlic fries which has fresh crushed garlic and Cajun seasoning. We  ordered the fries well-done extra crispy and they came out soggy I wasn't a fan.  We  ordered the fish tacos which was yellowtail sashimi, Avocado, cilantro, and cherry tomatoes. The tacos were delicious we were  very happy they had a unique wonton taco shell which really made the dish no complaints. Next we ordered the belly buns which was braised pork belly, Cilantro, and peanuts with a typical bun. I was very disappointed with them they need a lot of work, they are average at best. Next we tried the Oxtail  Fried Rice which had Shredded Oxtail meat, red onion, soy sauce and a fried egg. Another disappointment they said it was one of their more popular dishes but failed to deliver amongst our table. Lastly we tried the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio which consists of beef carpaccio, citrus soy, sesame oil, truffle oil, white onions, basil and peanuts. This was very good, nothing that I would completely rave  about but very good. No complaints I would order it and the tacos again for sure.
Pros: Good food, cool atmosphere, good crowd and they're open late.
Cons: although some of the dishes are good the rest of menu definitely needs some work. They really could be doing better. The staff seemed a little distracted with each other talking and on their phones at times and not really paying attention to a lot of the tables my friends and I had to wait a few times for water and drinks. After ordering appetizers our waiter disappeared for at least 15 minutes before he came back to take our entrÃ©e order. Lastly no wifi this is always a bother considering it's 2017 and every business should offer it to their patrons.

My friend and I ordered the chicken tikka masala (mild), the fish curry (medium), and the regular naan. Our entrees came with a side of rice and a complementary flatbread appetizer served with tamarind sauce and two types of chutney (onion and cilantro). While the portions are small, the food is very filling - probably on account of all the carbs! :P

As for our dishes, the chicken was a little tough, but otherwise well-seasoned. I really enjoyed the creamy tomato base, and I was glad that I ordered it mild instead of medium because the medium fish curry was REALLY spicy. I was a huge fan of the battered catfish cooked in a garlic/ginger sauce, but I could only take so much heat. :( 

Service was impeccable. Our water glasses were always filled quickly and plates were cleared off the table as soon as we were done with them. The staff continually circulated by to see how we were enjoying the meal and seemed genuinely interested in any feedback we had about our dining experience.

The first time, she got a rash all over her neck (even after being washed down at home afterwards). This last time we went (about 2 weeks ago) she started throwing up in the lake. Then, I noticed a small dog (possibly a Jack Russell mix was doing the same thing) and then my friend's dog (a lab mix) was throwing up as well. Time to leave, right? I took my dog home and gave her a bath (but the same rash still returned on her neck). 

A few hours later, I get a call from my friend. She had to take her dog to the vet emergently because she wouldn't drink any water, could barely get up, and was breathing very heavily after being sick at the park. The vet said that it appears to be some sort of virus that she probably caught in the water. The dog was rehydrated and given some antibiotics and perked up within a few days, but still... that's scary. We will no longer be going to this dog park. It's worth the drive to Tempe's dog parks to keep my dog safe and healthy.",2010-10-07 03:30:28

I really liked the design of the space, except for the depth of the tables at the booth - it put me noticeably too far away from the person across from me. 

The drink menu sounds great, the Pick Me included. I didn't like it however. It tasted strong and heavy. The waitress brought me extra lemonade to try and lighten it up, but when that didn't do the trick she happily took it off the bill. Next I tried the Frescas and was much more pleased with the light, fresh flavors of watermelon, mint and lemon. 

The waitress did a great job giving an overview of the menu. You could tell she had tried and seen all the dishes. The only thing on the menu I was unfamiliar with was Robata, apparently a style of cooking. I tried a pork skewer off the Robata menu. I found the thin strip of pork cooked to what I would consider well done, but it was still flavorful. See my photo of this - you get 1 piece of meat on a skewer. So you need to order perhaps 3 or 4 of these to make a traditional appetizer up like chicken satay. 

This restaurant is great for ordering a bunch of apps/sides and I think that is all I would do next time. As far as that category of food goes I also tried the Indian hummus. The chickpeas were really good set in the center of the hummus and the overall flavor was a bit sweet. The bread (all breads are made in house) was out of this world! Soft. Full of aroma. Delicious.

For my main I tried the Stuffed Pita Sandwich, but opted to forgo the bread and get it as a rice bowl. The waitress said you get more food in the bowl version. This certainly appeared true as my portion was large. I didn't eat all the rice, but enjoyed skimming a bit of it up with each bite. The mini falafel were excellent. The rest of the ingredients had great flavor and were very fresh tasting. 

With the sandwiches come a choice of either Togarashi Fries or Kale Slaw. The slaw is a bit spicy, but was my preference over the fries. The fries were good, but were not overly different than regular fries in my opinion. 

Overall a nice new addition to the Red and Moxie family and I'll certainly be back to try some more cocktails, Robata and apps.",2016-08-04 19:33:54

There are to-go pre-made roll containers, but that is if you are in a hurry. 

The roll I had was very, very good quality. The rice was right, and all the ingredients were really fresh and plentiful. The portion looks small, but I was really full after that I even delayed eating my dinner (I eat a lot. Like, I never order salads when I go out). 

I thought the price was very reasonable (rolls start from $7.50 and up), and this is actually the best quick-service sushi joint experience I had in the downtown core. By quick-service,  I mean don't bring your girlfriend for a special treat (don't do it, bro) or a visiting aunt from out of town. The feel and set up is very much like a bubble tea cafe. It is more of a lunch place, especially compared to the dinner options on the street.

The cashiers are also semi-servers and they were very professional and well-trained; they will bring the roll to you when it is done in a disposable plastic container, with chopstick and soy sauce (you get to choose low-sodium or regular).

Decor: 4
Service: 5
Food: 4.5

It's located inside Caesars and it's pretty hard to miss since the sign is so big. The decor is cute, a little outdoorsy and casual. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. He let us know which were more popular and wasn't afraid to tell us which items he didn't like either. Usually, servers just try to sell everything to you so I like that he was honest with us.

We decided to use their fixed menu and chose items off that list. For appetizers we ordered something Blue Pancake and Salmon & Tuna tartar. Personally, I liked the tar tar better than the pancake but my bf loved the pancake more than the tartar. The tartar itself is great but the chips that come with it are someewhat of a fail lol. For entrees we ordered sea scallops and their salmon entree. Both were DELICIOUS. The salmon was cooked realllllly well and the scallops came with avacado, chips, etc. Basically, both were the highlights of the meal, hands down. Lastly, we shared the Vanilla Profiteroles for dessert. I don't know what profiteroles are but it basically looks like a fancy icecream-filled puff to me.

Not sure if it was because we went at 8:30 on a Sunday, or if GHT us falling off it's game, but I was terribly disappointed.

Took friends from out of town and we were seated at a window table in the cool little loft nook - intimate with a great view if the street. Great start.

After the server provided the explanation of Firsts, Seconds, Thirds and Halves - we ordered what we thought was a good combination of appropriately sized choices. We got no insight from him to assist us in our choices, only a listing of what was depleted and the replacement items. Since he'd asked if this was our first visit - I was surprised he provided no insights into the choices, sourcing, etc.- something that has been a constant at other eateries that pride themselves on their sustainable menu.

Devils on Horseback had great flavor, but arrived at the table lukewarm at best - almost starting to chill - which took away from a great combination of flavors. The Animal Fries were HUGE and should be shared or ordered as a meal themselves - but were listed as a Half on the menu - which is suggested as a Side. Sadly, our table of four also got an order of the regular Gravy Fries - to share and one  diner's meal also came with fries ... but, being the only person who was aware of the portion sizes, accompaniments, etc. - our server did not bring this overabundance of frites to our attention - so while they were great, the portions were way too big to allow us to really enjoy our Third courses. I would have expected the server to just mention it - the beauty of great service is that the server - through his knowledge - guides you around these possible pitfalls.

The Gravy Fries were also served close to lukewarm ... The fries at the bottom were hot, but the top third had cooled significantly before it arrived at our table. Other choices - Ohio City Pasta and Ceasar were judged to be good - but not great.

The Chicken Fried Lamb did not arrive at the table hot. The tastes were great - with the sharply acid slaw providing a superb accent for the rich lamb and savory gravy and mash. The Steak was ordered medium rare and arrived exceptionally rare -- almost just a sear on the meat. The diner did not send it back, but was clearly not overwhelmed by the dish (took 2/3 home - including the 'round 3' of fries). The Burger was judged OK - but not stellar. 

Overall - we were disappointed with the service and the food - after hearing so many raves about both. If the food had arrived at the table hot, it might have helped tremendously, but we'll never know. I'm sorry that this was our friends' only impression of an outstanding restaurant in Cleveland -- because GHT did not measure up to the buzz. We'll continue trying new places, but won't be back to GHT with so many other places getting everything right.",2011-09-26 14:03:12

We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary.

The first time I ordered from them was an interesting experience. I ordered it as I left work so I could pick it up before traveling out of town, and the food was actually listed as ""ready"" on my app within a couple minutes, no exaggeration. It was ridiculously speedy. When I finally got there and picked up my food I was able to enjoy my order of spicy tuna and their Bento Box A while on the road. On the plus side my order had LOTS of food - way more than I expected! - but admittedly it was not all what I expected it to be, i.e. a few extra ingredients and items showed up in the bento box that I didn't expect. A little clarification on their ordering menu could fix that, though. The food was of mixed quality as well - some rolls were absolutely delicious, others were pretty ""meh."" I guess the ingredients just weren't evenly distributed when things were made that time around?

The second time I ordered from them months later was all around much better. I ordered their DELICIOUS aloha rolls and a cup of soup, and I devoured that meal before my evening meetings with gusto. Because mmmmm, was it good! No complaints this time around! Now after that I'm dying to try even more of their special sushi rolls.

Oh, and I got a better look at the inside of this place the last time I picked up dinner. The interior of Thai Hana is cute, bright, and colorful - I'd definitely consider eating here sometime. And yes, the other dishes I saw at peoples' tables here were as enormous as the first time I'd ordered a bento box.

I spoke with the training manager who just assigned me to another trainer who flaked out.  Then I spoke with the gym manager who awkwardly pulled me into a meeting to re-explain the situation (for the 3rd time) while arguing with me about being 5 minutes late to my training appointment (the one time THEY were available for me as agreed).   Any decent training I did with them was on the fly--in the moment--due to one of their trainers flaking out on me.  Nothing was gained by trying to work this out with the gym manager.  I left angry and upset.  I came home and wrote to the corporate headquarters via their online ""cancellation"" service.  Didn't hear anything back.  Almost a week later, I called my cc company to block all charges coming from them.  They tried to help me call the gym using the number they had on file.  The lady was horrible and only wanted me to understand the ""I had signed a contractual agreement"".  This may be true, but so did they.  They have in no way upheld their end of the agreement to provide training services as any rationale person would expect.  I cannot imagine treating ANY customer this way and maintain a successful business.  I'm moments away from joining LA Fitness.",2015-05-26 18:58:03

Yesterday at the recommendation of an employee I got the Doc's sandwich - I can't remember the exact name and it's not listed online, but she was so right.  It's mesquite smoked turkey, spicy aioli, peporoncini, onions, on this outstanding pretzel bread, toasted. Just the right amount of zing to it, though it had a bit more aioli than I would have cared for. It's slightly pricey at 8.95, though it comes with a (small) side of fruit. The first time there I got the Smokey Joe (mesquite smoked turkey breast, smoked gouda, lettuce, onion, tomato & cilantro with garlic aioli - w/o bacon for me) - also very good.  Next time I go I'll have to try the coffee, and they do have a surprisingly large selection of bottled beer.

I really like what the owners did with the old Willow House, which I used to go to back in the day. When I first went to Hob Nobs I was kind of sad to see the old place change, but they did such a great job with the renovation that it's hard to complain. 

As others have noted, the parking is very tight; I've gotten lucky, but I'm pretty sure there's a sign that says you can park across the street.

(By the way, for some reason Yelp has separate listings for ""Hob Nobs"" and ""Hob Nobs Coffee House. Not sure why.)",2011-08-26 17:39:57

So I made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the Mastro's website. What I didn't know was that I had somehow clicked on the Chicago location. Luckily I was walking around the Crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. They were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) 

The service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. Loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. 

The food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi and the Signature Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. We had the bone-in Filet which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared Chilean Sea Bass which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. 

Dessert was over the top .. we had three .. Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake, 
the Cherry Crisp, and the Profiteroles. The first two were topped with Vanilla Bean Gelato. Both were to die for. I had read lots about the Warm Butter Cake and it was everything I had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly I also loved the Cherry Crisp .. I am not huge on Cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the Crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the Gelato and fruitiness of the dish. It's something I would definitely order again! 

My only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the Beef Carpaccio appetizer. Mom and I each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. Being in the service industry myself, I would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the Carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. 

All in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.",2013-02-22 04:25:39

Ever since my wife was diagnosed with a blood disorder and later non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we have had to make several trips to the pharmacy a week.  This occurred over about a 16 month period.  Ken was beyond fantastic during all of these trips, as was the additional staff at the pharmacy.  They were sympathetic, friendly, and worked very quickly.

We usually order kebab - chicken for my husband, and kafta or chicken for me.  But tonight we decided to shake things up, and the coupon did us in.  There was one from one of the mailers offering two dinners for $14.95.  Kebabs wasn't one of the choices, but Chicken Shawarma was.  How different could it be from Chicken Kebab, which we've always liked???

Step 1:  Call to order for take-out.  Kid on the other end: ""I'm not sure we have enough rice left for two dinners.""  It's 8:15; they close, I think, at 10.  Puts me on hold for quite a while.  Finally:  ""Yes, we do.""  So I order them, with one vinaigrette and one creamy for the salad dressings.  Five minutes and it'll be ready.  No prob, we live close by.

Hubby's sick, so I pick up the food.  Back home, I open my container to see the usual yellow rice, pickled cabbage and turnips, chopped raw red onion, the usual hard, dried-out pita, and a whole mess of dried and shriveled chicken pieces.  I taste one of them;  first I choked on the dryness, then my mouth shriveled from the salt - so much of it that two pieces and my lips were stinging as if I were doing a dead man's float in the Dead Sea.  It was completely inedible.

It was when I noticed that the salads - fresh romaine, two slices of cuke, and one lonely grape tomato - came with not one, but two vinaigrettes.  No creamy for me.  I was then completely pissed and called the restaurant.  Got the same kid who'd taken my order, and asked to speak with the manager.

I was put on hold twice - the second time for a verrrryyyy long time.  How big is this tiny place that he can't find the manager??  Finally the clerk gets back on to tell me that the manager isn't there, and he doesn't have the authority to issue any refunds.  But the manager will call me later this evening, if not, then tomorrow.  He didn't call tonight, so I'm waiting until late tomorrow afternoon to post this review.  I suspect that I will have waited for nothing.

Well, I was right to wait.  I never heard from Sultan's Grill.  I had planned to give this meal two stars, because I do like the chopped veggies and the salad (when I have the dressing I ordered).  But I believe that a food business shouldn't be in the business of selling inedible food, and if they do, they have a duty to respond to complaints.  I'm not even asking for a free meal, just an acknowledgment that they dropped the ball.  A business that does not do this doesn't deserve any stars, so I've revised my rating downward.",2011-02-14 07:25:47

We were greeted by a hostess at the front, and were asked if we wanted a table or booth. The restaurant itself is bigger on the inside, than what the exterior looks like. It's both clean and new, and that's the bonus of eating somewhere that's just opened.
We ordered everything from burger's to breakfast, and everything tasted just fine. I had breakfast, which consisted of two eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and toast. You can choose what type of toast, how you want your eggs, and sausage, bacon, or ham. This was just $7.99. My wife had crepes with yogurt and fruit, and for an extra $1.50 or so you can get eggs and ham with your order. Also we ordered strawberry waffles, which were good and my older boy ordered a burger. The burger he said was good, which I take with a grain of salt because every new burger he tries he says tastes good. It was accompanied by large deep fried onion rings, which were tasty, but greasy.
The waitress was very polite and attentive. The only small complaint that I have is the food took a little long getting to our table. I thought was odd, because the restaurant itself wasn't very busy at the time.
I will definitely be back to IHOP down the road for breakfast,lunch, or dinner anytime of the day.",2013-03-19 16:26:30

Came here on Mothers day weekend. Very excited to try this place as I had heard many good things. The wait to get in was very quick. It was packed but not too packed. It was still early enough where it wasn't that jammed. 

ANYWAYS. We ordered our food and no flipping joke we waited 55 minutes until we decided to leave our table without getting our food. I KNOW it was 55 minutes exactly because of a phone call I made. We were checked on twice before we left. We tried to find someone to tell them we were leaving and STILL couldn't find anyone. 

I was really bummed and really annoyed. I'll probably give this place a second chance to actually try the food. I understand it was Mothers Day. I really do but that's unacceptable to wait an hour for two people who ordered an omelet and french toast. Grrr",2016-05-20 03:25:40

I ended up drinking a few four peaks Kilt lifters before I decided on what I wanted and maybe the overdose of carbs led me to the santa fe type chicken salad that was great. The chicken was moist and blackened with the right amount of spice and the lettuce and toppings were super fresh. After dinner I tried a few new 4 peaks creations and hopped on the nearest pool table for some after dinner fun with the brew masters. The environment was always nice, music at the right level and plenty to watch on tv including my favorite ( UFC ). When I made it back to the table there were a plethora of desserts and I could not resist trying them and on the real I am so glad I did. The brownie with vanilla bean and coffee ice cream was to die for and also the brownie cake with peanut butter. Just super mouth watering sugar-tastic goodness all around.

Luckily, I can count on Cactus Grill when I want a fast lunch that is less corporate than a McBurger.

The quality of the food is near mediocre; some ingredients really shine, but others somehow always disappoint.  Many of the meats (chicken, steak) are chewy and dry, though they're left to soak in their juices before service (doesn't help, unfortunately).  For my meat option, I usually stick with the fish, which is deep-fried in a panko-like batter.  The fish dishes also usually come with a drizzle of creamy chipotle sauce, yum.

Recently I bought a burrito with cilantro-lime rice and black beans.  The rice is an unmistakable (but poor) imitation of the rice from Chipotle, with cilantro that is never mixed in evenly.  When I bit into the beans, I realized they were still...undercooked?  I was pretty surprised by this discovery as most places use pre-made, canned beans rather than beans cooked in-store...so compliments to homemade beans, but disappointment at undercooked beans.

Despite my criticisms, I still return to Cactus Grill every other week to pick up food.  It's not luxury, but I don't expect too much from lunch on a weekday.",2010-10-06 19:50:27

So since I haven't gotten any of those classic flavours in soooo long, I was incredibly excited to try this restaurant. Luckily this place did not disappoint, and I definitely will be returning. In terms of the positives, I would pretty much agree with everyone about their dumpling quality, and the vegetarian one (with the egg) is truly the bomb. The dumpling skin is so thin(without breaking) that you can easily see the good stuff on the inside, and all my dumplings arrived at the perfect temperature (not cold but not scathing hot)!! In addition, my grandmother was also acclaimed for her hot and sour soup, and according to my parents, the restaurant did a wonderful job with the soup, on par with grandma! (The fact that the big ass bowl of soup is only 4.99 doesn't hurt either.)

Aside from the dumplings, I was also excited for the potstickers, another grandma classic. Now I must say that having not had potstickers in foreverrrr I was incredibly excited to order this. However I was left slightly disappointed because the outer skin was not pan fried to the perfect point of crispiness. However I won't fault them too much for this, since other tables' potstickers seem to look fine, so my table might've just been unlucky.

As for the green onion pancake, it was actually kind of disappointing and I am surprised by all the hype about it. From what I noticed in my plate (and everyone's around me) there was a lack of green onion, which kind of defeats the purpose of a green onion pancake in my opinion. Going with the negatives, we also ordered a plate of fried noodles, which had a great noodle texture but was VERY greasy, and for some reason the veggies in it were kind of bitter. But I didn't really hold the noodles against them since I realize it's not their specialty.

Finally I was excited to try their dessert with the sweet potato dipped in honey, then put into cold water so the honey will form a candy coating around the sweet potato. I don't think I will be ordering this again, since they neglected to provide us with ice water, which meant the honey wasn't cold enough to become a coating and instead washed off in the water. The dessert was a great disappointment, and being the most expensive item (6.99) we ordered, it was a bad note to end the meal with.

Overall, I believe that this was a great experience if you know what to order. I feel like the items that you can find in any Northern Chinese home is done very well in this restaurant, where as the other items (more restauranty as opposed to homey) are a bit lack luster in my opinion. I'm glad I've discovered this place, and can satisfy my northern chinese cravings happily now!",2011-04-25 00:23:07

They brew their own beer here so you can guzzle down some Charlotte made brews while eating good food instead of your typical bar food.

My go-to brunch items:
- Shrimp N Grits: My favorite in Charlotte, hands down. This dish is perfectly savory and spicy, with NC shrimp, chorizo, okra, peppers, Anson Mills grits, scallions, and creole sauce. It's got a kick that doesn't leave it bland and boring like some other places. 
- Chicken and Biscuit: if you're hungry, this massive breakfast sandwich is sure to fill you up! It's a scratch made biscuit with scrambled eggs, fried chicken, and peppercorn-chive gravy poured on top.
- Buckwheat and Quail: this dish is a popular one! These wonderful buckwheat johnncakes are topped with flash fried Georgia quail and whipped butter, with a smearing of house made blueberry syrup. I love the flavor combination with the quail and blueberries.

My seasonal drink: a creation they make in the winter time -- Cottonheaded Ninnymuggins, which is whiskey, coffee, and house made peppermint syrup topped with marshmallows... to DIE for!

The atmosphere here is really cool! You can sit at the bar and enjoy a short visit, or stay longer at a high top to get some work done or in a booth/at a real table to really indulge.

FQQ1PuLoTxFwyIlbVG0-wQ,ufcFOz7hafmAlbf8zRTefg,CvonRhKDJaH155xhtpz_iw,3,0,0,0,"Decent laid-back atmosphere with a nice menu selection. Enjoyed the casual brewery-esque deco & the spacious, open layout where it did not feel too crowded and there was decent space between tables/parties. Tv screens mounted frequently throughout & with non-neck-straining views if one is interested in whatever viewing attraction is displayed (sports). Complaint: music level. Too loud to easily hear or carry on a conversation. Had to literally speak an octave higher (slightly shout) to converse with someone less than 3 feet away. Turn it down a notch so one can hear their company, not to mention the staff! 

I don't enjoy beer. But my friend really enjoyed one of the house brews on special. Seems the beer is what brings people back, because the food was filling enough, at best. Somewhat unique- but nothing I would intentionally be eager to return for. 

After learning most everything on the menu including pickles means SWEET pickles (I don't mind them- but many do), that narrowed selection down for my friend, who really wanted the fish & chips. Their house made tartar is sweet- sorry, but even I cannot get on board with that. A TRUE tartar contains dill. So he went with the salmon filet on a bed of some sort of emphasized rice pilaf. I think we got stuck on our waitress asking ""how did you want that cooked?"" ...Uhm- it is FISH!!! What do you mean, HOW?! We were both miffed & managed to say, ""please make sure it is done- as in cooked."" Fish is NOT steak!!! You go to a SUSHI restaurant for ""rare"" fish! 

Needless to say- the plate came out & it was a portion less than what you'd receive paying $50+ a plate at a 5 star establishment for ""gourmet""... the filet was less than 4oz on a 1/4 cup amount of rice. Friend said the rice had 0 flavor. The 5 sprigs of ""steamed"" asparagus was like chewing on wood (I heard the crunch over the loud music) & the salmon was about the best part- but only the crust contained flavor while the rest flaked pretty bland. And this was ""worth"" $17. 

We had high hopes in the unique 'Brussels & Bacon' pizza I ordered. I wanted the fish tacos- but they only are served as an appetizer. Was not going to pay $12 for that then have to fork out an extra $2-3 for a side. Make it a meal. People who want tacos want more than a ""bite"". And I'm from Alaska- so don't pass it off with price as 'Alaskan Cod' when we know cod is bottom of the barrel, even in Alaska, where salmon & halibut are the true picks. Nothing about cod makes it more special, and Alaska is offended you use it's name to price gouge mediocre fish we don't even claim to fame. 

The pizza did not disappoint. Generous amount of Brussels. But the bacon was pretty weak. Corn was of plenty- I love corn- but paid for bacon on the pizza, not cheap corn as a filler. Crust was on par & pretty much made it, as overall, the flavor was a bit bland. But, that is what happens when you skimp on the salted bacon that is supposed to round out the dish & flavor. 

I passed on desert- but had a bite of the creme brÃ»lÃ©e my friend ordered. The waitress, while she was attentive & tried very hard- could not remember which version of the desert was on the menu. We were told it was supposed to be strawberry. Thought it tasted funny & was rather brown... to find out it was actually some rendition of a chocolate almond or something along the lines of what tasted ""burnt"", in my opinion. I passed after one bite. Friend was not too thrilled but ate it. Waitress apologized- but I guess it was a little disappointing not being provided the correct menu when choosing & spending was not the greatest way to end the experience. 

I would give it a second chance. There are other items/beverages I would like to try that have piqued my interest. And I really did enjoy the atmosphere & close location- seems like there is more potential to be discovered. And I will add- I sincerely appreciate a place that offers samples of their beers before having to order & not know! Excellent in offering samples of their brews- and they also seem to have excellent knowledge. I found it pretty cool to see a peek inside the brewery in the back upon entering/exiting on the side of the building where there are glass windows to the brew room.",2018-04-04 06:51:13

Otherwise, on our other visits, we've been greeted right away. We always sit in the bar which is open seating. 

We usually order one of the burgers with bottomless fries and my favorite, the Ensenada Platter. The service has always been good. The food fresh and hot.

The only negative here for me is the closeness of tables in the bar. If it's fairly full, you're almost elbow-to-elbow and you feel like you have to manuever sideways to get to your table.

The service is friendly, the place is clean, and even the other patrons were pleasant to be around. We ordered the 'duck' with pineapple, and the classic orange 'chicken'. I put quotes cause I don't really know what you'd call the imitation version of that, but it was just that and it was amazing. 
Maybe it had been a long time since either of us ate meat, but when my friend first tried her dish, she stopped and looked at it weird, cause she thought it was real meat.

So now I've included Tokyo Grill on my list of Japanese go-to places if I need food to soothe my ruffled soul :-)
The look of the interior doesn't do any justice for the atmosphere that the staff gave off. And oh my god! The place is operated by Japanese folks and you're getting the familiar ""Irashaimase"" type experience that you see on youtube clips; this was noticeable when I went in and the girl was going over the menu with a customer who was practicing his conversational-level Japanese.That factor alone was enough to convince me plant myself at a table have give the food a try.

I didn't want to splurge much so I just ordered the Chicken Tonkatsu dinner which comes with rice, miso soup and the typical simple salad. The chicken obviously flattened with a mallet, was tender and flavorful even when not dipped in the pool of tonkatsu sauce. And the panko coating was crispy. And the miso soup was just too soothing.

The downside was perhaps the worlds worst DJ, major ADD, songs played for 1 minute and switched - not crossfaded - and blaring (to be fair I think it was some kind of game I came on the end of).

But the tacos are average at best, and no better than what you could get your local Chili's or other commercialized Mexican joint (yes, I am aware that this is Latin American--not Mexican--food).  The biggest problem that I have is with the tortilla shell.  While most people like to fixate on the protein and the toppings (similar with sushi), it's the backbone of the dish (i.e. tortilla shell and sushi rice) that is most important. And, it is clear that the tortilla shells simply came from a bag from some commercial plant--bland, chewy, gummy, and sad. Once you've had a real, homemade tortilla shell, there is no going back. I expected better from a place that has ""tacos"" in its name.

Moving on the toppings, which I can only assume was meant to be the star of the show. We tried 7 varieties: BBQ Pork, Rio Style Chicken, Chipotle Mushroom, Chicken Tinga, Roasted Pork Al Pastor, Chorizo & Potato, and Lamb Barbacoa. Some things I noted: the pork had been cooked to death with inadequate seasoning (lathering on sauce is not a remedy as I'm sure we all know from a pot roast blunder or two); the slaw on the al pastor was extremely wet and I had a mushy, wet taco in my hands by the time I got to it; it was unclear whether the slaw on the al pastor or lime crema on the lamb barbacoa had been tasted by anyone and adjusted for seasoning before it was served because the sour element was overwhelming and not balanced whatsover.  

We also had the chicken empanadas as an appetizer. First of all, they were not empanadas--the flaky half-moon pastries that we're all used too. The waitress was spot on with her description:  they tasted and had the consistency of essentially pizza rolls.  So if you like pizza rolls, I guess they are fine.

Finally, the hostess was terrible.  I approached her to request a table for 2 on a Sunday around 2:30 P.M.  We then sat down at the high-top bar tables (where other people waiting for a seat were also sitting) at the spot closest to her and literally right in front of her.  We watched 4 other parties who had arrived after us be seated before we asked what was going on.  Turns out that she had crossed our names off the list because she thought we had gone to the bar.  No apology, just a blank stare.

I didn't try any of the drinks and don't intend to. $8 for a Dark n' Stormy is amusing; that's halfway to an entire bottle of Gosling's rum, and then I could have endless Darn n' Stormys for a month.

Authentic is definitely not the name of the game.

It had a very modern feel to it with all the dark and white furniture. Everything had a very minimalistic touch to it and I find that great because it puts all the attention on the food and not the surrounding. The only drawback of this place was the size. I found the space very tight, tables were almost edge to edge and the serving counter ventured off too far into the walk space. It's one thing to maximize work space, but obstructing walkways make it a hazard.

As for the food, I thought it was pretty good. We ordered the Japanese style popcorn chicken, mango roll surpreme and Oreo coffee milkshake. Chicken was good, but nothing I haven't had before. I think it's pretty similar to Cha Me Cha, but that doesn't mean it was bad. It came smokin' hot and the chicken was juicy and tender. The mango surpreme was great as well, but just not my thing since sweets and I aren't best friends. However, drinks I don't mind, which is why I ordered the Oreo coffee milkshake. All I could say was, ""DAMN!"" That was probably the BEST shake I've ever had in my short existance of life. Then again I don't drink much sweets either, but this drink is a close second to water and coffee  (.. it was coffee Lol). The shake was thick and in a good amount because it was just so heavy. I was thoroughly full by the last sip, but I had to finish the chicken too. There's always room for meat!

Overall a good place to hang out, but come in a small group. The lack of space made me think twice about giving this 4 stars, so if safety is an issue, visit the First Markham Place location. Otherwise, try to sit close to the door where there's a little more room. 3",2017-02-09 15:44:27

Also, everyone gets free soft serve. Its pretty good.

My mother and I have been going here for years, as long as they have been open. The last couple years this place has been going down hill. The price of the food has been slowly going up and the quality has been going down. When I pay $20 for dinner with a cup of soup that's way the hell to much for a glorified Denny's. My mom and I went here for dinner last night and the place was completely empty. We ordered and waited for our food. I always have the corn chowder because it's usually very good. Last night however it was way to thick and tasteless. I tried salting it but it did nothing. Then the waiter brought our dinner and right when he sat my seafood pasta down I knew something was wrong with it. I could smell a strong pungent odor that was not what it should smell like. The waiter walked away and I took a good whiff. It smelled like rotten urine. I am not exaggerating. This smelled BAD! They had also forgotten to put on the skewer of shrimp that I paid for. I called over another waiter to have him smell it and he said it smelled just fine. He then asked me if I wanted them to make another one so I agreed. He took my dish and went into the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back out with my dish and sat it down. It was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time. The scallops were burnt and the pasta was also burned around the outside of the dish. I tried to eat it but it was disgusting. The sauce was way to thick and the pasta was extremely sticky. It tasted horrible! I had one fork full and that was it. I pushed it aside and didn't eat anymore. The waiter came over later and didn't say a thing about the fact that I didn't eat my dinner. Not one sorry, not one can I get you anything else, no manager coming out to try and fix the situation.....nothing! This place has gone to shit. I will never be back. This used to be one of my favorite places but that's no longer the case. Do yourself a favor and just stay away.",2010-11-23 17:42:05

SAFETY FIRST - When you enter, you and your child are stamped the same number on your hand. And the number is checked before you exit so you can not walk away with someone else's kid! Love the idea. 

There are attendants constantly walking around and monitoring the kids. 

FUN FOR PARENTS - The waiting lounge for parents has complimentary tea and coffee, awesome massage chairs, elliptical machine and there is a walking track with weights!

PLAY AREA - The actual play area has a wide selection of activities to keep kids of all ages entertained. Including a toddler area for below 3 year olds, arts and crafts station and a nail painting station. 

Remember to bring socks for yourself and your kids.

We were given drink menus and they have a good selection of drinks. Also, different deals at certain times too.

The platter is huge! Too much for 2 people but filling indeed. I love their fries and their creamy dill sauce! It looks different and tastes even better!

If you are keen on an early dinner, and tight in the budget department, this can make for a excellent/thrifty start to any evening or date.

They have a happy hour menu which features a selection of more stripped-down offerings of some of their standard pizzas, each one for only $5. FIVE. BUCKS. That's the cost of a cardboard disc with melted Ken & Barbie dolls from Little Caesar's, for cryin' out loud! 
It is a KILLER deal considering the deliciousness of their pizza. Their website boasts, ""the best pizza crust in the city,"" and I have to admit, it is quite good. Thin, but not to thin; chewy, but not too chewy; delightfully greasy, but not too greasy.

They also offer drink specials like a $5, 5 oz. Valpolicella. Not bad.

The interior is tastefully decorated, nice and cozy.

The service is very friendly. Even accommodating to the cabalone that wanders in in 15 minutes before 5:00 hoping to still catch happy hour. Just be sure to tip a little extra if you're getting a good deal during happy hour.

We also ordered the 12"" thin crust Wood Fired Yukon Gold + egg pizza to try something new.  It was good but I'd like it better if the whole thing had egg on it instead of just the center.   Kind of reminded us of breakfast.  Glad we tried it but will probably go back to our favorite Pavone Pepperoni again next time.

Walking in to Wag N' Wash you are transported to a place where pets are the number one priority.  The owners recognize you and tell you welcome back.  They are extremely helpful and offer to help you make selections if they notice you lingering in a particular section like I always do.

The selection of food is relatively small, but all the food is far superior to what you would find at any other pet store.  Nothing but the best for our pets in this store.  They even offer a list that tells you what ingredients to look for and which ones to avoid when it comes to choosing food for your four legged friend.

There are tons of fun toys to choose from and the staff is happy to offer recommendations.  Although, if you have a super chewer like we do, stick with the solid rubber toys.  You do have to remember though, that with high quality comes a proportional price in the dog toy world.

I think he likes it too.  There are three levels of washing available.  With the Basic, you do all the scrubbing and use house shampoo.  The next level up you do all the scrubbing but you have your choice of premium shampoos.  The highest level offers the convenience of a self scrubbing nozzle and your choice of premium shampoos.  The prices are decent considering you're doing most of the work.  However I will pay a premium not to clean up after the mess.

Bottom line, if you love your pet and only want the best, go to Wag N' Wash.  You will not regret it.",2009-03-03 16:42:05

My friend and I came here for a light lunch and figured we would try it out since we always go to the same places. What a mistake! We were pretty hungry and everything looked pretty good but it was such a terrible disappointment. First of all, the place is so shabby. It looks like it used to be a really cute, clean, and chic spot but has since fell into disrepair and lazy keeping. When we went up to the counter to order, it was really disorganized and the girl behind the counter beckoned another customer forward, even though we were there first. When it was finally our turn to order, I asked the girl how much for the salads in the refrigerator case and she said in a very condescending way, ""They're sold by weight""...A little unnecessary, but okay, maybe I overlooked something on the menu that said that. So I ordered a ""small"" beet salad, which looked really yummy with goat cheese and walnuts. My friend order something hot (I can't remember, quiche or pasta or something) which took 15+ minutes to arrive at our table. While waiting for her food, I started on my beet salad, which cost $8 or $9 and was a very small portion. The beets weren't even cooked all the way through! They were huge chunks which made it so difficult to eat, not to mention totally unappetizing. I was so disappointed to have spent the money on a tiny portion that was completely inedible. My friend even offered to take me to our usual lunch spot on Queen and pay for lunch there (bless her heart) but I just said forget it and tried to eat the rest of my salad. I normally don't like to send food back unless there is a major problem with it, and in this case I didn't, but I regret not asking for my money back as I just couldn't eat it. 

My friend's hot food finally came and she was kind enough to share a few bites with me. It was actually pretty good, from what I remember, so that's what earned this place an extra star...Although I probably would've only given it 1.5 at MOST. We left a short while later and I bought a chai latte from the Starbucks next door to supplement my meager meal. Boo. Thumbs all the way down.",2014-08-25 18:38:22

Standard chips and 4 salsas were brought.  The salsas are tomatillo, fire roasted tomato, regular tomato salsa, and a bean dip.  They're all good, but my favorite is the fire roasted.

We started with table side made guacamole, and it was very good.  I got it not spicy because my wife is the ultimate gringa.  I put all the peppers on my side of the bowl after our server had finished.  How gringa is she you ask?  If you wave a pepper over the plate, she'll say it's too spicy.  Enough said.

For the main course, I got the carne asada platter, slices of skirt steak with pasilla chiles and cotija cheese.  With it comes a cheese enchilada, some pico, and sides of veggies and black beans (my choice but there are other beans or Mexican potatoes available.  My wife had the pollo ranchero.  It's the most gringa thing on the menu.  She also had the sides but thought they were spicy (they weren't).  Each entree comes with a salad with your choice of dressing.  I've always thought this was odd for a Mexican restaurant.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate pecan ball which is a vanilla bean ice cream ball dipped in chopped pecans and has chocolate drizzled over it!  It was excellent.

First off the staff is very professional.....very young but very professional. They did make a few execution errors (like couldn't fine the right table throughout the night) but hey, that didn't detract one bit from the awsome meal we had.

First off we started with their Burrata mozzarella...which, for those of you unfamiliar with this unctuous dish, is a mozzarella cheese stuffed with cream and milk. It's outrageously delicious! They served this app with fresh heirloom tomatoes and a balsamic glaze. Oh so yummy!

Then my date got the Veal Chop and I got the Scallop special. OMG were both awesome! She got the Veal Chop done Med Rare and the outside was perfectly seared while the inside velvety soft. This was served over a bed of sauteed mushrooms which my date didn't care for (it's a female-texture thing....) but I gladly wolfed down!

I got the Scallop special, servered over an eggplant puree. The scallops were perfectly done, and seasoned to perfection. We both agreed that this dish was one of the best each of us has had in months!

Then for the finale.....we got their signature BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE and PISTACHIO TORTA, topped with passion fruit sorbet, made by their Pastry Chef, Frank Kaltsounis. Let me tell you....I'm somewhat of a dessert snob/harsh critic but I couldn't find one flaw in this dessert! It was PERFECTION! They somehow got 2 layers of chocolate moose over a pistachio crust, and topped it with a Mango puree! It should not work but it was AMAZING! Anyone reading this review needs to go there and try it and let me know what you think! It was I believe the best dessert I've had in my 3.5 years in Charlotte, and I've had a LOT of desserts!

We ordered WAYYYYY to much wine which drove the bill much higher than I would have liked. BUT, they DO have a fabulous wine list.....just don't order the 8 glasses like we did and you're bill will be reasonable. But that was our fault....a ""fault"" I could live with. 

Our waitress Alyssa was a doll, and superbly nice. The Manager came by and chatted with us, making sure we were happy and also was very professional and cordial.

Yes, you heard me right. We MADE each other's wedding bands. Three words: Best. Date. Ever.

We chose to make ours in sterling silver (I'm allergic to gold), but you can also make gold rings as well. In a matter of 5 hours, we turned a couple beads of silver into two gorgeous wedding bands. Johanna was amazing, and walked us through every step. She made herself totally available for the whole day and was so helpful and patient. We knew nothing about the process, and not only did she show us what to do, but she explained why we did it that way. My husband made me a small, delicate braided band, and I made him a very masculine band with comfort grip and a matte finish. Both turned out flawless and stunning, thanks to all of the support from the owner. There are also options to set stones in the rings, but for now we're sticking with the beautifully simple bands that our friends and family are always oohing and aahhing at. Plus, who else can say that they literally made their significant other's ring with their bare hands?

Harold Studio also offers classes, which I am dying to try! Some of the jewelry they make out there is amazing. They are even making dog tags this season! So creative!

The first time I walked in the smell of fresh croissants wafted in the air. They import the dough from France and bake it fresh daily. It has the right pull, the beautiful flaky exterior and a flavor like no other croissant I've ever had. From there I began ordering sandwiches and literally worked my way through the menu. Every single one is flavorful and down right delicious. I'm hooked. The best part? They make my chai tea better than Starbucks. Yum!

There were several specials written up on the wall, but they were all meaty, so I took to the menu.  On this particular night, I was hankering for some cheese...don't judge me.

Sweet!!  As we were waiting for the appetizer, he brought us out some fresh pita and tasty garlic bread.  When the app came out, it was piping hot and oh so good!

I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of my entree, the grilled tofu - it was just meh. But it might have to do more for the fact that I don't really enjoy grilled tofu. Why did I order this dish you might ask...well I wasn't really in the mood for meat or fish so I figured I'd give it a whirl. But for a vegetarian dish it wasn't awful. It was fairly light which is what I was looking for.

Food - Duck sausage with onions and peppers, dirty duck fat fries
Drink - flight of beers (6 samples) and some more beer
Ambiance - lively, a bit loud, fun. 

I highly recommend the duck sausage with onions and peppers. It was soft and flavourful! The Dirty Duck Fat Fries were fries topped with onions and peppers (so, kinda the same as the sausage) but also with some jalapenos and sauce. It was good, but the flavours were the same as my own sausage so it didn't wow me. There were 3 types of mustards though, which was really fun. 

The flight of beers was also fun - getting to try different ones, and then ordering your favourite if you're inclined. They also have ciders as a gluten-free option. In fact, this place is pretty good for non-gluten-eaters!",2016-09-06 16:24:05

Our first trip was with a few friends to chat about life in general.  We had no trouble finding a booth by the window to enjoy each other's company.  The food was great!  Being a vegetarian, I ordered the veggie burger and was not disappointed.  However, I requested blue cheese crumbles because I don't like goat cheese.  I was quickly informed they do not carry blue cheese (GASP).  It's like a staple of every kitchen serving burgers.  What!!?   I assumed my overreaction would cause them to reconsider adding the item on their menu.  Coming back a second time, we had burgers (mine being veggie again) and like the first time it was super delish.  I think they must put crack in their fries because I can't stop eating them.  Welp, still no blue cheese.  Grrrrrr.   Ok, so surely a third visit would do the trick.  Nope.  I came back with a large group of friends this time.  Still no dang blue cheese.  I'm going to have to BYOBC (bring your own blue cheese) next time.  So frustrating.  Anyway, my only critique beyond the blue cheese is that they only give you tiny cups with ketchup in them.  You have to order tons of cups to get enough ketchup for your fries.  Their Bloody Mary is good (not great... it could be spicier).  They plenty of seating and lots of great outdoor space.

I had the German Chocolate Apple, which was very good. The sweetness of the chocolate and coconut blended well with the sourness of the green apple.

I would suggest getting something other than the regular caramel apple. Reason being, most of the caramel stuck to the paper that it was placed on. At least with the others, the toppings prevent the caramel from sticking.

Fortunately, it appeared to have a promising successor in Nu, which has the same ownership (Pamela's) and a menu that is inventive and appropriate for the neighborhood.

I visited Nu with some friends last week and was thoroughly impressed. We started with the appetizer platter ($15), a bountiful array of meat blintzes, kreplach, fried potato puffs, and fried pickles. All were quite tasty, especially the fried items.

Moving on to the main courses, it is difficult to choose from all the tantalizing sandwiches, each one featuring Nu's house-smoked meats. We ultimately went with the Reuben Knishwich and the Upstreet Dip ($12 each). The former is a creative take on my favorite sandwich: the meat, cheese and kraut are finely diced and baked into a pastry. The result is a delicious and filling stomach bomb that is surprisingly different from a traditional Reuben. The dip was a more standard affair consisting of a baguette filled with thick slabs of juicy brisket slathered in cheese and horseradish sauce.  It too was excellent and generously portioned.

Nu is BYOB, so we brought some wine and beer to drink with our meal; when the check arrived, we were pleased to see no corkage fee. All told the bill came to $20/person after tax and tip, a fantastic bargain for such a delicious and filling meal. Service was friendly and attentive. 

In closing, Nu is a welcome addition to Pittsburgh; I don't know of any other place in the city that serves this type of food. Their menu manages to be both traditional and creative, and their execution is spot-on. Here's hoping it sticks around.",2013-12-30 16:06:00

However, we were here for a slot tourney anyway and it was the easiest option.

The first time, it was a little busy so the service was somewhat slow but not terrible; had pretty good burgers, giant crispy onion rings, and the Anaconda was in heaven with the handmade hot fudge shake. 

So, I was already ok with it, but on the way out we saw the dessert case with individual cakes displayed and got a chocolate for him and a cheesecake with white chocolate curls on it for me. We were pretty full but each took a bite when we got back to the room. Turned out to be a restless night, with each of us popping up in paranoia when we heard (or thought we heard) the other one stirring, convinced our cake was under attack. When I actually did catch the Anaconda in the act, we  just got up and ate them. Those things were GREAT, and so rich and sweet that either of them would have been plenty to share, but we didn't!

This time I went with Babygirl, and she was not impressed with the busy atmosphere or the open-to-the-casino-traffic floor plan, but we were seated immediately by a smiling host and our waitress, Alex, was pleasant and quick. BG ordered water to drink and immediately made a face, pronouncing it the most chlorinated she'd ever had. Personally, I've never objected to that flavor- always reminded me of swimming pools and childhood summers, but she is spoiled by overpriced bottled varieties so she traded it in for the $5 mimosa, which was served not in a champagne flute but a good sized tumbler - quite a bargain and they let her take it with her.

She had a chicken melt (10.99) which had grilled herbed breast meat and avocado on a giant ciabatta roll. It looked great and she loved it. Very impressive since she was in a mood that day. My BLT (8.99) was also good- served on lightly toasted sourdough, which gave it a just-right texture: held up to the chewy bacon and wet tomatoes and mayo, but wasn't hard enough to shatter or shred the inside of your mouth, which sadly is often the case. Fries were hot, crispy and tasty.

Of course, I was still hungry (meaning, ""not stuffed"") since she refused to give me any bites of her chicken, so I ordered the bread pudding (5.99), which was dense and hot, and came with a scoop of ice cream, a glop of whipped cream, caramel syrup, and a scattering of crunchy pecans. It also came with an extra spoon, which Babygirl used with a vengeance, not even seeing the ironic glances I cast at her to-go box.

I have to admit that I had fairly low expectations of this show - based primarily on the name. ""Showstoppers"" sounds like a cruise ship or community theater show. I couldn't have been more wrong.This is a top-notch, extravagent, beyond-professional production. 

The beautiful live orchestra alone is worth the ticket price. You just don't hear that sound anymore. Some of the best musicians in Vegas are up there, and they knock it out of the park.

The performers were also absolutely Broadway caliber. It is one of the best-danced shows that I've ever seen anywhere.  

The lead performers just radiated charisma and talent - especially  Kerry O'malley, who brought pure star quality to everything that she did. She is every bit the equal of LuPone, Marin Mazzzie, and Audra McDonald. I'm amazed that I haven't heard more of her before this. 

I didn't love every number. Some were just odd choices, but all were done well. 

So, the caveats?
There are two main reasons to see this show. 
1. To see and hear classic Broadway numbers performed with a quality that mostly surpasses Broadway.
2. To see an old-school Vegas production show, jazzed up with beautiful sets, gorgeous costumes, and lots of eye-candy on the stage. 

If neither of those two things appeal to you, you might want to consider other options.

It was 11:30 on a Saturday and the place was empty. The entire time we were there 2 separate people came in and picked up food to-go. 
The place was clean I will say that. But the negatives are just overwhelming.

I want to say that when I visit places like this I am simply amazed. It takes guts and money to open and run a restaurant. Why, why do it if you're not going to do the best you can? Why waste your time? Why not do something else that will make you happy? This business is TOUGH. Doing just an OK job is not worth the time. And please understand, I love mom and pop joints. I respect them and frequent them as much as I can. I've been in and around the hospitality business since 1980 when I opened my own catering business while going to ASU.
I'm here trying to instill good values on my son C and help him understand that yes, he can do whatever he wants when he gets older, BUT, whatever he chooses to do, he has to give it his all. No ""half in, half out"" attitude. 

There was one lady working when we got there. By the time we left another young girl showed up but other than saying ""good bye"" we had no interaction with her. Do you see the pic of this place with the little kid looking to the side and no one in the place? That's how it is. A Saturday lunch time and NO ONE sat there but C and I.

C ordered the Kids Cheeseburger ($5.49). The patty was overcooked. Plus the patty was this tiny little thing that looked completely silly sitting on the bun. The fries? Straight out of the freezer. Institutional bagged frozen fries. Really? How hard is it to prep potatoes? Cut em, wash em, par cook em, freeze em, fry em to order. Well, this is what you do when you CARE about the product you're selling. As I said above. Why do this if you're not going to give it your best? Also, with the kids meal comes a cookie. Ah, well that's what the menu said. What C got was a BlowPop. Again, how hard is it to buy a tub of Toll House dough and bake some cookies every day? This meal should have been $2.99 and that's being generous.

I ordered the Cheeseburger Combo ($9.59). Wow, where to start. The patty had way to much black pepper applied. Salt level was fine. The temp was OK. The bun was nothing special as well. I've already commented on the fries. All in all this combo should have been $5.99 if that.

Also, the lady that rang up our order also cooked it. We were sitting at our table so I didn't get to see if she washed her hands after handling my money but I hope so. I would also like to add that while we were there and as we left, C kept asking me why someone would sell such lousy food?

Some items are good, like the fried fish cakes (deep fried, piping hot, good order size, sitting on a bed of pickled radish and so delicious), and some items are not so good like the bimbimbap (missing egg, seaweed, bean sprouts, kimchi... when asked the waitress why the dish did not have half the items shown in the picture, she said the menu is old and they haven't changed it yet. So for $9, my friend got a really big bowl of rice and some carrots, some beef.. and I'm not sure what else there was.....).

The flavour wasn't immersed in the meat though, and some pieces tasted pretty bland. I also got the soy tofu with ginger for dessert. It was very gingery and hot which made it perfect for winter. The syrup was served on the side so you can choose how sweet you want it to taste. 

Overall, I think this place is good for desserts or snacks and to chat in (the setting and environment is perfect to catch up with friends) but this is NOT the place to eat a good meal. My friend ranted about her meal for the next few hours.. and she also told our other friends, her parents and maybe even some strangers on the road. Like I said, the food is hit or miss.

The restaurant overlooks the main floor of Crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. Very spacious with plenty of seating area.

I've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. In fact, I think I'm even more impressed each and every time I go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. 

Service: Impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. I've had a light skinned African American male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing I should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. I've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. 

Food: To die for. The best bone-in ribeye I've ever had. I've tried quite a few steakhouses in Las Vegas (ribeyes because I am obsessed) and none compare to Mastro's. Their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! I've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, tuna tartare, lobster mashed potatoes (a must try), Gorgonzola mac and cheese, king crab black truffle gnocchi, creamed corn, and the brussels sprouts (gotta have some veggies).

Wine: They have one of my favorite Cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, Chateau St. Jean. Highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.

Dessert: Do the butter cake. Comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. Sweet, warm, and delicious!

I gave it another go recently for lunch, ordering up the 2 time mushroom with fried tofu. The tofu isn't breaded or particularly interesting, just cooked and then slathered in some dark sauce with mushrooms and a few other veggies. It's an okay dish and will work in a pinch of you like mushrooms.

The vegetable eggroll was just disappointing. Soggy exterior and not so great.

The food prices are a bit on the high side though. Service was very good, my water glass was never empty for long. What I liked most about this restaurant and why I chose to give it four stars was the ambience: it was not loud. 

There was music playing in the background but it was muted so I could talk with everyone at our table without having to shout and ask people to repeat what they just said. And even as the restaurant got busier into the evening with more guests, I could still easily talk to everyone in our party. It was definitely a nice change of pace from other restaurants who are trying to be nightclubs as an afterthought.

This neighborhood treat is literally a 5 min walk from me and JUST OPENED yesterday! yay. I've been always wondering what Menchies was all about and what were they going to bring to the competitive yogurt franchises all over the world. 

At first glance entering Menchies, you can definitely see that the atmosphere shows FUN & VIBRANT! with the modern decor, colors, separate party room for any type of event, a large chalk board to write on for kicks, friendly work staff, and even their very own Menchies ""Character"" (cute pacman eyes, lil smile, and a colorful swirl for the head/hair). I like that they sell cute gifts and nicknacks for Menchies because its too cute to resist :P

Going to the yogurt... one thing that stands out here compared to other yogurt spots I've been to is the fact that they offer a WAFFLE BOWL!! mmm...the smell of the fresh batch of waffle aroma! what a cool and fun twist to have with your yogurt! (kind of reminds me of cold stone, but a lot healthier). 

Highlights***
- this place has different yogurt flavors not offered in other fro-yo places. 
- there is a vast amount of toppings to choose from ANNND
 (this part I'm happy about) is the fact that the toppings is super convenient to grab yourself! you know how some places like yogurtland and u-swirl, theres a window so low that it interferes/blocks you which you'd have to really extend your arms just to reach for the back row! sucks for people who are tall or big!! damn LOL. Well good thinking on Menchies part for making this experience quick n' easy! just like candy stores. cool points! 

My yogurt concotion: was feelin fruity ; )
Yogurt - island banana & mango sorbet
Toppings - strawberries, kiwis, granola and a cherry on top 
And of course in a waffle bowl! 39cents p/oz, $1.00 more w/waffle

My wife went with the famous lobster sandwich and I was just glad I didn't order it.  To me, the lobster didn't taste good at all and the with the big price tag on it, I thought it was a disappointment.

We did come back recently to test out the happy hour.  We thought we could try out a wide variety of dishes on the cheap and get a better feel for the place.  On the plus side, I'd go back for $2 14oz drafts all day.  You won't find a better deal than that from what I can tell.  Unfortunately, of all the happy hour items we tried, a majority I wouldn't get again.  Those included the mac and cheese bites, buffalo chicken bites, chicken spring rolls, and short rib sliders.

We each ordered steak tacos; I ordered the original, she ordered the fajita. We also ordered the chicken taquitos. We ordered To-Go, and even though they said it would be ready in ten minutes, we arrived between about 15-20 minutes after placing the order and still had to wait about 5-10 minutes before receiving our food. A little odd considering the place was practically empty.

We got back to the hotel and started chowing down! The tacos come in little shark-shaped holders, which is cute--each one individually labeled. The steak in these tacos is delicious! It's not a dominating flavor, but very subtle, and melds very well with the rest of the flavors. As for the chicken taquitos, they were rather dry. The chicken did have good flavor though, so that's a plus! 

A minor complaint is that when we received our order at the restaurant, there's wasn't any silverware or napkins in our bag. I don't mind having to get my own silverware from beside a drink machine, but since it can be rather difficult to get utensils while in a hotel room, I wish either (A) we were informed about the absence of silverware in the bag, or (B) already had the silverware in the bag to begin with. I expect to have to get my own utensils from a place like Chipotle, not Sharky's--and that's a good thing.

Mo20ZP7t8PZsllCyPbToLA,bzapbb28xMO0NE9oRK27gg,WQY_fR1PuY5wsXmK2VhPvQ,4,8,0,3,"Dropped in for a burger today after noticing this joint recently and checking the previous reviews here.  I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that I really want a little local joint like this to be successful.  If the grub is good, I'll continue to support it and its kind.

I ordered a double-burger, hold the cheese (Brak is trying to drop a few pounds), and an order of fries (whoops!).  The burger was good if not outstanding.  The patties are fried, but not too greasy, and the meat tasted fresh.  The standard condiments are the universally clichÃ© thousand island dressing, lettuce, tomato & onion.  The TI dressing was a bit weak, but the fixins were fresh and tasty.  The fries were very good.  A solid 3-star meal - pretty good, but nothing to distinguish it.  Brak adds a half star for the excellent fries, and a half star for local non-franchise ownership, pushing the overall rating to a 4 on the Brak-o-meter.

I fear that these guys might have trouble staying open.  A sign on the door stated that they were now closing at 5:30pm daily, and I was there around 12:45pm, and was the only customer in the joint.  Too bad, it's a worthy destination for a better-than-decent burger.  If you're a local or in the area, give it a try, I think you'll like it.  I'll be back.",2009-08-04 21:56:35

I always found the Ayrsley development to be poorly planned for retail space.  Parking is a bear here but at least there is a parking deck within a short walk of Harry's.  

I parked myself at the bar which was a bit awkward for seating.  My knees hit the intricate work on the front of the bar so it was a bit uncomfortable.  Also the chair to bar height ratio was a little off.

The lunch menu wasn't large but it had a good selection of small plates, sandwiches and salads.   I was also looking at the beer selection and it looks like they have all craft beers on tap with many of them local.  

For lunch, I ordered the fish tacos.  There were 3 of them which were quite messy.  They were decent but the fish was a little tough.

Service was ok.  It wasn't busy and there were 2 people somewhat working the bar.  But yet they only refilled my tea glass when i was ready to leave.

Still this place intrigues me as I looked over their dinner menu, I find myself wanting to return and give them another chance to impress me.",2014-07-13 15:20:19

Things started out promising with the Tom yum soup.  It was pretty tasty.  
After that, the meal dropped off substantially.  Zucchini and shrimp peanut sauce was oddly sweet and there was no ""stir fry"" carmelization of the onions or shrimp but rather just seemed to be dunked into the sauce.
The candy chicken was really quite disappointing.  Way too many little battered pieces of flour and the odd snipet of chicken if you dig around enough in the sauce.  Sauce was soupy and had a weak soy flavour.
The coconut rice was just plain rice coconut milk poured on top of rice that wasn't particularly flavourful with coconut.

I came here for dinner when I was feeling a bit tired/hungover and it was the perfect cure. The waitress was super friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in, and I was able to get one of my favourite dark beers and my first ever root beer float straight away (although she seemed a little amused that both of those items were for me). The root beer float had heaps of ice cream and they give you the rest of the glass bottle to keep topping up the root beer (making it foam even more!).
I got the Dairy Lane Burger, and added a bunch of extras like mushroom (because it's not really a burger without mushroom), bacon (ditto, which came extra crispy just as requested - as bacon should be), peppered gouda (because by now I was just on a roll) and happily changed the sauce for me to sweet pepper mayo when I spied it lurking on another burger. Even better, you can get a side of soup with the burger, and the soup of the day was potato and bacon. Even more bacon! I'm pretty sure this 'soup' is really just a grownup way of eating mashed potato with bacon, but I love it. 
This place takes part in Mealshare, and have a separate menu where if you buy something off that menu, they donate a meal to Mealshare. I loved this idea but just couldn't pass up the burger on the regular menu.

They don't take reservations  I went with a friend who's been there several times and she says the wait can be very long. We were lucky to wait about 15 mins. It's a cute little coffee shop/resto. 

They have a small menu that's limited with what you can order during the week and weekend. They have a lot of salad options. I decided to go for the grilled cheese sandwich. I didn't enjoy it much because of the caramelized onions that were quite bitter. They serve it with their house ketchup which was very good. I also ordered a latte which was the perfect drink to have after work on a windy day. My friend ordered a salad with bread. I loved their bread. It was very soft and tasty. The best part was the extra large cookie we had for dessert. It was cold though and we asked if they can warm it in a microwave and they said no. However we still enjoyed it very much! They have a huge selection of baked goods and patisserie. My friend recommended to go their on the weekend for breakfast which I will probably. 

I wasn't too impressed with their menu or food. The server said it changes with season, so everything my friend had in the past wasn't available. Our server was very nice and helpful explaining the menu and our options. The place is quite packed, almost claustrophobic. It is nicely decorated with a woodsy theme.

Calamari - Out of this world good!!! 5/5. The calamari were prepped PERFECTLY. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I was addicted to their slightly spicy Thai sweet sauce. It still resonates with me how GOOD it was.

Poutine Bravas - Mediocre. 2/5. Truth be told we ordered this for the Bravas name and not for the poutine. I loved eating Bravas potatoes while visiting Spain and while the sour cream and sauce were right putting it in a.... poutine was a letdown. Also it was slightly cold which makes a poutine experience less than desirable. Please consider Bravas fries.

Fried Cauliflower in Truffle Oil - Very good. 4/5. Originally just OK but my appreciation for this dish changed the more I ate it!

Paella for 2 - Very good. 4/5. The plate is very generous and could easily feed 4 people! I love paella and the dish hit the spot minus the rice tasting a little under-cooked.

Cucumber Mojito - Average. 3/5. It held too much alcohol and not enough taste to make me enjoy a cucumber Mojito. Truth be told, the tapas outshined this drink.


For dessert...


Caramel Sale, pecan chocolate cookies : Perfect! 5.5. That sweet and sour taste was the real deal. It was provided on the house, so kudos for that!

Mini-Churros with caramel sale : Very good! 4/5. Would give 5/5 if it wasn't mini.....mini and standard size taste quite different. It was crunchy but I like the softness of the inside and it was missed.


Service was great all night long. Our waitress was sweet and made the whole experience very welcoming. 5 STARS!

Price tag is about $40 per person which gives it decent value. I expect tables of 4 can really try out a huge amount of dishes.

Alright. So even though Sakana has its days when it's super amazing. Sometime I shake my head and wonder wth is going on. Today I have officially been eating here consistently for over a year. I just met the third owner of Sakana and am wondering how is it that she co-owns this place and was puzzled when I asked for half rolls... the manager was in a panic the entire time and somehow we got someone else's roll, and jacob didn't get half of this order. Do NOT try the wasabi taco. It is soooooo Gross. And apparently week day service is absolute shit. To add to that, the only reason why we got a table so quickly is because the couple got up and left since they hadn't been serviced yet. Did I mention it took my boyfriend 25 minutes to get his credit card back.

I rarely give high reviews. But I really like this place. My boyfriend and I come here all the time, at least 3 times a month. This place is really well priced for what they have. 

$23-25 all you can eat sushi, including drinks, appetizers and desserts. 

As far as the quality of the sushi, it's not fantastic but pretty good. 

The only downside I would have to say is, don't experiment too much. I love trying different things but usually end up regretting most of my choices. The appetizer, ""the shit"" is probably the best experimental item on the menu.

You may have to wave down the server a few times to order unless you sit at the bar, you only have to wave them down for non roll items",2017-04-07 23:18:45

Parking here is interesting.  The front lot gets filled up quickly as it is super small and large SUV's like to take up all the spots.  The parking behind the building is much easier to get in and out of but harder to find if you don't know where to look.

I myself had never been to Letty's, but after reading the menu, I was looking forward to checking it out and enjoying some good old cooking.

After almost getting lost, I came upon the Letty's sign and was thrilled. The restaurant is definitely off the beaten path.  Once inside I noticed the restaurant is divided, one side with a bar and a few small tables and the other specifically for the dining area.  The restaurant was packed, but luckily we had a reservation.  Letty herself came to our table and walked us through the menu, highlighting the specials, what they were out of for the night and definitely focused some time on the wine list, as they offer some that cannot be found in the state at this time.

After Letty left, service became a little shady.  We arrived at 7:00 and by 7:45 we had yet to receive our drinks.  After asking for some bread, being that butter was on the table and you're typically brought bread when there is butter, our waiter brought me, and only me, a biscuit.  Really? And, the worst past was it was definitely out of the microwave because it was hard a brick on the bottom but soft of the top. I attempted to eat it, but it tasted horrible.

We had a group of ten so our party had a variety of dinner options, including the Pecan Chicken, Smothered Fried Chicken, Fish & Chips, Burgers and a few others.  Everyone who had the chicken loved it!  I ordered the Fish and Chips and absolutely loved the chips. The fish was okay, a little small and the batter was a little mushy.  Overall it was good, but I have definitely had better Fish & Chips. I did taste some of the Pimento Cheese burger and I should have gone with that, so delish!

What we like;
The chips and salsa with the bean dip are a winner. There are two different salsas; one with a little kick and one mild. The bean dip also has a little spice, which is refreshing. As a matter of fact, this is really the only Mexican place that has a little default spice in their dishes...not bland like so many other places.
The selections are numerous, so they have a nice variety.
$1 House margaritas during happy hour.
The Steak Tampico is cooked very nicely and carries some real spice...super yummy.

What is not so great:
The service is inconsistent in the bar area. I haven't had a problem in the dining area. I don't know if they assign to many tables to one person, or if they have a problem with people calling out, but it is definitely hit and miss.

The last visit there, the masa on the end tamale was hard...like rock hard. I am thinking that they nuke these things, since most places don't steam them to order, and got ridiculously carried away

Location/environment:
Midtown area - a little difficult to find parking (so do please carpool).  The restaurant has 2 entrance cause they took over two units.  Very relaxing modern interior.  There were a lot of people coming in for summerlicious (do book in advance) - but they require the entire party to show up first before getting a table (a little frustrating, especially when you might be late due to traffic/parking)

Service:
Waitress was very nice and also friendly staff.  Since it was for summerlicious, they weren't willing to add a little flexibility in the menu.  One of my friend wanted to switch fries for a salad, but they couldn't let her.

Food:
Appetizers were oysters (3 in total), which was based on what's available for the day.  I had kusshi, which was never a disappointment - very fresh and they provided a wide selection of sauces to fit each person's needs.
Main dish was fish and chips.  The batter was well made and not too oily. The meat inside was also soft - particularly not dry (cause I hate it being dry).  I really liked their fries and the tartar sauce.
Dessert was a lemon semi-fredo.  It was very sour - good for cleaning down the fatty food I had.  Also it had a blueberry sauce and poppy seeds, which can divert the sourness away.

Overall not bad for a first try, would consider coming again to try more of their oysters and other dishes.",2015-07-28 14:23:39

After going to other ayces where we placed our orders through an iPad, I was reminded of the pain it was to have to wave down our server to submit and check on our orders every single time at Matsuda. Although there were multiple staffs who brought out our foods, we were only allowed to order with our assigned server. She never volunteered her time to check on our table; we had to get the other staffs to find her for us. By the time our second order was served, there was a 30 minutes of sitting/waiting around in between. 

Foods - mediocre at best. All the shrimp items were heavily preserved with msg. The tempura and fried times were cold when served. Sushi and sashimi took at least an additional 30 minutes after all the hot foods were brought to us. The sweet shrimp sashimi were strangely dry and salty. The best item of the night coming from an ayce Japanese was unfortunately its ginger steamed milk. The ginger taste was distinct and the dessert for the majority of the time was served hot. Forget about mediocre sushi and sashimi, I chose to fill my stomach with multiple orders of this instead.

We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters! 

The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people. 

Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though. 

The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!

The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay. Only two waiters working when we went so it was a bit slow, but they were all super friendly! Will be coming back here again! One of my fave American food places for sure!",2015-02-02 05:51:59

I recommend getting reservations, because this place was packed!  And don't flake on your reservation, either.  These guys mean it when you make a reservation because if you no-show, they charge you $50 per head!  Opps did you oversleep?  That's a pretty expensive nap you just took.

It's right by the sportsbook at Caesar's Palace.  We arrived right on time and were promptly seated.  The menu isn't quite as big as I was expecting, so we were able to narrow it down to 3 things, with pictures attached.  Ranked in order, they were:
-scallop salad.  Micro greens, 3 scallops with a slightly spicy dry rub, and balsamic vinegar-like dressing.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight of the dinner.
-lobster.  It's cooked and taken out of the shell, so it's easy to eat and therefore you're not creating a mess in a fancy Las Vegas restaurant.  Mrs. C states that the sauce tastes like reduced bisque, and quite delicious.
-pork tenderloin + twice baked potato.  The 3 pieces of pork tenderloin had a spicy dry rub, and then are nicely plated with 2 more sauces.  I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy food, but this was a tad too spicy for me.  The twice baked potato was good, but I should have gotten it without the horseradish.  Our server, to her credit, told us that the horseradish is mixed in, but not spicy.  She was right and it wasn't spicy, but knowing what I know now, I would have skipped the horseradish part of it.

This is a good meal, and there's no question that there is a lot of attention to detail to the food and our service was quite good.  I just think that for the money spent, this is an average value, and that's why I marked down 1 star.  Our dinner the day before at Sedona Lounge was only half the cost per person, and I was much happier.

Note #2: Ritters is a 24/7/365 restaurant that offers its entire menu from breakfast to lunch to dinner all day and all night every single day. And man, did we have a blast with this! Keep readin', pilgrim...

I am not a lush of any kind, and this past Friday morning, I unsuspectingly fell madly in love with Ritters Diner. 

We had thought of going to Ritters during the graveyard shift one weekend, but being that the establishment reportedly attracts Pittsburgh's young, intoxicated, and obnoxious during that time and that I have little patience for such humanoids, that plan was nixed. However, on a frosted, lightless payday Friday morn, Kay was waiting on a background check before she could start her new job, and I needed sustenance before work. When we both awoke earlier than expected, Ritters immediately came to mind, and suddenly, it was Bloomfield or bust!

I enjoy a wholesome, solid, mountain-man breakfast sans bells, whistles, and rainbow jimmies as much as any other blue-collar bloke, but when burgers and fried chicken can be had at 6:30 AM, omelets and pancakes become too drab and obvious. Besides, I'm also an Aquarian, and when put into boxes, we tend to think our way out of 'em.

And the Pittsburgh City Paper said that Sousa's main gentrification vehicle Salt of the Earth ""blurs distinctions."" Heh. 

Enter the beast known as The Pitts-burger. Centered 'round a thick, bleeding medium-rare patty, this Goliath of ground beef included BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, and a fried egg. One of THE essential burgers encountered during my dining lifetime, it dripped, oozed, kissed, stung, and occupied that roaring void in my stomach like few have. The bun was toasted and was not without a hint of butter. The Pitts-burger may strangle your heart, but it will do it so, so softly. 

The french fries were burning majestic scepters of yellow, mashed potato chip glory.

Kay's fried chicken smacked of honey, crackling when our teeth punctured the  homemade batter to reveal sultry poultry inside. Our lovingly irreverent and streetwise server told us that Ritters sells more clucker parts than the nearby KFC does, and I want to believe her. The Colonel's mass-produced swill deserves to be outclassed. 

Our desserts were Chocolate Cream Pie and Strawberry Shortcake. The Chocolate Cream Pie should be renamed the Chocolate Dream Pie for its velvety, otherworldly pudding filling, it's flagrantly flaky crust, and its sweetness-cutting whipped cream garnish. The Strawberry Shortcake was akin to slices of golden shortbread mortared together by preserves and topped with a gilded white buttercream. 

To us, there was nothing dingy about Ritters. Jukeboxes lined the perimeter of the dining room and abstract sculptures of labyrinthine iron jutted from sides of the booths. Burly, middle-aged men in work clothes patronized the diner instead of immature partygoers. Some are making Ritters out to be a ""last chance"" sort of place that they seem to want to like less than they do, giving out backhanded kudos to it as if it were a dirty old strip club that amused them and nothing more. When I looked around Ritters and relished its classic, economical cuisine, I saw, tasted, and felt nothing but timelessness, integrity, and an affectionate mindfulness of quality.  

I don't know how many years Ritters Diner has been in operation, but I do know that I'd hate to see it uprooted by renewal and replaced with something that is exploitative of indigenous food such as Thai fusion or whatever else the privileged have co-opted this week.

Forgo the East End's glitter and skitter o'er to Ritters for some food that will leave ya the opposite of...bitter.",2013-01-28 02:22:02

Not only a market but a deli and fabulous liquor store as well.
They have a great selection of beers. I cannot find imported beers such as these in many parts down town. Most places just carry high gravity swill and bud light.
Finding DogFish Head is great!!

The deli is wonderful. A bit high priced. I give them 5 stars but the PRICE is the only thing that sucks here. Pretty much everything costs more here for some reason.
They make a great pasta salad.

On the bright side they have soooooooo many organic items, and wonderful alternative products. I think this place is a tiny gem hidden in the concrete jungle that is downtown.

The food is always consistent at Guu, and I love their okonomiyaki and takoyaki the most. (Even more than the ones we ate in Osaka and Tokyo, to be honest.)

The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars? The panko-encrusted brie cheese needs more sauce! If the Guu chefs could start putting their delicious mango-berry sauce in a side dish, that would be perfect.",2015-07-05 04:01:22

I had a hard time finding the place.  According to the address numbering it should have been on the Southeast corner, but it is actually on the Southwest corner behind SuperPawn in the strip mall.  My first impression upon entering was that this place is ghetto.  They had couches and 8 or 10 barber chairs.  Everything seemed run down.  Most of the leather was cracked.  Hip hop played on the radio.  I chose not to judge the book by its cover and give it a try.  Only three barbers were working.  There was no check-in station.  A barber called me over and we began.  My barber, Cal, worked quickly but did a good job.  He seemed like a cool guy.  I did not like how they used compressed air to blow the hair pieces off your head and shoulders.  It was too loud and made my ears ring.  All stations had that set up so I assume it is standard practice there.  Cal said the place has been open for seven years.  Cal told me about several celebrities that get their hair cut there.  The cut was $15 before tip.  I felt like I got my money's worth.  I would go back, but I prefer a different atmosphere.  I'm not suggesting that they change their style.  That is their niche.  If you like the ""thug life"" atmosphere and hip-hop haircuts than this joint is for you.

We met my niece and her fiancÃ©e for dinner as they live in the area...and we opted to dine out on the patio, which consisted of wooden picnic tables on a street level patio.

When we arrived, we were seated and our waiter was over shortly thereafter.  I asked if they had lemonade or iced tea. Was told no. Asked if they had diet coke..was told yes. Waiter came back and said they only had coke and sprite. One of my dining companions asked what type of juice they had...and the waiter responded ""orange/mango, or strawberry lemonade"". Um...didn't I ask if they had lemonade? Anyways, it was $4 for something which I drank in about 4 gulps.

We were then told that wine was half price...so one of us ordered a white Pinot. A small glass of white Pinot...half off...came to $8/glass. So normally it would be $16? If that's the case, it's highway robbery.

On to the food.
Person one ordered the ""new"" burger...as its new to the menu. The person who had this said it was ok...but not worth the price. He said the fries were excellent.

Person 2 ordered the fish and chips...it came with coleslaw (according to the menu, their famous coleslaw). The fish was not identified on the menu but he believes it was haddock, a much cheaper cut of fish. The person who had this said it was over battered. 

2 of us had the pasta of the day.....lemon/bacon/onion in a cream sauce. It came with kernels of corn, which I opted not to have and my niece asked for on the side.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a pasta dish in my life. The bacon, while having a nice smokey flavour, was mostly fat, so it was inedible. I could barely taste any hint of lemon....and the portion size was far too small for a $16 price point. The pasta. Fresh though.

Dinner for 4, with the above food items, with 3 glasses of wine (half off), 1 juice, 1 sprite, 6 beers, tax, tip, came to over $160. Completely not worth it.

Honestly it was super rich and flavourful and delicious and is a really unique dish, which is why I would recommend trying it!

Friday, 7/2, i get a call from Pinnacle. the guy says, ""I called about your visit and your service report. Looks like you have an oil leak and some engine work that needs to be done."" and when I asked about further info he tells me he's not in the service dept do didn't have all the info. WHAT? Maybe if you call a customer talking of car problems you should know what's up rather than just trying to get them back in.

I'm thinking, ""Oil Leak?"" - ""Engine Work?"" - Could be possible major things (since I told them I was going on a road trip), how come I wasn't told when i had the car in for the oil change? Why wait almost a month to call a customer and tell them something like this? You took time to wash it - maybe give me the report.

Just another example of either poor follow through or... a scam? Since my car runs great, good mileage, AND my garage shows no sign of any oil leak. I'm a simple guy, I run on facts, logic, reason and appreciate good and TIMELY service. PLUS.. within 30 minutes after my oil change i had gone to Wilhelm for some maintenance engine work and they found nothing wrong (and the work they did could NEVER have been discovered doing an oil change)

I found myself telling the guy (nicely) i wasn't happy with my last visit and I'd never darken their doorstep again even after I'd bought two cars there. Just something about this place that isn't professional and smooth any more. It's a little thing but... even the little oil change reminder sticker was slapped in crooked and sloppily - Sorry Pinnacle... Just telling it like it is.",2016-07-03 16:56:24

We ordered the mango rolls as an app and they were delicious! The sweet and sour sauce with crushed peanuts was a great addition. I ordered the tofu pad Thai and loved it! I even had some spicy sauce on the side to add and it was nice adjusting the heat to my liking. I had enough left to create a meal for home! My mom ordered the eggplant scallop dish. She loved the scallops and vegetables covered in a really great sauce! We would definitely go back - try not to go around 6ish on a Friday night. It was packed!

After my beloved iPhone 5 got stolen in Warsaw (that's Poland, not Wisconsin), I toughed it out with my old, hot pink Motorola Razr until my contract expired.  It was withdrawal at it finest.  No, worst.  You can't go home again.  And then I waited, and waited until someone, and that would be Best Buy, had a 64GB in stock - and a good deal.  Alas, the phone was totally *&^%$'d up, and after hours on the phone troubleshooting, a wise Senior Adviser advised what could have saved a bunch of time, and that is, get a new phone.

With visions of Town Square not dancing in my head, I set off to the new Apple store, and found a parking spot immediately despite the holiday season.  It took THREE hours to transfer all my stuff to the new phone, but the Genius assigned to me, Joe, stayed with me the whole time.

When you walk in your immediately greeted by a host(s) and there's a choice of sitting at the bar or table service.

I chose the bar and Scott was my host.

The whole restaurant has a nice vibe to it, I love the idea of playing vinyl records to give a nice nostalgic feel. 

In the next room over is a huge wine display room, so for those of you who love wine may want to check this joint out.

The menu selection is simple & all small plates. If you're like me & travel alone, this is great portion wise so the meal is a la cart and perfect for one person.

The Mac and cheese is amazing! It's creamy with little crunchy it of croutons to give it a bit of contrast and texture.

The best thing was the pork belly. 

My first bite reminded of that scene in Ratatouille where the food critic takes a bite and is immediately transcended to a younger period where he was a child and experienced that same first bite.

That's how I felt when I had the pork belly. The blend of flavors took me back to a memory of growing up where I had those exact flavors.

To end it all up, I had the butterscotch cream dessert. Almost like a brÃ»lÃ©e where the hard sugar is in the form of a toffee/brittle style cookie.

Such an amazing place & if I'm ever back in town, I hope to relive the experience.

Enjoy!

Service was great. Our server kept the drinks coming and was really patient with our group of 10 (including children).

I had the chicken tacos for $11 and they substituted the beans with extra rice. It was a bit spicy, which was not mentioned in the menu. The rice was good, but I think the tacos at Del Taco taste better. Their tacos only cost $2 each.

The fried ice cream was pretty good. The strawberries in it were fresh & the ice cream was creamy. It wasn't too die for though.

I believe the Holly Madison and David Cassidy ones are real because they haven nothing better to do but all the others look like something they ordered from a fan club through the mail. I started out with garlic knots that were very good but I could only handle like 3 of the 6 because there was so much garlic under the bread. If the side of red sauce that came with it had flavor then I think they would have went down better but just by themselves it is a lot to take. My wife liked them but felt the same way about the sauce. I ordered an Italian sandwich for dinner and it was decent. I wanted extra cheese that ended up costing $.60 more but that was cool by me. My wife enjoyed her soup but thought her pasta dish lacked flavor. Sauce is everything and if the sauce isn't good it limits what you can order at a place like this. I assume that a majority of people come here for pizza and pasta so I don't know maybe it's just me but the sauce needs some vavoom. My wife did sample some pizza and really enjoyed it.

Unfortunately the flight was delayed (surprise, surprise) and I was going to cancel the reservation, if not for the fact that the husband got extremely upset and insisted that we find out the latest they can fit us in.  Turns out that they were able to move us to 10.45PM, so we took that spot and rolled the dice.

We landed at 10.15 and went straight to Stripsteak, carry ons and everything, just so he got his Stripsteak fix.

One bite into the duck fat fries (served with three different sauces, my favorite being garlic aioli) and the rib cap (the best, fattiest part of the ribeye steak) I understood why he was so noticeably upset at the prospect of not being able to make this dinner. 

The steak was the most amazing cut I've ever had - it was a relatively small piece (about 7 - 8 oz), but gosh, the meal was satisfying! It's not like digging into a hunk of meat, the fat was intertwined with the muscle so as to give the beef a soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture.  

Equally fantastic were the the foie gras sliders (more, please!!!!!!) and beef shabu shabu (similar to the one served at the SF's Michael Mina) as appetizers, and beignets with creme brÃ»lÃ©e as dessert.  But if you're only allowed to order one thing, it has to be the rib cap.",2011-11-30 15:07:47

I don't know what is going on and why sushi buffets are so insanely busy on weeknights now?  The restaurant is pretty big but it was a full house with people waiting to be seated in the wait area.  We used to dine here when it was Tako Sushi but haven't been since it switched to Matsuda.  

We were seated right away which was nice.  They put us in a room near the front....which I thought was nice at first.  But no one was looking after this area.  Literally no one came in to check on us and take our orders.  I had to run out to the main restaurant and drag a server into the room to take our order after sitting there for 30 mins.  Then because we had a large group and a large order, I think the kitchen and sushi chefs pushed out all the small orders first.  It was another 30 mins before our food trickled out when smaller tables that arrived after us were eating way before us.  

We were all starving by that point so polished off the food in like 5 mins.  We put in another order.  I of course had to run outside and drag the waiter into the room again.  We made a bigger order this time since we were still starving and it takes so long between orders.  We waited another 30 mins and they brought out 3 bowls of mussels with 4 mussels in each bowl which worked out to 1 mussel each person.  Then another 15 mins later....another small order comes out.  By that time we were all tired and cranky so didn't feel like eating anymore.  We asked them to cancel the majority of our order.  We then asked for dessert.  Had to wait another 20 mins to bring out ice cream.  Wtf? We figured it was pre scooped! By that time the restaurant cleared out.  We were the last ones there.  I think 2 seatings ate and left.  We all left tired and still hungry after a 4 hour marathon of a weeknight meal.  Wasn't cheap either for about $30 a person.  The food that we did eat was good which is the only reason for the 2 stars.  Sushi and sashimi was fresh.  The service was just incredibly slow and they didn't even make an effort to check in on us at all.  It was really annoying having to run around the restaurant to drag people in to take our orders, refill our water and tea because we were parched and the orders took forever and didn't come out right.

I know not to store them together. The last time I bought onions I purchased them separately,( because I noticed the bagged onions and potatoes ALWAYS had one rotten piece in them, which makes the rest go rotten). Not two days later, the onions were completely black with some type of mold. It's not just root vegetables either. I bought cucumbers that I put into the crisper in my fridge. Couple days later I went to grab it and it was mush. 
So now this brings me to this. A couple of weeks ago, ( I just had no time to post this until today), I bought a family pack bone in pork chops. I brought them home to divide into portions. When I opened the cellophane, the smell was so bad. The chops were green underneath the first layer. My husband took them back and they gave him another pack. I opened them and again pork chops were smelly and green. I'm honestly going to try Albertsons or even Walmart. I probably won't go back.",2017-10-27 00:56:29

Real ice cream! Petersen's is a really cool place and it's brand new! Just opened 11/23 I think. Well they have lots of great flavors like Georgia Peach, NY Black Cherry, Cappuccino, Peppermint with real peppermint, lots of sorbet, lots of chocolate stuff that I didn't want to try, and old favs like cookie dough, butter pecan etc. 

They also sell pints and also gallons I think! 

The staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop. I think the girl said they originated in Chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location! I just thought that was so cool! She also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors! I thought that was pretty rad. 

Anyway, if you are in old town I highly recomend you check this place out!",2012-12-04 16:20:38

The AC is a building that holds a 200m track in the field house, a weight room (Strength and Conditioning Centre) loaded with weights and various (new) machines, large change rooms, several gyms, squash courts, pools of various sizes, gymnastic gym, fencing room, dance studio, and even a Starbucks.

You can come in and use the facilities are your leisure, go to drop-in programs that range from yoga to zumba to cardio boxing. You can also register for courses (however this is an additional fee).

Change rooms are located in the basement. You can buy lockers which automatically gives you towel service too or you can just buy the towel service. There are also many ""day lockers"" you can use. 

Now for some random tips

- if you are a female that doesn't feel comfortable working out in the weight room in front of guys, check out the weight room's women-only hours, they vary depending on the day of the week

- when swiping to get past the turnstiles, swipe your care with the stripe facing the left side

- there are ellipticals in the field house, make sure you sign-up for them on the sign-up page directly behind the machines

- some stall showers in the women's change room do not have hot water, only semi-warm water

- last but not least, have fun!",2012-02-01 05:43:32

We've since been back a few times to celebrate anniversaries and what not's.  Aside from the creepy maitre'd at this location, who later turned into a joke, this was a wonderfully romantic first date place.  I mean come on, I married the guy!

The decor in this location is simple, with an Italian flair and enough elegance to make you think you should dress up.  You don't really have to, but you wouldn't look out of place if you did.  The first time we came here, I ordered the Tortellini Panna Rosa and it was delicious.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat filling inside was super tasty.  The rosa sauce was creamy and tangy, providing the perfect complement to the pasta.  Everything was wonderful.

On our second trip back, I ordered the Chicken Fiorentina.  Wow!  It is so good.  The chicken was juicy and tender, but the sauce.  OMG the sauce is incredible.  It is called a cognac cream sauce, but they made as well call it ambrosia.  It's incredibly rich and full bodied with a thick texture that perfectly covers your chicken.  Order that if you ever go there.

The last time I remember going I wanted to get something with that delicious sauce, but I wanted to try something new.  I think I was at the Glendale location, but I can't remember.  It was a seafood pasta with the same sauce and it too was just as wonderful as everything else I have ever had here.

If you want really good Italian food and you can afford to open your wallet a little wider than the average person, go here.  If you want a romantic date, I suggest this location over the others, it's much smaller and more intimate.  A great overall experience that keeps this restaurant in my top 10.",2009-03-05 17:29:46

unfortunately, the service was sub-par, to put it nicely. when we arrived, we were seated promptly; however, when the waitress came by for our orders(about 10 minutes later), we told her we'd need another minute. well...10-15 minutes ticked by, as we watched several more tables seated, and a couple of orders taken.

finally, a different waitress came by and took our orders. Jamie had the fried cream cheese jalapenos, and the Spicy Crunch roll, while I ordered the edamame(to share), the Hibachi Seaweed Salad, and the white tuna carpaccio.

Jamie's orders came within a reasonable amount of time, as did the edamame. I had to wait considerably longer for the salad(a big disappointment; a lump of greasy seaweed on top of a huge pile of oily lettuce), and my carpaccio came out 20 minutes or so after Jamie had finished his second course. completely unacceptable. Jamie also had to stop the waitress to ask for his soda to be refilled, after she walked past his empty glass several times.

the one bright point? my carpaccio was fresh and delightful. I ordered it with the sauce on the side, which was definitely a good idea, as it was pure sesame and chili oils, and the spice and oil would have swamped the delicate flavor of the fish itself.

we'll return, but only in the middle of a non-holiday weekday, hoping for much better service than we received this past Monday.",2011-02-16 07:49:06

Not sure what Skillets the other 2 reviewers have eaten at, but this place was EXTREMELY underwhelming. I get that the place had only been open a few days before, but there's no excuse for slow service when the place isn't crowded, no excuse for an undercooked omelet skillet (nothing I hate more than crunchy broccoli), no excuse for watery coffee, and no excuse for a waitstaff that doesn't have a clue.

And one strawberry, two grapes, and a tiny orange slice DO NOT make for a fruit cup. I get more fruit at Chik-Fil-A, folks.

Breakfast options are very unimaginative. If I wanted two eggs sunny side up with bacon and toast, I'd just make it at home and spare myself the trip. There are better places in town for a decent breakfast; Skillets ain't one of them.",2010-11-22 20:30:43

Service wise it was great. The server was very friendly and helpful and checked in often to ensure we were doing ok. They even came around and let us sample one of their pasta dishes.

It lived up to the hype in my opinion for sure! 

I went with the burrito. Got shrimp and chicken, beans, rice, salsa, guacamole. The shrimp were huge inside. There probably weren't many of them (maybe 3 jumbo) but it gave it great crunch and nice added flavor in my opinion. 

The guacamole was on the side and it was creamy. I generally prefer a little chunky guac but it was still very tasty and had grape tomato halves in it. 

On top, I had the salsa rojo which is supposed to have a little kick but did not have much of one in my opinion. I generally like spicy but what it lacked in kick it carried in flavor. 

The service was great. I realize that where new places often struggle is with their service. This was not the case at Bandito's. Our server was great, the other staff regularly filled my water. The manager came over to ask us how we were doing and then even removed some finished plates from the table. 

The place is very nicely decorated. They have a beautiful mural on the wall! Some nice soft music and great ambience. 

The burritos were about $18 a piece which is a little bit on the high side for a lunch outing but it's a nicer place so that's more accepted I guess.

I found the representatives very friendly, especially in fingerprinting and photo. They were detailed oriented and very professional, but at the same time they were cordial and nice. We joked a bit. 

I really have a problem with the amount of people here. They closed the other fingerprinting location. WHY? I was number 15 in line at 7:45 am and I did not leave until 11 am. There were people STANDING because there were not enough seats to accommodate everyone.

We arrived with friends of ours who were treating us to dinner. They had a reservation and had to tell 2 different hosts this fact before we were led to the dining room. Ooops! There's no 4-top open in the dining room. So back we go to the front to wait. Then they basically stole two 2-tops from a big group and made a table for us from scratch. But there really wasn't room for it so we were basically sitting out in the middle of a walkway and on top of two other tables. My chair was so uncomfortably close to a lady from another table that she actually got up and moved to the other side of the table. 

We were never offered water even after our server finally noticed us and were asked what we'd like to drink but were never brought a drink/beer menu. Overall very clueless, inattentive service.

The food: 
Two of us got the fish fry - I'm always in search of a good fish fry and usually never find it. Not here either. It was haddock which was breaded and fried but the fish was very overcooked - it shouldn't have the texture of meat. Green beans were undercooked - I like 'em a little crunchy as much as the next guy but these were borderline raw. Fries were decent but nothing amazing. 

One of the guys got the Porky Pie pizza which he said was pretty good and the other got the special which was 'smoked beer can chicken mac and cheese'. It did sound good and it came out looking pretty awesome. We all tried it and it was tasty, but for me it would be WAY too rich for a main dish and I probably could only have eaten a quarter of the plate. 

Overall, this place was not so great which sucks because we've been to the Beach Club Bistro several times and had very good experiences there. Three stars is generous for this trip given the really crappy service and underwhelming food.",2013-12-08 18:52:19

I ordered tacos, chicken, pork and carne asada.   I got an enchillada for the girls. 

The girls didn't like the enchilada and the sauce seemed pretty boring and kind of sweet.

The rice was about as plain as could be, but the beens were kind of special.  They were closer to straight pinto beans then refried beans.  The were lightly mashed with plenty of bean chunks in a light sauce.  The bean flavor was strong.  The girls liked the beans mixed with rice and I enjoyed the beans and mexican cheese.

The chicken taquito was the best of the bunch.  The marinated pork took second but was a little dry.  The carne asada brought up the bottom.  It had a bit of a gassy taste and was far behind the great carne asada at El Sol.

After being examined by a doctor, she was asked if she thought that she should go home or stay overnight. This seems an odd question, as I would think that the doctor should be the one to determine this. She was feeling a little better, so chose to go home, and was given a prescription to fill the next day. When I went to pick-up the prescription the following day, the pharmacist informed me that he could not fill it as it could be harmful for her due to another medication that she takes regularly (which was on the list that she gave to the doctor). The pharmacist attempted several times to contact the hospital to figure out how to proceed, but he was first told to fax over the prescription in question, then was told several more times that someone would look at it but this never seemed to happen. After almost 4-hr of waiting, the pharmacist called again before he closed for the day, and was told that the emergency doctor was not even there that day, but someone else would call him back shortly. Eventually, the doctor that called agreed to send a new prescription for an alternate medication that the pharmacist had to suggest himself. In summary, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!! The doctor clearly was at fault for prescribing the wrong medication, and nobody else seemed interested enough to correct this mistake.

But a great thanks to the pharmacist who did his best (and I will post a positive review for him at Shoppers Drug Mart - Bayview Village Mall).",2018-02-24 04:41:32

Figured if they are having a customer appreciation night ($11 AYCE) the food must have gotten better - WRONG. Eel tasted bad, fish on other rolls tasted funky, other rolls that were supposed to be mildly spicy were burn your mouth off hot so much that we couldn't even eat it (they did take it back no questions asked though so 1 point for them), so much rice on rolls they were hard to eat, Tempura in rolls seemed as it was pre-made & sitting in a steamer somewhere to keep warm as it wasn't crispy or warm as it would be if it came right out of the fryer into the making of your roll & to top that off had shell & fish bones in one of my rolls. Out of the 5 rolls that we got only 1 of them I liked (Dave roll was the winner). Actually was surprised that the nigri was fresh tasting after the experience with a couple of rolls.

Service was extremely bad as well. Ordered 3 items right away took 10 minutes to get 1st 2 then another 45 min to get the 3rd. At the start of the night the waiters were hounding the second we walked in the door about we wanted before we even had a chance to look @ the menu then after a while (still not that busy) seriously had to trip a waiter to get some service. Could have walked out w/o paying it took that long to get the bill (25-30min). . Count yourself lucky if you didn't go & next month when they run this promo JUST SAY NO! To me the $11 wasn't worth it. Would have rather paid $15 for 2 items total instead of AYCE at a better place (like Island Sushi where they have 1/2 off all rolls Mon-Wed all day).

So, driving by Gelato 64 for years because it is right next to Lee Lee's, I decided it would be in my best interests to try it out. If I didn't, my asian citizenship might have been taken away.

There are now only 2 places that come to my mind when I want gelato. Angel Sweets and Gelato 64. By far, these are the two best places for gelato. There isn't even a contest.

The strawberry cheesecake had an amazing texture that was somehow gelato and still had remnants of cheesecake. It was a perfectly well done recipe with the perfect amount of sweetness and just a hint of tartness from the strawberries.

Double fudge chocolate brownie was also mind bogglingly delicious. Again, the texture was perfected to give your mouth an explosion that would rival the creation of the universe. The brownie 'chunks' were sized perfectly and it made every small bite a pleasure to have.

If I could give a zero star rating I would.  I play a lot of poker across the country, and this is by far THE worst run room anywhere in the US. 90% of the dealers are not customer friendly. They have to pool their tips so there is no incentive for individual dealers to give good service. I tip the minimum just because I feel sorry for the dealer not because of the service. They have cancelled  to host a WSOP circuit event twice in last two years. In my opinion, it is because they don't want to spend the money and effort since they don't want to cater to poker players. I don't understand this as the poker market in Cle and NEO is huge. The rake they charge and the promotions they run for poker are embarrassing. I get more rewards and promotions at other casinos I have to travel to that cater to poker players. Lastly their daily tournament structures are bad. Little value in playing them in my opinion.

Trails can range from 0.70 mile to 3 miles around trip.  You can spend a whole day while the sun is up and then head back to vegas to enjoy the night life.

My favorite is hanging around the red rock canyon.  I highly recommend the Calico Trail I, Calico Trail II, and Calico Tank Trail which run along the red rock canyon.  Calico Trail I is more flat area of the canyon which is an easy hike.  But it was closed due to construction for parking and the pavement.   Calico Trail II is a 1-2 hours hike down into the red canyon.  I would rate this hike more easy-moderate.  Its requires less climbing compared to Calico Tank.   Calico Tank is a moderate hike that requires a lot of climbing of the red rocks.  It's quite fun if you are adventurous and ready to get down and use all 4 limbs.   This is a 3.5-4 hour hike depending on your experience level.",2017-01-03 02:20:48

With all the hype on yelp and my friends raving about this place, I immediately jumped on it like a fat kid on a cake. After giving this place few more visits, my verdict is: it's not that great.

SERVICE
Service is consistently amazing here. Dennis, Sou and Louis really goes the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your drinks. It is nice to know that customer satisfaction is their number one priority. Two thumbs up for their service.

DRINK
When you are handed a drink personally, they tell you to let them know if you need any adjustments. Even though their willingness to adjust your drink is appreciated, I find that drinks are not that great when you have to keep making adjustments. Or when they offer many options and varieties of drinks but you only like one drink. 

I have tried their oolong latte, jasmine milk tea, hokkaido milk tea, cantaloupe milk tea, sunset on the beach slush and black tea latte so far. Out of all the drinks I did get to try, I only ever liked and will only order their jasmine milk tea which is sad to say. Their drinks just never really blows my mind like every other reviewers says. 

Too picky? Possibly. It's all a personal preference? True. But all the high praise and rave about this place is ridiculous to me. It's overrated. 

Let's talk about boba. Boba is inconsistent. It's on the softer side, sometimes too soft and mushy. They use longan honey for their boba which is nice, but can get too sweet. Honey from boba will dissolve in drink. Perhaps asking them to rinse the boba is a good choice. 

CONCLUSION
Personally after trying +5 drinks, I can safely say this place isn't really my cup of tea.",2015-08-19 18:02:31

Great setting in a Victorian house with a well lit dinning area and a neat little bar.

Ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer which was very good and came with seasoned and lightly fried pita chips. They also brought out a wonderful basket of fresh baked bread.

For my lunch entrÃ©e I opted to get the special soup and half sandwich which was cream of tomato with basil and a meatloaf sandwich on ciabatta. The soup was excellent, just creamy enough without being overly unctuous and with the right amount of basil to compliment the preparation. 

The sandwich was also very good as the meatloaf was moist and flavorful and was topped with frizzled onions, homemade slaw and melted cheese on a toothsome ciabatta roll. It came with some seasoned, house made chips which were excellent.

I wanted to wait until I had enough experiences here to accurately give a review.  My current workout routine is generally every morning between 6am and 8am.  One of the main reasons I signed up here was because I was told they limit the number of active memberships to keep from overcrowding.  During the time I am working out, there is usually between 3-5 others working.  This may not seem like a lot, but I also came once in the afternoon and once on a Saturday and both times the place was not crowded, so I am happy with that so far.  The equipment is top notch.  They have a good variety of machines, treadmills, and free weights.  You can work on pretty much anything you want.  I am mostly working on muscle gain and I love the weight machines as well as all the free weights they have available.  It's nice that I don't have to fight over machines with others due to some overcrowding.  I also like that they have private shower rooms, 1 for men, and one for women.  It would be better if they had at least 2 shower rooms because I have run into situations where a shower isn't available and I risk being late for work.  It's a little expensive to workout here, but for me it's worth it due to the small number of people here on a daily basis.  It's also a prime location for me since work is just down the street.  They also have a good security measure here that keep people who do not belong out, and allows members to workout safely.",2013-10-04 18:11:49

Minnie's tail was wagging the second her paws were in the store... I was excited too!  We went in to check this place out after seeing some of the previous Yelp reviews.

Wag N' Wash has anything and everything you could ever desire if you were a dog... adorable and comfy designer dog beds, great quality collars, leashes, food bowls, toys, balls, wet food, dry food, packaged treats, bones, and all-natural pet biscuits made fresh in the store daily!  Even more exciting... real live cats in the store!

Needless to say, Minnie and I took our time walking up and down each and every aisle examining all of these fun products.  After round 1 of picking up a toy and some treats, I asked Steve (the owner who was working at the time) for some advice on which wet food he recommends I use to make Minnie's dry food more appealing.  Steve personally walked me back to show me the different varieties that he thought Minnie would like.  I could tell he knew a lot about the products and it made me feel even better about what I was about to purchase.

Back up to the register we walked... this time with my hands full of all kinds of goodies for Minnie.  Steve rang us up and when he learned that Minnie and I were both Wag N' Wash virgins, he set us up with a VIP (Very Important Pet) Card... which gives us 10% off of every visit and $10 back when we reach $300.  That may take awhile, but we're on our way having spent almost $50 today... and that's before we've even attempted part 2 - the Wash!

I have come here before a couple of times, and have always enjoyed my food and the pomp and circumstance.  I had however, never brought a child with me.  Now that I have a grandson, we do take him everywhere and expose him to as much as we can.  (it's what I did with my kids too).  I really didn't think it was going to be an issue.  We made reservations early, we were there at opening.  The hostess was happy and very accommodating.  She asked if he was allowed to color, and I said yes, but he doesn't understand the concept of paper and would draw on your tablecloth.  She responded with that is quite alright.  We don't do the laundry ourselves, anyways.  I thought WOW, they are really accommodating.  

She brought my grandson, the crayons and the paper.  We had been introduced to our server, I believe a Mrs. Bender.  She was all business and IMMEDIATELY corrected my grandson for drawing on the tablecloth and took away his crayons.  With a tisk tisk.  Between her and another server, there was a lot of eye rolling going on.  They were not happy that a child was at THEIR table.  I was very offended by all this, but because we were someone else's guest and I didn't want to upset her, I stayed quiet.

First off, the clientele is ahhh....interesting.  As we pulled up, the crowd exiting looked like they were surely leaving to get a fix somewhere.  Made me a little leary.  Then the hostess, a cute girl, had pretty much full arm sleeves on both arms.  Everyone in sight was dressed in head to toe black and clearly spent enough on tattooing to fund a small nation.  Given that we just hopped out of our minivan and had two young kids with us, I wasn't too sure.  But, the more I looked I saw a few polo shirts in the crowd, heard a few kids squawking and felt a bit at ease.  Near the end of our meal, an older couple was seated next to us looking like they had skipped the country club mixer to eat some grease at The Diamond - she even asked for the wine list (ha!) - so it's definetly an ecclectic blend.

Anyway, on the good stuff.  I LOVE fried pickles.  The Diamond's pickles were awesome!!!  Lightly battered, very tangy pickles, served hot out of the fryer.  A fried pickle is all about the pickle after all, so you better use a tasty one.   The only problem is that the ranch dressing they served them with was downright NASTY!  It was way too thick - pretty much the consistency of straight mayo - with very little seasoning and lumpy.  I didn't even realize it was supposed to be ranch until my side salad arrived and I realized it matched the ranch dressing with my salad.  Ranch dressing is seriously easy to make, there is no excuse for that scary stuff.  We also ordered some hushpuppies and they were really, really good.  Probably the best I have had around here.  Nice lightly corny batter and lightly fried.  I find most places around here cook the puppies 'til they are almost black and that's not really my thing.  

The menu is pretty extensive, much more so than we expected.  That almost worried me because I feel the best restaurants are those with a very clear focus.  This menu is not terribly focused.  My son ordered the homemade corndog and it was delish.  Think state fair corndog - fresh fried and yummy.  Hubs had a chili dog which was somewhat ordinary looking, but the dog itself was super tasty.  I ordered the crab cakes, which were surpisingly very crabby with not too much filler.   I was a little unsure of ordering them, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the mac n'cheese for a side and it was very, very cheddary and rich, but good.  

Our waitress was pleasant and efficient and the food arrived quickly.  No complaints AT ALL about service or wait time.  If you are looking for a break from the TGIFridays of the world, The Diamond is a good bet.  It would be a fun place to take out of town guests, etc.   We will be back.",2011-03-20 15:54:44

There is a counter to order hot dogs and then a separate counter for sandwiches and fries, so it's hard to time your food if you're getting different things. My boyfriend's hot dog was ready at least 8-10 minutes before my burger and fries. He said it was one of the best hot dogs he's ever had, while I was not nearly as impressed with my burger. Overpriced and overcooked beef with an overcooked egg was very disappointing.

Grassy areas to sit and chill or play with your pup or young'uns. I saw dozens of bees in the gardens. BEES!

Coming back to reminisce my high school memories, I was utterly disappointed. Yelp had turned my taste palate into a diva ! 

Once seated and ordered, we were brought a dozen of starters like soup, salad, congee (random, I know!), fried salmon, tofu and edamame beans. Once my food came I understood why they gave away so much free apps.

On the menu, Order J looked like it had everything I craved: assorted sushi, sashimi, tempura , and maki rolls..... But what came on my plate was 8 pieces of pre frozen salmon, 4 pieces of California roll, and a hand roll. My friend ordered something completely different and he got the exact same stuff. Nothing on my plate even remotely looked like the food I thought I ordered. The tempura was definitely the worse I've ever had. There was zero panko batter. Just a small piece of fried shrimp.

You'd spend 12$ here ... Why not spend the extra 5$ to get yourself some quality sushi ?

I'd give one star... But because it is so damn cheap, I guess that's one thing you have to sacrifice : quality.",2015-04-29 00:40:06

I've been to chow here a number times and the food is relatively consistent.  For the money, go for the pork shank, lamb or short ribs.  Those are my go-to dishes when dining here.  Unfortunately, they're also a little hit or miss.  On my last visit, the short ribs were dry and not as fork tender as it should be.  At $30+ for the entrees, I would expect a lot better execution.  

To wash it down, you can check out their extensive wine list.  I love the organization of it: by varietal and, subsequently, ascending by price.  I can't count the number of times I've had to hunt through a binder for bargains.  Here, I can just figure out my price range and hunt each varietal until I find something. 

I've never ordered any of the appetizers, though they all look good.  But no, I save myself for the deserts.  Well, the bread pudding to be specific.  This is probably a top 5 bread pudding for me.  So rich and tasty I could make a meal out of it.  

Now, other than eating a meal or desert, you could come here just for the popcorn.  Orville Redenbacher got nuthin on this stuff.  Caramel, bacon and chocolate.  This is the kind of stuff I LIVE for.  If you're visiting from out of town, pay the $7 and buy a bag to eat on the plane (and watch your neighbors drool).

They also used to make a P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L bacon peanut brittle.  The bacon peanut brittle is, quite simply, a necessary addition to anyone's diet.  I've had the walnut bacon brittle, and while tasty in and of itself, is simply not as good as the peanut version.  My last two visits they didn't have any, but I intend to bang on their door every time I'm in Scottsdale just to check.  They're lucky I don't live in Scottsdale anymore or else they'd make some just to get rid of me.

ydDCGLcNnJv2Z2uoX6vx3Q,KSJsYufhtilYfxcteB5dGg,3hmoQIAUaYF9u_QaxfjwwQ,2,2,2,1,"As a first-time customer to the establishment, I was looking forward to celebrating my boyfriend's birthday by taking him to watch the UFC fight, which they were featuring on pay per view.  My boyfriend and his buddy arrived early (about an hour before I did), just so he could be sure that we would have good seats (the ONLY thing he wanted for his birthday was to see this fight).  I made sure to let the server know that we were celebrating his birthday (discreetly, I wanted him to be surprised).  We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers; shortly thereafter two more friends joined us at our table.  After finishing our appetizers and a second round of drinks, we were approached by a different female server (or hostess), who asked us if we were staying to watch the fight and if so, we would have to pay $9 each.  We were startled because we were not informed of this (none of us, even though we arrived separately), but we obliged and asked that it be added to our checks.  About 5 minutes later, another staff member approached us and asked us if  we had paid to watch the fight (we told her yes and showed her our wristbands).  5 minutes later, yet a third staff member interrupted to ask if we had paid to watch.  At this point, we were beginning to get a bit ruffled because their tone was almost accusatory and we were paying customers.  The real kicker occurred when a security guard approached the table immediately after to inform us that our table had been reserved and that unfortunately we would have to move.  We were completely taken aback (we had ordered 2 rounds of drinks at this point, 2 appetizers, and were deciding on entrees--we were essentially mid-meal).  There were no ""Reserved"" signs on our table when we were seated (in fact, the table the security guy moved us to had the Reserved sign posted on it).  I found it ironic that they requested us to pay for our tickets multiple times AND THEN made sure to inform us that we would have to then move.  In all fairness, the table they moved us to wasn't in a terrible spot, but the one we had initially claimed was much better for viewing purposes (no craning our necks) and it was a roomier booth for the 4 of us.  That and the fact that I was trying to make it special for my boyfriend's birthday and thus far, the customer service had been less than stellar (no issues on the food side, however, the food was fantastic!).  It was more the lack of consideration/communication that detracted from what would have been an otherwise enjoyable experience.  We changed tables; at which point the servers cleared our waters (and two of the gals' soft drinks), after which we had to request more (when, in an ideal world, they should have been replenished immediately--I never did receive my water until after we had ordered our entrees and completely finished them (maybe I should have spoken up and said something sooner, but it's merely an observation, since I had already ordered a water to accompany my rounds of beer).  Same with the silverware and napkins--the staff cleared ours and when they made us change tables, then proceeded to serve us our meals with no utensils or napkins ( my boyfriend asked the runner, ""May we please have some silverware?""  and she literally grabbed one set, placed it next to him and took off before he could explain that we all needed silverware).  Our female server was very sweet and asked us multiple times if there was anything else we needed, but my point is that due to the inconvenience of changing tables, we should not have to request the basic necessities for a second time when they were already on our table the first time around--it really took away from the experience.  At the end of the night, the tab for just my boyfriend and I totaled over $100 (there were 4 in our party, and the others spent a good deal on drinks and entrees as well).  The bottom line is that although this restaurant has excellent American-style food, we did not feel that our business was appreciated here and we would rather spend our time and money elsewhere.  As a side note,  they apparently don't do anything for birthdays as most establishments do--or they forgot--because it was never acknowledged by the staff, not even a ""Happy Birthday!""  :-(",2015-01-04 17:14:32

I ordered fish and chips and got my order in about 10 minutes. Not bad considering I saw that there was only 3 ladies operating this place. But I knew for next time to call ahead. 
Side note: The server did not seem to know how to pack takeout out, the sauce containers were all over the place on the bottom of the bag with the box sitting on top - one was malt vinegar and I worried about it leaking.

Got back to the office, opened the fish and chips, looked good, but everything looked greasy, probably because they tried to rush this order out from the deep fryer to the box. I got 2 pieces of fish and a bed a fries. Not my favourite fish and chips but typically what one would get in a restaurant.

Had lunch again this week and it was a bit of a disaster this time around. I called in my order and was told that it would be 10-15 minutes. I got there 15 minutes later. The server apologized that it would take a little longer. I was there for about another 10 minutes. She offered me a free drink of my choice, I got a soda. Finally, my order was ready and I was happy to go. 
Side note: There was only one table occupied .

Got back to the office, opened my big breakfast to find that many items were missing that were detailed in the description. I did not see any french toast and beans, and I was missing an egg. I can only assume that the kitchen staff doesn't have their menu memorized and that the server doesn't check the boxes before closing them. I called them back immediately but got their voicemail instead. 

I'm still waiting to see what will come out of this. *sighs

ETA:

I received a call back the day after and spoke with the GM, Robert, who offered me a complimentary meal to make up for their mistakes. I love good customer service. :)

They specialize in mid- to high-end products (don't believe the other reviewer -- she got it wrong). They also carry food for birds, rodents, and horses, but I can't vouch for their selection for these animals. The prices are fantastic -- bagged food is always several dollars cheaper than Petco/Petsmart, and canned food is sometimes as much as a dollar cheaper per can. Pet Club staff are far more knowledgable about pet nutrition and food options than the big stores.

Even though they specialize in food, Pet Club carries a selection of supplies other than food, such as collars, leashes, grooming products, bowls, beds, toys, cat trees, and treats. It's not huge, but there's enough variety for most people. FInally, there is no actual club -- no membership is required.

This location is small and cramped (the majority of the location is warehouse for inventory) and not particularly clean, but the service and quality of product is great.

Their produce how is really small and they don't offer a lot of organic products either.  I believe they only have one shelf designated for organic produce compared to a whole room full of all other fruits and veggies. 

I feel the entrance to the store is far too small. Every time I walk in there I have to look out for somebody coming around the corner with the buggy or a family of people and you have to squirm your way through. And then the counter where people buy lottery tickets and cigarettes it's always full too. 

The floor in the produce section is new and up-to-date but the rest of the store looks very old. There are a few items that you can buy over-the-counter besides medicine and of course the bakery and deli but they don't have a fresh meat counter. I don't understand how you don't sell fresh meat but you sell fresh seafood, and the seafood counter is extremely small smaller than the bedroom.

I'd rather skip the store and go to the nicer giant equals like the one in Monroeville Shadyside and Robinson. This line is just far too small, far too limited and honestly it's kind of ghetto.

I had the spicy scrambled eggs with jalapeÃ±os, goat cheese, and apricot glazed ham. I really liked it but I couldn't really taste any goat cheese. I ordered it with grits and they were amazing. Cheesy, and soft, and packed with flavor. 

The bf got the blue corn waffle. It was also really good but it gets too sweet/soggy after a while. Maybe you can ask for the fruit sauce on the side.. 

The cactus pear iced tea was not as good as I expected it to be. I swapped it for OJ instead and was much better. The iced tea has a subtle pear flavor.. I'd like a fruitier version instead. 

Service was great but it was annoying to hear our server constantly being told to work faster to get people out. Her superior kept asking her what was going on with certain tables.

The bar is large with high ceilings, but it was smaller than I expected. The main problem is there is no where to sit unless you pay for a table.

The baked BBQ pork buns were tasteless and I didn't even get my favorite dim sum pastry - the egg custard tart. When we wanted to order dishes off the regular menu (due to the lack of food available for dim sum), a man who I believe is the manager walked up and told us that the kitchen did not have time to make our dishes. He said it would be at least an hour before they could cook anything for us because they were busy making dim sum. I couldn't understand how they could be busy when there was nothing coming out of the kitchen. I have to add that this guy wore a button up shirt and a tie. His tie was tucked into his shirt in between some buttons near the bottom of his shirt - so unprofessional.

It was extremely crowded, there were no tables, and the line took forever. But, okay, that's fine, I'm a patient person. I was ordering for three people- I got two biscuits- add fried eggs for $1 each, a fancy drink for me, and oatmeal plus a biscuit with jam for my husband. So we finally get to sit down and the waitress comes out and says they are out of oatmeal and asked my husband to pick something else. He gets grits and they came out first. We wait a bit and our biscuit sandwiches come out but no biscuit for him. The guy asks if we have everything and we let him know the biscuit is missing. He says he'll go get one but then he never came back. I start to eat and realize there's no egg on my sandwich. My mom says she didn't get her egg either. So we grab the waitress and tell her we still don't have my husband's biscuit and neither of us got eggs. I say it's no big deal, just bring the biscuit and can I just get my money back for the eggs. She goes ""it's only $2 dollars plus tax. Do you really care about getting $2 back?""  Ummm, yes, I do. I say that I would like my $2 back, it may only be $2 but I paid for something I didn't get. She says ""I don't think $2 is a big deal but I can get it for you, it's fine."" Hello, Rude. So she walks away and at this point I realize I'm thirsty- I never got my drink!"" So I just go inside and say I never got my drink. The cashier tells me I should have gotten it when I ordered. Okay, well I didn't, no one offered it to me or told me I needed to wait for it.

The food is quite good. The guacamole was very good. They don't quite have as many vegetarian options as I was hoping, BUT the one tofu taco that they have is incredible. I could eat a whole plate of them, so I guess it's not a huge loss for the lack of variety. My dining companion had the mushroom quesadilla and really liked that as well.

There wasn't a long wait at all and our hostess sat us within 10 minutes.  First off, the customer service here is some of the friendliest around.  We were checked on multiple times by different staff members.  Metro has a few signature items such as the Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits.  However, for my first visit here I chose the Chicken Pot Pie and, boy, was that a fabulous choice for me!  The crust is flakey and the filling is tasty.

We ended up at Blue Martini instead and enjoyed ourselves more here!

I'm not sure if it's every Saturday night, but there was a live band playing that night and they were super talented and entertaining. We each ordered the Cake Pop Martini and it was yum in a glass. The glass was rimmed with sprinkles and icing and the drink itself was delish...strong but amazing! It was funny because the girls didn't know that the little shaker cup contained more of the drink!! We shared the big fat chocolate cake slice and that too was amaze. 

Between the cake pop martini and the chocolate cake, I would say that it was the best idea for dessert after dinner. Add live music and great vibes and it was complete. 


As far as the crowd and ambience--pretty chill and fun, but there were times that I thought that I was at Stoney's instead! The live band was awesome and when they took breaks, a DJ would play some music to keep the crowd entertained.

I had another dog that went in the water once and he came out brown and smelled like sewage. They do have hoses to use to wash dogs off there though. I'm giving three stars because this park needs more places for the people to sit, and because of the yuck water in the lake area, and no drinking fountain. 

I don't get people who complain about how dogs want to play rough sometimes with other dogs. If you don't like it don't bring your dogs. There is also a separate place for ""small timid dogs.""  Dogs will quickly find their place among other dogs, even at the park, it's how they are. My big dogs run from the little ones I don't get it but I'm not going to go to the owner and ask them to control their dogs because that's dumb. 

Also please don't bring babies/toddlers here unless you're going to pay attention to them. I saw a lady leave her baby out in the dirt in the stroller and some dog started licking its toes and she paid it no mind.

I called them on a whim on a Friday, with a desire to update my eye prescription.  It had been at least 7 (!) years since my last visit, and I was growing tired of reaching for my glasses so I could see things at a distance.  They managed to fit me in for the following Monday (a mere two-day wait), and the morning appointment totally fit my schedule.

The examination was very thorough.  They scanned my old glasses to determine the prescription, took photos of my eyes, and did a variety of vision tests.  I had my eyes diluted (you can choose not to) and the staff made me feel very comfortable and cared for.  Princess Buttercup (the office dog) also made me feel very welcome and looked after.

After determining my new prescription and talking about contacts, they made an appointment for me to come in the following Monday contact lens coaching.  Once again, it was no problem to get a first-thing-in-the-morning appointment.

Today I went in totally nervous having never worn contacts before.  The staff once again made me feel very comfortable, and one of the girls sat with me and patiently waited as I tried time and time again to get the lens in and out of my eye.  After she was satisfied with my progress, she had me sit down with Dr. Heeney once again to discuss how I was feeling about the lenses (as a first time wearer).  She also imparted some warnings, tips, and tricks about wearing them.

Before I left I was given a lens case and cleaning solution, and they made another appointment to follow-up in two weeks (to make sure I'm still happy).

I can't recommend this place enough.  The office is full of great staff who take the time to make you feel comfortable and at ease.  Never once did I feel rushed or like I was getting in the way of other patients.

The price was fine too.  I paid $120 for the exam, which seems steep, but it was very comprehensive (and I won't have to have all the tests performed again the next time I go in).  The contact lens coaching was $50, but that appears to have covered not only the coaching, but my first set of lenses as well.

we SHOULD have taken the waitress' advice and ordered only off the  grill menu. we tried the bacon wrapped scallops. so. good. 

i really liked the whole decor/ambiance thing. aside from being realllllllly crowded. we liked the cleverness of the sushi menu description - one of those spiky clip ball things, and the (albeit mostly useless) river rocks.

I ordered a 14"" pizza with cheese and pepperoni.  While waiting, the server brought me three garlic knots.  They were hot and fresh but they could have used more garlic.  The knots were accompanied by a small container of hot marinara for dipping.

In a normal amount of time, another server brought me the pizza and kidded me when she realized I was dining solo.  Later she came back and asked me if I wanted her to box the rest to bring home.

The pizza was good.  I prefer thick crust pizza but this was a credible thin crust pizza with a small amount of tomato sauce and more cheese and pepperoni.

I was impressed by the staff.  They were very friendly and they realized from the get go that I was a first time customer.  I'd recommend them and I'll probably be back if I'm in the mood for thin pizza.  I also had a chance to peruse the menu and saw the Italian dinners they serve.

It is always prepared how you ask, and have never felt out of line letting a server know if something is wrong.  The service is always great, plenty of attention, bussers keep the table clean, and if any member of the staff sees that you need something, they are happy to oblige.  I have had several cuts of steak, sea bass, and most of the appetizers.  I can't think of a single thing I've ordered and not been pleased.  Although drinks are expensive, it's worth ordering a martini because they give you the shaker with almost a full refill for your glass.  As far as nice meals go, Ocean Club hits the mark on every level.

The only reason I give this specific Mastro's 3 stars is strictly personal preference of atmosphere.  This place is BUSY!!!  Possibly too busy to really enjoy a fine meal.  It's definitely a social ""place to be seen"".  Evening gowns, expensive suits and colorful characters are not uncommon.  There is a special energy to this restaurant.  But that's where it crosses the fine line of dining and a social club.  I've sat in the bar dining area at a high top and felt like a sardine.  The table is not big enough for a bottle of wine and your food.  There are so many employees that you can't really have a long conversation without being interrupted.  And there is so much traffic, you feel like someone is going to crash into you at any moment.  Again, it's only personal preference that if I'm going to drop 2 or 3 hundred on a meal, I want some space to enjoy it.  For a special occasion to connect with company, try Mastro's steak house on Pinnacle or City Hall in Scottsdale.  Exact same food, more relaxed atmosphere and room to appreciate your company and a great meal.",2016-12-19 21:13:02

Service/decor: This is a simple counter with a colorful, bright display of gelato. Nothing fancy but you can't miss it when you walk by - the gelato just beckons to you welcomingly via your peripheral vision. It's sneaky like that. In terms of service, it can be hit or miss and I attribute this to the unclear line formation situation. Because of its placement, it's hard to know where to line up so people just stand in from of the counter and the poor staff folk have to try and remember who was there first. It can take a while to place your order especially if you've got some indecisive people ahead of you. In my case, the fellow who was working greeted me, then asked the guys ahead of me if he could serve me since they were taking their sweet time in choosing a flavor. It was a quick and painless experience. 

Gelato stuff: Tons of flavors ranging from chocolate to mango. I'd say they've got about 30ish to choose from. I really enjoy it - I don't find their gelato overly sweet, but the flavors are always spot on. Chocolate-Peanut Butter: hello my love.

I was on my way and it was impossible...

This was my first visit to the Orchard, it's a very nice place in a residential neighborhood, you can easily miss it if you are speeding or distracted, they have parking lot in front and in the back, and it's surrounded by trees.

The ambience is relaxed, they have a splash pad for  the little ones, and some tables with shade.
They do also sell ice cream and drinks, breakfast all day and sandwiches-salads and chicken nuggets for the kids, but you need to make a loooong line to check out, even it they do have 2 cashiers working at the same time.

I wish they had more shade,specially on the top of the splash pad, it's very nice to enjoy the sunshine however we are in March and the sun is already ""burning"" I cannot imagine June or July temperatures...the kids are running barefoot and the have artificial grass, it was soft for me but my son complained, the paths where kids are walking have some cemented areas and rocks!!! 
The kind of rocks that are edgy and pointy...wish I could take a picture but my hands were full...
I think they definitely need to consider to improve the place making it more safe but at the same time kid friendly. Also I wish they do recycle and had separate bins I was not able to find any. 

Also when I was about to pick my drink I found they have Perrier, but the fridge was broken or just off, so it was not cold....another disappointment 


Talking now about the food, I ordered a spicy crunchy chicken sandwich with salad and a strip chicken nuggets with fries for my kid, I ordered my sandwich to go, and once I got home and opened my box I was really disappointed...
First no extra napkins, just the small thin napkins that comes with your plastic fork, also no seasonings, I found my friends who ate at the place had for them so I expected I had them included too, nope...zilch 
Then when I gave the first bite to my sandwich I found the chicken was dry and burnt..I attached  a picture of my son chicken nuggets and the chicken of my sandwich so you can compare and tell I'm not crazy haha  I figured out the chipotle color added darkness, however no...it was over fried..I understand they have many costumers and orders to fulfill, maybe not enough staff at the kitchen, maybe the person who cooked my chicken was afraid of substitution for a new one and take longer or to be charged for the one they burned...I don't know however my experience was not the one I was expecting, I felt like if I ordered some chicken sandwich from KFC and still KFC would be better because it's not burnt!
considering they do also have a restaurant next door from part of the same business, well I expected the same quality of food and service according to the place, anyway maybe next time I will visit early morning, I will keep my kid with sandals all times and I will stick with drinks instead of trying to experience tasting their food, and I will suggest you to do the same.",2018-03-23 22:21:22

The food is made-to-order and cooked up right in front of you. The cooks will even offer you samples of the chicken and steak. Both are delicious, but I think the steak is more flavorful and juicier. My friend and I aren't big steak fans, but we both chose to order the Steak Shawarma Wrap. If you're not a meat fan, you can opt for the falafel instead. In addition, we ordered a side of falafels called Falafel-Five.

Despite our giant appetites, my friend and I could barely finish our pita bread steak wraps because they're huge, but so, so GOOD! The steak wraps are stuffed with veggies and a dip of your choice. You can even spice it up a bit with some of their freshly made spicy sauces. Also, this comes with a small side of pickled carrots which nicely complement the Shawarma.

TY-d1cl4DPgax2fh6YRtvw,YORJi2JtQg5Mo4nmKOXzag,lpYFsXFrojiBZ1kbWR2lZw,5,5,8,8,"Every Tuesday night after our late night hockey games, I join a rag tag collection of heroes, misfits and misanthropes at Four Peaks Brewery in North Scottsdale for some post game gab and nosh. I love these nights. We test our aging, yet surprisingly spry bodies mano-a-mano for adult hockey league glory and bond over drinks that no one actually orders because while Karina, our beloved server, may not know our last names, she knows we're predictable.

And speaking of it, I always order a plate of fries, or hope Brad E does. They're fucking delicious. T.A.S.T.Y. Big fan. But on this one lucky night, my boy Jerry W, genius that he is, orders nachos. I think nothing of it, until they arrive. They are GORGEOUS. Seriously beautiful. A culinary specimen clearly dispatched to our table by some immaculately conceived experiment working through the now divine hand of a short order cook. The guy, or lady, is a magician with these nachos. They're like eye-crack. Or better perhaps eye-(censored) as I visually molested each chip and chunk of cheese.

But like all impurities and roadblocks in our beautiful kingdom, like a cancer on the king's nose, these nachos were covered in chicken. I'm not even going to get into that discussion, but I don't do chicken. So I couldn't eat any of what I considered a plate of life-changing nachos, even before they changed my life. And I told myself ""Dally G., no matter what happens tonight, whether it's because you go to the store and get the ingredients or because you go to Filibertos and get their supernachos, you're dumb ass is going to be chowin' down on delightfully tasty nachos this evening.""

So here's one of the keys to the story. It was a done deal. I already believed with 100% certainty that I would be eating a plate of nachos that evening. Are you with me? A sure thing, no matter what. The universe had no choice but to comply. Emerson said it best, ""The world makes way for a mo fo who knows where he's going.""

But my friends didn't eat the whole plate. Nacho remnants teased me like those little shorts hot young women wear in the spring. I'm not gonna lie; more inspired to get fat I have never been.

Time passes and my thoughts stagnate (but without any of the negative connotation normally associated with the idea of stagnation). Nachos. Can't let it go...Men quip and pontificate and ask answers and tell questions and borrow my phone to look at (censored) and some hit on Karina but I am of one mind: Nachos. 

And a woman's voice rings out! She was three words deep and I knew my life was changed forever. You, dear Yelper, should have chills right now. She said, and I quote, ""Hey, the cook made these by accident. Does anyone want them?"" I knew what they were without turning around but I had to look because my eyes compensate for my imperfect relationship with the universe and I needed to connect the truth in my soul to my physical experience that I call existence, living.

She sat down chickenless nachos right in front of me. They were free. For me. More beautiful than the first plate, they sparkled. CHEESE SPARKLED!

What does this mean? So what? Big deal. Total coincidence, right?

I know in my heart I connected with those nacho-potentialities and made them come to be as the beautiful plate that was placed before me... There's no question in my mind. Not even the faintest hint of doubt. And every day since, I've made small things happen. Am I able to win the lottery? No. I tried. But I didn't BELIEVE believe. I only wished and hoped and did what everyone else does. My skills are weak. It's very different knowing that the money is already mine, compared to knowing I'd have nachos. Winning the lottery is a huge and powerful experience that I'm not prepared for... Everyone asks me to will them their hearts' desires. It doesn't work like that... I don't care if you find your wallet (I do, but not like I need to)... You need to believe that you already have it and it will happen. You can literally have anything you want if it's mutually beneficial to you and the object's relationship to the world.

I know. This sounds like voodoo. Hocus pocus. The Secret. Whatever. It's crazy. I don't know it's true. I just feel it is with every ounce of passion and love and creative energy I've ever experienced... I share this experience primarily because I enjoy being made fun of but if even one person gives it a try and finds power in their life I've done a very good thing.

Our server was a bit weird, but ultimately helpful and friendly so that's all that matters. One of the other servers ""helping"" the table next to us was terrible and I'm glad we didn't have her. She seemed to be all attitude, and no help.

Brunch was great. I got the pancake platter, which comes with two pancakes of your choice, two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble (for 12$). I could have done without the over-spiced boring tofu scramble, but the pancakes (banana-nut flavoured) were excellent, especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup. Tofu sausage was fantastic.

I got an americano.  And while it wasn't a very big cup of coffee, or very caffeinated, it was very tasty.

I also ordered a side of soy yogurt, but really, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you get some jam. It's not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt that's really all it is, and it's not very good.

So a short visit - didn't get to try their food yet (blame it on Cripsy Bahn Mi-hehe) - even though appetizers and pizzas are are half price weekday afternoons (3-6 PM). There's always next time.

ISZq7pwgj_edHz8tBQZphg,wXi-P691AGOdonMy1TrL7w,jMEGdDfVSSubmFZhFnUfrg,4,7,0,0,"A visit to the Regency Palace feels a little decadent right from the beginning. I mean, it was designed that way. You step onto the top floor of Dragon City Mall where it was located into the truly beautiful lobby area. It is lush, a bit like a garden, and you cross over a small bridge that spans a koi pond. With that grand entrance to set the stage, you step out into the massive dining room. 

The dining room is all one room, but the square footage must be huge and it is split into smaller sections. If you are going for dim sum (which is what I mostly do), you are taken to the section that is the furthest back. The thing I like about the Regency Palace is that it does feel a little decadent and royal. It has a grand atmosphere.

In terms of lunch and/or dim sum, regency palace is where I bring picky people and large groups. At lunch time, there is also a lunch buffet that suits people who aren't as adventurous or who don't like dim sum, with more traditional chinese food (and western chinese food) fare.

The dim sum itself is quite good but not spectacular. The sheer size of the room means that by the time the cart gets to you, the food has often gotten a bit cold. If you can finagle a good spot by the kitchen doors, this isn't such a problem. I find that the staff is very accommodating and if they have room they do their best to fulfill that request. At the end, you have to take your scantron dim sum sheet to one of the payment stations that are a little bit difficult to find. 

You know, I've never had a bad experience at the Regency Palace. It is always consistent in service and food quality, and while it doesn't fit the bill as my top dim sum restaurant, it is my old faithful. And I love to make an entrance, so that is definitely ok.",2010-01-10 13:14:32

We went in on labor day looking for new appliances, we were considering a new washer and dryer and a dishwasher.  We waited awhile for the sales guy, Al wasvery helpful. We decided to wait on the washer/ dryer but started ringing up the dishwasher. Of course, the item we picked was out of stock yet they had one on the floor. The item was $399, and on sale for $279. They offer free shipping on items over $396. So, this would mean that they TACK ON AN ADDITIONAL $59 for delivery. I said, I wanted to pick it up at the store, this is NOT an option, only delivery. So, I'm being charged $59 bucks on a sale item that not one store has in stock...absolutely bullshit! 

The right thing to do would be to sell me the store model, discount one you have in Stock, offer free delivery or just let me pick up the item I want. 

I left there after losing an hour of my time, and went to Lowe's, I saved $50 on an upgraded dishwasher and they had it in Stock to take home with no additional fees. 

Chandler HD, you lost a good customer and Lowe's was appreciated that we will be returning to purchase additional appliances and home needs.

He's been here previously for a birthday brunch, as well as picking up wine. Anyway, we were pretty much in the mood to wine & dine, and that's exactly what we did with a 3 course meal. 

The sun was setting as they were seating us at the patio right next to the fireplace. I was hesitant at first because it was soooo cold out there, but our server Vince kindly asked if I wanted the overhead heater to be turned on. I couldn't get over how beautiful the view was from where we were sitting (mostly because we don't see a lot of water in Vegas lol).

Appetizers:
-Roasted Hudson Valley Foi Gras 
-Chef's Selection of Artisan Cheeses

I must say, I wasn't sure how to feel about the Foi Gras. The flavors were definitely there, but I just think I wasn't used to the textures. It melts in your mouth & it was definitely interesting. On the other hand, I enjoyed the cheeses and the Chardonnay I ordered to pair it with.

*Vince kindly brought us other wines to taste. Very sweet of him*

EntrÃ©es:
-Steak ""Frites"" 
-Oven Roasted Grouper

I ordered the steak frites and it was delicious. The wagyu was cooked medium rare and was tender and juicy. I paired my entrÃ©e with a Pinot Noir. My boyfriend ordered the Grouper and he says the flavors were perfectly balanced. He paired his entrÃ©e with a Cab. Yummm!! 

Dessert: crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e 

As if we weren't full enough, our wonderful server Vince showed us the dessert menu and he recommended the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. I was a fan of the custard base, but I found the caramel on top to be too sweet for me. Still very good! 

Overall, my first experience here was phenomenal. It was literally the perfect date night, from the atmosphere to the food and service. It was intimate and romantic. You definitely get what you pay for.

I purchased a groupon and was told if I wasn't satisfied with the results after I had used up the (6) treatments with the groupon I could ""trade up"" and put that groupon towards the ""any body area for a year offer groupon."" 

After the 6 treatments, I wasn't satisfied with the results, so I called to trade up and was told I couldn't do that, even though every technician had told me I would be able to throughout the course of my groupon. They warned that I not stop part way through my treatments so I conceded and purchased the $69/month because I could cancel anytime. 

I went every six weeks for another 9 treatments and finally threw in the towel. I called to cancel and they asked my reason, I explained how many times I'd gone, the money I spent, the lack of results, and that each time I asked a technician how many treatments they thought I would ultimately need, I kept getting different answers. I understand it varies but they must have some idea, and if they don't they shouldn't say one groupon will be enough!

A manager contacted me and asked to meet so she could see my results. When we met, she agreed after the number of treatments I'd received I should be seeing better results. She gave me four free treatments which I appreciated and recently finished. There was no additional follow up and my results aren't much different than before the 4 additional treatments.

It's the worst burrito joint in town and quite frankly, I dislike the entire franchise in general. It is extremely overpriced and the quality of food does not match up to its price. This location is placed in the corner of Hwy 7 and McCowan and the location itself is clean/organized.

1. This location claims to have deals that would ""save"" us money but it just over charges for simple items. All other burrito joints charge around $6-7 for veggie quesadillas. This place charges around 8.99 and they claim to give you a deal with a free pop can which ends up being $10. HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE?! the meat one must be super expensive then... and its ONLY a quesadilla!!

2. The paneer option (the only other vegetarian option despite the veggies) is an additional $1.00. This makes no sense to me because all the meat protein options are not additional cost so I wonder why this one is? I don't think it's priced fairly and it's not like it's organic or anything. 

4. The salsa cup was only filled half way...super stingy location. 

5. The quesadilla lacked flavour and cheese. It was super dry and I was not pleased with the taste.

Cute little french pastry shop with a clean and cozy interior. A handful of tables (about four) that seat two people each. Not a very big place, so probably best to get things to go or come during off hours if you want to eat here. I heard lines can get pretty long which would crowd the bakery quickly.

PASTRIES:
I think they only make a certain amount each day, so once they're sold out (which happens) then you're out of luck. To me, this speaks to the quality and freshness.

Got me the Almond Croissant that was recommended by a friend. Excuse me while I wipe the white powder that is sugary goodness off my lips. 

Personally, I don't like things that are super sweet (ie: I dilute my fruit juices with water to cut down on the sugar...don't judge me!). This pastry was just about right on the sweet-o-meter. A tad bit on the sweet side though, so I cut it in half to save for later. I don't think I would be able to finish the whole thing in one sitting without feeling guilty or bouncing off the walls from the sugar high. My friends who got the almond croissant all raved about it, and I agree. No doubt, it was delicious. Parts of the base/bottom tasted a bit doughy though, but it wasn't a big deal...maybe that's how its supposed to be? I'd definitely get the croissant again and try the other pastries.

SERVICE:
Very polite, warm, and patient people working in the shop. Gave some good recommendations about their offerings. Classy establishment with classy people.

Island Malaysian Cuisine is a family-run restaurant on the second floor of Asian Pacific Plaza, which is also home to the smaller of two SF Supermarket locations, Sushi Neko, A18, Hue Thai... I could go on and on. They seem to have been here for a while, dating back to a older incarnation under the name of Penang, and they can handle somewhat larger groups like our party of 9.

I had a number of dishes, and they ranged from pretty good to unimpressive (which was why some of the following descriptions are uninspired).

Roti Canai ($3.95): pretty nice crispy ""Indian-style"" pancake. The chicken curry is nice, but the portion is pretty small. It might serve two if you're not hungry.

Char Kway Teo ($8.50): seems more similar to Chinese flat noodle dishes than the Thai pad see ew. Luscious noodles. Most enjoyable dish here, but also not as interesting as the more boldly sauced pad see ew or other Thai dishes.

Ginger Scallion Duck ($7.50): served with rice. This was okay, but forgettable, and is probably just a Chinese dish.

Beef with Broccoli? ($11.50): this almost looks like Beef with Broccoli but came with Chinese broccoli instead. It's an okay version of the dish, but it reads full-on Chinese.

Kari Sotong? ($12.95): didn't hear what the tablemate ordered, but this seems to match the menu description of a curry dish with squid. It was good, so perhaps we should've had more curries here.

Sizzling Seafood Combination Delight ($15.95): another standard Chinese restaurant dish. Shrimp, scallop, mushroom, veggies. Seems pricey for so little.

The tortas were just what I expected and had enough amount of meat as they pile loads of it on. The gf had the king torta while I had the queen. Though ironic both tortas  had both of us feeling full. Five stars would of been great but the waitress paid no regard to us only refilling our drinks twice.

When I walked in, the line for the register was curved around into the isles. I saw multiple people with carts, but I couldn't locate them. I found an associate, who had no problem showing me where they are located....where I found one that thankfully had a ""stroller"" part on the front.....a broken strap, but thankfully, my daughter didn't try to escape.

The store was very messy, and picked through, but I think that this is because of the amount of people that were here. I see people saying how ""overpriced"" things are...Last time I checked, designers like VERA WANG, Jennifer Lopez , Rock & Republic, and Lauren Conrad have always been expensive....However, they had lots of sales today. Many 30-40% off on these brands, making them decent....These brands also had plenty of sizes, ranging from 0-16.....and I didn't have to do any digging for them.

The store has plenty of clearance racks that are excessively messy, that I didn't have the patience to go through. They have various trinkets, ornaments, kitchen things, etc. 

I didn't try anything on or buy today....I wasn't feeling the vibe..because of how busy and chaotic it was.......I don't thrive in those types of environments. I do see the potential in this store though.

Pretty easy to order, the menu is up and you can decide while waiting in line because that gives you PLENTY of time considering how long the line was.
Choose your cookie, then your ice cream, then toppings (optional but $.50 each), then you can choose whether you want it hot pressed. I highly recommend because who doesn't like a warm cookie?!
I tried a butter pecan ice cream sandwich between a peanut butter and snicker doodle cookie. AMAZING. My boyfriend got a brownie bear bowl with cookie dough ice cream. That was also to die for. I love brownies and that hit the spot!

He and I sit down, order a Dusty Road and a 23 Skiddoo respectively, and waited about 20 minutes for the order.

I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I love good coffee, and I love that coffee more when it is artfully brewed. I'm a purist. I prefer black coffee or espresso. And I tend to think of flavors and cream as  something to mask mediocrity. But I digress. So I ordered the espresso and the husband ordered coffee. Delicious. Plus, we received sparkling water, as is common practice in foreign countries where they celebrate it's play against the coffee on the palate. Perfect. There was also free water available, flavored beautifully with cucumber. 
I'm already happy. And then the food. We ordered a sandwich and a quiche. The sandwich was well prepared and incredibly tasty. And then there was the quiche. I'm generally not a huge fan of them. Can't really say I've ever met one that I enjoyed. But the husband is a big fan. Upon trying a bite, I understood his love of them. The crispy flaky crust, the tender, melt-in-your mouth fluffiness of egg. Oh goodness, this is what it's supposed to taste like. It was amazing. The husband said a true quiche should have some parsley in it, but I was more concerned with the deliciousness than authenticity.

Suddenly, they have a bacon night, the interior is hipster chic and the food has been significantly upgraded.

I just recently went there again this past Saturday with my daughter Muff and my sister Luch and we had a pig-out moment. There is no good reason why three people should order entrees and several appetizers for lunch, but we did that.  My sister and I ordered the Salmon BLTs. (She tried to be healthy by ordering a side salad with her sandwich, but I went all the way in by ordering the fries to go with!)  Muff ordered the ""I Can Has Bacon Cheezburger?"" and tatter tots. (Muff could only finish half of burger since we got the appetizers too.) We also ordered the Hush Piggies, which are home-made tatter tots with bacon and cheddar cheese (What's wrong with that?) and Chimichurri Flurry wings.  (Those wings were delightful and delicious!  I usually ask that my wings be fried on the hard side, but they instinctively knew that's the best way to serve them.)
  
We also ordered the Cookies-N-Cream dessert which is a hot chocolate cookie served in a small cast iron pan with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce.  I'm not really a dessert person, but I have to say that that warm chocolate chip cookie with the ice cream was tasty.  Go on Harris Grill, you have stepped up your game! 

It's nice when an older restaurant in a quote, unquote ""chic"" neighborhood decides to do a remix of their space and menu.  That has been the death knell of many established restaurants.

The food is fine. The rolls are good but very unhealthy; you'll be served an ample supply. The steaks are decent but not fantastic; the vegetable skewers and shrimp skewers are a much better option.

One big disappointment with Logan's are the salads. I love a salad with steak on it, but the options here are limited. Chicken, yes. Steak, no.

The frozen margaritas (strawberry, raspberry or peach) are fantastic, and they're half-priced during happy hour. After one or two, the pulled pork tastes better (ok, not really, but I don't mind so much).

So they set it up and break it down each day. So when you go into the restaurant you can tell that it wasn't necessarily designed to have the buffet. The spacing and set up is a little bit awkward. 

The last time I went with my friend we got the soft shell crab appetizer! It was out of this world! I would highly recommend ordering it if you like tempura soft shell crab.

Oxtail french fries look appealing but not a practical dish in my opinion, the fries were way too soggy and the oxtail marmalade just doesn't mix as it is much greasier at taste than when you have loaded fries (melted cheese and bacon). If the fries were very crispy, I'd enjoy the dish.

Papaya salad was decent but the big bone soup took the show for me. I enjoyed it as it had a lot of taste. The broth did need a lot of lime (but that is my own preference). What a presentation! Although they should consider machine sawing it to smaller piece so you can actually chew at it. 

The bun bo hue was enjoyable. But the grilled squid wasn't too great for me. I enjoy Cafe Moda's squid better, it is not chewy and was too dry.

They did forget about my Hennessy cafe su da but I ended up reminding them and they comped it. Honestly I'd rather this place 3-3.5 stars but I'll give it 4 for the customer service.

Place has awesome decor and is definitely a place to try. But I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. At the price and actual product served, I think this place is for a different kind of crowd. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place at all!",2017-08-29 21:46:13

teri beef:  a solid bit too salty. and even though cut properly (against the grain), still tough.
macaroni salad: sadly, it was served super cold! couldn't taste it.  i think they need to turn that fridge down a few degrees! then again, if you're doing take out, that thing is the perfect temperature by the time you get home.
poke--was ok this visit. got the hawaii one with limu.

friendly service, lots of local people hanging out. i wish they could have someone bring them a BIB of the real strawberry flavored fruit punch from the islands instead of the tropicana version. i like the fanta syrup, but it's easy to get the big box at restaurant supply places--they're even near the airport. :)  i'd be happy to volunteer to bring you guys a box next time i have to bring checked luggage anyway. or maybe LV coke distributor can nab some for you guys. :)",2016-12-20 06:42:43

It's 111 freaking degrees and you want a little heat in your food but also something refreshing and tasty and a little southwesty.

You are thinking to yourself, Arizona, your first time, they must have some good southwestern, Tex-Mexy type stuff, right?  You've heard they have all sorts of chi-chi (but not Chi Chi's) little restaurants down here to feed and entertain the people who live here in the 111 degree heat with all that money to burn off before they die, right?   Look at all the fancy landscaping and toney zoning controls that keep everything adobe and tasteful;  the food MUST be good, right?  They probably zone for that, too, right?

Well, this is basically Chevy's with money and a little attitude.  It's a Chevy's that's moved to Scottsdale after winning the lottery.  It's enchilada combinations with your beans, your rice, your enchiladas, and yes, all the ingredients are fresh, but it's still just a fancy Chevy's.  It's not like there's a chef back there expressing himself.  What's back there is a Corporation that borrowed the Chevy's concept, tarted it up, slapped it into a faux Mayan ruins via Spanish Colonial burbling fountain super duper atmosphere building, jacked some prices, and made sure there was plenty of tequila behind the bar.

Mind you, I didn't have a Margarita.  It was before the meeting.  If we had stopped after the meeting in the 111 degree heat, after I was all sweaty and relaxed having kicked meeting ass, and I'd ordered a really good Margarita, it's entirely possible I would be singing this place up and down the 202.  It's the Margarita factory, after all.  Which is weird--why would I want a factory-fresh Margarita?  So maybe I wouldn't be singing it's praises.

But really, it's just a Chevy's with a private school diploma.  You could do worse, but I also think maybe you could do better.",2006-06-14 01:57:55

Place is super cute, and I love the aesthetic.

Service is super friendly and I loved that our server was very attentive, but I would've appreciated a little more space and time to ponder the menu and enjoy our meal. Otherwise, she gave some great recommendations and was knowledgeable about the menu.

I really enjoyed the fried deviled eggs. Super original and delicious idea. I was super skeptical, but it wasn't greasy at all. Plus, the breading was very well done.

I was not a fan of the heirloom tomato salad. I thought the food quality was good, but I wasn't a fan of the dressing. Something about it reminded me of barbecue sauce, but my boyfriend loved it, so I think it's just up to preference. 

My boyfriend loved the signature banh mi. He thought the pork was amazing and said it was the best Viet sandwich he ever had.

Overall, even though I was kind of disappointed in my salad, their menu looks super promising. I'll definitely be back for drinks and the food (especially that broccolini banh mi).",2017-08-28 23:21:22
igKC42VgvdN6h-vwE9h0og,Fp3Syu5So-vgdaB1oAAk6w,p4hzwmiBvq3Clj65JyPGSQ,4,4,2,3,"The truth is that I'm torn.  Politically, I really want to dislike Wild Wing, and it's because it's a franchise chain, and because franchise chains tend to threaten local pubs and bistros and so ruin a local area's unique vibe and character.  There are enough stripmalls and carboncopy eateries in the world already, as far as I'm concerned.

The Wild Wing Corporation has seemingly sprung up all over downtown Toronto in the last year, clearly trying to homogenize and muscle in on the growing Buffalo wing craze.  This particular location is very probably trying to draw customers away from my own personal and beloved haunt, Loons, which is about a block away at the Roncesvalles/Howard Park intersection.  I'm worried.

Thankfully, Loons still has it down when it comes to solid, stick-to-your-ribs hot meals apart from the standard pubfare, and their wings are seriously good, all considered.  But I'm afraid that I do have to admit that, in some ways, Wild Wings is a like an upstart, young Sugar Ray Leonard here, giving the well-established challengers some bopping and swerving moves in the ring.

To start with, WW boasts some 91 flavours to choose from, and about half of those are actually not some variant of hot and spicy.  This is good news for those of a mellower palate who simply want to enjoy some pleasant sauces on their poultry limbs instead of feeling embers from Hades sliding down their throats.  

These flavours include a variety of assorted clerverly-named blends and fusions of any or all of these:  BBQ, jerk, pineapple, maple, curry, honey garlic, Thai, mango, garlic, Cajun, chipotle, lemon, dill, kethcup, buttermilk, parmesan, ranch, caesar, mustard, hickory, black pepper, teriyaki, and yes, chocolate.

But I'm a fire man, and the hottest to be offered here include ""She's a Hottie"" (triple suicide blend), ""Cadillac Ranch"" (caesar/ranch/suicide), ""Home On The Ranch"" (ranch/suicide), ""Bubba's Backfire"" (BBQ/suicide), ""Catch Me If You Can"" (maple/suicide), my personal fave ""Dusty Muckaroo"" (honey garlic/suicide), and their two super inferno options, ""Sweatin Bullets"" (a suicide/smokey BBQ fusion) and Ring Of Fire (blend of various suicides).  Whoah.

Wings are offered in counts of 9, 18, 28, 36, 50, and 100 pieces, all with option of regular or boneless, breaded or not.  It's a tad expensive here, but if you're smart you might show up on one of their specials nights: Tuesday (14 wings for $10), Wednesday (double wings and a pitcher for $30), or Thursday (pint and pound for $13).

Wings are served with ranch or bleu cheese options, but in cups that are half-full at best.  The metal busket (like those found at Duff's) is useful, as are the particularly firm and large wetnaps available.

Sometimes the vibe is cool and distant, but you can always relax on the extensive side patio with its young trees and view of passing streetcars.  

The brats eat free on Sundays.  The meatheads enjoy UFC on the big screens here.  If you're driving and it;s after normal business hours, take a chance and park in the Master Mechanic's lot across the street.

The biggest drawback is the price and the general lack of unique character (unless fresh-from-the-box psuedo-Western is your thing), but I have to say than tham thar wings is purdy damned okelydokely.",2011-08-25 18:52:58

Service was very very friendly but the food we ordered not so great.  

I ordered some Hawaiian pork with a side of macaroni salad.  The pork was overdone and crispy like it had been cooked before.  The mac salad was very salty. 

The hubby ordered a noodle bowl and said the noodles were not cooked and it was just okay.  

Prices are not ""cheap"" for the value. We spent $30 and it wasn't worth it especially for the small servings.  

There were lots of flies buzzing around, they did have some fans but it didn't help.  It's located in a rundown dirty strip mall-it could use a face lift.

I am a big family person which means I spend lots of time with my Mom, and Grandma and Grandpa- not just boyfriend and friends. I had been to this restaurant once before and it was so good that I wanted to bring my family. I went here with my Grandma and Grandpa and unfortunately the restaurant I found to be the music to be way to loud that day and it was not that way when I had been there the last time. It was almost like a nightclub. I believe that at a restaurant the music should be moderately loud but not overly loud. People, obviously, talk and restaurants and need to be heard so the volume increases from people talking over each other. This music seems to be trying to be louder than the people which is not how it should be. That is why Anejo is losing a star- for how loud it is but the food is amazing! 
I have had under the ""Sharing for Two"" the Guacamole (avocado, cilantro, jalapeÃ±o, onion, tomato and lime salt) and Salsa De Molcajete (oven roasted tomatoes, jalapeÃ±o, roasted garlic, grilled lime and onions). Of the two I would recommend the salsa as it had more flavour. The guacamole needs more lime, but it was fairly bland. The serving of chips that comes could also be a little bigger.. They make it right at your table to alter to your level of spicy which is a nice touch. 
I have also had the Ceviche Tostadas (seasonal ceviche, lime, cabbage, avocado) which was not my favourite ceviche I have had. They were generous with the amount they put on the cracker but too generous as it was too heavy for the cracker and the cracker would break. The cabbage was not a good choice on these and again it needed more flavour. The seasonal ceviche when I went was Salmon and shrimp. 
I have also had the avocado toast off the brunch menu which was AMAZING! The best thing I have eaten there so I would highly recommend this. 
Really.. you don't go there to eat though- you go there to drink. I have had every margarita on the menu and my favourite is strawberry rhubarb or the seasonal (when I went) was pomegranate. I also like the Guava but it is too thick and my Mom's favourite is the Coconut Child which reminded me of the Mango heat slurp from 7-11... sadly. 
Therefore, if you go there you need to get at least two sensational margaritas and the avocado toast.

This is a modern art museum, which definitely takes an interesting take on what modern art is (I guess modern art is always undefined, anyways). The top  floor holds the temporary exhibits, so it's nice to start there and work your way down. When I was there a couple months ago they had some massive wood sculptures carved from tree trunks and one big installation which was basically a big hole that overlooked the neighbor's backyard. Very interesting. 

My absolute favorite thing is the light exhibits on the 2nd floor. Take your beau and grab on. It's terrifying and fun at the same time.

This was just another stop on our vintage shopping spree whilst looking for a vintage looking ornate iron mirror.  No such luck on that.  I can't complain too much though, because I was introduced to this wonderful store.

Walking in is kind of like an assault of femininity.  There are fluffy things everywhere, sparkle covered candles, and the colors pink, green, and white abound.  I also can't forget the massive amounts of shabby chic stuff in here, but that is pretty obvious just by looking at the outside of the store.

After perusing the store for a bit, and finding lots of cool stuff that we couldn't necessarily afford and didn't necessarily need, we happened upon a ceramic bowl filled with vintage doorknobs and keyholes.  We were instantly inspired by this.  We found an amazing doorknob set from the New Orleans Public School.  Buying that and a matching set of keyholes set us back about 32 bucks.  Not too bad.

I also discovered this place has scrapbook stuff.  I used to be an avid scrapbooker, but not so much anymore.  I could get into serious trouble at this place.

""The whole world doesn't speak English.  Winge winge winge.  They have pictures, Just point"" I say to Midwest poker bud who immediately shows off an expertly choreographed hand gesture.

Dumbing it way down, in general, spicy sambal and fresh chili, lots of fermented dried shrimp and shrimp sauce, lots of lemon grass and herbs.  Traditional foods of Malaysia sit along side those of India (solid) and China (uhhhh, not so successful and generally sweeter than the original).

Island Malaysian, with its bizarre decor, half dive bar, half restaurant has some seriously authentic and delicious Malaysian dishes.  WARNING:  navigate the menu carefully as many dishes are there to satisfy Western taste.

Straight to it, nasi lemak, the national dish of Malaysia.  In this case rice cooked in coconut milk with ayam rendang (chicken stewed in lemon grass, kafir lime leaves, coconut, and chilis) with boiled egg, cucumber, and sambal.  Personally more accustomed to the Singaporean version (more things on the plate), we add a sambal ikan billis, a grilled whole fish brushed with spicy sambal and deep fried eggplant.  Use your hands.  A pinch of rendang with the rice, some of this and that.  Simple, fun and good.

Need veg?  Kangkung Belacan (water spinach sautÃ©ed with fermented, salted shrimp paste) requested with chili and garlic.  Again, simple but packs a flavor punch.

Wanna sample ""Chinese""?  Char kway teow.  Basically wok tossed rice flour noodles AKA chow fun with shrimp and bean sprouts.  Good wok hey flavor.  Slightly sweet.  

Finally, Penang's gift to the culinary world, Asam Laksa, noodles in a beautiful sweet sour fish based soup with a strong backbone of tamarind, lemongrass, garlic, ginger, shallots, herbs and fermented shrimp, garnished with lots of flaked boiled fish, onions, chili, mint, and shrimp paste.  Fiery, complex  and oh so good. 

Be sure to order the barley ice drink.  Simple but puts out the fire from spicier dishes.

Asian service.  Nuff said.

I mean..I held it down, but it was nothing special. The drink was pretty pitiful too...probably around the 12- 16 oz variety.

Plus, how can you serve food and NOT have a public restroom? Isn't that a violation of some sort??? Seriously?

If you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into...

It was rubbery.  The crab legs were good too but somehow they were too salty.  The broccoli was even salty.  Who the fudge is goofin around with the sodium chloride in the kitchen?

The food is very good for the price. Be prepared to more or less have your food thrown on the table (once she knocked the creamer bowl off the table). 

For a local greasy spoon, it lacks the family-feel of a local cafe. Sad, because it's so damn convenient. Sad, because it could be so much better with just a smile.

Menu is great and I was surprised to see lots of combos for surf and turf. The server was young but very attentive but not overly. I thought the prices were very reasonable for a steakhouse. 

Contrary to what you might think, it's better to eat at a restaurant when it's busier rather than slow. Good cooks get ""in the zone"" and rock it out when it's busy. When its slow they space things off and in this case forget to flip my supposed to be mid-rare ribeye before it was too late and over cooked. 

Jen's steak was overcooked but not as bad. They must have been cooking a lot of fish because the grilled vegetables had that added flavor of old seafood. Not a combo I would have visioned but hey maybe some people like that warm fish taste all over their zucchini.  Great pun!  I'm hilarious. I had a great follow up joke but Jen wouldn't let me post it. 

My mom ate til she was burping full and liked it a lot but she's 79 and was dipping the celery from the app sampler into the marinara so in not sure if her stamp of approval counts.

Dimpflmeier now supplies many of your favourite chain supermarkets, but allow yourself a visit to the mothership and you will be happier in more ways than logic would allow. 
To begin, the bakery offers more variety than any I have been to (and that's saying a lot). You can find everything from ""Hunter Style Rye Bread"" to ""Viking Bread"" all under one roof. Chances are also that your favourite loaf will still be steaming the new packaging and will cost you less than the stale-ass bread offered at the aforementioned favourite chain supermarket (I'm using favourite a lot in this review, bear with me!)
Importantly, Dimpflmeier mothership bakery also offers an astounding variety of sweets ranging from possibly the best donuts in town, to marzipan strudels! If that's not enough, there is a reasonably large seating area for those times you just can't wait to get home or in case you want to have some coffee and cake while looking out the window and enjoying the scenic Advance Rd. (disclaimer: Advance Rd. may not appear scenic to all patrons). 

While I absolutely love this place, two small issues bump Dimpfle down to a 4* experience for me. The first one is that parking is painful unless you arrive at a random time. However since the bakery is in the middle of nowhere, as far as I'm concerned, it should not be too difficult to find parking somewhere on the street. The second and more serious issue is that not all varieties of breads and sweets are tasty/well made and sometimes you feel whoever was making the batch of blueberry strudel that day did a half assed job! Overall the good outweighs the bad by a lot! Dimpflmeier is a win",2011-02-15 01:41:39

To welcome us back for a second visit, he offered a gift card and it remained on my fridge for nearly a year before we could plan a return trip. By the time we were able to go back, I realized it had expired. I reached back out to Steve to see if we could have the card reinstated and he quickly replied and offered to leave a new card at the front desk. So awesome! He did warn me that this particular weekend there would be a pool party and that they had expected over 3000 people to attend. I thanked him for the warning as we had originally planned on making it a pool day after our spa treatments. We decided it wouldn't be a big deal and that we would come home afterwards and enjoy our own pool after our treatments.

I called the spa to partake in the Spring Training special of a 60min massage for $79 and set up our appointments. I requested Dawn again since she was fantastic last year and was pleased when I found out she was available at the time we wanted. 

When we arrived at the hotel, we used the self parking on the west side of building and took a short walk in. No messing with the crazy valet. You could tell the hotel was much busier with the pool party going on. We saw the same person who checked us in a year prior at Registration and she did seem more friendly this time but we had another helpful person assist us with picking up the gift card.  Thankfully there was no issue with picking up the card and we were on our way up to the spa. 

Upon check-in the spa was exactly how I remembered it. The staff at the front were helpful and I got a tour of the facility again. It was nice to still see they had the co-ed area to hang out in. I also noticed in the women's waiting area some really good trail-mix that hadn't been there last time. Dried strawberries and nuts? YES, please! The steam sauna felt good and so did the Jacuzzi. Per Steve's warning, the pool party was in full swing downstairs. What I didn't expect was the loud bass throughout my spa visit. I actually enjoyed the music when you could walk out on the balcony and watch the party BUT all you could hear in the spa was the thud of the bass. It was definitely distracting during use of the Jacuzzi but having been warned prior, I didn't mind it too much. Some of the other spa patrons didn't appreciate it though. I was told that these parties go on throughout the summer so if you are looking for a total blissed out day, ask the front desk if there will be a pool party going on that day and you might want to consider another day. 

Dawn came and got me right on time and took me back to the treatment room. The massage was just as incredible as the one I had last year. Everything she did felt really good and it seem to last a really long time..but in a good way. The table was slightly warm but a quick request to turn down the heat made it perfect. I only wish I could make it back here more frequently! My fiance had upgraded to a sports massage and while he thoroughly enjoyed it, we were initially charged the full price of that massage rather than an upgrade to the standard massage. They quickly changed it at checkout after I questioned the charge with no push back.

If you're looking for a great massage, definitely go make an appointment with Dawn!",2014-05-26 00:53:54

I've had food from here on two separate occasions; the first time was take out and a coworker picked it up and the most recent time was a rainy and cold Sunday evening.
On both times the food was great. I had pho both times, first chicken, then beef as well as shrimp spring rolls and spicy edamame. While I have nothing to complain about regarding the food, I've had better. Don't get me wrong, its very good, but maybe not as authentic as it could be? Still easily a 4 star rating.
I would have to say that service was 2 stars. You can walk in from the front (7th St side) or the back (parking lot side). Regardless of which entry you use, there is no host stand and no clear place to stand. It was a busy night and I felt that no matter where I stood, I was in someone's way or was close to having my ass in a customer's face.  I had to ask what the seating arrangements were after being ignored for about 5+ minutes. Do we seat ourselves? Do we wait to be seated? We were told there was a 15 minute wait because of how busy they were. Well, no one else was waiting and they were clearing off two two-seater tables (these were the only open tables in the restaurant and there was only two of us). We did happen to get seated within just a couple minutes though.Our server was less than patient with us and it was clear he was frazzled. Up ordering, we were informed they were out of chicken. With each table that ordered after us, they were out of something different. First chicken, then beef, then glasses, then small pho bowls.
I don't know if that's a norm, or if it was just them being ill-prepared for a busy weekend, but it felt like something I would expect from a brand new restaurant with completely new staff and management. At least the food was good.",2015-11-18 20:26:28

My girlfriend had the Roasted Pork Ramen with house bacon, pickled mustard greens, a poached egg, bean sprouts, and shiitake. She loved it! My friends ordered the seafood ramen with udon noodles and the only bad thing they had to say was that they wish it was in a bigger bowl with more broth. 

The restaurant setting was super chill and all the workers were friendly. However, the only part that limited me from giving 5 stars was the wait time.

Knuckle Down Saloon may not be a dive bar in one of Chicago's neighborhoods but it did have some decent talent playing there. The also have food in the form of burgers.
We arrived on a Friday around 7:30 (music started at 8) as we wanted to get something to eat before the music. The menu mainly consists of burgers but they do offer more than plain and cheese. If you do get a cheese burger your options of cheese include American, cheddar, and pepper jack. I ordered their black and blue burger, a burger with blue cheese. We were not disappointed. Sides included a bar of fried and fried curds. Overall the for was better than we had expected.
The beer selection includes a few draft beers included our favorite, Guinness.
The only hiccup was they didn't have buns to fulfill our food order but they sent someone or for them and they did everything they could to make it right. That apologized and informed us of the delay and have us each a drink chip.
The club did fill up just before the music started and was basically standing room after 8.

Last night however, was a different experience. We sat at a booth and ordered drinks. My friends both ordered the sampler packs, and I was overjoyed when I saw Steigl Radler on their beer menu. They have my favourite beer! And it was only 6.5$, which is considerably cheaper than the other place in town that carries this beer.

On to the food. I ordered the lamb crepe because I had read that it is big enough for a meal. To be safe, I also ordered onion rings. I was hungry, and wanted to make sure my meal was filling. My friends got the prime rib and the bison short ribs. The food came at a decent time, and the portions looked HUGE. My friend's prime rib was a HUGE HUNKERIN' slab of meat. We wondered how the hell he was going to eat that. My lab crepe was a really good, and very tasty. It was savoury, cheesy and very filling. Definitely more of a MEAL than an appetizer. The onion rings were good, but my personal preference leans on the crispier side. I had a bite of my friend's prime rib - and - o.m.g. - I had a moment with that piece of meat in my mouth. My eyes closed, and the noise drowned away for a few seconds.. It made me feel like I hadn't had meat in years. It was juicy, succulent, flavourful, and just really, REALLY GOOD. In fact, I want to tell everyone that anytime you are craving a phenomenal steak/prime rib or anything of that sort, consider Wurst. It is fantastic! 

Wurst's menu is very very pig-centric, so I cannot try TOO many things on their menu, but from what I did try, I was definitely impressed. And bonus points for carrying my favourite beer.",2012-03-02 19:32:25

My first experience here I thought the pho was lacking flavor and the spring rolls were just okay. I don't order the spring rolls much but I have become a fan.

The papaya salad at this location is amazing. I crave this salad. It is light, refreshing, crispy and fresh. The papaya salad is covered with thin shreds of dried beef that offer some meatiness and has this bright soy dressing that is the perfect balance of all flavors. I normally prefer my papaya salad Thai or Laos style but Pho Real has converted me. I love this papaya salad and will have to get some now that I am thinking about it.

The bun bo hue is good here. Good solid flavor and not oily. I was expecting a piece of pork trotter so I was surprised to see it just pieces of pork trotter in it. I would like more of that. One of the favorite parts of bun bo hue is the pig foot and gelatinous skin and meat on it. The noodles were perfect, the meat was tender and really it was on point.

The pho the last few times has been better and definitely on point. One of the things I always look for in pho is the coloring of the meat. I have seen pho where the rare meat once it gets cooked gets a tinge of metallic coloring to it and I haven't seen that here. Which means their sh&t is fresh. Can't be mad at that. Their soups come in different sizes which is awesome sauce to me. Perfect sizes for everyone in our family.

Get a shake here with the popping bubbles. We were very excited to find this because after moving from Las Vegas, where popping bubbles are available everywhere we hadn't seen it so much in Charlotte. They also offer different flavors for the popping bubbles.

Getting right to the point about the service....
-There was no hostess to greet us (which is fine because there usually aren't any at Chinese places)
-Stood at the front of the restaurant for 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us... even though at least 4 employees stared at us! 
-Ask to move tables because she seated me to face THE WALL, and the lady had the nerve to say ""Excuse Me"" and brushed me off and walk to another customer. 
-Took forever to get the bill, to flag any wait staff or get refills (in fact we didn't even get any!)
-Service was so bad that I eventually walked to the counter to get the bill and ask for refills myself. Not once, not even twice, but three times.

Overall, that was the worst service I ever received and you could see that other customers were frustrated too. As soon as we sat down, we knew that we just wanted to hurry up and order and get the hell out of there!

Now onto the food. My mom is a vegetarian, and a damn good cook, so I was hoping to surprise her and she was pleased. 

-enoki mushroom balls were amazing
-bbq pork was very good
-har gow and dumpling was DISGUSTING. They put way too much horse radish that I was practically tearing up. In the har gow they put too much bamboo that it was overpowering. They didn't taste anything similar to the real thing at all.
-the sushi was ok.
-menu was all scambled and confusing. For example it would go from apps, to combos to main entrees, to lunch, to tea, to dinner combos. 
-fried rice was good, but way too salty 
-portions were small for the price
-food was warm, it wasn't sizzling hot or fresh, and you could tell.

Walking in, I was immediately surprised by the decor. Very sophisticated, classy, high ceilings, black chairs. Very trendy. The hostess greeted us and seated us immediately as we had made reservations a week before.

Our server was ab fab. The drinks were delicious.

I had the 22 oz. bone in rib eye and my bf had the new york strip.

not a steakhouse and i was hesitant to order steak but what can you do when the cow calls?

the bone in rib eye came with chipotle sauce and some other types of salsa, with grilled garlic and red peppers on top. 

so many different flavors but somehow the sweet, sour, salty, spicy all came together for a harmonious blend.

the new york strip was a tad more delicious than the rib eye. i like the way the fat is marbled throughout the meat.

The food (I had the $3 tacos during happy hour) was decent, but nothing remarkable or earth shattering. The $3 beers were a hit with our group, but to a person (there were six of us), no one had anything nice to say about their food. Just sorta good, but not great.

Other than having some TV's which you can't hear over their music, I don't see how they can call themselves a sports bar...that doesn't even make sense. Maybe it changes during football season, but it isn't anything like a sports bar at the moment.

As for a dance club, we didn't stay to see it, but there is a large rectangular bar in the middle of the place and a DJ station at one end. I guess the dance floor would be between the DJ and the end of the bar which is not a large space. They were preparing for bottle service while we were there, and the wait staff was preoccupied.

It's tricky to get a reservation there but the wait-staff said you have the best chance for a walk-in near 5pm when they open. That seemed true tonight (Sunday).

Buca serves a LOT of meat. Lots of odd cuts of meat with great flavour.

It was the first time I tried LAMB BRAINS, which were really great. They were saltimbocca style, in fried crispy veal. The inner texture was soft but it was seasoned very well. Very similar to sweetbreads. I found brain is more of an accent than a taste on its own. I was worried if the concept of eating BRAINS would gross me out, but it didn't! They were really great! 

I didn't like the fried pigs ear with fennel. Luckily my dining partner ate them all up.

The wine pairing was novel with a lot of variety. The sommelier's descriptions of most wines was accurate but a few seemed not to be as described but were good.

Service was great and pretty relaxed. The cocktails were good too.

My only criticism was they should have poured a bit more wine with the big meat platter. Glass was empty for about 10mins. The flavours of the platter are really bold and could really use the wine.

I hope people in this city realize how privileged they are to have a place exhibiting such craft.  Came here with my colleagues on a Saturday night, after hearing about this place several weeks ago.

Food (9.0/10) = Ordered the following dishes:

1) Braised beef and tendon noodle soup ($11) = A bowl of harmony created by the right quantity and proportions of fresh noodles, meat, vegetables, and stock.  Noodles were damn good. Beef cooked nicely.  Texture and softness of the tendons done perfectly. 
2) Marinated sliced beef shank ($8) = great cold appetizer of thinly sliced beef. 
3) Pork and crab meat soup dumplings ($8) = I'm impressed! honestly, was not expecting much since I've had it from it's origin of Shanghai.  8 little dumplings with pork/crab meat, without the overwhelming quantity of soup inside.  A lot of places I've been in the US have thicker dumpling dough.  This restaurant's dumplings have thinner wrapping, which I prefer.
4) Taiwanese pork belly slider ($6) = not sure what made this Taiwanese, but what I am sure about is, this pork belly bun is DD - damn delicious.  Pork belly is soft, and cooked long enough so that the fat no longer had the off-putting chewy fat texture.  There is a lot of flavor in the meat.  There is coriander and a crunchy texture as well (ground peanuts?).  What really made this dish stand out was it's size.  I have never seen a pork belly bun this big.  It's slightly larger than the area of my fist (see picture).  I'm impressed.
5) Taro milk tea ($4.50 + $0.50 per additional topping) = this was pretty standard in flavor.  There are other flavors offered. You can add toppings like red beans, mung beans, lychee jelly, and grass jelly as well.

Service (8.0/10) = service was fast and not overwhelming.  Our waiter was nice.  One thing I noticed and thought was nice is how they asked customers if they have had the soup dumplings before.  Reason?  It can be tricky to properly eat these little treats.  Without care, you risk busting the dumplings and wasting all the soup inside.  Eat too early, and you can potentially burn your tongue, screwing up the rest of your dinner and your tongue's ability to send 'flavor' to your brain the next 24 hours.

Ambiance (8.5/10) = I give this a higher score than I usually do, for the ability to watch them make their noodles.  Have you ever tried doing this?  It's hard, and this is why I'm more impressed with finding this place in PGH.  

Overall opinion = as I mentioned, this city is privileged to have a restaurant like this.  I only expected to see such places in California, NYC, Boston, or Philadelphia (i.e places with an incredibly high concentration of Chinese).  So why not slap 5 yelp stars on this review?  Well, I've only been here once, and would like to sample other items on their menu.  Second, the prices are slightly higher than what I'm used to paying in cities such as NYC or Philly (pork/crab soup dumplings ~$7-8, la mien noodles $6-8, milk tea ~$3).  Despite the pricing, I'm still going to visit this restaurant again for sure.",2013-10-06 06:05:42

They have some pretty good specials on weekdays which is why I would like to return soon so I can become more familiar on what days to be a regular. :)

The one thing I did not love too much were the very salty ahi street tacos, they looked perfectly cooked but the flavor killed it for me I Wish they could make mine with no salt or not nearly as much, I felt like I ate a table spoon of salt each bite. :(",2012-08-15 00:45:38

My first trip was during a Las Vegan Eatz Dinner club event, where I (along w/ about 40 other people) enjoyed tastings of EVERY SINGLE VEGAN ITEM ON THE MENU!  I was thoroughly impressed!  While I'm a fan of chick'n & ""beef"" - I do also enjoy when a chef can create fabulously fulfilling delightful and flavorful food - without any of the ""fake"" items.

I've been meaning to go back (like every day since) but the location is a bit outside of my normal travels.  Today at work, it was ""fried food"" day at our company cafeteria/dining room.  I was craving something not so terrible for my diet - I wanted something FEEL GOOD.  So I decided to make the drive over to Bronze Cafe.

It was busy, but not overwhelming.  Seating inside is limited so I took my order to go and ate at the picnic tables outside.  I decided to order my favorite sandwich from my previous tasting event - which was the Guac & Mole.  People rave about it - so I just had to try it.  (PS Paul Graham from Eating Vegan in Vegas did a fantastic review on the joint (and this sandwich) - http://eatingveganinvegas.tumblr.com/post/56611156953/the-bronze-cafe-continues-to-share-the-love )

The Guac & Mole is a vegan sandwich on perfectly baked ciabatta bread (if they don't bake this stuff in house - I want to know where they get it! - filled with avocado, alfalfa sprouts, shredded carrots, cucumber, lemon vinaigrette, vegan mole, and house made vegan ranch.  I realized about half way through the sandwich that I was actually smiling while eating my meal - there you have it, my mouth was happy!

I also took two of their 'bars' to go (but quickly devoured them when I returned to my desk).  I chose the Vegan Almond Apricot Bar (crunchy, chewy, soft, gooey - all of those good things, all rolled into one!) and the Vegan Blueberry Bar (think blueberry muffin, but not greasy w/ a nice crisp top.

What's also great about this place is they also have plenty of non-vegan options for your meat eating friends!

FIVE STARS!  Fresh food, high quality products, unique offerings, and fast service!  I plan to return again and again and again and again.....",2014-01-17 23:19:00

We ordered half a chicken (1 chili), half a dozen spicy wings (2 chilies) and an oyster fried rice (1 chili).  The ingredients were fresh.  The half chicken tasted very spicy to me.  The batter of the half chicken was hard to the bite, but not crunchy.  This was likely because the chicken was soaked in hot sauce.  The chicken wings were labelled as 2 chilies, yet they were less spicy than the half chicken.  They were not battered.  Instead, the wings were marinated in chili flakes, soy sauce and sugar. The result was some devilishly delicious wings.  For both the wings and the half chicken, the sauce or marinate created a level of spiciness and heat, but the flavour didn't numb our taste buds.  I also enjoyed the oyster fried rice, but the flavour was too similar to the chicken dishes, so it didn't stand out to me.  I wished I had ordered something that was not spicy to balance the flavours of the meal.",2015-07-28 23:15:13

Note:  As you may or may not know, one of See's trademarks is to offer everyone a sample.

The first time my hubby and visited was also the first time to try their golden wings. Can we say ""best wings ever""? At least they are IMO. I do not, however, like their fries. Soggy blahness. Onion rings - good. 

The second time we visited was on hubby's birthday. The parking lot was packed and we were in doubt that we'd get a table quickly. But to our surprise there were still a few open tables. This time I had the pepper jack focaccia (chicken, bacon, avocado, pepper jack, garlic mayo). It was sooooo cheesey and delicious. It also came with a side of some sweet jalapeno sauce. It was good, but a bit too sweet. Our friend had the chicken fingers which he was a bit disappointed with. They were battered with that smooth type of batter (I don't know what it's called) and were not very crispy at all. Our entree orders took sooo long that he was able to (after trying our golden wings) switch from regular buffalo to the golden stuff. Friend casually mentioned that it was husband's birthday in front of our waitress and she exclaimed ""oh! Then you get a free desert or shot!"" He couldn't decide on a shot, so told her to surprise him. She brought him a chocolate cake shot. How fitting!

Sausages were cooked perfectly, with a nice blend of tenderness, temperature, and doneness.  We had the wild boar, and the oktoberfest.  We had one that was currywurst style, meaning it came with a mild Indian sauce (delicious).

Top that off with a couple of half pints from a wide selection of taps, and we had it made.  Great for our son that they had a high chair, wide open space, and wasn't crazy packed/loud.

Personally, I love the decor.  The waitress shared that they had a lot of asbestos clean-up and obviously they retained what they could of the original structure and decor.  I totally understand people's aversion to change, but in this case, I really think change is a good thing.

There were so many appealing dishes on the brunch menu, but I had to try the Peach Cobbler French Toast. It was delicious!  The toast was cooked perfectly, which is more than I can say for a number of other French toasts I have tried at various Madison restaurants. The topping was sweet, but not sickeningly so. My husband, who perhaps the most unadventurous breakfast eater ever, chose The Standard with eggs, sausage, toast, and potatoes. He enjoyed it all. I wasn't a huge fan of the spices used on the potatoes, but that's such a personal preference that I would never hold it against them!

My favorite part of the experience was right near the end of our meal when a much older couple, decked out in their Badger red, walked in with their cane and walker and sat right in the booth right behind us, which apparently had been reserved for them. I can only imagine (and hope) that perhaps the Avenue keeps tables reserved for the folks who have been coming there for years, which is so incredibly thoughtful and respectful.  I hope that some day my husband and I will be those old Badger fans frequenting our favorite spot and that they will take care of us as well as The Avenue Club appears to be taking care of it's long time regulars.

My boyfriend took it back to the counter and the manager told the (new?) guy cooking that he's over seasoning the meat. They made us a fresh burger and it was the freshest burger I've ever had at Wendy's. So good! The dining room was the cleanest I think we've ever seen it and it wasn't freezing in there either.

We decided to grab a quick breakfast before leaving Cleveland and BE was the first restaurant we saw. This location looks quite new - it's modern and chic with a sense of 'homey-ness. 

Some highlights of this place:
- Heaps of parking as it's in a plaza
- Very reasonable for a pretty decent breakfast (under $10 for a huge omelet with hash browns, buttered toast, and bottomless coffee)
- Great (and friendly) service
- Free unlimited WiFi

I don't mind coming back for breakfast.

I came to the Orleans Bowling Center for the first time for a UNLV student organization social event, in fact. 

The bowling alley is pretty dated and cell phone reception was nonexistent, which was particularly irksome. 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, nothing worked up here. Doesn't the Orleans Bowling Center know that the devil makes work for idle hands?! :P JK

For a group of about 10 people and to reserve 2 lanes, the total came to an astounding $200+. I was shocked at how expensive it was, I mean, it was a Friday night at 6PM but holy moly! It's not like it was Cosmic Bowling or anything. Luckily for me, my wallet was spared because I only came to spectate. Little know fact - I hate bowling. 

I'll end my rant by commenting on the positives. The alley is old, but clean. The bar dishes out cheap drinks. A 16oz Busch is $1.50 and a 16oz of Bud Light is $2 (offered all day everyday day). Not the best beer in the world but at those prices, who cares? Another plus was that the bowling alley was relatively empty and less rambunctious than most Vegas bowling alleys for a Friday evening. Wait, is that a pro or a con? 

Worth a return visit?
If I have a choice, probably not. Santa Fe Station and Red Rock are my go-to bowling alleys. They're nicer and closer to home, anyways.

It's a tiny spot on the North side of the street that's kind of hard to find; on my visit the windows were fogged over but the signage promised art, community, music, inspiration and of course, espresso within.

You'd have to remark that it's pretty beautiful inside. Concrete floors, marble topped tables, long benches made of logs, walls dappled with found signage and other bric-a-brac. Cool this place definitely is. As you would expect there is a communal table inside, but it was a little lacklustre for something called out in the shop's name. I think it seats about eight, and I wouldn't put it in my top five communal tables in Toronto.

But no matter. In addition to espresso they serve loose leaf teas and nibbles by Circles and Squares. I espied some interesting looking blueberry scones and dulce de leche cookies, but alas, I was only in the market for an espresso that day. I ordered a cortado ($3.25, I believe) and I was surprised that it was made with such a cavalier attitude. Just a shot drowned carelessly in milk, and slid across the counter to me. I don't expect preening and latte art, but the effort was underwhelming fo' sho'.

Still, the CM seems like an excellent (and tirelessly hip) place to show up with a laptop and get some work done. There is free wifi, but outlets are little a harder to come by here. I'd give it another shot.

Obligatory Title Pun: I wonder if this is DON QUIxote's favourite cafÃ©.

Menu Readability: I spotted no less than five chalkboards.

I actually first tried the place because Michael Symon talked about their frites on the food network, so naturally I had to try them. I've had every version now - the more ""naked"" rosemary fries are amazing for potato purists - perfectly seasoned; the gravy fries are my personal favorite because the gravy is just deliciously flavored and a little extra salty, which I love; the animal frites are my hubby's favorite: gravy, mustard, cheese curds, a fried egg all smothering your fries - a complex blend of flavors, so indulgent.

I crave the kale salad - simple, fresh, and crispy. The Caesar salad is also amazing (I like extra garlic and I guess the chef does too!). The wings are to die for, as is the fried chicken (best I've ever had). The lamb burger is melt in your mouth delicious. Basically, it is really hard to not want to order the entire menu!! If they are offering a five course taster that night, definitely go for it.

They have a happy hour as well as a reverse happy hour (late night dining) that's a great way to avoid the big dinner crowd (smaller menu but still always delicious). Service is always on point, the wait staff want you to have a great dining experience and really know the menu well enough to recommend things based on your taste. I once got to sit at the kitchen ""bar"" (you literally sit right at the prep station) which was so much fun and helped us scope out meal ideas for next time!

I went with some friends that ordered various pasta dishes and we got a wide array in portion size. I ordered the duck egg pasta ($21) that looked small at first but it turned out to be a decent portion. The cream and egg yolk sauce made it quite filling as well. The pasta was chewy and the sauce was delicious. 

However, my friends that ordered the tortellini and raviolo did not receive that big of a portion. One piece of pasta for $24 is quite pricey, despite the fact that they got the yolk to ooze out when you cut into the pasta. Even though Buca uses the freshest ingredients, it can become an expensive meal if you want to get full (depending on what you order).

So, today I stopped in to grab some lunch to take back to the office,  and found that the service was pretty slow compared to my other visits to Chipotle.

3 people had apparently ordered online and were now standing around waiting for their orders, which had not been prepared prior to their arrival. This sort of discombobulated  the entire line staff and the cashier.  

When they finally took my order,  things flowed a little better until I got to the checkout.  There I had to wait for awhile so that the cashier could sort & bag the orders for the folks who had ordered online.

I was going out to lunch with a couple of work buddies and meeting up with another friend who suggested we go to Meatballz for lunch. He had been raving about the food for some time and I figured, it's a Friday and I have not yet tried it, so I will give it a shot.  We met at about noon and there was a total of six of us. I was very excited looking over the large menu of various heroes and pastas. 

For those that have never been here, you order at the counter and then the food is brought out to you.  I was the fifth out of six of us to order. 4 people ordered meatball heroes, one person a tuna hero (yes at a place called Meatballz) and I ordered the chicken parm hero and a small drink for $9.12 after the guy at the counter taking the order recommended it over the heroes I was considering. Not the cheapest lunch out there, but for a fresh foot long hero and a drink with free refills it is completely par for the course.  

The six of us were lucky enough to find a table we could all sit at inside . It looks like they may be able to sit about 30 or so folks and there is some seating outside as well.  About 5 to 10 minutes after the last person had ordered, all of the heroes started to come out, except for one. For 5 points can you guess which one? If you said Tuna, you get no points. For those of you that guessed Chicken parm, give yourselves the points. About 30 minutes later and still no sandwich I decided to hit the counter up for an explanation. 

I was told that there was a fresh sandwich coming out of the oven and that it would be out in a moment. By that point I had waited about a half hour, the other five folks I was with had finished or were in the final stretch of finishing their sandwiches so I just asked for my money back.  

Thankfully the guy behind the counter (who is the reason this review has any stars attached to it) was extremely customer service oriented and apologized for the mistake and gave me back my money. Just as I was getting the money back a sandwich did come out from the back but it was too late and I didn't have time to eat nor the desire. I was happy that there was no fuss on returning my cash and let the cashier know that it wasn't his fault that there was a mix up.  

A few moments later the same guy came around the counter and told me he had spoken to his boss and they felt bad. They gave me a 10 dollar gift certificate to come back and try the place again and I appreciate that, but it may be some time before I take them up on the offer. 

There are a ton of places looking for lunch time business and this one is a bit out of the way for me at this point. With restaurants closing in the valley all the time I am sure having unhappy or unsatisfied customers is not something anyone wants. While I do appreciate the attempt at getting me back in, I am going to have to let the bad taste of nothingness leave my mouth first  It is possible at some point I may go back in there, but until that day comes I am going to have to leave this review at a 2 star.",2010-01-08 21:05:00

Upon entering the restaurant, you smell the cooking meat. Like you can open your mouth and chew the air. The kitchen is set up in the center of the restaurant. We weren't seated in a place to easily view it, but the cooking theater certainly creates a savory perfume that makes you want to float over like some Looney Tunes character.

Like any good Mexican place, they serve up tortilla chips and salsa. Both met our approval. My son is autistic and only eats tortilla chips and potato chips in restaurants, and he pretty much inhaled these things.

Then came the difficult decision: which fajitas? They offer chicken, beef, pork, Cadillac (which, to the disappointment of any visiting goats, is not car but beef tenderloin), shrimp, and vegetable. There are a lot of other options, too, and other vegetarian-friendly things, but we were there for MEAT.

We ordered 1/2 pound pork and 1/2 pound Cadillac-style. I asked for corn tortillas along with flour.

A short time later, our food was delivered. The full pound of meat was served upon a mound of grilled onions along with some red and green peppers and a chunk of lemon. On a side dish, they have add-ins like sour cream, lettuce, and pico de gallo.

Then there are the tortillas. Honestly? I'd come here just for the fresh tortillas. They are divine. The flour tortillas have perfect chewiness and can hold a lot of meat. The corn tortillas impressed me in an additional way--since they are fresh, they are flexible. None of that brittle, crack-in-half behavior like standard store ones.

There was much om-nom-nomming. The amount of food was just about perfect for us. The meat had flavor without being spicy; mind you, my husband like super-hot food with a kick, but he still enjoyed this. It's a place I could easily take my parents. 

And those tortillas. Good grief. If I am on my death bed and requesting deliciousness, those are on the top of my list.",2014-12-17 17:59:09

The prices are too good to be true already, but I'm surprised of how they request minimum tip, and I didn't see it when they first opened the business.

As mentioned in other reviews these folks really pride themselves on the entertainment factor with the dancing and singing etc so if you're looking for a unique experience I'd really suggest it because lots of people were having fun. 

However it did seem to take away from the service delivery on the dining side:

We were seated by the Door was which was open on a chilly evening. We asked for the door to be closed or for us to be moved. We were told that the door couldn't be closed (?) but when they realized that they had reservations which prohibited from us being moved they finally closed the door. However at the end of the meal they opened the door again. We were close to the end of the meal so we didn't push the issue but the draft was pretty annoying.

Food comes out as its prepared. Bussers are  very quick to bus your table but they'd take EVERYTHING away so we'd have to ask for additional plates and silverware on a couple of occasions.

We ordered the Brussel sprouts which never arrived. When we asked at the end of the meal to make sure we weren't charged the server said they were still being cooked (over an hour at this point). We paid our bill and the server said the food was still coming even though we weren't being charged. We finished our drinks but after another 15 minutes we were done and still no Brussel sprouts so we left. Not that we were still hungry but still... 

They push Sake bombs pretty hard at this place. I'm no prude by any means and have had more than a few in my day so when the emcee came over to introduce herself and starred pushing them I said we would buy a round if she joined us. She said that sounded awesome and would join us so I bought a round for the table and her. However when the shots came she made up an excuse as to why she couldn't take the shot. No big deal but because of the hard sell we felt like there was a bit of a bait and switch.

These things are all easily fixed and when they are this place will be a solid 4 if you're looking for that kind of vibe and experience. Until then a solid 3.",2016-11-21 20:51:24

I thought it was fine, but nothing special. The cheese they used didn't have a ton of flavor and I thought the home fries had a really weird flavor. The biscuit... which should have been really good.... was not so good. It was not flaky nor did it taste like what I expect from a good biscuit....

First off, the wait on a Saturday was a bit long for a cafe like that, but at the same time, not surprising considering the location. Upon sitting down, they moved us to another table. A bit annoying, but okay since we moved to a more comfortable table.

We ordered the BBQ Pork and Curry Beef Tendons, but both were a bit off. The BBQ was all overcooked, making the meat a bit tough. I personally like my BBQ pork tender with some fat on it, so it was a bit hard to eat. The curry was too sweet, as the balance of flavours was off. With too much sweetness and not even saltiness/spice, it made the curry unbearable. Thankfully, the Milk Tea was quite good, making it the best part of the meal. 

Service wasn't all that great either. I understand working quickly/efficiently to have a faster turnover rate of customers, but you can also be a little nicer. One server was just kinda bitchy when she took our orders.

You don't even have to come in with much of an idea of what you want either. All you need to do is talk to Brian, and he'll show you something you'll like based on a few simple questions for you. He's the most helpful person i've talked to about games, because not only does he have a good depth of knowledge of nearly every game in the store, but he's also very understanding of the fact that not everyone who goes into I'm Board is a game expert (or trying to be one). He was able to help me gauge which games to buy based on the groups of people I wanted to play with, what games we already have, and what budget we were on. He even offered to let us open the games and try them out briefly before we bought them!

Other good things here include:
- A noninvasive loyalty/rewards program that rewards you just for signing up. When you sign up, you get enough points to get $10 off your next purchase.
- A space of tables for playing games. They have several events a month, ranging from casual to competitive to particular game leagues.
- A good selection. Pretty much any board game being sold nationally is sold there. There were some games I didn't find there, but not surprisingly, Brian knew the games in question and informed me that they're in between print versions.

The only con about I'm Board is that a lot of the products can be found for cheaper on Amazon (albeit not much cheaper, usually). But, i'd like to think that the extra cash is being used toward funding the events, and for getting the very useful extra information about the games that I wouldn't find online. This extra information from Brian has always made all of my purchase decisions easier, and i've been very happy with everything i've bought from here.

I also can't deny the glorious orange-y bubbles *ahem, mimosas* that were on special. The just-right mixture of a-little-bit-on-the-strong-side. Oh, yes. 

Then, the menu. It's a great mixture of breakfast classics, healthy options, and badass lunch items. I picked the veggie omelet and then drooled over my boyfriend's blt with an egg. I mean, does it get better than that? Well, yes--when it comes on a croissant. Don't get me wrong, my veggie omelet was fresh and delish with perfectly grilled rye toast. I also loved the option of fresh fruit as a side. Although I snuck a homemade chip from my friend and it was perfectly cooked.

Also enjoyed the Okinawan tea which is black milk tea sweetened with brown sugar. It was a little too sweet even half sweet, but would order again 25% and recommend it to anyone who likes milky teas. 

Boba was nicely cooked and perfectly sweet but had an odd aftertaste. 

Liked the modern look and feel of Brew Tea Bar, the super friendly service, the quick turnaround (no line!), and the price point.

Civic Center is home to several adorable restaurants like AZ 88 and Orange Table, bars like the Blue Moose and Old Town Tavern, the public library, museum of modern art, performing arts center, art sculptures and several ponds and fountains full of ducks. When the weather outside's delightful, the events are anything but frightful. Art fairs, cultural performances and every other type of festival calls the civic center home and in the springtime the Culinary Festival sets up shop here. It's a great area to visit if you want to go on a walk, run, have lunch, enjoy the nice weather and take in the Scottsdale culture-- and yes, Scottsdale has culture! 

It's pretty easy to miss the Civic Center. Little do spring training goers know that there is a great outdoor area just next door to the Giants' Stadium. It's always incredibly clean, safe and there's room for plenty of visitors. Anytime I used to go running through Old Town, I'd be sure to start by running through the Civic Center. It's one of my favorite parts of Old Town. On any given nice-weather weekend, I know that something cultural and entertaining is going on at the Civic Center. The famous LOVE sculpture has been on display and it's an incredibly artsy area.

The sushi was okay. A little too much rice in my honest opinion. Then again we are only paying 11 for AYCE sushi so I guess that's why there's more rice than stuffing. We are two rounds, the AYCE rolls are very basic rolls but again, not gonna complain for the price. It was okay over all. 

Kitchen items, do not get garlic noodles... very disappointing. Don't get the dumplings, also disappointing.  Sure it was too dumplings and I could smell that pork odor, maybe because it was in the freezer too long or because they left it out to thaw a little bit too long before frying it.

Since then, they've had to make adjustments during the economic downturn and have more flexible in allowing non-members to play.

We had a golf outing with a few people in late September. The weather was so/so....clear skies and nice temperature, but the wind howled during most of the front nine holes, so it was a bit of a challenge.  On the back nine though, weather conditions were perfect and it was much more enjoyable.

There are 3 nine hole courses here.  The day we played, the Lakes course was closed for over seeding, so we played the other 2 courses.  They were fun to play for us average golfers, not too challenging and not too easy.

The course is kept in immaculate shape.  The fairways and greens are perfect.  The day we played, the greens were a bit slow and difficult to read, but those are adjustments a golfer must make.  The clubhouse is very nice and comfortable.  After our round, we had a few drinks before meeting up for dinner later.

It was one of two restaurants on the way to our car as we ended a day at the Auto Show at about 6 PM.  I didn't have a big appetite but my friend did, so we chose the Matador of the two places.  Before I even walked in I thought a nice bowl of Albondigas soup sounded good.  The place was empty except for one couple but the host greeted us warmly and showed us to a window table.  Within a minute a server brought us some warm chips and two different salsas ... one chunky and one smooth.  The chips were fresh and the salsas had a rich taste and just the right amount of kick.

When my soup arrived it was in a huge bowl.  At $8.95 it seemed priced right for the quantity of soup.  It didn't look much like any albondigas soup I've had before.  The broth was rather thin and tasted the same way.  It had finely slivered onions and (I think) cabbage, with some tomato pieces, rice and numerous meat balls.  Unfortunately everything tasted kind of bland.  While I would have expected a warm tortilla as a side, instead I received a large plate of refritos.   They tasted okay but seemed to be a strange compliment to the soup.

My friend had a combo plate that was reasonably priced and reported to be tasty.
On quality and authenticity of food, I would say the Matador is about average.  The quality of service, especially considering the place was empty, it was a Sunday night, and I'm sure the staff would rather have been at home, was excellent.  One of the owners spoke with us twice, she was obviously very concerned what we thought of her restaurant.  She was a very pleasant lady.

I would go back but not so much for a fine dining experience but to have a reasonably priced meal that's pretty decent.  But as far as albondigas soup ... I think I'll make my own.",2011-12-03 19:05:25

The food needs a lot of work. I have tried:

-Shoyu and Miso Ramen: The broth was very bland and the noodles were too hard. You know it's bad when you feel like you can make a tastier bowl of instant ramen at home. 
-Gyoza: tasted like one of the frozen brands that you can buy at the grocery store. 
-California Roll: it was okay. I mean, it's hard to screw up a California Roll right?
-Furikake Fries: interesting concept, but the furikake does not stay on the fries. They might as well just serve regular fries only. 
-Honey Toast with Ice Cream: probably their best menu item. Nice presentation, tasty and not too sweet. 

The service also needs a lot of work. Other than our very first visit, the servers have been horrible. We either always have to ask for drink refills or we get nothing at all.

I've always gone the custom route which includes some variety of avacado, lettuce, tomatos, fried egg, grilled onions, and chipotle sour cream (which is no longer on the custom menu, but you can still order it). And I always get the black peppercorn rub. When I do have room for a shake, which isn't often, I really enjoy the peanut butter shake (fluffer nutter? I can't remember off the top of my head).

In comparison to other burger establishments in the area, they really lack on their sides. Chips are ""OK"" but always seem to be rock-hard and you usually only get 1 or 2 sweet potato chips. Fries are sub-par and try as I might, I do not like their ""organic"" side salad option.

Some of my bigger complaints is how they prepare your burger. It doesn't matter what temperature state you order your burger (pink, some pink, no pink), it ALWAYS comes in-between pink and some pink, which means blood soaking up in the bun. I was even advised to order ""no pink"" on my last visit, to which I did, and it still was almost rare. 

And from a custom menu standpoint, I don't understand some of their pricing - the burger is certainly big, but $1.00 for grilled onions? Especially when they are just purple onions that have barely been sauteed, let alone caramelized.

My Experience:  
Would never have thought that I would find such an amazing shawarma place up north from Toronto, but this restaurant really shines. Amazing chicken shawarma and gyro, very fresh and flavourful. 

We got the shawarma plate, and boy was it packed. A box filled to the brim with rice, potatoes, chicken shawarma, hummus and salad. It could fill one hungry person or even two mildly hungry people. 

The service was impeccable, very friendly. The restaurant was very clean and had a comfortable atmosphere.",2017-10-02 22:03:19

The ingredients they have are in the premium side of quality and the service is always expedient and friendly. The atmosphere is warm and cozy and usually is filled with a mix of people on dates and families.

The fresh garlic bread that they give you is a great start. It is garlicy and warm, careful not to fill up before your meal! It is super tempting.

Appetizers, both the breaded and grilled calamari is as you would expect which is good but not spectacular. Their Caesar Salad comes with fresh and crisp lettuce and is great to start with. I hate it when restaurants drench their salads in dressing and luckily they have never done this to me here.

For those who like veal, I've had the veal in peppercorn sauce, veal parmigiano, and the veal marsala. They are all tasty and filling with a stressor on filling. Make sure you're hungry or you're taking some home

The grilled salmon is my daughter's favourite dish. The fish is always cooked perfectly and the rice is a flavourful accompaniment. 

Their pizzas are just the way I like it, think crust, light on the sauce with plenty of imaginative toppings.  The Chiffonade and Bacon pizza is a great departure from the usual.  The spinach pairs well with the salty bacon fontina and provolone cheeses.  No tomato sauce on this one, so perfect for those who do not love sauce on their pizza all the time.  The Puttanesca Pizza is our second favourite that is a great explosion of vegetarian flavour.",2015-01-19 02:56:52

1) From the stands.
2) From the field.

I've had occasion to do both. Actually, before my first CFL game, I had only experienced McMahon from the field.

See, the Calgary Ultimate Association has McMahon booked as one of its game fields. On occasion, we got to make our way into the empty stadium and play on the turf under the watchful eye of the groundskeeper (note: if you're ever playing on the field, be mindful that you can't have anything but water with you. I had nothing but Gatorade my first time out and it was confiscated until we left). It's even more fun when it starts getting dark out and the gigantic field lights come on. That place stays well lit until 1030pm.

From the stands, the stadium looks a lot bigger than it does from the field. The thousands of people milling about may have something to do with that. On a cold day (like today, it was -20 C), it's noticeable just how much of the stadium is outdoors - pretty much all of it. If you go to watch a game and it's November, dress warm, bring a blanket, and don't forget some extra glove and boot warmers. If you can find a padded seat warmer, you'll be doing yourself a tremendous favour as well.

Two last things: 1) There's a bathroom at the far north end of the east side of the stadium (I guess that would make it the far northeast corner). It's out of the way enough not to have the same lineup that the main washrooms do. Try it instead. 2) You can use beer tickets or cash in the lineup for hi-balls. You'd be better off just with cash though, then there's only one lineup to wait in.",2010-11-22 08:01:03

Moonstones is deceptively small looking from the outside, but on the inside there are as many things to see as there are spiritual paths.

I had assumed that what I needed would be an ornate crystal pendulum, but ""great things come in small packages"". After I took it home it took no time to get acquainted with it. 

The store contains many crystals, gems, jewelry, oils, and even jars of dried herbs. There were around 60 different bumper stickers to chooses from. And hard to find matchstick incense. It is exactly what you think, a match you strike that burns as incense. Speaking of which, I was disappointed to not find any ""pick your own"" incense sticks. My supply is quite depleted, and I need more. I did but a very dainty scarf from the selection of hats and clothing on the top most floor of the labyrinth. 

I hope to attend one of the interesting classes that I have seen mentioned. It does appear that the list needs to be updated.

We walked up to the line and like a few others needed a moment to review and decide. This caused a confusion because the order area is small and the employees dont direct or assist very well. Wifey ordered kitsune udon and I opted for the big dog nabeyaki udon.

Wifey was direclty handed hers while i was given a little beeper device. We moved onto the tempura and what not's. 

The tempura all looked as if it had been out for awhile.. soggy and not much left. Not a great sign considering they had just opened.. microwaved from the night before?

I wanted to have two pieces of sweet potato but there was only two so I left one for the next guy. Grabbed a few items and went to sit down. 

Figured udon would be right out so I started to munch on the few items I got. Well, by the time the beeper went i was done. Ran up and got the pot in awkward hand off and made it back to table without spilling hot soup on any og the customers. Seems like the kind of thing liability would dictate the employees bring to you.

This was the first time i have ever had sukiyaki flavored tempura udon with beef in it. Gross.  I must add, typically when you are going to drop a raw egg you should bring the broth to a tempature that could atleast have a chance to cook the egg white. 

The line was so long it wasent worth going back up to order anything else.

I am pasty white pale (it's the irish in me), and I contacted Angie for a test tan before my best friend's wedding in Australia.  Wanted to make sure I did not look totally unnatural.  Angie was attentive to detail and did a great job.  I did not look orange or fake looking at all.  I even got a lot of compliments at work.  Of course I had to book her to be spray tanned before the wedding, and I was on a bit of a time crunch with packing and getting things ready.  Even though I had already scheduled a time with her, I was able to get out of work early and she was able to fit me in on a busy day, which was great because I was able to keep the tan on longer before I needed to rinse off.  Even though the professional pictures have not come back from the wedding, I have a lot of pictures that people took at the wedding, and the tan looked great. I will definitely go see Angie again for special events and other occasions where I need to avoid looking washed out and pasty!  Thanks Angie!!  You are great!",2013-05-09 00:05:19

The service was good. Friendly server and quick enough service.

We ordered a saucy chicken dish and rosemary naans. The chicken didn't arrive particularly hot (just warm) which surprised me a little but not a big deal. It was pretty tasty. The rosemary naans were just normal naans with dried rosemary sprinkled on top. Kind of meh.

The beer list was good, not your typical big brand products, and arrived fairly quickly and cold.

My one big complaint was the wasp problem. We spent our entire meal swatting them away from our meals. Is this the restaurant's fault? Debatable. I'd say yes only because there were dirty dishes at abandoned tables lying all over the patio. In other words lots to attract and feed those pesky wasps.

Anyway, pretty average place. The Market Place is right across the street and has much better reviews so it's probably worth going there instead.",2011-09-26 19:58:56

Its one of the better indoor play places for kids.  Great mix of jungle gyms, fun slides, small trampolines along w/ areas for pretend play & building w/ foam toys & duplos.  I would say its probably ideal for toddlers & kiddos ages 3 to 6yrs although they allow for ages 1 to 10yrs.  The thing that sets this indoor play place apart from other places are the super awesome shiatsu massage chairs, free to use for the parents for a 20 minute session.  After about 2 hours of running around w/ my son in the play area I propped myself down in one of the chairs for a massage.  Let me tell ya, when I got up I felt like a new woman, just so revived it was awesome.  I topped it off w/ a free cup of coffee and felt great.  There were a fair amount of kids there this afternoon but the play area is pretty large so it didn't feel overwhelmingly crowded.  The ""parent's lounge"" area seemed a lot more crowded more than anything, lots of mom's yip yapping it up w/ their bottoms glued to all the seats.  I did see a handful of lil one's unsupervised in the play area this afternoon, could be a little dangerous especially on the trampolines but to each their own...I guess.  My son played for about 2 & 1/2 hours and had a blast the entire time.  We ended up upgrading our $10 one day visit into a 10 visit pass for $55 more.

On to the negative: our server was very nice, but he disappeared for about 15 minutes while we were waiting for the check. When he returned, he said he had to answer the phones but he smelled like he had been taking a smoke break...not cool.

Upside was the next service employee we dealt with (our server) was nice and fairly attentive. She provided us with recommendations when asked since it was our first time eating at Perch. However she gave so many options we still had a hard time narrowing things down. 

Now on to the food... This is the reason that score is so low. Its was mediocre unfortunately. I had the infamous Perch burger and it was not that fabulous. I felt it was somewhat bland to have a fried green tomato on it.

Their chicken was very moist and flavourful. Although, the chicken on my dish was a lot saltier then the fried chicken in another dish. But the flavour combos were very delicious.

I've been fairly critical of the new, hip burger restaurants that have been gaining notoriety over the last couple of years. Primarily because they undelivered in service. The Habit nailed it!

Don't get me wrong. There are lots of good burgers out there and I've acknowledged that. However, The Habit Burger Grill is one of the few that provides a unique burger, nice atmosphere and great service. (Pay attention Burger Theory!)

A number of people I know have all told me The Habit was their favorite burger joint. Based on those recommendations and the fact they opened a new location in Avondale, my hockey amigo and I decided to check out The Habit for dinner.

I like the fact that the menu is simple (think ""upscale In-N-Out""). Hey! They are both burger chains based in California. They both focus primarily on burgers, but there is enough variety on the menu to keep you interested. There is a fried chicken sandwich, a tuna fillet sandwich and some amazing side options.

I chose the house specialty Double-Char burger with cheese and classic lettuce & tomato toppings. It's simple, cooked perfectly to order and really delicious. It's not the BEST burger I've ever had, but it's really close. My companion's burger had me feeling jealous. He made his a wrap (with lettuce and no bun). His was a single, but he added a grilled portobello mushroom and cheese. He absolutely loved it!

At the same time, their broth is not as rich and may contain MSG (having consumed about half the bowl of soup, my mom became quite thirsty). Moreover, there is some alkaline taste to the noodles - although this is very slight and minimal. Finally, the portions are smaller - and an extra $1 provides two toppings but there's only one extra topping given, whereas Wonton Chai Noodle offers the same additional portion for an extra $0.50 only.

On the other hand, I didn't find their broth to be as salty. The dace fish balls were also not as salty, and the wontons were very tasty as well! I have slight gluten sensitivity, but wasn't very affected by Jim Chai Kee.

No it's still not as good as the real thing in Philadelphia, but it is as close as I've had especially out here.  The pricing is so cheap, and if you're really hungry they offer a 24 inch option.  Yes that's 2 feet of amazing deliciousness!  

It's easy to miss this place, as it is located inside the gas station.  However if you're hungry don't overlook this amazing establishment.  

The bread was full of flavor, the steak was cooked well and mixed great on the griddle with the peppers, onions, mushrooms, and cheese.  The steak was full of flavor, and the toppings were a perfect addition.  The first bite was like meeting an amazing memory of taste of the best cheesesteaks I've had in my life.  Subsequent bites were enough to convince me that I will be back whenever I'm looking for a cheesesteak.

The only downer- though the gas station is always open, the Cheesesteak shop is not.  You have to catch this deliciousness between ""normal"" lunch and dinner hours.  Sadly they're not open at 5am when I'm getting out of work and looking for a quality cheesesteak.",2015-09-24 12:00:41

After ordering the smoked trout and bacon guacamole, I think I would've given Momocho 5 stars if they served me a soft taco from Taco Bell as my entree..the guac was that impressive!

The smoky flavor of the trout and bacon came through absolutely perfectly without overpowering the other flavors at all- I'm sure even the normal guacamole is incredible; whatever their base ingredient ratio is seems to be spot on for perfect, creamy guacamole with just the right amount of avocado to spiciness. 

For my entree I ordered the shrimp taquitos which were very good but honestly completely overshadowed by the guacamole. The shrimp were cooked nearly perfectly and the garlic sauce was good- not great. The portion was also a little smaller than I'd like usually but after loading up on guac and pico de gallo (also very fresh and excellent tasting) it was just right. The service was superb, and I heard the margaritas were excellent as well.",2014-10-12 01:53:55

4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Dutch crunch bread!  Zapp's potato chips!  These two things alone keep this place at 4 stars.  I just can't give it a 5 despite these because I've had other, better, amazing sandwiches, but these are pretty darn good.

I do't care that the Dutch crunch kind of falls apart and roughs up the roof of your mouth, I love the texture.  So, so many sandwiches to choose from.  Good because I love variety.  Bad because it leads to consumer choice freeze - too many options, don't know what to do.  It's easily overcome.

I've had the Tony Soprano (ham, salami, turkey, provolone, Italian dressing).  It's fine, I could do without the turkey.  It's not a great Italian sub, but it's still a tasty sandwich.  Also had the Lizzy's Lips (halal chicken, pepper jack, Italian dressing).  This was an interesting combination and it, too, was mighty tasty.  Little kick from the pepper jack, little tart saltiness from the dressing, with decently cooked, not-too-dry chicken.  It's a ""healthier"" option I suppose.

Interestingly enough, this is the only Valley location I've been to even though there's one closer to home.  And I'll try it, assuming I will like it, because again.  Dutch Crunch.  Zapp's potato chips.",2016-05-31 18:59:54

Otherwise, service was excellent - polite, useful, fast. Better that at Kokyo, which effectively makes it one of the best in the whole Downtown Toronto. Food quality was exceptional, and the only reason for me not to give this place a five stars rating is that painful lack of space.

Prices are right, portions are huge, menu is elaborate and quality of ingredients and resulting food is an absolute A-grade. The only suggestion to them will be to have an option for a smaller rolls - those huge ones look impressive but take quite a bit of effort to eat them in one piece. :-)

Bestellen (which means ""to order"" in German) Is the new venture of Top Chef Canada finalist Rob Rossi and his parter Ryan Sarfeld. They are both young but have some decent experience and apparently quite the eye for design. The space looks gorgeous. Rustic reclaimed wood, a ""peek-into"" meat locker, chalkboard walls and an impressive mural comprised of meat bits along the wall of the dining room. Part apocathacary, part lumberjack shack and at the same time very modern, the decor is thoughtful and was well received by my party. A large harvest table (seats 12) sits adjacent to the open kitchen along the back of the space. 

My friends and I rolled in at just before 9 and had a seat at the bar. Being a soft opening we had a choice of 2 beer and 3 wine, or two cocktails. I chose the house red and it was a good choice. Once seated, we perused the menu (a condensed version for the occasion) and basically ordered one of everything. 

Charcuterie was fantastic. Really Really good and a steal at $13. We will definitely be ordering this regularly. For starters, the other stand out was the fried cheese curds with smoked ketchup, that were so great we ordered a second round. Caramel popcorn was decent but more of a bar snack. 

Also ordered by the party were the burger and fries which came cooked medium on a fresh baked brioche. A little under seasoned, but really good none-the-less. Benefited heavily by the smoked ketchup we had sent from the kitchen. The brussel sprouts and duck fat potatoes were tasty sides. For the non-meat eaters, there was a delicious pasta dish and (on special that eve) a trout which was perfectly cooked. 

Even though we are all completely stuffed, we tucked into two bread puddings baked in mini mason jars for dessert. Bottles of wine ran us $45 a piece. 

Service was exceptionally good. Prices were extremely reasonable. The one $40 main (an aged steak), we were assured, was large enough to feed two people. The others were all in the $18-25 range. We ate and drank like complete fools (wanted to try everything!)  with several bottles of wine, beers and cocktails and the bill was about $150 a couple. 

This is just the beginning for Bestellen which is amazing. If mediocre ""hot spots"" like Enoteca Sociale can be completely full every night I can not even imagine how popular Bestellen will be. I am really excited to see how this goes. 

This place reminds me very much of  my favourite restaurant in Montreal La Salle Ã Manger and that is a very good thing. 

Highly Recommended.",2012-02-02 19:09:40

Chinato may not seem like the hippest or trendiest kid on the block, but its dishes certainly rise with the tide of culinary excellence sweeping the city.   We tried three dishes at Chinato at the end of our restaurant and bar crawl, and came away feeling like it may have been the best stop on a tour that included Lola and Greenhouse Tavern.  The raw scallop ""crudo"" with extra virgin olive oil and lemon zest, a sashimi-meets-italian kind of appetizer, came out wafer-thin with a melt in the mouth texture.  The homemade gnocchi with butter, parmesan, basil and tomato, a shining example of comfort food done well, was our entree option (I wish all gnocchi were like this: small, misshapen, chewy bites tossed in a minimalist sauce with a few accenting ingredients.  Only 10 bucks for a generous half-order!)  Tiramisu was our choice for dessert.  The tiramisu preparation opted for a ladyfinger ""wafer"" between two layers of mascarpone creme rounded out like a mini cake, rather than the traditional layering of individual cookies with creme poured over the top.  Light and not too sweet; a nice riff on an old classic. 

Overall, Chinato left us feeling like we ended things on a high note, and that further trips to the eatery would be mandatory.   Greenhouse Tavern and Lola do wonderful things with their eclectic, all-over-the-board menus; there are times, however, when the palate craves places like Chinato, whose gastronomic identity is still very much grounded in the comforting and familiar flavors of a national cuisine.",2013-08-03 21:51:22

It was enough for me to stop by both times I've been to Indian Land in the last two weeks.

Walked in last week around 1pm to a relatively crowded small restaurant. It's about the size of your average Chinese take-out but with nice tables and a long high-top in the middle. The counter is clean and modern, with large TV screens featuring their menu choices.

On my first visit I got the Arroz Con Pollo: Yellow Rice, Shredded Chicken, and mixed vegetables. Also served with your choice of a side, I got the sweet plantains. Rice and chicken was fantastic, moist and full of flavor. The sweet plantains were dialed back on the sweetness, kind of refreshing compared to a lot of Latin American restaurants around here. Served with a tangy and spicy sauce, the former similar to a chimichurri sauce.

Second visit I went for the Lunch Special and for the price it was good. You get a soup, choice of a protein, and two sides. The soup today was Chicken soup. It had a wholesome flavor and seasoned nicely, but I only found one sliver of chicken. Would have been better listed as a Veggie and potato soup. The chicken was lacking  a lot of flavor on its own, much different from the portion served in the Arroz Con Pollo, but also a cheaper menu option.

The squid was so fresh and tender, the tomato sauce had a deep richness and sharp spice, and the peas (courtesy of Tuscany) were a stroke of regional genius. You'll never eat fried squid again - this is the only way to go. We ordered the garlic bread to sop up every drop of tomato sauce.

We tried the bruscetta which is prepared on the most wonderful bread you will ever taste. My wife said it is from Willo? I'm not sure ,but I was thinking maybe heaven?

I talked to someone on the phone AND through email about doing so and nothing was ever mentioned about having to be a full time student to take advantage of student pricing. Nobody is on the same page lately. They are about to open a ton more locations. Quality going a bit down if you ask me. I hope Tru doesn't get cocky. I really hope they stay humble and focus on quality, not quantity.. I don't know if it's going that route. Even though I've enjoyed the past year there, not sure I'll sign back up. Studios always get you in the door with great pricing and then they up it 20 or more a month or 200 or more a year on an annual membership.They tend to focus on getting new people in the door, but not customer retention! I thought this place would be different when it comes to that..",2015-08-31 14:34:31

The lady next to me had just ordered the Border Burger and it looked super tasty, so we decided to split it.  I can honestly say it is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  It is a half pound burger with cheese and guacamole with onion, banana pepper, lettuce and maybe a little cilantro!   The burger came with onion rings which could be even better than before.  

So, we ate and the bar started to empty out a little bit.  The manager stopped by to say ""hi"" and thank us for stopping in.  We always feel welcome and like we belong there whenever we visit.   

One other observation is that all the employees seen to work as a team.  We noticed the bar manager taking food out to the people on the patio.  The manager was involved in the kitchen area and also serving food.  Everyone was making sure that the customers were happy.

Boy did they do a 360 for the worse. They still have the $19.99 special with a players card. The menu has changed a bit. They got rid of a lot of stuff that was really good and added a lot of fillers mainly flat breads and sliders. 

They added sushi onto the menu but heres the problem with that, my friend ordered a roll and you'd expect a freshly made one but what he got was a sushi roll made who knows when that just came out of the fridge. Also when you read the fine print on the new menu it says along the lines that sushi may not be available depends on their supplier or something. So the sushi is not made on the spot it's made somewhere else and brought in and refrigerated. 

All the tasty items like the miso bass now has an added charge of $4.00
additional on top of the $19.99 you just paid. I ate like 20 of those the last time. 

any item worth eating has an additional charge per item.

So basically you will pay $19.99 base price then another ala cart price on top of that. WOW.

If you still are dying to try this place read the menu carefully before entering the restaurant and you will see what I mean. 

Also by the way besides the price, the food quality has gone way down. Nothing tasted like it was freshly made like before, tasted microwaved. Would make a great episode of kitchen nightmare where Gordon Ramsey makes a visit.",2011-09-27 08:33:35

I've lived in Korea and adore the food and the people have always been more or less lovely to me, so I was excited to find a restaurant that felt nostalgic for my time there. The tang su yuk comes as a mountainous portion of tasty goodness! The meat is crisp and coated in a generous amount of batter. The vegetables were great- the onions were soft and sweet, the peppers crisp, and pineapple made a welcome addition. They give you the choice of having your sauce on the side or poured, we went with poured. Plenty of banchan joined the party with seasoned beansprouts, boiled peanuts, cabbage and cucumber kimchi, a seaweed salad, etc... I got a bowl of jjajangmyun too which came with pickled radish, raw onions and the tasty blackish dip that was ubiquitous at the little eateries I popped into while in/around Seoul. Noodles were springy and the sauce was plentiful. It seemed a popular option among the other diners there during our visit. For the amount of food we had, and how many extras our sweet waitress threw in to our take out bag, I feel we paid a fair price. They have lunch specials and tons of other dishes I look forward to trying. Antho really enjoyed the tang su yuk and agreed that we'll be back.",2018-02-03 01:22:03

First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. 

First, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. 

For lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). 

Finally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.",2009-03-04 03:49:27

The already limited selection was further limited for me, because almost every item had some sort of edible glitter! Am I the only one who is reminded of metal shavings when there is shiny stuff on my food? Perhaps. In any case, I got a slice of cake that was described to me as a cake version of a ""cannoli,"" and a macaron. The cake itself was nice and moist, but all together, it was overly sweet - too much frosting, not enough cake.  Also, the slab of sugar (frosting) separated from the layer of cake when I was ""knifing"" it with the side of my fork for a bite, which kind of turned me off - that typically happens when the cake is dry, and has been left out for a while, which it didn't seem to be.

I didn't finish the slice, and didn't bother trying the macaron at that point - I think my roommate may have helped himself to it. The person behind the counter said A Bakeshop is known more for its cookies, so maybe I just didn't have the right expectations going in as I was jonesing for a decadent, cakey treat.

2) Food - Pretty bland broth. It tastes like regular pho broth, but cut with water. My sister in law said this is the style she's used to eating when she's at her boyfriends. It's more ""homestyle"" I suppose.

3) Cleanliness - I did have a small issue with the cleanliness. Some of the lettuce served was dirty and had some bugs on it. No matter, just pick it off and keep on eating. 

Overall, I knew what I was getting into and I wasn't expecting too much out of this place. The food was light and bland but it hit the spot. The meal was cheap and the service was just okay. I probably would come back, but only if I can't find anywhere else to eat at 3:30 AM.

From the quizzical looks I get when I wear my Cesc Fabregas Arsenal jersey in public, to the ""huh?"" I get from bartenders at other bars when I ask if they can put a soccer match on, being a soccer fan is sometimes like being the red-headed stepchild.

Which is why I love this place so much.  Simply put, this is the best British Pub I have ever been to.  It isn't a big bar by most standards, but it's very homely and it just feels warm to be inside.  They have pool, darts and foosball for those interested in bar games.  They do have video poker like in most bars these days, but this is a bar better for socializing or watching a match than playing poker.  

I just got back today from watching Arsenal play Barcelona in a UEFA Champions League match, and while the place was pretty empty when I got there 20 minutes before match time, practically all the seats were taken by kickoff.  The British Burger I ordered was absolutely delicious, and next time I must try the fish and chips.  Even though it was noonish, the people watching the match were rowdy and fun, and despite the intensity of a hugely important match were for the most part friendly.  While the fans are passionate and intense, you probably don't have to worry about brawls breaking out.

The only bad thing I can say about this place is that the parking lot of quite small and cramped.  If you're going here to watch a match, be sure to get there early, as it fills pretty fast, particularly if it's a popular club or country playing (I.E. Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal or England's National Team).  Besides, the smaller lot probably encourages designated driving, so you can experience those many beers and get home safely :)

The menu is simple but focuses on classic dishes and some sushi rolls: we opted for the grilled squid, the drunken noodles with shrimp, and the Twilight roll. 

The GRILLED SQUID was the best of our dishes: plated beautifully and served with a delicious sweet thai sauce that left us wanting more, just the perfect amount of char on it for flavor. A very simple, classic dish done very well. I'd come back for that dish.
The DRUNKEN NOODLES: the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the portion of noodles wasn't too overwhelming. We ordered a 4 on the 1-10 spice scale and it had good heat without overpowering the dish. The bits of crunchy basil were a nice touch that added to the otherwise homogenous texture of the dish.
TWILIGHT ROLLl: again, beautifully plated, with slices of lemon stuck between the pieces of sushi. The roll itself was on the light side in terms of size and flavor, I felt like it was missing something; but given the ingredients (cream cheese and tempura shrimp among them) I liked that the dish didn't weigh me down or feel overly fatty.

Also snagged the free thai tea with Yelp check in. I was surprised to see how good this place was, considering they were completely empty during dinner- this is a place that's out of the way for me, and I'm hoping they find a way to pick up business and stay open.

I purchased a voucher off kgb for $8 after a discount from a previous deal. That gave me 30$. Drove down with my bf and was a little turned off with the location (in a strip mall). After finding a nice seat on the patio we felt like we were in a nice scottsdale/dt phx area. They position the umbrellas to block the parking lot/strip mall behind you. I ordered a glass of pinot and my bf got run&coke for drinks. We ordered a large caprese salad to share ($10.99). It was great! They had a small for $7.99 and this large one. It is a really great size, especially for a caprese salad, the basil was super yummy too! We ordered a large (12$ + 2$/additional topping) with mushrooms, kalamata olives, and half jalapenos (for him) and other half ricotta cheese (for me). It came out and we were in shock - it was HUGE! After our first bites we were addicted! It tasted so authentic and delicious. I can't wait to go back for that exact meal! The waitress was really nice and I was impressed how technologically advanced they were as they took orders on there iphones! Very cool! 
We even think there pizza is better than CIBO (which we thought would be hard to beat). Super impressed with this little restaurant & can't wait to go back again :)",2011-04-24 04:17:55

I had the worst stomach-ache ever after eating here. Seriously, the ONLY time I have EVER thought I might throw up after eating a meal!

I was the only person eating here at about 6:00 PM for buffet, if that says anything. 

Selection was poor, but tasted OK. Waiter/owner suggested an Indian beer (I had never had one) and turned out to cost like $18 (yes it was an oversize bottle, but still!)

There was a bug in my cup of water also...

India Oven in Mesa is SO much better and still worth the drive!",2013-06-25 00:34:00

First, let me admit that I bought a LivingSocial deal to this place and accidentally let it expire on Sept 3rd.  Knowing this, I called the restaurant and spoke with Jerry the manager.  After I told him the deal expired, he told me, ""Don't worry about it, we will still take it."" He was extremely pleasant on the phone and I presumed that he meant that the full deal would still be honored. 

On the same day that I called and spoke with Jerry the manager, I went over to Garcia's.  After sitting down at my table, the server told me that she can only accept the ""paid value"" for the deal (which is the amount that I already paid) and that it will be deducted from my bill.  I explained that this was not my understanding after talking to Jerry the manager, but she said that she, ""just talked to Jerry about it.""  

While I did not ask for Jerry (because sometimes I just don't feel like fighting), I am very displeased at the miscommunication that took place here.  I am deducting four stars for this whole debacle.  

With all of that said, the pollo fundido was very good (even though my spellcheck keeps changing it to ""pool funded"")... and the house margarita helped to turn my frown upside down... but the crowning moment of this visit was the fried ice cream.  Took me back to my childhood and all was good again.  For Garcia's Mexican Restaurant, this means I added a star back.

I'd go back because of the food and fried ice cream, but not the service.",2013-10-25 21:13:24

I have tried the Paisita hot dog, which is a meal in itself, and the Colombian.  I have never ever been disappointed with their food.  The service is great!  They are friendly an attentive.

It just didn't feel like entering a restaurant.  It seemed more like some other kind of space...with tables.

That said, the food, for the most part, was perfectly fine.  Up front I'll say that there were 6 of us.  (A 7th came 40 minutes later, but I won't figure her service into this review.)   The service  and prep time was their major weakness.  It was slow.  Without getting into details (and I have them...I made notes), my eggs, home fries etc., came 7 minutes after my toast.  The waitresses (accurately described by others), did a good job keeping our coffees filled,  but otherwise seemed reluctant to take our orders.

The staff here have no interest in their customers and find it's more important to carry on conversations with each other than creating a positive customer experience. 

I already heard bad things about this Starbucks but decided to try it out. My first interaction with them was in the winter and I ordered a passion tea lemonade hot. I've ordered this drink at other Starbucks and one in henderson actually gave me the idea of making it hot one visit when I wasn't feeling well and had no issues. This time the barista told me ""we can't do that"" kindly explained to her that other Starbucks have done it they steam the lemonade she replied very rudely ""well we don't do that at this Starbucks it ruins our machine."" I was completely caught off guard with her tone of voice and unwillingness to help. I placed my order for a different drink. My second encounter was a few months later, I thought I'd give it another chance. I went through the drive thru placed my order went to the window and the barista was leaning on the wall had a very lazy presence and was talking into the store to her other coworkers as I pulled up. She looked and me, told me my total and then continued her conversation with her coworkers. I handed her my phone to scan my card during this time she's still continuing her conversation. She hands me my drinks says ""thanks"" closes the window and immediately walks away. 

Needless to say two bad experiences are two to many. I have my own stories my roommate has lived on this side of town longer than I have and she has even more. I will never go back to this Starbucks. They really have some shaping up to do within their staff. Good luck",2014-06-29 05:42:04

They make everything in house and they are very responsible about getting their food source locally (or not too far of distance away). We picked to eat here two weeks in a row...crave worthy. We got three of their specials: baby back ribs, pork, and trout. All the dishes were cooked to perfection! What I appreciated the most was that they paired the sides so well...from risotto to horseradish mashed potatoes, to a mixed couscous. I also ordered their shrimp, andouille sausage and grits...oh my gosh, the flavor was phenomenal! 

It's definitely comfort food and you'll want to stay and ""savor"" every bite. I absolutely loved their blackberry and peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top! My mouth is watering...is yours?! The coffee was great too. Beer selection was good and on the night we went they were all $2. Love the specials!

One more greeting was coming soon from our waitress. She was a very nice but not overly familiar, just like I like it. Her service was spot on. 

Gus and I each had a burger and to my surprise it tasted like a real burger. Mine was called The Works Burger which means it comes with stuff I never have on a burger. It was supposed to have a sauce on it, this was left off, not by request. I could have asked for it, but decided to eat it as is and it was good. The onion rings that came with it were also very well cooked, nice and crisp. Speaking of onions, although there are grilled onions on this burger it also has raw on the side.

I tried one other barber shop before, that was coincidentally next door in the other little shopping, area across the street. They did a horrible job! So, I decided I would try T&C next time, as I had seen it in passing. The other shop didn't last much longer after I had made the switch, which is no surprise, I'm sure the competition from T&C was too much for them. 

All the barber's here are masters of their craft. They probably have about 1,000 years experience between all of them!! Talk about old school ;) The guys in the shop are very friendly and do good work. They always greet you as you come in & as you leave. The shop is always clean & well maintained. They are definitely grateful to their customers & appreciate every ones business. The guys all have their loyal customers too, that come in specifically for their favorite barber. Myself included ;) 

The barber I usually go to is, Efren. He is a professional in every sense of the word! He is a Maestro, if you will ;) He is pretty much the heart & soul of this shop. He is an entertaining & all around fun guy. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else or letting anyone else cut my hair but him. That, & I get a Military discount, so it's $15. Not bad, in my opinion ;)

Overall, this place is great! They cut every ones hair, from lil boy's to elderly ladies who prefer a shorter 'do :P They even hand out free lollipops if your good too! Nice place to come get your haircut in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. This place can really get packed too, but its hit or miss on when the best time to come in is. I usually have pretty good timing, however I have had to wait over an hour & even run some errands & come back. But, it is definitely worth the wait, for me & I would gladly do it anytime, for a quality haircut & great service. So, make sure you tip these guys well, because they deserve it ;)

P.S. It is cash only, however they do have an ATM inside the shop ;)

I went back today and had the meal replaced and the general manager got the gift card that Ben had set aside for me and took care of everything. Not only was the order perfect, but it was one of the best to-go meals I've had from King's in the 15+ years I've been visiting. Even the cashier who helped me was super friendly and helpful. 

Just an all around good experience. This is how customer service should be done!",2017-01-28 04:02:30

Being a dumpling restaurant, their dumplings are freshly made as you can see the ladies wrapping them up near the kitchen. The steamed dumplings are yummy and there are a good selection to choose from- various pork choices, beef, lamb, chicken and vegetarian. Their pork fried dumplings  are tasty and crispy. I recommend the fried dumplings with pork and leek. The price for these items are really cheap from $3.99 to approx. $5 per dish. The value is all there since you get 15 steamed dumplings in a bamboo steamer.
The reason that this place got a 3 star is because of their noodle dish. We ordered pickled vegetables with shredded pork noodle soup. The noodles you could tell was freshly made and pretty standard and good; however the soup and topping was not at all. It was tasteless and super bland. I really expected more from this as many dumpling places also serve this item. 
Don't get me wrong, I have been here before and we do enjoy their dumplings, but for some reason the noodles do not impress...and we always order noodles..
Hope to be back for more dumplings and maybe we will try some of the spicy dishes!

He raved about how wonderful Metro Brasserie was and knowing him and his tastes, he usually isn't too far off the mark. So when I had the opportunity to pick a place for my girlfriends and I to meet, I thought what a perfect place to check out. Metro Brasserie is located in Old Town Scottsdale near the chic Waterfront.  The Waterfront is surrounded by trendy boutiques, cafes and wine bars and it's a bustle with Phoenician hipsters and tourists alike. We were all really excited to try this hip new place and feeling our stomachs grumble couldn't wait to indulge our taste buds in yummy delights. It was a little bit busy, after all it was a sunny Sunday afternoon, during the busiest time of the day. We were told the wait would be around 40 minutes for the patio and 20 minutes for interior sitting. Without hesitation we decided interior seating would be best...did I mention we were all really hungry? Within 15 minutes the hostess seated us. The restaurant was super cute and reminded me of some of the little french cafes at home, back in Canada. Thoughts of Pomme Frites, Poutine and Croque Monsieur danced through my head.

The menu had a pretty nice variety of entrees on it and you could order either breakfast or lunch. I really like when restaurants give you options. By the way, who doesn't like a good breakfast?? That's a whole other conversation. Anyway, back to Metro Brasserie - the waiter came to take our order, my friend couldn't decide between the French Toast and the Quiche. Who better to ask then the waiter! My friend proceeds to tell the waiter she's torn between two items.""French Toast or Quiche? Which is better?"" Seemed like a pretty normal kind of question for a waiter. His response blew us away. ""Well, they're really different. One is sweet and the other savory."" The table is silent and I'm sure we're all thinking the exact same thing...no shit! It was at that moment our excitement was replaced with disappointment and a hint of irritation. Not only was the waiters personality drier than toast but let's just say he was seriously lacking character and manners. We all put in our orders; a Burger for me, Belgian Endive Salad with chicken for my friend and the Mushroom Brie Quiche for my other girlfriend. 

An hour and twenty five minutes went by and no food. Our waiter didn't stop by during that time at all - you think he would have advised us of a problem in the kitchen or even just apologized for the delay. Nothing! Our food finally arrives and we begin to devour what seems like a precious jem. The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare with Gruyere and the Pomme Frites and mayo were amazing. The Quiche on the other hand was just okay, ""nothing special"" and the Belgian Endive Salad with chicken was not the best. Apparently, the Salad was also nothing special and had a strange flavored dressing on it that was clearly not enjoyable. We finish eating and chatting and decide to call it day. Mr. poo poo waiter hadn't been by to check on us and after having had waited so long for a mediocre lunch we weren't terribly happy.
  
The service was blatantly awful, the waiter was rude, and only one dish was really good...what to do? Being the somewhat decent consumer, we decide to leave a 10% tip. Anything less would be pretty rude considering most of the food industry lives off the tips. I could not bring myself to leave this fine establishment without saying something, I wrote a little note on the receipt that said ""This is the worst service I've ever experienced!"" I really felt compelled to say something about our experience. We're in the middle of a recession and eating out is a privilege that should be enjoyed. So, shouldn't patrons be treated well when spending money in establishments?",2009-03-02 19:00:41

The atmosphere was low key and dull in my opinion.  We dined there on a weekday so the restaurant appeared to be lighter than normal.

So we begin with the complimentary Duck Fat Fries:  A nice and unique way to start the meal.  There is a trio of different fries, all seasoned differently.  The fries are accompanied with three different dipping sauces.  I would take this over a bread basket any day.

I ordered the Diver Scallops, while my guests had the Wagyu Rib Cap and the Chicken Friend Veal.  My scallops were nothing to write about.  I've had better and the portion was small to my liking.  The other entrees on the other hand were delicious and filling.  We also ordered the Mashed Potato Trio which was very good and great match for our entrees.  The trio consisted of pureed wasabi, lobster, and sour cream / chives.  All delicious.

The service was perhaps the highlight of the meal.  Our waiter and busser were very nice and attentive.  They were never hesitant to cater to our asks.

Our software development team comes here often. Service at this establishment as of late has been bad.

It was Tuesday, meaning that you can get wings for half price. I ordered two pounds of wings. I chose honey garlic and sweet chili as my sauces. It came with fries. I also ordered a Diet Pepsi. I ate half my wings and packed the rest home when I finally got my order.

I placed my order at around noon. Our server was jotting down everyone's names. I thought that things were getting better service-wise. Nope. So wrong.

In our group, I was the last person to get my order. A fellow colleague came in later than I did (12:35 pm) and got her food first before everyone else!

I was the last person to get my food, waiting for over an hour. I thought that I was going to die. Luckily, I have enough fat stored around my belly that I snapped out of hangry mode! 

As soon as I heard my Brazilian developer say that his wings weren't what he had ordered, I knew that he was munching on my lunch order. Yep, she, my server, had given him my order. Ugh!

I finally got my order. My software development manager advised me to not give a tip. I rarely don't tip, but I had to. It was just not right.

Hong Kong noodle soup with duck was a decently cooked portion of duck with a brick of egg noodles. The noodles were so over cooked or reheated that they wouldn't come apart and gave up after of few minutes of fighting them.

Fried rice was decent, egg flower soup was decent but I think most people prefer it a bit thicker and not watery.   Sweet and sour pork was good but the dinner combo only has five pieces.

The fig pecan pie with citrus ice cream was good, but since I have the palette of a 5 year-old, I prefer classic sugary pecan pie.

I got an apple pie, which should be the benchmark.  if you can't make an amazing apple pie, you should go into the cupcake business.  The apples were wafer thin and under-cooked, the spice was too strong, too much allspice or clove, over-powering.  Seasoning should be subtle and delicate with nice chunks of soft baked apples simmering a a delicious almost caramelized sauce....something to really blend in with Ice Cream if you go a la mode.  

The most telling sign has to be this.  My two kids ate two bites and left theirs untouched on the counter and a day later I have half the pie left.  Even the crappiest $5 pie from Fry's I pick at until it's long gone within 2-4 hours tops.  Today I brought the leftover to office, those vultures will eat packets of taco bell hot sauce.

You can tell they truly care about all the animals that they treat. 

Yes, the waiting room and wait times can be inconvenient - but I personally would rather wait here to see the great vets than have an appt at a clinic whose vets I didn't think so highly of.  

I think part of it is that if you are there with a sick pet, the anxiety of the situation might make the wait time seem longer than it is. When I brought my cat in for what I though was kidney failure, I was in near hysterics by the time her name was called, because it seemed like hours (it was only 20 minutes). But when I bring my dog in for routine shots or when I picked him up after his neuter, the wait was 45 minutes to an hour and didnt seem as bad.",2012-07-16 05:13:10

Tasty House is our new go to place for Guangzhou style rice rolls in the morning. $4.99 breakfast combo (rice rolls and congee) available before 11:00 am. The restaurant is at capacity at 9:30 am with a 5-10 minutes wait thereafter. 

The congee is a hit or miss. Oddly enough, it is sometimes bland, sometimes flavourful. While I cannot attest to the quality and consistency of the congee, the rice roll is excellent.The plain or dried shrimp rice rolls are a taste of Asian street food heaven. Savory note of the soy sauce and sesame sauce, sweetness of the hoisin sauce, acidity and heat of the hot sauce, slight bitterness of the toasted sesame, create a umami paradise. Enjoy plain rice rolls with all the aforementioned fixings for $1.99! 

On a side note, I would caution you against ordering any rice roll with protein or vegetables. I have made the mistake once and questioned whether the white ""round thing"" with strange texture was really chicken and whether the brown vegetable was indeed lettuces. Avoid U.F.O.

The service was top notch, our waitress knew everything on the menu...scratch that as there were no physical menus.  Just two black boards on the walls, one in English and the other in French.  Because the English board was further away, she just started translating the French one for us, describing in great detail the ingredients of all the dishes and how they were prepared all of the top of her head.  I was impressed by her knowledge and passion for the things she described.  Since we had a group of 6, she altered the menu so everyone would have a decent bite of every dish ordered.  

Lobster Poutine - great! good chunks of lobster, but quite pricey at $19 for regular size and $28 for a large.
Oysters - were fresh and tasty.  we had a mix of 6 different ones in season that I can't recall anymore.
Braised Short Rib - nothing memorable if that says anything about it

Stopped by at about 12:30 and the parking lot was full.  This place is a in a tiny little run down building.  I loved the sign on the door that said ""to open push hard.""  We are not in summerlin anymore...

So after pushing hard on the door to get in - the place was packed!  One table left, now I can see why the guy that pulled in behind us practically ran us over to get in here first!  He wanted to get a table!

It is a tiny square dining room, with maybe 30 people in  it.  There is no atmosphere here - and with out the advice from Yelpers I would probably not stop in.  Sometimes I can't tell if the restaurant is a quaint mom and pop joint with some charm or if the owners are too cheap to update the place???

The food was about average.  Shredded beef enchilada and a chili rellano.  The only thing that stood out was the sauce - everything else was ok.

A friend had a beef burrito with green chili as a combo.  The burrito was sorta small with a dash of green chili sauce.  Disappointing for a $13 lunch special.

I saw a taco on the plate of another customer and it was a store bought taco bell like taco shell.  Not impressed.

I actually preferred coming here over Pho Kim Long even though Pho Kim Long was voted ""Best Vietnamese Restaurant"" in Las Vegas.

On our most recent trip to Vegas, we stopped in here with a large group of friends.  For the most part, we were all happy with our orders.  The food was average to above average tasting.  Nothing great.

Although, the food came out fairly fast, the service was not so good.  None of the workers seemed to know how to smile either.

My wife and I were starving so we ordered #15, #72, and #96.  We ordered way too much food because the portions were huge.  If I were rating them on just portion size, they would get 5 stars.   #72 was grilled pork, grilled shrimp, eggroll, and vermicelli.  It came packed with food in a large bowl.  With regards to taste, I'd give it 3 stars cause it was just mediocre.  #96 was chinese broccoli and it was 3.5 stars good.  #15 was my wife's pho order.  She really liked the taste of it and rated it 4 stars.  It was way tastier than Pho Kim Long.

39fOWNfy_EcqHI5o8MZxHA,vWLHqiJu5Z2tRghSH8ammw,GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA,4,1,1,2,"From the outside, Mixteca looks like just about any other fast food Mexican joint in the Valley. Located in a somewhat run-down shopping center (Kmart is the anchor store. Yes, Kmart) on the corner of Bell and 67th Ave, Mixteca is a stand-alone restaurant with a drive -through lane that wraps around much of the building. 

I was getting some work done on my car this morning at the nearby Jiffy Lube, and while walking around I saw their marquee sign, saying that they opened at 6:30am. I had some time to kill, so I went in.

Once on the inside, you can see right away that Mixteca is not like just another run-of-the-mill fast food place. The decor is sort of a ""Baja Beach"" theme with a big thatched-roof shack in the middle. It feels just little more refined - they did a nice job with the interior and I was admittedly impressed. There is a bar (yes, a bar. with beer and television sets) in one corner and outdoor dining for when the weather cooperates.

As far as the food goes, they have all the standard offerings. It was morning, so I opted for a ham breakfast burrito. Nice chunks of ham, potato and cheese rolled in a huge flour tortilla. If I had any complaint, it would have been that the potato wedges were a bit too big. On some bites, all I tasted was potato. IMHO, the perfect potatoes for breakfast burritos are of the shredded hash brown variety. Diced potatoes are ok. (At one place in San Diego, their potatoes were french fries. No, I didn't order a California burrito. But I digress....) These chunks were too big. In their defense, I did order the burrito without eggs (who does that??) so perhaps they were just trying to make up for the lack of huevos by overstuffing it with papas. Oh well. I still ate the whole thing. 

Oh, I have to mention - they have a great salsa bar with different types of salsas (and free chips!!) carrots, cucumbers, and onions. Great stuff.

All in all, I was impressed with Mixteca. I look forward to seeing what their lunch and dinner offerings are like!

Enjoy!!",2015-12-05 23:30:47

(2) Baby Octopus Salad - This dish is just yummy. Healthy strips of baby octopus with sesame seeds and not sure what else but I scarf it down.

(5) They always have specials. I love a place that offers stuff off the menu. It shows they care and are trying to be inventive.

I'm not sure why there are bad reviews but they were all from a while back so maybe things have improved.

Do NOT try the wasabi taco. It is soooooo Gross. And apparently week day service is absolute shit. To add to that, the only reason why we got a table so quickly is because the couple got up and left since they hadn't been serviced yet. Did I mention it took my boyfriend 25 minutes to get his credit card back.

I rarely give high reviews. But I really like this place. My boyfriend and I come here all the time, at least 3 times a month. This place is really well priced for what they have. 

$23-25 all you can eat sushi, including drinks, appetizers and desserts. 

As far as the quality of the sushi, it's not fantastic but pretty good. 

The only downside I would have to say is, don't experiment too much. I love trying different things but usually end up regretting most of my choices. The appetizer, ""the shit"" is probably the best experimental item on the menu.

You may have to wave down the server a few times to order unless you sit at the bar, you only have to wave them down for non roll items",2017-09-21 04:37:44

We accidentally stumbled onto CBP when we were going to a different place in the area.  My hubby was set on the other place but when we saw the big lunch special sign out front, we had to investigate.  I mean ANY PIZZA for $6.95 would get anyone's attention I think (this special is Monday-Friday 11am-3pm.)  When I went in to grab a menu to check out, I was sold on pizza for lunch just from the smell of the place!  There was no eating a boring sandwich after smelling the delicious pizzas baking in the oven.

I really liked the whole idea of this place as well.  It was like going to Subway where you walk down the line and point to the items you want on your pizza.  The choices are quite numerous and plentiful.  The toppings all looked super fresh and colorful.  There were several options for crusts, sauces, cheeses, veggies, and proteins.  There must be at least 1000 combos you can make, if not more.  They also have already designed pizzas, if the toppings are too overwhelming for you.  Since we were there for the lunch special time, we could actually get unlimited toppings, if we had chosen to do so.  Instead we went with a classic pepperoni pizza and a white pizza with extra mushrooms because everything is better with mushrooms!  Both were super tasty and had so much flavor.  The thin crust was crisp with a great crunch.  The cheese was ooey gooey and browned just perfectly.  The pepperoni was spicy and delish!

The best thing was our pizzas were prepared, cooked, and boxed up in 5 minutes flat.    That is some awesome pizza service right there.  We very much enjoyed the pizzas and had nothing left over afterwards because we are pizza piggies.  

I would give this place a solid 4 stars but the staff here totally pushes them to a 5 star rating.  Maurice was working the counter when I arrived.  He could tell I was new and slightly confused, especially since I was at the wrong end of the counter trying to order, so he took me under his wing and showed me the light.  He walked me through everything and was describing each step with the greatest of detail.  He spoke about the pizza as if it was his first born child!  His descriptions made you want the pizza right that second.   He totally made the experience amazing.  Both of our pizzas were works of art created by the one and only Maurice the Pizzaman!  Maurice alone makes CBP a 5 star joint!  Go Maurice!!!",2013-09-04 18:59:33

We love how it feels uncrowded, with not much waiting for slides. The staff is friendly and helpful. The grounds are spotless (bathrooms need a little more upkeep, though). Only one slide was not working when we were there. 

I like how they have lots of levels of play. Small splash pools for little ones, and everything from tiny slides to fully enclosed twisty ones. Some slides require a tube, which is readily supplied by the ride. You can rent a raft for just $5, and you get $1 back when you return it. The raft is for wave pool.

We love the free parking, and you can always print a coupon from their website.

We finally had lunch there and have to say, it's really not good. The chili on the chili cheese fries is terrible, although you do get a large portion.

I originally reviewed their Indian School spot and gave them a solid three stars due to having respectable but somewhat pricey foods, with lots of hits and misses with their menu. And honestly, in terms of the overall experience, I'd say that this location is more or less the same. The restaurant itself has a cool setup and unlike the spot on Indian School, also features an outdoor patio. 

We started with a half-order of their fig bruschetta, which includes fig jam, prosciutto, asparagus, and a bit of goat cheese. This item has always been consistently good, while their polpetinne (fried risotto balls) were fine as well.

We've experimented with their menu before by trying their bolognese and being disappointed. I assume their chicken marsala is still very good, while I'd imagine that their poutine (gravy fries) also delivers. We decided to skip these options, however, and just get a diavolo pizza.

Nook's pizza is a bit weird. Ingredients are fine and crust has always had solid flavor, but their pizzas are always served incredibly dry and floury, in stark contrast to what we're used to at most places. I guess it's more of a subjective thing, but I never find myself to be impressed as much as I wish I could be.

For dessert, their options are a bit different than what we remembered. We decided to order their buttercake, which seemed more like a cheesecake than anything else. The dish heavily incorporates graham crackers, including a ganache and an actual miniature graham cracker itself. The dessert was good, but if you're familiar with buttercake, you might be a little thrown off.

Our server was incredibly slow - and I mean painfully slow in comparison to the usual quick service we receive at Nook. The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, so I'm not sure what that was about.

Prices are a bit high, which I've never felt are fully justified. Overall, I'd still recommend Nook as a place to try out. Although the food isn't quite as impressive as I think it could potentially be, it definitely has its fair share of fans.",2017-10-02 14:20:58

Located in an inconspicuous plaza that can be easily overlooked is one of the most expensive Japanese establishments around. Came here for my birthday to try the Sushi Kaiseki ($135 per person) which consists of 8 courses and I was not disappointed. 

Tamago Tofu (Egg Tofu with Lobster) - A cold dish to kick off the meal and cleanse the palate. The tofu was soft and creamy giving an interesting contrast to the texture of the bamboo shoot. The lobster tempura was meaty and worked really well with the sauce. Great start.

Zensai (Assorted Appetizers) - Lots of variety with this one. I cant remember the specifics of each item but I enjoyed every one. The mini octopus with sesame paste, the jello with shrimp, enoki mushrooms, squid etc. inside and the rare duck breast were a wonderful, welcomed challenge to my taste buds. The veggies and mushroom were solid as well. 

Hotate & Nyumen - This was the least memorable dish both in presentation and delicacy. The broth was absolutely delicious but the noodles were just regular well-made thin noodles and the scallop tempura was no longer crispy by the time it was served (is this normal?). A little underwhelming.

Sashimi Moriawase (Chef's Special Choice Sashimi) - Sashimi is phenomenal. The fish is SO fresh, it's insane. I couldn't get over how pure it tasted. I have to admit the quality surpasses that of Yasu. My favorite was the amberjack and I was glad that the uni didn't have an ocean smell to it. This was bomb. 

Gindara Yuan Yaki (Grilled Black Cod, marinated with Yuzu & Sake) - I'm drooling thinking about the cod. Absolute perfection. It came with a myrica rubra/yamimomo fruit that complemented the rest of the dish so well, it blew my mind. The fruit was sweet and such a delight. This can be ordered a la carte and I would highly recommend it! 

Wagyu Shabu Shabu (A4 Wagyu) - I was looking forward to this the most. The beef was so tender, dissolving in my mouth (as it should). The wagyu may not have been top of the line but the quality and marbling was superb nonetheless. I savored every moment of it! It is served with some veggies but they were so thinly sliced that when you dip it into the broth, it shrivels up to become more miniscule and hard to taste. I didn't really care and was too occupied with the beef anyway! 

Omakase Sushi (Chef's Special Choice Sushi) - I had to take a half star off because I felt the nigiri was a little disappointing. The fish was amazing but the sushi rice kept breaking which is something that shouldn't be happening for a place of this calibre. It's unacceptable, really. There were also a few pieces where the wasabi was way too strong. This overpowered the taste of the fish and really took away my enjoyment of eating it. 

Toro Handroll - Best handroll ever although it didn't look too appetizing. The seaweed was so crispy and we were told to eat it as soon as possible to get the full taste. Outstanding. I came to realize handrolls in a cylindrical shape taste better than the typical cone-shaped ones (the prettier version) because the fish to rice ratio is more even this way. I was able to taste the fish in every bite.  

Homemade Dessert - Black seasame icecream with a traditional Japanese biscuit, strawberry red bean mochi and a macaron-like dessert with red bean and green tea ice cream filling, served with brown sugar on the side. I loved every single one. The matcha icecream was an emerald green and strong in flavor just how I like it. Yum.

I was stuffed by the end of the meal. Service was pleasant. Their English isn't the greatest so I had to really listen to their explanations of each dish. Very attentive and friendly overall. 

I personally wouldn't do omakase here (I prefer Yasu for the intimate experience and the reasonable pricing in comparison) but a la carte or the kaiseki is worth a try.

Lots of perfectly mouth-watering beef, crisp lovely veg and a quantity so pleasingly hearty I have noodle soup calling my name from the fridge as we speak. My dinner dates were all delighted as well, including the vegan who was able to swap the chicken broth for all veg (though her soup could have had more veg in it, actually. Load up our animal-loving friends when you can restauranteurs, they are hungry!) We tried 7 different salads, each at about $1.50 a pop, and they were all tasty - the cucumber, radish and potato salads were the table favourites. 

All this good eating, plus a beer, and we walked out each paying under $20 including tax and tip. Super homerun win of a way to ring in 2013.",2013-01-02 17:20:37

I generally like, but do not love Hawaiian and Korean restaurants I have tried, and after eating my Combo Plate with Brown rice, I can say the same for Island Style.

One thing I must say is that getting take out probably diminishes some of the experience and I can easily see it being bumped up to 4 stars with some boiled peanuts and some extra banchan than what was provided with takeout (kimchi only, which was delicious).   Service was top notch for my takeout.   It was packed inside and I was probably a little early and Russell and.... Gina(?) were extremely friendly and did their best to get me my food quickly.   Russell even generously gave me a bottle of water while I was standing there waiting, which was much, much appreciated after the short walk from my car through the flames of hell that was this afternoon's sunshine to the entrance.   He also asked if I wanted hot sauce and I was provided a small container of Sriracha, which is never a bad thing

Opening my takeout container back at the office, I was impressed at the sheer amount of food.   A healthy portion of BBQ Chicken, Ribs, and Meat Jun awaited me.   I liked all three, but didn't love any single one of them at the same time.  

My overall impression was it was a very satisfying meal, but I think for my next visit I'd like to actually sit and eat, take in some of the boiled peanuts and banchan, and maybe try a dish that doesnt translate well to takeout like the Stone Pot Bibimbap (even though I have no idea what the hell it is)",2012-08-16 04:55:48

- I love that their Butcher counter is from Pavao meats, which I previously reviewed and really enjoy going to

Cons:
- Their seafood counter is a little bit abysmal

- Their fruit and vegetable selection never seems to be enough, you walk round and round and you put nothing in your basket
- Their entrances are like teeny tiny, the one from the above ground parking lot and the one from the mall

So back to this butcher shop which I'd say is the only saving grace of this place. They serve great meats, reasonable prices and this time I got to try some more tasty sausages that are fantastic, one of the big reasons I go to the real shop on Dundas.

Let me preface by saying that we didn't have plans to actually go all the way to the top today.  We just headed to Sandstone Quarry to get some cardio done.  The three choices we had were Calico Tanks, Turtlehead Peak, and Grand Circle trails.  Since my partner in crime and I have already done Calico Tanks before and Grand Circle was way too long (11.4 miles round trip) we headed out on Turtlehead Peak trail with plans to see how far we could get in the time we had.  This hike is rated as difficult and I would concur.  My son does this hike all the time by himself and he's always been reluctant to take us with him because we would just slow him down.  After doing this, I would agree with him.  We weren't super slow, but we weren't fast, either.  You are basically climbing the whole way to the peak.  Some spots are easier than others, but the closer you get to the peak, the higher the inclines and the uneasier I felt.  Why?  Well, there are spots that are just gravel and combine that with steep inclines and narrow pathways means that it's easy to lose your footing and slip.  Thankfully none of that happened today, but I did fall on my behind once but I was bracing myself on a big tree branch when it happened: no blood, no foul.  

Mel C. was wearing his Garmin so we knew that it took us 80 minutes to make it to the peak from the parking lot.  That was 80 minutes of moving time; he would stop his watch when we were taking breaks, which happened a few times so we could catch our breaths and/or hydrate.  I recommend bringing layers of clothing, hydration, snacks, and gloves if you are going to attempt this hike during the winter.  We encountered snow at the top, too.  Luckily, there was another hiker that we were following to the top and we followed his footsteps when we got to the snowy part because the trail kind of got buried underneath the snow.  The signage on the trail is fairly good and easy to follow, but there's nothing when you get to the actual peak so look out for the trail that has a border with rocks on the left side of you as you keep ascending.  The views are spectacular and we reveled in our accomplishment because we didn't think we'd actually make it today. 
 
This is not an easy hike and I would caution those who want to do it to take your time, watch your footing, and bring the right supplies.  Going down the mountain is not simple, either.  Again, it's easy to slip on the gravel as you descend.  Even just getting your foot stuck on a crag can lead to a head-first tumble so be safe, but have fun.  We did it and our calves and knees can attest to it!",2017-01-15 02:06:58

We'd had some pretty poor experiences with other veterinarian offices (and veterinarians in general) over the years, and were looking for someone who at least knew what they were doing.

Arrow Animal Hospital has more than exceeded every expectation we could ever hope for in a vet office.  Their entire staff is knowledgeable, professional, friendly, caring, compassionate, responsive and genuinely care about and love the pets.  They are not just going through the motions, they live it day in and day out and have ALWAYS gone the extra mile to make sure our pets' needs (and ours) are met.  The doctors-led by Dr. Sherrell and Dr. Prater-are top notch and extremely competent and tell you what needs to be done as well as exploring all options.  I have never been pressured into making a decision on something, something I have experience at other vet offices.  I've been to a few who have honestly tried to ""up-sell"" services, and I've felt like I'm at a used car lot.  Not at Arrow.  Vet care, or course, can be expensive, just as human are can be, but Arrow is very reasonable.  And the best part?  They will work with you!!  They take Care  Credit, and also offer in-house payment plans, so if your pet needs an expensive procedure, it won't bankrupt you and you can actually get it done without worrying how it's getting paid for.  They honestly care about your pet's welfare!  I can't say enough good things about these guys, and if you're looking for a veterinarian office who are in it for all the right reasons and genuinely care about our furry family members, then these are the guys you want!

Fast Forward a few days: Our 12  1/2 year old Golden mix, Roxy, was having trouble breathing and turned blue on the way to the vet office after they told us to bring her in immediately.  It was determined that she had paralysis of the nerves in her larynx, a life-threatening condition common to her breed and needed surgery as quickly as possible.  We contacted a specialist in Glendale, and they would do the procedure but short of taking out a loan, there was no way we could have afforded the care within a day or two and they would not accept payments or work with us.  I spoke to Dr. Sherrell, he's the only doc at Arrow who does the procedure and he agreed to do it without hesitation.  We had it done a few days later, for less than half of what the specialty hospital charged, we have a year to pay it off, and my old girl is doing great!!  Dr. Sherrell and his staff at Arrow saved Roxy's life.  They even managed to clean her teeth while she was under .  I can't speak highly enough about Arrow Animal Hospital.  I wish I could remember everyone's name, but there were so many people and it was a stressful week, but much thanks to Dr. Sherrell, Dr. Payton, Dr. Lindstadt, Beth, Whitney, April, Brenda and all those whose names I don't remember who helped take care of Roxy, and who have taken care of my other animals over the years.",2015-07-17 02:08:15

Non yelping friends have been talking about this place for months so we decided to join them on a Wednesday night for some Philly cheese steaks.  JVG is located inside of the MR G's bar and grill on the corner of Sandhill and Desert Inn. Mr G's is an old school dark divey hole in the wall type of setting with a grill operated by JVG. Upon arriving and seating in a very uncomfortable booth we were quickly greeted by John whom we told we were waiting for two more to arrive.  After sitting for a few minutes we realized that you had to venture to the bar to buy your drinks.  So we opted for the $8 pitcher of Bud Light.  Once our friends arrived John realized they were regulars and greeted them by name.  He advised that the menu was out dated and they no longer had a few of the items. We ordered all the fried goodies and cheese steaks and ate away.  The food was great and the service by John was top notch.  I can't wait to try a JVG burger and the Italian sub on our future visits as we have added this place to our list of Fav's.
 If you have a problem with smoke Do not complain as this place allows smoking in the bar and while we have no problem with it I am sure you will read in the reviews people complain about it.  They have a couple pool tables we might take advantage of next time for some added fun with our fantastic food.  They seem to do a heavy take out and delivery, so, give it a try.  John told us that they are opening a new location inside the Cue Club In the Commercial center at Sahara an Maryland in the next month or so.

Also true, it is poorly designed so that it's disorienting to navigate. True again, it is full of kids. And even though it's just a mall, it's a great example of one.

On the surface it doesn't seem so special, but when you investigate further, you'll notice that the stores here seem to carry more ""stuff"" than the same stores at other malls around the valley. They'll still carry stuff that would normally head to outlet stores for awhile, and they carry the obscure online-only items you won't find elsewhere. 

Perhaps this isn't the case for every store, but if you're a mall shopper - you should check this place out to see what I'm talking about. Compare Nordstroms and Buckle and even A&F here to the one at your local mall. I know none of these stores are compelling enough reasons to go out of your way, but I don't like to have to go to these stores very often so when I do go I want to make the most of it.

The theater attached here is pretty nice and there are one or two fairly unique stores, but otherwise this is a very standard example of a mall - a good example, but also nothing too special. I wouldn't suggest braving it on a weekend, but during the week should prove to be a fruitful shopping day.  3.5/5",2008-04-29 06:50:20

Honestly, I pretty much stick to the ""nutritional shakes"" which are just a base (I always go through w/non-fat yogurt) and a flavor (I mix it up amongst the different fruits they have). One time I did ask the guy helping me about some of the the shakes  that added boosts/supplements and how I might benefit (or have a negative reaction) to those things while going through chemo. He was helpful (although I'm sticking to the nutritional shakes from here on out since my taste buds seem to like the basic yogurt/fruit combo with nothing else). I also think it's nice that you have a variety of bases to choose from w/your shake (soy, almond milk, yogurt, etc...).

I don't take advantage of the rest of the store, but it looks like they have a large variety of supplements, vitamins, etc. This area doesn't have any other place like this close by so it's nice that there's a store that sells these products in the area. They also have tanning beds. Not sure how the pricing is compared to other places (it's been years since I've fake & baked), but it's nice that you can your tan & nutritional needs all in one location.

The beef morsels were also tender and went deliciously with the medley of veggies.

Both my friend and I finished our sandwiches and were satisfied.
Recently, I made another visit with my hubs this time since I wanted to take him to place he has not been to but also close to home. He opted for the karage sandwich with a side- beef stew. I got the karage bites since I wanted something to munch on and we shared the beef stew. The star of the show imo was the beef stew! I thought I was getting a dark brown maybe extremely salty stew but it was completely opposite! It looked like chicken noodle soup but of course more thick and with beef. It was so delicious..Man I wish I got the full size!! The staff actually recommended either the beef stew or chili and I am so glad I tried the stew or I was going to get my usual chicken noodle soup lol!

One thing about my most recent visit was the service, we were asked if we liked the meal and we were served water once we took our seats. The food was served at our table even though Just Braise is like a fast food set up where you order, and get your food yourself.

I am exercising regularly since the high school, and am obviously picky about the gyms. Everything is important for me - professional level of the trainers, quality of the classes, equipment, facilities...

Totum has never disappointed me in more than two years. The place is clean and cared about, with excellent ""machinery"" inside. Staff knows me and my wife by name, they are cheerful, positive and fun people.

Professional level of ""my"" chiropractor (Rachel Assayag) and personal trainer (Andrew Steinfeld) is exceptional, and boxing classes by Antonio Lopez are always super-fun - can only recommend them wholeheartedly!

Important point: Not only those guys are great people, they are also a certified professionals - which is not a common trend across the gyms in Ontario. And this is another great value of Totum - people who work with your body here, really know what they are doing.

Another important thing: Totum is an actual ""sportsman's gym"", not just one of those threadmill-packed ""social clubs"". No doubt they have all the threadmills you may need, but the classes, sport medicine services and personal training at Totum are a pro-level thing. As such, Totum is not cheap by any means, but every dollar I spend there is worth it.

So if you are serious about being fit, Totum is probably THE only first-class choice here in Toronto. At least I have not seen anything getting even close to it. Good job guys - keep it running! :-)",2011-02-14 19:47:13

Then got a Guinea Pie.  A new chef, I hear.  The pizza was a little under-done (which means it didn't have that crisp, caramelized crust) -- that's why only 4 stars.  I'll look forward to a return on my next trip.  Still, great food.",2017-01-02 19:18:19

We came into this place with a reservation when we arrived in Vegas in September and right off the bat were not greeted at all. We should have known from there the experience would be bad. 

We sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. We ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs. 
The pizza was SO GREASY that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. When we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

The meatball was just ok. Nothing to write home about. 

When our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. She then said in a very rude tone that ""That is how it is and that is normal for ALL pizza"". I was offended with that remark. She has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks THAT was normal. 

Any who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude.

They have all the things that regular grocery stores have such as a produce section, fresh meats, frozen foods, refrigerated foods, shelf stable items and a bakery.  They also have a prepared food section and a dining area where you can eat.

The place is not as clean as T&T, but is by no means dirty, and the staff are nice enough.

If you go at the end of the day they mark down a lot of their prepared foods and bakery items.  They had sushi rolls (i.e. California rolls, Shrimp tempura rolls, etc.) for as little as $2.99.  Plates of General Tao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork were $4.99.  Buns from their bakery were 6 for $3.99.

We were promptly and happily greeted by staff upon entering. It must've been obvious it was our first time (I'm sure the long pondering period and questioning glances to each other had something to do with it) and we were graciously extended help with choosing what to order which was appreciated.
 I went with the ""Complicated Order"" and my boyfriend chose the ""Guac and Mole."" We also ordered a 16oz cantaloupe/chia seed juice and a Ghirardelli mocha. We were brought these beverages first, and immediately we questioned why the cantaloupe juice was a huge 24oz. We didn't order that size. Were we unknowingly charged for that size? Did they run out of 16oz? Who knows. I already paid. And tipped, for that matter. A little too embarrassing to squabble over after the fact. 
Over 10 minutes later our sandwiches were brought to us. Seems like a little long to put two sandwiches together, but maybe that's just me. Even more annoying that once our food was set down and repeated to us, both my boyfriend and our server realized they'd gotten my boyfriend's order wrong. The sandwich was yanked away and we were left to share my own as we were both too ravenous to wait any longer. By the time his sandwich was corrected and brought to us some 10 additional minutes later, he'd already finished the other half of my own. We were given a simple ""Sorry for the wait."" No compensatory anything was given as retribution for putting a damper on lunch. Mind you, $40 later.
Not a good first impression left. What peeves me the most about this entire experience is the fact I tipped these people 20% prior to even receiving our food. Completely undeserved. Nobody's fault but my own, but definitely a learning experience going forward. 
We're no vegans or vegetarians, but we still appreciated the high quality of the food we received. It just wasn't good enough for us to go out of the way coming back here.",2014-10-12 10:37:12

I'm glad I did! There were a few other Chinese restaurants in this plaza as well. Szechwan Palace had an extensive menu (as expected), and I found it amusing that they even had a section in the back explicitly labeled ""Americanized Chinese Food."" xD Definitely order the authentic stuff though!

Unfortunately, my phone was not working so I don't have any photos of my food, but I had an amazing meal of sliced beef tendon appetizer and a fried intestines clay pot dish with bean sprouts. I went through several bowls of rice (also because I was starving), and still had leftovers.

Service was okay, but I also spoke Mandarin. Prices are reasonable, and portions are good. The interior of the restaurant is very nicely decorated, better than I expect for an authentic Chinese place, and there are plenty of seats.

When one hears about the name, one thinks that it will cost one an arm and a leg in order to eat there.  That however is far from it.  The restaurant is quite affordable, very tasty and each plate is filled to the top.

A friend and I went to go visit the place a few weeks ago for afternoon lunch.  I personally have been there many times before but have never had a chance to talk about it.  I especially like their menu because one can get anything from a $5 dollar noodle to $30 dollar lobsters.  Since it was lunch I decided to go with something lighter and went with their Pork Chop in Onion Sauce ($7.49) while my friend went with the Parmesan Pork Neck ($8.99).  Both items were located on their one page laminated lunch menu.

Both meals took about 15 minutes to arrive and both of them arrived at the same time.  The plates were blazing hot as were both meals.  My meal was rather large in the sense that I was given two large pieces of pork chops, a good spoonful of corn and roughly about a bowl and a half of rice.  There was a large quantity of onion sauce as well that covered the entire plate of food.  The pork chops were nicely cooked and seasoned with black pepper.  The meat itself was not lean but not overly fat either.  Overall the meal was absolutely what I wanted and with a dollar more, I had a nice cold ice tea to go with my meal.

I really don't have any complaints about this place.  Every time I go there, there is a table ready for me.  The place is pretty big and has about thirty tables or so to accommodate all their guests.  There was plenty of staff on hand and they know how to treat their customers right.  Their food comes out fast so that we're not left sitting there for long periods wondering if our food will ever arrive.  Completely satisfy with everything.",2017-01-28 16:10:41

The jambalaya had lots of flavour and you could identify the different proteins like the catfish, shrimp, and italian sausage.  It was almost a little too soft and mushy for my preferences because it also felt like the consistency of microwave instant oatmeal but that didn't take away from the bursts of flavour in the dish.

I mainly come here for the prepared foods.  There's a very large selection.  I love the pancakes including mushroom, shrimp and the ones made with pollock.  But, avoid the Korean style meatballs!  They say they are made with beef but they don't taste right.  The Korean BBQ in a cup is a good value.  Too bad about the cold clump of rice at the bottom of the cup which is hard, dry and tasteless even when warmed.

When entering, it is difficult to get past the check out area with the large grocery cart provided. If there's a designated entrance that avoids this busy area, I haven't found it.

We actually got lost coming here because you needed to turn a small hidden corner going down King and it was very easy to miss. In fact, we went into the condo right beside the restaurant by accident.. oops!

However, once you stumble into Patria, you'll find that the ambiance is beautiful.  The interior is filled with vintage paintings and a soft candle-lit dimness that permeates the restaurant.  

Our waiter was extremely friendly with armfuls of tattoos and piercings, there was also a bearded server who looked pretty cool :P  Would've loved to make some interesting convos with the staff there, they all looked like quite the characters.  Anyways, our waiter was a total sweetheart and helped us pick the dishes to try - since the only thing I knew to order was the paella.. which he also helped pick.  :3

Onto the amazing food!
1) Pimientos Rellenos De Buey
Piquillo Peppers + Oxtail + Manchego ($14)
This came in a set of two.  The piquillo pepper was completely cooked and its soft interior wrapped around the tender oxtail.  Our server suggested that we order bread to go with this dish so that we could taste the sauce better, mhm.  Very appetizing start to our meal :) 

2)DÃ¡tiles Con Tocino IbÃ©rico
Dates + IbÃ©rico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas ($9)
I absolutely LOVED this small plate.  Who knew bacon and dates go together so well?  The sweetness of the dates was balanced perfectly by the salty bacon flavour.  I barely tasted the manchego but I think this dish was culinary genius :3  I'd eat 20 of these each day if I can.............. 

3)Paella De Bogavante Y Gambas
Lobster + Gulf Shrimp + Chorizo + Peas ($55)
This came in a fairly large pot which was shared between two people.  I loved the chorizo the most in this dish - I think I might've picked 80% of it hehe.  Lobster and shrimp were fresh but I actually didn't find them to be too special. However, the white rice was cooked deliciously - perfectly moist and perfectly seasoned... I think there was saffron too.  I like the rice more than the seafood!  

4) Churros Con Dulce De Leche
Spanish Doughnuts + Cinnamon Sugar + Dulce de Leches ($6)
I REALLY enjoyed the cinnamon sugar-coated churros, but the chocolatey-caramel (dulce de leches?) was a bit off for me.  The sweetness was tainted by a saltiness I can't pinpoint - which didn't go well with the cinnamon sugar.  However, still a great dessert that melted my sweet tooth *_*

It took about 3 weeks to get an appointment with this office. On the day of my appt, I came early to fill out my new patient paperwork, but like the other reviews have stated, this office tends to run an hour behind on schedule. The waiting room is very small, maybe a dozen seats, but it is a nice looking office. It's not so easy to find though. 
      Once I was in the the room, it did take at least another 15 minutes to get started on my X-rays and exam. The dental assistant was very nice to me and so was Dr. Um. The dentist recommended the exact work I already knew I needed. I feel like some dentists make up problems with your teeth to make money, and I did not get this impression from this office at all. They were also able to get ALL of the work I needed done at the same appointment, and allowed my friend to charge $799 on his credit card over the phone for my dental work. They were patient with me for 30 min while I figured out how to pay for the service. 
        This place is fairly affordable for cash paying patients. There is definitely cheaper dentists to go to, such as Cherrington Dental right across the street. This place charged $150 per resin composite filling, and I needed 2 replaced from 10 years ago. This was much cheaper than other dentists I've been to, but Cherrington only charges $99 per filling. I also needed my old Invisalign attachments removed, and I noticed they advertised Invisalign here. They charged me $300 to remove 16 attachments. This is where I have become unsatisfied with the service. I've had these removed before, and my teeth should of felt as silky smooth as the rest of my teeth after being removed. Unfortunately this was not the case. I mentioned it to Dr. Um and he kept drilling at them. One of my fangs feel much smoother but I could tell he was shaving my actual tooth because I could taste it. I've had IPL done before and your teeth being shaved into your mouth is a very memorable taste and smell. This shouldn't happen when removing Invisalign attachments. I personally think the wrong drill was used to remove mine here. It's  been 2 weeks, and those teeth feel gross. There is definitely still composite residue left on them. I'll have to ask my usual dentist to clean it up when I go in for my next cleaning. At least the attachments appear to be gone, so there's that.  I also wonder if this place has a hygienist? Because the dental assistant polished and flossed my teeth for me and I thought that was strange. The dentist did do my cleaning though. I noticed other reviewers have mentioned this as well, so I can't help but wonder if an actual hygienist is on staff here? 
       I would use this place as my alternative dentist. I just wouldn't recommend Invisalign here, I would go to an actual Orthodontist for that.",2018-03-23 23:06:30

Service isn't amazing, but you really shouldn't expect for it to be.

It's a different culture, and it is what it is- deal with it. You'll probably have to wave a server down if you want something, because they won't be doting on you every five minutes. This is usually born from the fact that they have a HELL of a lot going on all at once, so don't take it personal, guailo.

Anyhow... the lunch today really wasn't amazing. It was fine, but I expect better from this place. The egg roll was just plain mushy, and that wasn't cool. The hot and sour soup was airport-restaurant quality. Now, I understand that for the lunch rush they probably just prepare an ass-ton of food in the back, and serve it to order. I get that. However, after my meal today I couldn't in good conscience give another five-star rating.

The Dan Dan noodles were good. The pork short ribs were good. The rice was mushy, but once again I think that it was just a victim of being large-batch cooked for the lunch rush.

the Bad: So the space was a bit on the crowded side and there really not much room to maneuver around. Layout was kind of strange, but it fit the overall space provided by the art museum. Weather was kind of warm, but that's not something that can be controlled, contrary to popular belief. Who brings their kids to events like this? There is a time and place, this was not it. Leave the kids and strollers at home. Pretty weak bad list, I think.

the Neither here nor there: Beer selection was pretty weak, but I feel this was by design since it was a showcase of food and wine. Beer has not quite made the foodie scene in Phoenix. There were some strange selections/choices of food by the restaurants themselves that seemed odd. It's been pretty well documented out in the web, but Federal Pizza not having pizza was strange. There were only a handful of examples of this, so really a minor thing.

the Good: Great selection of restaurants. Amazing selection of wines. The food being put out by all (even the strange choices) was tops. Add to the fact that they were not cooking inside their actual restaurants, but outside, and these wonderful chefs/cooks/helpers deserve a standing ovation.

What's different than other brazilian steak houses I've been to is that they don't give you a coaster to let the attendants know whether you want to take a break. The waitress service with the drinks is extremely slow tho. My boyfriend ordered his beer, and our waitress kept forgetting about it and didn't end up getting his drink until the end of his meal...and they still charged him for his flat beer.

Food on the other hand is spectacular. there's different kinds of meat coming around every 3-4 minutes or so. Be prepared to walk in with stretchy sweat/yoga pants cus you'll be wobbling out so full, you didn't even know your stomach can stretch that far out!

Meats is cooked to perfection. Even their sides don't lack in quality either.. Which is surprising cus novelty places like this where people go for the experience, food isn't normally good but Copacabana's steak is probably one of the best I've had in the GTA.

We ordered the Mushroom Brie Burger and the Mediteranean Salad with Roasted Chicken. The food took thirty minutes. During that time she brought a muffin that went with one of the entrees and dressing.

Our server came by and realized as soon as she saw the salad that it wasn't the right one. She took it and with apologies said she would have it fixed. She came back shortly with the right one.

The food was good. The burger cooked correctly. The salad was delicious with pieces of artichoke, blue cheese and kalamata olives! Tender slices of chicken on top! The muffin was pumpkin with a crumble crust! 

Our server checked back to see how everything tasted. She seemed more relaxed at this point, even chatting with us. The manager came by and also apologized about the salad. He also told us he would take the salad off. We told him that wasn't necessary, but he insisted.

I wouldn't dare compare it to Bellagio, Palazzo, Wynn...or any of those top notch hotels but in comparison to Riviera, Flamingo, Imperial, and those type of establishments...LVH holds up for sure! I've lodged in some of the best and worst hotels in Vegas and I would stay at LVH again solely on the quality that is given for the price. My bf and I paid $40/night (Thursday-Sunday). Can't find that bargain at Imperial which is such a trashy hotel. The rooms at LVH are big, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. The North Tower has all remodeled rooms but of course they are more expensive. 

The hotel itself is not exciting but the Oasis club was poppin' on Friday night. They do have a HUGE sports book, the casino is not that big, and the buffet is a good deal. Checking in was flawless and they were friendly, I never waited more than 30 seconds for the elevators, the parking structure is very close to the hotel. There are tennis courts and the pool is cool. Happy hour every day at the pool from 4p-8p, dj spins, 2 for 1 drinks, and $2 shrimp cocktails...I had a blast lounging at the pool all day. 

Best feature would have to be the monorail...it's INSIDE the hotel next to the Oasis club and is very convenient for getting to the strip. LVH doesn't have much excitement within walking distance so it's cool to ride the monorail. Single ride is $5 or there are unlimited usage passes to buy. Who goes to Vegas to stay in the room all day anyway?...LIVE IT UP!!!

Tip: GO GREEN (opt-out of housekeeping) every day and the hotel gives you $5 for food or $10 for slot play each say you opt-out. Pretty cool...I don't need housekeeping just fresh towels and emptied trash.

I selected a rainbow roll with a side of clear soup and I picked out a salmon bento box for my mother.  While I was waiting, the extremely friendly waitstaff offered me a free pot of green tea. 

The clear soup was very delicious, and not too salty. My rainbow roll was not the best I've ever had, but still fresh and sufficiently tasty. Mom LOVED her bento box, which was a steal for the price. It had salmon, a few California rolls, an egg roll, and vegetables.

We stopped in for lunch today, and made it in a little before the typical lunch rush. I went with their three cheese melt and a cup of their spicy crab soup. It was perfect for a chilly December day in Charlotte. Do not be alarmed by the ""spicy"" in their crab soup, it really is more a subtle heat, and I am one that is a wuss when it comes to spicy foods, and I gobbled it up! It really is a very mild spice that just warms you up right along with the rest of the soup. The chunks of crab in here let you know the soup is the real deal too! Simply delicious!

I opted for the mac and cheese as my main and did not regret it. The noodles were perfectly cooked, drowning in creamy cheesy goodness and topped with crispy butter Ritz crackers.

Which thinking about it, is very odd since I love tacos! Anyway, I had been doing research on new restaurants when I stumbled on this restaurant. What intrigued me the most when reading about Cocina Economica is that it was attempting to take a more simple and authentic approach to Mexican food and staying away from the gimmicks and ""twists."" Rather than add a spin to an already delicious cuisine, they were going to try to keep it real - yeah, having a hard time explaining why I just had to check this place out . :)

On the restaurant's website you can make a reservation but you can't see the menu. The food menu is split into 4 sections:

Bocaditos (appetizers)
Entradas (mains)
Sides
Dulces (desserts)

I had made a reservation for 6 and when we got there on a Friday night, the restaurant was packed! So much so that we were squeezed in a corner and lucky for us, and them, the 6th person cancelled at the last-minute because there was no room to fit a 6th body in the cramped corner we were in. Immediately after sitting down we were served fried tortillas and two salsas - one red, one green and neither was spicy. Soon after our waitress came by to take our order. Some of my friends decided to share appetizers, but I went straight to the main. Our order was:

Tinga tostada $12 (appetizer)
Al Pastor $14 (main)
Pescado en papelado $22 (main)
Barbacoa $18 (main)
Pastel Impossible $9 (dessert)

I ordered the Al Pastor and I LOVED it! It was marinated pork leg served right off the spit and it was served with rice, beans, tortillas and grilled pineapple. I specially loved how I asked for no onions and this request was made possible. I was in heaven. I grew up eating this food, so knowing that a restaurant in Toronto was making food that reminded me of the good moments growing up had me feeling ecstatic!

The rest of the table also enjoyed their meals and the only item that was not well-received was the caldo (soup) that came with the Barbacoa (lamb) - I am personally not a fan because I find it tastes greasy and gamy.

The Hiccups

Several people at our table had ordered Coronas (so cliche I know :)) and as more people arrived they also wanted Coronas and realized that rather than pay for them separately, you could get a bucket and it would be cheaper. So we asked our waitress for the bucket deal. She told us that it was too late because some people had already ordered some individually and the ""system"" could not be changed from singles to the bucket deal. Okay, we found that silly and bizarre. But after some back and forth she agreed to give us the price of the bucket.

Because our table was so small, there was no room to put all the tortillas for each of our mains, so our waitress told us that she was going to bring more out when we were done with the few we had been given - every single one of our dishes came with tortillas, but only got half the amount because of space on the table. We ran out of them pretty quickly and we couldn't find our waitress so we asked another staff for more tortillas and he told us that there would be an extra cost. I told him to please check with our waitress first because she owed us another batch. Then our waitress came over with the 2nd batch and we figured the issue had been addressed. When we got the bill we were charged for the 2nd round of tortillas ($3)! Argh! And they did not take it off the bill! So sad to see a good meal be tarnished by something that could have been very simply taken care of.

In sum, though there were some letdowns the food was delicious enough to warrant a second visit. And who knows, this is a new restaurant and new establishments should be allowed time to iron out their kinks. And let's be honest, they are not lacking business!",2015-07-16 11:28:18

Tractors, tractors, tractors, everywhere. OK, I get it, the farm-to-table concept. Enough, already. Enough!

My first visit to HHGG was WAY-back-in-the-day of its first Vegas locations' soft-opening, West Sahara, at the invitation of an acquaintance of part-owner Jim Nyberg (whom introduced himself while we were there). 

The roof was leaking over our table (hey, it WAS a soft-opening, forgiven), but the portions were huge, so I left impressed. 

I don't remember being run over by any tractors.

Fast forward almost a dozen years, my next visit, this evening. 

The A/C was broken. I get that, things happen. So, going-in, I wrote off off the 7pm empty parking lot to that situation, rather than as a referendum on the venue itself. (The parking lot is a rule I generally use as a deciding factor going-in, but I was curious where HHGG is today). 

On the other hand, the A/C is impacting revenue, so someone should be paying the premium needed to get the HVAC guy on-site after-hours. I caught a break, my booth at the far back had a portable fan running right next to it.

The special was a ten-buck chicken fried steak, veggie, mashed potatoes, biscuit. I fronted it with a $4 side salad. 

The side salad was a shocker. The bowl was the size of a 4""x6"" index card with sides only about 3/4"" of an inch high. Yeah, that china was certainly chosen to make small look full. I just knocked back a tasty side salad (for the same price) at Village Pub the other day that clocked in at about three times the volume. And by that I mean the normal volume for a side salad. 

Penny-pinching on Iceberg lettuce and Roma tomatoes -and get this - ONE cruton. A big one, but one just the same. And it was as tough & chewy as a kitchen sink sponge. Come on management, what is this place facing bankruptcy or something?

The CFS plate was huge, part of the central concept/draw of this chain. The CFS itself was a much-larger-than-average portion, but the presentation is designed to make things look even bigger, as it was draped over a huge pile of potatoes. My guess is that there is about a pound-and-a-half of food on this large oval plate.

Unfortunately, the CFS was a not-so-fun cut/quality of meat, and it clearly had to be heavily tenderized to qualify for serving. The potatoes: just potatoes with some garlic and cheese thrown in to give them some flavor. Overall, pretty bland. But a-whole-lotta bland.

The biscuit represented more cheap carbs contributing to the plate's weigh-in. Over 2 inches tall. Chewy-tasty enough, when drizzled with some butter. Jam would have been nice, I shoulda asked.

The veggie was four -- count 'em four - little string beans, or maybe they were asparagus. They were so puny & shriveled up I wasn't exactly sure. I wolfed 'em, of course, and I still don't remember any actual flavor telling me which they actually were.

After tea & tip, I was in for a twenty. For the ""special."" That being mostly a massive plate of bland mashed potatoes.

Bottom line: Really big, really filling, but not all that scrumptious. Maybe this is why the parking lot is light, after all.

Maybe this approach is your cup-of-tea, or a lot of folks' cup-of-tea. But it doesn't work for me. If I want to top-off-the-tank with low-octane-fuel, I can just hit the low-end casino buffets for seven smackers at lunchtime. 

And there I can fill a whole plate with salad.",2017-06-28 07:47:41

It's fine to have a busy restaurant but if the food is going to take 40-60 minutes longer to get out of the kitchen than normal you tell people before they order. You don't keep them trapped in your restaurant after they have paid for food waiting. I will give it to the kitchen staff, it looks like most of them where fighting nobly to get through orders but you can only do so much when the proper systems are not there to set you up for success. I also appreciated the decaf ice tea! The food was decent but the smug child posing behind the counter as an adult needs to learn how to treat people. Seriously working behind the counter at a casual dining establishment gives you no high ground to look down on people from, it's honest work, I've done it myself but I never forgot that I was in CUSTOMER service. I can't wait to try the location in central, it's soooo close to my house I don't think I will be able to resist trying it!!!!  Also I have to throw a shout out to the twenties something women who pretty much ran around crazy doing everything for everyone, she has a tattoo on her right arm, she knows who she is!!!

I threw my back out last week working in the yard, I know not as exciting as a car accident or street brawl. I waited a week hoping that it would get better but each day the same thing would happen, wake up and it felt fine then after standing for a few minutes the stiffness and soreness would come creeping back. So enough was enough. 

So I decided to search Yelp for a good chiro and stumbled upon Dr. Reiss and Southern Nevada Chiropractic. I was immediately greeted by Ashley (office manager) who was super friendly and outgoing. From there she had me fill out a few forms and within a few minutes was being examined by Dr. Reiss. He has some very cool technology that he uses to diagnose my problem. In no time he got my back straightened out and then armed me with a daily routine of stretches and exercises to help prevent this from happening again. 

If you ever mess your back up and you need a pro who knows what he's doing, give Southern Nevada Chiropractic a call. They take most major insurance but if you don't have insurance their pricing is reasonable. Stay healthy!",2013-02-23 19:46:39

I ordered the Hai-nan chicken. Okay before you guys get all ""wtf is that"" on me, let me just first say that I took a picture of my meal this time so you guys can all see how juicy and awesome this chicken was. The reason I got this today was because it was the Friday special and also because I always wanted to try this chicken. The first time i came here I ordered the lemongrass BBQ chicken and it was worth 5 stars to me, 2nd time was beef, 3rd time was chicken, and 4th time is chicken again! Chicken is definitely my favourite here! (So I guess I have been here 4 times). 

The chicken was so moist it couldn't have been anymore moist. The skin was just like it should be. The side of salted green onion and garlic (it's not supposed to be eaten like coleslaw, it's meant to be put on top of the chicken) was perfectly seasoned and awesome. The rice was heaven. I'm like a rice master (since I always eat rice. Don't be racist). It was perfectly cooker, not mushy, not hard, perfectly seasoned (I think they put lemongrass while steaming the rice) and it was just so aromatic and awesome. I probably could've eaten the rice on its own without the chicken and I would've been a happy man. I can't even imagine how bomb that rice would've been if it was put into fried rice. 

One thing you guys should know about this dish before ordering it is that the chicken is supposed to be cold! It's not supposed to be super hot or sizzling. And no, they didn't forget to heat it up or anything. This is the way that Hai-nan chicken should be eaten. Sometimes it's called hainanese chicken.

The ONLY disappointing thing was that I wish there was more chicken because of how good it was. But I guess I can't complain too much because of how cheap it is also! It's only 9 bucks after a 15% discount given at lunch! 

On top of all this, the servers and waiters and waitresses are all very attentive and nice. The owner there is also very nice. Like I said before, I think his name is ""Kai"". 

OKAY LET ME JUST ADD ONE MORE THING... I took pictures of a smaller menu they recently just added. Let me be the first to say that it looks beyond amazing. Most of these dishes are from mainland China and they have everything from spicy fish in a pot, to pig trotters, to pig ears, to braised pork, EVERYTHING OKAY?!? It's definitely a carnivores delight. I took pictures of this too!!

Let's talk about their menu. It is set up like a build your own, which sounds great in the beginning-- who doesn't like to custom their meal? However as you make your choices, make sure that you are prepared to pay for it since everything is an up charge. Sure, its like a $1 or whatever-- but after you pay $12 for a plate of just okay teriyaki you might not feel like those extra dollars was worth it.

Proteins: chicken teriyaki, chicken teriyaki breast, beef teriyaki, orange chicken, chicken katsu, and tofu teriyaki. You can also opt for a two protein meal as well.

A bowl will have stir fry veggies on the side. The plates have a choice of a fresh green salad, mac salad or stir fry veggies.

Base: white rice, brown rice or veggies.

Extras: extra meat $1.99; spicy .50; noodles or fried rice substitution is $1.00

So, in my two visits I have had a spicy chicken and beef plate and a yakisoba plate. The noodles were no bueno-- I would pass on that. Tastes like the instant kind that I could of just made at home. The spicy add-on was well worth the extra charge though.

I feel like all of their business comes from people that are coming from the gym and think they are picking up a healthy meal. I would feel a lot better about their food if the portions were consistent and the price stayed under $10. I didn't even order a drink and my plate was still almost $13 for lunch.

We started with some cocktails which were very well made, strong and with great flavor. They also served bread and some excellent spread - I believe it was a salmon spread which was absolutely superb. I would have bought multiple jars of it on the spot if I could. Honestly, for me, it was so good it may have just been the highlight of the meal.

For an appetizer I got a squash soup which was quite tasty, but I've had better squash soups at Michael Mina, Circo, Mastros, etc. which are roughly the same price range. Again, it was good though, the flavor was there and the consistency was very good.

My entree was the braised short rib. This was the other highlight of the meal. It was cooked to perfection - soft, tender, melt in your mouth good. And unlike many other nice places, they didn't skimp on the sauce they put around it which I was very pleased about. The rest of the plate left something to be desired though, it came with some greens and as I recall some mashed potatoes both of which were flavorless and seemed like total afterthoughts to the protein.

Desserts were entirely forgettable. As is the case with so many nice places and group meals they don't actually ask or provide desserts, but instead leave a sampler tray of their desserts in miniaturized form. This is always so disappointing because if there's something good, there's so little of it. But to be honest, there wasn't much good, plenty of little treats loaded with heavy creams.

For me, Bouchon is good, but I'd rather go to one of the Strip's many other top restaurants.",2014-02-06 17:42:51

Went for lunch today.  They are now offering lunch portions (at lower prices), and honestly they are still pretty huge!  My wife and I were not able to finish either of our dishes.  We each have another meal from the leftovers.  For 99 cents you can add either soup or salad to a lunch entree.

The food is good, the portions are large, and they do a lot of coupons (which make the price quite reasonable).  Without a coupon they are a little expensive, though not outrageous.  Join their e-club and you'll get coupons in email, plus they have them in the paper and sometimes in coupon mailers.  So they aren't difficult to get.

Today I tried their Tuscan bean soup.  I think it would have been good if it weren't so salty.  I mean really salty!  But behind the salt I could taste what seemed like a decent bean soup.  This is the only thing I remember having a problem with at Buca.  But they replaced it with minestrone, and that was pretty good.

I really wanted to like this place, I did. I'm not sure what other people's experience of ""Thai"" food is according to other reviews but this is not authentic Thai food. This is as authentic Thai as much as imitation crab is authentic crab. The food, while not horrible, is lacking so much of what makes Thai food what it is. The sign of a good Thai place is how well they do their Pad Thai (well at least for me it is). As another reviewer mentioned, their pad thai is a clump of noodles with all the wrong flavours. Sadly enough, this is the kind of Pad Thai most people are used to. Seriously though, just watch a few youtube videos of Pad Thai being made in the streets of Thailand and tell me that you still think that orange/neon/glow-in-the-dark Pad Thai that is served here in Toronto is legit.

Immediately on arrival the feeling is quite different from your typical Japanese restaurant. You walk down a corridor beside a lighted pathway of pebbles stones and feel the atmosphere change as you enter. You are greeted by a professional hostess in a suit. Very Japanese. Your dinner reservation is treated seriously. Inside the restaurant the theme is minimalism. The sushi bar is unlike any other it is all open with plenty of room for several chefs to prepare the fish. It was a busy Saturday night in the restaurant. We had to wait approximately 10 min before the hostess came back to explain the menu. We ordered the sashimi omakase for one, sushi course for one and suki-nabe beef hotpot. The 3-4 appetizers were tasty  and left you wanting more. These are premade and brought out mostly to everyone who also orders the omakase. The chawan mushi was very smooth. The beef hot pot was small and there were no accompaniments. There was one large piece of hida gyu beef and a few roots and noodles. It felt like an appetizer. The portion is for one person. For $60 I expected some vegetables and at least a bowl of rice. Next came the sashimi and sushi which are variations of the same fish. This included Scottish trout, Halifax tuna, scallop and uni from Japan, sea bream, red snapper, fluke, toro, horse mackerel, anago eel. I'm probably missing a few. The fish was very fresh. Presentation was artful. Service was excellent. They try to explain all the dishes in detail for you to complete the experience. Dessert was also a mix of different things like the appetizers. Coffee jello, soybean milk ice cream and mochi. We also ordered the black sesame ice cream. This was pre scooped which I didn't expect. The ice cream tasted frozen and not very smooth. Overall an expensive authentic Japanese restaurant. The only things I noticed were: There is very little variation and options available on the menu and the pre made appetizers and desserts make it feel too structured and a bit cafeteria style. It is also very expensive. For two adults and a young child we spent $360.

As most Ben & Jerry's are, they're not very big inside. This one has a nice little patio-type area & several small tables inside.

Cheerful employees & a clean store.

Of course, you can buy ""by the pint"" flavors, which may or may not be found in the frozen section at your grocery store.",2011-09-29 16:18:49

So if you're an AZ resident or come from money, you're golden!
Or just live in AZ for a year to establish residency and then apply for the semester after your year is complete so you can get the resident tuition which is MUCH cheaper.


I go to Tempe and West, and both campuses are cool!
I would definitely recommend because the school is rad and I've liked all of my professors so far!",2013-01-31 01:35:13

The selection for drinks they have is very extensive. Huge variety of drinks on tap as well as having a decent cocktail menu. Genesee lager for $3?! What a steal! The cocktail menu changes every once in awhile to keep it fre$h. My recommendation would be to get the drink with basil and strawberry syrup! On point.

What really attracts me to this place is the ambiance. I feel very comfortable here. The place doesn't get too crowded but at the same time it's never really dead inside. Inside you can be mellow. Have small talk at the bar or in front of the projector. Outside the atmosphere is a little different. Watch local bands play or just take a seat and admire those cool string lights you wish you had at home.

This place just touches on every point of what a 5 star place should be. Customer service, ambiance, and drinks at a great price point.

Tip! $20 Charge minimum for card! So bring some cash! They'll appreciate it.",2015-08-31 21:42:56

I thought the food was ok, I ordered the home-smoked chicken with very creamy tomato sauce. It's rich and thick, plus a bit (not a lot) of tomato sauce.

The service was extremely slow though. We didn't get our orders in until almost an hour after sitting down. Then the food came long long later, because they wanted the food to come together. The dinner was like almost 3 hours long. Even though really slow service, the waitress was nice (like 7/10 rating).

I think the price is way too much for the food and the slow service. But it is still a decent restaurant.",2016-08-14 09:34:51

However, when compared to other taco joints or mexican food, it is just very average. I love mexican food and the food here lacks the authenticity of other places... But this should be obvious since its in a casino. 
My problem is that they are very very pricey. For two people, it was $54. The food was good and it was discounted for gamblers, but if I had to pay over $50 for the quality I would be upset.
Definetly people should come here and try it out, just know the quality isn't worth the price.",2014-11-30 02:56:27

They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  There's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.

The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  They had a variety of pizza to choose from.  While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.

The place really isn't meant for ""Pizza Snobs"" to enjoy a quality pie.  It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, ""Macaroni and Cheese Pizza"" as one of the types).

There were teens and families with small children everywhere.  I was the only person not there with someone under 18.",2012-02-01 09:39:03

The server we had was cool and so were the interiors.

Oh, I forgot to mention the soup dumplings. I'd never had them before, and I'm in love. Ours were filled with pork and crab. Awesome. Go.",2013-08-04 00:50:50

Si vous y allez en espÃ©rant prendre votre cafÃ© assis tranquille Ã  une table, vous prÃ©fÃ©rerez sans doute aller ailleurs. La place est toujours remplie et c'est assez bruyant.

Wish they had more than one man restrooms.  This is a coffee place, after all.  They never put enough  toilet paper for the am rush.

Parking is available,  but can be crazy at yimes. However,  I'm sure this building is at a premium,  because of the location.  Therefore,  it's accepted.

They have 3 cook to order station where you can get Fajitas,Quesadillas, burgers,hot dogs, and stir fry. They also have a small salad bar but i have to admit the lettuce had seen better days.

I had enough caffeine when I decided to stop at this Starbucks.  I was in the area when I received an e-mail message from Starbucks.  The message stated that I had one more mobile order to receive 75 bonus points and I had the rest of the day to take advantage of this deal.  Sweet!!  I was in need of a good Americano, was in the area, and found this Starbucks through Yelp.  Honestly, I didn't even know that this Starbucks even existed.  By the way, it's very close to Cinnaholics and the future Trader Joe's.  I placed my order, had them add some extra cinnamon, paid through my app, and picked up my coffee.  I didn't have to wait at all and didn't interact with a single employee.  By the time I walked out, Starbucks sent me a congratulatory e-mail stating that my next meal or drink is on them.

We did not know what we were walking into, but boy did we enjoy it! From the moment we entered the door we were greeted & told how to order. There were plenty of options, from ice cream in a cup, to ice cream in a waffle cone, shakes, smoothies or an ice cream sandwich. They have a variety of milk based products for customers to choose from, then you choose your flavor, your toppings and what form you'd like it in.
I chose the chocolate ice cream with a milk protein base, Nutella, brownie bites and mini marshmallows mixed in...all in a waffle cone. YUMMMMM!!!!
My fiancÃ© ordered the pistachio with milk protein base, honey and chocolate syrup mixed in and banana on top with more honey & chocolate drizzle on top as well, along with it being in a waffle cone.
Both were so delicious, words nor pictures do these delectables justice! Might I mention, the waffle cones are made to order....so they tasted so fresh & yummy! 
But those aren't the only surprises at this hidden gem, they mix the ice cream right in-front of you with nitro & it is super cool!!! EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THIS PLACE!!! I posted a tiny video of the ice cream we ordered being made so you can view for yourself! :)",2018-05-29 17:13:02

My only concern is that I feel like we were over charged. 3 all you can eat dinners at 21.95 each come out to under $66 but our bill was $81. We didn't realise until we already left but it seems very strange that that happened.
