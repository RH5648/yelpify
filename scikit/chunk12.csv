It has taken the top of my list for chimichanga(vegetarian, with tofu) no less. I've never even had anything like it before and it was quite amazing. Similar style to Burrito Drive with fresh vegetables and TOFU mixed in. Quite a large serving. The rice and beans was amazing also - probably the best I've ever had. The price was about what i expect. I'm really excited to try other parts of this restaurant's menu such as the Udon Bowl.",2014-07-06 23:50:15

ZLB3_SyQXiV2GrKlnmkTpg,NeOIp8tz0kfxtmA8YUPmJA,WyC9ELMNH9p2KYOc9PmJLQ,5,3,0,0,"So. Let me start by saying....Xtend had me at hello.  I know, I know...I thought I had a first love at another barre studio but thissssss place I think is and will be my forever love. Two reasons:

Reason one:  Jane. Her voice, her instruction, her encouragement, her.  I came 30 minutes early and the owner introduced me to Jane...Jane showed me around, told me what to expect and told me the best place to stand so I was in the corner and not soooooo exposed.  Thank you...I am so new at Barre and I know no one is watching but still...I'm an introvert/extrovert and I just like being in a corner until I am comfortable. 

Reason Two:  Her class was intense, easy to follow and effective and HARD but In a good way!! We spent an intense amount of time warming up and working on core and arms and then onto the bar for legs.  Omg legs.  I shook like a leaf.  But that's ok ...I plan on having buns o'steel come January. Then after that ....more core work!! The moves she had us doing were insane.  I'm a beginner and could only do so much but I was totally inspired that I knew if I kept coming I would get better. 


What I like about this class is that it was equally as hard as my first experience BUT I didn't feel so out of place or exposed because the moves focused less on flexibility but just sheer toning, and endurance.  I'm going on ""Black Friday"".  

I also like that I can now take this class 4 times a month starting in December thanks to Class Pass.  I dare say that I just might convert to a full membership after a while!! Try this place if you are new or a pro!!",2015-11-24 03:00:03

However, I would recommend anyone who wants to try a little bit of the Brazilian tastes without spending a lot - if you don't eat that much and you go to a ""churrascaria"" (steakhouse) they will charge you a price that will mostly not pay off.

The food was very good, even for Brazilian standards - it was definitely not like, well, since there are not many places in which you can find this kind of food, let's not put much effort in it. We had the picanha (rump cover) with mandioca frita (fried cassava), and I didn't know that I was missing so much this taste because I never enjoyed cassava that much, but it was really one of the best that I had, ever - not greasy as you would usually expect. And the meat was very good - although it accompanies a lot of fat, this is how Brazilians like it. I am kind of an exception on that aspect.

After that, a ""quatro queijos"" pizza (four cheeses), which carries Brazilian mozzarella, parmeggiano, gorgonzola and catupiry - a soft and salty cheese created in the region of Minas Gerais but that you can find anywhere in Brazil. They really reproduce the feel of a Brazilian pizza there; I don't know if it's the dough, how they bake the pizza, but that's it.

Of course, everything being washed down with plenty of Guaraná Antarctica - a soda which is made from guaraná, a fruit from the region of the Amazon.

I was eager to try the brigadeiro (a kind of chocolate pudding), but I was so full that I couldn't.

The overall service was good, the servers were very nice, always checking if everything was OK. The appearance and feeling of the place is also comfortable: the background music is not loud, the lighting is in the right dose, and so on.

So, I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I urge all of you that never tried Brazilian food to go to this place. You won't regret!",2010-01-24 03:59:24

The focus is on seafood with fresh fish flown in weekly. The menu features a ""Fresh Catch"" selection which changes weekly. The fresh catch can be ordered as part of a salad, or on a sandwich, or on a platter with two sides. There are also other items on the menu if seafood isn't your thing, or just not what you want today. Check out the Jerk Chicken!!! ""Raw Bar"" selections are available along with several starters and sides, and some very good desserts! 

From the starter menu, I've had the Conch Fritters and the Conch Chowder - both are excellent! As noted earlier, there are several  sides to choose from, but my favorite is the Caribbean Rice! From the fresh catch list, I've had the Mahi, Swordfish, and Halibut - all excellent! You can select your catch from the availability of the week and then have it prepared how you like it, including blackened, grilled, or fried. Most (if not all) desserts are made in-house, but do yourself a favor and try the bread pudding!  It is no doubt some of the very best bread pudding I've had anywhere!

They also have a full bar with a variety of beer, wine and other liquors.There is also a patio for outside dining.

Chef Earl and his wife Michelle have put a LOT into this new venture and I'm clearly impressed. It is not part of a franchise or a chain. The island ""vibe"" in the restaurant is very nice and service has been excellent! 

This gem is a little hard to find, but they are in the Fountains Shopping Center at the corner of Ardrey Kell Road and Tom Short Road. It is located back in a corner, by the fountain, with colorful umbrellas outside on the patio. KEEP LOOKING, it's worth it!!",2018-06-16 15:04:35

Potato salad - this mix of uncooked potatoes, globs of mayo and not much else caused vomiting and nausea for one person dining last night.

Mac and Cheese - possibly the worst version of this dish west of the Mississippi. One customer put it best ""had better out of the box"" Watery, not cheesy, strange noodles.
Carolina Cole Slaw - large pieces of poorly cut cabbage only saturated in terrible dressing
Baked Beans - uncooked beans in an odd tasting sauce BBQ sauce. Inedible
Cornbread - this needs a new recipe. Hard and flavorless little muffins

MEAT: The Ribs were a mess, but they looked good. They were neither baby back or st, louis and had big knuckles on them of fat making it difficult to eat. Not falling off bone and just cooked by an amateur.
Chicken - nothing special, but probably the best meat.
Brisket - fatty slices and not enough of them on the $15 2 meat platter.

I wouldn't really call this a restaurant - it's set up more like a lunch deli. You wait in line to place an order, you pour your own drink into styrofoam cups using the self-serve fountain, you find whatever seat you can, and wait for your food. 

Now, the way this place works is like many places who are adopting this trend where you place your order and take a number to your table and someone brings your food to you when it's ready. It means you don't have waiters really, but you also don't have to stand around waiting to pick up your order... If you want to tip, they have a tip jar.

The seating is very cheap and ugly, but it's comfortable and you're not really here for the ambience. You come here for good food at a decent price with no signifigant hassle. It's your lunch spot if you work in the area. There's really no reason to make a special trip here, but if you're checking out car dealerships or doing some shopping or on a lunch break - it's a solid choice.

They do catering - even on short notice. A lot of businesses in the area do take-out here. They have pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, and the standard fare. We ordered a pizza, a sandwich and a pasta dish. They have great meatballs and stuffed pasta. The pizza looked delicious, but we're saving it for dinner. Their sandwich bread is a little ""artisan"" for my taste (artisan translates to dry and stale as far as I'm concerned), but they use quality meats and cheeses. 

The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the food is solid and reliable. You can't really go wrong. I still prefer DeFalco's by a mile, but if I ever end up in this area, I might go again.",2008-02-01 22:40:49

The waffle wasn't hollow on the insides like some other places I've tried.

I told her there wasn't a wait the first time I went but if there is a wait we will order some wine to pass the time. 

Big mistake. The wait was long which is not the problem. The hostess still didn't know what was going on. We wanted to order a drink while we waited so the hostess said she would send the cocktail waitress over. I understand they were busy but when she finally came over to take our drink orders she was not very friendly. About twenty minutes go by and she brought me my water but still hasn't served my mom or sister the wine they ordered. Then she came over with the bill in hand and gave us our total. I told her that we still haven't received our drinks and asked for the tab but she wouldn't give it to me and very rudely responded that she can't carry the glasses and the bill at the same time, as if I was stupid. I handled this very calmly because I did not want to upset my sister and just asked for the bill. It was very awkward because she wouldn't give it to us so finally my sister just gave the waitress her card and paid for her own drinks. 

When we were seated the restaurant started clearing out.  The server we had seemed to be brand new or he was a bus boy that was given our table. He forgot to bring us a few things but overall he was friendly, very nice and patient with us. 

I have an issue with people who are rude for no reason. If you can't handle working in a busy environment please find a job that makes you happy.

Clean interior with tables positioned close together in a tight space. Loud chatter and background noise during a Sunday brunch.

FOOD
Unique and tasty brunch offerings, which is the main reason I like this spot. Pancakes and waffles are delicious and all, but occasionally my taste buds crave something more exotic. Coca Cafe does the job right. 

I've always gotten the Fried Eggplant Benedict. If this is your first time here, get this now and thank me later. Not a huge fan of eggplant? Don't worry, it doesn't have an overwhelming taste. Two servings of fried eggplant and poached eggs on top of its own english muffin, topped with roasted tomatoes and doused in--wait for it--BASIL hollandaise sauce. Tasted a bit like pesto mixed in with hollandaise sauce, and let me tell you, it was heavenly.

This time I ventured out and tried a new dish. The Smoked salmon omelet was solid, but it felt like something was missing...maybe some sort of sauce would have taken it to a new level. Along with bits of salmon, the omelet also had a generous amount of goat cheese, a bit of dill, and a few sliced baby tomatoes inside. I'm pretty sure it was a typo on the menu because instead of ""smoked"" salmon, it was ""cooked"" salmon. Still good, but it wasn't what was advertised. If it had some sort of sauce to add to the texture and provide a sort of moistness, I think it could become a very good dish. For now, I'll stick with the Eggplant Benedict.

SERVICE
I've never waited so long (on premise) for food before. Put our phone number down and was told 1 hour 15 min. After waiting the full length of time, we went back to check on our status. Apparently they wrote down the wrong phone number or something since they claimed they called but we never got it. After finally being seated, it took another 20 or so minutes to get our food. Total time we waited from putting down our name to food on table was 2 hours!!! NOT COOL. The atmosphere seemed kinda of hectic. Lots of movement, loud chatter from other nearby tables, and long waits. This is probably the main reason I don't come that much, but if I do, I go right when they open. 

IMPRESSIONS
At first thought, ""adventurous"" and ""comfort food"" don't seem to go together, but neither do Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna. I was wrong, on both counts!  

You know a certain dish like the Fried Eggplant Benedict is special when you only associate it with the one restaurant, and you can't seem to muster the courage to order something else every time you visit. Just make sure you come early. Or you might be waiting 2 hours :(",2015-02-22 23:27:23

I have been meaning too check this place out after hearing the buzz and looking at the pics it all looks really really good. I really am digging the sign/logo of the restaurant.

The prices are supa reasonable up and down the whole menu. The portion size for tapas style is really good size more so then other tapas style places been too in my experience. Love the diversity of the menu also wide range from cornish hen, bone marrow soup, more tradition pho dishes, or beef salad. Just talking about the entrees. 

I no idea best place too start my District One Kitchen & Bar experience but the Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was on my radar. It the perfect soup too clear my running nose and sinus. Boy did it not disappoint! The broth had nice kick too it. But not over the top that not enjoy the full body of the broth. One of the best things about it is diversity of meats in it. Counted four different ones in the bowl. Really each time dug deep find another different treat in every scoop. It nice hearty Pho dish. Any sign of good Pho is no need too add anything more too the broth. The appetizers was tough but went with the Beef Buns. Talking about Buns in my last review Beef Buns brought back that same urge Bun crazy! They do have peking duck buns too believe but went with the pork buns. Talk about addicting get three per order but popping them down so easy wish order half dozen or hell could have done dozen. Really that good!! The pork is cooked nice crispy outside, moist inside, and glaze or sauce cooked in was fabulous could have ordered plate of pork! The topping of think hoisen or oyster sauce combine with garnish of julienne carrots and couple other things. The steam bun itself was the perfect Steam Bun with the perfect filling. 

The service was awesome. I torn between the tacos and beef buns waiter recommending the beef buns. Save the tacos for next time. No doubt be few more times because lot of good stuff on the menu. Just happen ran into fellow yelpers Misti and Bobby. They were kind enough ask if wanted too join them. It was just me doing my yelp diligent checkout out all the ONO spots in Vegas. Lol!!

We found a more than adequate substitute in TJ on Detroit Rd. Sandwiches are reasonably priced (many under 6 bucks) and they have a good selection of chips and drinks as any good grab and go deli should. The sandwiches are so tender and delicious. They use some sort of machine called the 'Fresh-O-Matic' to somehow make the sandwiches super tender but not soggy. I know. Straight out of the 60's.

A tiny zen rock garden sits behind the door, and back-lit lights beams through the soft coloured wooden slats featuring the Zen logo in the middle of the hallway leading you into the restaurant itself.

Inside, the prominent feature is the large sushi bar where four chefs work swiftly to slice fish, remove pinbones, and deftly shape rice into sushi pieces.  If you sit at the bar, you can have the option to have them served piece by piece to eat them at optimal freshness.

Perhaps before you decide to come here for dinner, you should know that Zen is pricey.  Dinners are omakase only, and you can choose from one of three price ranges: $65 for miso soup, 12 pieces of sushi, and one handroll.  The other prices were about ~$85 followed by ~$100.  This is where my primary issue with Zen lies - I don't feel that the pricing is justified for what you receive.

The rice tastes pretty much like plain rice to me.  It doesn't do a lot to enhance the flavour of the fish.  Several times, the rice would crumble apart before the piece reached my mouth - despite my careful swipe in soy sauce, fish-side down, even picking up the sushi with my fingers instead of chopsticks.  The same thing happened to my dining companions.

The soy sauce was definitely not Kikkoman, but it didn't seem to have any distinguishing features either.  If memory recalls correctly, diners at the sushi bar didn't have soy sauce dishes, as the sushi was brushed with sauce prior to serving.  I wish it was the same for table-diners.

The fish was fresh, but not so amazing that I haven't had better elsewhere in Toronto.  The wasabi ratio was not exactly the same for each diner, so while one had a large glob for one diner, another exact piece had hardly any.  

The negitoro handroll served after the sushi plate was pretty good.  Filled with  negitoro and shaped like a sausage roll, the seaweed was perfectly crispy.

Service was very, very slow.  We waited 50 minutes for the sushi to arrive.
The service was friendly, but there wasn't much of it.  The paper which was wrapped around our (made in Japan!) chopsticks was never picked up/discarded.  Our table was skipped for tea refills a couple of times, though other tables were offered another pour.  The kindly waitstaff apologized for the long wait, but 50 minutes is a long time.

Maybe it's because we came at a late hour.  Due to the popularity of this restaurant, we nabbed the last spot possible at 9pm.  Based solely on my experience this weekend though, I can't help but wonder what made Zen so popular in the first place.

5_LTBSzdaAnwkOAt-Audcg,3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,XhUec_6-kgPy1_ZYUrzvPQ,3,0,0,0,"Came here tonight for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and based on the yelp reviews had somewhat high expectations but somewhat let down. 

We had dinner reservations for 730. I asked for a booth seating unfortunately there weren't any available. They sat us by the window where you can see the meat getting cooked on the grill. For some reason I felt like that area wasn't really ""inside"" the restaurant although I know it was.

There was more seating passed this area and from our seats it looked like there could possibly be an outside view, but we didn't really get to see what that area looked like from where we were seated. 

They started us off with a bread basket with butter that had olive oil.  Good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  For our meals, I orders the wagyu short rib and my boyfriend ordered the 20 oz bone in rib eye. The menu said we had a choice of 3 sauces (bernaise, peppercorn, boredelaise) for the ribeye. However our waiter failed to ask us what he wanted. I only remembered about 20 mins after the order and asked our waiter about it. We also ordered a side of wild mushrooms. 

I felt like the wait for our food was a little too long. It didn't seem that busy inside the area where we were seated but who knows what it looked like on the other side. 

We finally got our food from what seemed like a 30 minute wait. Both portions were huge!  However both the steak and short ribs just tasted ok. I felt like I've had better. The peppercorn sauce didn't do anything for me  My boyfriend felt the same way. 

I don't think our waiter was attentive enough. They did remember I had mentioned on the reservation it was my boyfriend's birthday so they brought out a complimentary dessert (see pic).  However it kind of irked me there was no ""Happy Birthday"" message on the dessert (as I've seen in other pics). I know, not a big deal, but those attention to detail, special touches is what makes the visit memorable. 

Overall, for a pricey steak restaurant, the service was somewhat lacking. They didn't come back to follow up if we wanted cocktails until the middle of our dinner, the waiter forgot an essential part of the steak order, and he didn't check up on us much. We got more attention from the busboy.

I don't think I'd come back here again if I'm in the mood to spend my money on an expensive meal. I don't know if I can recommend this place either.  There's definitely other steakhouses out there that are worth the money.",2014-01-25 08:00:49

This is the second of 2 locations. The other location is the larger restaurant with a full menu. This location is the smaller one with a condensed menu of some of the local favorites. Each day they have a list of specials that help expand their menu options. They also have a cooler with Hawaiian sun juices and some local desserts to complete your meal. 

Today we got the kalua pig with no cabbage, 1/2 order of ahi poke with avocado and mixed plate with teriyaki chicken and hamburger steak. 

Kalua pig comes with 2 scoops rice and Mac salad which taste great. They use corse ground pepper which makes it have a more peppery taste but I like it. The kalua pig is good. Not to salty, not to smoky, juuuuust right. 

The ahi poke is good and one of my wife's favorites. It has just enough sauce without drowning out the flavor of the fish. 

The mixed plate was great. It also comes with Mac salad and 2 scoops of rice. This is the first time I've had their Teri chicken and I must say that it was sooooo good. The marinade is on point and the grilled flavor kicks it up a notch. I will for sure order that again on its own. The hamburger steak was good. They have one of the best gravy around.

I've only had Smashburger once before. My coworkers picked me up a Sin City burger from one of the earlier Vegas locations. I remember it being a well-balanced burger and I enjoyed the experience.

Fast forward to now. They finally opened a location closer to work. I again ordered a Sin City burger. This time, I asked for the multi-grain bun. I added a side of Smash Fries. They are the same price as regular fries, but add rosemary, olive oil, and garlic to the mix.

The short of it? The fries were salty and the burger was good but not great. The bacon on the burger overwhelmed the overall flavor. It may have been compounded by the salty fries. By the end, I was thankful to be done eating.

I'm handing out the good old 3-star treatment for now. I'll definitely return to try a different burger and probably skip the fries. On the positive side, they just opened and were handling the lunch rush quite well.

Smalls Balls - risotto, short rib, parmesan, tuscan sauce --- my favorite dish

Cow Western - bbq burger sliders
Lettuce Cups - shrimp, slaw, mango - server recommended and I enjoyed
Bacon Wrapped Dates - I didn't try but everyone else loved
Corn Dogs - another favorite of the table

Average Plates:
Chicken & Waffle Fries - not great, but OK
Shorty (braised short rib) - good flavor, could have been better

Stay Away:
Mac & Cheese Flatbread - horrible... no flavor and nothing added. just plain mac and cheese spread over a plain flat bread.
Grilled PB & J - everyone seems to love this on Yelp... nobody in my group enjoyed. way overrated. was very bland and jelly is on side which makes it kind of difficult
Green Beans - this is what I would like to call a ""GOTCHA DISH"" at an AYCE. Sounds good till you order it and its a huge mound of fried green beans that nobody wants to look at let alone eat. These tasted good but not worth getting with other items available.

We ordered the rigatoni and Affumicato pizza. Both were so good! I love that there are 2 sizes for the pizza so you're not forced to feel like you have to finish the medium.

I first came here during my lunch break after noticing the cute sign. I wasn't sure what to get so I played it safe and got two mango diamond, which is mango slush with real mango pieces. What didn't impress me was the inconsistency in volume. In my picture, you can see that one is filled more than the other. The taste on the other hand was pretty good. 

The second time i went here I decided to order a specialty drink: Fresh fruit four seasons green tea. This drink has watermelon, lime, orange, strawberry, kiwi, and passion fruit in it and OH MY GOD the fruit fused with green tea tasted sooooo good. The fruits and green tea were perfectly balanced and very refreshing to drink. A fork is also included to eat the fruits after lol. 

A really cool thing that I noticed is that there is an espresso type machine that the baristas use to brew the tea bags. Each drink uses one tea bag and are brewed to order. Other teahouses I frequent have certain tea drinks pre made already.

So I tried this a couple of times now and I can write an good review. 

this place was initially 3 stars but after comparing to other Korean BBQ in vegas it went up to 4. 
It's get your own stuff style K-BBQ which the more I have it the better I think it is. 

Highlights: 
Dont need to finish junk you dont want to get more of the stuff you do want
Will try different things because its not a whole plate . 
As much sauce as you want 
As much or as little banchans as you want. 
the flank steak is the best item there imo, most palce dont have it cause its a more expensive meat, its what real carne asada is made with. 

cons: 
limited on type of meats
sometimes the meat looks not so fresh, but you can jsut avoid that stuff since it's pick you own.

The taste of the food itself is actually pretty good. All you can eat ($14) included pork, beef, chicken, fish fillets, and squid. There were a couple of basic sides included as well. 

The problem with grilling the fish fillets is that they would break up and are too fragile to cook on the grill. They also didn't have any marinade on them. All of the other meats were marinaded and were good. The chicken was a little too fatty for my taste though. 

They didn't have the oil and salt and used Chinese chili oil instead of Korean chili sauce.

This bar type restaurant with TVs at most booths really capitalized on their namesake by hanging bikes all over the restaurant. They are giving away this particular bike.

We chose the Onion Tanglers appetizer, lightly breaded thin onion circles fried crispy that melted in your mouth.  The dipping sauce possessed a little kick.

Dora here. haha, just a little. Enough heat to ramp up your tongue without burning.:) But a tad greasy for my liking.

I ordered the ""Build a Dog"" with cole slaw and chili. Our server told us that these were Nathan hot dogs so I was confident in their quality. The large dogs, loaded with slaw and chili, were great. The only negative was the standard bun, over toasted and dry.

Dora here. Bummer. I went with the Trek burger topped with caramelized onions, Gorgonzola, steak sauce, and chipotle mayo. The burger was good, but a bit overloaded with steak sauce. I devoured most of the sweet tater tots, but ditched the syrup. I would've preferred a sprinkling of brown sugar rather than syrup. Yeah, go ahead and tell me I'm spoiled. I'll admit it.:)

Still Dora here. Our grandson really enjoyed his grilled cheese sandwich and was enthralled with the decor. He would definitely  vote for a return visit.:) The inside was clean and the service quick and friendly. In Charlotte, the private parking lot is always a bonus.

Do you frequent restaurants because your kids or grandkiddos like them?

We were seated right away and our bartender/waiter was quick to give us waters. After reviewing the HH menu, we ordered two Moscow Mules ($7 each) and the pizzetta guanciale ($7). I asked the bartender if the pizza was enough to share and he confided that if he had to share the pizza, he'd be angry. We decided to chance it, since we were going somewhere else afterwards. Fortunately, the pizza was plenty for us! It was so good we wanted to order another but decided against it. Note: The menu says the pizza only comes with fontina, Yukon potato, and caramelized onion. However, in addition to those items, it had mushrooms and prosciutto on it. This was delicious, but if you don't eat meat, be aware.

This Fox concept is most similar to True Food - the same level of healthy (great ingredients, great taste) with a simpler menu at lower prices.  The charming open layout is also reminiscent of True Food but cuter and more casual.  Even the bathrooms are beautiful - stainless steel and art deco.

But let's cut to the chase: the yummy food.  The menu boasts a wonderful selection of sides and proteins, which you can mix and match.  There are also plenty of salads, wraps and appetizers. It took us ages to order with all of the excellent choices.

Our food was delicious!!  I had Salmon with Organic Smashed Potatoes and Heirloom Tomatoes - the potatoes were magically creamy and flavorful (order this!) and the tomatoes were perfectly ripe.  The generous portion of salmon was tasty - cooked nicely.   I stole a bite of my husband's Thai Dye Wrap, and it had great flavor - even the actual wrap tasted good!

 We arrived about 8:15 and the place was pretty busy.  We found a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers and cheese sticks.  I guess they didnt hear our order because we received Pretzels and cheese instead.  Not a big deal but WTF.... 

 They had music playing and a customer who looked somewhat like Jabba the Hut (seriously) wasnt satisfied with the volume turned it up many times and the staff kept turning it down.  This was happening while many families were there trying to enjoy there meals.

This bar came complete with a overweight drunk girl that was making her way around the bar and kissing multiple guys and trying to jam her tongue as far down their throat as possible.  She apparently was friends with the young female bartender who continued to watch her and give her shots.  I guess I expect this at other places such as Roman's Oasis but what a treat to see this while enjoying a few beers and Pretzels.  

Dont stop reading......  We are just getting to the good part.   

I noticed a drunk young guy sitting at the end of the bar.  He had a baseball cap on and his face was very red.  His eyes were closed from time to time while he was waiting for his friends to return.  I could tell he was trashed...  I told my wife to take and look and sure enough when she did, he threw up a little bit on the bar and his hand.  He cleaned it up a bit but just sat there.   I told both the bartenders and they did NOTHING....   A few minuted later he had major projectile vomit at the bar.    I told the manager (who apparently couldnt see what we were watcing) and he went to talk to the customer.  The manager asked him to leave but I guess in not a very forceful way because the customer finished his beer and then left.   

The end of our incredible visit was capped off by the following event.  The bartender came and told me that ""the guy at the end of the bar wants to buy you a drink"".  I asked ""does he want to buy me a drink or my wife?"".  She stated that he wanted to buy us both a drink.  I told her ""no thank you"".  My wife went to the restroom shortly after this and ""the guy at the end of the bar"" followed her.  He returned before she did and came over to talk to me.  He explained that he was a regular at the bar and continued talking to me about a bunch of nonsense and soon I just ignored him until he left.  I am confused why a self proclaimed college student would want to buy us drinks. 

This place needs help...   I am not sure the owner knows this is going on.  If the owner is the manager I spoke to, then he is in way over his head.

A medium to small sized joint to enjoy dinner and start your Friday bar crawl. Most patrons here are dressed in casual to semi-formal or business attire. 

The environment is fairly loud. You have to practically yell to be heard by the person across the table, and people sitting next to each other still had trouble hearing each other. This was mainly the result of the music, although the words and language used in most of the songs were indistinguishable. However, the music was clearly a mix of genres, from hip hop and R'n'B to Reggae, from Latin American pop to soft rock from the 80s. Later, in the night, this music was quite upbeat and made everyone want to dance! This appears to be a calculated move, since when hip hop is played on busier nights, the fast music leads to quicker table turnover. 

I ordered the Kaya Juice, a delicious mock tail comprised of mango, guava, cranberry, and pineapple juices. The cranberry juice's bitterness and the muted sweetness of guava temper the overwhelmingly sugary pineapple and mango juices. The conch fritters appeared similar to a pakora, a deep fried and breaded vegetable appetizer featured Indian and Pakistani cuisines. Biting into it yielded a chewy, salty and quite savory taste, made deliciously tangy by lime squeezed on top of it. Underneath the fritters was a green habanero aioli, about as spicy as a teaspoon of Cholula. This was incredibly potent, with a delicious mix of savory ingredients reminiscent of Hispanic Caribbean, potentially Cuban, cuisine.

The entrée was a monthly special, the Bake 'n' Shark burger, composed of lettuce, tomato, tamarind, cilantro, hot sauce, and fried bread. The taste was initially tangy, and slightly sweet from the sauce. Unfortunately, the shark part itself was quite underwhelming. Even though the shark patty was breaded and fried, the fish itself tasted extremely bland, like unseasoned tilapia. The mixture of cucumber, crunchy iceberg lettuce, leafy cilantro and other textures added interesting dimension to this otherwise tasteless dish. Its crunchy, possibly fried hamburger bun felt unusual, like an oily cracker. This and was probably the best part of the entire meal. Indeed, the conch fritters probably overshadowed the main course with their flavor and spice. Yet the shark burger's only selling point was its exotic nature. 

Overall, it was a great experience! Although I found my entrée to be bland, I'm excited to come back and enjoy other plates when the next opportunity arises.",2017-04-04 15:24:47

I'm not gonna lie, I think the price is a little high. I think that it can be cheaper considering that the food is not the healthiest choice. But overall experience was great and would definitely recommend this for big groups.

The must try food are the mussels and spicy beef. It was seasoned wonderfully and may comeback just for that alone. Thank you mandarin for making out group experience an excellent one.",2014-11-06 23:39:59

Their menu is small.  I mean, almost uncomfortably small.  Probably 2/3 the size of Postino's menu, which is already a small (side note:  AMAZING) menu.  

I was told to go here by everyone in creation because of the owners (meaning, the other places in town they own), and because the food is supposedly amazing.

What was amazing:  The staff.  The restaurant itself.  The location.

What was not amazing:  Parking.  The food.

I don't actually eat burgers, so it was my fault for ordering one.  That said, there are NOT a ton of choices for non-lovers of meat... so I ordered a burger because I sometimes get a hankering for one.  ... Medium well was pretty seriously pink.  The meat... was not my favorite flavor.  The bun... well, I love bread and I didn't love this bun.

My co-diner, however, loved her food.

On our first try I wasn't bowled over but as I learn what to order this place really grows on me, its great having this place as a neighborhood restaurant. It's affordable and the food is pretty good overall ...and some dishes are surprisingly good. To start the so called lentil soup that comes with every entree is a lot more than the name implies. It's a mixed veggie, curry, split peas etc etc soup, perfect for a chilly night. The shrimp Madras is very good - when they asked 1 to 5 how hot I said 6!! .. and they still had to bring me more hot sauce, typical of Charlotte. 

But now the humble Chana (Chickpeas) Spinach Masala w/pomegranate, cardemon and spices is absolutely fragrant, spicy and  delicious. This dish could be served in a fine restaurant.

Another surprise: I usually don't go crazy for Asian deserts but we shared a pudding of carrots, raisins, cashews, rice sugar and cream ( Halwah? ) that manage to taste very unusual, yet familiar and delish as well. 

An Indian couple seem to own and run this place, the wife is the cook and she really aims to please. She came out to our table 3 times to talk to us although there were a fair amount of customers - mostly Indians. We had dinner there twice and I think this lady does her best with the vegetarian dishes. I tend to be a meat eater myself but I'll stick to their vegetarian menu in the future

As it's a live music venue, there were performances by bands both nights and I recall the acts being quite good.  I didn't make it back there again until several years later - NYE 2016 -'17 - when a friend and Ii stopped by to briefly check their beer menu.  We didn't stay for drinks that night but I've made several more visits there with 1 or 2 friends since then, therefore I think it's about time I gave the venue a review.

3030 is not considered to be a really large venue although I view it as being somewhat spacious given that it's located in The Junction and I definitely don't consider it to be small.  The stage is at the very back, there are 2 bars on the left side of the venue, 1 of which is further back, closer to the stage.  There is lounge seating at the very front, some pinball machines close to the front and a couple other pinball machines in the back to the right of the stage which either weren't working or weren't turned on when I was last there.  Their regular tables are quite 'decorative' and a variety of paintings adorn their exposed brick wall on the right.  The venue used to have a 'small bites' menu which replaced their dinner menu at 8 pm (at least on certain nights).  I'm not sure if they still have the small bites menu but I recall ordering wedge fries and popcorn chicken from that menu the 1st couple of times I visited and those items were quite good.

I haven't yet had a full meal at 3030 but almost every time I've been I've had at least 1 beer there and their selection is always great: pretty extensive and quite varied in terms of styles.  The last few times I've visited has been for drinks only either mid to late afternoon or earlier in the evening when the venue has been fairly barren therefore the service, as expected, was quite prompt.  I don't recall really slow service the 1st couple of times I was there when it was later in the evening and pretty packed; that was years ago but hopefully that hasn't changed.

I wouldn't consider 3030 an upscale venue but definitely worth a visit if you're in the area, have never been and want to partake in some great beverages (beers) and/or maybe some quality food; if you can make it there at night for a live performance, well there's a 3rd option for you too.",2018-04-10 21:26:58

In fact, I went back a few more times to make sure it wasn't a tasty fluke. My burgers took about 5 minutes each to arrive, but were worth the wait and tasted much, much better than any fast food burgers you can get in 2 minutes. I left the last visit thinking out loud that Smashburger is the ""Starbucks of fast burgers"" because their customization, options, and consistent execution are where they really shine. 

The burger patties themselves are good - not the best I've ever had, but a tasty, solid option. Their avocado club burger had fresh cooked bacon and what looked like a half an avocado on it. The  bbq, bacon, and cheddar burger was sweet, smoky, and salty all at the same time. The truffle mushroom swiss burger is on par with what I'd expect to eat at a much fancier farm to table place. Their (very skinny) fries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic and come in multiple variations.

If you don't see something you like on the menu, customization is the name of the game. You can order custom toppings, sauces, breads, or even sub out the burger for chicken or a black bean burger.

No server in sight. When we indicated that we wanted a particular table, the bartender came out and cleaned it for us, indicating how busy they are. The place was barely half full so...sure? I guess. 

Don't get me wrong, the service was very polite, but when you've been sitting for at least 30 minutes, staring at tables full of greasy dishes and small mountains of chicken bones, you question the operational efficiency and overall hygiene of the restaurant. Eventually, they did clean it up but it wasn't until halfway through our visit. 

The food was your typical bar food. We came here for one reason, and one reason only. GAR PAR FRIES (or gar par poutine is what it's called in the menu, but there's no gravy or cheese curds so don't be fooled). It was really simple stuff, just fries smothered in white garlic sauce and sprinkled with parmesan. Others got wings, which I heard were alright. 

However, never ever order the garden salad as a side for anything. Ever. It is the worst salad I have ever come across. It was DROWNED in some sort of weird brown vinaigrette (maybe, can't tell), and piled with cheese. The sauce made the crunchy bits soggy and the cheese became a brown mush. In a quest to have something healthy along with the wings and fries, the sad salad remained barely touched in a corner of the plate. 

Overall, very meh. There are much better options out there for bar food. If you're in the area, it'll do, but if there's something closer, don't hesitate to go to that instead. The hunt for good gar par fries in the area continues.

I stopped by on a recent trip to Montreal to pick up several dozens of a few different kinds and man, looks like they're cutting corners and quality is at its low. I thought it might be just one of those days but in years past, they've ALWAYS been consistent!

I got mostly sesame seed bagels and a few blueberry, garlic, and cinnamon raisin and they weren't very good. The garlic bagels were especially NOT GOOD! I ended up having to throw them away, thank goodness there were only a few but trust me when I say they were nasty, AND they stunk up my car and house--so not worth the trouble! It would appear that the sesame seed bagels are much bigger than before and definitely do not have that usual Montreal bagel flavour and texture. I mulled this over a while and realized they're using some kind of filler or extra yeast? that makes the bagel more bread-y than bagel. If I want bread with a hole in it that's trying to pass itself off as a bagel, I'll go to Great Canadian Bagel, thank you very much! The blueberry bagels used to be much more purple with more blueberries when sliced open but not this time. They were more of a light blue with a couple of morsels of blueberry; the colour made them look almost synthetic. I didn't get the cinnamon raisins for myself so I didn't get to try them but even if I had the choice, I wouldn't have as I never really liked raisins in my bread. Another thing I noticed is that after letting the bagels cool in the paper bag, as I was putting them in the plastic ones they give you, they were rock hard. They also didn't have the same smell. I ripped one open to see if I was just being paranoid and not only did it not look the same, it didn't feel or taste the same. What's happening???

I always preferred Fairmount over St-Viateur for its variety and overall taste (they're quite similar in taste though, let's not kid ourselves) and for all I know, maybe St-V has upped their game and started offering more flavours but if this lack of quality is a regular feature at Fairmount, I'm going to have to find some other source. I think I've even had better MTL bagels in Toronto than the ones I got from FB recently! I'll have to do my rounds at the kosher bakeries in Toronto that offer MTL bagels when I run out of this batch and if there's a decent place among them, I won't bother doing these bagel runs when I head up to Montreal in the future. And it's not like FB's prices that great!

I'm giving Fairmount 3* as I am hoping I just happened to visit on an off-day. TO give it 2* when I go so seldom hardly seems fair. I'll try them again and see then what the deal is.",2013-08-11 19:01:39

I recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats. People who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group. 

They brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands. There are only about 6 beers on top, so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices.

Oddly enough, I do not eat much pizza at home in Toronto, but I do a lot when traveling. I did some research and became intrigued by Mangia & Bevi. People rave about their pizzas, and they seem to consistently fall in the lists of the best pizzas in Toronto.

I had a hard time deciding whether to give this restaurant a shot because when choosing a pizzeria, I first confirm that they have a wood burning oven, and Mangia & Bevi does not use one. Yet, I made a reservation here anyway because reviewers consistently pointed out how much these pizzas tasted like or were better than wood oven pizzas. Gasp!

The Good

Reservations were easy to make. I did not have a problem getting a large group reservation
The pizzas were good when hot
Prices were decent and comparable to other pizzerias (e.g., Pizzeria Libretto-my favorite pizza in Toronto)
The pastas looked delicious, and the one friend that ordered it loved it-but too pricey

The Not-So-Good

Service was horrendous-we were in a private room and had to go out to the main room to get service. Even after making it known to the manager that no one had taken our orders, or been asked about drinks, we were still ignored and had to get up and search for staff to request for assistance-every time we needed something. It was like the staff pretended that we did not exist
The pizzas turned into cardboard once they cooled. I ate half of my pizza, and did not bother taking the other half home-could not fathom how it could be saved
Bread was not included. We had to pay for every basket of bread

In Sum

You are better off going to Pizzeria Libretto or Pizzeria Defina! Don't waste your time with Mangia & Bevi!

There are a number of restaurants in the same vicinity as Lil' Baci but this is one of the few that stands out. The pizza is delicious, they have a great drink menu and draft beer selection, a good atmosphere and a back patio!

My favourite pizza is the Funghi pizza. It has mushrooms and truffle oil, how can you go wrong with truffle oil? This is a white pizza so there is no tomato sauce. While I think it's the best tasting pizza I've had at Lil' Baci, I think it's best to go with someone else and order this pizza with another more traditional pizza so you get the best of both worlds. 

Other pizzas I've tired are the Fiamma and one with housemade meatballs on it (I believe it was the special that evening). Both were good traditional pizza. Nothing too adventurous just classic delicious pizza. 

Portion size is great. One pizza per person if you're hungry. Even when I'm starving I usually end up with one piece left which is always a treat the next day for lunch. Still it's best to partner up and order two so you get a variety. 

The only thing I've been somewhat disappointed with were the Crostini. We ordered the three for $8 and tried all three that they had on special that evening. One of them (beet and goat cheese) was particularly good, the other two were just ""meh"". All in all, I don't think they were worth the $8 and I'll probably just stick to ordering pizza in the future.

Group of 6 had breakfast here.  Beautiful setting in high ceiling french bistro setting overlooking landscaped pool area.  Got table right away, wasn't full at 9am, but was 2/3 full by the time we left.

Ordered pastry basket which had 4 outstanding pastries ($16).  Ordered coffee, which for drip, was outstanding ($3.50 each).  

I ordered omelet of the day, which was excellent ($16).  Wife ordered sourdough waffles, which may have been best we've ever hard, topped with sauteed bananas ($12).  

Other couple split chicken and waffles.  Waffles had bacon pieces in them, savory.  Chicken was roasted, not fried.  Tender and tasty, with great gravy.

Altogether, with some split meals and other stuff not mentioned, $96 tab for the 6 people.  Everyone ate plenty.

We walked away feeling it was one of the best breakfasts we've had in a long-time.

Unfortunately, it was very underwhelming on a Saturday night, with only usually 2 ladies dancing throughout the night and 1 male Samoan chief doing his own thing on stage.  

Then we have Elvis and Ms. Sheena both botox-out to meet the appearance of youth.  Elvis wasn't too bad, but when Sheena started with Gloria Estefan, it sort of throws this Island Heat dinner into identity crisis.

The grilled cheese is deliciously gooey and the soup was the perfect consistency for dipping. I ordered the Shrimp and Sausage entree and Dave got the Short ribs. Short ribs looked like kind of a small serving but I think it was because of the size of the plate. We also felt there was not enough potato with the short rib. Regardless of size, he wanted to lick the plate clean but I wouldn't let him for fear of embarrassment. My shrimp and sausage dish was perfection. The grits were creamy and buttery and the amount of shrimp served was just right. Dessert time, bacon covered in chocolate? for reals?

Well another year and we are back....  Strangely I order the pork chops here because I am not a heavy red meat eater.

With that said, BUMMER on this years offering.   While tasty, portion size is smaller and the presentation was seriously lacking.   2011 had two bone in chops grilled separately and arranged in a butterfly presentation.  This year it was still two bone in chops, but just that.  Oh there was a very non descript side sauce; shouldn't have bothered sadly enough.

POSITIVE side, the service of the staff inside were spectacular.  So I have to give über kudos for that. 

Will we go back in 2013?  Only if the group wants to.  I am sorry and wished for more....

Go to a steakhouse and order pork chops, yup!   These were probably the best pork chops I have had in a long time.  The confiet (sp?) that was served as garnish was awesome, as was the corn bread...

I tasted someone's steak and it was very good.  I just could not eat two big steak meals two days back to back.   I heard no complaints during the meal or the next day.

We were looking for somewhere new to eat and decided to give this place a try. The giant billboard featuring a mouth-watering slice of key lime pie had been calling me for well over a year now, so tonight was the night to finally make the short drive to Town Square.

Upon arrival at the restaurant I was immediately struck by how friendly the staff were. I didn't get the name of the girl who greeted us, but she was extremely welcoming and let us know that our server, appropriately named ""Tommy"", was excellent. She was certainly right. Tommy was friendly, sharp, congenial, accommodating - everything you want from a waiter. He gave us lots of good advice and engaged us in conversation about the food, ranging from the bread with honey-cinnamon butter, to the excellent lemonade we ordered. He really seemed to have a passion for the menu items and did a great job of at least appearing to delight in our enjoyment of them.

I ordered the Sanibel Stuffed Chicken and my wife got the Antigua Quesadillas appetizer and a variety of sides to share with me. We both loved our food and were particularly taken by one of the sides, the enormous basket of plantain chips, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and served with a black bean, charred corn salsa with lime sour cream.

Around halfway through our meal the idea of eating the key lime pie that had lured us there in the first place began to look like a bit of a pipe dream - but we were so happy we decided, what the heck. Two slices to go.

Overall our experience here was wonderful, particularly helped by the pleasant outdoor dining section and the lovely early April weather. My only minor criticism of the place is the lack of any real vegetarian ""main"" option for my wife. She was more than happy with what she had, but a little variety would call us back all the more often. That tiny gripe aside, Tommy Bahama was the complete dining experience for me and everything that is good about a meal out. We will be back.",2011-04-03 05:55:21

i6wDz6V-vQ1MTbJgkMVFGQ,xH63knKaVhclXU2gSP1q_A,CVR3kDHXzK1fd0RAqU1Efw,4,0,0,0,"Phoenix coffee company is a very unique coffee place because this is one of those few places where they sell both coffee and tea at a good rate and with wide selection. 

I like the location of this place because it is close to where I live and I can potentially walk here, which I dont do but I can. I came here because I wanted to try out the tea places in the neighborhood. I am always looking for a place to sit and drink tea other than starbucks. Phoenix coffee might be that place only if they can prove that they have good tea. 

This is the area where they are loosing one star. The tea is good with wide range of variety but I did not find it as intense as Tazo, which is served at most Starbucks. I know every tea place is unique and I should not base my review only on one cup of tea but this is my favorite tea and if they dont have it then I will have to find something new. 

The ambiance is awesome. It has a feeling of a great little local coffee shop. What makes it unique is the variety of people who come here and sit everyday. I found so many nice friendly faces here, and they all know one another and the baristas too. There are musicians, old people, students, people with a lot of tattoos and piercings etc. 

I think I am going to be a regular here because I need to find my favorite tea in this place.",2011-09-05 23:43:00

Called the A/C guy who couldnt come for another 2 hours or so, so I pulled on some pants and raced down to Lowe's.  

I frantically flew into the store and was surprisingly greeted by someone who actually knew where the AC filters were.  Since mine hadnt been changed in a good 6 months or so (what??  I'm a girl I dont know these useless things), I figured a new filter was the place to start.  I found the filter right where the greeter said it would be, and raced to the checkout.

No line!  NO LINE!!!  And someone actually pleasant to help me.  What is this place called?!  NOT Home Depot, thats for sure!  The check out guy, Sam, reassured me that AC was actually pretty easily fixed and that it probably just needed freeon (frion? free-on? frie-ohn?) but that yes, I had picked out a great set of filters.

I think it's always busy at Sugar Bowl so it was a bit of a wait to get our ice-cream but we didn't mind. When the banana split was delivered to us, we saw that the portion size was absolutely massive! Unfortunately, even though it looked great, it left a lot to be desired. We didn't find anything special about their ice-cream; it tasted like what freezer section store ice-cream and the strawberries & marshmallow sauce didn't really enhance anything.

The menu was reinvented this year, and you will find appetizers such as Rock Shrimp Spring Rolls, incredible Teriyaki Ribs, Seared Ahi Sliders, and a plethora of Tempura selections.  In addition, the restaurant offers Yakisoba, Ramen, Teppanyaki, and Specialty Maki.
Maki of Note: Foku (bacon, salmon, cream cheese, scallions, and crispy onions topped with baked spicy crab) Gaijin (spicy tuna, spicy crab, avocado, cream cheese wrapped with a flour tortilla and then deep friend and topped with a chipotle cream sauce) Harajuku Lover (shredded chicken breast, avocado, cucumber topped with spicy teriyaki sauce and pineapple sauce)

Although they have an extensive menu, I consider this strictly a watering hole, especially during their happy hour.

Happy hour is daily from 4p-7p, and all speciality drinks are 1/2 off, as well as all appetziers, sake bombers, wines, and sake infusions.

The specialty drinks are a liquid dreams.

My favorite is the ""Hello Kitty"" which is strawberry infused sake and Japanese strawberry soda, mixed with vodka.   Runner up is the ""Katori Kick,"" pineapple infused sho-chu, zen green tea liqueur, and fresh lime juice.  For a lighter cocktail, try the ""Harajuku Lover,. which is a pearl plum vodka and sparkling sake.

The karaoke rooms are small, but the large one comfortably seats nearly twenty people.  If you can get that many people together for a room, the $150 per hour cost is not so bad.  We had a fantastic time in there, and were complete clowns.  We had designated wait staff, so no one had to leave the room in order to get drinks.  (If you show up during happy hour, the karaoke rooms are half price, as well)

Busiest nights are Fridays-Sundays.  Sundays are industry night, and all sushi rolls and appetizers are half off, as well as every drink in the house.

If you want a peaceful and quiet dinner, this is not the place to come. Expect it loud and rockin.' If you are here late night, forget about finding a place to sit.

If you want an incredible experience with a toilet, luxuriate on one of their heated toilets, complete with remote control panel where you can rinse and dry your bottom, down to controling the water temperature and air pressure.

Best for grabbing a late-night bite when you're in the mood for Japanese (sushi and otherwise) or Malaysian.  Quality of the food is prime when it isn't super-crowded and presumably the chefs aren't overwhelmed or rushed.

NOTABLY TASTY:
Curry seafood fried rice, XO sauce bay scallop fried rice, tonkatsu ramen, Ocean roll, tempura/deep-fried ice cream

THE GOOD:
Malaysian food is hard to come by, in Cleveland, Los Angeles, and everywhere in between, so props to having one in CLE!  The sushi is pretty good as well--a little loosely packed but decent.  Offers probably the closest Clevelanders will get to decent ramen, though it's still far from a somewhat standard Japanese rendition.  Carries a solid selection of the usual Japanese lagers.  Great for low-key meetups--ambiance is a cross between a late-night diner and 24-hour Korean tofu/BBQ house.

THE BAD:
 The way I haunt Pac East, you'd never think I'd be so consistently disappointed...but I am.  It's completely ridiculous.  As if I'd be more impressed if I went back more often.  Like trying your luck at the slot machines.  But with worse odds than most slot machines.  Complexity of flavors vary widely and seem to decrease when the house is packed.  Pac East is famed for its sushi in the Cleveland Asian immigrant community but honestly, I've had sushi/sashimi in Cleveland and Oberlin that surpasses Pac East in freshness, taste and texture.  As for the Malaysian food, aside from the novelty and rarity of it being Malaysian food, there's nothing stunning or spectacular to report.  Growing up visiting family and (more importantly) all the countless street food stands/hawker centers in Singapore, I know my standards will be higher than the average Asian cuisine lover when it comes to Malaysian/Singaporean food, but even if they weren't, there's a definite missing element--whether umami or imaginative pairing of textures--to most of their dishes.  

THE VERDICT:
If you haven't been, Pac East is worth a try.  You might land something delicious.  And the worst that can happen?  You might land something mediocre.",2013-05-17 13:31:56

It comes with a couple of tortillas (flour or corn).  I tried the salsa and spicy avocado from their salsa bar, neither was great but both edible.  I have had better Horchata but again it was ok.

Our wait gave us time to peruse the grocery store section - the shelves were filled with a plethora of goodies; olive oils, chocolates, gourmet pastas, preserves.... made me wish I was a better cook!

We loved the restaurant with its open kitchen, high ceiling and bright airy feel. The little decor details, fall flowers and mini pumpkins, were a nice touch. 

We were seated at the communal tables - you have just enough space to eat comfortably and its great if you enjoy a little eavesdropping like I do!

Menu isn't extensive but well thought out - there's bound to be a choice for you whether you're feeling ""sucré, salé or santé""

Their specials (all about $15) come with coffee and juice (or a mimosa for a little extra!)

Rather than bread, they brought us a few pieces of apple cake to start - delicious and a nice detail.

Especially ARIA, given how far they are from just about everything else.  However, it looks like I wasn't the only one that wondered about that because helllooooo Five50 Pizza!

Located next to the sportsbook (taking over the old sports grill), Five50 is a trendy pizza joint with both a regular dining room and a to-go counter to get pizzas by the slice.  Both are open relatively late, though maybe not late enough for the post-clubbing crowd (the restaurant closes at midnight, the counter at 2:00am).  Still, they're great for midnight cravings, or people on the go like me.

Of the four types offered, I ordered the GOTHAM since it was simply my kind of pizza - Sausage, Pepperoni, Salami, Mozzarella, and Grana Podano.  Each bite was full of unhealthy, meaty goodness and I liked how the crust was thin, but not soggy.  At the same time, the flavors aren't exactly unique.  I've had others in the past that had more creative and compelling flavors, which brings me to the next point...

...that as much as I liked the pizza, I'd rather spend the money on something I can't get elsewhere.  Yes, it's the Strip, but $6.50 a slice is nothing to scoff at (thank goodness for resort credit!).  Just getting a single slice might not be that bad, but it can get pricey if you're hungry.

They're different than the traditional donut, which are thicker, and maybe that's why I like them because they're thinner and not so bready. That way they are never dry and nice and moist, full of flavor. The traditional ones are hit and miss with the dryness factor, and I still like them if they're not dry.

The more independently owned the better, so that you don't need to deal with the vanilla-flavoured experience that a chain restaurant provides.  The sad part is that being in Toronto, and me being a Senators fan, you can pretty much guarantee that every independent sports bar in Toronto is going to be Leafs crazy.  So be it.

Shakey's is a quintessential sports bar for Toronto.  As you'd expect, Leafs shirts and other memorabilia line the walls of this Bloor Street West pub.  This is the type of place that you'd expect regulars that play on baseball, hockey, and soccer teams to come in after their respective games.  And they do.  In droves.  Because of the intense sporting atmosphere, this is one of the places where you would want to watch one of the big games whichever it may be.

The beers on tap are numerous, and the menu is as typical and as good as you would expect in a sports bar of this stature.  The wings come off especially good in this place with a suicide sauce that is hot and tasty and not hot-for-hot's-sake.  Sad to say that I like this place even as a Sens fan.

We were all extremely satisfied with the service, food, ambience, and everything that the restaurant offered. First, we were sat right in front of the chef. So we were able to have a conversation with him and see what he was doing. The foods were all amazing! Honestly this was the best meal from our Montreal trip (all 4 of us agreed).

This was a true lesson in ""not judging a book by its cover"".  When we pulled up into the sketchy parking lot of Island Style, my husband had some hesitation and suggested we go somewhere else.  But, I told him that people I trusted on Yelp recommended it- so let's just take a look.  Well, when we opened the door- we were welcomed by the owner, Russell like we were ""ohana""- and the place was pretty packed with Korean, Filipino, and Hawaiian diners. 

I am so glad we stepped inside because it truly reminded me of my favorite family owned restaurants in Hawaii! I ordered the combo plate and instantly fell in love with the Meat Jun.  It was my first time trying it, and it will definitely not be my last.  My husband ordered the Stone-Pot Bimimbap and said it was the best he has ever had.  We also ordered a couple Spam Musubi because I can't eat hawaiian food without having some good ol' spam, and the seaweed wrapper was perfectly crunchy. Throw in some delicious good sized plates of banchan- and we were a happy bunch.  If I didn't show some restraint, I would have filled up completely on the kimchi (which is homemade by his wife). 

Russell's friendly hospitality was awesome. He even offered to change the TV channel to some cartoons for our toddler- but I told him to leave it on Jeopardy because if she is watching TV, she won't eat. We chatted a bit, and he told us that his wife runs the Island Style at Greenland Market.  Well, the next day- we actually made a trip down to Greenland- and my husband ordered a plate of Meat Jun just for himself this time and loved every bite!",2011-05-03 21:18:01

Ordered Chaplee Kabob Dinner (spicy ground beef) that came with rice - $9.49 and Wazeri Kabob (1 chicken, 1 kofta) - $9.69.  Both came with 2 kinds of salad and fresh naan (2pcs)!  Yum.

Although it doesn't look appetising in the pic, the Chaplee was more of a squashed burger patty than kabob.  Everything was grilled/spiced well and not dry or over-done.  The tomato-based salad reminded me of a pico de gallo.  And the sauce that came with both dishes was like a spicy, fresher, slightly more citrusy salsa.  I don't know what spices/herbs they used, but I would love to know!

We also tried the Dough, a yogurt-based drink, but it reminded me of a watery tzatziki/salty lassi (yuck!) with diced cucumber floating on top.  Personally, not something that I'd want to drink.  I prefer my drinks sweet as opposed to savoury.

One employee shrugged her shoulders, another said ""that's the way it is"", and a third said I'd just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Don't call it a vegetarian burrito if it isn't vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   It's especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more ""traditional"" Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.

Grilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted, not lukewarm, but cold.  Tortilla wasn't the slightest bit warm either, just as if it was served raw.  So there's this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside, and then the grilled veggies.  

Tables receive salsa which is nice, the hot is really more of a medium, but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  You're going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes, and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.

Atmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls, and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.

Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian, or gringo if you prefer, and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here, maybe not.

On a positive note, the employees did check on tables as folks were dining, and were over the top with politeness.   That's incredibly rare these days.",2011-05-14 02:13:54

The set up is pretty cool.  Kinda cozy, kinda industrial.  A little darker than I like, especially where the pastries are since you can barely see them..  Which is why I asked the guy what they were and turned out they were actually 3 items spread out over 6 display risers.  A little sign or something to hint at what these items were would definitely help the ordering process.  Especially if the worker missed the delivery and had no idea what was in them..  

So we order 2 black coffees and turns out they didn't have enough to fill the tiny tiny cups for both so they say it'll take a few minutes while they brew it I guess manually?  They have the Aeropress (which is what we use at home), and various sized drip contraptions which I'm assuming they went with to make our coffee.  

The coffee was a bit sour, which happens when the coffee is under brewed.  We do it ourselves at home once in a while, but we're not paying 2.50 per Dixie cup.

We ordered the 2 lb combo which was two pounds of wings (enough for 2), a large fry, soda and one dipping sauce. We chose parmesan garlic and spicy buffalo for our flavor and blue cheese for the dipping sauce. 

One thing I didn't care for was the extra charge for dipping sauces. They are $1.79 for a medium and $3.99 for a large. The combo came with a very small sauce, enough for about 2 wings. We arrived about 20 minutes later and the order wasn't ready. Suki (the owner) is such a nice lady and so proud of her wings. 

I had to wait about 10 minutes and they were ready. The wings themselves were excellent. Big, plump, juicy and steaming hot. The parmesan garlic were our favorite.

I took a bite of the omelette, the ramp pesto stung my tongue with oxidized garlic, it was very strong and very fresh. The toast had a weird flavor, perhaps a seed I am not familiar with or it tasted like mold? I am not so sure. My handsome hunk of a husband had an omelette as well. He ordered the avocado, apple bacon, jalepeno muenster omelette topped with fresh salsa. His omelette was served with deep fried home fries. His omelette was also massive and mouth watering.

It has 2 bars open. On the side of the room they have White couches you can lounge on. About 4 tables in the middle of room, the washrooms located beside the stage. If you're slick you can catch the band coming in the hallway on your way to the washroom because its right beside the stage entrance. When i went to the washroom you kind of have go down the stairs and go through a hallway filled with virgin mobile ads. the washrooms were not so clean, it seemed as though it hasn't been looked after a couple of days. The drinks were averagely priced, No surprise there. 

I think that Virgin mobile needs to make some improvements as to the ATM machines also, they had 2 ATM machines but neither of them worked. Really? My bro had to go outside to the plaza in front to find one. The workers here were nice, except for the bouncers they were somewhat rude and sarcastic, but whatever seemed to be stuck up their ass seemed to be really umm...stuck up there. The venue itself i have no problem with and if those little improvements were made by Virgin mobile. Then all for the better. That wont stop me from coming back, because The mod club is in fact a one of the stamps of Toronto. More Improvements, less Virgin mobile ads.",2013-11-28 18:38:29

My husband and I made our first stop of wedding florist hunting here.  As we were driving up, I had very low expectations as it is in a fairly ghetto area of Gilbert and the small area it was located in was not looking promising with all the paint decorated windows.

Inside the store, it is fairly tacky, but that is to be expected with all the silly gifts and balloons and what nots.  The true beauty of this place is definitely among the flowers.  All of their florals are extremely fresh and beautiful with bold vibrant colors everywhere.  I even caught a glimpse of my favorite flower (bird of paradise) inside their large refrigerated glass display case in the center.  Things were looking promising.

Our appointment was with Elizabeth, a very friendly and attentive woman.  She brought out a few wedding books for us to flip through as we (me) described what the flowers should look like.  I wasn't finding anything I liked in the books, but I was able to piece a few pictures together to explain what I wanted.  I wanted a tropical arrangement in the middle of summer with birds of paradise as the focal points.  Elizabeth told me that what I wanted was pretty uncommon in terms of weddings and really difficult to do.  However, she said she couldn't be more excited to do my flowers.  She loves to do tropicals and she loves a challenge.  This was definitely the woman for the job.

My mom picked up the flowers the day of the wedding and brought them home just as I was finishing getting ready.  When I saw them (beware this is corny) I nearly cried because they were so beautiful and they were even better than I could have dreamed.

For about 500 dollars we got an incredibly large bouquet for me, a small bouquet for my maid of honor, a small bouquet to toss, a corsage for my gma, 4 boutonnieres for the men, and 10 beautiful centerpieces for the table.  I found that to be an unbeatable deal considering I picked one of the more expensive flowers, the difficulty in the arrangements, and the quality of service.  I cannot express how happy I was to have Elizabeth do my flowers.  I recommend her to anyone and everyone that needs flowers for any occasion.",2009-04-24 14:31:21

PlayLV gaming did a good job of hiring pleasant dealers, but they need to upgrade the cocktail girls.    I wasn't too happy with them, but there still learning the curve so I'm letting them off the hook on this visit.

As far as table games, the usual blackjack, craps, liberal 21, roulette, and I'm not sure on Pai Gow, but it could be there.

The sportsbook didn't change much, but Lucky sportsbook usually have pretty good odds. 

The catch to this casino will be it restaurants which are opened.   One of them is Hash House a GoGo, and the other is a Las Vegas Hawaiian favorite, Island Sushi and deli; both of these restaurants have a very good following with the local crowd in Las Vegas, and if they serve the same amount of food as the other locations....this casino doesn't need a buffet, but extra take out boxes.    Hash house is known for  huge size plates, and and Island Sushi is known for that too.  I have a feeling the guest over at California Hotel will make their way to this Hotel for late night bentos.      There is a Subway in operation next the lobby, but that's just subway.

The Plaza purchased room furniture from Fountainblu.

- Quite a good size for medium 
- Broth is hot and steamy.. perfect for the cold weather. taste wise it is A-OK 
- Noodles is the dried package type... not too badly cook.. does not have that funny taste 
- Raw Beef is really not raw... like really cook and tough, chewy and dry 

Spring Rolls ($3.75) 
- I almost want to laugh when they said their spring rolls are ""The Most Famous Spring Rolls!"" 
- The oil they were deep fried in were stale that's why they turns out to be brownish instead of golden in colour 
- The wrapping they use for the spring rolls are the Vietnamese type but the Chinese type... hmmmm 

Most of the waitstaffs here are Mandarin speaking Chinese... Efficient, Fast and Get the Job Done... Standard in most of the Chinese restaurant. 

The menu here is not totally Vietnamese food, there are quite a bit of Cantonese fare too...

The sushi is yummy and also half off, so you are paying about $8-9 for large specialty rolls. The sushi quality is above average for what I've seen in Vegas, so this is a great deal.

Just like any other keg, it was packed, and we waited almost 45 mins to be seated. The area was very dim and it sets the mood for a romantic night out. 

 I opted for my favorite filet mignon and ordered a Forbidden Fruit martini. The drink was really good; I especially liked the strawberry rock crystals along the rim on the drink. I would recommend this drink for girls, even those who do not regularly drink alcohol because the taste of vodka is barely there. 

Onto the filet mignon. I asked for medium rare, but when it came, it was more on the rare side. What's special about the steak was that it was wrapped by a piece of bacon. However, I prefer the steak on its own. The taste of the bacon took over, so halfway through the meal, I separated the two. The steak on its own was very juicy and soft. 

Just a tip - the roasted garlic mashed potato side is MASSIVE. Compared to the twice baked potato, the portion is almost double the size! So.. finish your steak before your side.

I'm very happy we decided to eat dinner here and don't know why those poor reviews exist.  The service was truly excellent and the food was certainly very good.  My wife had the open face hot turkey sandwich.  She said it was very good; the gravy was excellent.  I had the liver and onions.  Most places don't offer that, and I love it if done well, so I tried it.  The liver (all 3/4 lb of it) was cooked perfectly - done but not dry. There was a prodigious amount of sauteed onions atop the liver, again cooked perfectly with still some body to them.  The steamed vegetables were done correctly - slightly al dente.  The mashed potatoes were good, as was the mushroom gravy.  The only thing that would have made the liver better was if it were fried in bacon drippings instead of oil.  But, the two full slices of bacon on top were certainly sufficient.  During our two years of travel throughout the United States, we have discovered numerous restaurants that use far too much salt.  It was refreshing to find that I actually had to add just a little bit of salt to my dishes.  In all, this was quite the enjoyable dinner - and the prices are excellent.

As I continue to frequent this place, the customer service is increasingly erratic and the food less fresh. I can't even describe how one of the women tried to get the bottom of the brew into my cup and then when not full, starting taking drips from a fresh pot being brewed and adding it to my cup. By the time she finished, I had lost my appetite for the cup she prepared. Ew! I have to downgrade my original rating because of too many disappointing visits. It's a shame as it is not well managed and customer service training clearly lacking.

Earlier review: Adorable local coffee shop with an interesting array of local art on the wall. You'll know you've arrived when you spot the Ducati bike outside. I usually just get their coffee, which is always great, but they do serve lunch and breakfast, especially muffins and pastries.

The menu is large and they have a selection of savory and sweet options, as well as breakfast & lunch items. For sweet, I like to get a short stack of pancakes with a fun topping (apples & cream = amazing!). Otherwise, omelettes are always a solid choice for a savory option. Never had a bad meal here!

A hefty hunk of meat nestled in a brioche bun with melted cheddar and a cross-hatch of semi-crisp bacon. Accouterments included the requisite lettuce, tomato, and thin-sliced pickles (which I think really give burgers that extra layer of flavour). I asked for medium-rare and got just that. The side of fries were fab: hand-cut and lightly seasoned. The Oengus Irish Stout (Nitro, starts at $1.40 for 4 ounces) was a no. It tasted like dirty water with a hint of coffee in the postlude. The brown ale might have been better if you enjoy dark & bitter with a bit more complexity. Our waiter was a maybe. He was courteous and lovely and kept our water glasses filled. He claimed he has a good memory but forgot my beer along with that of my companion's. And his rave recommendation of the Oengus Irish Stout seemed like false advertising.

I don't want to bash on this restaurant since it's locally owned, but there was nothing 4.5 star about this restaurant.  We had wanted to like this place; it was actually one of my bookmarks!  However, the other negative reviews about this restaurant resonate how I feel.  

Our table had the calamari and chorizos as the appetizers.  They were neither spectacular or fantastic.  They were just ok... 

For our entrees, we had the paella ($29), bacalhau ($25), seafood pasta (~$22?) and the butter fish (it was the special; not sure how much it was).  The paella and the butter fish were probably the best dishes, relatively speaking.  The shredded bacalhau was, no offense, basically cat food.  

And I know what you're thinking, who would order seafood pasta at a Portuguese restaurant???  Well, I was told by Ruby, one of the owners, that their ""homemade village sauce"" is spectacular and a must-try.  So, we ordered the seafood pasta.  It was like tomato cream sauce tainted by some unidentifiable ingredients...  

The pasta was actually cold when it arrived at our table.  We had to send it back so they can microwave it to warm it up...  

All in all, the food was sub-par and the service was slow (due to the fact ""it's cooked fresh"").  They had a live jazz band when we were there.  While that usually means a fun time, it was simply too loud at such a small venue.  We couldn't hear ourselves think!  So, it is questionable that they have a 4.5 star rating.  It's also questionable rather this is authentic Portuguese food.  That shall remain to be a question since, I'm sorry to say, we won't be coming back...",2015-10-12 03:56:04

In Robinson, a stronghold of the chain experience, Settlers Ridge acts as an altar of avarice and corporate, suburban vapidity.

Among them are Giant Eagle, PF Chang's (look, I'm not going, aight?), Omaha Steaks (this is not a joke and is unfortunate), Dairy Queen, Five Below, Barnes & Noble, Shoe Carnival, and I'll stop to prevent nausea on the part of my readers.

We went in and I think it might be the owner/manager? was super friendly and seated us. We had our first dish within minutes and our drinks even sooner. Service was really friendly - they even came by and asked us if the food was okay which is something I've only seen western places do. I was taken by surprise and I wasn't sure if I heard right and my parents didn't even realize that she had asked. My brother drinks a lot of water - when we asked for a refill the waitress came by, poured him water and then set the whole bottle down for our convenience (and hers too probably). She could have just set the bottle down but she poured it for him anyway.

We got ready to pay and she must have seen our 50 dollar bill - to be fair it's hard to miss. Before we even flagged someone down she'd given us our change and receipt and we just gave her the $50. Her math was right too. I was impressed at how efficient that was and according to my parents it's just how it is in Hong Kong because of the high turnover of tables. The restaurant today was half full. Best service I've ever had at an HK style cafe.

However, the food today wasn't as good - they changed their recipe for the baked pork chop rice with tomato sauce it seems. While before it leaned more sweet, now it's more on the sour side. Too sour and not even rice, tons of sauce - even if they gave half a bowl more in the dish there would have been enough. We ordered extra rice and then it was too much. And there was a whole piece of fat that had been fried along with the actual meat. Some people are into it, but I'm not. Note that adding cheese or a fried egg costs an extra dollar. Some places (like Phoenix) do this but at other places dishes come with cheese already.

Same with the chicken with Portuguese sauce - not enough rice, too much of everything else. Fried noodles with beef were great today though.

First, insert viral YouTube video of the woman peeling the avocado because almost all the salads and sandwiches have this wonderful superfood.

So...Health freak? Check. Nuts (WALNUTS!!!), fruit (TANGERINES!!!), avocado (YES!!!!), cheese, root vegetables (BEETS!!!) are all possible toppings on the set salad you can choose. There's around 15 salad options available, so really the problem won't be finding something to eat... it'll be deciding what to eat.

Each sandwich comes with a little pickled carrot salad (heads up, they look like beets because they're red!) It's not that tasty, but I would say it's comparable to the pink ginger you get with sushi... a Palette cleanser. 

I had two things - the Chicken Avocado sandwich and the Porridge.

The Chicken Avocado sandwich was pretty standard. The bread was toasted to perfection (thin, soft, and crispy on the edges). The chicken was a bit bland and dry... not a fan. The avocado was ripe and the rest of the filling was super fresh.

The porridge on the other hand... was absolutely amazing. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and had walnuts and fruits which elevated the flavours of the dish. The portion sizes they gave could honestly feed around three people, and it was only a little over $6+. Not bad!

My friends had the breakfast crepe. They found the crepe to be extremely delicious, but was filled with far too much cottage cheese.

Overall, do come to Cafe Veritas if you are a lover of all things healthy. Don't come here if you are looking for a REAL Quebecois cafe though. Don't be fooled (ironically) by the name - it's not authentic. Nonetheless, it's still fairly good.",2016-05-24 17:57:37

The restaurant is spacious, and clean.
The staff was helpful.
Good size of selections.

Things that I didn't like:
The udon was over cooked; they were a bite soggy.
Tempura were greasy/oily.
There was a trash can in the middle of the hallway on the way to the restroom.

I also had their famous lemonade, it was a decent but different cup of lemonade, it almost felt like creamy lemonade.

This is my first time trying this place and I ordered it through a 40% off tasteaway promo code.

Estimate delivery time was a conservative 90 minutes and I got the food in about 70 minutes. They are on Avenue south of Wilson and I am at Yonge and Sheppard.

When I received the order, everything was provided: chopsticks, forks, sauces, napkins, crushed peanuts, and takeout menu with promo codes.

Without ever having been in one of their locations, I wasn't totally sure what to expect but hopefully it would be decent Thai food.

The salad roll I ordered was the worst I ever had. The ingredients inside the roll were fresh and had a decent presentation within the delivery box with a slice of orange and some slices of fresh mango. The rolls were sliced into 6 pieces and presented like sushi.  I'm glad they did this because the rice wrap was hard like plastic.  I ate a couple of pieces with the wrap and then gave up.  I emptied out the contents and threw out the ""plastic rings"". I was basically left with a mango salad which is what I should have ordered in the first place.

The pad thai with chicken and shrimp was average but still hot in temperature. I really had no issues with it and there was a decent amount of chicken, tofu and shrimp.

The chicken devil was also still hot in temperature but again, just average. It is quite spicy but nothing too hot.  There are chili peppers mixed within so if you choose to eat them, it would make the chicken spicier. I also made my own rice at home to eat with this.

Despite this review, there's certainly a chance I may try this place again... especially if tasteaway has another 40% off promo code.  I just won't order the salad roll. I probably wouldn't bother to dine-in either.  Delivery suits me just fine.",2014-05-16 14:56:27

With a handful of tables and booths inside (capacity @ 34 people) and another handful of tables on their outside patio, it's a cozy little cafe-like spot. 

I am not an expert when it comes to Indian food, but it does seem like their menu is limited.  There's no dahl/daal, Gobi Manchurian, Aloo Gobi, Aloo Saag, or Masala dishes.  Instead, there is an abundance of puri/roti and Aloo Curry dishes. I also noticed that naan was missing from their menu. Maybe they have it upon request? I'll be sure to ask upon my next visit and will report back accordingly.

I ordered the Samosas and the Vada Pav.  The Samosa dish comes with 2 whole potato-filled samosas, which were fried to a perfectly flaky golden crisp.  I opted for tamarind sauce instead of the mint sauce. 

The Vada Pav came with 2 spicy potato patties on buns (think sliders), garnished with a garlic red chili sauce.  They were delicious, although the buns were very cold and wet/mushy on the bottom. I didn't understand the cause for this, unless the buns were initially frozen... I'm not sure, but aside from that the dish was very good and I would order it again. 

They are a vegetarian restaurant but over 1/2 of the menu is vegan or can be made vegan. Vegan options are marked with a 'V' on the board menu and the printed menu. They do not serve eggs; the non-vegan dishes contain dairy (yogurt or cottage cheese). They do have few gluten-free options marked on the menu as well.  

They have a case with pre-packaged deserts, some of which are vegan, but not labeled as such, so be sure to ask. The prices seem decent, to me, at least for what I ordered. 

I spoke with the owner and inquired about the selection of dishes.  She indicated that since they were so new, she wanted to see how the current dishes sell.  They could possibly expand or modify their selection at a later time.

They are barely a month old, so I know that they have kinks to work out.  I received friendly service and good food; as a vegan, I will definitely continue to patronize them in hopes that they will improve over time.

You'll see that they take their motto seriously and they go to great lengths to reach customer satisfaction. To reinforce this great concept, they hire extremely helpful and courteous staff.

I loved everything about it. There are many pet stores around the Las Vegas area. Big names like Petsmart and Petco, but this is to comparison of Target to Walmart... Love the feel you get when you enter Target, but even though Walmart is a great store.. it just doesn't have that cozy home feeling as Target. That's how I feel with this boutique versus other big stores.. even though all are equally wonderful. 

I took my Birthday boy shopping here after self washing and grooming him there. Even got his nails trimmed, which I was very proud, because seconds later, the nice groomer came out with a smile of relief and said your dog was the most relaxed pet we had today... He was so good about getting his nails trimmed, he literally gave me his paw!!! I looked at Ruffin and said.. is that riiiiiight?! Omgoodness always so happy! I love it!!! Time to shop for goodies! Best of both worlds if you ask me. Kathy Patterson, the owner assisted me with any questions or help I needed in getting the most out of my trip here. It's a drive for me, But well worth it if it makes my dog Happy and Healthy!

She educated me on different dog foods to consider, since he's becoming an old man now :( Can't believe how much time has passed and the dog years that suddenly added up! She gave me two dog food samples to try: Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Precise Holistic Complete, which are both above-average dog food that consists of the simplest ingredients: meats, vegetable, fruits, and whole grains. She told me you'll see a huge difference in their fur, eyes, gums, and overall health. Chicken Soup brand use natural preservatives.. the meats are hormone and antibiotic free!!! When I let my dogs try both brands.. they devoured it like it was human food!!! Didn't even have that strong odor you get from the common dry dog foods. They even ate it like it was a treat, instead of their daily food to eat. The two samples lasted a good week and it was great to see a huge difference in the appetite and excitement of my dogs trying these. 

I also found some delicious sweet potato treats for dogs, which supports healthy skin and eyes as well as a healthy coat. It is full of starch, so weight gain is a possibility. Everything in moderation!!! Also bought pumpkin treats that resemble honey comb cereal. From their own bakery, I bought a Banana muffin and Carrot Crunchies that had w/ sweet potato in them!!! Yum right??!?!! Even I wanted to take a bite myself!!! I spotted a cute soft furry stuffed animal and it was currently the most popular toy at the boutique, since there was only one left called the Salsa Monster. My dog still takes it everywhere around the house, even outside!! But I have to tell him to drop the toy if he wants to play outdoors. It also makes a squeaky noise, which Ruffin is very fond of.. especially when he is excited... he'll make it known how thrilled he is. 

You can seriously get lost in all the goodies they have and explore healthier choices in dog food, which I never knew you could get. Kathy was very kind and helpful in showing me around and helping choose what would be best for adult dogs in nutrition. I appreciate her knowledge and letting me know what is available for my dogs. They have many accessories also and I was eyeing this unique blanket that can be inverted to a furry eskimo house!!! I thought it was the cutest thing ever :D 

If you're looking for a place to wash your furry pet and at the same time shop for dog food, treats, and accessories... Well look no further! Barking Dogs has everything you need and a helpful staff to assist you. Definitely will make a trip back to do some holiday shopping!!!",2011-12-12 04:53:10

I wanted to make sure my 50th review was something special, and I am happy that the honor is going to the glorious Honey Pig. I have been eating as close to a vegan diet as possible since September, so you might wonder how exactly you can trust my opinion on Korean BBQ. Well, I have not been feeling so well, so I decided maybe I just needed a big dose of protein. Nowhere delivers a big does of protein quite as effectively as Korean BBQ.

Plus, back in my omnivore days, the Honey Pig was my go-to joint for the meaty feast of galbi. I have had more than one late night of too much soju and meat at the Pig. The flavor was the best, the sides were the tastiest and we adored the server. Plus, they have cute dome shaped grills, not the flat style that you see at 99% of the BBQ places. I honestly missed the place. 

Last night we returned. I was especially motivated after seeing Jae G's post regarding all you can eat; this is a new offering. For $20, you can have all you can eat galbi! The flavor was as tasty as ever, and our favorite server was there to welcome our return. Honestly, the sides (banchan) were not up to par, but they did have a new daikon soup that was amazing.

One was the kbbq duck & pork style, which was cooked in their korean spicy sauce which was very flavorful. The meat was tender too. They served radish for you to wrap the meat, along with the cabbage and onions in soy sauce all together. Tasty!

The other group set was the chicken soup. The set comes with 2 full chickens. The soup was cooked with just the chicken and a few green onions and rice cakes so it was not that flavorful and slightly bland but had a clean taste to it. After 2 servings of the full chicken, the staff came back to make the porridge, which was adding purple rice mixing it into the leftover soup. The porridge was really flavorful, with all the soup soaked in.

We also ordered the smoked duck which was really good. It was a huge platter filled with pieces of smoked duck, you then grill the smoked duck on the bbq grill. The idea is to use the radish to wrap the duck and cabbage and onions in soy sauce all together.

We came in for all you can eat sushi that a coworker recommended to us. 

I'm not trying to say that restaurants should not charge for waste for AYCE. But I think it is necessary to remind/mention for the waste charge. At the end, we have some left on the plate and they told us the waste charge is $1 for a piece left on the plate. Our waitress didn't mention anything about it even after she told us,""there is no chance that you guys will leave here hungry""! Take one star off from there. At the end, they charged us $15 for the leftover and let us to bring them home. We definitely overestimated ourselves but there comes to my second point. Old ingredients!

All the sashimi didn't taste fresh, tuna look brown! Shrimp were cut into slices(never had shrimp like that, it look like either pressed or just slice one shrimp into 2-3pieces shrimp), eel was old/over cooked and the best of all of them was salmon which is just like 5 out of 10 grade. Ordered some gyoza and they were fine, hard to mess up with that. It just they served it warm not hot. Make me wonder if they microwaved it then fry it for a minute. I've made gyoza at home or other restaurants and I remember them being a little bit warmer than that. Fried dumplings, my husband spit it out after one bite! 

Sushi! Here is the what came here for. They are not bad I have to admit. But not outstanding either. Looking at how old are their sashimi, it's hard to make me believe that the sushi are fresh. 

At the end, I understand they want to close on time so everybody who work there can go home. But, is it really necessary to clean to floor by our table while we are still eating? Ah, I forgot to mention the beer was flat as well.

That evaporated once they brought the food, and we were faced with astronomical portion sizes that would feed us for a second (and in my case third) meal.

We started with the hummus that was free with Yelp check-in:  beautifully presented, along with a basket of warm, puffed pita straight from the oven, and adorned with multiple slices of Persian cucumber.  That's helpful for limiting the amount of bread you need to eat.  Cukes are great for dipping into hummus, and the hummus is made of a combination of fava beans and chickpeas, very authentic.

For our main courses, hubby ordered the chicken kebab, and I decided on something I don't usually order, baked kibbe.  We both had salad for our side dishes, and were served with large bowls with mixed greens, onion, tomatoes, and more of those yummy Persian cukes.  I had my dressing on the side, and it was an unusual mix of oil, lemon, salt, pepper, and mint.  I was so full from the hummus, half a piece of pita, and the salad that I could have stopped there.  But I didn't.

When the plates were brought out, I thought I would faint from the amount of food.  The kebabs had three skewers of chicken, each chock-full of meat, with a spicy-ish sauce basted on top, sitting on enough Lebanese rice to feed a family of four.  I tried the chicken, and it was the best chicken kebab ever.

The star of the presentation was my kibbe.  When I had it at other restaurants years ago, it was always a square of re-warmed stuff cut out of a larger baking dish.  That's probably why I stopped ordering it.  My dish here had three individual gigundo balls of fresh kibbe, surrounding a center of meat, seasonings, and pine nuts, sitting atop an atomic-sized portion of the aforementioned rice, along with a roasted tomato.  Totally different from what I was expecting, and incredibly good.  I had to force myself to finish just one of those balls.

Service was exceptional from Alida, the owner's sister, and the young woman, also family, whose name I didn't get.  The TVs did NOT have sports playing - YAY!!, and the background music was terrific.

My only issue and reason for knocking off 1 star is that it's wayyyyy overpriced.  I just did not feel the value for the money was there. I believe It's around $18-$25 for most of the entree plates. I understand pierogis are labor intensive to make but that is just crazy for something made from dirt cheap ingredients - flour, potato, and onion. $20+ per plate is what you would pay for salmon or steak at some restaurants. For that reason I probably won't be back. For two small cups of borscht soup, 2 beers and 2 entree plates our total for dinner was $76.

The Fish Store sells fish apparently, but honestly it is just a no frills and run-down sandwich shop (which looks more like a kiosk). They offer all the usual types of fish like salmon, sole, haddock, grouper and so on as sandwiches and also have options like soup, taco or salad. The advantage here is that they have the fish on ice at the shop and pick and prepare it on order as opposed to ripping open an industrial package.

They typically have a 'special' of the week, but there is nothing special about it as the price is the same as always and every other fish and does not come with any extras. I assume it is a 'special' because the owner wants to sell it for reasons of stock or profitability. They offer an avocado cut and sliced at $1.25 extra as a side.
The sandwiches are typically delicious and are $10 each and could be had in a bun or as a wrap. The owner is Chinese so only accepts cash.

I still enjoyed the water-boiled soup dishes, but it was not spicy at all the last time I tried it. The taste was still there... but I didn't sweat like a pig this time.

During the last meal, we arrived at 7:30 PM on a Monday. It's not busy. The wait service was tardy. 

Service has gone downhill a bit. The dimwitted waitress was not ""listening"". I ordered 3 items clearly in her language... pot sticker, 8-treasure tofu pot, and one more. The 8-treasure tofu pot was OK... nothing exciting about the taste or consistency.

After we're almost done with the main courses, we knew something was not right. The appetizer never arrived. I was not concerned at first since it could be the last item brought to the table as expected in typical Chinese restaurant. The dimwitted one apparently only got the last 2 items. She served the pot sticker quickly though after our inquiry. My friend loved the pot stickers as dessert in this case.

I didn't feel any remorse from the staff as if this was a common occurrence and part of the service. So the service has returned to the typical Chinese style. Not a big deal. I took one star away as if they were like other Chinese restaurants. There was nothing special about this place anymore.

So diners, beware of declining service and taste from ""above standard"" to average next time when you want to invest your time and money. Maybe it is still a good bet among 300+ choices.",2010-12-07 05:07:55

But ultimately it's about the food and that's why it gets 2 stars.  Small portions, high prices and frankly, weak food with poor service are a bad combo.

The Kung Pao was unlike any I've had before.  Hard, small, dry, fried bits of chicken with some peanuts and a half pound of dried red peppers with no sauce and no veggies was somethng I'd not like to have again.  

The black bean chicken, had no veggies and the sauce was thick and gelatinous; almost slimy.  In fact it was so gelatinous, after a few minutes it actually acquired the semi-solid jiggle of actual Jello. 
It should be called corn starch chicken, not black bean chicken.

The service was uncomfortable and odd.  It was a farily dead Sunday afternoon,  yet the bartender dropped and broke three items at 3 different times while we were there.

Someone, a manager looking guy, was yelling from the kitchen to the bar (all the tables are located in between there) asking who had his Sharpie.
 
My daughter asked if she could substitute plain noodles for rice with her kids meal and the waiter just said ""No.""   Then later he mumbled some comment about ""everything being pre-portioned""

Pre-portioned?  Is this just microwave food?  A Chinese place that doesn't have any ""unpackaged"" noodles??

At $55 for 2 chicken entrees,  2 dinky kids meals and 2 iced teas with nothing else, I was robbed!

Then my biggest pet peeve- the 20 minute disappearing act after they cleared our plates and we confirmed we didn't want anything else. Meanwhile the waiter walked around looking busy and doing nothing while avoiding eye contact and not giving us our check.
 
Honestly, It just made me crave some superior Chinese fare, along the likes of Panda Express.

*The skewers are grilled over binchotan (white) charchoal. Binchotan is extra special because it burns at a lower temperature than regular charcoal but lasts longer.
*offers many other proteins and vegetarian choices as well - thus there is something for everyone here. 

-Chicken Original Soup
The chicken original soup was actually the same broth that Kinton used for their chicken ramen. Despite its simplicity, I thought the soup was a great way to start the meal as it was light and not too fatty.

-Oshinko Moriawase (assorted housemade Japanese pickles)
This was my first time having pickled burdock root and I have to say, I'm a fan! With a pleasant crunchy and meaty texture, the pickle had a distinctive sweet flavor that was similar to lotus root.

-Negima (chicken thigh & Tokyo scallion)
The grilled chunks of scallion provided a slight sweet and smoky contrast to the tender and juicy chicken thigh 

-Zuri (chicken gizzard)
 The chicken gizzard was lightly salted and well-cooked. To describe the texture of the gizzard can be quite difficult, I would say the meat had that irresistible chewy, bouncy texture yet crunchy at the same time.

-Nikumiso Kuybetsu (cabbage salad with housemade chicken miso dip)
The cabbage itself was bland, however I thought it was the perfect vessel to hold the salty chicken miso dip!

-Tebasaki (chicken wing)
 The chicken wing was done just right at Kintori Yakitory with a crispy charred skin yet still remained juicy inside.

-Uzura Kushi Age (panko breaded deep-fried quail eggs)
With each bite of the quail egg, you are getting some satisfying crunch from the panko crust. The sweet sauce complimented perfectly with the eggs and I thought this would be a nice snack to pair with beer to combat the grease.

-Premium Gyu tongue
 if you would like to try organ meats and don't know where to start, I recommend trying beef tongue! The nice thing about tongue is that it is less organish than liver. The texture is quite soft and if you really pay attention while chewing, there seems to be a slight taste that is distinctive to tongue, but I'm pretty sure if you didn't know any better you wouldn't notice it

-Tsukune (chicken meatball)
The meatballs was ""fluffy"" and juicy, and with the sweet & salty caramelized glaze, the tsukune became incredibly addicting.

-Hatsu (chicken heart)
Did you know that chicken hearts, although slightly high in cholesterol, are rich in essential B vitamins and minerals?! These were tender with a surprisingly subtle red meat taste. In texture, they're softer than you might expect, with a hint of bounciness!

-Reba (Chicken Liver)
While the salty and sweet glaze was delicious, the texture of the chicken liver was a bit strange and I was not a fan of it. The liver became powdery and foamy once it hit your tongue. 

-Asparagus (panko breaded deep-fried asparagus wrapped with bacon)
WHO DOESN""T LOVE BACON

-Negi Shio Gyu (beef with scallion sauce)
While the beef was well cooked, the star of this dish was the strong scallion sauce which provided just enough heat and sweetness to the skewer.

-Dashi Maki (Japanese omelette)
While I heard some people voiced how bland this was, I thought the dashimaki was the perfect way to end the meat-heavy courses! The omelette had a slightly sweet yet still savory flavor, and it still remained moist and soft!

-Yaki Onigiri (char-grilled rice ball with plum filling and sweet teriyaki sauce)
Since the rice ball was grilled, the onigiri had a subtle smokey flavor that only toasted rice can offer. The texture of the yaki onigiri was almost crunchy, yet chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved how there was a nice contrast between the pickled plum and sweet teriyaki sauce of the filling.

-Houji Cha Brûlée (roasted green tea crème brûlée)
Is there anyone else who get so much pleasure in cracking that caramelized sugar to get to the smooth, rich cream beneath the creme brulee? I know I do! The roasted green tea taste was quite prominent in the creme brulee at Kintori Yakitori and it was also not too sweet either - love!",2016-03-01 02:49:58

I sat at the bar for brunch. The bartender/waiter was great. We chatted about Toronto and he gave me tips about the city and things to do. Was great.

I saw ""Mrs.Longo"" on Breakfast Television one morning talking about how socially responsible the company is, their commitment to the environment by recycling plastic bags etc etc etc. The same day I go to pick up something to eat for lunch and I notice that there is no longer any biodegradable paper takeout boxes at the salad bar. Instead, there is only the molded plastic NOT RECYCLABLE takeout containers. 

I ask for the bio option, they are out of stock. I email customer service and ask why with all this commitment to environmental concerns etc, why would such a large retailer even use non-recyclable takeout containers? Then I ask if possibly the issue is customer education. Can they put a sign at the biodegradable containers? Maybe people are unaware that the other choice is not even recyclable. 

I get some email back about Longo's moving towards all corn based plastics with no definitive date.. and no answer to my follow up email. 

This is a grocery store that Styrofoams and shrink wraps a bunch of bananas. Everything is in plastic clamshell. The amount of waste is mind numbing.  

Its such a shame, honestly. The thousands of tonnes of these containers going into the landfill a year. A company like Longo's could actually us their position in the market to do some good, rather than just claiming they are for PR.

I've been here for lunch a couple of times and then for dinner tonight.  All 3 times have been spot on with the food - service is a little unpredictable but I'll still give them 5 stars!

Here's what I've had so far:
- kalbi (beef short ribs) lunch 
- bulgogi lunch
- bulgogi dinner
- Philadelphia roll
- shrimp tempura roll
- California roll

The lunch is by far a much better deal.  You get a miso soup, salad, dumplings and 4 pieces of California roll with your entree.  The kalbi is so delicious.  

The dinner portion of bulgogi ($16) tonight was huge and delicious.  Plus, a whopping 5 side dishes.  I gobbled up the rice and kimchi - I asked for seconds of both and there was still a few bites of bulgogi leftover.

Sushi was OK - not their strongest item here but it's always great going to a Korean place that has some additional options.  The rest of my family doesn't enjoy Korean cuisine but sushi suits them just fine.  We all win at Dasonii.",2011-11-13 02:23:20

This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.  But if you like a burger that was made when you order it or fries that are real potatoes and don't taste like the cup they came in then this place could be a great option.

They are a little pricier than your average quick service joint, but its worth it.  The portions are HUGE, even if you order the ""regular"" fries and the ""little"" burger they are still BIG.  They don't charge per topping beyond the norm like Smashburger, and they have tons of toppings to choose from.  Would love to see a fried egg option, but other than that the majority of burger loving taste buds will find topping options that please them.  They have some non-burger choices as well, which is nice.  Hot dogs, grilled cheese (which people keep saying is a must try) and a veggie sandwich.

Eating here is a 5 napkin type experience, a lil messy, a lil crazy, but oh so yummy!  Hint: if you are transporting 5 guys in your car, definitely put something between the bag and your (clothes, passenger seat, floor mat, etc..)  the grease WILL leak through the bag.


I agree with a below post that the placement of peanut snacking boxes are a little awkward  (and frankly I don't get why they exist at all, but whatever)

TEMPE Location Specific:  Could have just been the day I was here, but their Mr. Pibb tastes better than most places... who knows, perhaps they clean the machine well!  Parking is a bit of a challenge, it is on mill ave so it is meter parking and limited meter parking.  Mostly parallel, but next to American Apparel there are some standard metered spots as well.

They do offer salads, desserts, and drinks but unless you are sharing expect to pay a bit more for your pizza. Sharing is permitted with no additional fee.

On this visit my friend and I shared a vegetable topped pizza. Before you get it you are served 4 small breads with dipping sauce. They do not give you an extra plate for your pizza. While the food was average we usually end up taking the rest of it home.

Service is good. They are located right inside the main entrance of Ross Park Mall. You can choose to eat indoor or outdoor. It is really not a place I would go out of my way for but have to be in the mood for it.

They have WiFi but a very poor one to say the least. The place is clean and nice rest rooms.

Situated next to CSU, one of their downfalls is lack of a dedicated parking lot. This place can hold like 300 people and they have the option to valet for $15 or vie for street parking across the street. Live bands and wait staff encourage dancing in the aisles and table tops and even provide the words to the songs and short routines. Beer sizes come in huge and omg huge. Lots of carbs and fried feasting. Particularly enjoyed sauerkraut balls and goulash soup. Hall kind of reminds of the dining hall in hogwarts.

We came in on a Friday night around 9 with an hour until closing they had no food. Not even willing to cook more. I decided to give it a go and try anyways. Big mistake. First off they keep this place colder than a freezer on here. Even employees are wearing sweaters. I can get past that but what I can't get past is terribly fatty pieces with barely any meat. I know in some cultures this is acceptable but not when the meat is 90% fat. The pancit I got my with meat was absolutely disgusting. I have never met a pancit I didn't like and I couldn't even eat 2 bites. My boyfriend who never complains about food was very disappointed in his fish and squid. Very rubbery and unappealing. I wouldn't even come back to try again for fresher food because I'm sure I would be let down again and would waste my money. Way overpriced food and not worth the trip.

The first was about 9 months ago, where a lady friend of mine wanted to take me as she lived pretty close to it. We sat in one of the nice leather booths had a couple of cocktails and dinner. All of the patrons were super friendly and everyone kind of feels that because we all know and love this place, we should be awesome to each other. I love businesses that attract these types of people. Dinner was solid, I had a chicken sandwich sans the bun and garden veggies. I knew I would be back.

The second time was for a friends birthday dinner where we took a group of about 10. They surprisingly had room for us and nestled on nice leather couch towards the back. The cocktails again, maybe overpriced, but my Lawd they're delicious. They also have a great price for 3/4 pitchers of beer, so if you're a beer drinker, you're in good hands. 

This time I had the PicNic Skewers, which is essentially one skewer of steak, chicken, shrimp, and veggies, served with an amazing mustard sauce and tamitillo salsa. Delicious!

The vibe: On the floor on the left side of the restaurant you will see, ""You Should"" and on the right side, if you pay attention will see ""Question Authority"". I love this. Thousands of patrons will come and go and never see this hidden gem of their decor. 

The hallway to the restroom is lined with old cassette tapes, giving a great backdrop to a cute little date selfie. 

Around the corner from the restaurants is the cutest dessert store ever! Technically, its separate but its not. Its part of the experience. End your date (especially daddy / daughter dates) for the perfect end to a great evening out.

It's truly a unique place where you can have a good time.  It's bee over 2 yrs since my last review, which was when I still lived in this awesome city.  Since then, I've returned to the city several times and have watched the Strip gradually decline.  What was once a 5 Star experience is now a 4 Star experience.  Here's a breakdown of my thoughts:

Pros
+ It's still very exciting and full of energy.

+ Everything on the Strip is big and over the top.  It's a place where dreams become reality.

+ There's never a lack of crowds, no matter what day it is.

+ There's something for everyone....from low end joints for the value consumer to the luxury joints for the wealthy, you can find a wide variety of entertainment.

+ The people watching here is amazing and highly entertaining.

Cons
- The sidewalks are littered with freaks and idiots pan handling for money.  Dressed like super heroes (ok, that was cool for about 1 min) or weird outfits, these people harass you for money.

- There's still a large presence of sex pushers handing out cards for strippers (hookers) to your room.  It's annoying and most of the hand bills end up on the ground littering the city.

- There are a lot of sketchy people (pimps, drug dealers, and opportunistic criminals) mixed up in the crowds waiting to pounce on an unsuspecting victim.  There didn't use to be that much of this....only until the last 3 yrs or so has this really increased dramatically.

Overall, it's still a fantastic place to party and people watch.  I hope they clean up the sidewalks and return it to 5 Star status.

The ambiance is groovy in a refreshingly alternative way and could easily be at home in San Francisco. The music is usually really good, but can be a bit loud at times making conversation difficult. Still, a respectable first funky date location if I do say so myself.

On to the food, there are a few must haves: the truffle fries and the pork belly tacos. The fries go without saying on account of the truffle, while the pork belly tacos consist of simple ingredients that I would never expect to have worked together: tortilla, 3 cubes of fatty pork belly, an Asian glaze, and watermelon. Yes, watermelon. At $9 for two small tacos I could rightfully call it highway robbery. But you'll be paying for seconds and thirds (as I have been known to do) when these flavors combine to elicit tears of ecstasy as you fall to your quivering knees in a euphoric culinary-induced coma. I may have to clear my schedule tonight.

Honestly, I've never really had anything bad here--although I can say that the bone marrow challenged me a little. All aside, there is a reason that there is often 2 hour+ waits to get inside for dinner. They are amazing.

It's  kept pretty clean, it's not too big that it's impossible to get to any of the gates (especially now that the D gates have closed), and the restaurant selection is acceptable. 

There is a Starbucks at Gates A and C, so it's a safe bet that I will get my caffeine one way or another. There may be one in B but I never fly out of there so I would not know! They just opened a Fresh Brewed Tees on the way to C, which is an awesome idea. There is also a gelato place in C somewhere that I have always wanted to try. 

I have never had issues with any airport or airline employees - everyone is pretty well-tempered there, especially when you compare to the disgruntled employees of New Jersey or Houston!

 I will say that the flight selection is not ideal in most cases, but that is not the fault of the airport. 

I would recommend parking at one of the offsite parking lots, like Park N Fly or Park Place.

There was no topping of any kind. The Caesar salad had a very strange  dressing that tasted  unpleasant and not at all like the typical Caesar dressing should taste. I guess we just ordered the wrong food at this restaurant. This is a beer and burger joint and we should've stuck with the favorites.

The atmosphere however is perfect if you have a few friends with you and just want to hang out especially on a Friday or Saturday night.

We took a look around the inside.  They have chairs are made from old clothes that have been pressed (like boards).  They are quite heavy.

It was such a nice evening so we sat on the patio.  It was a great spot for people-watching on Queen Street W.

Gord ordered the Carbonara pizza.  He said it was good and would order it again.

I ordered Spaghetti all'Antonia.  The meatballs were really good.  The sauce was good ... I'm surprised that the pasta wasn't fresh, though (it seemed to be packaged).

For dessert, Gord and I split a Torta nera & gelato.  It was really good.  The ice cream contrasted nicely with the warm brownie/cake.  Gord's not into sweets but he said he would order one for himself next time.

We'll be back.",2012-06-14 01:12:32

One of my personal favorites is their lamb belly: lamb belly, butter lettuce sauce, and olive salad with oranges, parsley and some other herbs. I really enjoy their trout as well, its served skin on, with a romesco sauce, cauliflower, arugula and a grilled lemon. It sounds so simple but it has an incredible amount of flavor!

They have a large selection of colors, styles, and finishes. I am personally a fan of their pedicure services! The hot stones are a plus even on the standard pedi package.

My one complaint has to be due to my last visit where I asked for acrylic overlay and no one knew what I was talking about. I stood around while the receptionist paged various technicians. When she found one who was available, it turns out he was NOT qualified/certified/able to do acrylic... YET he was the young man who applied acrylic on my toe nail during my previous appointment. I asked him to apply it due to my big toe nails being so brittle and breaking during my pedicure. He seemed a little off and applied to only ONE toe even though I asked him to put it on both. I now know why! He was so nervous that he only did one and to be honest, it was the most awful shape and looked like a glob. 

I chose to move on and my gel mani with Daniel made up for it that day. It was kind of a slap in the face when I found out why my pedicure had been awful, I do not think he should have applied the acrylic if he was not qualified to do so. Even though they were busy, he should have asked or told me that it was not possible and why.

I've been wanting to try Mamma Toledo's ever since I had brunch at Short Leash about a week ago. My friend and I were having serious sweet tooth cravings so off we went in pursuit of pie. 

I find it to be slightly odd that Mamma Toledo's is located inside of the short leash restaurant, and that hasn't really been touched on very much in other reviews. When I called to see if Mamma Toledo's was open before heading out, no one answered. We took a risk and headed down anyway. 

There were so many delicious options, it was mind blowing. We almost went home with four different varieties. We settled on two, apple crumble and chocolate cherry creme respectively. Although, I think we both wish that we had taken home a brown sugar peach and a pecan as well. If only Mamma Toledo's served pie by the bite. What a wonderful world that would be.

b.  Parking - You are at a casino and have to walk a long way to get to the theater. You will need to give yourself time to get there  - 3 star

c.  Service - On July 4, what a mess. They had a lot of people at one time and the line was forming near the escalator which is a huge fire and safety hazard. Finally they got staff to fix this, but at the expense of pushing people around in line and doing this commando style and not with any organization or coolness to it.  - 1 star

e.  Theater - They have a huge theater for high def movies, and a  lot of smaller movies. I saw a movie in their smallest theater and it was rink dink. I think it is almost same as watching it on netflix. Spacing between the seats is tight for both shoulder room and leg room. Not a lot of thought went into this theater when you compare it to Rave (AMC 18) or Galaxy. 2 star

First impression the place looked cool, love the look and feel of the restaurant.  We had to wait close to an hour when there were only 2 small parties ahead of us which was frustrating.  To add to the frustration of waiting they don't have anywhere for you to sit while you wait so you're kind of just stuck walking or standing around til they call you.

The hostess was slow.  When she finally told us she'd clean off a spot at the bar for us to sit, that took her another 10 minutes.

Our server came (not promptly) and we ordered a dozen oysters and the hush puppies to start.  Hush puppies not worth the money, come with a bland sauce, nothing special.  Then never saw our waiter again.  We ordered the ribeye dish from the busser that kept passing by.  That dish was AMAZING and probably the only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars.  Meat cooked perfect, the sauce on top was awesome, and came with really yummy waffle fries.

We sat and waited around about 20 more minutes after our meal was finished.  As the hostess passed us, I asked for her help getting the bill.  She then walked around aimlessly for 10-15 more minutes, never told our waiter we wanted our bill... Let's just say by the time he FINALLY realized we still existed we were more than ready to get out of there.  We realized why it took so long to get seated... Because they take so long to take care of the guests that already have a seat.

Disappointed because they have an awesome menu and awesome food and really cool vibe... Decor, music... But the service was just terrible.

I liked the concept; the fact that the place was a bank; the variety of cocktails; the everyday deals; and that I saw all kind of people.

Some of the youngest groups were playing jenga. They were also some mature couples, close to the bar, dancing on the seats while drinking shots. Some guys were watching sports, eating, and drinking beer.

We didn't order food. But I gave the place 4 stars, because I love eclectic places in where you can do what you want.

I came back here twice in the past week as New City is undergoing renovations until the 18th, and I noticed they added a lot of new stuff in their menus. I tried a few of their new items, including beef enoki mushrooms in satay noodle soup and tonkotsu ramen.

The satay noodle soup didn't have enough soup to start. Once they gave me more soup, the meal was actually not bad! The tonkotsu ramen had decent noodles and pork, but the soup was quite sweet for my liking.

They recently discontinued the braised beef noodle soup. Thank god! That had to be one of the most MSG-y items I've ever had.

Elaborate paintings and sculptures adorn this large restaurant. Classy white tablecloths are draped on the generously sized tables and make you feel as if you are at a banquet. The staff are fancily dressed and will hand you heated hand towels after your meal so you can leave feeling thoroughly satiated and refreshed. How lovely.

A pity, then, that they serve obviously-defrosted and UNDERCOOKED chicken. I can look past the fact that the meat was previously frozen but there were too many times when I bit into the giant-sized chicken chunks in my Jalfrezi and got that gross, pinky-almost-raw taste and texture. Shudder. The chicken pieces that were cooked well were fatty and tasted old - not just previously-frozen old, just generally OLD, shrivelled and dull.

The naan bread I ordered came drenched in oil! It was unbelievably offputting to the eye. 

Service was pretty bad. The exception was one of our (many?!) servers who was unbelievably sweet. The other staff were aloof and really, really slow. It took an age to get the bill.

It really is a shame, because this restaurant has good prices; almost identical to places like Little India and Babur a few blocks north in a less-upscale part of the city. Also, the sauce in my Jalfrezi was one of the nicest I've ever tried. It certainly was, as the restaurant's name implies, 'Aromatic'! But with that undercooked chicken - never again.

About two weeks ago a coworker and I stopped at One of their locations near the Scottsdale Airpark.
We had both ordered a three piece meal. 
Now I've never had a problem with any of the locations I've ever stopped at before their chicken is always been nice and tender. And the food has been very good. 
Due to time constraints we got our food to go as we were headed back to our office.
The chicken received that day it was dry and crunchy and very overcooked. I could barely eat the chicken I had received, ended up tossing most of it in the trash. I commented on the survey on the receipt that the food was unsatisfactory and that I wanted the manager to give me a call. This was approximately two weeks ago and they have still not called me back. It is because of this reason I will I will never spend any money in any of their restaurant again. If they do not care how the consumers feel about their food and the customer service why should I spend my hard-earned money and their establishment.

Sept 19. Well after posting my comments on Yelp I finally heard from El Pollo Loco. They sent me a form to fill out. In which I told them about my experience. I received a phone call from one of the managers named Nick. Told him what happened. He told me they would make it right. I went in on Sept 18th for lunch after contacting Matt and they took care of me. The food was all that I expected it to and of the quality that I have come to know and love from ElPollo Loco.

The food, however, is where it's lacking. The fried chicken needs seasoning, and for $20, you would expect more than just two pieces of thigh (with two small side). My friend had the quarter smoked chicken, and smoked, alright. it was smoked til it was dried. It was presented in a mini cast iron pan. which is charming, but how do you cut the chicken apart in such an awkward 'plate'?

It sounded like lot of fun. So told my nieces next time go with their daddy (my brother) let me know always wanted to try my Inner Hawkeye. So the other week hanging out with Da Ohana perfect timing. 

Impact Archery talk about odd location or really nothing around it at night. Still easy too find just keep going on Dean Martin Dr once close to Skinny Fats depending on direction it located in the next set of office looking building next too it. Lot of parking in front at night since most of the other business are closed for the day. Not sure about the day since came at night. The front you would never think that they could fit any kind of range in it. It goes pretty far back. Up front they have a full store that sells all the latest equipment from archery too more game hunting archery. I have no idea anything archery for game or target shooting. So not sure if the brands or anything is top of the line. The diversity is there from bows, arrows and even the smallest trinkets that you need. Top of even shop that does all the little things or tune up for bows. 

Two adults and two kids. I thought for hour shooting was bargain. Groupon or not. I did notice that they have yelp check in offer. So if checking in don't forget too use it. The same price you get all the equipment rental same price!! I believe the older gentlemen was Frank. He did awesome AWESOME job of going over the safety rules with my nieces. Also adding in humor cracking jokes making my nieces know the rules but also go out have fun. Adults I enjoyed the refresher course cause last time went shooting was intermediate during PE. Once done with safety like go out shout four arrows wait till everyone done and hear all clear retrieve your arrows and do it all over again. They do have different distances to shoot at three in all so even ones for the kids. 

It lot of fun! They even have guys with the full on hardcore with top line bows and arrows. It make for great watching or makes feel better just to hit farthest target. The guys that tell go all the time. They were cool, friendly, one of them even was explaining all the targets on the wall meant to my niece, and never was big deal that first timers or kids sharing the same range as them.

cGryQPh_noi89hED8EwtvQ,hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,FvC3W9E6rXUYx-cTxbnUiA,1,3,0,0,"I will start off with what is good about Luna Rossa, since this is an update, I have been here on 3 occasions, all with different outcomes. The first time here I ate at the bar and it was a good experience. The second time, I ordered pizza from the take out window. While a bit pricey - still good. Lastly, I came here for dinner with friends on a Thursday night. Now, not my number one choice to dine on Fremont Street, but I relented to my friends who wanted to go.

First of all this is what Luna Rossa is - an Italian restaurant serving mainly pizza (out of a window, no less), that is attempting (and failing) to be an ""upscale"" (HAR HAR) restaurant on Fremont Street. Their menu reflects this, especially the dinner menu. Not one item on their dinner menu is under $10. I'm no cheapskate, but the menu itself falls incredibly flat. Appetizers that they didn't have. Pizzas that with so many toppings the thin crust becomes soggy in the middle (yeck!), and overpriced entrees!  I am not paying over $10 for spaghetti and meatballs unless I am sitting in a nicer looking dining room in a place where people aren't zip lining outside, okay? AND people better be dressed nicer, because obvi this place doesn't have a dress code.

The place itself looks like an eatery - not a fine dining establishment. There is PAPER on the tables for God's sake. My friends and I had the following -

Salmon Dinner Entree - One friend didn't want pizza so she got the salmon, said it was pretty good. BUT because me and my other friend ordered pizza - she did not get any complimentary bread. Yes, Luna Rossa will refuse you bread service if someone in your party orders pizza. RI-DIC-U-LOUS. It says so right in their menu.

Artichokes, Olives, Proscuitto, Peppers Pizza - I don't remember the real name, but I remember what was on it, because  with all of those toppings the thin crust became soggy very quickly. It was like eating moosh pizza in the middle especially.

Here's the kicker - Luna Rossa charges you an 18% gratuity - NO MATTER WHAT. You had bad service? Too bad, you've already been charged. There's only three of you eating? Too bad, you've already been charged.

What is this shady business? (OK - they have it printed in the menu, but that doesn't make it any less BS.) Even if our service had been outstanding, which it wasn't, it was just basically good service - I wouldn't have tipped MORE after the restaurant has the audacity to force a required tip on me. I think they're probably doing it because of their location. Perhaps they have a lot of tourists who don't bother tipping? I don't know, I don't care.

They also provide a complementary crème brûlée because it was my friends bachelorette party, which was really tasty and very nice of them.

The bartenders are really nice and tend to your needs. I did have to flag one down on a Saturday night after sitting at the bar for about 10 minutes. The variety of the cocktails is extensive and great. The food I've had has been pretty good but overpriced. I think the owners want this place to be a little more upscale than it will turn out to be, hence the overpriced food and cocktails. However, I really did like the atmosphere and I know I'll be back again soon. I look forward to re-reviewing this place in the future.",2014-02-15 00:05:06
Q_6_T31tnjB3KwNREHjUzg,AVVEFYHmFUa9oUhy2DIQFA,q_KQbgnaYDlPx8EHTydcBQ,4,1,0,0,"Kiko is a small HK style café located in the Michael Angelo's plaza on Woodbine & Hwy7. I had seen it around for many years but never stopped in to try it.

Their menu offers an extensive variety of foods from sandwiches to French toast to noodle soups to baked rice/spaghettis! 

Malaysian fried rice: This was delicious but a little too salty for my liking, comes with a handful of generous sized shrimps, topped with a fried egg and shrimp chip!

Laksa noodles: This was really good, the broth was slightly spicy and very flavourful, with a combination of egg noodles and rice noodles (we got the shrimp and chicken one).

Almond milk with egg whites: For an extra $1 (with combo) we upgraded to this beverage..it's rare to find a place in the GTA that makes this beverage with the egg whites.. it was steamy hot and had very thin slithers of egg whites in it.

Overall, I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu...including the reasonably priced afternoon tea menu, the French toast cubes.

PS. They have a vincity rewards points program!",2016-04-18 14:07:15

I'm really glad that there's a late-night full service restaurant with this much nightlife around the Selwyn area, it's a much needed amenity. I enjoyed the environment, although the inside was LOUD! Like you couldn't hear yourself think, loud), and the service was... well, it was a little strange.

We were promptly seated (I called ahead about 30 minutes before and asked how much of a wait there would be and I got the answer ""you should be good""), and then brought a...serving of chips and salsa? I knew these weren't complimentary here, so I told the guy that these weren't ours. Person #2 came up to our table shortly after and filled our water, and person #3 then came along and said that the chips were ""on them"" for the wait. What wait? Uh...what's going on? The chips were dense and suspiciously crispy, but I knew not to be impressed coming in. Salsa was good though!

We each got 3 tacos. We each loved one of them, and the other two were relatively plain. I enjoyed my crispy chicken and the lady enjoyed her tofu taco. 

I want to come back to hang out on the patio, and I regret that I didn't try any drinks, but it was a cool experience to check out. I'm glad I did.",2015-09-15 20:51:25
zVA79ARMhXtYeSwMIU74EQ,0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,4,5,3,5,"Im hungry. Lets see what pops up on my bookmarks. Well, would you look at that. Pop Up Pizza just happens to be about 3 blocks away.

First off, the place is located inside The Plaza Hotel and Casino. You can park in the Plaza parking lot for 5 bucks cash only (free for those that are gold or platinum or whatever card you need that the sign says at the gate). Dont worry though, keep your parking receipt, have the attendant at PUP stamp your parking receipt after you pay for your food, and then take that stamped receipt to the cashier at the cashier cage about 50 yards away so they can give you your 5 bucks back.

As you go up to the counter, you can see garlic knots and all the pizza that is available for purchase by the slice. If you refer to my pic, they have this combo menu right on counter. You have 6 options. I picked combo number 1 which is any two slices and a large soda for 7.99. I selected a slice of the Harris Meatball Pie and the Fremont.

The Harris Meatball Pie: Mozzarella, classic Italian meatballs, caramelized onions, olives and topped with fresh basil. Nuff said.
The Fremont: Mozzarella, Italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, roasted peppers, and roasted eggplant. Again, nuff said.

The only negatives I observed is that when you park in the Plaza parking lot, you gotta walk past the Greyhound bus station. That place in itself is a whole other review. http://www.yelp.com/biz/greyhound-bus-lines-las-vegas#query:greyhound%20bus%20station
Also, where the seating area is for PUP is basically in the wide open portion of the casino itself, meaning that whatever secondhand smoke is lingering around will give your pizza the smoke flavoring that you dont want.

Some random info: I was told there was free wifi but I couldnt get it to work for me. The domain is popup pizza. The password is popuppizza1. They are open daily from 11 am to 2 am for you guys that have the munchies late at night.

In closing, I think their thin crust pizza is pretty good. Its just the 5 dollar parking that you eventually get back, the scenic route to PUP, and the unwanted added secondhand smoke flavoring to my pizza that kind of ruins the moment.

It's really nice for picture purposes (come on, nitrogen frost coming out of the bowl is pretty dope). However aside from that...

The bad: we don't pay for something just to look good right? The ice cream itself was ok. It was colder than usual due to the nitrogen. The flavours weren't out of this world. I ordered the honey Crisps ice cream (basically similar to momofuku's cereal milk), and fresh lemon. Both were OK, but nothing too crazy. They put honey on a stick in case it's not sweet enough.

The ugly: lack is seating area, but this is probably due to their soft opening (I think?)

I first went several years ago when they were in a strip mall on S. Scottsdale Rd. Got dragged there by a couple local restaurant people who kept raving about it. Shockingly fucking spicy and delicious. One app had us hallucinating. Loved it.

Time passed and they opened up this great little house-style location further up the road. Apparently the chef/owner and his wife got divorced. She kept the place. I was worried. But she's making it work fantastically.



THINGS TO TRY:

steve the bartender's margaritas: you can actually taste the tequila, so call your favorite. i like the patron silver marg. many prefer the cadillac marg that has orange juice. bear in mind, when you are talking, steve is listening. he has ears like a bat. if you don't want him to hear you saying something embarrassing about yourself, don't say it.


shrimp fundido: white cheese melted over sauteed fajita-style veggies and big fresh-tasting shrimp. great with corn or flour tortillas.


chips: pretty good. the salsas are a little mild for my taste. not bland, they have plenty of tart and sweetness. just wish they were rounded out a little more.


smoked chicken tacos: only ask for this when it's already the special. they'll try to accommodate when it isn't the special, but it will pale. when it's a legit special, they use nicely smoked, succulent dark meat. not that cubed up breast junk. i hate chicken breast. 5 stars if they add this to the daily menu.


carne asada tacos: consistently best i've had in PHX.


carnitas: a very generous, juicy, tender portion. they always happily hand over flour tortillas for me.


beef short rib: get this if you require lots of flavor. and by flavor, i mean rendered beef fat.


Lots of other stuff on the menu, and always at least one app and one dinner special. Enjoy!",2008-09-20 23:30:07

The idea is simple, ribs wrapped in melting cheese! 

James Cheese Back Rib is a well-known franchise Korean restaurants.  Owner of this place is Chinese, he went to Korea and brought it back here to Toronto.

The regular size of ribs is for two people ($34), you can order additional portion for $17.  You will get 8 ribs, and side dishes that also cooked in the same pan (baked egg, baked corns, mashed sweet potato, steamed carrot and broccoli).

The ribs: they are very tasty, since it's franchise I believe the sauce is from Korea.  However, it is not cooked to the degree that meats fall of bone. At least that's how I like my ribs to be... The server will come to your table to wrap cheese around the ribs. And you are supposed to eat them together.  Both me and my friend love it so much! 

As for side dish, there are LOTS rooms to improve... They taste pretty bland.  I would like to see something like kimchi fried rice in the future.",2017-09-12 14:42:13

My favorite used to be Goyemon but they got really popular so the wait was always super long, they increased their prices to I think $26.99 for dinner and their fish to rice ratio is horrible now compared to before. Anyway...

Lunch ends at 3 and is only $20.95! We came at 2:30 and there were only 5 other tables in the restaurant. Service was great, sushi came out really really quick, dirty dishes were always taken away and waters were always refilled. 

Sushi tasted fresh, and they give you HUGE slices of fish. I think my only complaint is that the fish slices should be a little less thick because it's so difficulty to shove the entire thing in your mouth. Also the sweet sauces that they use on some of the rolls can be a bit too overwhelming. Other then that, good selection of rolls, limited appetizers (get the mussels and potbelly!), not AYCE dessert but by the end of your meal you'll be too full to care I promise. 

The unagi was soooo good. I tried the white tuna and didn't like it but my bf loved it, saying it's rare that an AYCE place would offer it. Of course I'm a salmon lover and ordered a bunch of salmon rolls. Yes you can order half rolls here!! Another review mentioned something about them charging extra for appetizers before dinner. That didn't happen when I went. One complaint I did have was that we had to ask for our miso soup 3 times! I thought they didn't have any but they just forgot about it.

As soon as you walk in, there is a glass case filled with pastries galore that kindly invite you to dine-in, in hopes that you may feel so inclined to delight yourself in such a tasty decadence. The menu is colorfully and largely posted above the welcoming cashier, patiently waiting to take your order. 

I decided on the mixed grill hot sandwich and a bowl of the vegan vegetable soup. We all ordered a sandwich and I truly appreciate the service from the order-taker. (Lord knows my family can be quite the particular orderers!) 

Onto the food! I can't speak for either my mom or fiancee but I will say I was slightly disappointed with my mixed grill sandwich. (To enlighten, I don't eat any dairy, so my sandwich was quite modified, to say the least!) I really only had the meat, onions, pickle, and bread. And while the flavors were still there (and exceptionally yummy!), the quantity left me frowny-faced. Nobody likes more bread than meat on a sandwich, am I right! I caught myself tearing pieces of excess bread a few times to get the perfect meat to bread ratio in each bite. No complaints against the yummy soup!

Dimly lit, velvety seats and curtains, leatherette tables and servers strutting in corsets. Rick Moonen going to our table and chatting with us.

There's one menu item I didn't fall in love with from RM and that's his lobster roll and I was surprised to see it on Rx's menu - I stayed away from that. They have an interesting drink menu but I can't really remember the drink names because they're soooo long like the Mario (something) Wrong Warp (something).  I wanted to try it but my attention span went out the door upon reading the name. 

We tried chicken pot pie nuggets, inside out French onion grilled cheese, bacon-wrapped bacon n egg, braised oxtail croquettes Dijonnaise, Moonen tater tots, Johnny's big dry-aged burger.  For dessert, we had the matcha panna cotta and the pie Americana.

Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets:
Fried pot pie balls with carrots, peas, chicken bits and a bit of soup inside.  It's like the Western version (fried and fatty) of xiaolongbao (Chinese steamed soup dumplings). Great idea but the nuggets could use a bit more soup in them. 3/5

Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese:
Provolone, parmesan and gruyere in the crispy sammie sliced diagonally topped with pickles and served with a warm, slightly onion-y beefstock dip. French onion soup meets grilled cheese, basically. 4/5

Bacon-Wrapped Bacon n Egg:
Toasted brioche with tomato jam, thick piece of bacon topped with a sunny side up quail egg, sprinkled with black sesame and chives with pea mousse on the side. My favorite dish of the evening...and quite possibly of any of Rick Moonen's creative ideas thus far.  I'm not even a fan of runny egg yolks...or egg yolks, period! But I imagined how they painstakingly cracked each tiny quail egg and fried them - I appreciate the patience that went into making this lovely dish. You got textures (crunchy, fatty, creamy) and flavors that compliment each other. There were 3 of us and a baby at the table and I ate 2 out of 3 (sorry, unfortunate person who didn't get to try one. You snooze, you lose). I had to do it. 5/5

Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijonnaise:
As the name implies...Dijon + mayonnaise = Dijonnaise. Two of my least favorite things combined to create something that actually wasn't bad. The croquettes were more like fried mozzarella sticks in appearance but had savory and mildly sweet oxtail.  Dip it in lemon aioli...oh my! 5/5

Moonen Tater Tots and Johnny's Big Dry-Aged Burger:
Shawn got a medium rare burger (what a shocker!) with double the truffle cheese so I got tater tots (comes with ketchup and tartar sauce) to go with it. The tots tasted better dipped in tartar sauce. The burger was very messy to eat.  It has pickles, lettuce, tomato jam, Balsamic onions and your choice of cheese from the cheese plate (truffle, fontina, brie, cheddar or bleu). The cheese that was added onto the burger didn't taste truffle-y at all and was more like brie...double brie isn't that good. 3/5

Mahalo Matcha Panna Cotta:
Matcha green tea panna cotta in a generous serving topped with macadamia nut tuile, li-hung mui pineapples and passionfruit sorbet. Loved this dessert an it was worth skipping the gym for. Creamy mild green tea panna cotta and tart passionfruit sorbet. 5/5

Pie Americana:
Classic apple pie re-imagined served with vanilla ice cream and walnuts. 4/5

These are your basic comfort food items. Anyone knows how to make these dishes and most restaurants have them.  But what's brilliant is reinventing the same dishes and making them seem interesting. I'm still hoping they could re-invent their lobster rolls though.  Service was good although there was some sort of confusion...with the complimentary bread which we didn't get.",2013-08-22 20:42:16

I happened to be waiting across the street for a bus, so I decided today was the day.

I should have caught the bus.

It wasn't BAD food, but it was a long way from what I'd imagined.

The fish isn't even something unique; it's frozen patties, deep fried and served. The chips (french fries) are also frozen. Blech!

They provide some ketchup-based sauce (ostensibly) for dipping. I asked for tartar sauce and was told it was $0.35 for 2 oz or $0.70 for 4 oz. (What a bargain)

I declined.

The fish and fries were not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but for $5 bucks I would like more than frozen fish patties and frozen fries thrown into hot fat and chunked on a plate.

I won't be paying Pete a return visit anytime in the near future.

My experience  with Carribean places has been shabby restaurants with great authentic food made with soul. This place didn't involve plastic furniture or island accents. I was suspicious especially when a hostess asked if we had reservations? Anyhow I had my 5 year old son with me. The menu is not what I would call kid friendly, nor is the ambience. My kid was on best behavior for some reason but I wouldn't suggest bringing yours here.  We shared the jerk wings with a killer cilantro sauce yum o. My friend had a chowder and crab cakes while I tucked into ""the best burger in Pittsburgh"". The best burger involves an egg and guacomole and bacon on the burger, not the best that I have had, I feel that Primanti Bros could offer some competition if burger judges weren't apathetic to that chain. My friend liked her food a lot. I ended up getting the lava cake a la mode which was decent because chocolate is always decent.

It's OK.. Seems like a nice date night spot but don't come expecting authentic Carribean dishes.",2013-11-05 02:25:07

My husband and I were researching certified pre-owned cars the night before, and a pre-owned vehicle at this dealership popped up. One day later, we were in the store purchasing the vehicle.
It is in beautiful shape, practically a new car with only 7,000 miles. We are thrilled with our purchase.
Some things that made our experience stand out:
*Each of us were able to take a test drive
*They have a college grad program at Volkswagen for financing (which we didn't end up needing), but it was still a cool feature
*A nice area to wait upstairs
*Once we purchased the car, they gave it a bubble bath to make it really shine, plus gave it a full tank of gas
*We got a freebie from the Volkswagen store, which was a cool bonus! 
*The financial side of things went very smoothly, no hiccups and we were able to get the price we wanted

I highly recommend Volkswagen North Scottsdale. We would definitely purchase a car there again, and Dave really took care of us!",2013-11-03 17:23:01

Then the meat on top and you pick your toppings. I got the jalapeño cream, pico, cilantro, lettuce and cheese although there are many other options. They were quick and I am still dreaming about them.

With a party of 5, we ordered three pastas (2 carbonara, 1 bucatini) and two pizzas (1 pollo toscano, 1 verde) to share. One thing I can say is that the food was definitely fresh. The pizzas were both generously topped with fresh and colourful vegetables, and the dough was baked to a nice plump and soft crust with crunchy edges. I really enjoyed the pollo toscano pizza because it had large chunks of tender seasoned chicken and also, let's just take a moment to talk about THE CHEESE. It was so beautiful how the melted oozing mozzarella left this stringy trail with every bite, as if it were saying to me ""No, you can't leave me, you have to come back and finish what you started""... I'm salivating just thinking about it. 

Their house-made pastas were also quite good, but rather unique. The texture of the noodles resembled Asian-style ramen more than anything, as they seemed to be egg noodles and had a bounce to the bite. A few people within my party of 5 didn't like this pasta due to that reason, but I found it to be neutral. I mean, overall, the flavours were good, it was sauced to the right proportion, and there was more shredded cheese to top it all off (mhmm cheese..). 

My only criticism for this place would be its price. For a ""purchase at the cashier"" type restaurant, I'm not sure the food is worth its relatively higher price point. Especially considering its location and its competitors in/around Chinatown and Kensington, I probably wouldn't pick this place as my first choice.",2016-09-24 17:07:36

I let the kids choose between this place and Sacred Hogan for a dessert capper after Mamma Mia's pizza.  One went with frybread the other with Sno Ball.

I liked this place immediately.  The congenial and conversant owner made us feel welcome as soon as we walked in.  I recognized that the shaved ice machine was older and more classical looking than the one I am used to seeing at our neighborhood Water & Ice.

As he began making the shaved ice for my daughter I could see that the product coming out was much finer than we are used to.  My daughter ordered grape flavor and he was so busy chatting with us that he made orange.  He noticed as he was finishing that he had grabbed the wrong flavor and offered a taste before making another one.  My daughter chose to keep the orange.  Light and refreshing!

dgWUuKBSmIEKfU_7A3y0Jg,wYTMFvw3_UetcniRKxtUzg,zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg,1,2,0,1,"Aye I really wanted to like this place. We were celebrating a birthday last night and my boyfriend is really picky about food (and also a vegetarian). I literally found this place by googling ""Best Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix"" then going through that list and seeing who had the largest vegetarian selection. Otro Cafe won with a large option of Vegetarian dishes plus they had elote and mole, both dishes I used to love growing up in El Paso that not many restaurants out here have!

It was a Wednesday night around 8pm, the wait wasn't horrible and they had a flamenco dancer performing so we sat inside. All the tables were completely full when we first sat down so the service was understandably slow, it took about 10min just to get our drink order then another 10min to actually get the drinks. In taking in everything and asking about what vegetables they use for the vegetarian dishes, they definitely gave off a hipster vibe. The veggie list changes slightly but they had a mix of Kale, Greenbeans, onions, chili pepper, mushrooms, sometimes carrots and asparagus, either way not a list that screams authentic Mexican at all. But thankfully my boyfriend reluctantly gave it a shot. 

We started off with a small Guac, nice simple delicious, as well as the Elote which was AMAZING but not worth the $7 price tag. I still highly recommend it so if you give the elote a try, after they cut the corn off the cob for you at your table...take a look at that oh so delicious (but tiny!!) little pile and think, $7 really? That would probably not even fill a little white cup that you'd normally get back in the good ol days. 
We were still very hungry and anxious for the full meal and that's when my fears that the other lesser star reviews on here were right...the service was SSSLLOOOOOOOWWW! But we'll get back to that.

The food arrived and looked great! However one bite of their ""rice"" and I quickly got a sour face, looking over at my boyfriend he had the same expression. Worried, I slowly cut into my Chicken Mole and it was...definitely an acquired taste. Nothing like what my Grandma used to make and she's from Mexico! I tried to describe it as a bitter charcoal taste, or like they tried too hard to make it unique and used every herb and spice they could find. I scooped off little samples of the paste for everyone else to try so they could share in my sorrow and they agreed. It was way to overwhelming to eat so I just tried to make the best out of this whopping $24 dish and at least eat the chicken underneath. Even that was trying. The chicken was very dry and unseasoned, I felt bad for the person who was paying for my meal as I couldn't even finish it. My boyfriend's veggie enchiladas didn't fare any better, it was like everything was completely overpowering, unbalanced and sauces/rice were flavored to hell. 

We were left still very hungry :( So we hoped to order dessert for our birthday celebration and save the night, I mean how can you screw up dessert? From the time it took us to ask for the dessert menu, get it, and the waitress finally come back to ask what we wanted it had been 30 MIN! at that point we just said forget it, it was 9:30 and by the time we would have gotten the dessert who knows.

My goodness the efficiency of our waitress was horrendous. She kept saying ""thanks for your patience"" but after each time it felt disingenuous considering that at about 8:30 half of the inside tables were completely empty and stayed that way. 
We sat waiting for the check, for what felt like forever, I was tempted several times to just go to the front and ask someone to ring us out. Comments from the party about just wanting to get out of there left everyone anxious and pissed off on the poor wait times for simple little things, I was as well. What a sad birthday, couldn't even enjoy a dessert because the service was extremely lacking. Usually most restaurants, at a normal pace, can easily have you in and out in an hour. We were stuck there for over 2hrs! 
Overall I struggled to give this place even 1star, it was mainly just on the environment w/ a live performance and that overpriced addicting elote.

We all grabbed a Lunch #2: Chicken Tikka, Dwane Handi, seasoned rice, naan and tomato soup. It was good, but not the best. Chiken tikka was juicy, but the tikka sauce seemed less complex than others. Dwane Handi is good, tomato soup was pretty standard, naan was okay. The portions aren't that big, but it did the trick. I just was more sad about the tiny dollop of rice. I mean isn't that the point of the rice and naan is to sop up the sauces and flavors of the dishes? By the end I was just taking spoonfuls of the dishes since I was out of rice and naan which to me is a travesty. This Asian has to have rice!!! 

$7.95 isn't bad for a lunch, but with a lot of Indian places offering a buffet for $9-11 it isn't necessarily value when compared, but good value for being the only Indian in the SW and few places with lunch specials there.

Service wasn't really personable. We didn't get any drink refills and when ordering drinks he took mine and the BFs drink order and turned around without asking our friend if they want a drink. No drink for you!

I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only ""try"" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is. 

Moving on, we somehow ""lucked out"" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale. 

The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose. 

The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up. 

The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable. 

The fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well I'm not really one to combine seafood and cheese, this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and I'd recommend it to a first timer, +1 if you request to add spinach. 

Finally moving on to the entrees, different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors, assortments and sizes. 

I myself ordered what I was told is sort of the house specialty ,call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal. While it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me, the flavor of the pork wasn't really there, at, all. 

I browsed over a couple other reviews and noted the same complaint but hey that's what hot sauce is for I guess.

On the two occasions I visited, I found the experience to be lacking overall.

The myriad selection of beers was the main claim to fame for the restaurant, which is/was located on an upper terrace (and accessed through a nearby building) in the Sussex Centre, but it didn't really do anything that great that other pubs haven't already tried. You can go to virtually any pub (like the Crooked Cue in Port Credit, for instance) and get a selection of 50-60 different beers without the pretentiousness.

The second time my friends and I went, about two months ago, we called ahead to reserve a table thinking that it would be packed. We were told that there were plenty of spots available, but when we arrived 15 minutes later, I was told that all the tables were filled, and the waitress seemed to be dismissive of me (I'm thinking she looked at my friends and thought we were too rowdy?). When I looked into the restaurant, it looked barren, oppressive and half the tables were empty. Not wanting to bother with the waitress' pretentiousness, we left and ended up going to the Tilted Kilt down the street.

I hate comparing restaurants, but the oysters here while fresh and tasty just doesn't offer the same interesting flavors as the oysters at Other Mama (who has better condiments and oysters). Everything else while delicious is nothing special. The grilled bread could either be toastier or softer as tearing it required some effort and wasn't the easiest to bite into, which made the terrines a bit much to eat. The three sauces (a pineapple, mayo, and cocktail condiment) could also use some reworking. The pineapple condiment worked well with the crab but overall they just didn't pack much flavor or work with most of the bento box except the cocktail-ish condiment working on the usual shrimp and oysters. You could find similar in many other French/New American restaurants. There is nothing new or unique or executed better than normal. I like the Bento Box (it's fresh and tasty), but it's unlikely I'll order it again or recommend it for others when there's so many other dishes here to try!

The Hamachi is fun in its presentation. The flavors here complement each other wonderfully and is a nice light dish to start your meal with.

The Beef Skewers... was sold out last time we visited, so we were very, very excited to finally be able to try it this time. The chickpea relish and crepe while tasty couldn't quite save this dish for me. Perhaps I'm not sure how skewers should be had but it was a bit dry and I like my red meats on the rarer, juicier side. The chickpea relish wasn't enough for me to offset that dryness. The meat still has good flavor, but if I were to recommend a heavier, meat dish I would definitely go with the campfire duck instead (which is straight fire!).

We finished this off with a Calamansi Tart, which was absolutely delicious! I usually find tarts too sweet or sour, but this was perfect! The vanilla merengue, blueberry all had a nice slight tang and crunch from the crust. This went by super fast. Enjoyed this dish over the Black Sesame Crepe (where the cherries just had too much of a punch). Would definitely like to see more dessert offerings here.

Not every dish will be a hit, but the freshness of the ingredients used here are undeniable. Everything has a nice clean, rich palette to it.

5 Stars for the very personable and friendly service, but today's dishes would otherwise have been a 4.",2017-06-01 09:31:16

Although I am just now getting started with Life Storage for our storage needs, I looked at a lot of facilities in Las Vegas before locating this particular Life Storage.  The bottom line was that most storage facilities in Las Vegas are traditional swamp cooler cooled.  If you walk into one of these facilities, it most likely will have wood walls (to keep cooler) and has the almost damp quality to these dry hot spaces.  Depending on what you are storing, this might be fine.  If you are storing anything that might be damaged because of temperature, this would be a game changer and non-starter for your storage needs. 

This particular Life Storage is unique in that is a large, three story structure that is air conditioned.  So when you go inside, the inside units are maybe kept somewhere between 78 and 80 in the summer.  If you go to other facilities and then go here, you will notice the temperature difference.  

So with that, Life Storage on Wigwam had me because they are air conditioned.  Stacie, Melissa and Alan were all most helpful to me in arranging my unit reservations.  You can hold on and reserve a unit for up to five days I think before you have to pull the trigger or walk away.  They will also put your name on a waitlist if need be for certain sizes too.  This place seems very booked though, so make do your homework in advance.  

The units are cement floors, partial cement and particle metal walls.  The facility seems safe, super clean and did I mention, air conditioned (I am not worried about cold in winter, but heat in summer could be bad for storage). 

They have easy on-line options for payment and keeping track of your unit too.",2017-08-14 03:59:38

It's a big pub and has a private section that can be reserved.  It also looks like it also sometimes has live bands, which is a cool idea.

There were a lot of reasons why it didn't work out well.  The place was clubbing loud, which is acceptable for a club but not a bar.  I like a good chat with my beer, thank you very much.  It also took over 1 hour for me to get my food, and then I had to chase the waitress down for some cutlery.  I asked for a discount, she wasn't apologetic.  Then about half an hour later, a man in a cheap suit comes up to me and asks about me... I was a little confused about who he was and whether he was hitting on me.  I almost introduce myself thinking he was another guest at the party, but realized that he was the manager.

The manager kindly offered me free dessert or 5%? off my bill?  I wasn't sure because it was so damn loud!  I accepted the discount.  He said, ""sure, the free dessert then?"".  I rolled my eyes.

Here's some business tips for Fionn MacCool's:
- Unless there's a live band playing, the music shouldn't be clubbing loud!  A good conversation with beer is a good combo.
- Don't take 1.5 hours to bring out pub food, there's nothing gourmet about it, it shouldn't take that long
- Give your waiters and waitresses enough say to give a customer a discount, especially when they mess up
- By the time the manager has to come out to deal with the issue, just waive the whole bill, come'on guys... and what kind of discount is 5%?  That's just embarassing.",2014-07-19 23:51:31

Why is this the review that will serve as this reminder when I have so many Yelps explaining so much about that already? Well:

I went here on an anthropological adventure. I'd heard the regulars were noteworthy in a Bikinesque fashion. That they're scary and funny and local and Cheersish... And that everything takes forever. And that everything is average but that it's the combination of the preceding factors that make this place worthy of one adventure to see how the other half live in their natural habitat.

We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY, like within seconds, greeted by a drunken song. A man and a song and a twinkle in his eye and I was immediately charmed. 

I was expecting it to smell very strong, especially since they sell cigarettes in the vending machines, but really there was no noteworthy odor. 

The bartender was high or drunk. If she was not high or drunk, she's spent so much time in her life being either high or drunk that she now gives off a permadrunkenhigh vibe. For instance, she takes our drink orders and says, ""Want menus?"" and then walks away and re-asks us our order, which was a pitcher of beer. And then does not ever bring menus. Glazed eyes. I don't give a fuck ethos. 

AMF is on the menu, which I had to be reminded stands for adios mother fucker, which is just basically telling the drinker that this particular night will not be one they should bother trying to remember. Here, I could make some grand (albeit stupid) statement about how this is exactly the type of place people come to forget, but I don't think that's true considering I was the only one drinking them. 

The one gentleman we interacted with was so desperately lonely that he clung to every vestige of a chance of an opportunity to insert himself in our convo and I felt deep sympathy for him. 

All and all, I can't see any reason to ever go back but I'm glad I went and that it exists. It serves a need. It serves a population. It offers an opportunity for snobby a-holes to have a place to go on ""anthropological journeys.""

I've sampled quite a few of their offerings - the chocolate chip cookie, a simple bagel with cream cheese, and a bacon, brie and applesauce crepe - and all have been delicious. The crepe seems to be very popular in the below reviews and I can see why! Great combination of ingredients, in just the right proportions, and the crepe was cooked perfectly. I don't even care of the cookie is from Costco (I don't believe it is) - it tasted fresh and delicious and that's all that matters.

I'm not a fan of their hot espresso drinks, the espresso tastes too weak and watery for my liking. For some reason though, the same espresso tastes much better in the iced drinks?! I love their iced mocha in particular. Their English Breakfast tea is also very nice and authentic.

Staff are generally nice, but the service almost always seem a bit chaotic and disorganised whenever I'm here. Give yourself time, especially if you come on the weekends. That is my only minor criticism of an otherwise excellent and unique coffee shop in Torontos best neighbourhood!",2015-05-05 12:20:17
lOnVORpDb2cRf7mHakzBOA,IJkRnIzsdzuPXK2Ej7frag,JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw,5,4,0,0,"I wasn't going to write a review for Chinato yet, since last Saturday was my first experience there and we didn't really try too many of the menu items. We just went in for a light dinner before a concert. Like I said, it was prime time -- just before 7 pm on a Saturday night. We tried Butcher & the Brewer and Greenhouse Tavern first and were told the wait would be at least one and a half hours. I was beginning to panic, but we walked in to Chinato, and were greeted warmly by the hostess, despite it being a busy night. She seated us immediately on the condition we'd be done by 8, which was no problem for us. 

Anyway, the service at Chinato is what inspired the writing of this review. Bruell's restaurants are known for their spot-on service, so I guess I'm not really bringing up anything new here but honestly I don't think my grandmother could have taken better care of us. We weren't there to rack up a huge bill -- we ordered a cheese tray and we each ordered the smaller portion of a different pasta dish. And one drink each. That was really all we had time for, and it ended up being all I had room for. We ate so. much. cheese. They don't just carve up some cheese in the back and bring it out to you on a rustic-looking wood board. They have a dude devoted to the cheese selection, so when you order a cheese board he'll come by with his tray of a dozen or so cheeses. He asked us about our preferences and gives a little description of each one, and after a lot of deliberation we decided on five. Pretty cool presentation -- and every cheese we tried was unique.

My point is that the wait staff treated us no differently for being a rather small check -- which SHOULD be the norm, but unfortunately I've experienced the opposite at other restaurants. I've been plenty of places where, at the first sign of thriftiness, the service plummets. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic, not to mention very considerate of our schedule. We were running low on bread when the cheese service came around, and so we asked if we could just get a few more pieces. We were asked if we wanted bread or crostinis. We said crostinis would be fine, and they appeared seconds later, in addition to another basket of bread. We also had trouble deciding which pasta dishes we wanted, and our waiter directed us to his two favorites, both of which turned out to be phenomenal. 

I've been to Cowell & Hubbard, Parallax and several times to L'Albatros, but this by far my favorite Bruell experience, even though it was short. I am very excited to go back and get a better feel for the menu.",2014-11-19 15:50:00

I love that all I have to do is hop up 14th street, swing a left, and I can wander the aisles full of tools. I think I was a carpenter in a past life.

I've been eyeing up Dremels online for the past year or so, ever since an ex-coworker mentioned to me that he had one to carve out words and designs in rock. Home Depot was my stop yesterday to finally pick one up. I started out by looking at the categories for each aisle to figure out where I was going to find my new rotating friend. It didn't take long for a staff member passing by to stop and ask me if I needed help finding anything. ""Yeah, actually, I'm trying to find a Dremel."" ""Dremel? Sure! You should find them in Aisle 6."" Aisle 6 is exactly where I found them.

Next stop, flooring. I figured some slate tiles would do me well. With the large signage in the store, it wasn't hard to figure out what direction to head in. On my way to the back of the store, two other associates gave me a smile and asked if I was finding everything I needed. Note to self: Always hit up Home Depot early on a Thursday afternoon.

Last stop- it's time to pay. I walked upto a till and was greeted with a friendly smile: ""Would you like a bag for these or will you be okay without one?"" I went without, but I appreciated the ask. 

On other Home Depot visits, I've had less help, especially when the store is busier. But even so, the aisles are always neat, products are always arranged in a way that's easy to find and on the right pegs, and I have yet to encounter an employee on the floor and at the cash registers and self-serve kiosks who wasn't anything but pleasant.

Thanks for being easy to crush on Home Depot, I'll be back again soon :).",2011-02-25 21:03:39

It looked like instant noodle ramen and was waaay undercooked (practically crunchy) and the eggs were cold.

If you think that you're not into antiques, you may be surprised.  They cover a lot of various subject matter here.  There are a lot of modern things, and it's not all reminiscent of your grandmother's porcelain raccoon figurine collection.

There are a few notable areas of interest: A Tiki section, a large book area, toy sections, vintage clothes, casino memorabilia....  I've found everything from just a few short years ago to ""Oh hey!  I had that... as a... kid...."" as the horrifying realization sinks in that some of my favorite childhood items are now considered ""antiques"".  And then I buy it.  It truly is a vicious cycle.

But there's all kinds of crazy things from the 1950's-1970's, and some of it is so random and eclectic, that it's fun to browse.  Of course, not all of it is perfect, but perseverance pays off, and it's common to find some ""hidden awesome"".  The place is big, though.  You'll spend some time walking, but it's not hard to navigate, and there are staff around pretty regularly for help.

The biggest  downside of this place is that it is weird to get to.  You have to do some really strange navigating, as while this place is ON Charleston, it's not OFF OF Charleston.

WOW!!! Firstly, I barely put 9 miles on that damn loaner, just used it for a few short trips around town until my RR got fixed.

Can you pls calculate the ROI on me before accusing me and pointing fingers?

Because of that, I kind of have a special hatred of fine art, the kind of hatred usually reserved for fractions or Canadian history.

The architecture of this museum is incredible. I love the changes they've made. I also enjoy the increase of attention and space they have for contemporary art. (Did we really need an entire ROOM of Henry Moore sculptures? DID WE?)

Back then, you couldn't sketch a lot of the exhibits, much less take photos. At the Thursday night event I was at, it seems they were totally cool with it. 

Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to tour the entire museum as it's pretty huge, and I was bummed that I didn't get to see the giant burger, which is basically the ONLY thing I like in the permanent collection.

Saying that, the museum did something that many art museums fail to do: it left me with the desire to return. So kudos to you, AGO. I will visit again. But seriously, stop asking me for money. The student membership was $15 and that was 10 years ago. I'm done.",2013-05-15 18:20:54

I'm a fan of Burlington stores in general, because each location has got something different. Clothes, home accents, kitchen tools,  and even pet stuff. You just never know what you'll find.

One visit, you may get lucky and find a few deals, and on another visit, you may leave empty handed. This location is pretty well kept like the other location in Henderson. The location on Sahara is almost always a pig sty though, IMO.

One of my favorite  areas to shop is in the Housewares area scoping out stuff to add to our kitchen and on this visit, I came across a copper mug which I've always wanted to get for some Moscow Mules, and $9.99 is a steal because you can't even get them this cheap online!  After searching high and low,  front to back on every aisle in housewares, I came across an identical copper mug and some sphere ice cube molds at only $7.99.

Every time i've gone there, there has been three certainties:

1. I will get the scrambler, because I love scramblers. (Comes with an add in like a veggie or meat. Note that a few of the add ins aren't too great of quality)
2. I will get a milkshake, because I love milkshakes. (Comes in numerous flavors, all are at least decent)
3. It will be extremely busy, because Badger gamedays / the only other place open for breakfast nearby is Indie Coffee, and their menu is too different to even make comparisons to Mickie's.

So yeah, i'm pretty satisfied every time I go there, but not in a ""I just had an amazing and unique dish"" way, and not a ""I just made healthy choices"" way, but in a ""I came in hungry, and now I am leaving full"" kind of way.

Mickie's isn't a 5, because they haven't made my favorite scrambler or milkshake ever, but they do a good job at making scramblers and Milk Shakes, so a 4 it is.

Las Vegas is a town for people to come to spend money to get entertained, so my review will primarily focus on the value proposition of the ciruqe shows. Is this show worth spending $100-150 for 90 minutes? No. There isn't any unique acrobatic material in this show that isn't available on the Internet or on tv shows like America's got talent. The filler part before the next act of the show is being prepared is really not that funny.  I will not go into details about the show since it my spoil the show for some.

Lahmajouns are 10"" flat pieces of dough with various toppings added on it. They're then rolled to make a sandwich and consumed. This is usually followed by moans of pleasure and satisfaction.

I've tried a number of different items and I've always left satisfied. I think my favourite are the Philly Joun and the pesto pizza.

Try it with the yogurt drink - it can take some getting used to but it really compliments the flavours of the Joun.

The ambiance of the restaurant is great. High ceilings, an impressive wine cellar, and high end decor definitely gives it the high-end feel of The 9. Unfortunately, the quality of the decor did not match that of the food.

We started off with the pita pillow and dips, which sounds and looks better than it tastes. The pita was oversalted and the 3 dips were nothing to write home about. The waitress brought out a polenta dish, complement of the chef...which looked like a glorified crouton and tasted like stale bread. Chris got the iberico pork, which he said he only semi-liked.

The one redeeming part of my meal was the chicken francaise with brussels and polenta. The flavors of the dish worked well together and I would order this again if I had to come back.

I am always very clear that I am not interested in a membership and I pay cash at that time. Last year they insisted on having my ATM card on record even though I was paying cash but assured me that if there were any charges made to my account all I would have to do is call the corporate office. sure enough the first of the next month they charged the membership fee to my account. Every month for six months thereafter they charged my account. I sent emails and called their corporate office countless times during that time, never any response. Ultimately, I had to handle it through my financial institution and have them block them as an authorized retailer for accessing my account. This year I went in for my same pre-summer tanning sessions and they told me I owed them over $400. Once again I explain that I had never been interested in a membership and have never signed up for one. I was able to contact the corporate office at that point in time and got the matter straightened out, all charges were removed because I had never used any other sessions other than the month I had paid for (which is what I told the girl I was purchasing in the first place). I went back into the salon once again paid cash and started tanning, figuring I would put my best foot forward. I went in the following month and paid cash once again for my month of tanning, I just went in the store to try to tan and they informed me that I owe them over $200 for my unpaid ""membership"" for the past two months. I explained to the girl I did not have a membership & I did not authorize you to access my account. I have paid cash anytime I was interested in tanning sessions. She says I am not tanning if I don't pay. I called the corporate office and got voicemail so I called back to the billing department as I was explaining the situation the girl hung up on me. When I attempted to call her back the line continues to ring busy. I was not raising my voice or being disrespectful or rude in any way.

Even though it is on the other side of the planet for us, we don't mind making the trek out here every so often. Why is that, you ask? Well, I'm so glad you asked!

And, what better place than a resort practically across the street from Fashion Square. Firesky Resort is almost literally in the heart of it all -- Scottsdale, that is. Minutes from Old Town, mere seconds from the best restaurants in town, and nanoseconds from comfort and relaxation. 

Firesky isn't too stuffy or too fancy or too oh, la, la chic -- it's just the right amount of luxury for a down-home city girl like me. The grounds are tranquil and relaxing  -- you don't even feel like you're in the city when you walk around the place, especially since there are little bunny rabbits running around everywhere. The staff is genuinely nice and very accommodating. And, one, in particular, likes to flirt, which totally made me blush but also put a much needed smile on my face. 

The rooms are nicely appointed, with comfortable beds and linens, and the bathroom has two separate mirrored vanities that adds a nice touch when sharing a room with another gal. Additionally, each room has a very nice patio area with two relaxing patio chairs. 

Finally, their pools are the centerpiece of the resort. One is a lagoon style pool that you enter from a ""beach"" and the other is a larger pool with a nice water feature. They also have a jacuzzi off to the back.  The pool area definitely has a tropical island feel to it, with tons of mature palms trees dotting the perimeter of the area.  There are wooden bridges that cross over the pool; tons of little nooks with comfy chairs and plenty of lounge chairs around the pool area. They even have a couple fire pit areas that seem like they'd be awesome areas to hang out at when the temps start dropping. 

And, to top off everything, this price was just right!  Of course, I got a deal because it was summertime in Phoenix, and every resort is having a special.  But, I have a feeling that any time of year, Firesky offers reasonable rates compared to other resorts in the area.  I definitely will keep Firesky in my top places to stay in Scottsdale.  And, the next time I need a break from everyday life, I'll definitely head to Firesky.",2010-09-15 03:29:28

A month ago I went in and bought two electronics: A sooo cute Air Pop Popcorn Maker - it looked like a little red wagon! That night I went to put it together and ONE piece was missing, the top part that covers the top and lets you hold your popcorn in that container. Well the next day I took it back, told them my problem. They offered my money back or get another one. I chose another one - it was just too cute. But before I walked out of the store, I opened it and checked it. :( It was missing the same piece! So I just got my money back.

The second thing I had got was a blender. I finally put it together last night. When grabbing the last piece I heard a tinkling noise. I looked and saw broken pieces inside the box. :( The part that turns the blades was cracked in pieces! GRrrrr!!! So I took it back last night. The lady was super nice and gave me my money back with no problem. She just asked what was wrong, I showed her and she processed everything.

It was disappointing that two major appliances I purchased were pretty much lemons. But the cashiers made it so easy on returning my items. I was worried at first with the blender because I didn't want them to accuse me of breaking it. But it was broken at a spot that it couldn't have been broken from the store to my house.

First of all, their food is overpriced unless you order off of the limited value menu or are just getting fries or Krispy Kreme donuts. You can get a pound of cheese fries for 5 bucks which is probably the best value they offer. It's pretty ridiculous that they're charging $6-8 for a Chicago style hot dog...there are more authentic and cheaper options in town if that's what you're looking for. 

I had a char turkey burger, 6 piece pigs in blanket and a strawberry shake. The turkey burger tasted like a normal beef burger, mainly because of the char from the grill. Either that or they gave me the wrong burger! The pigs in blanket were a little burnt and mostly blanket and not enough pig. The strawberry shake was decent and I finished it pretty quick. Although it still doesn't compare to In-N-Out's strawberry shake.

Try the chipotle sauce on your dog! Recommended by the guy behind the counter and totally a solid choice. Also, the hickory sticks were a win for me. Corn relish was nice too.

It has a very authentic atmosphere and reminds me of bars/restaurants in Spain, from the hanging hams to the bar-top display of tapas.

As this is a tapas restaurant, the menu is dominated by snacks (Pintxos, Montaditos, and Croquetas). Every snack I have tried here, across multiple visits, has been absolutely delicious. My favorites are the oxtail and jamon. Some reviewers have complained about being surprised by the price-to-quantity ratio of these snacks. I encourage you to look at the tapas that are on display on the bar as you enter the restaurant... this will give you a sense of the quantity of food you are getting, and you can decide which ones are worth it to you. They may not be huge, but the snacks I have tried are rich and delicious and worth it.

Then there are small plates to share. I haven't tried any of these yet, but they look great!  Finally, there are big platters that are meant to be shared (and commonly are combined with snacks and small plates). I tried the ribs platter on my first visit here. They were good, but not mind-blowing. I think we expected something a little more unique from a place like this, considering how inventive and amazing our experiences at Cure had been in the past.

In the one full dinner I've had here, we had churros for dessert. The sauce is delicious and the flavor of the churros was fine, but they were so thin!  I was expecting more substantive ones, based on my most recent experiences in Barcelona.  Not sure I would order this for dessert again.

Although the restaurant is usually pretty busy and advance reservations are necessary on many nights, the bar is first-come, first-serve and often has space. You can order any of the snacks to enjoy at the bar. I love that you can stop in on a whim and order a drink and a snack or two.

It was a lot busier than I thought it would be, but it was probably only just for the afternoon tea specials they had. A meal with a beverage included, it is a pretty good deal with prices ranging from $4.99 to $7.99. Just be careful what you order as toast is a whopping $4.99!

I decided to go for a Meat Sauce Linguini, which wasn't all that great, but decent... I literally couldn't decide on what to get, so kind of just pick it. The drink was a Red Bean and Grass Jelly Mix, and was also just alright. Didn't eat much of the red beans, as the balance was a bit off with too much red bean, but not enough grass jelly.

I'd read the reviews on here and I was going to book an appointment with Hiroki but I didn't want to wait so I thought I'd take a chance and try Chiro. She was nice, albeit english was not fluent.

I thought she'd ask me what kind of cut I wanted, but maybe she assumed I wanted to maintain the same style. I have a bob cut that I've been doing for years. One of the reasons I don't get my haircut outside is that I'm never happy with the cut. I have straight, thick asian hair. It never turns out the way I want it to. I thought I'd give this place a try because of the great reviews.

All I wanted was to have a bob cut, but have more body in the back. I was surprised when she sort of halfway stopped cutting my hair and began to blow dry. When I inquired she said she wasn't finished cutting yet. So I waited...and I noticed my hair pretty much looked the same.

When I asked her if she could layer it some more, she took out the thinning out tool and began hacking away.

When it was done, the back of my head was flat and I wasn't happy. I reluctantly said ""thanks"" and paid and left.  When I got home it began to eat at me. Why did I spend $45 including tax and tip to get a cut I could have at home.

I wasn't sure what to expect after going through the Yelp reviews but I'm happy they didn't deter me from visiting Bestellen.  The service here is phenomenal! The host and our server were on the ball - very friendly, attentive, and answered any questions we had.  

The space is very charming. Front of house is smaller but as you walk past the bar area the space really opens up. 

Initially, we had only wanted to try the oysters but ended up adding a charcuterie board to our meal.  The board comes with their incredible yummy sourdough bread, pâté, different meats that melt in your mouth like butter, and pickled veg. Great portion for sharing or starters - I would definitely recommend.  Oysters were delicious as well, and they were just flowing out of the kitchen. You can also get the sauces on the side for an additional $2, it includes their housemade hot sauce and a garlic vinaigrette. Both sauces compliment each other and the oysters very well. 

So two dozen oysters and a charcuterie board later we're fully sated and very content. I'm excited to return and try the other items on their menu. Great experience from start to finish.",2016-09-22 17:56:19

Aside from that, the only other thing to note aesthetically is the button activated sliding front door which just seemed... odd for a burrito joint. Needless detail? Yes.

The food! It was pretty damn good. I opted for the baked chicken burrito, which I'll say right off the bat was good, but if you're looking to maximize your tasty, go for the ground beef or pulled pork. Anyway, the name Fat Bastard Burrito is warranted, because these bad boys are thick and filling. I got a ""lil"" size and was still healthily satisfied by its conclusion. They stuff the burritos with everything but the kitchen sink: beans, rice, lettuce, cheese, pico de gallo, cilantro, green onions, sweet peppers, jalapenos, mild salsa, coleslaw, sour cream, burrito sauce, hot sauce, guacamole, burrito spice, chicken. Of note, the chicken was cooked well, but it didn't have much seasoning, if any, which I suppose they can pass without considering the myriad of other ingredients, but what can I say; the heart wants what the heart wants. Lastly, I really appreciated how when I asked for spicy, they treated me like an adult and gave me bonafide spicy.

To sum it up, it was obviously very good. You'll find better elsewhere, but for a ""fast food"" burrito, the ingredients are solid, it leaves you satiated, and the taste is real. Come through.",2016-05-01 13:30:06

We did the tasting menu. The starter was a halibut sashimi in a ponzu like sauce. Typically, you wouldn't think of halibut as being the go to sashimi, but it was prepared perfectly and can't think of a better sashimi dish. The next course was a bento box with different small apps. Each one was better than the last. We especially enjoyed the oyster and uni. The third dish was a mushroom soup. It was phenomenal! The fourth dish was a ""cook your own"" wagyu. At first we were hesitant to do this, but once we realized how amazing this meat was we couldn't get enough. The final dish (and surprisingly the best) was a plate of nigiri. Every piece was perfectly done and SO fresh. This was the best nigiri we have found anywhere in AZ. For desert we had a custard with fruit that was the perfect ending to the tasting.

 In addition to being entirely too icy, my drink was served with the skinniest straw I've ever seen- combine those two characteristics and I couldn't really drink it. Taste reminded me of hazelnuts and was very light. Not sure whether flavor was diluted due to ice content or if it may have been made incorrectly.

I normally go to the one on Nellis and Stewart. They never mess my order up and they're really friendly. It wasn't till this month that I started going to this Wingstop location on Maryland parkway. Again food was great however the customer service I experienced had to be the worse I've ever dealt with in my LIFE!!! I placed my order through the app around 8 pm for pick up at 11:15 pm. I get to Wingstop at exactly 11:13 pm hoping for my food that I had order 3 hours ahead of time. I give Arcoiris my name and I let her know that I'm there to pick up an order. She then says ""we don't have anything under your name"" I  tell her I placed it over the app. She then knew what I was talking about and told me that order was scheduled to be picked up at 11:15 to which I said ""fine I'll wait a minute then"" it was then when Arcoiris realized she had fucked up and never placed my order. Even though she had the form right next to the register with a huge note that said place at 11 pm. So now I'm there waiting for my food like an idiot. I didn't get an apology or anything, not even a cup of water. Then once I finally had my food I checked it and  missing 3 rolls so I had to wait another 5 minutes by the time I left Wingstop it was 11:50. I was going to give them a bad review then but I figured I give them a second chance and I did yesterday and same shit horrible service I'm not even going to bother writing about it. All that matters which I find funny is that I learned that Arcoiris the girl who had fucked up my order a week ago is a supervisor!!! So she should of known better the first time.

1.  Style - The food is American and Hawaiian Fusion, which is a nice blend of Asian flavors more suited to the American Palate.  

2.  Ambiance - Very nice, relaxing setting, almost like resort style, with nice window views to the outside areas in Town Square. Very urban like.

3.  Service - Excellent! From the reception desk to the server, I found the service to be fun, relaxing, engaging, all at the right tempo / amount!

4.  Food - 

Appetizers - 

Had the Chicken Lollipop and this was pretty tasty with the Macadamia Nut and the Jerk dressing, although I am not a huge fan of the Jerk taste.  It is not as subtle to me in general. I love having the little drumstick lollipop style which is when they push the meat from the bottom to the top over the bone and it looks like a tootsie pop instead of a chicken drumette.  

Also had the Coconut Shrimp and this was very tasty, tender and very nice sizes as well.  

Seems that with all the appetizers, you can order in an entree size as well!

Food- 

Thai Shrimp and Scallops - Very light flavoring of Curry, with shrimp and scallops over a small bed of rice. The scallops were amazing and the shrimp was fine, it was way overshadowed by the amazingly tender and succulent pieces of scallop....

Lemongrass Ahi Tuna - The tuna was very lightly seared and very raw, which made for a really nice delicate taste / flavor.  Served on a bed of rice with Bok Choy Vegetables. The Bok Choy was nearly perfect, just a bit under cooked for my taste.  However, I do prefer slightly under cooked to overcooked, so this was acceptable to me

In uni I worked at the other french restaurant on this strip, Bodega. I am going to say, I prefer Bodega's food (and that's saying something great, because I ate it daily for a long, long time and never got sick of it!), but Cafe La Gaffe is pretty great, too. Decked out like a true Parisian bistro, Gaffe is oh-so cute. 

I've loved on their brunch omelettes served with a really well-dressed side salad, and most recently I enjoyed their soup du jour (split pea on a rainy day? you know it!) and their warm brie salad. I wasn't wild about the salad, but I didn't carefully read the description before ordering, so I won't bore you with that. The food is usually superb.

I booked an appointment for a pedicure on a weekday figuring that I would be in and out in no time at all. My appointment was for 11am and I arrived approximately ten to fifteen minutes early. There were only two customers in chairs when I arrived so I was sure my plan would work!

I was asked to select my colour and was immediately taken to the pedicure chair to soak. A few minutes later, the receptionist came back to offer magazines and coffee / tea. Thirty minutes later, with the water now cold, my technician finally attended to me.  

I explained my preferences to her (i.e. not using the razor, not cutting down the sides of my nails... I had this happen once before at a different place and I wanted to make sure that it NEVER happened again!). Apparently, they do a chemical peel instead of razoring which I found interesting.

While performing the calf massage the technician started to punch the heal of my foot... then my calf... and finally smacked the top of my foot. I'll assume that this was all part of the ""reflexology"" but honestly, I could have done without!!

Once the pedicure was done, I was taken to the drying station for approximately ten minutes or so.

At times, there were some language barriers with my technician but the long and short of it is, my pedicure is beautiful! You're even given a little bag consisting of pedicure slippers, a nail file and a buffer to take home and bring with you to your next appointment.

This nail salon is beautiful and clean. The service, although slow for this experience, was friendly and attentive. Where I usually have my nails done, they don't have massage chairs so it was interesting to give them a go.  I've decided that I don't like them! At all.

From start to finish, I was there for approximately an hour and a half... so much for my plan. When I was paying, I'm sure I heard the receptionist say that there was a 5% discount if I paid cash but from what I've read below, I'm wondering now if she said 15%, I knew I didn't have cash on me so I really wasn't paying attention.

And that'll teach me for not paying attention... they charged me 15% tax instead of 13% so watch out for that!",2012-07-04 12:42:32

There were 2 check out counter, 1 cashier was busy checking out a customer so I went to the other one with a male cashier. No customer in front of him and he was just scribbling, I unloaded my groceries from shopping cart, he didn't make eye contact, greet me or acknowledge me and before I finished unloading he walked away. Once I finished, I looked around and saw him on produce section talking to a customer. I did not wait for another minute, I walked away and left everything. That was the worst customer service I ever experienced, I never felt so invisible.

Will I go back to shop there? I don't think so. There are other Asian stores in the area, so I have options where I want to spend my money at.

I am truly disappointed, where did it all go wrong?!  I am a regular take-out patron of yours and what I brought home today was abysmal.  It really hurts me to write this, but management needs to get their hands out of their pockets.  What I found suspect was that SushiKiku.com has omitted the North York location from the website.  Intentional? or technical error?  Is every restaurant individually owned?  My gut feel is that this restaurant either changed ownership or changed the cook staff in the past few weeks and the quality of the food reflects the change.

Here's my review on the food.  The miso soup was like drinking warm water with seaweed floating around, flavorless.  The salad dressing is regular French dressing, I believe the grated ginger with French is no more.  The sushi rice recipe must have been altered, as the rice was crumbling into my soy sauce and had a dull taste, like it was missing sweet Mirin.  The sushi was packed and presented nicely, so it wasn't loosely packed rice.  Lastly, I always look forward to this dish for every take out, the tempura box.  The box just closes with two long pieces of hot golden crispy shrimp, on a bed of coaster sized yams, zucchini, eggplant, with a large floret of broccoli.  The absolute perfect pairing to the meal (see the pictures by others and you will know what I mean!).  But what I got was literally half the size.  Each and every item was one bite size, not the normal three bite size and it wasn't even the typical crunchy tempura I've always ate. 

Please new owners and new cooks, go back to the way it used to be!  You guys had the best and biggest bento boxes...now you're just comparable.  Why should I drive all the way to you for comparable sushi?  I will come back in a few weeks to order the same items and follow up with another review.",2017-08-22 02:16:16

There is a lovely bar area that opens onto a patio, with casual lounge seating and a gas fire pit. Watching the sun set and the mountains while enjoying a glass of VCP Champagne? Heavenly.

I had the chance to ray several salads - roasted beet, Caesar and spinach. All were fresh and flavorful but the winner was the roasted beet and I don't even like beets. I can't say I had ever had popovers either but the airy, cheesy delights served at BLT make me wonder why they aren't more popular. (They also made me seriously consider buying an overpriced popover pan from Williams-Sonoma)   

BLT is a steakhouse so I expected great things from the ribeye and was not disappointed - the steak was tender and juicy and served with a red wine reduction. We also sampled perfectly roasted chicken - a simple dish, but one few places do well. Pair it all with homemade dauphionoise potatoes and garlicky green beans - truly an outstanding meal.

I liked the simple decor - it was kind of rustic but chic at the same time.

The service was phenomenal.  I wish I remembered the name of our server - he was a softspoken gentleman with a really gentle voice.  ""Lets discuss the food in great detail"" he'd say, and I'd think, 'That's the kind of person I could be friends with!'  He spoke about the food with the same kind of reverence one would reserve for spiritual experiences, which I found to be lovely, hilarious, and endearing at the same time!  He was also very attentive and funny.  Excellent, excellent service.

The food was delicious!!!  We shared a duck poutine pizza and the fish cake with fries.  Sweetheart, who's a notoriously picky eater, said the pizza was the best he'd ever had.  The pieces of duck were juicy, flavourful, and generous.  I could've done without the fries, to be honest, but I don't think they took away from the dish overall either.  The gravy was unctuous and flavourful and rich and delicious.  The cheese was squeaky and toned down the saltiness of everything else.  And I loved how thin the crust was - thin and crispy, but not so thin that the middle could be raw or mushy.

The fish cakes (described to us as ""grown-up fish and chips"") were delicious.  We made the mistake of ordering two things with fries but it's ok.  The fish cakes were lemony and herby and sophisticated.  They were nice and tender but still able to keep their shape and not fall apart.  There were big, generous flakes of fish inside.  I kind of wish the order came with 2 instead of 3, but honestly, between both dishes, the two of us were stuffed!

And then the spiced pear juice - OH MY GOD, has any juice ever been more delicious???  I don't think so.  It was diviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.  It was sweet but not too sweet, spiced to perfection, had some fruit pulp in it...it was perfect.  I dream of that pear juice sometimes.  So peary!  

We are looking forward to going back soon!

My friends and I all opted for the four course tasting menu. It's definitely worth the $44, and we got to try each other's dish. Warning= one should probably come here with an empty stomach because the portions are pretty big. And by your fourth course, you will wishing you wore your more stretchy pair of jeans!

Firsts= Crispy Fried Lake Erie Smelts- I enjoyed the smelt, it was light and not too oily and the sauce added a little sweetness to it. 
Escabeche of Broccoli Salad- Was refreshing and the first time I've ever had pickles in my salad! If you aren't a fan of pickles or a slightly sour taste in your salad, I suggest you pick a different dish

Seconds=Hand Ground Beef Tartar- I'm not a big fan of raw meat, but since my friend loves tartar I gave it a try. It was actually quite good, and tasted quite fresh. And since I'm still alive to write this review, we can safely say that it was prepared well! :p I ate the beef without the relish and it was still quite tasty, especially on crispy toasted bread. 
Stuffed Semolina Pasta- I expected a little more from the dish, so I was surprised when two pieces of pasta came out. It was a little dry for my taste. 

Halfs= Pommes Frites= I liked the fries with rosemary and aioli sauce. It would be nice if they had multiple aioli sauces available though, just to kick it up a notch.
Gravy Frites= This is basically poutine, and I love poutine! I didn't even have to go all the way to Canada for it it either! ey!

Thirds= Roasted Pig Head- Totally worth every penny of the $44+ that I paid! The meat was so so so tender and marinated with an amazing sauce. This is definitely a diet buster, so ladies....just close your eyes and dig in because it's worth every extra mile you have to run! REMEMBER to tell your server ahead of time to start preparing the pig head for you, because it takes a while to cook.

I went here on a date with my man friend on a friday night. Although I am mildly familiar with Mt Wash this place was still hard to find. After we found it and valeted my go-cart we were greeted by a huge party at the door (general mayhem).  I love when restaurants are busy, loud, and hectic (I'm not much for quiet intimate dining). My date made a res which was clutch because this place was packed! 


We sat around 8:50 (our res was at 8:30) but we were in no rush and had fun talking to the large party waiting to sit. We were sat next to another large party this one was already a couple bottles of wine deep when we sat down (more on them later). 

The service was a tad on the slow side but the place was packed. The server Katie was really knowledgeable and funny. My date and I were joking around with her all night. She was also on point with all of the specials. 

We started with special zucchini app. Which was solid, nothing over the top. But a solid dish. I had a spicy shrimp dish and my date had the chicken romano. When they bought these dishes out his looked like a pizza because it was a HUGE portion of lightly breaded chicken in a round shape. Again this PORTION WAS HUGE!!!! It completely covered the plate. Mine was really good, spicy but good! I couldn't finish all of it. 

I think my favorite part of the meal was just the interactions between tables ( I think wine helps this). The large party next to us was a group of 12 65 year olds who went to high school together. They kept chatting with us all night. One guy came over to our table (bombed) and chatted with us for 20 minutes about complete non-sense... hilarious.  Then another table came over making fun of the bombed guy! Generally a lively dinner!

Az40MyutJCTG3fXe_urEUw,vbHlFP0Orx1mM5-uBqzYFg,wMIHcDnQXGTIVwBnIDRwGw,5,5,2,4,"Just returned from our first outing at the sparkling new Sun Valley 14 theater.  I don't have one negative thing to say about it.  There's plenty of parking, the building is lovely (even has a Fountain outside), the service was impeccable, the popcorn was tasty (and free since they are still celebrating their grand opening), the theaters are well designed, and the seats are SO comfortable.   (My husband commented that he wanted to take the theater chair home with him and my son said it was the most comfortable movie theater he has ever been in....and we have been in MANY move theaters!

For me, what really set this theater as a cut-above-the-rest is that since they are brand new, so are their screens, movie technology, and 3D glasses design.  (The 3D glasses are also coded so if you try to walk off with them, the scanner at the exit will detect it and set off an alarm...yes, the glasses are ""that"" nice!).  

We saw Spiderman in 3D and it was AMAZING!!!!  I generally detest 3D movies because I have trouble taking in the entire screen and the movement is bothersome....but not this time!!  There were a few first-person shots that make me look away  briefly because the motion bothered me a bit, but that was it.  Typically, I spend half of time in 3D movies, watching it with my glasses off or turning away from the screen during every action shot.  This is a huge selling point for me!  My son loves 3D movies so I will be taking him regardless, but if I can actually enjoy them now, too...bonus!!!!  

There were some other nice little details that are worth a mention.  There are cafe type tables in the first section of the theater.  This is a nice place to sit and chat while waiting for the movie to start.  They had fresh flower arrangements on the cafe tables and in the ladies room (see picture), the concession stand has self-serve butter topping, which I enjoy.  There a nice older gentleman at the door to wish us a good night and was handing out mints.  I don't know if they will continue to do this past the grand-opening honeymoon period, but it was a very nice touch!

The icing on the cake for me...the theater is only 10 minutes from my house.  That's only a few minutes less than Stonecrest, but I genuinely prefer this theater to Stonecrest for many reasons.  Stonecrest is always completely insane, especially on a Fri or Sat night and you need to get there an hour early just to make sure you can find a parking space and get your tickets and concessions before the theater fills up.  Although I envision Sun Valley getting busier once the word gets out that this place is so great, I hope that it will never become the manic nuthouse known as Stonecrest.  However, they are building up the area and putting a TGIFriday's next door, so I guess time will tell.

Looks like we have ourselves a new favorite theater!  :-)",2012-07-15 01:52:32

The task was to fix a refrigerator ice maker, which was leaking, producing rusty cubes, and finally had stopped working entirely.  I called Hillside and Leonard, the owner, came out the next day.  He told me it would cost about $500 to replace the rusted ice cube dispenser, replace the ice maker itself, and repair the leak.  I just might want to replace the entire refrigerator, he said, so ""call me back and let me know"".  We decided on the repair.

Two days later he had bought the necessary parts and returned with an assistant to do the work.  It ended up costing $287. [NOT A TYPO].  That in itself is remarkable.  The reason is that when repairing the leak he determined we didn't need a new ice maker, just the dispenser.  He could easily have installed the ice maker and I would never have known; now he had to return it, on his own time, and he would make nothing for installing it.  I think we call this ""honesty"" - Diogenes would be thrilled.

It doesn't stop there.  During the installation, he found that the leak had caused a section of wall behind the refrigerator to become moldy - possibly with black mold, which is no joke.  He could have made a bunch of money tearing out and replacing the affected area, but instead he told me that he had to research how to best do it while minimizing the danger from black mold spores both to himself and to my family.

1)Sour Dough crust WTF, who doesn't metion the crust taste like the most sour sourdough ever?

2) it actually tasted similar to Peter Piper Pizza

3).........................(dots equal drum roll) It was the size of large burger. Seriously it was about equal to 2  and a half normal slices. 

This pizza tasted like shit and for 10 dollars I can go to grimaldis and get an awesome pizza triple the size and quadruple the quality.

I frequent the one in Markham (Kennedy road/bur oak) and this place has the same menu do its consistent with what you'd expect from a pho place. Food under $10 with lots of options on pho and other items. 

Atmosphere 

I'd say it resembles a typical AYCE place in terms of seating. Fairly large dining room and waiting area which I hope means they get busy during key times. All of the key stuff on the table, including vinegars, sriracha, chili paste, soy and hoisin sauce as well as napkins, chop sticks and spoons. The older design has a ""greasy spoon"" vibe in a good way similar to other pho places on the west end and down town. 

Food

I'd you're craving it, it's good. It's typical of a pho place. I of course got the house special pho and was impressed with the combination  of beef, and still rare steak. Nice touch. 

A mis step if I had to say there was one was that the noodles were the dry kind and were smushed in a small bowl then added to the pho. It was a little tough to mix and get at. But given a few minutes they softened and loosened up. 

Kinda wish they had the option for flat noodles or fresh noodles too. 

All in all a good place to satisfy the pho craving, especially in the area.",2016-05-23 23:25:56

We got a hookah for the table and the hookah girl was around every ten minutes, which is really sad that she was so attentive and we couldn't order a drink to save our life. 

We had bussers (?) come around trying to take plates and glasses...and trying to grab them when we weren't anywhere near done. 

Oh and the bar lost my credit card twice, I had to go find the actual bartender I handed it to and ask for it back. 

So I give a good rating for the food and drinks, but the service was Horrendous. Awful.

Westgate has a AMC movie theater, large variety of restaurants, arts &crafts,  and specialty shops to choose from, and did I mention the Tanger Outlets are right across the street within walking distance.

If you have some time to spare; Westgate  is a great place to do it.",2014-11-24 18:05:33

This location is insides the Crystals @ Citycenter.  If you go to this location make sure to request to sit in the tree house (it's the giant wooden structure you see in the pictures), it's much more interesting then just sitting in the regular dining room.

The service was impeccable; water was always full, the plates and crumbs were constantly being cleared and the waiter was friendly.

Me and my wife shared the double cut porter house.  This thing was REALLY good, and was probably the best steak i've ever had at the time.  We were not even hungry and we ate half of it.   Took the rest to go and the next day i just straight up ate the leftovers straight out of the box (no fridge or microwave in the hotel room).",2011-08-14 16:46:29

Since we weren't there to watch the games, the place was too loud for my taste. The lady at the table next to me, who screamed profanity every time a play happened during the game, leads me to believe this may not be the place to bring children. However, I was impressed with all their screens and would consider going back during college football season to enjoy a game there. I'd also like to try hanging out on their patio during the warmer months.

Our server was pretty good, despite being very busy.

Wine prices seemed high for this type of pub, so I opted for a sangria, since I wasn't in the mood for a beer.

The chicken dumpling soup was good, and my fellow diner raved it reminded him of his grandmother's soup.

However, I was extremely disappointed in my pear salad. The menu said it was served on mixed greens, but all I got was some tasteless iceberg lettuce. I should have spoken up at the time and questioned my order, but I didn't, so in Brazwell's defense, I didn't give them the opportunity to correct this blatant error.

I will give them another shot, and look forward to providing an updated review at that time.",2011-01-24 17:28:43

We came in on a Saturday afternoon. Place wasn't even that busy. The staff didn't even greet us or sit us down on any of the 5 unclean tables that where empty. They didn't even bother cleaning up after the customers left until I asked them nicely. 
Then we where waiting about 20 minutes for the staff to take our order and then I lost patience and asked them to help us with our order. The Korean lady nodded and then nothing for another 10 minutes! They didn't bring out banchan (Korean side dishes) until after I asked them more than half way finished with the lunch. 
I looked around and other customers where fed up and leaving without even ordering. This is a joke. 
To owner of this place: read this and hire additional trained staff, the two older women working don't even know how to ring up the register correctly. 
The only reason we didn't leave sooner after the terrible service was because we purchased a Groupon and had no choice but to use it. Fortunately the food was decent.

The interior of Local is pretty nice looking.  I loved their menus (nerd) and seating arrangements.  Our service was quick and very friendly.  

I was inspired to order the Amazing Yoga Asparagus Salad with Salmon since it was named for my fave studio right across the street!  It was a filling salad with delicious grilled asparagus, other veggies and a bunch of goat cheese.  The salmon was cooked very nicely and I was impressed with the quality of the fish.  The best part of the salad, though, was the horsey vinaigrette.  Yum!  My husband got the cheeseburger with bacon (of course) and said it was ""good"".  So probably an average burger here.

Our waitress did make a mistake on our bill (charged for an extra beer that we ordered but they actually didn't have on tap), but when we brought it to her attention she was really apologetic and fixed it quickly and gave us both coupons for our next visit.

If you like Yellowtail, Nobu and such you might really like this place. This is Yellowtail's sister restaurant, in fact, opened up by Chef Akira Back. 

We had a tasting menu set for us, so we just let the ""omakase"" come forth and didn't question it. 

*Yellowtail, serrano chilies w/ ponzu - nice freshness of fish, good, but standard. 
*White Fish Carpaccio- it was a white fish I could not pin point but the menu says Hirame. I do like the crispy shallot bits in here to set off the fish. 
*Rock Shrimp Tempura - this was lightly battered then tossed in a mayo based spicy sauce. It's a bit spicy, sweet, savory and had nice crunch. Quite nice. 
*Crispy rice with tuna - This was nice texture play. Good fresh tuna, nice crunch from the rice, a bit of seaweed, a bit creamy and tangy sauce. 
*Crispy Calamari - I really loved this as they achieved a lightness in the batter that is hard to achieve. It's damn beautiful in fact when this subtle thing happens . The jalapeno, fish sauce and mint jelly was different of a sauce, but I did enjoy it. I could eat a basket to myself, but you know can't be a heathen. 

*Toban Filet - They do well with presenting it, coming steaming out a hole of the hot pot and then they unveil it at the table and pour a special soy. Very tender filet mignon and had shiitake and sea beans to accompany it. 
*Jidori Chicken - good as far as Jidori goes, but it was alright in the scheme of the dinner. It had more of a salty/savory sauce and with the rich puree and kimchee green beans I feel a tiny bit of acid might elevate and cut it to make it better. The crisp of the chicken and the juiciness was good though. 

*Hot Mess Roll - it was a crab roll topped with various fish like a poke and screaming O sauce. This was decent, but I feel it's weird a high end restaurant doesn't use real crab, but krab. 
*007 Octopussy - crab salad wrapped with cucumber, topped with spicy tako and crispies. This was a refreshing roll. I really liked the combination of the tako with the cucumber and creamy crab. 
*Crispy Pork Belly Roll - it's pork belly with skin and fat on topped with cole slaw and had a honey like sauce. This was different and the textures and flavors were lovely together. Great meld of crispy, soft, crunchy, creamy, salty, sweet. A favorite of the night. 

*Chocolate lava cake - very rich and good, needed more ice cream 
*Mochi (green tea, chocolate, vanilla) - definitely fresh made. Good, but standard. 

Service from our main server was friendly enough and our drinks kept filled. The bussers that brought food were rather fast though. They announced and left and there were a few times I had to ask ""Did you hear what they said it was?"" I just tasted it and figured it out myself and compared that versus the menu to know what dishes were had. It wasn't busy, homie you can slow your roll a little. The pace of the dishes though was fairly good. We had most things coming as we were consuming the last bits of something. It's a plus as I've been to dinners where the pace drags on. I can talk peoples heads off, but few people can commit to sit there for half a day.

This is not an all you can eat place so if you want quantity, try hawro down the block or gen in henderson. This place focuses on quality and its a kbbq place where the food is cooked in front of you but it's mainly cooked by the servers. Side dishes include a salad, a bean sprout slaw, Kim Chee pancake and Kim Chee. The meal also comes with one bean paste soup and one steamed egg. First course with brisket and they give you rice balls like nigiri style and you're supposed to put the cooked beef on top of the rice to eat it like sushi... Interesting. Never seen that before. The next course is a huge steak... Not sure what cut but maybe ribeye. The steak was really juicy. They didn't season it so you can dip it into the sesame oil salt or spicy sauce. It's really good when wrapped with rice paper. They also served veggies grilled and you're supposed to dip it into this pot of melted cheese fondue style. Last was the marinated short rib. That was really tender and and juicy. Flavor was great. At the end of the meal we ended with ice cream sandwiches in crispy rice crackers. The green tea flavor is the best I think. 

What I really like about this place is the quality of food. Top notch. Service was good.  They also had free water and slushies for customers waiting on the hot patio. 

I knocked a star down because in the middle of our meal the freaking vent fell onto the grill and fire and scared everyone. They changed our grill but continued cooking the piece of meat the vent fell on top of. They apologized but other than that there was no compensation.",2016-09-10 03:03:13

My husband thought the hostess at the front was kind of rude but I didn't notice that myself. I did notice that after we were seated, it took a LONG TIME for anyone to bring us menus or water. Yes, the restaurant was busy but there were about a million servers walking around so I am not sure why everything took so long.

We ordered our food, one small and one large plate per person which our waitress explained is not the thing to do here, as it is a ""shared concept."" Ok, every meal we have is a shared concept so whatever, bring the plates out however you want!

My watermelon and goat cheese salad with candied wasabi was YUMMY but I wish the watermelon had been a little more chilled. Warm watermelon... no thanks. This was honestly my favorite dish. I didn't care as much for the crab toast my husband ordered but it was decent.

Our large plates took about a million years to arrive. We just sat there and sat there and sat there. The waitress offered to get us some fries or something in between and it took SO LONG that I honestly feel that at any other restaurant that would be comped but maybe we didn't spend enough money to warrant special treatment. The fries with ""kim cheese"" sauce were not so great but we were hungry so we ate them. The sauce is waaaay too sweet and the fries are obviously frozen.

Large plates...  this is a hilarious misnomer because the pieces of fish are itsy bitsy. My husband's striped bass with edamame puree was honestly yummy. I kept stealing bites. My mahi mahi on onion jam with dill was totally blah. The fish had no flavor and the onion jam was cold so the whole dish quickly became a gross lukewarm.

Our waitress was honestly quite pleasant despite the restaurant's hiccups and mediocre food but overall I just felt ripped off. I'd like more food, more quality and more service (seriously, the length of time we waited between courses was outrageous) for the three-figure price tag.

I don't have any big complaints about the food, the service or the decor but I just wasn't feeling it.   First off, they did an amazing job on the space.  It's lovely, and they have a great outdoor patio to enjoy in the warm weather.  It's a large space but it was pretty dead during the lunch hour.  The restaurant wasn't even half full when we went for lunch, and Market Square restaurants are usually packed at lunch.

The menu was, in my mind, pretty limited for the average ""nonfoodie.""   Greek and seafood doesn't always have mass appeal and buying by the ounce for fish at market prices is pretty expensive.   I had the chicken shawarma sandwich for lunch, and it was tasty but I've had the same option at Madonna's and liked their cheaper version equally well.    I had the side of ancient grain pasta salad but didn't enjoy it as I found it a little dry and lacking flavor.

To be honest and almost embarrassed to admit, but a couple of weeks ago was my first visit to Red Rock.  I've don't Mt. Charleston plenty of times and Red Rock is my new favorite out here.  

This review is not for any of the specific hikes, just Red Rock Canyon in general.  My first hike here was with someone that hasn't hiked before so I made sure that we found somewhere easy to moderate. First impression of Red Rock is that it's beautiful.  You can see the red mountains and canyons from a distance in Vegas, but up close is where you see the beauty of this place. 

Yes, I'm a fan.  Actually, it's as good as it gets.  What I love about Red Rock is that you have a plethora of choices.  You can choose an easy, moderate, and even tough hikes.  It's up to you.  You can even uses Red Rock scenic route to bike, run, walk, or jog.  Red Rock is my excuse to get outside and get some exercise.  I have no excuse with fitness with Red Rock only about 25 minutes from my home.  

Parking is only $7 and immediately upon driving in there's a visitor's center, which I have to try next time.  My only issue with Red Rock is that some spots can get busy, especially with parking.  I noticed more Utah, Arizona, and California plates over Nevada plates.  In other words, can be a tourist spot which is fine by me.  The scenic route is one way so if you're unsure where to start your hike and drive by, there's no turning back (at least legally).  My advice, do some research or follow the map.  Make a decision and stick by it.",2013-01-12 07:38:02

All the trails are connected to one another along the 13 miles of scenic drive. The drive is a loop, so if you get lost, then you must've really done something wrong. 

Much of the hiking consists of scrambling amongst some very tiny rocks, so bring pants
and sturdy shoes. Some areas actually have waterfalls (small, puny ones).  Valleys are very picturesque ... and you might even spot interesting wildlife (tortoise!) 

If you've done 3, you've done a good number as they start to look a like.
We started out at Calico tanks (scramble scramble), then to a few overlooks, a  waterfall area. Each area has its own parking lot and bathroom -- which are nicely kept. 

To enter -- pay $7 at the entrance ... it's for all day and really worth it. 
They even have a visitor's center that has really nifty information and guides to help you on your way.

I've been to indian restaurants before and have always felt like I could have ate more of whatever I ordered. Here, I don't have to worry about that. I always leave full and satisfied. There's plenty of vegetarian dishes which is greatly appreciated. The food is amazing! I can never get enough of the sag paneer and the dish with cheese in it with some sauce, not sure what it's called but it's my favorite thing here. The owners are really nice people and have great customer service skills. They always make sure me and my girlfriend are taken care of. As soon as we step inside they start making our mango lassi's and nan bread. We don't even have to ask for it. I love it. There's no other restaurant that I would recommend more than this one. Everything about this place is awesome and leaves you wanting to come back everyday. There was a week where we actually came 4 times. If you're craving indian, this is the spot to go to! The desserts are pretty darn good here too. I get rice pudding and mix it with fruit custard and a few pieces of milk candy. Did I mention this place is affortable? It's 8 bucks per person and if you go as a family of three they might give you a special price if you ask them about it and go there often. The restaurant is always clean. They have a television that is always on either one or two things, indian music videos or WWE wrestling. I prefer the wrestling but the music videos are cool to watch when eating this type of food.

We ordered a 4-piece dinner knowing that it would be too much for the 3 of us, but we wanted a set with a steamed sea bass. In addition, we also ordered their fried pork chops. Obviously, this was too much food, and we ended up with about 3 pieces of the pork chop, some of the mushroom+bok choy, and about a quarter of the chicken left to take away. Our set came with 4 dishes - the steamed sea bass, 2 types of mushroom + bok choy, half a chicken, and a flavourful tofu dish. 

The tofu dish was the greatest surprise since we expected a rather bland and simple tofu dish, but what came out were about 10 pieces of deep fried tofu drizzled in a rich soy sauce, topped with tiny shrimp and surrounded by some broccoli. The fish was steamed perfectly so that it was cooked, but the meat was still very tender. A delectable and delicious surprise. Overall, their food quality was excellent and food portions were large. The set came with a starter soup and a final sweet soup dessert (with a choice of red or green bean) and 2 butter cookies (with dried cranberries and almonds) per person. Including tip, a 4-piece meal + an extra dish came out to be around $75, which was very reasonable considering the high quality and quantity of food.

Qlk2raxwJGiDERyzQgXaWw,8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,BQKPbuILIAG53XtIZ51s5Q,3,9,9,6,"Oh Tommy, oh Tommy, you have let me down!

I have been patiently waiting and waiting for a Tommy's up on my side of town.  I have been watching the countdown for the new store on Craig to open for months now.  I was so happy today when I saw on Facebook you were finally open.  My heart was all aflutter and I couldn't get over there fast enough to grab a ridiculously messy and oh so good chili cheese burger and fries.  And then it went downhill...

First, the location itself is tucked into a corner of a big shopping center.  There are only 3 parking spots near the restaurant.  Otherwise you have to park and walk across the entrance to the drive thru side which had a lot of cross traffic.  People were driving all sorts of crazy in this area, so be careful walking around here since there really isn't a clear path to walk on.

I actually had to do drive thru today because my kiddo had fallen asleep on the way over.  It is easy to get into the drive thru, but really tricky once you have picked up your food.  The driveway is very narrow and quite close to the building.  I drive a mid-size sedan and it was tight.  I feel bad for anyone is a big SUV or full size truck.  Pay attention or you might hit the wall.

Next, the order taker.  She was really quite friendly, but was on the pushy side.  I needed a second to review the board to know what to order for my daughter to eat later.  I asked to have a minute to check the board.  I think I got maybe 15 seconds before she was asking if I was ready to order yet.  There wasn't a line, so I am not sure why she was in such a rush.  

I went ahead and ordered and then she asked if I wanted to upsize my drink for an extra $.50.  I said very clearly, ""No thanks"" to which she said ""Ok.""  I assumed that meant I would getting a regular sized drink, silly me!  I get up to the window and she hands me a large soda, which I was totally charged for, so it wasn't just a mistake by whoever was serving up the sodas.  I told her I said a regular and she said she thought I said to upsize it.  I wasn't in the mood to argue, so I just took the drink.  I mean I love soda and can easy drink 2 liters in no time, but I am trying to be good and cut back on my soda addiction.  So much for that!  It was just fishy, in my opinion.  I don't know if the girl really made a mistake or wanted to improve her up-sell totals.  So watch out for that trap.

Next was my burger order.  I ordered a regular chili cheese burger.  I specifically asked to have no onions because they are yucky.  The girl told me that they only put onions on burgers if you request them.  I said great and to please keep them off of my burger.  So you can imagine my surprise when I got home, having been drooling over the burger next to me for the last 3 miles, and then took a big bite into my burger that was covered with ONIONS.  Ugh.  I have never seen so many onions, it was almost like i got an extra helping of them.  Fun times for sure.

So after I took a bite into my onion infested burger, I had to take a big swig of my giant soda to wash the onions down.  Guess what?  The soda mix was totally off.  I mean the place had been open for 2.5 hours by the time I was there.  How was the soda to syrup mix already goofed up?  So yes, I paid extra for gross soda.  

On the positive side, the burger was super tasty (once I picked all of the onions off) and smothered in delicious Tommy's chili and cheese.  The fries were simply amazing! I have no shame, so I scrapped all of the extra chili cheese off of the paper they were wrapped in. Yummmm, cheese paper.... If you haven't tried a Tommy burger, you really need too!

I still love Tommy's, even after all of the messes listed above.  I am giving this location the benefit of the doubt and giving them 3 stars.  It is their opening day, so maybe everyone is working out the kinks.",2013-09-25 21:37:13

Personally though, I've been there a few times and never saw anyone playing pool. If they got rid of all the tables but one and moved that one to the front left corner, they could make that large wood floor space a dancefloor, bring in a deejay and have a booming nightlife there as well as good food. 

That floor space is also large enough to host live local music. 

They seem to hold the service to a high level too as our waitress was excellent the first few times we came and then when our server changed things changed a bit as well.

The 10 of us enjoyed the locals' discount (20%) and half-off bottles of wine which reduces the 300-350% wine menu markup to a more local-friendly 70% :)

Had six Beausoleil oysters ($4 each), albeit on the smaller side (RM Seafood attracts larger specimens). I had a Ritz-cracker-crab-stuffed Lobster Tail ($25) add-on to my steak entree which I definitely wouldn't order again. It was a small tail, from a 1lb-ish lobster, and I found the stuffing too sweet, too pasty, and lacking any visible crab. The tail is one of those $5 tails you see at the fishmarket, so it isn't a screaming value. The creamed Spinach is still tasty as usual.

Be warned that the 24oz. Tomahawk bone-in Ribeye is easily 12oz. of bone. The bone was enormous, almost a foot-and-a-half long. If you're planning on sharing this steak, it's not a ton of steak. On top of this, some the fat weight on the Ribeye cooks off so you end up with maybe 10-11oz. of actual meat. From a distance it makes for a great Instagram, but if you're looking to eat like Fred Flintstone, pick a different steak. (maybe the Brooklyn Filet instead?)

We asked for a few separate checks, and I can understand an included gratuity on parties of 6 or more (we were 10). But service was on the lame side - almost European-like. We had one server in charge of our table the entire meal, and she would disappear for 7-8 minutes at a time which was odd because the restaurant was really empty that Wednesday night. In example, only one tray of steak sauces was left in our vicinity (good for one or two persons max) and short of actually getting up to ask the manager, I was left no option to ask for additional sauces (worcestershire & ketchup, yeah that's how I roll) before my Ribeye would've gotten cold. 

When the checks come, everyone is hit with a 20% included gratuity. Which is kind of a mind-fuck because that is the same amount as the locals' discount. Ha!

It's a nice environs - might good for a business dinner / expense account kind of thing. 
Rather low on the value scale. Service was far from spectacular. The people we were with made it fun, but shit - this ain't summercamp. We just spent $1000+ up in here!",2013-09-21 18:12:57

To my surprise, it arrived on Thursday. Hooray. The pick-up location was not easily identified because there were too many orange signs at the store advertising for the service, but was confusing to the customer actually looking for it. Finally, I asked a greeter who told me that it was behind the toys department. When I got there, there was no one attending the counter. I read the instructions and pressed the button, There was a check-out screen that said touch to get assistance. Why they had 2 systems, I am not sure, but I covered my bases. 6 minutes later, I was helped. All checked out, and my daughter now has her computer. Price was good, service okay.

Absolutely great wine store, but indifferent service and consistently mediocre food in the restaurant, IMO.

Last time there I had the lobster salad on a croissant that could have been from the Albertson's bakery (or it was just premade, and refrigerated so long that it was cold and stiff and had zero taste, like one from the supermarket.)  

This time it was quiche, just about the size of a large beverage coaster and maybe 3/4"" high at the most. Just a couple of bites - mostly crust and barely any filling to savor.  Hate to say it, but if Alex Stratta approved this quiche, he should be embarrassed.

Wine pour was skimpy.  Generally ignored after food arrived, no refills on drinks til you flag someone down. (Lots of attention to the bigger tables though - bring a group if you come and maybe the experience is better?)  Bread was good, and the view is nice.

It was crowded at 11:00PM, we took that as a good sign. We were sat right away since most of their tables were finishing up. 

We opted for the AYCE option, at about $25/PP that's a decent price for us. We started with some nigiri and apps- -  I always order ikura (salmon roe) and my husband orders amaebi (sweet shrimp). The waiter mistakenly brought me over an order of  ika (squid). Honest mistake because I do have a Jersey accent and both words sound the same. I tried it  since it was AYCE, but really didn't like it. It was really tough like old bubble gum. The ikura came out after a few minutes, and it was good, not great though. it was very briny and almost too fishy. My husband said the sweet shrimp was very tasty. The salmon, garlic tuna and green mussels were good. All cut extra thin, but we expect that from local AYCE spots. 

We both tried their Spicy yellowtail handroll, it was really spicy and delicious. Not too much rice and the fish was rolled to the very bottom of the handroll. 

The hurricane roll (Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaise) was icky. It was drowning in mayo. I didn't see that at first, so my first bite was brutal. It's $13.45 on their regular menu. That's not $13 quality. The mayo to roll ratio was overwhelming. I scrapped it all off, while the waiter watched. It was the worst part of dinner. And to think-- that's one of their ""special rolls'. yikes. 

The Orion roll (Spicy tuna and cucumber wrapped with cajun albacore drizzled with garlic sauce) pretty good, not overly impressed though. The cajun seasoning was barely there and the albacore was paper thin. 


The Tempura icecream had soggy/raw tempura around it, It wasn't cooked long enough so that resulted in a sloppy and unappetizing mess. 

With sake and two AYCE the bill came out to $80. The price is good but I'm not sure if we will return.

This place is very dim, very intimate and comfortable to be in. The tables gets occupied pretty quickly as the night progresses. One thing that I am really impressed with was the quality of their tables (perhaps new tables...? Since one of my friends is a regular here and he said they did renovations...)! 
The table we played on was flawless. The moment you hit that ball, it rolls smoothly across the table... it was just nothing compared to the other billiard places that I've played at! If you're a fan of pool or just an amateur player (like me, haha) then you've found the right spot! I believe it was around 8-10 bucks an hour. We stayed for almost 2 hours and the bill came up to around $20. Pretty cheap when you have a group; $20 split between the four of us was only $5 bucks each!!!

Stopped for lunch with a friend. Only stopped in because of the location and our time frame. The beer was fine, not as cold as it should have been. I didn't eat, but my dining partner did. He ordered some sort of chicken sandwich with avocado. It was dry, to the point where it was just not edible - so returned it.

Ordered the City Smoke Chicken wings for $5. They were served hot and tender. They were accompanied by blue cheese and 'Devil's Butter'. Def worth the $5, but not exactly the greatest wings Ive ever had. 

For my entree I ordered Kansas City Slathered ribs. The half rack was $13, the full was $19. The ribs were def tender and moist. I got Mac-n-cheese and baked beans as an appetizer. I dunno, for some reason I wasn't a fan of the Mac-n-cheese. They did something funny with the cheese, didn't taste like something grandma would make. The baked beans were up to standard.

3 stars for the massage I got from Crystal. 

First, I didn't like how the receptionist handled my request to reschedule the morning of. Don't get me wrong, I get massages regularly and I understand how important it is to be on time. My appointment was at 4pm, and I had asked when she called to confirm at 10am if it was possible to either reschedule for 4:30 or move it to another day- I was told told a resounding no, I was the last massage for a certain therapist and she was scheduled to go home at 5. Alrighty then..

I ended up making it to the appointment and received an unconventional (for me) deep tissue massage. She was able to get into my hip flexors and jaw, which were pretty painful and felt strange. I try to get monthly massages to relieve tension on my back, and even though we discussed problem areas she spent a lot of time on my chest and hips. It's been almost a week since the massage and I already feel like I need another massage to loosen up my lower back again. She was a very likable therapist, but the massage was mostly painful and wasn't very relaxing. She offered to extend my massage to 90 minutes, and I told her about the debacle with the receptionist, and Crystal tells me that she would have welcomed the push to 4:30 since it would have kept her from running the 10 minutes late to my appointment. UGHH!!

The spa lobby looks like a little gift shop. I'm not sure how else to describe it; there are books and cosmetics for sale, even as seen on TV items. The rooms don't really have any sound proofing so I'm glad I wasn't close to the entranceway, and also only had light curtains so they were really bright- which I didn't care for at all.

PROS:
I learned a lot about where I held tension from Crystal.
You can shop for last minute gifts in the lobby. :P

CONS:
Still holding tension in my lower back.
Rooms are bright, and not very relaxing.
Receptionist wasn't accommodating. 

All in all, if they offered a monthly subscription like most other spas do, I wouldn't buy it. I would never give this spa any sort of payment up front in case I needed to reschedule, and I'm not sure that the type of massage was ""for me"".",2014-06-09 15:34:48

I don't know diddly squat about comic books but my 5 year old wanted some Marvel ones after one of his friends got some. After looking at Yelp and seeing 4 1/2 Stars for Action Comics they made my short list of places to check out. And after one visit here I never made it to anywhere else....I didn't need to. 

When I walked in it didn't take long until one of the staff was coming up to help me. He showed me how the store was layed out and how to find what I was looking for. He even took a few minutes and helped me go through a couple of the boxes and quickly helped me locate what I was looking for. After that I took a few more minutes to look around...and I liked what I saw. 

The center of the store has tables setup for board games...and I saw quite a few different games in progress. I asked a couple of questions about one of the games...which I learned was Warhammer 40K and I got friendly replies...no attitude at all and they got me interested in learning more about the games. 

As I walked around the store I have to admit it's packed around the edges...but that's part of what makes this place so appealing. They've got a lot of good stuff in there. When it comes time to check out I didn't have to wait very long, and again the service I received was great. I had questions about stuff I saw in the display cases on my way out and the staff was quick to answer. I love service with a smile...it wins me over every time. 

I like this place, I will be back, but I'm glad I don't have time to get pulled into Warhammer 40K because it really looks like fun.

If you're hiking, biking, boating or fishing as most East Mesans do, you're sure to pass this place on the NW corner of Power and McDowell, which isn't too far from the Tonto National Forrest and the Salt River.  I swear they pump out heavenly kitchen smells every evening to draw in unsuspecting, hungry drivers.  It works.  

The restaurant is right off the street facing South on McDowell.  It's a hop, skip and a jump to a Starbucks (that's 100 paces) and has a nice porch with misters for the summer months.  However, you won't be craving Starbucks afterwards because ""The Brew"" as we call it really pushes the fluids.  

CAUTION: If you're bringing someone who has trouble with balance or is disabled or if you are trying to decide which heels to wear when visiting, just note that the floor surface tends to be quite slippery.

I'm not sure in which category the cuisine would be placed, but I'm going to say it's probably predominantly Italian American.  I say that because of the dishes, the pizza selection and sauces used and because this is the one place in Arizona where I would order a Cannoli.  

Real, authentic Cannoli are illusive things.  They can either be filled with cream or custard or Riccota or a combo, which I prefer.  There should really be chocolate pieces and Italian cinnamon and maybe a couple Maraschino cherries inside.  The shell should be crisp and have a certain doughy cinnamon flavor, but not overpowering.   I don't go for adding alcohol or bits of dried fruit, but that would be an authentic version as well.

Red, White & Brew offers the custard/creme Cannoli with chocolate chips inside (no cherries except for one on top) and the shell is 100% authentic with the Italian cinnamon flavor.  It's something to split with your date.  It's rich like cheesecake and goes quite well with an after dinner coffee or spirits.  I'd jog in place for an hour for one of these, is all I'm sayin'.",2008-10-04 17:47:43

We had a decent size group- about eight people.  They brought us all out miso soup, on the house (not sure why, but I'm not complaining) which turned out to be your standard miso soup.  We eventually all were able to order, and our server never confirmed our order with us, just whisped away with the sheet.  Quite a few people were having adult beverages, and the waitstaff was not quick on the uptake of actually getting these to our table.  Waters were also left unattended frequently.

I wouldn't have minded the experience so much, but about half of the table got their rolls a good 15-20 minutes before the other half did.  I realize we were a big group, but a 20 minute gap between serving everyone's food?  Pretty unacceptable.  My spicy tuna roll was nothing special, but I was starving by the time I got it, so it went quickly.

On another note, for some reason, Tomo is allowed to charge 10.3 sales tax (I'm pretty sure it should be 8%).  I had a different experience than another reviewer down below- they were just fine with splitting up the bill as long as we wrote down amounts with each specific card.

Given the locale and demographics, they're only open mornings and early afternoon until 3 pm. On the bright side, they're open on weekends too, for those in Vegas for weekend trips.

I love pesto, so when I saw the pesto grilled sandwich listed, I knew I had to order it. You get your choice of chicken and bacon or eggplant. Of course, I picked chicken and bacon. The sandwich is so good - my favorite part was the bread. Haha. 

The croissants had been freshly baked, so I also got the croissant and egg with turkey. The croissant itself was flaky and buttery. Definitely my favorite part of this item. Both the croissant and egg and the grilled sandwich came with a side of salad.

BF ordered the drip coffee. For 16 oz., it came in this huge mug, with separate containers to add cream and sugar to taste. A nice complement to our sandwiches.

There's indoor and outdoor patio seating. We opted outside because indoors was a bit warm (from the baking and cooking, maybe?), but outside had its challenges as well because the wind picked up and wrestled with our loose napkins and paper. Other than the blustery breeze, the outdoor patio seating would've been great during a normal sunny day.

The food experience so far would've been 5 stars, but we also got some pastries to go since the food was so good. We ordered two fresh croissants, a chocolate croissant, and the chocolate twist. I read rave reviews for the chocolate twist so I was excited to see it in stock. We took it to go to later enjoy in the hotel room. While the croissant was fresh and delicious, the chocolate croissant was okay, and the chocolate twist was the disappointing one of all. It must have been sitting in the display case for a reason because there was white stringy things on the chocolate part of the twist. I thought it was crystallized sugar but it wasn't. Ended up tossing the twist in the trash since it wasn't salvagable. =/

Upon walking into the studio, you see all the pieces lined up on the right and you immediately want to just pick each one up for a closer look, but you can't and you shouldn't because the oils from your fingers does something to the unpainted pottery.  

I took my goddaughter and friend's daughter here.  Both are around 5 years old, so I was a little worried it might be too advanced for them, but the lady who was working (I can't remember her name but maybe it was Gail?) was so friendly and helpful, I really didn't have to do anything but supervise.  The two girls picked out their pieces, then the lady went over everything with them and helped them pick their paint and get them set to start painting.  Once they were done, she helped them with some of the small details like eyes and painting their names on their pieces.  

We had a ton of fun and the girls did a great job at painting.  The only downside is that you have to leave your pieces there and pick them up at a later date, but that's okay. it just prolongs the gratification for the girls of having created something.

Yea, it was a while ago, but it was such a positive experience, and I'm doing my Vegas reviews right now, so I wanted to share my recollection (as I simultaneously browse through pics of that weekend)

I'm gonna do bullet points for this review:
- Lobby = quietly elegant, and there is a grand piano at the lounge area
- Bed = comfy, but the details elude me
- Room = soft yellow/gold tones, spacious, and with a kitchenette that includes a microwave. Oh, and there's a couch your leech of a buddy can sleep on too.
- View = decent one of the strip, though you are actually a block away from the center, so it's not the best
- Bathroom = there's a TV built into the mirror! And the shower was, at the time, the biggest I've ever been in -- I remember I could imagine myself in it with 4 more girls easily!  Unfortunately, in reality, I had myself a nice shower before soaking in a bubble bath.

I'd definitely stay here again if I was aiming for a nice, quiet getaway in Vegas.  It's close enough to all the action on the strip, but don't try walking back to the hotel from TAO -- it's farther than it looks.  Another reason it's so quiet is because there's no casino.  If you want to be where all the young, loud, drunkenly crazy, and hopefully half naked girls are, don't stay here.",2010-08-30 17:34:26

This restaurant always takes me to my happy place. I have yet to find a better place that does Kabobs as well as this one in the GTA. 

We came on Easter Sunday for lunch and as always, this place was busy. This restaurant is located in the Burger King and Mandarin plaza in the corner of Hurontario and Matheson. There's plenty of parking available even if it's busy. Similar to other Kabobs places, it's a cafeteria style in which you order and pay first, and then pick up your order. First come, first serve in terms of seating. There's sufficient amount of seating but it can get tight when it's busy. The good thing is that there's three registers serving customers. 

The Good: The food is on point. In terms of taste, there's no equal. We had the Tandoori Chicken, Beef Tikka and the Wazeri. All dinner size along with the Naan. Big serving portion and the Naan was hot and delicious. There's a jar of tap water available along with cups if you don't want to get drinks. They give you the tzatzaki sauce but ask for the hot one too. It's not really hot. 

The Bad: The waiting is a minimum of 20-25 minutes. Also picking up your order is a bit hectic as the orders do not come in the order of your number. As soon as the food is done, your number gets called. So people who placed their order later might get their food before you. 

Overall, that's a small price to pay for some amazing Kabobs. 

Highly recommended! 

P.S.  They have another location now and it's supposed to be bigger.

I got perch with fries, slaw, apple sauce and a slice of Oreo cheesecake for around 14 bucks. In about ten minutes. Fish was a little ""Erie"", but otherwise a good portion.

1.) Their not-on-commission staff doesn't follow me around asking me pointless questions.  

2.) Their 30 day no-questions-asked return policy gives you a sense of security on large purchases. I've bought and returned many things because I didn't like them or decided said item is a waste of money. 

3.) While I don't always buy the extended warranty, the last time my camera fell apart it was a life saver. Since my model was out of stock, they gave me full store credit for the price of my camera with no fuss. Again, no questions asked.

Also, I'm a sucker for yellow and blue.

Obligatory Title Pun: BEST for BUYing 'tronics.

Menu Readability: What is this? A restaurant?

Need to Mention: They price match Futureshop and the two stores have similar stock. ALWAYS check there before buying something. Just go to wherever's more expensive to save 10%.

It doesn't take much more than some nice meat on some nice bread to make an out of this world sandwich.

To season your sandwich, simply salt and pepper the meat, and that's it. You get all the zing you need from glazing the sauteed vegetables with a little steak sauce added right to the pan.

But realistically, it would have been hard for me to eat all of it even if there had been more, so I guess it's not a huge deal.

The broth here is pretty good. Not oily, very flavorful. It was a bit on the salty side though and the broth was murkier than I remember them being. However, it did not taste bad at all.

Side note: I forgot to ask, but there *might* (keyword) be a possibility that the broth has MSG in it. If you have reactions, you should ask because the broth tasted like it was possible that there was some in it.",2013-12-15 19:20:38

First, this place doesn't pretend to be something its not.  It is not as ritzy as the Lemont or somewhere similar, so if that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed.  My wife and I are both too loud to enjoy places like that anyways.  However, we do enjoy good food and a good atmosphere.  We like places that have bar food, but sometimes want something a little better.  This place is perfect for that.  

Another one of my favorite things about the place is how diverse the menu is.  It is rare to find a place that has a menu with both a $12 sandwich and a $50 steak.  Whether you want a juicy steak or a simple sandwich, everything is prepared wonderfully and tastes great.  Some of my favorite things to get here are the buffalo chicken dip, buffalo chicken sandwich, grandview burger, Crab sandwich, and the ribeye filet.  I have never been disappointed with any meal here.

On top of the great food, you cannot beat the atmosphere, especially in the summer when the decks are open.  The views are amazing and make for a great experience.",2017-11-14 17:24:59

We had been to some of the local shops around east Mesa and we had terrible luck with them. A friend suggested Crawford's even though it would be some distance away. We were desperate and decided to give them a try, which we had a good experience and tacked their business card on my fridge.
Last April, my hubby decided my '04 Chevy Impala needed an overhaul and went to Crawford's for a quote. Basically, we wanted to get all things worn out and unsafe  replaced. Jeff and Brad gave us a detailed quote, then grouped the items into ""Now"" and ""Could be later."" We went ahead with most of the ""Now""items and after 2 weeks  had them complete with the ""Later's.""  
A week after the repairs, we took a road trip to TX, 1400+ miles round trip. My Impala was smooth and quiet, with better fuel efficiency. It used to get 22mpg, during the trip it was consistently at 29-30mpg. We were very impressed with the outcome!
Then last week I needed to get an oil change, since I did not have anyone to give me a ride from Crawford's, I went to a local shop by the mall. I figured I could walk back from the mall to pick up my car once it was done. 
As I was picking up my car, I was informed I should have the car's plenum gasket, intake manifold runner gasket changed and power steering fluid flushed. All for $900+. 
Shocked, I went over to Crawford's to get a 2nd opinion... No, I do not need any of these repairs. There was no sign of leak and my power steering fluid is fine!
They saved me $900+.... and they did put my car on the lift and took the time to check it. They did not make up a story about fake repairs I need; they were honest and told me my car was ok. 
What can I say?! It might be a drive for me to take our cars to Crawford's, it might be a pain to arrange for rides to and fro. But I love an honest mechanic, and since we have found TWO at Crawford's, we will always go there!",2014-07-04 00:36:59

My first experience at Riddle Room was for the escape room. We chose the doctors room as our first room and it was fantastic! It is unique in many different ways. Without giving away too much, I was extremely impressed with RRs dedication in building some of their intricate puzzles. Also unique in that the door you come in from is not necessarily the door you go out through ;) Definitely makes the experience feel a lot more like I'm actually escaping. They also boast a photobooth with props where you can take four pictures which you can email to yourself and post on social media which my friends and I loved. We went on the weekend though so it was slightly pricey. $25 with tax makes it around $28 ($20 for Mon-Thurs). This was largely why I was going to give this place a four stars but upon my 2nd visit I have changed my mind. (Also, you can play boardgames for as long as you want after the esc rooms too so the price can be justified to an extent) 

What also surprised me was the size of the venue. They have a separate space for the escape rooms and the board game cafes. A surprisingly large space for a downtown location. They also clearly invested a lot here. At the booths you get a tv screen and you can ask the staff to plug in a variety of consoles ranging from the n64 to the wiiu (they even have the NINTENDO POWER GLOVE). They also have a still expanding selection of board games. Since they are relatively new, all the games are in perfect condition with multiples of the popular games so you don't have to compete with other guests for desired games.

What really won me over were the drinks and the staff. They have paninis and snacks, which were good but nothing exceptional. The drinks though had beautiful latte art that maintained its form as you drink it and did not rely on sweetener and flavouring to be delicious. 

Staff were also great. There's no time limit and not once did the staff act like we were overstaying our welcome, nor were we pressured to keep buying things to make up for the time we spent there. They check on us for water, and everyone were extremely friendly and thrilled to help us make the most of our visit.

Definitely will return and highly recommend!",2015-06-29 04:08:58

Gord love love loves black bean soup and ordered one.  He said it was the best black bean soup he'd ever had.  I had a taste and it was good (I'm not a big soup eater).  It had a bit of a bite.

Gord also ordered a Cuban Medianoche.  They make the buns in-house and they were really soft and delicious.  He said it was a good sandwich and he'd get it again.

I ordered beans and rice and a Chicken Medianoche (without avocado) ... the bun was soft and the chicken was tender.  Both were really good and I'd get them again.

It was a mushroom Alfredo sauce with a lot of cheese. Don't get me wrong I'm a cheese lover but I felt the cooking was played safe.

The price kind of blew me away because we were charged $80 just for the seafood platter. 2 little lobster tails, about 8 shrimps, 2 fried fish fillets, 2 mussels. Definitely not worth it for that price I would've thrown in some crab legs to justify that price.

Scott got red curry I believe with chicken and I took a bite and it was rather good. It was oddly more spicy than mine even though he got less spice level.

It was a pleasant evening weather-wise, so we opted for a dining venue nearby with outdoor seating and this place did the trick.

Our server, Steve, was excellent and not only gave us drink and food suggestions as first-timers, he also gave us some nearby tips for us as newcomers to Pittsburgh, as well.  

We decided on a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza with Paul & Young Ron (Meatballs, Sausage, Hot or Sweet Peppers & Ricotta Cheese) on one half and Fresh Mozzarella Sliced Tomato & Basil (No Sauce) on the other half.  Note to self and others:  the hot peppers per my husband were very hot; I've not seen him turn down something hot before but after one pepper he had had enough.  I, not into the hot peppers, didn't even try them.  But, otherwise, the pizza selections were very tasty.

Steve even gave us a freebie of some chicken wings topped with carmelized onions.  They were quite good and I'd order them the next visit for certain.

To top it off, I ordered a sangria filled with apple pieces and my husband ordered one of the beers our server suggested.  We were both pleased with our selections.

Oh, and have to mention a few items of note (more for me than others):  While heading back to the restrooms, a picture caught my eye -- it was Muhammad Ali from my home state of KY.  And other KY connections were to soon follow.  as I entered the women's restroom, there were hunky men's pictures all around.  And, yes, there were George Clooney and Johnny Depp, again KY men.  There were other gorgeous men's photos, as well, it's just that the KY men caught my attention first.  What has that got to do with a restaurant review, you ask?  Not a thing, but it did add to my delight which is part of the total experience.",2014-05-31 03:17:21

The drinks were the part that I enjoyed. I had a glass of wine but I did see some cocktails I would like to try in the future.

My uncle ordered a bloody mary and it was served as a build your own bloody mary station. It had the alcohol, tomato juice and different toppings separated so you could make it as you see fit. I thought it was really awesome and would try that if I came back.

Came here with some of my co-interns for dinner. I've had Ethiopian food a good number of times in various cities across the U.S., and it appears that Merkato is only one of several Ethiopian restaurants in Las Vegas. We picked this one due to its Yelp reviews and location (relatively close to work), as well as the fact that one of my co-interns thought Merkato sounded like meerkat and meerkats are cool (true story).

As soon as I walked inside, I noticed the intense smokiness (from burning incense). It was tolerable for me, and definitely transports you to another world, though I can see how it might be off-putting for some. There is also a small sitting area set up for the ""coffee ceremony"" (costs $20 per group according to the menu). I've never seen coffee ceremonies offered at any other Ethiopian restaurant, but it seems to be a thing in the Ethiopian places in Vegas, so maybe one of these days I'll shell out the money and participate in one. We got to peripherally experience a coffee ceremony during our meal since another party ordered it.

The interior is simple and the location of the restaurant overall is in a somewhat run-down plaza. The decorations were appropriate but not as comprehensive as some other Ethiopian places I've been to. 

Service was okay. It took a while to flag servers down to place our orders and ask for our bill, but we were checked on occasionally and the servers were pretty friendly and smiley whenever they interacted with us (one server was noticeably friendlier than others). 

As for the food, I thought it was quite good, though I've had better. The value is pretty great since most menu items were cheaper than I've seen at Ethiopian restaurants elsewhere, and the portions are fairly substantial. I ordered a veggie combo and dulet, and the veggie combo came with quite a few different items. Dulet (one of my favorite Ethiopian dishes) is not always on the menu at Ethiopian places, so I was ecstatic to see it on the menu here. 

The number one reason for me docking half a star off my rating is that they tried to sell us all water bottles when we asked for water. They do have tap water but you have to ask specifically for tap water. In addition, when we paid for our check with credit card, they entered zero in for our tip and said we had to tip with cash since ""they can't enter tip with chip cards."" I eat out frequently and am fairly certain that is a false statement; I feel like they just wanted cash for tip for bookkeeping reasons and/or to minimize credit card merchant transaction fees. Nevertheless, they were willing to split our bill six ways, so I'll give them credit for that.

Overall, a solid Ethiopian restaurant, but I'll probably check out some of the ones closer to home the next time I'm in the mood for Ethiopian.",2016-07-09 06:16:01

Although Jim is familiar with how Asian hair should be cut, and has a good technique, the language barrier for English-only customers is basically unworkable.  Even with a picture of the length and hand gestures indicating the length and angle of the cut I desired, I ended up with a  crooked style that is a solid 5 inches shorter than what I had requested. Some of this is my fault, because he had to go back and cut it THREE additional times in order to give me the shape I had originally sought. Plus, if I had made an appointment instead of doing a drop in, the translator might have been available AND, I had made the mistake of bringing a photo of the length I wanted, and I think Jim may have thought that was the exact cut and style I wanted. However, these would not have been problems if I spoke more Korean or Jim spoke any English. 

Still, it's a cozy and friendly salon and Jim and his assistant give a great shampoo. The last cut grew out well, but hung a little ragged for the first 2-3 weeks. Jim has a tendency to cut more than requested, so definitely emphasize the length you're looking for.

Here on a weekday and later in the afternoon - about 3:30pm it was about 3/4 full.  I can only imagine on the weekend that this place must be hopping so definitely try to get here on a weekday at on off time.

The brunch/lunch menu had my mouth watering - everything sounded so delicious but as soon as I saw the mac & cheese I knew that is what I had to get.  And boy am I glad I did!  It was tiny bursts of flavour explosions in my mouth - it had mushrooms in it, all this delicious gooey cheeses that provided a beautiful bite without being heavy.  The top was all gorgeous and crispy - I literally savoured every bite and scrapped the dish clean!  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back.  It was a tad bit on the salty side but I can forgive that.  It comes with a small salad that has pine leaves in it that gives it a nice finish - it;s also lightly dressed which I totally appreciate as I find most places douse their salad with dressing and it just ruins it.

With a glass of vino, and some tea afterwards this really hit the spot.  The mac & cheese was $20 - yes a bit pricey but I'd get it again and again and again.  I made the mistake of ordering a 6 oz glass - that alone cost me $12.  A rip off but oh well.  You learn.  

Service was a bit slow when I entered - you wait to be seated but I felt like I was a bit ignored for a few minutes but I'll let it slide because I just loved my meal here.

You can definitely tell they just opened because everyone was SUPER helpful and friendly, and the place was as clean as can be.

I was unsure about which soup I wanted because they all sound awesome, and they let me sample a couple.  Be sure to ask for a sample if you don't know which one you want!  I ended up getting the red pepper and lobster, and my husband got the lobster bisque.  Mine was better!  haha.  But they were both delicious.  I also got the California Turkey sandwich, and my husband got the BBQ pulled pork--both good.

LOVED the chocolate-covered strawberry that came with my meal.  It's a good deal for $7.99.  Next time I'm going to try a salad.

No weird smells or anything, ambiance is appropriate and it was generally quiet (because there were not many people). Radio music is in the background.

Service: Barely any at all.  I had to go look for people when I had questions or wanted to order something.  This was probably because there were not many people in the place, but I would have liked to have a bar menu or something to munch on while I played.

Order: 4-5 maki rolls, grilled salmon, grilled mackerel, cold tofu, agedashi tofu, hot and sour soup, chicken cutlet

Likes: The hot and sour soup was okay. Price is alright at 13.99

Dislikes:
*Disorganized service. Came to our table 4 times with the wrong order.  
*While not a lot of rice on the rolls themselves, it was mostly filling and not a lot of fish.  Full of cream cheese, veggies and/or tempura bits.  I'm not gonna differentiate the rolls because they all tasted very similar....yuck
* Grilled salmon was charred and burnt on the outside, so
 it's probably not the freshest. 
*Automatic 10% gratuity.  If you are going to do an auto-grat, please do 15% so the servers will care.

The first time from the hotel - it took about 15 minutes for a cab to arrive. The Bellman at the Pittsburgh Renaissance warned me that it might take a few minutes and that I should give them a bit of a forewarning next time - as there are not a lot of cabs just around - unlike some other cities.

The second day from the hotel - there was actually a cab already at curb side - so I did not have to wait.

On the way back to the hotel - I called the cab company directly - it took about 25 minutes before the cab arrived. Luckily I was not in a hurry at this point!

Overall the three cabbies I had were friendly and efficient. Although this one cabby was eating a bag of some sort of snack while he was driving - and was loudly and obnoxiously licking his fingers after each reach into the bag.",2009-06-20 22:16:55

This particular Tuesday night at Miro, the restaurant was mostly empty other than about 6 dinner guests and a few at the bar. I always prefer a plethora of seats to choose from on a less occupied night, than being wedged in somewhere less desirable on a packed night.

Our server was friendly, and made knowledgeable recommendations about the menu. For our appetizers, we ordered Langostinos a Pil Pil, which are plump shrimp tossed in a spicy garlic sauce. There were four in a bowl, which is just right because the entrees would be filling. I certainly wouldn't have minded eating 10 of these babies- it was pretty good. Second appetizer was the baked Parmesan scallops, which our server pointed out was a customer favorite. That dish was also eaten quickly, and enjoyed immensely.

After going back and forth over which entree to choose, the grouper dish and the paella were chosen. Little more needs to be said other than a few bites in, we decided to add this place into our restaurant rotation. I saw about 5 other selections I am excited to try on return trips.

We shared laughs with our server plus others who came over to remove plates and refill glasses.

I've been dropping by from time to time for several years now. I'm honestly surprised they've managed to survive for so long. However, they do seem to have a hand on a niche market - fly fishing.

If I did any fly fishing, I'd be in here for sure to get geared up. Nearly half of the store is dedicated to fly fishing. It's a novel experience to come by and check out all the flies even if you don't actually do any fishing. Nowadays though I don't bother going to that part of the store. They have a good selection of shoes and hiking boots, several knives and utility tools, clothes, jackets, underwear, backpacks and bags. There are some knick-knacks throughout for camping, hiking and the outdoor lifestyle but the selection and variety is very limited.

On a recent stop in here I was looking at bags and the shopkeeper asked if I needed help. I struck up a conversation about what bag I was specifically looking for and mentioned that they didn't have it. He just kinda said ""oh"" and that was about it. Didn't offer to look around for me in case I was missing something. Didn't offer to order it in for me online. It was an incredibly awkward experience. In fact, it sort of compares to many of my recent visits in here because staff has not always been particularly engaging. They seem to just stare at you intently as you walk around the store browsing. Like they think you'll swipe something.

The prices are a bit high on things. But prices are always high on outdoor gear, really. They'd be the same at about any other outdoors store.

It's located in a very large shopping plaza but the plaza is overcrowded with other businesses and every corner is tight.

Waiting at the drive-thru has taken me as long as nearly half an hour for some coffee with only 5-6 cars waiting which makes no sense at all. Since bringing on more food items the coffee seems to be an afterthought which is crazy to me. Coffee should come first & get rid of all the overpriced food.

On Saturday many offered good salmon but the one who nailed it was Switch Restaurant with a seared salmon unlike anyone's with a polenta cake arugula salad and a tiny Parmesan cheese crisp.

The most beautiful eye popping salad came from St Francis Restaurant with greens I never saw before so colorful, so many textures words can not describe.

Heirloom Beets were popular and District American Kitchen had them in a easy to eat  cone salad with strawberries that was very good and North also had them in a salad with house made ricotta and fennel.

Maizie's  Cafe cooked up some real corned beef Reuben's on a marble rye.

Some wineries and breweries were represented and one highlight was Mary Edwards with a very good Russian River Valley Pinot Noir conveniently located near all the Salmon.

The one dessert that wowed me was the gold dusted lemon raspberry macaroon from The Four Seasons.

On Sunday Kobe sliders and Turkey apple sliders from Relish.

The best pork might have came from Barrio Queen and her side of corn in a cup was so tasty anyone would agree.

The Breadfruit made great seasoned Mussels (who knew?)

Large shrimp in chili oil came from the House of Tricks.

Maybe the best prepared fish was the Steal head Trout from Kai it just melted in your mouth.

I wasn't in a head cheese mood so I didn't try the fancy looking plate of head cheese from Petite Maison but I'd guess it was good.

Short Leash dogs had a mini buffet spread of hot dogs.

Tuck Stop had good muffulettas and Tammie Coe had very tasty Crack Cake.

My coworker ordered Pasta, the Ravioli Ricotta e Spinaci which is Ravioli With Spinach And Ricotta Filling, Tomato Sauce.  His Pasta was made before my Panini, but only by a minute or two.  

The Panini seemed a little on the small side, but was enough fill me up.  The house salad was nothing special.  Iceburg lettuce with shredded carrots and some tomatoes.  The didn't ask about dressing, so I am assuming there is only the house dressing which is an Italian. 

My Panini tasted OK, but it was not grilled long enough.  There were light brown grill marks on the bread and the veggies inside were cold to luke warm and the mozzarella wasn't melted at all.  I should have taken it back and had them grill it more, but since my coworker already had his meal I decided not to because he would probably be done with his meal by the time I got my sandwich re-grilled.

I like they way they have plenty space on their dinning place, it's not to crowded with tables and chairs so it's easy to walk arround. 
They have a place in the middle with a small band, I think they have a live music but I don't know when. When I was there, They put a nice soft music, it's not to loud so we still can talk normal without screaming.
All the server had a good attitude..So nice,their smile, polite, kept refill our water. 

Their spiciness level from 1 (not spicy) - 10 ( spicy). I love spicy food so I ordered spicy #8, even thou I can feel the heat but I add their thai chili vinegar + dry chili + chili sauce. I ordered beef pad see(z) ew ($ 10.99)..Flat noodle stir with soy sauce + scramble eggs + chinese broccoli + beef. 
My co workers had chicken drunken noodle ( $ 10.99), beef pad thai ($10.99), chicken yellor curry ( $ 10.99), crispy spring roll (egg roll $ 9.99). We all really enjoy it, yummy
We'll be back soon

""By checking in on Yelp, we get a free order of chips and salsa,"" to the applause of my fellow diners. There may have been a You're-the-coolest-ever dropped after that announcement. Or not. So we order those and the loaded fries. The latter was colossally good. The former, not bad.

Enter Entrees:

It should come as no surprise I ordered the dish with the most bacon--Wild BLT: wild boar bacon, duck bacon, apple wood cured bacon. On 9 grain bread, because it's healthy. Right? And it was truly one of the most tasty BLTs I've had. Other items ordered were the Three Brats (I sampled a bite of each, and all were terrific!), the filet mignon wrapped in duck bacon (I dragged a French fry through the gravy on this one--wicked good), bison, and a chicken pasta dish. [Hey, we can't all be adventurous with our taste buds]. Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their dishes.

I grew up a hick, and I'm proud of that. We were able to eat from the earth and whatever my dad could shoot. At WGG, the gamey-ness, although not very pronounced, reminded me of some great meals we had back in the day. [queue ""Little House on the Prairie"" music]

So Bacon, you may ask, it seems the food here was pretty terrific. Oh ya, I'd reply. But did I tell you about the SERVICE!?!?! [queue dramatic music]

Well, that's the thing. Our idle time between ordering items, receiving them and having engaging interactions with the wait staff was lengthy, to say the least. I'm okay with waiting for food, especially if I'm kept abreast on its preparation/arrival. Or clearing out our dirty dishes. But when we have to wave down our server it can be a bit annoying.

Flavors include ""Marble, Red Velvet, Chocolate Chocolate Chip, White White Chocolate, Pecan Praline, Lemon, Carrot, and Cinnamon Swirl.  There's also a gluten-free offering at only pennies more than the others that I was curious to try though I'm not among the gluten-averse.  

The little $3.99 ""bundtlet"" cakes are a generous serving for one and an adequate serving for two, and no flavor has yet disappointed, including the gluten-free offering.  They were also sampling an really tasty peanut butter cake - that tasted like a very light peanut butter cream.

Also got the battered fish bao, but it was a square shape! Was awkward to eat it cause the bao can't contain it. so much batter I could not find the fish. The bao was not fresh and fluffy, it was kinda hard and dry.

Also tacos are no longer on the Manu.

The décors were all over place with Christmas, spring and summer themes going on at the same time. The service was awful as well. The server was inattentive, rude when we asked for an extra minute to look over the menu and he mixed up our order when the food came out.

The food took exactly 40 minutes to arrive to our table. There were only two occupied tables in the entire café so there should be no excuse for taking that long. I ordered the Caffe Crepe with chicken, apples, avocado and melted brie. The chicken was overcooked and super bland with no seasoning at all. There were no avocados in my crepe. The only thing I could taste was the brie. The crepe was so horrible and tasteless that I could not finish it. Each bite was a complete struggle and I had to fight to keep my food down.

It is definitely one of a kind here in Vegas and it's not like any coffee shop I've experienced before. Gabi is inspired by circa 1907-10 Korea. By the cash wrap, they had a board explaining the inspiration of the newly opened coffee shop. It wasn't the most pleasant story in history as it revolves around the 26th king of the Joseon Dynasty who went into hiding in the Russian legation to work on the future plans of the Korean Empire. It is at this point where he tasted coffee for the first time. He became the first person in Korea in to ever taste coffee. 

Moving on from the history lesson, the ambiance and overall feel of this place enticed every sense. From the historical photographs, vintage pieces and furniture, from the wooden tiered seating area towards the back, and the swing seating by the fireplace; this would be an IGers/snap dream. Every corner and inch of this place was photographically worthy. The staff was very accommodating and delivered your food to you. 

As for the coffee, I had the Gabi and the Tiramisu pod. The Gabi was was good once the foam on top mixed in. I wasn't too much of a fan of the dark chocolate garnish they had on top. I felt that it made the coffee more bitter than it already was. The foam balanced it out but when you got the bits of chocolate in their, it would throw my taste buds off. The tiramisu pod was amazing. So creamy and smooth. It literally melted in my mouth. I'm not the biggest fan of tiramisu so I was pretty surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. It was light and not too sweet. They offer a nice variety of pastries and beverages. For the pastries, the prettier it is and depending on what time of day you visit it may already be sold out for the day. So if you're eyeing something you seen on social media, I highly suggest go earlier in the day to ensure you get to try it. The other nice thing about this place is that they're open till 11pm so if you need to get some work/studying done this could be the place for you. However, when I was there last the wifi was not connecting so hopefully by the time I go back this will be resolved. 

I will definitely be back to try other items. The Gabi was not my favorite but I'm sure I'll find something else on their menu that will suit my liking beverage wise.",2018-04-19 21:15:25

Wings are the first reason anyone would walk through the front doors, and the folks in the kitchen do not disappoint. These wings are meaty, generously sized, and seasoned very well. I can't think of many other places in the city that compare in terms of quality.

Staff are attentive and pleasant, but when it's busier (during sports events, etc.) you might expect visits to your table to be fewer and farther between.

The egg rolls appeared to be your standard, Chinese take-out yellow-wrapper egg roll,but the filing were anything but, came with shitake mushrooms, vermicelli noodles and shredded cabbages and carrots. The fried rice was well done with a large portion of rice and evenly hints of basil. The Papaya Salad and Fried chicken dish was a perfect balance of sweet and salty unripened green papayas with the crisp, bone in, juicy chicken. The sticky rice was enjoyed by all. The Drunken Noodle fell short, arrived with over cooked, soggy noodles, which drowned what was suppose to be a stir fry noodle dish into a stewop; somewhere between a stew and soup. The upside of this dish was it did arrive with a variety of vegetables, more so than your typical Drunken Noodles at other restaurants. The Curry Squash was another let down, ordered with a level 3 heat which was missing, was watery, no curry-like consistency. The squash could have been a little more tender. The chicken that accompanied the dish was bland and tough, almost as if it was blanched then added to the curry after the fact.

Our server was fantastic, even though we stayed 15 minutes past their 10 pm closing time. No one glared at us or rushed dinner service.

I heard through the grapevine that this place is so popular, our armed forces regularly place orders for the legendary cheesesteaks and have them shipped.

It's nestled at the end of Fremont street (aka the ""old Vegas"" apparently), but so worth it to go to! Forget the craziness of the strip, this place is my new favorite! 

My best friend and I were meeting a friend for brunch, and after searching for places, we all agreed to come to The Perch, since other Yelpers posted that they had bottomless mimosas (yay!) ***By the way, it's not just bottomless mimosas... They have bottomless Bellini's and Bloody Mary's too. And you can mix and match them... As in, if you order a mimosa and then want a Bellini instead, that's fine*** 

We arrived around 11am on a Sunday, and it wasn't too crazy busy... yet. Our server, Jessica, was super on point and extremely sweet! She was so helpful, sincere and genuine, it made our experience so much better. We each saw a few things on the menu that caught our attention (other than the bottomless drinks), and we asked Jessica which item she'd recommend and she pointed us in the right direction -- and neither of us were disappointed. 

My best friend and I both ordered the Brioche French Toast -- pure deliciousness! And our friend got the Egg White Omelet. And we had drinks for daaaaayyyssss at our table. Jessica came to check on us and I jokingly asked her to bring over a whole bottle of champagne for us -- and she did -- plus the mixers!!! Such amazing service! Needless to say, we were happy campers (or brunchers, whatever). 

As we were paying, we noticed we still had some champagne left and again, the jokester that I am, asked Jessica if we could have the rest of the champagne to-go... and to my surprise/shock, she said yes! The only thing is that you can't leave the little complex The Perch is in but you can still walk around and enjoy the scenery, and if you have little ones, there's a play area for them. 

Overall this was an amazing experience (thanks, Jessica!!!), and the food was phenomenal!!! Next time I'm back in Vegas, this place is a definite MUST!

The sauce did the trick. Okay, I am digressing...

I can find neat kitchen and storage accessories at reasonable prices. I also subscribe to the store's mailing list. I got a 20% discount off my peeler.

There is plenty of parking here. I got a decent parking spot nearly in front of the main doors on a Saturday afternoon. 

In the checkout line, a woman behind told me that the spiralizer that I was about to purchase works well. I appreciated that endorsement. 

A few minute later, a former student approached her. It was such a heartwarming experience that she was recognized and appreciated after all these years. This teacher inspired me.

They're all great, especially the violins. At times I couldn't tell that there was more than one violin playing. They bring in some of the best musicians in the world, like Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Lang Lang, Joshua Bell, and Anne-Sophie Mutter, to name a few.

They have a program for ""young"" people called tsoundcheck, where you can get tickets for $14. However, it seems too much like last-minute seats so if you know that you want to attend a concert, the regular prices are definitely worth it.

I think the best tickets for the price at RTH are the ones on the balcony sides (section L8 or R8).",2012-08-25 18:08:47

Get the scallops (only $7 on happy hour!). Don't get the octopus though. It comes stewed in a tomato broth and was too chewy for us. I would suggest changing this to just grilled octopus.

Coming from the Bay Area, I have very high standards for Thai food. In the two months since moving here, I have found some places in the Phoenix area that offer good-quality and flavorful Thai food (Wild Thaiger in downtown, Benjarong in Mesa, Malee's in Desert Ridge and Scottsdale), but I have been waiting to find Thai mecca - a place with incredibly savory and well-balanced food that is served with an authentic level of spiciness. That place is Swaddee. In regards to the price, I am always willing to pay a few dollars more for food that is just that much better than its counterparts, and I would definitely pay more for Swaddee's cuisine than for that at Thai Basil down the road in Ahwatukee, which I found inauthentic and almost inedible. 

We started our meal with the papaya salad and tom yum soup. The papaya was crispy and just the right flavor (sweet but not overwhelming), and the dressing was tangy. We asked for it to be '3' level of spiciness (on a scale of '1' to '5') and found that it had a kick without being overwhelming. The soup was unbelievably flavorful with just the right balance between sweet (tamarind) and sour (lime and kaffir). The chicken pieces floating in the broth were really large and tender - no dark meat chunks in this soup!

For our entrees, we had the Pad Thai and Roasted Duck Curry. Many places do their Pad Thai differently with the choice of preparation depending a lot on the region in Thailand that the owners hail from. This particular style of Pad Thai features a thicker sauce which is light on the peanut but heavy on the tamarind and lime flavors (a true ""sweet and sour,"" if you will); it was delicious. We selected '4' as the level of spiciness and found this to add a real kick without obscuring the flavor. As if these first three dishes weren't good enough, the Roasted Duck Curry blew us out of the water. Again, the curry was a thicker consistency than it is at many other Thai places here in Phoenix - almost like a creamy soup. Instead of being that electric red color, it looked like cinnamon. It was absolutely phenomenal - it had a richness of flavor with hints of rarely used spices (like cumin) accented (but not overwhelmed) by the coconut milk. The duck itself was roasted and super-tender and the pineapple was fresh. 

All told, our two appetizers, two entrees, and two sodas came out to $45, probably about $15 more than we spent for the same quantity of food at Thai Elephant or Thai Basil, both places we aren't huge fans of, but it was so worth it. This is true Thai food - not watered down or tamed for the masses - that masters the difficult task of balancing sweet and sour, bold and mild. I will be back many, many times.",2008-06-23 18:40:14

Our server brought out bread at the beginning of our meal--the bread was okay but nothing special; the butter was a nice sweet cream butter.  The crab cake sandwich was also quite small but somehow we were both full (probably too much bread beforehand!).  We also did the feature wine flight which was quite nice.  I'd come back for the wine and probably for the piccolo lunch.

On the service--our server was very distant and not particularly friendly.  She stopped back at all the right times, asked all the right questions, but left us feeling a bit chilled.  Maybe this is desirable at dinner time in the dining area, but for a lunch on the patio, I'd like a bit more engagement with the customers.

On the ambiance--Casbah is quite chic in the dining room, and the patio is more casual.  The patio is a slightly awkward mix of the two, though, as the wrought iron chairs are clunky and hard to move without obnoxious noises, and the hostess stand is located within the restaurant so everyone troops by the patio diners.

It is almost hidden near the City Govt Center under a parking structure (they do validate your parking for up to $1.50, just ask your server for a validation ticket when you leave), but well worth the search.

When you walk in you immediately feel the energy of the place. Its open layout and very comtempo vibe from the bright and warm accent colors and funky artwork to the made-by-the-owner furnishings, it is instantly inviting! We were immediately greeted and sat when we walked in the door and our waitress was at our table taking our drink order in no time flat. The easy to read menus have a eclectic selection of ""made to order"" items that are designed to feed your need for farm fresh, locally grown food or to nurse a hangover with something a bit more savory. Either way you are in for a treat!

I had the Red Juice, which was a fantastically healthy mix of beets, arugula, lime, carrot, red pepper, and pomegranate. It actually tasted delicious! To counteract my health conscious, I ordered some coffee (which is Grade A btw) and the Fat Elvis. This hunka-hunka pile of WTF-is-happening-in-my-mouthness is peanut butter, bananas, Nutella, AND bacon on legit french toast! To offset the insanely delicious gluttony, the dish is accompanied by a healthy heap of strawberries and blackberry garnish. I was definitely a fat, if not completely satisfied, Elvis (impersonator) when I was finally finished!

I had mentioned to our fantastic waitress that this place belonged in Austin as the vibe, decor, and menu just screamed Hyde Park, Rosedale, or SoCo and as luck would have it the very nice owner, Ben was sitting in a booth across from us. He graciously came over to say ""hi"" (he actually interacted with almost every single customer in the place) and we had a fantastic convo. Honestly, a great guy and his awesomeness definitely translates into this great restaurant.

Being close to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area we thought it was time to go check it out. I love nature, especially the amazing rock formations in this part of the country. As someone else wrote in their review here, it feels a little bad not giving this place a 5-star review. I would say the splendor of these mountains deserve a solid 5 stars. I was however disappointed by the name Red Rock Canyon, because there is basically one red rock and a few red layers in the surrounding mountains. Nothing wrong, but after Sedona last week, I was expecting more red. So perhaps I should blame the name and not the park because the views are stunning. Entrance for the car was $7. We briefly stopped at the visitor center. It seems to have a nice outdoor museum, but doesn't allow dogs so we could not go in.

We drove the 13-mile scenic tour with a few stops along the way. The first two outlooks we attempted to stop at had no space. Overflowing with traffic. It eased up further and we found place at all other stops. 

I am glad we visited this place. Stunning views and a nice respite from the Strip.  I would go early in the day though. We got there about an hour after they opened and it was already busy at the first two stops. It only got busier as we left the park.",2016-12-12 04:36:37

Let me start by saying that family combo (small) is ALLOT of meat. They say small is enough for two but for us it served between four people! All the meats was excellent! No bad smell to the meat, meats was marinated well, and everything was so soft. Family combo came with steamed eggs, soup and ice cream for dessert. Soup was not my favorite but the steamed eggs were good. Side dishes was alright as they were not my favorite besides kimchi. I definitely love the pork belly and the spicy beef. 

Corn cheese was so good! The sweetness from the corn mixed in with mozzarella cheese is perfect! Ice cream was soooo good. Too bad they didn't have green tea, vanilla will do.

As long as one is not adding too many bananas, peanut butter, and chocolate it should be a very reasonable meal - but who wants to be reasonable!

We headed up to the pool, which is on the 2nd floor, and ordered a couple of drinks.  The waitress was very friendly and fast with our drinks.  However, the pool wasn't really happening either.....there were maybe 20 or 30 people there at 9 pm.

The owners (husband and wife) are really good people.  You can tell they take passion in their food.  Simply eat their brisket, and you can tell it is significantly better than other BBQ joints.  I actually never really liked brisket because most places make it so dry, but try it here, it is made quite differently.  First time in my life I had juicy brisket, and I didn't need to drown it in sauce to be able to eat it.  Definitely my favorite on the menu.

From the fall of the bone spare ribs, to their bacon mac n cheese, even their fries, everything is made with heart.  I love that.  They have a bunch of sauces to pick from (my favorite is original Bobby Q sauce) their ranch is homemade as well and really good (and I'm not even a fan of ranch!)  They have sweet tea as well, and it is served in jars, nice touch, reminds me of Texas.

But, when our 2013 Mustang's water pump went out while on vacay for Spring Training, we had no choice but to drop it off. And of course it happened on Sunday when the service dept was closed (which normally car dealerships are). They have a night drop off box and very easy to do and convenient. 

So Monday morning rolls around and Scott Arnold, our service advisor finds out what we think the issue is and I let him know we probably won't be able to pick it up until Saturday since we live in Cali. He said no prob we will get it taken care of for you. 

Fast forward to Wednesday and Scott calls and lets us know the Stang is ready! He did tell me it was the water pump (thank god we were covered under warranty) and we can pick it up on Saturday. Easy peasy! So, Saturday we get there and our car is nice and washed and they cleaned the engine as well since coolant was everywhere when we dropped it off. Very nice plus!

This dealership is probably one of the biggest I've seen and the service dept was very organized and friendly. I think they probably tend to do upsell items for your car that you probably don't really need but hey, I expect that at a dealership.

The menu was quite long and even had some Korean dishes.

My food arrived first and didn't look anything special. 
I had to wait a bit till everyone got their food. 
The tempura was dry and the batter was not up to par . This resulted in a much thicker batter than desired and I felt bloated after a few pieces. 
The rainbow roll was just your run of the mill stuff with dried rice and fish. I would say its not much better than any food court iteration.

I never ate in a deli before so this was my first experience.  Boy am I glad I went!  This place is always busy for lunch, so that's a pretty good sign the food is good.

Their menu was big, with lots of sandwiches, po'boy subs, paninins, BIG (I mean like almost foot long big) baked potatoes, soups, wraps, pasta, and even a full service salad bar with all the fixins'.  I had never been there before so I asked what suggestions they had.  The order taker told me to try the 'New York Yankee'.  It is a sandwich made with pastrami and corned beef on rye bread, with Swiss cheese and mustard.  It also came with chips and a pickle.  It was a great first choice, this bad boy was huge!  The sandwich itself was like 6 inches in height.  The pastrami and corned beef were moist and flavorful, and went great with the Swiss and rye.  Not half bad for only $7.99.

Their sweet tea is pretty bomb too, almost as good as Raising Cane's.  Cane's is better mainly because of their pellet-shaped ice.  Their salad bar is nothing to laugh at either.  Lots of fresh choices, and even whole hard-boiled eggs which were great (unlike Sweet Tomatoes where they shred it up).  They even have free Garlic Toast and mini muffins, as well as various crackers that are complimentary to all patrons.  Not just that...but they also have free soft serve ice cream!  Well, free if you buy something to eat.  On second thought, I never asked if ice cream came with everything on the menu.  I kinda just helped myself to the machine everytime I ate there.  Nonetheless, I never got busted for it.  So.....therefore, it must be free!

Not a bad place to have a great lunch with a bunch of your friends.

**Update: All good things must come to an end. So the beginning of the end for Chef Panda happened when I ordered delivery for me and the kids. We have ordered delivery before and been very satisfied-- not this time. I ordered the usual for the kids-- orange chicken and low mein. For myself, I ordered the Mu Shoo Pork and hot and sour soup. When the meal arrived everything looked fine until I started to unpack the food. The low mein was fine but the orange chicken seemed to have been over cooked to the point the pieces were like small stones deep fried in batter with orange flavored sweet & sour sauce. The Moo Shu filling was delicious-- but if memory serves me, Mu Shoo is supposed to have crepes. There were no crepes with the order. The hot and sour soup was overly spicy and overly sour. 

So I thought, hey, everyone can have a bad night so I chalked this experience up to that. **sigh** it appears that is not the case. My wife and I stopped by to order food to-go. We were going out that night and didn't have time to cook. Stopped in and ordered dinner, I had the sweet and sour pork and my wife had one of the beef dishes-- I forget which one. We arrived well before three others and were served last, even after we asked about our order. The food came out and was almost inedible. The sweet and sour pork was, once again over cooked and my wifes dish had too much sauce-- the beef was drowning in the sauce.

Açai bowl is new to Madison (only two places have offerings that I am aware of), and perhaps Bowl of Heaven is attempting to create a distinctly Midwestern version, but it's just not hitting the mark for me.

It starts with the staff. The few times I've visited, they've pointed me to the written menu for guidance. At other places I've visited, the staff have been incredibly eager to explain the menu and even offer suggestions (like put the peanut butter on top instead of blended in, so it could scooped with a celery stick). They even exuded pride in making something especially for me. The staff at Bowl of Heaven have seemed hesitant to offer suggestions. Perhaps they don't want to vary from the menu.

It's all about the end product, and I've noticed a huge gap in the blends between Bowl of Heaven and other places I've visited. First, for a very consistent $8-9 price, açai bowls in other cities out west have way less granola (not a filler I'm fond of) and about 2-3 times the fresh fruit on top. The overall size of the bowls out west are about 2x what is served at Bowl of Heaven.

I really want to like this place, as I'm a big fan of the açai bowl, but it's simply not comparable to the standard I have from my experiences elsewhere. In the meantime, I've experimented with açai bowl at home with my Vitamix, and they're turning out great!",2016-02-04 14:41:45

As a party of 5, we had an opportunity to try a good variety of their signature dishes, along with their omakase ($140.00/pp). If you love omakase, but your dining companions don't, no need to fret. Just come here! Why? Because this is one of the very, very, very rare restaurants that doesn't require that the entire table goes omakase. In fact, only one person in our table, a 13-year old, no less, opted for the omakase. 

Some of their signature dishes we tried were:

Hamachi Tacos - Perfect! I could've eaten all 5 of these mini tacos all by myself. Ok, so I'm getting ideas now for my next visit! Lovely chilled hamachi paired perfectly with the crunchy, fresh tortilla, and just the right amount of avocado and jalapeño peppers. 

Oysters Foie Gras - super fresh, fleshy, with uni and foie gras. Say yes to the oysters!

Sticky Ribs - served bone-in. This was probably my least favorite, but lauded by the waiter as one of their most popular dishes. Overly sauced, for my personal taste. 

Deep fried shrimp served 2 ways - in a wasabi sauce, and  the other was in a light red sauce with a hint of Korean flavoring, but can't recall the official name. It also came with a homemade buttermilk dip. The tempura-like batter held up well, and retained its crunchiness, as this was just lightly coated with their respective sauces. Even as this dish sat a while, uneaten, as we were devouring the other delectables, it's crisp crunchiness held up, amazingly.

Fried Rice with Hamachi - Rice itself was a tad saltier than it needed to be, but the star of this dish was really the fish, which was cooked at the table by searing it against the sides of the searing hot iron pot. Wow! The fish turned out so incredibly moist and flaky. I wish they had this dish with just the fish, sans the rice.

We also ordered a huge sushi combo, which consisted of something like 35 pieces. Slices of fish were exceedingly fresh, fleshy and sliced in generous portion sizes. One disappointment, however, was that we weren't informed that the 35-ish piece count included rolls and tamago (small chunks of scrambled-like eggs). This seemed a little disceiving.

The omakase was very plentiful and artistically presented. Some of the dishes included lobster, tartare, A5 slices (ooh so tender), a seafood bouillabaisse-like dish, and a beautiful 6-piece sushi platter.  Check out my photos. One of the best parts of this pre-set omakase menu, though, was the chocolate bomb dessert it came with. Ooh, a most impressive presentation when they poured a fiery liquid on top of the round chocolate ball, and melted it, causing the chocolate ball to ooze out a liquidy chocolate center. If I could order this dessert separately, I most certainly would!! Plus, it tasted even better than it looked, and it looked pretty darn good! Trust me here!

Speaking of desserts, I'd be up for coming back just for the desserts alone. The doughnuts were perfectly fried, and uniquely presented in a cone, with a round plastic ball filled with pastry cream. You squeeze the plastic cream filled ball to inject the cream into the doughnut. Voila, you've now made your own cream filled doughnut! This was good!

If you're up for going all out for a nice dinner on the Strip, Morimoto's would be high on my list. It's definitely the antithesis of an inexpensive teriyaki bowl dinner at your local quaint Japanese neighborhood spot, but sometimes you just gotta live and enjoy to the fullest.

I was with a friend and we were put in a room that looked a little different from the rest of the rooms. Walking in you'll notice all the dark and relaxing room, the one they put us looked like a storage room and had a bright screen for security cameras.. Really sketchy. Make it worse, that room was right next to where all the employees get the water for the tub and you can hear all of them talking and loud faucet on and off.. Not relaxing at all. The massage was good but the ladies kept talking, despite them whispering.. It was still kind of annoying. My lady had to keep stopping and go to the next room to tell their co workers to be quiet because we can hear them.
You think I wouldn't go back after but I figured as long as I'm not in that one room, things should be good. And glad u did! It was no wait and the chairs are so relaxing, I was in a quiet and dark room. If you never been in an Asian ""foot"" massage.. It's a whole body massage!

I have eaten at Cabo Fish Taco a few times before and I have usually really enjoyed the Baja fish tacos and margaritas.  This time, however, was not the same.  The corn salsa was bland and room temperature. The Baja fish tacos were just not good...that's all I can say.  The typically long, crunchy strips of cabbage were replaced with mealy mush that I guess was supposed to pass for some kind of coleslaw and the usually large buttery avocado chunks on top gave way to a sad little spoonful of browning guac at the bottom.  The fish was super fishy and not in a good way.  I always get the nopalitos salad because I'm obsessed with pickled cactus, but this time I found one slice of cactus amongst an entire bowl of bland black beans and chickpeas.  My boyfriend's Rasta Pasta came without shrimp because they were out (wtf??? no shrimp in a seafood restaurant??) and the sauce/chicken had way too much jerk seasoning that overwhelmed the other flavors like peppers and pineapple.  Our waitress was crazy busy and overlooked our empty drinks more than once, then let us sit for 15 minutes while she attempted to settle our tab.  The margaritas, I will say, were strong and tasty...just like I like 'em.  All in all, I was exceedingly underwhelmed and disappointed that the food has gone so far downhill.

THREE STAR REASONS: 

First, it was a little pricey. 25 dollars and some change for 1 bacon cheeseburger, 1 little bacon cheeseburger, 1 little cheeseburger, 1 regular Cajun fry and 2 regular drinks. 

Second, the fries even though hand cut they weren't hot and actually could have been cooked a little more, they still were a little hard in the middle. If they would have been left in the fryer a few seconds longer they totally would have reminded me of the fries my Mother made at home.

WORTH 4 STARS: 

First, the uber cool beverage dispensers. 

Second, the service was fast and friendly even though they were extremely busy. 

Three, the burger. It was hot, gooey, loaded with all of the fresh toppings I asked for. I loved the taste of the sesame seed bun. I can't find any fault with the burger except the $5.29 price.

Coming here on a Saturday night around 11 pm and I was expected Guu Izakaya would be packed and the restaurant was half full. We have a choice to be seat at the bar, back area, communal tables or at the patio. 

I had been to the other Guu locations and I knew what to expect: loud and cheerful service. So I was not bothered by the loud greeting and lively vibe. My only concern though is the lighting. The interior just too bright with spotlight light set up everywhere. I could barely open my eyes after a few drinks with such bright intense lighting. Please dim the light or I would be wearing sunglasses next time.

Menu is similar to Guu's Church Location. The food is Japanese pub fares with a lot of deep fried items so good to enjoy with a Mega mug of Sapporo. 

We ordered off the Daily Special menu which has more interesting items:

Pan Fried Pig Intestine
BBQ Salted Beef Short Ribs
Tako Sashimi

I got a sesame bagel with regular Philadelphia cream cheese, and I guess the perks of it were that it was clearly freshly made and the coolness of the cream cheese served as a nice contrast.

For those not in the know, Pho is Vietnamese noodles, so this is a noodle house. They have a large menu that includes stir fried and other items, so there is plenty to  choose from.
Pho Dau Bo is a chain, there must be at least a dozen locations now. This one is cash only, so be prepared before walking in. There's plenty to choose from the menu, whether you just want the Pho (soup), steamed or stir fried items. For the less adventurous, there are items like deep fried chicken wings also on the menu.
Try the beef tendon brisket soup (my favourite) or the stir fried beef with vegetables (also my favourite, depending on my mood). There are plenty of versions and variations on the soups and hot pots, so you can find one that suits your tastes and moods.
Staff are pretty friendly, the bathrooms are okay, there's always parking, but most importantly the food is good, cheap and comes pretty quickly.

The first time I went here felt less than perfect which made me search for other places that can compete. A year later, my girlfriend decided to go and now I'm hooked ever since. To this day, I'm craving Taro Milk Tea with boba and egg pudding just like the ones they make from Half &a Half in California. I wanna say, they have a better take on it now. 

Anyway, the taro milk tea is my classic favorite as it's subtle in sweetness but the blend of honey boba really accentuate the flavor. Pair with egg pudding and the kick is even more flavorful. I can't ask for anything better in Boba. 

Every visit here always has a line which feels like a bummer but they move quick. Not only do they do that, but the order is unusually fast too! You can see people using their stamp cards as they show loyalty to the best boba joint in town. I'm hooked. And I'm a boba addict.

Meat is very tasty and RED. Pork belly and pork neck was also good but wished it was sliced a little thinner so it would have cooked crispier.  

I did enjoy that they bring the meat and cook in front of you rather than you going to a buffet line and seeing all of the meat just sitting and waiting to be picked and barbecued.

The side dishes were a variety of fresh items.  Whatever that I had asked for which I would normally get in a buffet line of other korean bbq, they would bring it to me.  The only thing that I wasn't too fond of is their bean paste which is very critical to me. It looked and tasted different.

Additionally, I saw an ad on yelp that Honey Pig lunch buffet is $12.95, which is false advertisement because when I was in there today, the lunch was $14.99 which is apparent that the price has been raised. I did find the price fixing a little annoying but oh well....

Don't be me wrong, there are some deals to found ($0.98 for a can of vegetarian chili beans!) but I've still gotten the best hauls at Smith's. Regardless, the lure of affordability has brought in the masses. This place is always crowded and the lines are always long. 

CONS: Produce isn't the best quality here. Limited alcohol selection that tends to be on the pricier side anyways. Personal care products are more expensive than Target. I find the bread selection to be sub-par. Unfriendly/unhappy employees. Navigating aisles after midnight is extremely difficult since that's when the stocking crew comes in. You have to bag your own groceries. Weekly advertisements are unavailable. Will not price match.     
PROS: Open 24/7. A few items are priced shockingly low. Ex: A huge bag of salad is $1. Bag credits of $0.10.  

Obviously, I think the cons outweigh the pros. It's a rare occasion when I come to Winco to do some shopping.

This is one of the hidden Hilton Vacation gems in Las Vegas, it is located centrally on the strip. 

Parking:
The hotel shares its parking with Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino and with Miracle Mile Shopping. The lobby from the hotel is not very far compared to Hilton Vacation at Flamingo. Check my review on Yelp.

Pool:
Pool is located on the same floor as the lobby. You can't missed it when entering the property. It is a good size pool but the hotel does not have the real estate to have a grander pool such as Mandalay Bay (has lazy river and wave pool), Flamingo, Caesars, Mirage, and others. But it was sufficient.
 
Check In/Out:
Check in early is allowed if the room is ready. You will need to check in at the front desk to know if there is a room for you. Check in time is at 4pm with check out 10am. One bad thing about Hilton Vacation Homes is that the check-out is set with no ability for late checkouts even if you are a HV member of the Hilton Honors.

Room:
I stayed in room 3219, which was a one bedroom suite. The room was decorated with modern furnishing and it was very nice. The desk in the room however need more electrical outlets. People tend to charge and work from the desk. Having only two electrical outlets (used by desk lamp and clock) leaves nothing for the guest to use.  Other than that, everything was good.

It was late summer and our excitement had been building all morning anticipating another delicious meal at Faley but, when we arrived, there was a sign on the door indicating it was closed until the end of August! Talk about build me up, buttercup.  As my colleagues' tears started to set in, I knew I had to quickly come up with a Plan B. Then I remembered that there was another Hakka restaurant in the same plaza. We were all in agreement that we would try it but didn't expect too much.

It was about the same size as Faley, the décor was simple and it was very clean. We all ordered off the lunch special menu - mango chicken, crispy beef and dry chili fish. Similar to Faley, the food arrived very quickly, it was hot and fresh and the portions were quite generous. It's difficult to compare it to Faley as it's a different interpretation on Hakka cuisine so it would depend on your taste palate. Faley's dishes are a bit more bold and saucy, whereas here, I could more taste the Asian influence. We all really enjoyed the food as it was prepared with good quality ingredients, not greasy and no MSG. Prices were competitive as well; the specials were all under $7.00 and came with rice, springroll (delicious) or soup. We even ordered food to take home from the regular menu.

Service was not as entertaining as Faley; however, our server was very sweet and accommodating and, when we were leaving, the owner genuinely thanked us for our business.

My only complaint is regarding the Manchurian Shrimp Hakka Noodle. It was very flavorful, had great texture, good portion size BUT it only had about a dozen small shrimp. At first I thought they gave me vegetarian in error.

The long and short is if you're a foodie that wants to branch out to various Hakka restaurants or if you're craving Hakka and it's a Tuesday when Faley is closed, Hakka Cottage is an excellent alternative.

Our waiter was really what made Thai Hana stand out apart from all other lunch sites in Oakland.  He was friendly, even though he was busy, and really made us feel welcome and special.  He joked around with us, suggested items, and was very prompt with our order.  He recommended the Thai Iced Tea, one of my favorites, which I didn't even know they had. 

Next time you're in Oakland treat yourself to lunch or dinner at Thai Hanna!",2013-12-13 02:31:46

Now, let it be known - I am a big fan of Pink Taco. But, as the locations have slowly closed around the western US, this location is my least favorite.  Not sure why they don't carry the best thing: BRISKET TACOS -- the other locations had it, and the Century City location still carries it.  OMG - it's the best!

I've been 5-6 times to this location at the Hard Rock.  The food is just okay, nothing great.  They do have great chips & salsa, delicious margaritas, but food - eh.  This is a great hangout, though.  Always good to pop into before/after a concert or a night out with friends.

Rumor has it, their website states, that a sunset strip location in Hollywood is coming soon!  Bring it, and bring it soon with the Brisket tacos!  Other locations may be San Diego and Miami.",2011-10-06 01:50:16

I've been looking for a place where I don't need to make an appointment with someone that's good because they are ALL fantastic. This place is out of the way for me, but it's exactly what I'm looking for. Just a few minor details: wish they had better exhaust fans/ventilation. The fumes can be intense sometimes; poor cellular reception (in case you are needing to work on blackberry); and always make sure you ask them for what you want/expect since you're paying for the service anyway. Some ppl have complained that the service wasn't this or that and were very displeased because of it. I've had the same experience (I came a little before closing one time so I understood the frustration) where the lady was going to completely skip my cuticle care, which is a big part of a manicure, because she was rushing. I just asked before she started putting a base coat and she did it and did it very well; leave a good tip! Not only do they deserve it, but they remember you and they go an extra mile because they know you Appreciate it through tips.

I said no and was shocked to find out they've been in business for about 10 years. Those door hangers really do the trick for advertising. The pizza was absolutely delicious, really tasted home made rather than ""pizza franchise"" like some others. I think possibly some of the reviews about long waits and cold pizza are due to their much larger than normal delivery radius.

Do not waste your money on the personal trainers. Go to Harris. 

Also, the bathrooms are designed to incubate an Ebola outbreak: no access to soap without having to press the nasty dispenser multiple times, the soap is not actually useful as it is weak foam which comes out in tiny amounts, the water is also dispensed in small amounts, you have to keep pushing the handle with your (dirty?) hand then try to quickly catch the water so that you might be able to rinse off the fake soap foam, but to even rinse your hands you have to do it in the worlds shallowest sink which means your hands never always completely clear the surface of the bathroom sink. And finally, if you do manage to wash your hands, you might want to bring your own paper towels because - as with the soap and the water - the paper tower towels are meagerly dispensed. The paper towels come from a super slow machine which slowly portions out paper in 4 inch by 8 inch strips. If you have enough time to wait for them, you'll need at least three paper towel slivers to dry your ""clean"" hands. 

The best thing about the Morrison Y is the exercise class schedule. Lots of variety. Donna Clem rocks. The booty barre classes taught by Donna, Rose, and Elise are fun and achieve results.  (If you take the BB classes taught by Gina be sure you remove your shoes or else she will talk about you the entire class period)

Surprising, right, what with being in the context of a chiropractor review?  I suppose it's my fault, really.  Bad chairs, getting older, lifting heavy things, the fact that I perch like a gargoyle in my chair (Hey, you live life your way, and I'll live mine, okay?)....

I decided at the beginning of the year that I was going to start taking better care of myself, and not be so slouchy all the time, so after some solid Yelp Talk recommendations, I booked an appointment.

Here I am six months later.

Teddy is just a neat guy.  Friendly, funny, very health conscious and supportive for getting me back on track for better posture and feeling better.  That guy can crack my derpy back like nobody's business, which is impressive, considering I can be incredibly inflexible at times.  And yet, he'll pop something out of my spine or neck that makes me nearly melt to the floor.  I look forward to him kicking the crap out of my back, because I feel so much better after a session.

Vincent is great as well: Super easygoing, and flexible on scheduling.  I never have to second guess anything.  What I request and we work out is exactly what I get.  Vincent really makes the office a welcome and inviting environment.

My back does feel remarkably better.  I sit up straighter.  I have less aches.  The lessened discomfort has helped with my stress levels and overall attitude.  I still sit like a gargoyle at times, but we all have our personal hurdles to overcome.

Teddy's commitment to health is appreciated.  He genuinely cares about the well-being of people and making them feel better.  I can actually help out the house better thanks to him (much to my chagrin, yet to the delight of the missus).

When I asked what was up in Yelp Talk a few months back, ChiropracTED came up repeatedly, and I can see why.  Friendly, kind service with increasing results in my health every time I've gone in.  Not feeling like I'm hunched over like a neanderthal and being able to sit up properly means a lot to me.

It is really beautiful inside. They have done a great job with fixing up the place. Sometimes it feels like they spent too much money on the décor and not enough on the beer and food (this is a typical Charlotte problem that I have noticed)

Some of the food feels gimmicky- like the shrimp with cotton candy wrapped around it. The flatbread is meh. The most painful thing is the beer though. It just isn't good. I love a brewpub. Charlotte NEEDS a good brewpub. I don't think this is it. I know I sound like a harsh beer snob, but I really expected better beer. 

The brunch- it is a buffet brunch. I'm just going to say it- I'm not sure if Charlotte needs another buffet brunch. It was pricey. It really wasn't that good (buffets aren't really my thing though)

 Always has a lot of holiday items, which isn't my thing but just an FYI.
 The only complaint I have is that the red tag fabrics and the remnants are hard to figure you out on the pricing. I actually have to ask them to ring things up in case I want them by price.  They should have some scanner on the wall to make it easier for everyone.

They have your basic coffee and similar bevs and some breakfast items, and they have other more lunch-able stuff like sandwiches for the mid-day.  And then they have a wine bar that also serves beer and food and they sometimes have musical entertainment at night.

There are three things that are most noteworthy, though:

1. Personality
2. Atmosphere
3. Personality

A big comfy couch by the fireplace on the wine bar side, another room on the coffee side with some comfortable chairs, a ""dining room"" area with more normal chairs and tables, some outdoor seating, some basic tables and chairs on the wine bar side... you can pretty much sit anywhere you want or need to and enjoy a piece of your day.

My family and I stopped by on a Sunday night and of course, we expected a line. However, the line moved quickly and we placed our order with Catrina. She was very sweet and answered our questions about the drinks. She also explained how you can adjust the sweetness of your drink. I chose regular sweetness and I think it was just right!

I was looking around Uptown for a quick meal since I was still feeling the effects of jetlag and ended up at Tin Tin Box.  I've noticed that many of the Asian/Japanese spots around Uptown offer ""hibachi"" type meals.  You rarely see that term in CA so I was definitely curious.  Found Tin Tin Box on Yelp and decided to try the Hibachi Combination.

The Combination comes with chicken, beef, and shrimp cooked on a hot flat top with mushrooms and their sauce, which is most likely some sort of seasoned soy sauce.  You get to choose from rice, fried rice, and even brown rice, which is nice for the people looking to eat more healthy.  I went for the fried rice and then went upstairs to their dining floor.

The chicken and beef looked precooked when the cook brought it out , and the only thing that really needed to be cooked was the shrimp.  I was really disappointed with the shrimp, since it had such a fishy taste to it, probably from being thawed out.  The chicken was probably the best, since it did soak up the sauce fairly well.  The beef was just diced up cubes of pieces.  It's all made better by their dipping sauce though.  Some sort of mayo-based sauce, it's sweet, almost like a milder version of thousand island!  However, I could only eat so much of the sauce before I felt it was too greasy. 

Now... it is fast foodish so I didn't expect them to make the fried rice on the spot or anything, but I was really disappointed when the fried rice was just lukewarm.

For a quick lunch, this place might be okay since this place would have your food out really fast.  Panda Express might be a better. Probably should've gone to the other Japanese spots around the corner from my hotel to check out ""Hibachi"" though!",2011-11-11 17:11:09

Didn't know it was affiliated with Gallo Blanco until I noticed a few familiar dishes on the menu. That's a good thing, since Gallo was one of the few, more authentic Mexican restaurants I enjoyed.

Food is excellent. You won't find the giant canoe sized plates full of shitty rice, pasty beans, questionable meats, soggy tortillas and watery salsa here like nearly every other TexMex toilet in this town. Everything I've had has been really good; tacos are outstanding, the Naco Torta is extremely good, and they've managed to keep most of the oranges out of the guacamole here (biggest let down of Gallo, ick!). We will try breakfast eventually. Only gripe was an entree steak salad I ordered. For the price, I expected something a little more generous than what was put in front of me. The steak was awesome, but they could have fluffed it up with another handful of greens. That being said, I won't venture too far from their staples in the future...

Drinks are good, a lot of innovative combinations that actually work, but all are super pricey and their quality is highly dependent on who's behind the bar. They have a few good beers, but nothing out of this world. 

Where they lose stars, is the service. We have had outstanding service here, but we've also had Denny's like dismissive, inattentive service. Dry drinks, M.I.A. wait staff or bartender and a dash of attitude are what to expect when you strike out on service here. When the right combo of staff is working (seems to be just a few individuals that drag down the entire front of house), then your experience will be drastically better.

I was invited to start ridding myself of stress by doing a paraffin dip on my hands. That was heavenly and I felt my cares melting away slowly. I then was taken on a tour of the entire facility. The place is HUGE and very nice! I went back into the common area and was invited to have a chair massage... ahhhh this evening is getting better and better! After my massage, I had my gnarly brows waxed. It's amazing what a little hair removal can do for your face. I highly recommend getting your brows done here to guys and girls! The aesthetician that did my brows was not only good, but she was educational about my skin and brows. After all that, I sat down to get my makeup touched up. This is where I wasn't as pleased. Bless the guy's heart, the artist had NO clue on what colors to use on my skin. He was SO excited to do my makeup, so I let him just go to town! I looked like a really dark Barbie with really BRIGHT lipstick... can you say radioactive tangerine lips? If you want something done right... do it yourself. Ahh well, my makeup is a mystery to many artists. It wasn't his fault. He tried.

All of the taquitos on the menu sounded amazing, but I think I made a good choice.

We finished with the jalapeño bread pudding. If you were born without a sweet tooth, like me--get this! I love a little bit of savory in my desserts. And I can't forget to mention the cucumber margarita. At first, i wasn't sure if I liked it (oddly enough, while I'm not a big fan of sweet food, I generally go the opposite with drinks. but who can resist cucumber...not me!). It kind of tasted like spicy pickle juice...but after I acclimated myself with those first few odd sips, I decided I was in love. It was unusual for sure, but refreshing. I can imagine this as a perfect brunch drink.

In all honesty, I would come back to Cleveland just to eat at Momocho again. Who's down for a roadtrip?",2011-09-16 06:46:45
kWzOA-HWXiUWuJ2Dax7d_Q,JPGhZJt7qWkjD1CoCnSftQ,02BXFKzu1rgaYulNGYvi6g,4,2,0,0,"2nd visit to Matsuda for lunch AYCE. Tenichi would have been a good AYCE choice but unfortunately they don't do it for weekday lunch. Matsuda is closer to me so I came back instead.

Was really impressed with the food today and feel bad for not giving them more credits and providing more details.

I really like most of what I ordered today and am very impressed with the quality and care they seem to put into every single item.

What I ordered and really like:
===================================

salmon sushi - though fish is thinly sliced, it's fresh, not half thawed, presented nicely with 'tail' draping over rice, rice is also cooked well, not too hard or mushy

miso soup - light, not too salty, something about it just taste better than other places

mango roll - mango sauce is nice, sweet and refreshing

sunshine roll - love the spicy mayo, not too overpowering

sirloin steak - cooked fresh to order, straight from the grill and arrive hot at your table, cubes of tender, juicy, garlicky goodness, love the small slices of garlic tossed in

beef teriyaki skewer - like the sirloin steak, very tender and juciy, but marinade is sweet

onion rings - tempura style, lightly fried to perfection, onion is thick cut enough so you really get the texture and taste of the onion under the light batter

tempura calamari and tempura zucchini - also lightly battered and fried with care, calamari is tender and not over cooked

Matsuda golden shrimp - very lightly battered and fried to perfection, very plump, juicy, fresh shrimp taste

fried capelins/smelts - nicely fried and not greasy

grilled cuttlefish balls / takoyaki - very good

mango yogurt - light and refreshing, definitely everyone's must have

mango mousse - good flavor, smooth, like eating a good mango mousse cake

durian mousse - like whipped cream with good amount of durian flavor, very nice if you like durian

I'm certain there are lots more well made items on the menu, but that's all my stomach have room for today :)


Then there are a few things that I felt were meh...not so great, nothing special, could have done better:
=================================

tiramisu - like bland whipped cream

rainbow roll - average, nothing special like the mango roll or the sunshine roll and doesn't deserve to be a ""chef's recommendation""


Overall, the food is really good here. Better than what I remembered the first time to be.

However, though service is quick and they rarely mess up on orders at lunch, the tone of the servers aren't so friendly, especially when the place starts getting busy. If only they care about their persona like they do with the food. Guess they figure there's no need to be nice to you since the bill already include tips.

Washroom is very clean.

This place is 5 min from my home and as long as they keep up the quality, it will be my regular AYCE.",2014-02-21 23:33:53

Pretzel bites tastes like dust they were so stale and the cheese was from a can for sure. Check the same item at the HUB to see how it's done.  

This place is upscale, gorgeous and should have top notch everything.

For the most part, most of the ladies are very nice and are meticulous in their work. Today, I wasn't so lucky. I usually only get a pedicure but decided to have both a manicure and pedicure. 

The nail tech doing my pedicure was nice and was careful in her work. It wasn't the same for the tech doing my manicure. 

When I sat down, she started small talk and wanted to know if I wanted my eye brows done. I said no and she said that she does brows. I said no thank you again. My manicure and pedicure were being done at the same time but I could only focus on my hands. She wasn't gentle (I have a cut on my cuticle and she kept sanding my nail beds to the point it irritated the cuticle and skin around my nail bed) and her work was sloppy. 

She asked me to pay before I got nails polished, so I handed her my credit card and $20 for her to break. I'm usually very accommodating when nail places ask for tips in cash. She brought back a $10 and two $5's - I asked for one of the $5 to be broken down again.

She must have not liked that - perhaps she was expecting the $5 tip since that's what she gave me. I gave her a little more than 20% - I probably shouldn't have. When she polished my nails, it was sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I chose a darker color so even the smallest smudge is easily seen. I thought she might go back and clean it up, but she didn't. It's disappointing because I've had good service here before, a few times.

I would go back to Aloha Nails because it's so convenient - maybe just for a pedicure - but I'd avoid this nail tech in the future.",2013-09-22 20:55:49

The steamed fish was good. The service was very good. But the real draw here are the huge crabs and lobsters. Our crab came prepared two different ways - the crab legs were fried and the crab claws were steamed. The lobster was prepared with ginger and green onion. In both cases, the meat was soooooo tender and succulent! And perfect flavour.

I went to see Paul the next day after skimming a bunch of 5* reviews. 

I have thick, shoulder length, layered hair that is very malleable and naturally wavy if I let it air dry but I usually blow dry it straight b/c of time constraints. I told Paul I am trying to grow it out so I can get the full effect when I wear it wavy. I thought I would need a moisture treatment b/c of all the sun drying I've been doing but he said it wasn't necessary, that after the cut all it would need was some leave-in conditioner for the ends.

He gave me just the trim I wanted. Whoever said he is meticulous is absolutely right. I enjoyed watching him work and I'm more confidant knowing that my hairstylist is concentrating on my hair and not the conversation.

He styled my hair using the blow dryer in a way that reflected its true shape, voluminous with a light curl. I had no idea it was possible to do that with a round brush. I watched in awe, no stylist has ever tried to do anything other than blowdry or flat iron my hair which leaves my hair looking limp and unnatural. 

Paul listened and I walked out of there happy. All the stylists there looked like they love what they do and the clients seem loyal. The atmosphere is hip but casual and the decor is sparse but eye catching. Give this place a go.",2009-09-14 02:40:02

I really liked their service. The waiters were all very attentive to my table. We would finish only about half of our cups of drinks, and they would quickly come by and refill them without us having to ask. So there was actually never a time where our cups were completely empty. They got rid of of our used plates very quick also. Which made me glad because we woud have enough room for more plates of food :]

I went at lunch with my brother and mom on a Monday. So lunch cost about $16. So with everything they offered, i really do think that their price was reasonably good.

They had a big variety of sushi considering they are a buffet. Beause all asian buffets that i have been to that did serve sushi only had a small variety. So i really liked that about this place. 
Their sushi also tasted very good in my opinion (and i've eaten a ton of sushi in my lifetime)
I absolutely loved that they had shrimp tempura, because i could eat all of it as much as i wanted! Their tempura sauce tasted good too.
I didn't taste their udon noodles, but i did taste their udon soup, which tasted really good also.

I didn't get much of the other food that wasn't sushi, but the ones that i did eat were pretty good. Nothing too special, but ok none the less.

They had a wide variety of dessert also. Suprisingly, i was able to get a taste of each and every one lol I'm not a big fan of fruity desserts, so i didn't really think their desserts were all that poppin. However, if you do like fruity desserts, then i think you will love them. Their chocolate fondue was ok. I've had chocolate fondue from other places before and after the chocolate covers the fruit that you chose to dip it in, the chocolate should harden a little/dry up in less than a minute...however this place's chocolate fondue didn't do that, so i think they used the wrong type of chocolate or something...?
So my favorite dessert was the cheesecake. (omg i LOVE me some cheesecake! :O)

This place is relatively new and is located on the 2nd floor right on Bloor. 
My memory fails me what used to be here as I have passed by this area a few times.
Anyway on to the spot we stuck to the bar area as someone said that's the place to be to see a master craftsman at work.
The liquor list is awe inspiring and some very rare gems are available here. Some even more interesting options are the set of flights they offer here. An excellent way to try a sample before going for the main attraction.
My partners in crime ordered a Oak Aged Cocktail flight, Mumbai Special, some beers (they do have Maudite on draft but were sadly all out) while moi went for the Yamazaki 12 year old Whiskey. 
The flight is interesting as these cocktails are aged in small wooden barrels (proudly on display) and the person who ordered it thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Even more spectacular was the Mumbai special as the guy pulled out liquid nitrogen to make this stuff. The preparation drew ohh and ahh from everyone around and the person who ordered it enjoyed it immensely.
I am new to Japanese Single Malts and try them whenever I see them. This one is a very good iteration of Japanese Whiskey and I would recommend it. 
The bartender is old school and is very well trained. Its a treat to to watch him at work as this is an ode to old school bar-tending (sadly a dying art form IMO) . There is modern take on making cocktails on display here but the mannerism belong in the glory days of yore (from what I have seen/read in movies/novels) 
The decor is kinda rustic and is designed to last for eons. Nice copper finish on the ceiling and the bar.
High recommendations here folks as this is one of the best traditional service bars I have been to in TO. Now only if they had a heated patio for me to enjoy my cigar with some libations I would never leave :)

They smelled and looked pretty good so today I decided to screw the salad and tag along.

Vic met our crew with a smile and joke while we talked through the options for hot dogs. When I go to places like this I usually follow the pack and order what ever the Chef recommends. Growing up in Chicago I have had my share of hot dogs so I was interested on his take of the subject now that I am down here in the south.

The crew decided I needed 4 hot dogs a couple ""Life Changers"" and ""Heroin"".
I only got 2, one of each. (I should of got 4)The combination of flavors on the hot dogs were well thought out. The jalapenos actually had a flavor crunch to them. (Most places just throw toppings on). It was obvious to me that a far amount of pre-prep was done before he appears.

I love the JJ's location in Dilworth (and have given them 5 stars) but this location is struggling and had this been my first JJ's visit it would have also been my last. 

We arrived at 6 pm on a Sunday evening, knowing they close at 7. We thought an hour would be plenty of time to have a hotdog. We walked in and it appeared they were already closed for the night (because the drink station was broken down and there was no one working the counter), but they said they were open.

They were out of tea, various toppings, straws, and bottled water (but they don't offer tap water which is ABSURD in Charlotte). This location also does not have the speciality dogs that they have at the other locations and does not have the pickle bar which the other locations have. 

There is very limited seating - just bar top seating and then 3 tables that each sat 3. So you cannot dine in with a group.

I paid for a drink before learning they were out of tea, so when I then asked for a refund they were visibly annoyed. They also brought me the wrong food and again appeared annoyed when I informed them it was incorrect. 

I feel this location really weakens the JJ's name - from the lack of specialty dogs, to the lack of the pickle bar, to the poor service, to the lack of tap water, to the incorrect order. I live the Dilworth location, but I will never come to this location again.

My second round I approached the wok station.  I filled my plate with the raw ingredients then passed them to the chef.  Al though I chose the sauce my plate seemed a bit tasteless.  My noodles were way over cooked, my veggies under cooked and my meat was rubbery.  I barely made it through half the plate and left the rest for garbage.  My third visit to the buffet brought me to the sushi.  Oh how I was excited for sushi.  I grabbed multiple pieces of various different kinds of sushi.  My first choices was the chicken maki roll.  Well ive had my fair share of sushi and the chicken that they used was chicken salad as you would put in a sandwich.  It was horrible.  The rest of the sushi was super hard as it seemed like it had been sitting out for quite a while.  Another epic fail.

First, although the street address is 900 S Las Vegas Blvd, the entrance is actually on Hoover Ave, closer to 4th Street.  The Las Vegas Blvd address is for the Soho Lofts building.  There's no visible sign from the street so look for suite 130-140 (one of those) above a door, which is the entrance to a lobby -- I imagine to the Soho Lofts.  Just head straight inside and you can't miss the bar.  Parking is available across the street on 4th and Hoover, but it's (sort of) unpaved/gravel-y so watch out with strappy heels!  

The inside is dim but has some really neat antique/gothic looking furniture, e.g., high back velvet chairs and tables with marble tops.  The walls are lined with bookshelves from floor to ceiling with books.  There's also some beautiful ornate chandeliers and light fixtures.  

The sitting area is pretty spacious with lots of chairs, chaise lounge chairs and sofas, and looks like it can accommodate various groups of people.  They had music playing from speakers, but it wasn't so loud that I had to shout to talk to the person next to me.  It also looks like they have a DJ booth.

Carbonara had nice pieces of bacon (not the maple leaf stuff)  and plenty of cheese.

The peking duck pizza was nicely cooked with ample cheese.  I'm not a fan of hoisin sauce so if you don't like overly sweet sauces, opt for tomato sauce instead.  I got a small one, which is about 4 slices and a good appetizer.

We finished off with the panacotta.  That was the best part of dessert.  

Salads look very large and would get that next time.  Highly recommend!

SERVICE
Service was good. Very attentive and friendly staff. The owner also walks around to see everything is good as well. 

FOOD
Food is not bad. There were a lot of options for rice less rolls on the dinner menu and they all tasted good except for one. It was tuna something. Majority of the fried stuff we got or grilled rather was pretty burnt. 

PRICE
I think $28 is pretty pricey. On the weekends, they only have the one price $28. On weekdays, lunch is like $20 and dinner is $28. I guess I wouldn't mind paying for the price at night if I was really craving sushi and I didn't want to drive so far.

Next issue up is the quality of drinks, if I order a vodka soda and you are going to charge me $8 for well i should probably be able to at least taste a hint of vodka. Considering I had a better made vodka soda with better vodka and more of it across the street at El Hefe for 25% less and didn't have to pay a cover thats not good.

They had $5 mules as a special, I opted for a martini but my girlfriend got one and said they were really good. We decided to just order appetizers and share them. We shared kung pao shrimp,  pretzel sticks, fried pickles and brussel sprouts. The pretzels were stock frozen pretzels that were tasty only in the fact that pretzels are inherently tasty. The beer cheese and  whole grain mustard they came with were both good though! The kung poa shrimp was just fried shrimp with sweet thai chili sauce and peanuts on it. All in all tasty but nothing special. I honestly would have loved the pickles...they weren't overly breaded and they were thin and crispy. However, they were super super salty. I was pretty sad because they also came with a dill dip that was also really good. If they just didn't salt them after the fry, I think they'd be stand out for sure. The sprouts were probably my favorite! They were cooked really well and had a nice zesty lemon dip!  Plus I'm always happy to eat sprouts at a restaurant that aren't covered in balsamic and truffle (though i love those too).

Most of the time I dread buying a car, but I had a really great buying experience here.  I showed up on an oddly rainy and cold Sunday afternoon and Chris Hanson wandered around in the rain with me explaining the different options for Jeep Wranglers.  He was a good guy for hanging out in the rain.  On my return trip to test drive Jeeps I was referred to Gaylon Walker as Chris was out and about.  He was also an A+ guy to work with.  They had no issue with me test driving about 6 different Jeeps ( they come in a lot of options ).  There was no pressure to buy they even let me take it home to see if it would fit in my garage on a test drive.  When I decided on the Jeep I wanted the negotiation process was fairly painless. I really dislike it in general, but it wasn't too painful.  The only slight annoyance was it took a long time to get all the financing in order ( the finance guy was really nice as well ).  I think they were just backed up since it was late on a Friday evening when I finally made up my mind.

The staff is actually really nice there.  I'll update after I get my first oil change and service so we'll see how that goes.  All in all I had a great experience here and would buy from them again.

- Ask for Gaylon Walker or Chris Hansen",2013-02-11 20:30:07

Except for major exhibitions, members' previews are relatively quieter. Previews allow you to appreciate the exhibitions before they open to the public AND you get to meet people who care and love arts ... not just tourists. 

Oh I love tourists, just not in museums. 

The collection is decent and adopts a ""thematic"" concept instead of periodical. For example, there is a section of women in power from different periods. I personally do not like the ""thematic"" concept as it makes it difficult for me to ""study"" arts. What it allows me to do though is to appreciate the piece devoid of any context when and why it was made. 

But it's not sexy. There's also something sexy, oooh sexy, about entering a room with paintings from the same period. 

Overall, your visit will be satisfactory. 

Keep your camera because you won't be allowed to take pictures inside. I do not know the logic behind it considering that THE Moma and SFMOMA allow you to take pictures inside.

There is typically some community toys lying around so that you can play fetch or just let your dog wander.  Don't worry about your pup overheating from all the running and playing,  there is a doggie dog fountain to keep them hydrated.  
One of the best aspects of this park is the community.  Dog lovers gather and socialize while our pups play. Almost Everyone is quick to clean up after their dogs mess but when they don't there is a community scooper. I've actually seen many people just walk around the park to clean up what they find.  For those of you who don't routinely keep poopie bags the local patrons and Boy Scout troops periodically supply extra plastic grocery bags for the community to use.",2014-03-08 00:36:41

Kaya had been on my brain for months, and I was on a mission of sorts to try them out, but all I knew was that they were on Smallman Street. 

I strolled down Smallman, a road that for the first quarter or so is pure industrial loneliness, particularly after dark. I passed Kelly O's: Closed as was Smallman Street Deli.

""They're a power metal band from Finland.""

""Oh. Ummm, is that your scene?""

""I guess.""

""Oh, I'm sorry.""

""No, it's cool. I'm just not used to it being put that way.""

""Metallica changed everything you know?""

""Yes, they did, didn't...they?""

Just as the conversation was getting...awkward (There was a tension between her and I for some reason, initially only. Hipster vs. metalhead?), I requested a side dish of fried plantains. Alas, there was no such thing on the menu that evening, but with a desire to please, Autumn rushed back to the kitchen and brought me two plantain chips. 

""These are on the house,"" she assured. And crispy and sweet they were. Immediately, our dissimilar musical tastes became irrelevant and all that mattered was our shared love of food. 

""It's cool that you like plantains,"" she gushed. ""I don't know why we don't sell them. Maybe next time.""

That's when she recommended the Conch Chowder to accompany my sandwich, and a fine luncheon foil it was. Not having ever had conch before, I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was akin to a clam that was more ""to the teeth"" if you dig. The milky broth never coated my tongue enough to miss the conch's oceanic flavors, nor did it allow the subtle nibble of the poblano peppers to go undetected. Sweet potatoes and corn merely disappeared and resurfaced in the pale liquid, frolicking like children in a swimming pool, adding texture and sugar to the warm, solacing, tropical stew, rounding it out if you will. 

Guilefully dimidiated on a bias, plated in a manner that creates the illusion of height, and served with a bowl of shocking orange chipotle aioli and some sour pickle chips, Kaya's Cuban Sandwich is street food morphed into haute cuisine through presentation alone. Tastewise, it is genius immaterial of where or how it is served and eaten. The turkey, pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and mustard are stacked in a deliberate sequence between with the flaky cuts of elongated baguettesque bread. I applied the pickles at Autumn's request and dredged each half of the sandwich through the ochreous, spicy cream before every bite, experiencing grains, sugar, salty proteins, dill, sharp cheese, and piquancy as actualized in the most exotic yet humble grinder you're likely to find in Pittsburgh. 

Once again looking to my mod, new, platonic acquaintance for guidance, I chose as my dessert (Kaya doesn't list them online for some reason) the Pistachio Pumpkin Pie. Served with a tantalizingly tart quenelle of cream cheese ice cream, a caramel glaze, and shards of pistachio brittle, it was apparent that ""pie"" was a misnomer. No, upon seeing and tasting this mildly decadent pastry, it seemed more like a dense, raisin-studded muffin in composition. By itself, this pumpkin cake would humbly satisfy a mid-morning hunger with coffee, but when paired with such creative companions in the aforementioned candy and frozen dairy product, it became a stroke of the sublime. With that, my affair in the Lesser Antilles had ended. Kaya, you haunt me...

P.S. Autumn was efficient, accommodating, adorable, groovy, and didn't charge me a dime for the chowder.",2012-12-17 05:03:56

Played about a month ago and the course was in pretty good shape greens weren't awesome, but they rolled a pretty decent fast speed for the end of the summer when greens usually struggle. The pace of play was pretty good, they were running a local special for $43, for a shotgun start at 7:30 am. We beat the heat at a great price for a really fun golf course. 

Be prepared for a difficult challenge. There is very little room for error off the tee so bring your accurate sticks :)
Great views of the strip from 11 tee, and 18 tee, and even #1 fairway and #2 tee and fairway. Great set of par 3's on this course and the par 5's are pretty lengthy. The course finishes with two par 5's so hopefully you can grab a birdie on one of these two holes to finish your round.
 
4 good stars, would be 5 stars but when they aren't running local end of summer specials, they are way over-priced, especially for locals.

The sashimi dinner had 4 different types of fish, a spicy tuna roll, and a miso soup and a salad to start.  The roll we had was a Rock N Roll (tuna, salmon, white fish wrapped in cucumber, avocado & crab stick w/special sauce).  All of the fish was pretty average... not bad, but not great either.

Madison Soles is centrally located on State St. They carry a good selection of quality shoes, including casual shoes such as flip flops and sandals, sports and hiking shoes, dress shoes, boots etc. It's a particularly good one-stop solution if you are looking for different shoe categories at one go. I like how I get to browse sport sandals and winter boots all under the same roof. The brands are also good quality, so it doesn't come as too much of a surprise to be prepared to fork out a good price for them. My favorite buy was a pair of V-Italia tall boots so warm and cozy for winter. 

Service wise it kinda depends on who are working there at the time of you visit. I have experienced really friendly and prompt service from greeting you the moment you walk into the store and being there when you needed something, to salesperson sitting at the counter and coming over when you call for them. Either way they are helpful and patient. They would give suggestions and help you out until you find the perfect shoe with the perfect size and fit. So unless you are super sensitive it shouldn't be an issue. 

If you are budget conscious, visit their sales rack. Or even better, there is a yearly Maxwell Street Festival in the third weekend of July where you can pick up some great finds at discounted bargains.

Point is Sprouts needs to staff the registers....all of them every day (like Whole Foods, like Target, like anywhere that is quick). Today is Thursday and it was 11:30. Saturday was the same thing. A few weeks ago, same thing. So it has not mattered what day it is.

I go out of my way for Sprouts because it's reasonably priced and great service on the floor....but the anxiety and line-cutting and frowns that ensue when we all wait to pay, I just can't come back for a while. I will have to shop at Whole Foods, which is closer and also happens to make sandwiches. In fact, I will make my own sandwiches dammit. I'm capable! 

In conclusion, I will spend the extra $ at Whole Foods for less overwhelm at the register line. Oh well.",2015-06-04 19:28:27

If your not familiar with Dim Sum I read that it translates to leisurely Chinese Brunch. Servers stroll the large dining room and some of the servers stop at your table and say, ""Want Something?"" 

Some of the food we tried was DELICIOUS like the appetizer super crispy fried chicken and the tender crisp Chinese Broccoli possibly called Yu Choy.

 Some of the food I found was for an acquired taste like the mushroom and bean stuffed tofu skins and the sticky rice.

 Some food looks familiar but is different than expected like the sesame balls that I had at many places stuffed with sweet bean paste but here they were stuffed with fruit.

There is a slight language barrier with some of the help because for some English is a second language.  I asked the cashier when they serve the menu so I could order off a menu next next time and try the fresh fish. The cashier just recited the restaurant hours to me.

The very large dining room looks like a banquet hall and looks like it holds over 300 people. They sat us on what looks like a stage. I was able to leap up to the table but it would be too difficult for some people.

ydgwfKsWoOcIBXcvKpKeDQ,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,3,9,8,9,"There are two distinct kinds of friends who have given me their accounts of Haji Baba, a long-time Middle Eastern culinary institution in Tempe: Arizona natives/ASU alums, and Middle Easterners.

Arizona natives/ASU alums: Why do you go to all these other Middle Eastern places? Haji Baba is the best! The best, I tell you. Are you even listening to me? It's awesome! And cheap! I'd go there after Econ 102 every Tuesday and Thursday. No need to go to any of these other places, see? Haji Baba is the best. Now, go!

Middle Easterners: My friend, why do you want to go here? How is it, you ask me? Meh. It is just ok food. They give you a lot of food, but nothing tasting very special, you know? If you go here, just do your shopping and eat somewhere else.

And with those distinct camps of opinion, it's no wonder that it took 21 months for me to set foot in here. But I finally did so a few nights ago...

Haji Baba is another store/restaurant hybrid, which seems to be the M.O. of most Middle Eastern establishments here in the Valley. The store, to the left-hand side, had a pretty good-sized selection of Middle Eastern goods, except you can obviously tell that this place is right by a college campus, with the near-entirety of one long shelving unit dedicated to every flavor of hookah tobacco known to man. I didn't spot a durian, rhubarb, or garlic-flavored tobacco during my initial scan, but I'm sure they were in there somewhere.

The separate dining area is to the right, except for two small tables on the store-side of the wall. Which is where the waiter decided to seat me, even though there were open tables of equal size in the dining area. I thought this was a little odd. Was I being sequestered for some reason? I didn't think I looked disheveled, but what do I know. 

Anyway, I ordered some baba ganoush with pita for appetizer and then the chicken shawarma combination plate for entree. I'll agree about the prices. They did seem very reasonable (the combination plate was $6-something). Also, they had choices of either Arabic-style or Persian-style kabobs, which I pretty much never see in the same restaurant. 

As I waited for my food, I was given a tall, frosted plastic cup full of ice water. The problem was, though, that the cup was so tall that my accompanying straw completely disappeared as soon as I dropped it in. Oh well.

My baba ganush arrived and it looked really great. However, the taste was so mild that you could barely distinguish it from hummus. You'd have no inkling whatsoever that this was eggplant mush. It had none of the smoky, slightly bitter flavor that baba ganush is known for. Which is fine. Maybe milder, meeker, less potentially offensive flavors are the way to go in a college setting, but I was a little disappointed.

Then came my chicken shawarma entree, which had a sizeable pile of the aforementioned chicken plus hummus, tabbouleh, rice, and more pita. I could see how as a college student that this would be a great value. Even as a working professional, this was still good value. In front of me was a lot of food for not much money. They were generous with the amount of chicken they gave, a rare sight in many of these restaurants. But again, hoping for amazing things, I was underwhelmed by the taste of each of the elements. Not that any of the items tasted bad, but that their flavors were more muted than other Middle Eastern establishments I've been to in the Valley, which I can say now is more than a small handful. 

That said, Haji Baba did succeed in one thing - too *much* food. I was so full that I left with a lot of my rice and pita left over, which pretty much never happens. 

So in the end, what do I make of this crowded, local ASU favorite? 

5 words: It is ok, my friend.

The customer service was great, especially considering that we arrived less than an hour before closing. The cashier encouraged us to take our time and dine in.

I ordered the Bang Bang burger sans tomato and lettuce...well done. When my burger arrived quickly I wanted to believe it was due to great service. So, here's where it gets tricky. I fully understand that a burger cooked to an internal temp of 160 is considered well done, even if it's still pink. Ugh, I know that, but I am not a fan of it. I get it. It's angus beef and you don't want to overcook it. Yet, there's something about the ""a little too pink"" patty that gets me every time.

Asian Legend seems to be one of the less reviewed Chinese restaurants located in Chinatown. Which is surprising because they serve all different types of Chinese food starting from your foodcourt style, hand made dumplings to Shanghainese chicken. This restaurant seems to be fairly new and is managed by younger generations of Chinese assuming from the interior and the restaurant layout. There are 2 floors and the restaurant is very clean

Both times I visited, I sat upstairs and the lighting seems to be an odd issue. Seats closer to the store front has excellent lighting cause of the huge window upfront, but as you walk more into the restaurant, it gets super dark because the ceiling 'lamps' they have are very dim.

They have a paper menu system so you basically write down the number from the menu depending on what you want. This system is convenient because the restaurant is so busy they can't spare time to wait for you as you flip through the pages plus you can take your time browsing the menu.

First thing I noticed even before I got my food is that they actually have very good service. They actually smile at you and are fast and efficient at same time. YAY for friendly asian restaurants found in Chinatown! 

Ordered: DRUNKEN CHICKEN SOAKED IN LIQUOR 2/5
*#33 on the menu and a plate for $6.95
*Usually when I order drunken chicken, they are actual chicken pieces with some bone inside
*This one was in round pieces without any bone
*This is a cold chicken dish and you can def smell and taste the liquor
*Drunken chicken usually has this bright yellow skin outside due to the liquor but there was no skin
*I had this with hot sauce, which isn't a good thing in this case because good drunken chicken should be seasoned enough on it's own
*This was almost a little too mushy
*I prefer it done the right way, just regular chicken pieces on bone with the skin (the meat is chewier)

Ordered: SAUTEED SNOWPEA SHOOTS WITH GARLIC 3/5
*#102A on the menu and a large plate for $11.95
*This is a very big dish even for a vegetable
*Overall it had good garlic flavor but it was over cooked and too soft
Ordered: Steamed Shumai with Shrimp & Pork 3/5
*#7 on the menu and 6 pieces for $5.95
*This is the Shanghainese style (not the usual ShuMai you get at DimSum)
*There were lots of seafood inside the ShuMai
*Shredded shrimp and crab meat on top
*Good to share between 3 people
*It was kind of mushy inside and there was no texture
*Tasted good overall but would be better if I could tell whatever was inside

Ordered: STEAMED SOUP DUMPLINGS WITH GROUND PORK 3.5/5
*#3 on the menu for $5.95
*I've had many soup dumplings at different locations but this one had the most soup inside
*It has very thin skin so be careful when you pick it up
*It comes really really hot right out of the steamer
*Vinegar dip could be stronger

Ordered: HOUSE SPECIAL STIR-FRIED NOODLES W/ BBQ PORK & SHRIMP 5/5
*#131 on the menu for $9.95
*Hand made noodles with sweet soy sauce 
*Very big portion (can be shared between 2)
*Noodle is thick but super chewy
*Lots of ingredients (pork, squid, shrimp, mushroom, carrot, bean sprouts, green onion, cabbage)
*This was really filling but so delicious
*I would get this dish again for sure!!

Summary: Overall I enjoyed all the dishes I ordered at the restaurant, especially the House Special Fried Noodles. The noodles were so chewy and it comes with seafood, meat and veggies.

Mimi's was introduced to me when I lived in Reno, NV during my college years. I tended to like the restaurant, although a bit pricey for a college student, I still indulged every once and awhile. Even though it was chain - it was quaint. But this Mimi's.... yikes, not even close to what I remember Mimi's to be.

First off the place is so ridiculously loud it reminds me of being in my middle school cafeteria. Not even high school - MIDDLE SCHOOL. Loud, obnoxious, you have to yell across the table at your fellow diners. I could barely hear what my boyfriend was saying half the time we were eating. 

Next - food! Honestly I'd like to give the food 1 star, especially their selections. $1.99 to add on soup or salad? SHEESH. Come on Mimi's... is your soup and salad made from gold? I don't think so. I had the $10.99 lunch time special, basically I thought it was the only thing on the menu that was worth the price. It came with your choice of an entree and a soup or salad. I picked the French Onion Soup and the Brie Burger. I should have known better than ordering the Brie Burger. Brie is a delicious cheese, but done poorly it is tasteless and this was definitely tasteless. This burger was a catastrophe. TINY piece of brie, seriously, you can't even give me a big hunk of brie? You have to have a bunch of it to get the taste! Also, the burger was supposed to have dijon on it, which I thought would be an amazing addition. NOPE. They gave me half a shmear of Dijon. I could barely taste it! This burger should be ashamed of itself.

And about the soup.... how dare you screw up French Onion soup Mimi's. This is the one place where Americans might extend their culinary desires and order some delicious ""French"" food. But no. You can't even do that right. A sad little crouton, barely any onions, and although the cheese was melted nicely on top there was NONE IN THE SOUP! Who does that? ARGH! 

Lastly, the Mimi's in Reno (at least when I was there) were not stingy with the complimentary bread. Our waitress brought us THREE pieces of bread. There are two of us. WHY would you bring two people THREE pieces of bread? You can't even bring two of each? Two of the rolls and two of the brown bread? COME ON!!

Mimi's management must be cracking down on their servers here and the economy must be cracking down on Mimi's. From the experiences I used to have, compared to what it is now is just sad, sad, sad.",2011-12-22 00:10:48

Since going back to vegetarianism a few months ago, Veggie House has been there for me and I'm always excited to treat myself here! You are seated very quickly, orders are accurate, servers are polite, food is delicious, and I've never once left feeling dissatisfied. What does that tell ya?!

So far, I've ordered all of the stereotypical 'Chinese' dishes and have yet to be disappointed. I can't wait to come back, branch out, and order something I won't see at a Panda Express. Lol. My favorites have been the house fried rice (Asian food necessity), pan fried fish (crispy and flavorful) and the orange chicken (of course, of course). If you order beef or shrimp, you'll find that the texture is closer to tofu but it's delicious nonetheless. Oh! Unless it's the crispy beef... That stuff is so spot on that I'm afraid it's real!

My favorite thing on the menu are the steamed buns. These buns I would definitely rate 5 stars. My favorite is the soft shell crab.

I had the pork ramen which I didn't like at all. I don't get how this is the best selling item on their menu, and how a lot of yelpers are raving about it.

Brendan and his staff are always coming up with new sandwich and soup creations every week to go along with their regular menu offerings, which are fantastic as well.  My go-to is their turkey club sandwich with a cup of their tomato bisque.  Portions are hearty and the flavors are on point! Everything is made from scratch, including their fresh baked bread, which really makes the sandwich!  It's nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. They use as many local ingredients as possible and operate on a no-waste policy where they only prep enough food based on what they think they'll sell for the day.  In other words, once something is sold out, you're out of luck until the next day! 

Inside is pretty rustic with wood floors throughout and a few small tables to sit down at.  It's fast casual, where you order and pay at the counter and they'll call your name when it's ready. It gets really busy during the lunch rush, so unless you come early, you'll most likely be taking your order to go.
They don't have a parking lot, so it's street parking only.

Then, inquired to make a slight change to my pizza by replacing the prosciutto with salami or pepperoni and they wanted to charge me $3 extra. As well, i wanted to have tomato sauce instead of white sauce and they charge extra for that as well. Basically, you know where this is going, any slight replacement wIll cost  you.. I wasn't too impressed since their pizzas aren't exactly cheap and they feel like they have the right to charge  a supplementary fee for any change....

In terms of the pizza, I felt like they cheaped out on the toppings and the presentation- see pics. The vegetables didn't look too alive and appetizing.

SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE

From beginning to end, (hostess, waiter, busser) the employees were top notch. They were obviously experienced in fine dining and knew how to be friendly enough, but reserved and polite at the same time. 

The restaurant itself is HUGE. Since we came pretty late, there were not many tables filled, which would have made for a very relaxing dinner if it wasn't for the inappropriately-chosen pop music and table of rowdy drunk women nearby.

FOOD

Do get:
The rib-eye (super juicy and tender)
Jumbo asparagus
Strawberry-raspberry mini macarons (the accompanying yogurt gelato is refreshing)
Jumbo lump crab and roasted beet salad

A fresh menu of daily soups (today was carrot & sweet potato. SOOOO good! My daughter nearly licked the bowl), sandwiches, and salads. My go-to order is the prosciutto salad with an eggplant sandwich with prosciutto. The salad is AMAZING. Fresh mozzarella, pesto, greens, tomatoes, and a creamy vinaigrette that automatically comes on the side without asking. And then the toasted sandwich on their beautiful freshly baked bread with pretty much the same ingredients of the salad + eggplant. I've also tried the curry chicken which is very flavorful, but IMO, doesn't top the eggplant sandwich. 

Lastly, do not forget dessert. Yes, you can get a chocolate twist as a dessert, but my kids call that an appetizer. For dessert, do NOT skip the chocolate tart! This isn't typically what I'd order but my friend asked if I wanted to share and I would NEVER turn down trying new menu items. So, we ate this, and forks were scraped across the plate until there was no more chocolate mousse left over and every tart crumb was gone.

Ok, now that the dramatics are over, this place was AHH-MAAAYYY-ZIIIINNNG! I mean, $26 bucks?!? All the delicious meat, seafood, and veggies I can manage to shove down my gullet hole?!? Angry Korean moms as servers, yelling at you every time you mess something up?!? It doesn't get a whole lot better than that.

I had never been to a place like this before, but I quickly became comfortable after the group of people I was with assured me I would love it. It's actually pretty exciting. You are sitting at this large table, with something in the middle of it that you can light on fire. That, in and of itself, is pretty damn cool. I love interactive eating experiences. 

My favorite OF COURSE was the Kalbi/Galbi beef (short-ribs). My table figured out that if you heat up the grill and can get it to the perfect  temperature (not too hot, but not too cool either), then you will get the most tender, perfectly cooked meat that practically melts in your mouth. It's an art I guess lol.

Since it was all you can eat, we ordered a little bit of everything that tickled our fancy. There was baby octopus, pork belly, beef tongue, spicy chicken and pork, you name it. And almost all of it was good. The only one I was not really feelin' was the octopus, mainly because, as my new friend Anthony M. stated, the octopus was just plain. No seasoning or marinade, no lemon or anything to really put on it... So it just ended up tasting a little basic.

The sides were really tasty as well, like our steamed egg, soup, and perfectly cooked rice that even came in it's own little metal container to keep it warm. 

Honestly, our table pretty much devoured everything as soon as it was brought out!! Misti Y. and I tapped out early, but the guys kept ordering more and more meat. There was no end in sight!! I seriously think they ordered like, 10 lbs of meat. No joke. We certainly got our money's worth.

I would more then recommend anyone who has not tried this place yet to stop in and give it a go. It's a really fun experience, and the food is great too. Just be careful where you sit at the table.

When I came into the salon I was welcomed by Charles at the front desk where he offered me a drink, and told me that my hair dresser will be with me shortly. I had Michelle. She is amazing! I told her I wanted ombrè but to make them look very natural so she suggested sombrè. Then I was contemplating on cutting my hair or not and she said she'll do a long layer trim and see if I wanted to go shorter from there. 

I give Michelle and other hair dressers so much respect in dealing with long haired guests like me because it could get challenging. It took a while to put color and foil in my hair, and to wash my hair. However, Michelle was focused, smiley, and she always checked up on me to let me know that she could get drinks/ pick up food next door for me if I got hungry. After my hair wash it took a very long time for her to brush out my tangled hair, and I give her so many props for this because she was very consistent and determined to ensure EVERY SINGLE strand was not tangled. She explained to me that the owner, Todd taught her and her employee's to always perfect a client's hair. It reassured me that she wasn't going to do a half-assed job, everything was down to the T. I could tell she put time into my hair because when she was washing out my hair after removing the foils, she kept on re-washing it, which didn't leave my hair in a stiff-like texture, LOVE! And when she finished at 7pm (their closing time) she still asked if I wanted my hair curled and did so instead of rushing me out. 

Overall, it took about 6 1/2 hours to do my hair. It was a long process but it's because it was done the most best and right way possible. My service cost $365. Due to the fact that my hair is long and the quality of the service they provide, it's very pricey.

I never thought in a million years I would order meatloaf at a restaurant, but after all of the positive reviews and a glowing recommendation by our server, I had to dive in.

Let me just say it, this meatloaf is more like a ground up steak than your standard high-school cafeteria fair.  Moist, complex and paired with awesome onion straws and mashed potatoes.  The rest of B's menu is just as complex (though occasionally forgettable) and it plays a great Americana twist on some common staples.

Starbucks in the 100% smoke free, non casino lobby, and a wonderful, remodeled, non douchebag pool area with tons of loungers and cabanas. 

Room sizes vary - we have tried the 1 bedroom and loved it, this time we had a king but I think it was a little larger than just a standard king, it was perfect (large couch area, mini fridge, microwave). The shower heads are heaven. The rooms are updated and clean.

A short walk through the Miracle Mile mall and you are in Planet Hollywood or on the strip. 

**Note regarding housekeeping - HGVC ""owners"" only get housekeeping something like once a week (I know this because I made the mistake ONCE of sitting through their sales pitch - avoid that like the plague!). If you are a non-owner (a regular hotel guest), you have to alert the maids that you want your room cleaned using this cool system they have by the room door.

Sopapilla with Cinnamon, Powdered Sugar, Honey

Doing a poor job of investigating Phoenix's diverse Mexican dining scene during a short residence, the variety of fare and region-specific styles truly impressive in retrospect, it was to Maria's Fry Bread and Mexican Food that the GPS was directed on Friday afternoon, the family-owned restaurant on East Thomas proving to be as good as rumors suggested.

Open for just under one year, the lack of a website or answered-phones making the storefront with a Drive-Thru the sort of place best visited without a lot of research, it was half-passed one that a party of three entered the former Burger Joint, an expectedly ethnic décor speckled by oddities such as octopus vases on the counter or Barbie and Ken on a swing hanging from the wall.

Dining with Spanish-speakers, though the staff was English-fluent, it was after brief perusal of a short menu that an order was placed, one large Horchata in a Styrofoam cup presented with complimentary Chips and three housemade Salsas ranging from mild Tomatillo to what the server described as ""inedible hot.""

Waiting mere moments for plates from the kitchen, a few other diners previously present enjoying their Food, it was with all three plates presented at once that the small table was flooded, first bites of a crispy Tostada with refried Beans and Green Chili impressive in the range of its flavor and downright irresistible to a friend who reminisced of where she had previously experienced the smooth yet spicy taste.

Moving on to two Fry Breads, the word Sopapilla used to describe a plain disc served with Honey, Cinnamon and Confectioner's Sugar meant to be dressed to taste, the second selection was served folded with the puffy Shell light and virtually oilless around tender house-braised Beef plus bright vegetal flavors , Beans and Cheese.",2017-01-07 19:42:19

You will find just about anything you may need for your pet under one roof here. Thing is, on certain items you can find them at much more affordable prices elsewhere.

-Plastic chew toys can be picked up at the 99 Cents Store instead of the $7-$20 range I saw here.(Really?! $20 for a f*cking plastic chew toy??)
- I just learned today(the hard way) that even pee pads for our puppy can be found at the 99 Cents Store. We did grab some here for $5 a pack because the 2nd pack was 50% off. Not bad, just not as good at the 99 Cents Store.
-dog and cat food is slightly cheaper at WalMart but I will gladly pay a little extra here if it will keep me out of WalMart!

As long as you catch a promo or coupon here, it isn't that bad. The store is always clean and the employees nice. No complaints there.

I can still remember my first visit well (cue the blurry, squiggly lines and flashback music). My wife and I stepped into the store and were surprised to discover it filled with all sorts of strange knick-knacks, plates, wind chimes, furniture. It was like some sort of Ikea meets a middle eastern bazaar. Ialmost walked straight out in bewilderment, but my wife somehow managed to drag me in and we made it toward the back of the store and discovered the edible goodies from around the world and, most importantly, from Australia.

I was absolutely thrilled to discover that Cost Plus carries Australian ""Bundaberg Ginger Beer"" -- a product  and brand ubiquitous in Australia -- complete in its brown glass ""stubby"" bottles. The label is a little different than what I was used to, featuring a kangaroo, presumably as the most recognisable global signifier screaming ""Australia"" to Americans, instead of some guy kegging-up brewed drinks, but the taste is the same. Today, my wife (an American convert to the ways of Bundaberg) and I can't drive down Blue Diamond without a stop in to Cost Plus for fresh supplies of Bundaberg. You'll also find Cadbury's chocolate (the real stuff, not the abominable version made by Hershey's that you'll find in supermarket chains), biscuits (that's Commonwealth-speak for ""cookies"") from around the globe, an assortment of imported wines, international delights such as Vegemite and Marmite, curry sauces, salsas, crackers, and more.

What prevents such a treasure trove of great memories from home and new international experiences scoring the perfect five stars? Well, firstly, ninety percent of the store is the aforementioned non-edible odds and ends from around the world. Fine, they are international goods - but stuff like this is imported all the time and I've seen it all before. A plate or some knives and forms, or a chair is the same wherever it's from. The other problem is that Cost Plus, in addition to carrying some wonderful stuff that you just can't find elsewhere, tends to pad its shelves with items that are already generally available in the US at grossly inflated prices. I'm sorry guys, but Patak's Curry Sauces aren't exotic and tough to find anymore. My local supermarket sells them. Darrel Lea Licorice (from my home city of Perth, Australia) at $4.00 a bag is too much to pay when target and Glaziers have it at a fraction of that price. Ok, so perhaps somewhere in the wilds of Wisconsin some of these things aren't generally available, but the store could easily adapt to suit each marketplace, surely? I can accept that while the homegoods dominance of this store is one of their main drives -- something I will have to live with and accept as ""just not my bag"", but when it comes to the food, I would love to see the available-elsewhere-for-much-less chaff cut out so some more excitingly tough to find goodies can fill the resulting free space.",2011-12-14 00:53:55

They got a few specials every day which has limited quantity.  To see the specials you actually walk into the kitchen to talk directly to the chef.  Every time I got the special I was extremely satisfied. The cost of the specials is around $20.  
The items from the menu are all really good: Calamari (both grilled and fried), octopus, dips, greek salad (With huge pieces of feta cheese), Saganaki cheese (grilled cheese with a shot and lemon poured over it). 
The only thing I was not a huge fan of was fried Zucchini.

We were there for almost three friggin' hours and were never made to feel pressured to order more or clear out. The server was helpful, as well as able to find that sweet spot between ignoring you and being annoyingly present.

The food worth the price in both quantity and quality. Unlimited tea/coffee refills were plenty welcome. Music wasn't too loud to talk or too annoying to ignore. Daylight filled the spacious main floor.

Really, the only nit to pick would be the unfortunate spacing between the two urinals in their men's washroom. If two guys had to go at the same time, the guy on the left would have to put his right foot under or on the left foot of the guy on the right? So yeah, a little more space might be wise but whatever, it didn't come up. Otherwise, it was very clean and pleasant in there.

The menu's a little cluttered, but having too much choice of too many exciting variations on traditional breakfast fare is a first world problem if there ever was one.

This little restaurant with large glass windows intrigued my imagination for a few months now.  It's elegant simplicity of decor as well as dishes is quite the find!
It's not anything extravagant, yet you get a fantastic dining experience for a small price - just what you look for in a typical neighbourhood restaurant. 
The food is mildly spicy, not hot at all, and the staff seems to take pride in what comes under their hands. 
We had a wonderful three course meal that included the soup of the day, a Tacos dish, and dessert (Flan).
It didn't look like a big meal, but I actually left very satisfied!
The soup was very interesting - every bite had different bits and pieces that wonderfully complemented the tomato and chicken broth based soup - avocado, coriander, tortilla bits - every bite uncovered new tastes and textures. 
Each of the tacos dishes included four tacos and small bowls of rice and beans. Our initial response was that it looks like very little rice and beans - but we realised that these go in the tacos, and you really don't need much. A squeeze of lime on top and wow! Tasty! I really liked the pickled onion that was on top of my steak tacos.
The flan was OK. I probably would not order it if it wasn't already included in the table d'hôte (but I finished mine all the same!).
Service was reasonably quick and very attentive. We got all the answers to our questions about the menu with a smile. 
The vegetarian selection is highly limited, and my partner feels like she has exhausted it, but I would be happy to return and sample some more dishes.

Located inside NY NY this is a typical dueling piano bar just x3 dollars :)  Two bars to stumble to for drinks.  Seems like there's always more dudes there but there's always hot chicks for the single guys.

My girlfriend had never been to Vegas and I decided to take her here for her first night out and we had so much fun.  Great songs always to sing along with and especially towards the end of the night - everybody sings with so it's not like a lame Karaoke bar.

Always a great mix of people in here from everywhere and everybody always seems friendly also.  The Crown Royal flows like waterfalls, which keeps me happy :)

Tips make the songs play and the piano guys always seem to get some sort of theme going on, especially towards the end of the night and will usually put two groups present against each other.  Like that night there were a bunch of guys from Ireland and some chicks from Canada... the piano guys basically said whatever side's song gets the most points (dollars) will play as the final song of the night... Irish won ;)

Cover I think was $15 for standing side and $25 for sitting side... I'd say stand and have more fun.  Sitting side always looks more boring anyways.

They're open till 0300, which for some reason is a good time to start walking to a great breakfast place. I think we made it to a place in the flamingo or something.

I'll note from the outset that I have ordered the same thing every time I've been here, so the scope of my review is slightly limited.

I have worked near this place for over 2 1/2 years but always thought it looked a little dodgy and never went in. Decided to give this place a shot the other day. Turns out, it is quite nice inside although it has a slightly 80s feel to it.  I've only gotten take-out at this location, but it was pretty fast both times.  I ordered the grilled chicken pita with a side of green beans.  Both were delicious--so much so, that I went back the next day and ordered the same thing.  The pita is a little soggy (at least, it is when you get it to-go), but the chicken is nicely grilled and the tzatziki sauce is also tasty.  And while green beans sound super-boring, they must jazz it up with some spices because they were quite delicious.  

If I ever venture off this recipe for success, I'll update accordingly.",2011-01-22 18:31:43

This is a really cute little coffee shop in Bay Village, perfect for meeting up with friends, reading, or getting some work done. The menu is a lot to take in when you first walk in, and is honestly a bit overwhelming because of how it's displayed, but I told the girl it was my first time and she pointed out where the coffee roasts were and explained the different ones. I opted for the medium roast and it was pretty good. But, what I was really impressed with was all of the baked goods! Lots of giant cookies, muffins, granolas, etc., and they had different ones for different dietary needs like gluten free, vegan, etc. I had the Mojo Monkey Muffin (vegan with banana and chocolate chips), and it was very good! As someone who hasn't been vegan for very long, I'm so happy about the fantastic options they have, and I'll definitely stop by on a regular basis when wanting to pick up some goodies. When my husband came with me he had a bagel with cream cheese and a Buckeye frap. He wasn't super impressed with either, but he's a little bit picky, lol. 

I will say though, that this place is a little bit loud. The music is a bit loud (although not any more than Starbucks, for example) and it's always busy with lots of young people meeting up, people having business conversations, moms getting together with other moms and their kids, etc. So, if you have a hard time concentrating when there's a lot of background noise, like myself, do not forget your headphones! But overall I really like Mojo's and would definitely recommend it over a chain coffee shop. It's just a really cute local place and I would definitely suggest checking it out if you're in the Bay area!",2016-09-13 16:16:12

Menu was reasonable but bar had the most options with unusual whiskeys, oversized rocks, and signature drinks without too much sugar. Ceviche enjoyable with well brined scallops, shrimp, and chili threads.

Guess the one nagging detail was how the bar treated a young man, under dressed but paying cash...geez they requested drink payment right away then they almost double charged him for the drink when he paid up for the later  entree.

The front area has great people watching of Trade St., there is a back patio for more privacy, and there is a side patio with lawn games.

We were not disappointed in Boiler Room. The service was great, the environment was fun, industrial without being heavy and definitely a nice place to dine at night. There was not a large crowd, but I don't think we went until later and night. The music was at a perfect volume, and I liked that the restaurant was a little more edgy compared to its predecessor. 

After flipping through the menu, my husband settled for the appetizer portion of the Duck Lettuce Wraps, and the waitress (the moment I said I was gluten free)suggested the lobster pasta but made with zucchini pasta. You know...a mandolined zucchini instead of pasta. Low carb and delicious? Sign me up!

My husband's lettuce wraps left him wanting more. Savory, not greasy, delicious and just what he wanted them to be. My pasta was great. Maybe a little more salt and pepper and a hit of cheese would have helped just a bit, but it's not like I'm complaining here. I ate most of the dish while my husband finished the rest.

You told me you had ""Real Fruit Smoothies"" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called ""Real Fruit Smoothies"". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. 

As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the ""I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks"" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this ""Real Fruit Smoothie"", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. 

After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. 

McDonald's....come on. You don't make a ""Real Fruit Smoothie"" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT!

It's a very chill kind of place, kind of set up like a cafeteria with long tables and benches, so what you are supposed to do is place your order at the counter and then pay, after which servers will bring your food to your seat. They have a very interesting menu, with lots of exotic meats: kangaroo, guinea fowl, pheasant, wild boar, rabbit, bison, elk, duck with foie gras, etc. It's a carnivore's dream come true! I ended up getting a kangaroo sausage which has fine herbs in it and topped off my order with sweet peppers and sauteed onions. TBH some of the other sausages (i.e. duck with foie gras, maple and blueberry infused bison) sounded more appealing to me, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try kangaroo meat. ... I thought it was okay, it definitely tasted different from like beef or pork or chicken so it was kind of an interesting experience, but it wasn't like a standout sausage for me. It was also $9, and quite honestly I would have been just as happy with my $3 street meat - but that's just me.

This would also be a beer lover's paradise, because they have sooo many unique beer options on tap. I had a Paulaner for $8, which is a German lager. You know it's legit when your German friend gives it his seal of approval, as they are quite particular about their beers over there.

My friends and I also split a small order of the duck fat fries and the dirty duck fries, which comes topped with jalapenos, peppers, onions and WVRST special sauce, which kind of tastes like curry. The sauce on the dirty duck fries was too spicy for me, so I didn't eat too much of it. I quite liked the duck fat fries though - the duck fat really does make them more fragrant, and they are salted quite a lot but I still enjoyed them.

This is a pretty cool place to chill with your friends after work or something, because the environment is just so casual and laid back. I will say that the setup can be a bit confusing for a first timer though. The guy working at the front was not that helpful at first - he told two of my friends who arrived first that he couldn't seat us until our whole group was present, then made two of us who arrived later wait out in the corridor even though our friends were inside. Then he tried to direct us to a table who had just gotten up to go and place their orders, which resulted in us standing around awkwardly and all confused. Other than that minor struggle, everything else was cool though. Sausages and beers on a Friday night, what else could a girl ask for?

The Tandoori Chicken flatbread was awesome and the wings were some of the best i've ever had. Their wings aren't chewy or fatty or drenched in sauce. They are grilled and just delicious!! 
Great job Vig. Let's work on that red sangria!  ;-)",2010-07-24 02:13:03

At the time I was a vegetarian, so I was stuck with the salad bar at the back and standing up to the jokes from my colleagues.  I was able to keep my spirits lifted with the endless bottles of wine that kept coming to the table.

I have since returned as a meat eater and while I haven't been able to eat everything there, I cannot believe how much meat people can pack in!  Or I can pack in.  Nobody told me about this thing called the ""meat sweats"" when I started eating meat again.  I also was not consuming portions that were large enough for me to experience it.  

The amount of meat and variety that they bring out is impressive.  I have never seen beef being cut off from a giant skewer with cheese oozing out of the centre!  They tell you what options they have and will bring it out based on what you want.  Out come the giant hot skewers that they hold next to your plate and cut off slices of meat that land on your plate.  

The fried pineapple at the end was quite tasty and they bring as much corn bread out as you want.   The salad bar was ok, but that's not what you come for.

The live entertainment is also another added element of fun.  Make sure you go with an empty stomach and cab money to get you home.",2011-08-09 18:45:36

BUT I WILL make an exception for this restaurant. Hopefully that speaks volumes. 

This restaurant (owned by Bobby Flay) is located on the casino floor of Caesar's Palace. It's easy to miss unless you're really looking for it. I feel like this restaurant is underrated and can be easily overshadowed by the many restaurants that Caesar's Palace offers. 

One of the main reasons why I come here is the breakfast/brunch menu. I seriously cannot get enough of their Smoked Salmon and Dill Quesadilla. It has the perfect amount of smoked salmon and cheese and the creme fraiche is delicious. Their Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale is fantastic as well as their Wild Striped Bass and Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. I would definitely like to try the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles (a somewhat new discovery from my Mexican friends) and the Spicy Scrambled Eggs. As if you couldn't already tell I'm a sucker for spicy foods...as well as smoked salmon. I was also told that the Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle is to die for as well. 

I honestly haven't had anything that doesn't taste good at this restaurant. The service is prompt and attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is fantastic. I haven't had a complaint yet. Try this place out and you won't be disappointed! Good job, Bobby Flay!",2012-07-09 00:07:06

The owner was amazingly sweet as she guided me through what I could and couldn't have with my tomato allergy.    I ended up having a corn tamale with chicken, cheese and creama.  It was FANTASTIC!!!     

My two friends had burritos and they enjoyed them very much.   

They had an amazing choice of empanadas- from savory to sweet, and a great menu of burritos, taquitos, quesadillas, enchiladas, and tamales. 

This place is NOT, I repeat, NOT ideal for a sit down lunch/dinner.   It is delightfully decorated, however, the  5 tables fit two people each and there is not a lot of elbow room with more than a few people inside.  They do have tables & chairs set up outside, which will be very nice when the weather is cooler.  

It's unfortunate that we had a pack of screaming, running pre-schoolers coming in and out and in and out and squeezing between tables of people trying to enjoy their meals... complete sensory overload for me, but this wasn't the owners fault... just don't bring your kids if they can't sit- it's not Chucky Cheese, Peter Piper or a McDonald's people!

I have been to many other bubble tea places in Vegas and this place is still my favorite spot. The drinks are ALWAYS consistent no matter who's working. I never had a single drink that I didn't like or had to make any adjustments to my drinks. 

I have waaay too many favorites here but my new favorite and go-to is their iced Yerba Mate tea w/ sea salt cream half sweet (thank you Mara :)). I'm not sure how to describe their mate but it has a distinct and earthy taste. Another tea recommendation I have is their Oolong tea (the black/smokey one over the green tea one). If you want something sweet , you can never go wrong with their classic Brew milk tea , Hokkaido or Okinawa. Their mate is quite caffeinated but their cold brew w/ sea salt cream is very very good if you want coffee. It's similar to Vietnamese iced coffee but not as sweet. I absolutely love their cold brew because it doesn't give insulin dump like coffee you get from other places.

They have the highest quality tea that is made upon ordering (none of that powdered stuff). When a place has over 800 reviews and still maintains a 5 star rating that's really impressive. I can't wait for their new menu to come out too. I'm always willing to drive the 20-30 minutes just for their drinks here :9 Brew is the best.",2017-03-01 07:07:53

I am so glad we decided to come here over the Turf.  When someone else is paying, you should ALWAYS choose the more expensive place.  I am so glad that we finally made it here.

Aside from the price being a bit of a deterrent for me, I am really picky and there are lots of things on the menu that don't particularly make me salivate.  That being said, I came here with no objections and an open mind.  Plus, after watching so much Hell's Kitchen, I wanted to know what good, fresh pasta tastes like.  I found out that it actually tastes like heaven.

I chose the gnocchi alla lupa (I think it is called that) which was decadent little pillows of potato dumplings covered in a beautiful sausage ragu.  Wow.  The perfect little potato clouds were practically melt in your mouth.  I am so going to try making these at home now that I know how incredible they can be.  The portion was a perfect size, leaving me very satisfied.  After tasting the pasta here, I understand the price point.  It is perfectly fair considering the excellent quality and workmanship of the delicious pasta.  

My husband and mother in law both got the lunch special.  One of them had the cavatelli with pesto and the other had cavatelli with pomodoro sauce.  Both of these dishes were delicious as well.  I really appreciated the lightness of the pesto sauce.  I didn't feel like I was ingesting a few cloves of garlic per bite.  It was a very season appropriate dish.  We were less than impressed with the salads though.  The odd pairing of ingredients made for a less than appetizing side.  This group is not a fan of celery, which could be the reason why we didn't like the salad.  I wouldn't suggest the lemonade, it was incredibly tart, and almost to the point of not being drinkable.

Overall, I was very pleased with this place.  I will be back again when I am feeling rich.  If PastaBAR ever decides to add a lovely cream sauce to their menu, I will definitely make this a five star restaurant in my book.  Another wonderful restaurant to add to the burgeoning strip of foodie heaven along 1st street.",2009-03-21 21:30:25

We ordered the chicken and waffles (soooo good! The waffles weren't the usually weird soggy mess, but instead almost like crunchy, yes fluffy pancakes from a waffle mould).

I'm a fan now. What's more is I think I could be friends with the owner. Anyone who puts up pictures of Audrey Hepburn and Julia Child, two icons I've always respected, in the ladies' rooms is good peoples. The vibe here is very warm and welcoming. One of the owners greeted me at the door with ""Get yourself out of the cold!"" I liked how even though he was wearing a plaid shirt and casual pants, he wasn't taking away from the upscale vibe. The only thing he took away was pretentiousness.

Love the not too daunting menu. My gal pals and I split the country pate--made with ground chicken. It was very good but I liked the other things on the plate--cheese, pickles, sundried tomato and fried capers. Their brussel sprouts appetizer was very yummy. The sprouts were cooked just right. 

I had the beef bourguignon shepherd's pie. Perfect with the nippy weather. Mashed potatoes of course were piped on top. You could taste some wine the sauce which really makes a difference--in a good way. Meat was tender enough. One friend had the chicken and dumplings which had a nice flavor. I'd go back to try that. My other friend had tender short rib with a red wine reduction. It was excellent--texture, taste of the reduction. Hope to go back to try that as my entree. My friend got a side of mac n'cheese with pancetta/bacon. It was decent. They don't use very sharp cheese for those that prefer cheddar. It wasn't quite as good as Bliss/Rebar mac n'cheese. 

As for dessert, we had that picked out before the appetizers. Chocolate-dipped bacon 'smores were the crowning touch. Marshmallows were toasty and gooey. It came with some whipped peanut butter that was heaven with the graham cracker and marshmallow. The bacon and chocolate was really good together. Though the bacon was a little too salty. There were a few bites where I somehow tasted more bacon than chocolate and the saltiness was a bit overpowering. But everything together was just scrumptious.

Yup, they're more expensive and take a while to make. Think of it as a custom blend sausage, not a mass produced hotdog. And skip the Kobe dog. Most anything labeled Kobe will be a disappointment unless it's an actual Kobe steak.

Try what I had instead, the BBQ pulled pork dog. Pork belly dog, bbq pork shoulder in a too sweet sauce that needed more tang, smoked gouda, caramelized onions, and slaw on a split top bun. Seriously, can you get any of that shit at your usual hotdog vendor? If so, count yourself lucky. The pork belly dog tastes good, the pulled pork's a little too sweet, but if your mouth is big enough to get all the ingredients in one bite, it all comes together w/ the cheese offsetting the sweet pulled pork, the slaw adding crunch and the rest adding flavor.

Huilacoche guacamole, chorizo bondito, trout tostado. Braised short rib especiales, and for me the machaca taquitos that come with corn tortillas ao you can make tacos fyi! All scrumptious.

So what does a hungry girl want when she's freezing and starving? Deep fried pickles, sticky toffee pudding, and scotch of course. (My server said that was probably the best order she'd ever heard.) These were hands down the best deep fried pickles I've ever had. They were crisp and perfectly cooked and the breading stayed on through each bite. I opted for tartar sauce instead of ranch  and I was really happy with my choice. 

The sticky toffee pudding was also delightful! It reminded me of a warm caramel macchiato from Starbucks...so creamy and delicious with a little ice cream and whip. 

What really made the experience fun was that it was karaoke night - I was there by myself so there was plenty of entertainment!

Samosas, Saag, Chicken Tikka, Basmati, Tandoori Chicken, and more along with a little salad bar with some Gulab Jamun.  The Naan was probably the highlight as it was super tasty and came out piping hot.

Now for the con's:  The food is extremely bland.  There wasn't an ounce of spice (as in spiciness) and everything (expect the Naan) tasted pretty much the same.  For those who are looking for un-Americanized Indian-food, you indubitably know that this is a big ""no-no"" as far as Indian food goes.

But let me talk about the real winners of the meal: the sides and the main courses. You know when people say Filet tastes like butter? Well now I know what they mean. I have never tasted anything so tender in my life. The short ribs are so perfectly cooked that you don't need a knife to enjoy it (maybe a little elf magic helped the chefs create these culinary creations!?) Finally, the sides. Oh the sides! Truffle mashed potatoes. They are expensive and come in a very small kettle. However, it's so rich in flavor and butter that it can easily fill up two people, especially with accompanying sides and an entree. The mac 'n cheese is just as delicious. Between those two sides, a salad and an entree, I could easily have called this my last supper and been happily content in life.",2011-12-07 05:15:48

It looks like it's been there far longer with its antique tiles, reclaimed wood and stained glass salvaged from an old church, and let's not forget its day of the dead charm. This quaint cantina serves up elevated Mexican cuisine from all over the map. Think, Mundo with less fuss and more character. 

Walking down the narrow entry, I felt like I was whisked off to Play del Carmen or some other Mexican coastal town. Suddenly, Fremont Street was a distant memory. I was taken with the striking bar that serves up more than 100 tequilas and an extensive list of margaritas made with fresh fruit puree. I was unable to resist the prickly pear ($9). 

While seated I loved how sunlight filled the space from the patio doors being perched open, and I enjoyed the warm breeze wafting in. It was a pleasant way to enjoy my refreshing prickly pear margarita served on the rocks; the perfect blend of sweet and tart. It was a great choice to wash down the house chips and salsa. The salsa had a smoky flavor with a slight hint of heat. 

Next, came the carnitas ($11). Three tacos topped with pickled onions and cilantro, served with a side of rice and beans. The carnitas were flavorful and tender. I had no complaints. Everything was tasty and well executed.

Overall, the restaurant lends itself to meals shared with friends and family. It's a great place to get an evening started or relaxing place to enjoy a leisurely lunch or weekend brunch.",2014-03-06 18:08:51

Since we went for tea, we ended up only getting a chocolate torte, lemon torte, croissant, thai chai, hot chocolate and white mocha. Please, please do get the tortes. The chocolate one was rich but with a fine balance of cocoa and sweetness. The lemon one was a fantastic explosion of citrus loveliness.

The service was ok and that's probably due to holiday rush and lack of servers during for taking their time off. I ordered the lobster bisque for starters. It was very delicious and rich. However, it was bit more salty then how I usually prefer. The lobster pieces were in good amount and the meat was tender.

The main entree consisted of 24Oz porterhouse (med-rare), Bordeaux, asparagus, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and three different dipping sauces for the steak.

You really have to be insane to not love those things (sorry my vegan friends but y'all are kooked) but there was just way too much salt on the fries and it was intense.

If the rumors are true about competition moving into the South Side maybe they'll do a nice remodel of this place and add some space.  

If it weren't for the awful placement of the bus stop that seems to draw some trashy people and the constant blaring of music from people showing off their cars in the parking lot, it might actually feel a lot safer to walk to and from the store.  

For such a prime area as the South Side, it's such an odd location to have a plaza with stores in it.

There are always some really interesting flavors going on and Destihl really does distinguish itself above its competitors, the other sort of new american or gastropub restaurants.

Destihl does brew its own beer and it's generally pretty good, always a very reasonable price. You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.

This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. 
Must Have.

I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!! My bun did come out quite burnt, but the rest of the burger made up for it.
I'd get it again in a heartbeat.

I must also mention about the mirror in the guys washroom. It's like a large TV for ads.  Pretty impressive.

Food wise, the food doesn't come with any sides, so you will have to order the sides as well if you want things such as potato or veg or etc .   I have the rib eye.  It tasted really WOW.  For the price, I would say it's very amazing.  (Though the higher end steaks from Costco would taste just as good).

Second, this place was loud inside. It was hard to hear the people at the other end of the table. That's really my only gripe about the place. Overall for service, the waitress was very helpful and as prompt as possible. And, they kept my pop & water full... which I always think is a big plus for the service. 

I did not imbibe any adult beverages so I will have to save that for another review. 
However, I did enjoy lots of food. 
Started with the onion rings. The batter is kind of light and crispy and the seasoning they put on them is good! Came with a sauce that paired well. You get about 6 large rings to an order so share with someone else (or maybe a few others). 
I also had a taste of the sweet potato fries which were very good as well as the truffle fries, which I didn't care for as much.... but truffle oil is kind of something I just don't love. 

Ok, now for the good part.. the burgers. 
Both my husband and I really enjoyed the burgers here. The waitress told us at the beginning that all the burgers are cooked med to med-well unless otherwise specified.. I thought this was strange, but I figured I'd go with it. 
I ordered the Black and Bleu burger. This burger comes with these port infused carmelized onions and some really creamy bleu cheese. I thought it was delicious. And you can tell the beef was high quality in this burger. 
My hubs got the Chili Pepper Burger - not super spicy, not super mild. Had a really nice tang from the pickled jalapenos. It came with some spicy ketchup which complimented the burger well. 
Despite thinking it was strange they dictate how ""done"" the burger is.. I have to say.. they hit it on the head for both our burgers - even though I am usually a fan of a much more ""moo-ing"" burger. 
I will definitely be back. Next time I need to save room for the ""Vanilla Date"" milkshake... because that just sounds awesome.",2015-07-10 01:04:48

We each ordered a combo which was very decently priced - 16 dollars for ANY drink, savoury or sweet crepe, and a crepe cake! We both ordered flavoured lattes, rose and taro, and I have never been more disappointed latte-wise. It was lukewarm and tasted like diluted coffee with zero rose or taro flavour. I got the mushroom crepe, and it was actually pretty yummy but not outstanding you know? It was weirdly HUGE in size, like literally put two hands finger tips to finger tips. LOL The crepe cake was what they are known for so the matcha one was really flavourful and creamy. But it was served FIRST before the crepes? It was awkward because me and my friend both ordered crepes...but literally, mine came 15 minutes after. Lastly, we got the infamous cotton candy coffee as seen on IG. The person who set it up for us set the cotton candy way too low so it touched the coffee. We had to fix it for the photos.

The times that I have seen a show, I couldn't have been more pleased. The ticket prices are reasonable, there is plenty of room to stand or even sit and see the show, the sound is top-notch, and as an added bonus there is a large bar in the stage area. When it is not extremely crowded (more on that later), the lounge area is an excellent choice to have a few drinks, smoke on their patio, and I have heard the food is pretty good, too. I have no complaints about it when it is a slower weekday night. 
Crescent has been extremely successful and I am very happy to see it do so well. However, on nights of popular shows, or on Saturday nights when they do Kismet, the place is packed. Like WAY too packed. Takes ages to get a drink, and once you do have it, you have to drink it while being pushed and shoved by everyone around you. My biggest complaint though, is the bathroom situation. In the lounge area, there is one toilet. For everyone. This leads to a very long line of people that have been drinking and really need to pee. Also, you're talking about drunk people here, so people have no respect and are constantly cutting in the line or using the private locking bathroom for ""recreational"" activities. The last time that I was there, it was a Saturday night and I was standing in line for the bathroom. I had been waiting for awhile, when 4 or 5 people rushed into the bathroom. They were in there for-EVER and when they finally opened the door, an enormous amount of pot smoke was rolling out into the main area. Ummmm...believe it or not, it's not funny to hotbox a public bathroom and some people don't actually want a contact high, jackasses.  It was absolutely disgusting having to use that bathroom afterwards. Not to mention, the bathroom there is almost always very dirty, toilet paper everywhere, and everything is always wet. It's gross. I know that Crescent can't control what its customers do, but I hope that they are making plans to add another bathroom or porta-potties or have a way for everyone to use the restrooms in the stage area, or SOMETHING because it really is my only complaint about Crescent Ballroom.",2012-01-12 18:05:05

When I was a local, my wife and I frequented this place often for dinner, gaming, and movies.  On a recent trip back to the Valley I decided to stay at GVR for a night.  Very glad I did.  The standard room is nice, larger than the standard room I had been in the previous three nights at Harrah's.  Great bathroom with a separate soaking tub and shower stall.  Also, the water closet is private from the rest of the bathroom, which is nice.  Comfortable bed, large TV with plenty of options.  This was a nicely appointed room.

GVR has a good sized casino for a locals' joint and most nights has plenty of $5 games.  I was there on a Sunday, I never saw more than one craps game going, although to be fair I didn't gamble much after 8:00 pm.  So, they may have opened another one later in the evening.  There is double deck pitch blackjack with good rules but only average penetration.  

GVR has a couple of good restaurants:  Hank's, the steakhouse, and Tides, the oyster bar.  They are adding a Pizza Rock, which I like, so that will be another great addition.  The food court is standard fare for a Station Casino:  Fatburger, Capriotti's, Panda Express, Tropical Smoothie Café.  They are putting in another pizza joint, which seems redundant to me, but a place for quick slices is never a bad idea I suppose.  I've been to Grand Café, but it's been years.  That place was just average then, but like I said, it's been a long time.  The buffet is solid for a locals' joint, better than Sunset or Fiesta.  But, if I am going to consume that many calories, I want to make it worth it, so I'd drive to Caesars and eat Bacchanal.

Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at GVR.  I came here quite a bit as a local, and I can see myself coming back quite a bit now that I don't live in Vegas.  Recommended.",2014-11-20 23:49:46

After looking online at ratings for local dealers then checking the company websites for affordable vehicles and doing my budget in lieu of this unexpected need, I settled on a vehicle at Coulter Tempe.

I've been working on my credit for the last 8 years and finally have an excellent rating.  I also had a bit of cash that I could put down on the vehicle since I'm saving to buy my first home next year.  I should've been an easy sell.  In and out in 20- 30 mins. 

The experience started out wonderfully.  I submitted an online inquiry for the vehicle I was interested in, and contacted next day to set up an appointment to see the car and talk pricing.  The expectation set was that the car was at ""our sister site, but we can have it brought here no problem.  Ask for the sales manager Dennis.""  

When I got to the place, I was greeted outside by Joe.  I let him know the car I was interested in and asked if 'Dennis' was a manager there.  He told me ""no.""  So I thought I'd incorrectly remembered the name of the manager I was supposed to ask for. Joe took me into his office to pull up my online request. I told him about my credit and such.  He confirmed that the vehicle was at a different site and would need to be brought to their location.  He offered to show me some vehicles they had on site for an expedited response. He said he'd get me some good deals.  I told him I didn't want to pay on the car for more that 4 yrs and that I had a budget I wanted to stay within.  

Joe offered to show be a car that I'd seen online and knew was $5000 over budget from the grunt work Id done before coming to the site.  Test drove.  It was nice indeed.  But too costly.  Even with his 'good deal.' 

Next attempt was to sell me another, more expensive, vehicle which was 2 years older w/ dings around the housing and w/ double the mileage of the vehicle I came in ready to purchase.  30min visit became an 1 1/2 hour. He said he could get it for me at $25 more than I wanted to spend monthly in financing.  I didn't accept that so he brought in his manager- Dennis-  yep, Dennis. 

Dennis guaranteed me that this older car is superior to the one I'm interested in.  He says ""take it home tonight, do some research, drive it back tomorrow.  If you don't like it we will get you into the car you wanted.""  By now I'd spent 2 hours in this place with nothing to show for it. So I agreed and signed off on paperwork.

I called back the next day and am told Dennis is gone home for the day.  The vehicle hasn't been relocated.  

The following day I get a voicemail from Joe saying the vehicle was sold.  I go onto the Coulter Nissan site and see it's still listed and take screenshots.  The price was even cheaper on this site.  I follow up w/ Joe and he says he'll investigate it further.  He calls back and tells me they got the car and that it now costs more than the price that it was listed as on Coulter Tempe's website because of a trade in promo.  ""Come in tonight to pick it up.""  So I called Coulter Nissan pretending to be a new customer to get a price quote and they proved that was a lie.  

When I got to Coulter Tempe to pick up the car.  Dennis told me that the higher price was his final price and that he was only having the conversation because he told me he would last time we met.  What arrogance!?  You mean these 3 days I've spent with this process is a courtesy?  How about doing the right thing and following up on the expectation YOU SET?!  I continued the conversation with Joe and told him it was unfair practice to sell at a higher cost than the asking price on their website.  The price I was asking for was already higher than the price on Coulter Nissan's site.  If I'd gone there to get it in the first place, I'd have been way better off.  He comes back and finally gets me the vehicle for the Coulter Tempe online price.  

it's frustrating, the amount of time it took to get the vehicle at the online asking price. You would have thought they'd offer some type of compensation for the waste of my time but instead they kept pushing for more money.  This place, and that 'manager,' should be ashamed of their business tactics.",2015-08-26 22:39:59

When I first walked in there was a Taco Cart...nice!!!  There was a choice of pastor, chicken or steak.  I got two steak tacos to start.  The steak tacos were really good.  I also heard people raving about the pastor but I am not a big pastor fan.

I also went to the bar and asked for a Margarita.  I also told that bartender that I did not like the mix and I was able to get mine made with fresh squeezed lime.  That makes me and my stomach happy!  The staff was very fast getting drinks even thought the place was packed from wall to wall.

I went in back to check out the buffet and picked up a taste of everything.  The food was really good and it had been sitting for a while in the heating trays.  I would love to come back here and order off of the menu one day!

My favorite part of the whole night was the Mariachi Band...these three guys were the Mexican Version of the Three Stooges.  They were so funny and they played every and all requests.  Our whole group was laughing so hard.  I asked for some Pink Floyd and they started playing Brick in the Wall.  I kept thinking...what have I done but the room loved it.  These guys were so much fun.  I asked at the front and they told me that these guys play on the weekend.  I really want to come back and listen to these guys again!!!

There was also a cardboard cut out of the Dos Equis Guy...if you angled the camera correctly it kind of looked like he was real.  In fact, a few people of facebook thought he was real and were surprised when I told them he was really cardboard.

The service is very organized, you give the cashier your order and through microphone she tells your order to the kitchen staff. The kitchen is open, which is nice. After your order has been boxed, a different person opens each box and shows you your food to make sure you get what your order. Service is fast and efficient.

The braised beef soup was good.  It was a generous portion.  Thick pieces of meat, lots of noodles, and a nice broth.  The broth was light.  It isn't as hearty as Pho.  I don't think I can eat it everyday like I can Pho.  The meat was soft and tasted good.  There are tons of noodles which I didn't finish.  I know everyone makes a big deal about how the noodles are fresh and made everyday.  Eh -- I don't think that's really important.  It is pretty annoying when they are making it and slamming the dough on the table every few minutes.

Their dumplings were good.  I tried several different kinds.  They were a little small but I found them to be tasty.

Their braised pork with rice was really good.  It had a side of boiled egg and some pickled vegetable.  There was a little too much fat on the pork but I found it delicious.

I tried their black tea flavored tapioca milk tea with grass jelly and coconut jelly.  I am pretty disappointed at the taste.  I didn't think it was very good and tasted nothing like tapioca milk tea.  

I came here during a Wed and Satruday.  Saturday was super busy.  I don't think I saw my waitress again after the initial ordering.  The Wednesday was slower.  But I had an issue with my drink.  The support staff to the waitress doesn't seem to know what they're doing.  But the waitress was extremely nice.

It was not my first choice to go to..honestly I'd only seen this place in passing on my way to the airport.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, nice big building on the corner of Paradise and Flamingo on the Northwest side.  Walking in, however, you feel transported to another place with the Caribbean theme of the restaurant and bar.

However, like a friend has told me, you can't necessarily paint something to make it what it ain't.

The food here is expensive for what you get.  We ordered quite a bit of food for the party: Spinach Dip and Island Chips, Island Onion Rings, West Indies Patties, and Creole Baked Goat Cheese to start.  None of these, to me, were particularly good.  The Spinach Dip was not even touched as my friend ordered it and then tried to pass it along to everyone else because she hated it.  The entree's were a little better: Cuban Sandwich and Margarita Chicken.  However for the $10 and $15 plates of food, I've had much better.

The service was slow for a slow Wednesday early evening dinner.  It was nice that we were able to sit in the atrium outside that was nicely cooled.

The husband ordered oatmeal.... you know, nothing crazy. I ordered an egg sandwich on a bagel. We both got coffees (a latte and a dirty chai).... The prices were high, especially for what you get (5$ for oatmeal....8$ for egg on a bagel). We waited a long time for food.... apparently you have to pick up your coffee from the counter even though they give you a number for your food to be delivered to your table. We thought all would be delivered and were not listening for our drinks. When I went to investigate... one drink was on the counter... somewhat cold.... the other was missing completely. I asked for the drink to be remade, which they did without issue. The chai was subpar, far too sweet... I couldn't even finish it. When the food was finally delivered, we were disappointed to see the oatmeal was a bowl full of hot water with oats at the bottom. The water had not absorbed into the oats. When the husband inquired about this, the employee said that this was the way the oats were when they were very hot. Well... this was not acceptable. We returned the oats and they refunded the money (the right thing to do). The egg sandwich was nothing special.... just an egg and cheese on a bagel. Definitely not worth 8$.

I feel like other places have decent macarons now, but other places sell more cakes and other specialties, so Ruelo is still one of the better locations in Markham area. 

They have a wide variety of macarons, each macaron is different in price, which I find quite interesting. I wonder if some ingredients of the macarons are significantly more expensive than others. Nevertheless, they're still within the $2-$3 range per macaron. 

If you purchase 6 items, and you don't have tax! The macaron flavours that they offer here and I recommend are
- Ruelo (if you are a chocolate lover, I'm personally not one, but if you like chocolate, go for it)
- Green Tea Sesame (I don't really taste the sesame much)
- Rose Lychee Raspberry
- Pistachio Raspberry
- Early Grey (Sigh, I wish they would combine it with a non chocolate center)

Service: this is more service oriented than DJK because they cook the food for you (in front of you on the grill). I don't really like this, but my husband enjoys this level of service.

Ambiance: really cool how it's decorated so that you feel like you're in an outside street scene.

Cost: More expensive than DJK, so we call this the ""fancy BBQ place"".

Bottom line - food is better at DJK, but if you want a higher level of service and nicer environment, then go to Hobak.",2018-05-14 17:13:04

If you are looking for your little one to be more comfortable with the water then this is a good choice. For the older kiddos I'd suggest private lessons or another option as the classes are just not  long enough for the amount of kids they get and focusing on each one to learn how to swim is more difficult for the young instructors.,2016-08-10 13:15:08

I shared the PG's Bowl and the A Hui Hou Bowl. I really enjoyed the A Hui Hou Bowl. The crab slaw was a pleasant surprise and the honey ginger salmon was a really nice marinade. We also got wasabi mayo and spicy aioli as a sauce. I probably could've went for a little less sauce, but it didn't bother me at all. The wasabi mayo was quite delicious.

The pancakes were not the same fluffy ones I had the first time.  This time they were dry and the bottoms were burnt (my mistake not taking a picture of the bottom to show you).  How sad when my first experience was so fantastic.

But the real reason I'm giving one star now compared to four before, is because of the HORRIBLE service we received.  We were there around 830ish and there were only 3 other tables sitting beside us.  There were 2 staff working that night.  We asked for the bill and then both staff disappeared into the back.  A couple came in waited about 5-10 minutes with NO one coming to the front.  They decided to sit down themselves.  Then it must have been about 15 minutes later and they just decided to leave.  Finally someone showed up and he was busy clearing the table of another couple and then proceeded to help the guy sitting at the bar.  At this point is had been about 25 minutes that we were waiting for the bill and I literally had my arm extended (my arms are long) and waving in the air to get their attention for about 2 straight minutes.  Keep in mind that this place is NOT big and we honestly think the staff was purposely ignoring us or not looking in our direction because they were ""busy.""  

Finally the guy comes over and says sorry he forgot to get us the bill. By this time a good 30 minutes have passed. He returns and we tell him we need the machine.  He comes back another 5 minutes later with the machine that does NOT work and says he has to get the other machine.  All in all it took about 45 mintues from the time we asked for the bill and then for us to pay and leave.  Completely outrageous considering the place was not even half full, but somehow the 2 staff seemed to be incredibly busy.  I'm sorry but wtf are you doing in the back for that long and leaving the restaurant completely unattended? 

By the way, we came for dessert and only ate the pancakes.  When you know you left customers waiting for 45 minutes to bring them the bill AND you and the other staff member disappeared to the back for over 20 minutes, I feel that you should offer some sort of discount.  Not that I expect free food, but I think it would have been nice for them to just comp the meal considering it was less than 20 bucks.

Generally speaking, as far as Wal-Mart stores go, this is the nicest one in the area. The one at Marks is super busy. The one at Lake Mead/Boulder is small, pretty old and ghetto.  

As much as I try to stay away from Wal-Mart, there's no denying that some prices are the number one motivating factor for coming here. I mean, if I need groceries, pet food, and/or baby items, it's just convenient. We go to Target much more, but the selection of groceries is a little limited- I can't get fruit or vegetables there, unless it's frozen. Came here on a saturday night, so yes, it was crowded. Overheard some people saying ""I hate Wal-Mart!"" We were in the middle of the aisles, where there were displays, so pushing a cart with our baby tucked inside, and avoiding other customers, was sort of tricky. But we didn't stay long. This is the key when visiting Wal-Mart stores. Get in, get your stuff, and get out. This cuts down on the frustration factor.

Also must say that there is an excellent CRAFTS section here with a myriad of fabrics for the crafting enthusiast (such as myself). If you peruse the other aisles, you will come across the CLEARANCE section. Jo-Ann's is a lot more pricier for fabrics.

The store is practically brand new (since Downtown Summerlin, which it is located in, just opened to the public not even 20 days ago), but you can tell the staff puts in extra effort in keeping the displays, shelves, aisles and the store in near photo shoot ready state.  In spite of the huge crowd of customers that descends upon the store in the afternoon.  Clear indicator that they collectively are proud and more than likely happy to be working at this Trader Joe's.

The overall selections and prices of items here are just as good and reasonable as other Trader Joe's.  The quality and freshness of perishable items here however seem to be of extra high quality.

The atmosphere ------ L-O-U-D!!! 

Service was fine.. nothing amazing... or over the top. The guy taking care of us did a nice job. 

The food....

We had the shrimp and grits appetizer.  It was good.. not amazing... just good. 

My wife, who isn't a steak fan, had the chicken.  Again... it was fine... but.. Nothing amazing. 

I had the cowboy rib eye.  It was slightly over cooked.. not tough, but not melt-in-your mouth.....amazing.  Lacked seasoning...  and if I'm 100% honest... I've made rib eyes at home that were as good or better...   the Béarnaise helped along with the onion strips. 

All in all...  the bill was $165 .. not a huge amount but the meal and experience didn't live up to the bill. Not even close... it was a mediocre experience at best. 

My advice... either cook a great cut of steak at home the way you love it... or make reservations at other steak houses in Las Vegas.  This place just didn't do it for us... it didn't live up to the hype IMO.

I went in after the lunch rush (around 2:15ish) and there was a manager walking around and directing patrons to menus and answering questions. Before I went in, I had taken some time to look at the menu online so I knew what I wanted. I ordered the santa fe salad with the chipotle vinaigrette dressing on the side. The chipotle vinaigrette has a spicy kick, like VERY spicy. 

If you are a Chop't newbie, I highly suggest looking at the menu online to get a feel of what they already offer and it'll give you a chance to look over the ingredients in case you want to come up with your own salad creation. The salads are HUGE and I'm able to get two separate meals out of them. With the size, there comes a price. My santa fe salad (with the addition of grilled chicken) came to just under $10. I don't really consider that price too bad considering Zaxby's charges $8 for a salad that's 1/3 of the size.

Love this location. They are super friendly & they don't give me a weird look when I ask for my specifications on my order. 

Everything inside looked clean & tidy.

FAJITA STEAK BOWL is my choice always & they always make it good... can't really make it wrong when they are putting together my dish right there & then. I would have to say their serving portion for the meat has gotten smaller so i ordered extra but the extra up charge was only around $2.50 which is fine by me for a double scoop. 

I THINK this place is cheaper on the price for an extra scoop but don't quote me cuz i am not 100%

I came in to grab something for lunch, and decided on a sandwich made with fixings from their deli.  Everything looked really high quality and delicious!  I stood at the sandwich counter for a while, trying to get someone's attention.  One employee came and sat down on the counter in front of me and started doing something on his cell phone.  I gave him a few minutes to finish what he was doing, but didn't even get so much as a ""hello"".  Another staff member was talking on the landline.  It's a small store, and I would understand if they were busy with other customers, but I was the only one there and I felt extremely ignored.  The guy on the landline got off the phone eventually and took my sandwich order.  

The sandwich itself was a let down.  It appeared that they combined all of the condiments from ALL of the sandwiches on their list onto my sandwich.  It had mustard, mayo, horseradish, vegetable spread, and olive tapinade.  A few of these condiments go together, but the last three certainly didn't.  And all three weren't even supposed to be on my sandwich, so it wasn't what I was expecting.  The bread was extremely dry and tasted almost stale.  It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had.

Oh well, it sounds like there are lots of other great products in the store.  And they support other local businesses which I like.  They seem to have a good philosophy, and unfortunately I probably just caught them at a bad time.

The service may be horrible and the lack of acknowledgement pissed me off, the food we ordered is what I'm reviewing. It might just be Winterlicious stress or whatever but if I ever go here again when it's not and the service is the same, Negative stars are coming right up.

I ordered the Pate de Campagne, Rose Penne, & Peach Melba.
My friend ordered the Soup of the Day (Vegan Friendly), Seafood Pasta, and Creme Brulee.

Pate de Campagne (4.5*)
Knocked off half a star cause when it says its going to have Gherkins, I expect more than one and that wasn't the case :/ The pate was smooth with varrying textures and delicious. The bread was fragrant and when eaten together the sensational herby taste was gorgeous. The sweet salad paired with honey mustard sauce (i think?) was refreshing for the tastebuds. Just really wish I had more sour ghekins otherwise this would've been the greatest starter ever.

Rose Penne (5/5*)
Had nice and smooth tender chicken that wasn't dry and the penne was al dente but more on the harder side which I liked but I'm not sure if other people would liked that. You could definately taste the Rose Pernod in the sauce which blew me by surprise that I loved every bite. Wish I had some wine to pair with this great dish but decided to stick to my water.

Peach Melba (1/5*)
Too painfully sweet, the chocolate sauce made it kinda dry feeling somehow??? But the 1 star is definately there for that vanilla icecream scoop but maybe thats just me.

Soup of the Day (2/5*)
Good but not great, was more on the cooler warm side, both of us would've prefferred it a little hotter. 

Seafood Pasta (5/5*)
Also one of the best three dishes Ive tried today. Gorgeous seafood taste, the aroma hits you immediately as you out it in your mouth. Each bite has you eating more and more. The shrimp and mussels were cooked to perfection and the fettucini was peefectly al dente.

Creme Brulee (5/5*)
The vanilla and cardamom really popped out in the brulee that my friend was practically licking the ramekin LMAO I loved it as well but I wish the sugar on top was a bit thicker as I love texture in my creme brulee but thats okay!

Definately looking forward to coming back here!!!",2017-02-05 04:47:17

They have all the recent movies and many showings besides they also have many rooms so the possibility of getting there and the tickets are sold out it is pretty small.
I love REGAL in general for the points you get when you buy tickets, I am at the movies at least once a week and I am always getting free popcorn through my REGAL points.

Service was fantastic--our waiter, Sean, was excellent, and attentive, bringing us whiskey to sample when we were iffy about a drink order and letting us know why there was a slight delay on our food (one we honestly would not have noticed).

We started with the flatbread, which was perfectly cheesy and oily, with an excellent garlic puree to lather on.  I am incredibly not-picky beer drinker, but I had the IPA, which I very much enjoyed.  The star of this meal was the thai fried chicken.  OH MY GOODNESS.  So moist and delicious, with a crunchy, spicy skin and citrusy juices soaked up with peppers and rice.  I'm drooling just remembering it.  I'll certainly be ordering this again.

Based on other comments, I'd say Destihl is rapidly working the kinks out with some of their menu items.  I had the strawberry goat cheese salad mentioned below and thought all together it was excellent, except for the candied nuts, which were a bit odd--covered in powdered sugar, I think, which was the one element that didn't completely meld for me.  Regardless, I cleaned my plate.

I completely disagree with the comment about small portions.  I think the portions here are ample!  Our $4 flatbread had 6 good-sized pieces, the $5 salad covered the entire medium-sized plate, the $11 pizza has fed me for 3 meals now, and the $15ish chicken entree came with about half a chicken (and probably would have made it through a few days of leftovers if it weren't so damn good).  Altogether, we spent $57 for a two-person meal that included appetizers and beer (and tax, and tip).  

I'm really, really pleased that Destihl has come to Champaign and I applaud them for having a nearly packed house on a Monday night.  Since my first visit, the service and food have both gotten better, and I hope they continue to improve!  Such an excellent addition to downtown Champaign!",2011-07-13 17:01:28

I made it inside and couldn't find a jacket one size larger. So I asked if they had something was of like, kind, and quality. The cashier looked and looked. She found nothing. She advised that the warehouse doesn't carry the jacket anymore. 

To my luck a manager just happened to walk by and I asked her if she could help us. I was desperate to get my wife another jacket. So we look and we find a similar, not same jacket. That jacket rang up for $147. The original was $104. She matched the jacket price and I even received 10% off.

It was our wedding anniversary and we wanted to recreate a fabulous dim sum meal we had in Hong Kong during our honeymoon. Needless to say it didn't live up to that epic feast but it was absolutely delicious.

We had their specialty soup-filled pork dumpings, pan fried pork dumplings, onion pancake roll with beef, wontons in spicy peanut sauce, and green beans with dried shrimp. The pancake roll was so yummy and even better when dipped in a bit of vinegar to cut the fat. The true star however was the wontons in spicy peanut sauce, I've never had anything like it (waiter said it's another specialty of theirs), the sauce was spicy creamy and nutty and the wontons had a deliciously tender skin and yummy pork filling.

Everything was delivered in a very timely fashion - in fact I would stagger our order more next time so that we have more time between dishes. However it was all hot, with the desired accompaniments (some vinegar, chili oil etc.) and some ice cold Tsingtao to wash it all down. 

Worth noting near the end of our meal there was a lady yelling for the manager at the back of the room. She was relentless and tried to force her way into the back of the kitchen but the staff dealt with the situation very professionally. Our waiter apologized to us for the disruption rather than ignoring it which I appreciated.

I can only describe my feelings for this product with an analogy. I don't like cheap beers like Keystone or Natty Ice, but sometimes the situation calls for it and, well,  it gets me drunk. If you asked me how much I liked it, I'd reply ""not at all"", but if you put one in my face at the right time, you bet I'm gonna chug it.

After a night of that, my friends and I would probably take a bunch of wadded up ones and spend them here. Obviously, they provide a necessary service--late night, cheap pizza for the drunk and stoned urban youths of Arizona State. For that, I'll be nice about the varying levels of disappointment I've been served here and hope they at least improve the crust.

But it usually always comes down to that I make a killer chili dog at home that no one could mess with and besides why would I pay someone for something I could do myself. Well, I finally gave in and gave Maui Dog a try based on some of the yelps. 

The location used to be a cheese steak joint and isn't the sleekest building on the block but who are we kidding, we only come for the food right? I ordered a Hana dog volcanic style (hotter mayo sauce), a spam slider Maui style (sweet with pineapples and stuff), and a side order of fries. The meal came out to over 10 bucks with a tip. 

The slider had a quarter inch thick slice of spam, which, I haven't had in about 15 years. The spam was on a sweet roll with a bunch of the toppings listed. It was good but not great. I am not a fan of sweet stuff to begin with but then it just kind of fell flat. I would recommend not getting it Maui style. Maybe it would be better if it was spicy. Or if they would sear the spam and give it a slight burnt/rcrisp coat it could be much better. 

The Hana dog was masterfully created. Absolutely delicious. Nice big dog, buried in bacon, avocado, pico, cilantro, on a sweet bun and the volcanic sauce was money. I will most definitely attempt to recreate this beast at home. 

The fries were very weak. They were soggy and filled with oil. The kind that your mom would attempt to make at home instead of the fast food version you wanted. I would suggest making them crispier and adding some seasoning. 

The man at the counter was as friendly as they come. He even came out and was checking everyone and how they were doing. He recommended adding some ghost powder to make the Hana dog even hotter. I may take him up on that. 

The bill was a bit much for the product. It came out to over 10 bucks with a tip. For a gourmet hot dog, a slider, and potato a 10 spot is a little excessive. However, with that being said, the dog was delicious and the guy at the counter provided excellent service so I would consider going back on that alone. At this point I recommend skipping the fries and slider altogether and sticking to the dogs.",2010-10-25 20:26:08

The salad was really the only thing I found a little lacking and that may have been because everything else was SO good.  The onion rings were hand dipped and fried in panko breadcrumbs, crispy and hot.  The ribs were fall off the bone and so lean!  The burger was melt in your mouth.  
The only issue I did  have was that seating was hard to come by for us and the other couple we came with.  Their son needed a highchair, so we ended up outside.

Day 2= while they completed my car they stated OnStar was draining my battery would co$t me 700 to fix. I contacted OnStar about product they informed me they have a recall on the part for gm just to fix it n send them the invoice (odd they didn't know this already I'm sure they just wanted my money) I 3 way nick and had them both speak. OnStar n Nick
Day 3= contacted nick inquire about car, they stated they never did this before n they don't know how to invoice OnStar. I contacted OnStar again got there supervisor to explain to them how to invoice.      
Later that day called nick again to see how its going, they stated they needed it approved by OnStar. So I call OnStar again for the 3rd time n had them speak with Scott, OnStar stated it didn't need to be approved to just do the work. ( odd again)
Day 4 = finished at 5pm when I was able to get it back.   

Beware= a couple things I didn't understand.
1. Why you guys didn't know OnStar had a recall. Have you just been making people pay?
2. Why did I have to follow up with OnStar and you, for you to do the work? As if you didn't want to do it.
3.   I have 2 children one that is only 1 month old n you left me with out a car for 4 days because you didn't know what the hell you guys were doing. Uncalled for n that's why you get 1 star.

I have been 15-20 times over the last 5 years and had just about everything on the menu. Perhaps because of this the negative reviews sort of infuriate me. Mesa Grill is not Chilis- yes they both proclaim to offer great southwestern food but Mesa Grill is a big girl restaurant- they don't serve southwest egg rolls or big mouth bites. They don't have a 20 page long menu with 5,000 items on it. Food costs more than 4.99 during happy hour.

Drinks
Regular margarita- I know a lot of people don't like to get adventerous with their drinks and if that is the case you can't go wrong with the house margarita- it is not as sweet as you may be used to with many places now putting agave nectar in their drinks but it is not face puckeringly bitter. 

Cactus Pear - this is the best by far. Yes it is pink, that doesn't mean it isn't manly. 


Appetizers- in Order

Blue Corn Lobster Tacos- Winner. These are so frigging good its ludicrous. I normally don't like relish, fennel or hananero and yet I love this relish. 

Blue Corn pancake- comes with tasty duck meat and a slightly spicy sauce

Chicken Black Bean Quesadilla- the garlic sauce that comes on this is slightly more addictive than heroin. 

Goat Cheese Queso- its not quite dippable queso but is also not actual gross fundido- pretty tasty. 


Entres- In order

Pork Tenderloin- this one is always on the restaurant week menu so I have had more than my fair share of it. it is super delicious. It comes with three different sauces on the plate (for three pieces of tenderloin) and they are all good. It also comes with a sweet potato tamale thing that is amazing.

Veal Chop- I don't like horseradich so I get it without- other than that this dish is perfect. I think the tamale is cheese (goat cheese?) - I'm not really sure because I inhaled it before I could figure it out. 

Bone in Ribeye- this is an outstanding steak for a non steak restaurant. Its like 50 bucks- less than you would pay at Carne Vino and the like. It has a really good smoky glaze on it so if you are a steak purist (only want meat taste) this is probablynot for you

First of all, usually when I come back to update a review, it's because I'm either adding or subtracting a star. Unfortunately after several more visits, I've realized that overall, I don't consider Deagan's a five-star establishment. Everything is very good, but nothing is really GREAT except the service. (But more on that later.)

I will reiterate that the Ohio Beef Burger is a joy to behold. Last time we went to Deagan's, I ate the entire burger. I never do that. But it was soooo friggin' delicious, I just had to.

I always enjoy their variety of beers on tap, although they are often out of several selections that either my husband or his friends want to try. I've enjoyed certain seasonal specials such as the Southern Tier Creme Brulee Stout -- that is one ridonkulous beer. But if there's nothing out there that really catches my fancy, I can always fall back on my staple, the Left Hand Milk Stout (Deagan's has the Nitro version).

Now about the service. I am very torn here. The waitresses and hostesses have ALWAYS been attentive, wonderful, accomodating to our baby, and just overall awesome. But last time, we waited for what seemed to be a pretty long time -- not that the waiting in and of itself was the problem ... it was that a group of five who came in after us got seated before we did -- I should say immediately -- even though there were five in our party. If there was a reservation involved, that's understandable, but these guys didn't seem to have one. We kind of just kept getting ignored until the table they ""had their eye on for us"" finally cleared out. Maybe it was because of the baby that they wanted a specific place for us, but the ironic part was that she was crankier during the wait than she was during the actual meal.

In any case, I still like Deagan's a lot, but I'm withholding the fifth star for certain things that aren'tfive-star quality to me. The food is solid, but not amazing.",2011-10-09 01:19:31

This was a must for my entire family, visitors, business associates, and I  would sing it's praises for years.  I felt it was as good as it gets.   Then, it changed owners.

The new owner, a Japanese lady, watches every serving and every thing the Chefs do. One by one, the good chefs left. Things got worse;

I was living in Maui, and used to fly back on Hawaiian Air every six weeks. I would send the crew from Hawaiian Air and every Islander I knew, to this place. 

One night, I came in and the owner thanked me for all the people I sent. To reward me, I asked if I could substitute seaweed salad for my Miso Soup, with my Sushimi Dinner. She said, ""That's expensive, and I would have to pay extra"". 

Bottom line; My son's girl friend called Sushi Mon ""the Mc Donald's of Sushi"".  She was right.  Read my review of Jjanga Japanese Grill. It's better quality, a little less money, and superior quality and service.

Also, you won't have to wait long for a table or seat at the bar.

This place is a high end japanese restaurant so don't expect to order the way you might at AYCE. For example, the miso soup alone is $6 and a small bottle of sake is about $50. But it's definitely quality over quantity. To start off, the fish is super fresh here (obviously or it wouldn't be so expensive). I give them points for creativity and as some dishes were delightfully surprising, some were plain out wrong (to me, of course). 
For starter plates, definitely try the miso cod (don't be shocked by the size, I was told it's considerably large). It was cooked perfectly! Melts in your mouth like butter. The seared tuna on top of crispy rice is good too. I wasn't a fan of the crispy rice part but the tuna was yummy.
Their rolls are really the stars there. Rolls you should order for sure: hot mess, fireball (hot!), pork belly and toro with scallions. Do not order the pop rock roll! It was recommended to us, and although I understand the concept is to have the watermelon pop rocks compliment the sushi, it did nothing but remind me that I was eating candy with sushi! I never liked pop rocks as a kid and I didn't like it in my dinner.
Atmosphere was nice and elegant. Service was impeccable. The hostess was really sweet about helping us with a high chair for my nephew and putting us at a good table. The server was helpful and recommended as best as she could. Even the food runners are really polite in presenting your dish.

Tip: They said it's a kid friendly place when we called ahead but to be honest it's not. It's great for a girls night out or a date.",2014-05-14 06:50:18

Their burritos are the best & are filled chock full of good stuff. I especially like the chicken burrito with black beans, pico, guacamole, & sour cream. It really is a large burrito & will fill you up by itself. The taste of the burrito is just so much better here than any of the other chains.

As for this location, they have outdoor seating, which I'm a huge fan of. It can get pretty packed during your lunch hours, but the line moves pretty quickly & your wait shouldn't be too long.

While Qdoba may not serve tortilla chips with their burritos or have a salsa bar, they still win in the taste department amongst the chain Tex Mex joints.

The Lamb Stew (Georgian style) was very tasty but I would suggest for them to render the fat first off the lamb before they put it in the crock pot.  There was a bit of fat on each piece and some a bit too much fat.  Overall though it was a good dish.

The Chicken shish kabobs were tasty...They are thighs and I prefer white meat.  But, still, tasted good.  The roasted potatoes with it were really nicely seasoned.

It is located in the Concordia tunnel close to the guy metro. This place is always busy with Concordia students grabbing food to go and walking by you'll normally see a line up of people waiting to order. Don't worry though, the line goes quickly and your food is ready in no time.

This place serves big slices of thin crust pizza ($2.25), poutine ($3.50), and shish taouk ($7). (Prices include tax). 

It took me a long time of always walking by before I decided to actually try it. There are very few places to sit, the ventilation is bad, the lighting is dingy; you don't come here for the ambiance. I'm glad I did though, when I'm in the mood for a cheap/quick/fatty/yummy meal between classes this is where I go. 

The pizza is decent, the shish taouk plate is pretty good - they give you lots of chicken and the garlic sauce is not so garlicky yet still addictive, and the poutine is seriously REALLY GOOD. They put tons of curds and gravy in their poutine, just the way I like it :).

We'd just finished watching the most recent episode of Girls, so Hux was really overwrought with placid angst and sexual energy. ""Oh, come on,"" she said. ""Don't be a downer. I wanna go out and make it a night."" She said the word 'night' in that heavily inflected way of hers that lets me know with a drop of her eyes and the angle of her chin that this 'night' could involve anything. 
I envisioned my girl all tweaked and wild and sweaty, possibly in some condition of undress, and most likely getting me at some point punched in the nose. ""Okay, I'm in.""
We sashayed into Heist like c-list movie stars. When Hux fires up, she really comes out: ankle-boot wedge heels, tight black leggings climbing shear up her fecund thighs, some oversized top strewn sloppily about her soft long torso, and all that hair there playin' round her shoulders like the gods in the box of the heathers in the vale. 
Heist is a brew-hall, for sure. It's a brew-ha-ha. It's a gorgeous dungeon of a bar, replete with heavy wood that anchors all around you and seals you in, lavish lights and golden ornamentation, harsh acoustics lapping the same dull roar back and back on you like succeeding waves. In an instant, I sank into it. In an instant, I needed a beer. ""This is me,"" I said to Hux, eyes alight with glitter and glean. ""How did I not know?"" She rubbed one tiny hand into my shoulder and led me forward through the room. 
We ended up spending most of the evening at the downstairs bar. We elbowed and angled our way up to the black marble, visions aglance to all the beautiful people wilting and undulating all about, forearms crossed, eyes squinting to note the options on the little white drink placard before us. There were no clever names or silly mix-breeds here. This was beer, labeled as it is, stripped down, honest, and pure. ""I'll have the IPA,"" I heard myself say seven or eight times in a row. 
Some blond bird, a real horrorshow display of pixie sexiness at its most unbreakable, was shoving her face full of chicken wings at the opposite corner of the bar. As I watched her unabashedly suckle honey glaze from each twiggy fingertip, a comely waitress sauntered by, wooden slats of flatbread pizzas in each hand, and the aroma drifted hot behind her in a trail like savory smoke. I slung back my first drink fast and deep, then gestured in the blond pixie's direction with my chin. Hux glanced her way, narrowed her eyes, processed, and then her face softened into a lurid glare. ""God, I love this place,"" I said to her. ""Get me drunk,"" she replied. 
Our man, our bartender man, was a handsome grizzly of a bloke, bald head, exquisitely manicured beard, dark and throaty, barrel-chested like a viking king. Women approached him like giddy schoolgirls. He had this way of shaking their hands, where he'd clasp each of theirs in one of his and bow and shiver in a little curtsy, and dear god those girls just ate it all up. Hell, so did I. 
This ravishing songstress scampered by, raven-haired and goddess tall and all lean up and down and beneath and below the shimmering strands of her flapper gown. She met another girl, almost equal in design, and they alit in a white-hot embrace. They turned to me. ""Can you take our picture?"" they asked. 
""I'll take all your pictures."" 
They kissed cheeks and kicked knees high and tilted their heads and flung their curls and I captured it all, each gesture, each wildly waving hand, down forever in a digital frame. ""Are you lovers?"" I asked. 
""No, we just met.""
I felt Hux grab my cheeks, hard and tight, her thumb and forefinger crushing my mouth in against my lower teeth. She twisted my face to meet her own. ""What are you doing?"" she said. 
""Making new friends."" 
The two girls laughed and flashed out their neon bomb smiles and they grabbed Hux and hugged her and complimented her hair. ""What are you drinking?"" she asked them. ""Anything,"" they replied.
Hux turned to me, lips apout, cheeks high and fiery. ""Buy them drinks,"" she commanded. 
After a few Oatmeal Stouts and Red Ales and way too many perfectly-formed novelty martinis, we and our two new friends were all exactly where we needed to be. Heist is a place to get drunk. It's a place that makes you get drunk; it forces you to. It pulls it over on you. I grabbed Hux deep around the waist, snatched her in, foul breath expelling hot between our faces. ""I get it,"" I said to her in a leer, ""Heist... it steals us."" Hux rolled into my shoulder and purred furious at my chest. ""You're silly,"" she mumbled into my sweater. 
I stood there, my girl in my arms, drunk in my veins, blood in my heart, and all this noise and racket of lust and love pounding full and through me. I looked up to see the beautiful barrel of a bartender watching us and grinning. I nodded to him. ""What's your name, man?"" I asked.
""I'm Stefan.""
""Stefan,"" I said. ""Thank you, sir. I have a feeling we'll be seeing you again soon.""",2013-02-12 08:04:41

Another new Izakaya in town! Seeing other fellow Yelpers check in, it was only a matter of time until we had the chance to experience Cocokala for ourselves.Very wide selection from skewers to grilled items, entrees, daily specials and everything in between. The alcohol selections here are pretty extensive too. I went with an Interesting sounding Oyster Stout which had a similar taste to Guinness Stout which I enjoyed.

For the food, the complimentary cold Edamame was good, and we also tried the Karaage, Beef Tongue(plate), Miso Black Cod and three of their spoons-Avocado, 
Uni-Nori, and Salmon-Ikura. While the Karaage was tasty, all the others were forgettable. The spoons were basically knockoff nigiri on a spoon, no one can touch Ichiza's Kushi-Tan, period...I've had better black cod at Goyemon, Sen of Japan, Ichiza, Soho, and even the Marketplace Cafe at the Cal!!! Shishito was nothing special, and the Yuzu Soda is nothing like Cafe De Japon (RIP) used to serve.

With the wide selections, and prices a bit higher, quality has to improve greatly to compete with my two favorite spots in nearby Chinatown....ALOHA!!!

We had been once before a few years back, though I am not sure if it was before or after the Diners, Drive ins and Dives episode. We used to go to Joe's BBQ a lot and found out about Joe's Farm Grill through them. The first time we came in here I wasn't that impressed. I had gotten a burger (before I went vegetarian) and it was dry, bland, and boring. Nobody else remembers what they got that time either. So I decided we should give this place a second chance. 

We showed up for dinner around 6:45 and there was already a line out the door and halfway to the street. I had read about the lines online before we came in here but didn't expect how long it was or how slow it moved. We didn't move for the first ten minutes we stood there, and then it took another thirty minutes to get through the rest of the line. I am a patient person, so I don't mind lines, but this one was a little ridiculous. There are only two cash registers, and once we had gotten far enough up the line to see them, one of them closed and left only one open. Seriously? There is a line out the door and they close a register? Why couldn't they get someone else to take over? Either way, we finally got up to the register and ordered our food. I got the portabello burger with garlic fries and a side of beet salad, my husband got the fontina burger with onion rings, mom got the ahi tuna burger with regular fries, and my niece ended up with grilled cheese and fries. We all got fountain drinks as well. All for a total of $52. A little on the expensive side for three adults and one child. The descriptions for the burgers tell you you get a choice of your favorite side, but of course what they don't tell you is they up-charge you if you get anything other than the regular fries. Which I didn't find out until after we had paid already. Very misleading. 

While the line moved as slow as molasses, at least the food didn't take that long after being ordered. We waited less than 10 minutes to get our food. The only annoying thing about this was for some reason my nieces sandwich wasn't ready and we had to wait another five minutes for it to be done. I can make a grilled cheese at home in less time than that, and why it wasn't ready with the rest of the food makes no sense. Unless they gave away her sandwich to someone else or something. Eventually we all get our food and start to eat. My portabello burger was huge. The mushroom was at least twice the size of the bun, and it had lettuce and a green goddess dressing. I added the pickles that came on the side as well. It was a little on the salty side, but it was pretty tasty. My garlic fries were delicious. They weren't too spicy but there was an enormous amount of garlic. I love it! I smelled like garlic for two days afterwards. The beet salad however left a lot to be desired. The beets themselves were under seasoned and there wasn't nearly enough blue cheese. I could have also done without the pecans. They seemed out of place. My husband really liked his burger and his onion rings were really crispy and well seasoned. My mom said her ahi burger was also really good, however because of the way it was sliced, it kept falling out of the bun. Not the easiest sandwich to eat. My nieces grilled cheese was standard grilled cheese. 

All of us really enjoyed our meal once we finally got to eat it. However the amount of time spent waiting in line made the experience a little less enjoyable. But my husband and I will probably come back here eventually, I just think we will have to plan the time better so we don't have to wait so long.",2011-10-12 18:16:31

Booked on Open Table and actually arrived 30 mins early. They were able to accommodate us right away. It was VERY busy on their patio and moderately busy in the dining room. Definitely filled up as the night went on. It was a tiny bit loud in the dining room, but was kind of expected. 

The gentleman we had for a server (tall, dark guy and dont see his name on the receipt) was very good, and quick to refill water and wine.
Ordered a great Viognier from the wine list, and it was ice cold.
We had the Goat Cheese Spinach Dip thing, and it was great! A bit spicy, which was a great surprise.

Friends at the table had the Calamari dinner, which she said was outstanding. She is from BC too, so pretty used to seafood and really enjoyed! Other friend had the Egg Carbonara fettuccine, which she also loved. She is Italian, and knows a thing or two about pasta! haha ;)

I had the New York Strip with bacon marmalade, and it was soooo good. The bacon jam was a great mix with the beef, which was cooked perfectly. It was a great hunk of meat, on top a hefty pillow of mashed potatoes and veggies. The mashed potatoes were soooo creamy. Very tasty indeed!

I am not a dessert person at all, but the apple and blueberry crumble called my name...and i responded by EATING IT ALLLLLL.

We went to Vegas on a busy weekend so Day Club cabanas were going for high minimums.  We stayed at SLS so we walked by and saw many guys trying to get people to come out.  We asked what the minimum for 6-7 guys in a cabana...Initially he quoted $1200 (which was on par with other places).  We got his number and texted him later asking for $750.  He said ""ok"".  We headed down on Saturday at around 12:30.  Not really a long line to get in.  We were shown to a nice cabana next to the stage.  The cabana had a L shaped couch, Fridge, TV, Fan (w/mister), and two large day beds. Our waitress was really friendly and quick.  $750 was a good minimum.  We had plenty to eat and drink and met the minimum without too much trouble.  Any higher and we would've probably had to get a bottle.  There are two pools.  Water was pretty cool and didn't seem heated at all.  I would say it was at about 75% capacity that day.  Not overly crowded but most of the cabanas were taken.  There are 3 blackjack tables in the back.  Restrooms were clean.  Rehab was spinning and music was pretty much all EDM.  I thought the day club at hardrock was way crazier and 10x bigger.  I don't need all of that.  This was good enough to hang out and chill.  No need to go crazy spending $$$

I would only go back if I was staying at the SLS and wanted a place to hang.",2015-05-21 02:25:32

Like most other girls my age, I have been lusting for a pair of Manolos since Carrie Bradshaw made them popular on Sex and the City. While you can buy Manolo Blahnik shoes at Neiman Marcus, Saks, and a few other stores, there are only two MB stores in the country - one in New York City and the one at the Wynn.

The store is not hard to find - if you get dropped off by a cab at the Wynn, walk toward the Esplanade and make a left when you get to Chanel. The store will be a few down on the left. Hamid was the sales associate working the morning I was there and he was excellent. Exactly what I want in a sales associate - greets me when I enter, lets me walk around the store slowly while deciding which pair of shoes to try on, and then is extremely helpful once I make that all important decision. He really took the time to make sure that the shoes I was going to buy fit properly which I really appreciated.

Back when I was single I actually owned and decorated my apartment with nick-nacks of lighthouses. I am married now, with kids, and yes a resident of Las Vegas. Lighthouses, actual and my have become extinct.

Here Cabo Wabo, the food was good. For an appetizer we ordered some good old fashioned chips and salsa, which were fine, although a few of our chips were stale. I ate fajitas (steak and chicken combo) and they were fine. The tortillas, three of them, were served wrapped in paper. two of the three tortillas needed to be peeled apart. I don't know, that just didn't seem right to me. My wife ordered a burrito and says it tasted fine. 

She also ordered a side of guacamole which cost $9.00. I ordered some french fries which cost $5.00. Seems to me these two side orders should have cost the same. I don't know, maybe that's just me. 

Seating, I don't know, I like having some elbowroom myself. But it's non-existant here. Tables are very close together. I noticed severs having to ""squeeze it in"" more than once while walking between tables. If there were an emergency situation. Or something loud like a car backfiring near-by, this crowded patio could become a problem.

When we arrived at Cabo Wabo we were inside The Miracle Mile shops. So we stopped at the host stand inside. We were told to go outside to the outside host stand. Now, I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if I were the host I would have said something to the effect of ""We have a host stand just outside as well, follow me, let me take you there."" I don't know just sounds a little more professional to me.

As the wife and I were departing, we passed by the Lighthouse to go inside and return to the Miracle Mile Shops. My wife mentioned that the inside of the place was quite empty (it was about 1:00pm) and was surprised the hostess didn't just seat us or walk us through like earlier mentioned. I don't know. I really want to like Cabo Wabo. My wife really enjoyed the experience. I'll wait to read her review and maybe rethink the whole persoal experience.",2015-03-13 00:25:25

I came on a lazy Saturday afternoon with a friend. I really liked the layout of the restaurant. It's pretty open with a good sized patio. The restaurant was pretty empty on my visit, but it was also a Saturday in July and 112 degrees outside... not exactly the time of day most people in Phoenix are out and about.

We were quickly greeted, sat, and had our drink orders taken. I order a glass of sangria and it was the perfect light and refreshing drink for a hot summer day. And since it was happy hour, it was only $5.

To start, we split the Otro salad which has a little bit of everything, including eggs and corn nuts. I was a little wary, but since the waiter recommended it, we went with it. Excellent choice! The salad was light and flavorful, but also filing. The corn nuts added the perfect crunch and saltiness. We also ordered some guacamole to share. The guacamole was delicious and tasted really fresh. I'm pretty sure they make it to order because we asked for some changes and they were able to accommodate.

Being a big fan of Gallo Blanco, I had to try the tacos. I'm happy to report their just as good as Gallo's! And like Gallo Blano, they are also on happy hour daily from 2-6 pm. The other entrees, as well as brunch, also sounded great. The menu definitely has a lot more variety than Gallo.

Attached to a full service car wash/gas station and a convenience store this place is always hopping with folks getting food to go. I have tried this location about a dozen times in the 10 years we lived in Vegas and it was always just decent, every other time. Remember I said decent not good. 

The food is always prepared overly salty, never the same portion any time you order it and every fourth time they give you the wrong to go order. Note that I don't order anything fancy here as nothing is fancy, I just order one of the beef taco combo plates.

There is no consistency with the food proportions and the way it's cooked. Sometimes the tacos are out of this world and served hot and sometimes the food is cold by the time I drive 5 minutes down the road and the beans taste old and they've salted my beef taco to death. In the second scenario I just end up throwing it in the trash after two bites.

Perhaps the secret to this place is to either be so drunk you don't notice how bad the food is or to take your to go order and sit down in one of the dirty, never bussed, communal round tables so you can scarf it down as your car gets washed or your gas gets pumped, that way the taste of the overly salty food just passes quickly through your taste buds. One more thing, this place employs the grumpiest, most un-friendly counter staff. Try smiling at them when you're paying and tipping 20% and all you get is a grumpy look or a scowl. Advice lighten up guys you're supposed to want customers to return.

I had green beans which were good and Greens which were not very flavorful, but still had a little texture so at least not overcooked.  I wanted to try everyting, so took most of it home and it reheated into a couple more meals, which was great.

I had a combo of the Mango and Tropical sorbets -- while the mango tasted just like a real fresh mango, the Tropical was just out of this world. Fresh, densely creamy, but light at the same time.

But - this hotel has definitely seen better days. They have revamped the rooms so they are ""updated"" but as many casino/hotels in Vegas has definitely had its years of use and abuse.

To start the regular rooms - they are big and functional, no-frills rooms. Definitely a place to crash. The Go rooms are better - but painted white so you can see the use in these rooms very easily. A little more nifty with the tvs in the bathroom mirror versus the regular rooms. 

The elevator situation stinks no matter where you are. You wait and wait for an elevator.

This hotel is heavily trafficked - and you will hear people all night (especially if you are facing the strip - you will hear the Omnia across the street, the people running up and down the hallways, etc.) 

The High Roller side/LINQ is the safest side to stay on in terms of noise, but you will pay more. (Habitat elevators)

However - I do like the Flamingo for its convenience on the strip and the pool is great. They have a huge pool with a grotto, slide, dj, etc. And the bonus is there is a kids pool - so the adults can have their own.

I love music, but I'm not a talented musician or or an expert on orchestras. I'm kind of stuck with rating the TSO based on my personal emotional reaction to them and to the recent seasons.

Honestly? I love them. I've been taking advantage of the $14-30 tsoundcheck tickets while I still can so I've seen a lot of these guys. They've become familiar faces and I've become kind of attached to them. I've actually gotten really fond of Peter Oundjian, the music director too. I love it when he bounces onto the stage full of enthusiasm and tells us about the pieces they're going to play. He's also put together an amazing season this year. It's been a struggle to stop myself from going to everything. They've  brought in wonderful guest conductors: people like Steven Reineke, Bramwell Tovey, Giancarlo Guerrero and Andrew Grams who I've. Rob Kapilow is also doing a series of ""What Makes it Great?"" concerts which are absolutely worth attending if you want to learn more about certain pieces.

If you're 35 and under, tsoundcheck is ridiculously good value for the quality of the performances. Even at full prices, you can get a ticket for $29 if you're willing to tolerate the balcony sides. And considering they get guests like Joshua Bell, Itzhak Perlman, Emanuel Ax, Yo Yo Ma and Yuja Wang; it's worth it.

Booking through the website is generally easy. If there's a problem, the box office are easily contactable via phone and email. They're all incredibly pleasant. Particular shout-out to Alex Perala who has patiently answered all my tsoundcheck questions and made sure I got to all the concerts I wanted to see.

All of the appetizers are delicious. Favorites include the Ahi Tuna, crabcake, and stuffed mushrooms. But you're going there for the steak, right? Right. 

The last time I went, they had a special where two people could have filets and split a lobster. We elected for this option. I ordered my steak medium. It came out sizzling in butter. After overcoming my caveman urges to tuck in to the obviously too-hot-to-eat-yet steak, I instead ate some of the asparagus we ordered as an appetizer. 

Important note. At Ruth's Chris, almost all sides are family sized so you can share. Our asparagus was perfectly cooked and was accompanied by a delicious hollandaise.

fR6FUaSsBSKN1wl3mKxaHw,e8uzNcSC5tQMD22GNAQEQA,X2f2s37_cFKo4xpzGFqk1w,3,3,2,1,"SETTING:
Clean and open space. Multiple tables to seat small or big parties. Quite expansive buffet that ran along the back wall of the restaurant.

FOOD:
Was in the area for lunch and had an Asian food hankering. All I knew was 1) Me hangry, and, 2) Want something Asian, but didn't have a specific asian cuisine in mind. After zero thought process, I decided to go for the shotgun approach. Asian lunch buffet, I'm coming for ya.

There was a little bit of everything at Hokkaido. It's not a Japanese buffet as the name may seem to suggest. It was a pan-Asian buffet that served sushi, seafood, dim sum, noodles, meat, dessert. We all know that a buffet is usually quantity over quality. So no particular knock on Hokkaido, but I got what I expected: a sampling of your typical Westernized Asian fare. Don't expect anything fancy or traditional, this is a buffet...you get the Westernized ""favorites"" (ie: california roll, general tso's, chow mein, etc). Oh, and if you need some good 'ol traditional American delicacies to add to the mix, you can pick up some pizza, soup, and salad.

For buffet standards, the sushi was decent (I was scared to try the raw fish because I wasn't sure how fresh it was...that's just me). Seafood was fine (mussels, squid, etc). Not the freshest, but tasty enough. Chinese food was what you would expect from a fast food Chinese joint. It was one of those days where I just wanted to stuff my face with all kinds of asian food and wasn't so picky, so I was satisfied--minus the grease stain I left on my shirt.  

SERVICE:
Minimal but attentive, which is what I would expect at a buffet because you help yourself. They take away your old plates and refill your drinks quickly.  

IMPRESSIONS:
I left Hokkaido with one hand over my stomach from over-eating (3 plates in 30 minutes! Ugh!), and another hand holding a slightly stale creampuff. I probably muttered something the lines of ""never again,"" but that's too bold of a statement to be of any value. But $10 for a lunch buffet...now that's value, even if it is Westernized Asian food.",2015-02-19 02:08:19

Everything else was 'ok.' I'm a huge lover of crab rangoon and Golden Harbor's just weren't hitting the spot. The steamed rice was also too dry for my taste.

This place also makes really good chebureks and salads. They have someone in the patio making meat skewers out on the grill just like they do in Georgia. So basically when you drive up, you already get an amazing aroma!

I hate to be ""that guy"" who gives Campagnolo its first [gasp] 2-star rating, but I was disappointed. I also don't think I've ever read so many negative reviews for a place and still see 3-stars and above being dished out left, right and centre. For me, it's not that Campagnolo is bad by any means, but it's just that it falls into the ""meh, I've experienced better"" category.

Between my dining mates and myself, we've felt that the dishes were generally bland and underwhelming. I wish I could be more descriptive, but it's been about a year since I last attended and can only remember the impressions formed by me and my dining mates.  

The serving sizes also tended to be small and unfilling, even when paired with appetizers. Our server was appropriate but service was slooow. And finally, the decor seemed rather inconsistent (i.e., the bar and kitchen area seem really well done, but old traces of the Coffee Time still permeated with their linoleum flooring).

Their restaurant space is small but they made it work with marble tables and Chinese style chairs... The walkway area was really tight though. Tea was offered and there were several type of sauces to fit your taste - vinegar, soya sauce and even chili oil!

This was another version of a pancake, with leeks and green onion inside. It was pretty good and chewy. Unfortunately, the leek taste was really strong for me, so I only ate one. I saw a lot of tables ordering this dish though! So I bet it must be really popular.

These pan fried pork dumplings were a must! It tasted so good and fresh off the grill too! The last time I had really good pan fried pork dumplings was in Chinatown a few years ago. Drizzle a bit of soya sauce on this baby and you're good to chow down!

We also got the steamed dumplings or known as 小籠包 xiao long bao in Chinese. There were many types of steamed dumplings here - different types of meat and vegetables combined.

All the steamed dumplings/小籠包 comes in orders of 15 in one of these big Chinese steamers... so be careful when ordering or you could take the food back home and eat some more when you're hungry~
The trick with 小籠包 is to eat it all in one bite but because it was steaming hot, it was almost impossible to do so.

Every 小籠包 comes with a bit of soup inside the dumpling, which is why it's best to eat it in one bite. But with the dumplings being hot, I like to split the top part of the dumpling so the heat gets out and it'll cool off.

We ordered two different types of 小籠包.
One is Pork with Mushrooms, another was either Pork or Chicken with Leek. Leek is pretty popular when it comes to dumplings... not sure why that's the case, perhaps the fragrance of the leek brings the harmony of the dumplings together.

The 小籠包 wasn't anything spectacular but it was decent enough. I really enjoyed the pan-fried dumplings more! But the problem with every pan-fried dumpling is that you can taste the oil/grease(?) when eating them... tastes almost sinful, but it's worth it every time.

I would also recommend not coming during the dinner time on a weekend because we came here on a weekend for dinner and was lucky enough to get a big table (there weren't many).

Le complexe offre aussi l'avantage d'être directement relié Palais des congrès, à la Place des Arts, au Musée d'Art Contemporain de Montréal par une galerie de boutiques d'art de très grande qualité.  Enfin, vous pourrez facilement vous garer dans son parking intérieur, à condition d'être d'accord pour en payer le tarif exorbitant!
En bref, le complexe est en endroit sympathique pour ses évènements mais peu pratique pour y magasiner, à moins de n'être pas regardant sur la dépense et de savoir d'avance ce que l'on vient y chercher.",2010-12-08 23:44:53

I was pleasantly surprised by the food and drink here considering the type of neighbourhood it's in. The crowd was still a very King west type, but the laid back environment helped to dissipate any residual pretentiousness carried in from the office. 

Ordering is easy, you go up to the counter and make your choices (sausage, toppings, sides + sauces, drinks) and take a number to put on your table so someone can bring your order over. The food was great! I had the wild boar, and my dinner mate had a classic Italian. My sausage was super tasty, but the Italian was pretty typical. I had a taste of his, and he of mine, and we both agreed that the wild boar was the winner. The Italian met the mark, but we were a little disappointed because we expected a really exceptional sausage. But an Italian sausage is an Italian sausage. We also shared an order of duck fat fries, which were a little soft and soggy (which is how I like them!) but didn't wow either of us. The dipping sauce was good (forget which one we had) and there were plenty of fun choices to suit your whim. Plenty of beers on tap for all sorts of beer drinkers, including the giant oversized glass which took the 2 of us to finish. We wondered why his beer cost more than his food!

The only disadvantage of this place is the hassle of finding a parking spot as well as leaving the garage. Even if you leave an hour early to get to the concert/event you'll still get caught up in the mess.  So once your frustration level is on the rise, the annoyance of walking from the garage/valet should peak your annoyance level.

Before you could carry bottled water into the venue, now they make you pour it into a plastic cup (which a pain because guranteed you'll spill it one way or another). Refreshments: you might as well eat supper/dinner before you attend the concert. Its not worth the money to buy snacks at the venue.

If you want to purchase merchandise, you might as well give them your first born. It is sooo expensive. A shirt for 40 dollars? I remember when shirts were only 20!?

Seating: honestly concerts are better in the round cause everyone gets their money worth.  Floor seats arent worth it unless if youre in the first 3 rows. Dont buy the upper/nosebleed section seats cause the sound quality is bad as well as your view. By some unlucky chance you are in those nosebleed section, you can always rent (yes, I said rent) binoculars for 10.

As I was waiting, the window staff member asked me to move to the next window. I told him no, I was waiting for the manager and I would not move till I got my order. He rolled his eyes. He was a stocky rude boy.

mimosa -- the cake was dense, which is good for the amount of frosting Gigi's puts on their cakes. the frosting was a champagne/orange flavor without being strong. it was a lovely ""light"" cupcake that would be precious for a wedding shower.

salted caramel -- this is the one we thought we'd love the most but it came in third in our unofficial sampling. the cake, dubbed ""dark chocolate"" didn't have much chocolate flavor. there was salted caramel in the cupcake, but most had soaked in, just leaving the crunchy bits of salt, which somewhat interfered with the softness of the cupcake. perhaps dissolving the salt in the warm caramel and then putting it in the cake?  the caramel frosting with ganache and sea salt was very good. would prefer a better ratio of ganache to caramel frosting, but since there is SO much frosting on these cakes (i typically left half of my frosting on plate, while dining buddy ate all hers ...to each their own), it would be hard to have that much ganache.

coming in second was the lemon. straightforward, clean, well-balanced lemon flavor, both in the sponge cake and in the frosting. lemon curd in the cupcake did not absorb into cake, making for a nice surprise in the middle. enjoyed the yellow sugar sprinkles and candied lemon on top. would definitely order this one again.

the winner?  drumroll, please (and should be no surprise by readers of our yelp review and our food blog)

the maple bacon cupcake.
wow.  imagine a cupcake that tastes just like a really good buttermilk pancake, with nice crunchy bits of bacon scattered throughout. not one or two flecks, but a lot. and not flabby pieces, but nice, crispy, bacony bacon. then, put on top a wonderful buttercream frosting that is full of real maple flavor....not too sweet, just really maple-y....like good quality Vermont syrup. then its topped with a bit more of those crunchy, tasty bacon bits. hands down winner. interestingly, this cupcake is not featured in their brochure so hopefully it will become a regular.

we're already planning our flavors for our next visit -- we think we're going to channel our inner southern belles and go for the Kentucky Bourbon (yeah, no surprise there), the sweet potato pie, the Southern Comfort, and the Texas Milk Chocolate.

The entertainers seemed totally thrown off (understandably) by how low the ceiling is in here. I felt like it was really distracting to them throughout the night.

Another distraction stems from the fact that the tables in the reserved seating area are packed so tightly together that the wait staff can barely meander through. I spent half of the night watching them struggle to squeeze in front of and behind the tables. 

Biggest drawback? NO LOCAL BEER. Are you kidding me? I legitimately thought our waiter was joking when he started listing off Bud Light and Coors.

I found the cardio machines to be in excellent shape and I enjoyed watching Law & Order, SVU while sweating on the elliptical (go ahead, make fun of the fact that I like ellipticals).

The best part of the YMCA is how clean it is. There is cleaning spray and a towel stationed at every machine and I noticed that people were very good about cleaning up after themselves.",2016-06-28 16:10:15

On the day we went, BLT Steak was offering a number of specials. I selected the Santa Barbara Mussels for an appetizer from the special menu and they were excellent-nice and plump.  They were in an ale sauce that was tasty and the bread they served with it was fantastic.  Great char.

Speaking of bread, they serve complementary Gruyere popovers which were pretty good as well.  One of the other people I was with had the crabcakes and she said they were tasty although a bit spicy.

Of all the entrees, surprisingly the Branzino Sea Bass was the best and the ribeye was very good.

I ordered the Tiger Shrimp with Thai Basil and Braised Endive.  These shrimp were huge but they needed a different sauce.  I believe the endive may have given the shrimp a slightly bitter taste.

For the sides, we stuck with the potato gratin which I enjoyed.  

I was so stuffed at the end I could not eat desert but they brought out expresso cookies which hit the spot.

I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a steakhouse but you don't want to pay outrageous prices.  I liked the menu of this place as well-it is pretty traditional but has a number of other items you may not see at your standard steakhouse.

Also, if you love mussels, I recommend going here before they run out of the Santa Barbara Mussels and take it off the menu.",2015-03-27 08:30:54

My boyfriend and I are vegan so normally we tend to avoid Korean chain restaurants because of the lack of vegan options in the ones we've gone to in the past (before going vegan). However, my boyfriend decided it wouldn't hurt to ask an employee at The Owl of Minerva and she assured us that they DID have a few vegan options which is the reason we tried it out, in the first place. 

The first thing that felt off was that for some reason, the employees were not very happy that we wanted to wait 10 minutes for our other two friends to arrive before we ordered. We went in around 8:30pm and they said they closed at 11:00pm so I don't understand why they felt the need to rush us to order.

The worst part of the whole experience was that the few vegan options the employee showed us from the menu when we first asked, suddenly could no longer be made vegan for whatever reason. In the beginning, she specifically said that we could substitute any beef with tofu but suddenly everyone was saying that we could not. What a disgusting scheme of luring us in! The only thing that we could order was the tofu vegetable soup which turned out to be small and watery.

Other things that just sealed the deal of us never returning was that the employees never ended up giving our two friends tea or water, nor did they bother offering to refill any cups. They were also extremely pushy about us paying the bill, as if they thought we were just going to simply walk out of there without paying. We were not a rowdy group and we certainly did not look like those type of people.

Hands down, best steak in town!

Okay, so it is high time I finally review this place. I go here with my sister maybe... once every two months? Sometimes more frequently. We love it here. Originally, I was referred to this place by a very cheery funny and friendly Walmart Cashier on a shopping trip where my mother, for no real reason, had gotten noticeably stressed out. She suggested the place for a drink to calm her down - I didn't point out that we don't drink, but I filed the name away in my mind for future reference. It was possibly two years after that that I actually went here, and immediately loved it.

Alright, so lets start with some slight flaws. Every place has them, and RWB is no exception. Mainly, the place is so popular, parking can be difficult at times, and the waiting area is lacking. So, if you go here on a busy night, you might be standing outside for a bit - BUT even with this, the food is worth it. 

Every time I come here, the staff is wonderful and the food is amazing... but, I confess... I usually get the same thing every time. Medium marinated 10 oz. flat Iron steak with potatoes and a salad. 

Best. Thing. Ever. 

My first few times here, I tried a few other things, but after giving the steak a try... I can't pass it up. And, let me say, I hate steak. I never eat it anywhere else because I hate chewing on boot-leather, and have never been pleased with it. Here, though, it is amazing - and the price can't be beat! Some other things on the menu are pricey, but the 10 oz. flat iron is an amazing deal for a fantastic steak. If you haven't tried it, you need to. I love it that the kitchen is viewable from the main dining room, which not only makes you feel a bit more secure about who's handling your food, but you can also see the head Chef working and maintaining his line of cooks - such a professional kitchen! 

And, of course, if your food is ever not how you ordered it, they take it back and fix it for you, no questions or fuss. Once, my sister's medium steak was clearly well done, no pink at all to it. When we pointed that out, the server took the steak back, we had another out very quickly, and were given an apology for the hassle. The service here is always a delight. 

So, yes, once again best steak in town! Go try it. Now.

*UPDATE: Sadly, they no longer have the 10 oz marinated flat iron steak - after awhile, it was downgraded to an 8 oz marinated flat iron steak, but now it is gone all together. They still have steaks, but frankly, they're only okay at best. Unless its marinated decently, the average steak is like fancy boot-leather. So, the place still has some nice things, but I have to drop my 5 star review to a 3 star review. For me, personally, the rest of the menu is just a little too pricey for decent food, and the establishment a little too crowded.",2014-12-26 21:32:50

If it were up to me to name these places, I doubt I could come with something witty and charming.

Claim Jumper for example.

Claim Jumping was a particularly heinous crime back when I was young and the earth was still cooling...punishable by some particularly unhappy ways to ""meet ones maker"" as meted out by the rough frontier justice of the time.

That's possibly the origin of the name ""Claim Jumper"" for this place...eating here could certainly contribute to your premature demise...we saw a number of people that are clearly Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door...at 4,000 calories per serving:)

I would call this place ""Jumbo Food"" or ""Mega Portions"" or ""Godzilla Grazing"" or something like that...but it's not up to me:)

Claim Jumper is mostly about quantity...not to say there food isn't OK...it is...just OK...especially if you are in the moo'd (get the bovine reference:) for something that will satiate your hunger until sometime next month:)

The Beautiful Carin and I have been  here a few times over the years and it's great for when you haven't had a chance to get to the grocery store...a meal here will provide leftovers to feed you for the remainder of the week...just add a glass of water:)

We went back to Claim Jumper the other evening, to meet a friend and have a little dinner (a euphemism if ever there were one:)

On this visit, Carin had a 55 gallon drum of Chopped Cobb Salad and I had the  1/2 order of Chicken Fried Steak (I know they call it ""Country Fried Steak"" but it's not steak any more than it's chicken so...)

The  1/2 order was only 15 lb's of thickly crusted cube steak, mashed potatoes and gravy (gravy on everything is always a plus BTW:)

How on earth can anyone but the 1,000 pound man eat the full order of this?!?! 

I am honestly not complaining about the size of the portions (well, not in any real way), but how did ""double"" become the serving size of choice?...Just curious:)

We took home more than  1/2 of our dinners and DeeDee was thoroughly delighted with us..esp. the Chicken Fried Steak...she's not much of a salad eater:)

You know what, there are certainly worse chain and non-chain restaurants around and even though I am giving them crap about serving sizes, Claim Jumper staff are always nice to us and the service has always been above average:)

So I say, let's not hate them because you need a shovel to get around on that platter they call a ""dinner plate""...go see them when you're headed out for survival training for a few weeks and you're going to need a few thousand extra calories to stay alive:)",2009-06-26 22:25:07

Lately, I haven't been to many big chain restaurants as I love trying new things. My wife wanted to go as it's kind of hard to track down decent sea food in Charlotte and surrounding. Red Lobster normally always comes through for me and luckily enough, I've never had one issue at the many locations I've been to.

We where going to the movies at the mall and decided to go eat early. The wait was only 15 minutes. I was shocked about this. The staff was great, the waiter was very good. 

The food. We wanted to shake things up a bit and not do what we normally do here. To start, of course we had our fill of the biscuits. We then ordered the lobster pizza appetizer. After that we ordered a few items from the new small bites menu. We got the dumplings and the lobster roll. The dumplings had a spicy sauce on it, which my wife thought was too hot, but I loved it. The lobster roll was amazing in flavor, but I was kind of disappointed that it was more of a ice of toast that was folded over and not a roll at all. They also left the salad off of it. After that we ordered some of the lobster tacos. They were okay, but the sauce was so overpowering that we could not taste the lobster at all. And the tacos were only about half way filled.

No reservations so for a table for 3 we walked in around 6pm on a Wednesday and had to wait about 30 minutes. The interior also has a beautiful retro vintage vibe to it. The music is quite loud though, and since its a small space the table behind us was extremely loud and made it hard for our own group to chat. They also seem to run out of items pretty early, we wanted to try the uni toast but was told there was none left. 

Complimentary bread was a good start. The crispy squash was great, really crispy with lots of nuts and creamy sauce. It gets pretty heavy after a while. The iceberg salad fresh, lots of tangy dressing and again lots of toppings including puffed wild rice and its covered in cheese which makes it delicious. The spicy tuna toasted was good but nothing outstanding. 

The foie gras was amazing! Really rich and buttery with sweet and tart cherries. The bread it came with was also soft and toasted. This was luxurious, for the serving size it was also a great value. Lastly we got the short rib, it was perfectly cooked and the meat fell off the bone. Really savory. 

We left extremely full so for 3 people you could order less than what we did. The service was really nice and friendly. The price was reasonable for the amount of quality of food as well. Would definitely come back again!",2018-07-11 15:11:04

I had the Texan burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium and it did come out well done. It was dry and I did have to order extra Bbq sauce to compensate. I'm thinking maybe it needed lettuce, tomato and mayo to add to it. I'm just not sure, it was a little too basic. I still ate all of it. The sweet potato fries were scrumptious! My mother ordered the salmon plate, the salmon did look a little dry. She claimed the rice and veggies were flavorless but she is a hard cookie to please. The happy hour menu did look intriguing and look forward to coming back to try some of those adult beverages. The manager did come by to ask us how our meal was but I didn't permit my mother to say anything because both of us ate our entire meal and we were time constricted. It would have looked like we were complaining to just complain. I'm sure she would have listened and done something to compensate.

It was probably the cheapest hotel in downtown, and the first room I got made me see why.

It was an old and dirty room with a door that didn't have a good seal, so it made noise anytime someone else opened or closed a door on my floor.  Also, there was an old tube TV even though the hotel's web site showed a flat screen.  I believe that was the Vintage Room.

After going down to the hotel lobby and showing them their own web site, I was upgraded to a Tower Room.  The second room they gave me did not have a flat screen so they moved me again.  Apparently they were still going through renovations.

Once the room situation was sorted out, I was pretty happy.  Rooms were upgraded from what they used to be and was a great value for around $20-30/night.  I'll likely be staying there again when I head back to Vegas during the week.  Great value.",2014-02-13 09:02:54

One thing I really liked about this place was the clever signs. ""Blessed be the burgers."" ""helluva burger + heavenly shakes"". Kind of blasphemous, but funny. There are more signs in the restaurant as well. I also liked the small towers of fire.. it was fairly cold when we went so it was very nice and good at warming you up!

Okay, so I like the inside, but I didn't really like the burger.. I really liked how you can choose everything and make your own burger and what you want in it, but the actual meat itself was only eh. The meat tasted funny.. maybe it had something to do with the all natural + hormone free thing. Oh, it was also HUGE. So hard to eat. Everything spilling out, bun breaking, burger breaking.. it was more like a huge ginormous salad in the end. Filling though.

The milkshakes are really good too! Friends got the caramel pretzel (it actually has pretzels!) and it was pretty good but I found it way too sweet and too thick for my taste.

My plate appeared a little empty and my steak looked like a kid's size steak; also, it could have been a little more cooked as I ordered it well-done. My boyfriend had a larger cut of meat and he regretted ordering it medium rare because it tasted under-cooked to him. He had a side of mashed potatoes and a salad which he liked. Bread to start our meal was good, though we could have used a bit more butter for it (they seem to be stingy about sauces and butter here). 

We also ordered two appetizers. Crab-stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good, but a very small extra container of 'wild mushroom' sauce cost $3 - that seemed a little silly to us both. We're guests at their restaurant, so why not try to make us happy? The other appetizer was the onion sticks. Basically, glorified onion rings, and the onions were rather mushy.... the batter makes that appetizer - would never order it again, though.  Drinks were not brought out right away, so we had to sit there thirsty (it's 100 degrees outside today here in Vegas). Timely refills on drinks.

The cheeseburger has high quality meat, the Smoke Shack has awesome bacon in it, but my fav is always the Stack Shack which is the cheeseburger plus fried portobello mushroom! The fried portobello surprisingly has cheese inside the batter, so the cheese would flow out of the fried mushroom and melt in your mouth with the cheese burger. Heaven! 

We only waited for less than 10mins in line and there were seats available right away at around 7pm on a Saturday night. Good treat after a movie!

Everyone here speaks either Mandarin or Cantonese, so definitely not even close to authentic sushi.

They have take out-cash only specials with very cheap rolls and nigiri, but I would stick to the mostly cooked ones because the fish doesn't ever taste very fresh--- but I have yet to get sick from eating here so I guess that's good? 

The rice is really bland, and then the fish is also pretty bland and flavourless. I try to pick something with a lot of sauce because then at least the rolls have flavour without having to drench the whole thing in soy sauce and wasabi.

They put a LOT of rice in their orders to really fill you up quickly. I wouldn't come here for AYCE when you can get two take out rolls and fill yourself up for under $10.

I was already in the neighborhood when I saw the storefront and decided to give this place a go. Who doesn't love a PBJ restaurant concept?

The patient, friendly lady at the counter said they've been open for about nine months.

I ordered the Elvis sandwich, complete with peanut butter, banana, honey and bacon, of course. I added on a side of iced animal crackers and a carton (yes, a cafeteria kiddo paper carton!) of chocolate milk. Takeout was appropriately placed in a brown paper bag.

For roughly $6, it's a decent, tasty lunch. The sandwich was good, although I would've preferred the bread to be grilled vs. toasted.

My biggest caveat? Mostly I was annoyed with the awkward menu placement. Perhaps because it's a small space, but the menu in its entirety is on a side wall. Not only that, but the menu is huge and goes into extraneous detail with the sandwich options. It was an odd interaction to come through the door and stare at the wall on the side and get kind of overwhelmed, since there were easily 30 sandwiches to choose from. I think it could be an easy fix by just shortening the descriptions down to the ingredients.

I'll definitely be back. I think some of the sweeter sandwich options on the menu would be great for drunken munchies or a late night snack.",2016-09-29 02:05:44

I ordered the small beef combo with brisket, short ribs, and skirt steak. With that they offer you either soy bean soup, Tofu soup, or kimchee soup, took the kimchee soup. Depending how much people are at your table they give you steamed buns! If you have three people you get three pieces, or two people you get two pieces. The sides for dinner is limited; it commonly came with kimchee, broccoli, and potato salad. Their chives salad is very good with the rice and meat. They provide multiple sauces for you. Also, their kimchee pancakes are delicious, you have to pay extra if you want more. They bring out the meat and cook it right in front of you, if there are any burnt marks they cut it off for you! They bring out a steamed egg as well for your party to enjoy. I ordered a citron sake during my first visit with friends so our total came out to $90 with tax and tip. But when I came back with my fiancè with just ordering the combo my total came out to $70 with tax and tip. 

Quality wise it is worth it and I get very full because of the continuous refill of our sides. If you're not a sides person and just goes straight in with the meat and rice then you won't get full - in my opinion because of the quantity of meat. However, utilize the steamed egg, soups, salads, sides, pancakes, and buns they give you beforehand to kind of fill you up!

There is nothing simple about this room. To begin with, it is on the 39th floor with a beautiful view of the strip. The room is spacious and makes you feel very comfortable. The color schemes chosen for this room are very smart and modern in combination with the white walls which create an art deco feel. 
There is an area providing a modern stainless steel kitchen as well as a modern spacious bathroom with a very cool large walk-in shower. As you pass this, the bedroom is welcoming with an incredibly comfortable king sized bed and next to that is a small living room with a second flatscreen TV, as the bedroom already has one. The flat screens are large and there's also a small flatscreen in the bathroom. The view of this room was of the strip and all I can say is absolutely beautiful. All of this described is in the form of a large and spacious studio.
Something that I found interesting is that there is a $250 deposit on this room with a no party rule that one must sign for and this deposit gets returned to you when you check out. I actually like this because it was quiet and so pleasant and I got a great night's sleep. The Palms Place has a sky tube that connects it to the Palms hotel on the second floor. They are only a short one minute distance from each other via this tube. This is very smart as on the side of the Palms hotel, there are terrific restaurants, and incredible concert venue, and a very large movie theater with IMAX.
I highly recommend Palms Place to anyone that really enjoys a very nice room for a very affordable price with nice views and peace and quiet when you want to sleep.

To begin the deviled eggs were nothing compared to the ones at Del Friscos. Lacked flavor and taste. My wife had the Swordfish which was good, and I had the Neiman Short Ribs - bad decision - it was mainly thin flat meat with fat and tasted bathed in salt.

This is pub fare with flaire, and for me anyway, gluttony at its best. You have burgers and sandwiches, which come with duck fat frites or you can sub a poutine (chilli cheese with bison and bacon among others) or a exceptional mac and cheese ($10) with bacon (+3). 
They also have sharing platters as well.  
AND some dishes you can add a Foie Gras for $18 (to your sandwich, burger) etc. 

They seem to make lots of accommodations about dietary restrictions. Like you can get a pulled pork sandwich without the pork!

Everyone's meal looked excellent today. I got the Sloppy Josephine (braised lamb shank in duck fat, on a foccaia) with a side of mac n cheese , even though i know it was so bad for me I had to try it. And it was just as amazing as everyone says it is. If you like mac n cheese, go for this.

The portions are quite big. I think I could have just eaten this MacNCheese side on it's own and it would be for me. Although the guys in the group finished off their giant bison burger. Oh, and you can get the MacNCheese to be gluten free. 

Its a bit more pricey than you would expect it, but packs in much more flavour than your typical chain restaurant, and has a lot of heart in the presentation. It was $30 for my meal today. 

Will definitely be back for sure! Everyone loved it.",2013-01-11 19:14:51

I have been a Bandera fan for as long as I can remember. Everything on their menu is tasty and high quality. Most frequently my family and I ordered to go; we ordered ribs, chicken, house salad with cornbread croutons, a burger, and fries with spicy mayo (don't forget the spicy mayo). Ordering to pick up could not be easier, you call and order and then they bring your food and bill out to your vehicle. Oh and let me tell you, every single time the order is correct! 

Once we got our food home it was still warm and ready to eat. Oh my gosh, the ribs were absolutely incredible! The sauce and the temp that they cook them in are something special. The chicken was juicy and had wonderful flavor, and the burger was cooked perfectly. The house salad is a decent salad on its own, but when you add the dressing and cornbread croutons it is taken to another level; so yummy! The only thing that wasn't up to par were the fries; they were seasoned well, but were not fully cooked which was a disappointment. 

If to go isn't your thing you are in luck, the restaurant itself is lovely. It is in the heart of old town and has a traditional and comfortable atmosphere. Just make sure to call for a reservation or get there early, because it is a popular place. The best thing about dining in is the way it smells...heavenly!

I admit, I've heard a lot of different things about this place, but it wasn't until I actually moved North of this place that I started coming here on a regular basis to run errands and get stuff done. 

Lets be honest, of course there's other places to shop in town, but I think it's also fair to say that this place will never be Scottsdale Fashion Square, but then again, not everything will be.

The pros:

I think their trying to make this place better.  There's a really nice Target, movie theatre, Costco and a few other shops that seem to have brought a cleaner, nicer environment to being here and a few places to eat in and out of the mall that are a okay.  There's nothing fancy about this place, but there's enough of a draw that I find myself here weekly running errands.

Yes, it's a weird mall, (and I really don't consider it a mall, as more of a shopping center, but hey, that's just me)

The Cons:

I think the weakness is the few stores inside the mall that seem chinsy and the dirty wall mart that make it sad.  Like I said, its all about perspective here.  (never gonna be a Scottsdale fashion square) but its a heck of a lot better then shopping at Metro Center.  (and their trying to bring business back in, at least in the outer circle not the inside of the mall itself.

It's not that I'm to good for some places, but it's a real weak stream of small places that seem more geared to a crowd of teenagers, but hey, that's just me.  I know s this mall only has so much potential, but I feel like some of the random stores between Costco and Wal-Mart really don't appeal to most people.

I still come here for the big box stores and a few others, but this place is a solid 2 stars, sometimes 3 depending on what kind of experience I have that day. I also like that the Costco food court is open to anyone and located outside of the store in the food court area versus inside the store where you have to be a member to eat there.  Big bonus points for that alone.....",2013-05-23 15:41:24

We ordered 3 entrees. General Tsos, Chow Mein and the Warer boiled chicken.

The Tsos and Mein were decent at best. The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef.

We told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb.

No Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab.

Barre is some kick-your-ass kind of workout.  As an outsider, I always thought it looked kind of easy and didn't really get what the all the buzz was.  Boy, was I wrong.  I left this class exhausted and felt productive.  I was dripping sweat the whole way through the class, too.

I called Xtend before I booked the class to ask about the class, socks, and my very sore calf - they were very helpful in explaining to me that the class was adaptable to my needs, which it really was.  My calves gave me no issues during the class and actually felt better afterwards.

The staff and instructor for my first class here were very friendly, non-judgemental, and as I've said - adaptable.  Rachel, though she was super fast in doing the moves and you just had to learn as you went, came around multiple times to make sure I had proper form.  She was also very encouraging and motivating.

However, after a year or two the service & consistency of my orders changed so I decided to move on. Recently I decided to give them another shot. Two weeks ago I ordered the sirloin and lobster special, as you see advertised on TV for $14.99. Arrived and was charged $29.99, which I questioned. They placed my order for the filet, which I did not request & they did not say. I was fine with paying for the filet, but got home and it was rare, when I ordered my sirloin medium, ugh! So, tonight, I ordered the simply grilled mahi, served with rice and veggies. Upon arriving I paid and checked my order, no rice. I walked in and did receive a side of rice, however, when I got home the fish was so fishy, it smelled so bad I could not believe it. I threw it away and luckily had a piece of fish from Clean Catch, that I picked up today and was saving for Sunday dinner, but cooked that up to go along with my veggies.

It's pork mixed with other things but it seemed mushy.   The dish itself (i forget what it was called) but it was on the specials board beside the register) was ok.... It had lots of julienned veggies, cold noodles, pork and the egg roll... I wasn't crazy about it....i was sort of hoping for a hot dish, but this is what the gentleman behind the counter recommeneded.  

The second time, I had the pho.... It was really good... Better than Xinh Xinh.... But I think I like Pho 911's better....

Its a quaint little place, has a style of its own, and it certainly original if anything. But that's where the good pretty much comes and goes. First, price for a hot dog, tater tots and shaved ice is like 11 dollars. Seemed a bit steep but I don't mind paying for good food.  The person working the front counter was 40ish, with blonde hair, and well lets just say she's been under the knife, a good many times.  And well you guessed it, didn't seem to have a clue what was going on, so it was chaos. 

So I ordered a Shaggy Dog which includes chili, slaw and onions. I ordered is sans the slaw. What I got was a blackened beef hot dog, a tasty bun, and something akin to hormel chili. The tots were good if not small a small serving, and the shaved ice was, well shaved ice. I think the problem is their cook was not working that day, so the owner John had to cook instead of work the customers which  led to the problems. My friend ordered a turkey burger it arrived with crumbled all over, (menu didn't indicate it had bacon) so I politely just asked them to take it off. he took about half of it off.  At that point we asked just for a refund on the burger (uneaten), so  he slams the plate and burger in the trash can and mumbles 6.65 to the cashier??

Chicken Panang Curry (Thai Hot)
Beef Basil (Medium)

I love the flavors of both of these dishes. The crushed peanut and coconut milk flavors present in the panang curry are really good. Add in the earthiness of the chili and I am sating primal desires. Then the beef basil comes into play and I am taken to another realm. They use real Thai basil. I don't care for Italian basil; I just don't like the flavor. Thai basil, on the other hand, has this wonderful licorice flavor that melds so wonderfully with the beef in its brown sauce.

We wanted to get boiling crab but it was already closed so we gave this place a shot. The ambience is just like boiling crab. It even smelled good. What is cool about this place is that they have a lobster claw machine, where if you were able to grab it, you could win the lobster and they would cook it for free. 

I wanted to order half a pound of shrimp with a side of rice and French fries. I usually do half a pound of shrimp because I can't finish a pound of shrimp when eating with rice. When I got my order she gave me a pound of shrimp. This got me very confused because I ordered only half. Then she told me that they don't sell half a pound and only by the pound. The server never told me that. And I asked her if I could return the rice then. Thankfully the manager was very nice about it and said the rice would be free. And apologized about the confusion. The sauce is okay, they don't give enough. I had to ask for more sauce. The sauce costed extra but didn't charge me because of the whole shrimp confusion. 

After my whole experience, I realized I still like boiling crab better. The employees are nice but the food is mediocre.",2016-01-23 01:46:28

Pros: *a huge dining space

           *Pepsi products, including Mt. Dew

Cons: *fish tanks with dead or dying seafood (isn't the point to keep     them alive?) I nearly squealed when I saw they had geoduck, which I have always wanted to try, but then was repulsed when I saw the glazed eyes of the red fish all around them in the same tank.
            *too many servers for each customer. I think we had a different person bring us each item. Doesn't this add to the confusion when there is already a language barrier? There were several errors made (I was brought the wrong entree, they forgot our soup, etc.).

The Food...I ordered the 10oz Strip Loin with mashed & veggies. The Strip Loin was undercooked  & had way to much grizzle running through it making it tough to chew. The mashed were the garlic mashed from the potato pearls, not real potatoes but tasty nonetheless. The Caesar dressing was tasty but a little runny. What was really good was the Molten Lava cake w ice cream...THAT was delicious!

Now to the service....it was slow & rushed all at once. The waiter was clearly rushed & was unable to provide quality wait service. He was perspiring, harried & impatience combined. A fellow diner saw him roll his eyes when one of our diners took their time in ordering....that's NOT COOL if your a waiter! In his defence it was Valentines Day & the restaurant was quit busy but not packed. He lacked the training & skill to effectively deliver service during this time of operation. 

In my opinion given the combination of service, food & timing (Valentines Day) this all adds up to only a 3-Star Restaurant.",2017-02-16 22:34:14

I came here for happy hour yesterday evening. Wow, what a great crowd. I knew they must be doing something right when I saw how many people were there.

They have specials every night... but last night it was martini night. I hit for cycle on the martini menu. My personal fav was the Berry Martini.. and this is coming from a girl who lives and dies by a dirty martini. Yeah, the Berry was that tasty. The French was also great. Let's be honest, they were all pretty fantastic.

My friend and I got a variety of food. Fat kids, party of two. It was all amazing, but let's get back to those mussels. Peppers, onions and chorizo in a spicy sauce. I couldn't stop dunking pieces of bread in it. I may have went through a loaf. At one point, I was dipping fries in it. I would probably have taken shots of it if other people weren't around to judge me. 

I love oysters and they have a great variety here. So fresh and perfect with all the fixings. The butter poached lobster was another fav... served with potato gnocchi and black garlic beurre blanc. Little pillows of goodness.

We also had one of the steak dishes and the pan seared scallops. Both were cooked to perfection. The scallops had sweet corn puree, fava beans and smoky sauce. Great flavor combination.

The service was just tremendous. Our server Laura was on point. So friendly, professional and fantastic at her job. Every staff member and manager who came by were the same way.

The combo included fried rice, but we opted for regular steamed rice.  It was just 4 of us and the food was too much!

It's a bit of an unprepossessing affair from the outside, but once you step into the lobby, the soaring ceiling with juxtaposition of dark and light woods, mixed with the stacked-stone columns and colorful patterned carpets, make for an impressive entrance. Check-in was smooth and easy, and I was given a room right away at 11:30am on a holiday weekend. Between the lobby and the outlying buildings housing the guest rooms is a large tropical oasis divided into different areas. There are two pools, one with a sand bottom at one end. There's lots of lush vegetation, plus some grouped seating areas in peaceful garden settings with water features. The rooms are obviously remodeled from some mid-market hotel (I don't know what the history of the property is) and are located in four two-story buildings making a U around the pool area. The hallways are a bit low-ceilinged and slightly musty, but the rooms have been given spiffy Kimpton makeovers. They're a pretty decent size, with plenty of room to walk around the bed and back and forth to the bathroom and a wide entryway. The entryway has a nice wooden flooring, then there's patterned carpet in the sleeping area. The bed is comfy, my bathroom was large with marble tiling and a separate small vanity table--though I had one of the accessible rooms, so I don't know if they are all this size. The patio is a small area which looks directly onto... a fence, at least from the first floor. (This is not a hotel built on views.) One other note, when I first got in the room, I kept thinking I was hearing distant thunder outside. Turned out it was maintenance employees rolling trash cans and service carts through the asphalt parking lot behind the fence. 

Tried a massage at Jurlique. The massage itself was enjoyable (and a full hour instead of the 50 minutes some places do) with very attractive treatment rooms that felt almost like a fusion of Moroccan and Old West. However, be aware that this is a tiny spa with a postage-stamp lobby and no amenities such as changing rooms, a separate pool, plunge pools, etc. The rates, however, are comparable to the amenity-laden spas in the Valley. 

The lobby bar is an extension of Taggia restaurant. Had a couple of drinks there and the bartender was highly efficient and very friendly, despite the fact that some of his customers that evening were PITAs (my acronym for Pain in the... Butt). 

Across the street from the hotel is Roaring Fork, which has a pretty bangin' happy hour that starts at 4pm, with $4-$10 appetizer plates and lots of $5 drinks. It's worth a stop-in to kick off an evening (or to hit if you can't wait for the free wine hour at 5pm at Firesky) but get there early--every seat was taken by 4:30. It's also not far to Old Town Scottsdale, where we poked around for the evening. We took a cab down there, but decided to walk back since it was a nice breezy night. 

All in all, Firesky is a great choice for a quick stay if you want the urban Scottsdale feel and access to Old Town because of its location and pretty high energy level. It's not the place if you're looking for a more laid-back full resort experience.",2015-09-18 20:09:28

The food is a little better than those national chain breakfast spots...but it's nowhere near phenomenal either. The concept of the restaurant is sound, and it seems like the owner's intentions are good; but the execution isn't fully up to par.

NOTES:
+The biscuits are indeed good. Big, fluffy, hot, & fresh. They're even a tiny bit crispy on the outside. Very tasty...and I don't even usually like biscuits.
+Served with real butter (not margarine). Nice.
=Bacon was decent...crispy, and not super greasy. But it wasn't super thick and meaty (and apple-smoked) like some of the better breakfast spots.
=The chili was ok. But it could have used less cumin in the recipe. There was so much that it almost had a curry taste.
+My eggs were cooked perfectly! A perfect over-medium. That's difficult for a lot of restaurants to get right. Props.
=Hashbrowns were decent. Not very flavorful though...and they aren't really generous with them either. Potatoes aren't THAT expensive, and it looks better when the plates come out full.
-Corned beef hash was awful. Too many green peppers in it. That's all you tasted. Bad recipe. I wonder sometimes if the chef/cook even loves to eat when I taste a recipe that off.
+Generous with the soda. They give you an extra little container with your initial (big) cup of it -- that way you're in no danger of running out. [I personally don't drink that much, so it was wasted on me, but I appreciated the thoughtfulness.]
+Service was good. Friendly. Speedy. They even took the corned beef hash off of my bill because I really didn't like it. Very cool.

Overall, tremendous upside for Biscuits. It definitely has potential. I'll probably be back at some point, but it's not at the top of my list of things to do. Still, I wish them the best. I hope they continue to improve because Ahwatukee could use a solid diner-style breakfast spot.",2011-02-26 01:12:53

Hooking up the utilities, transferring residency, new driver's licenses, insurance all hang heavy on our ""Things to take care of"" list while moving.  Many people overlook something so important as to who will be providing maintenance on our everyday family movers; our cars/trucks/vans.  Enter:  Keffer VW!
We're lucky here in the greater Charlotte area b/c we have several VW dealerships within just a half-hour of one another.  My family and I just recently moved here from an area with just ONE dealership within an hour's drive!  Needless to say, they were not motivated to really offer the care and attention to their customers as a major purchase would normally dictate.
After looking into the local VW service shops, I decided on Keffer due to a) their location, b) their online scheduling tools, c) cleanliness of the shop, d) attentiveness of service technicians and customer services, and e) professionalism and prices for services.
I had heard good things about this dealership and their service center from members of a VW forum sites, and was not disappointed.  The waiting area was comfortable and they offered coffee, ESPN, and magazines to read while waiting.  The customer service personnel were friendly and helpful, explaining the process, recalls, services, and schedule of fees.
After such a horrific experience at my previous service center, I was hesitant to try another.  But with Keffer VW, I feel like my safety and that of my family is well cared for.",2010-12-17 22:43:35

Only 11 tables there in the little restaurant area which is overflow to the buffett and cafe if needed. WHen we walked in (we were the first ones there as it opened) we were asked by the sassy hostess if we had a reservation. When we replied no, that we tried to make a reservation online and couldn't, she only replied ""operator"" like we were schoolchildren.
Apparently this is a popular spot for the elderly, as we were the youngest diners in the room during our hour and half stay (and I'm mid 40's). The one waitress knew most of the patrons by name and was a little to casual to us for my liking for the ""upscale"" prices and ambiance this restaurant was supposed to have. Butter tasted terrible for the bread, the filet had NO flavor to it and my friends beef was overcooked. We ordered the French onion soup and it wasn't a regular french onion soup, don't know how or what they did to it, but you basically had to put the bread in the soup after it was brought to you and so no cheese on top of the bread baked on.
There came a sauce with mushrooms on all beef selections and that was not specified in the menu OR by the waitress. It wasn't very good. I would have liked to have been told that it comes with a mushroom sauce ON the steak. 
We were offered a free dessert due to my friends steak being overcooked and the dessert of Creme brûlée tasted frozen and cold on top, and runny on the inside.

My mom & I decided to try this place after an amazing day of hiking at Red Rock & we were starving. Looked to Yelp as I have many times and noticed this place and the great reviews it has.

The decor is very simple and everything is clean & in place, loved it! Anyone into Japanese rap? I am! Honestly I thought Eminem was rapping in Japanese for a minute and I loved it! They also have their own version of Nicki Minaj and now I want to go check out all these artists in Japan! Also, the bathroom was very modern and smelled really good! Nice!!!!!

Ok so now to what matters most, the food. Loved everything! Stand outs were the Red Tiger & Sushi Bomb rolls! They also carry super white and allow you to order half rolls! Management - thank you for making good decisions :) There's only one dish I wouldn't order again and that was the Korean BBQ. Smelled like heaven but was too chewy for my liking. The sushi was so good! Watching my mom eat literally everything including uni made my heart smile! Her chopstick skills were also on point!

I have to admit that these are not the prettiest of sandwiches around. The main reason for the slight unattractiveness of the sandwiches has to be the amount of delicious flavors squished between two pieces of bread. I mean, I couldn't even pick out what I liked most about my sandwich because it was bursting with deliciousness. 

On my first visit here (and definitely not my last), I tried out the Reading Rainbow. It comes with avocado, cheddar cheese, and Ike's red pesto (which is a pesto with sun-dried tomatoes...so good!). I added tomatoes and red onion to my sandwich and ordered it on the dutch crunch bread. Oh my god, that bread is seriously delicious! Do not order anything else. They also add their dirty sauce to almost every sandwich. I can be a bit of a picky eater and I didn't dislike anything on my sandwich, which means that dirty sauce must've been pretty tasty. I also ordered chips and a drink which were pretty standard. The sandwich comes with a carmel-apple lollipop which I thought was a fun little treat. 

I absolutely have to mention Ike's incredibly diverse menu options. Holy crap they have some serious sandwich selection here! If you're a vegetarian (or just mostly enjoy vegetarian options like me) or if you're a meat eater, you're set. I may have taken at least fifteen minutes to make a decision and I can't wait to try more. They also have awesome gluten free choices. It's pretty much impossible to be disappointed here. 

The character of this place is like none other around town. Mesa just got cooler because of the addition of Ike's. Like waaaaaay cooler. I live about thirty minutes away and it's definitely worth the drive. That being said, I hope they spread to other locations around the valley soon. Like ASAP! The shop is bright and funky and had some sweet nineties tunes playing during my visit. They're not lacking in character here. Oh and did I mention the awesome staff? So friendly and helpful. Chase is doing an awesome job of running the place...his energy is contagious. Ike's is definitely the best sandwich shop I've tried in a long time.

I left my place around 11:00, called Kaya and they put me in for a reservation for 11:45. Parking in the strip can be a major PAIN, so this worked out perfectly. I was disappointed to see that chicken and waffles were NOT on the menu! Apparently the waffle maker has been broken for a couple of weeks and they are waiting for the new one to come in. I was super disappointed because after reading reviews on yelp, I knew I had to try the chicken and waffles. After grieving for about a minute (lol), I started looking at the menu and decided on the ""huevos rancheros"" (spelling?). I asked for extra potatoes in place of black beans, which our server said wasn't a problem at all!

OMG. A grilled tortilla, three large pieces of peppered bacon, a heavy portion of fried potatoes with sautéed red onions and peppers, grilled pineapple, scrambled egg whites with salsa verde and guacamole. A perfect breakfast combo in my opinion! It was amazing! Packed with flavor- I LOVED the eggs with the salsa verde and the bacon was unbelievable. The guacamole tasted almost exactly like mine =]. I was a little disappointed in the grilled pineapple- I was expecting pineapple rings, not small chunks... but it was tasty none the less. My boyfriend ordered their breakfast burrito with waffle fries. He was given a breakfast burrito with hash browns- a little annoying, but he didn't mind. He loved his burrito. 

As we were eating, we couldn't help but observe the plates of a table next to us. It appeared as if most of the patrons had ordered the kaya burger and we could NOT believe how HUGE it was for only $11. I couldn't believe that mine was around that price as well- the portion was huge! I couldn't even finish all of the potatoes. Our meals and three non-alcoholic drinks totaled to $30, which was really reasonable for the quality we received! We were super impressed and can't wait to come back ESPECIALLY when the waffle maker is up and running!

One thing that disappointed us was the service. It was extremely slow at times and we almost felt as if we weren't viewed as important as the large table of patrons at the table next to us. You know it's a bad sign when you have to leave your card on the table for an extended period of time. Especially when your table is directly by the kitchen entrance and your server walked past about 5-7 times before noticing. Our server was very friendly, don't get me wrong, we were just disappointed in the amount of time it took to get our check.

I really have no idea what this meat is made of but it's incredible to think that the taste is so close to the real thing.  Honestly, you put their dishes next to the real thing and do a blind taste test and you'd certainly have trouble.  I only tried a few dishes but each was very good.  I had to try the kung pao chicken as I hear many people really enjoy that.  I also wanted tot try to the vegan bbq appetizer as I'm a big char siu fan.  To begin, the kung pao was your typical dish with zucchini, peanuts, peppers, and their rendition of chicken.  I thought it could have had more spice, but overall the portion size was solid and the dish had a good taste.  The bbq pork didn't quite have the strong tast of a char siu, but it was pretty close, especially in Vegas where it's very hard to find a quality bbq Chinese pork.  The prices were maybe a $1 or $2 higher than other take out Chinese, but the uniqueness and selection was great and I believe worth the extra few bucks.  They have a vegan burger joint opening up as well, so I will surely come back to Veggie House and try their beef and fish dishes and also try Vegeway when it opens in late September 2016.",2016-09-12 00:13:56

You can easily spot PT's off of Eastern.  There is plenty of parking.  The place itself has much seating.  It was clean and not too smokey when we were there.  There were only a few other people dining there so I thought service would be quick.  

We started off with their pretzels bites served with cheese and honey mustard.   The pretzels were pretty decent but the cheese was not.  It was a watery cheese if you can imagine.  We then split the Big O Burger.  It's topped with bacon, cheese onion rings and sautéed onions.  This was good. It's really big enough for anyone to split and have enough to eat.  

My issue was the service and how long we had to wait for our food.  When there are only a few others in the place, it shouldn't take long to prepare what we ordered.  I would have no problem upping the star rating if the service was better.

The other thing is Banh Mi's don't really seem to go well with coffee.  I never liked bubble tea because of the condensed milk, so I steered clear of those.  Everyone in the place besides us was a student on their labtop writing papers for their deadline.  I have to say I like the way the place is set up.  It is very welcoming.  It makes for a nice place to go for some coffee, so I may be back at some point.  I am not really jumping out of my pants to get there again, but it is alright.",2018-03-20 02:26:45

Sides were good nothing too extravagant. The cut of the prime rib was great but it wasn't hot and it didn't taste fresh. It got cold real fast.

Tony's is definitely an original, one-of-a-kind place for ice cream and Southern comfort food. It is not often that I get to go here, in fact it has been nearly five years since the last time I visited Tony's! Still, Tony's has not changed a bit as far as I can tell. The place seems frozen in time - and I like that. This place is very family friendly and is all about the food - especially the ice cream.

Since I only had ice cream this time around, I will write about that... Ice cream is made next door from what I understand and comes in tons of flavors. If you are unsure about anything, just ask for a sample. I had a half scoop of black cherry and a half scoop of black walnut. It was so good and I could not believe the portion. Also, the price was very reasonable too since it was just six dollars for two waffle cones (one for me and one for my wife). If you compare that to Stone Cold Creamery, Ben and Jerry's, etc. you will find $3.00 a cone to be a great deal!

In my experience, the service is great here and the staff is amazingly polite which is a major plus for me. Please, thank you, yes sir and yes mam are a standard part of the lexicon here.

On the one hand, it's near the airport and features huge plastic models of airplanes and jeeps strewn about the grounds - so naturally, you'd think it's some sort of ghastly playground-themed restaurant, and when you walked in the waiters would wear camouflage helmets and snap to attention with a ""YOUR ORDER, SIR!"" when you walked in.  

So imagine your surprise when you walk in and find what is attempting to be an elegant restaurant, with cloth tablecloths, high-end dishes, and a menu that is fairly spendy.  

Your best bet is to come early in the evening, well before sunset, and go up on the roof for drinks.  You can watch the planes take off as you buzzbomb your consciousness with overpriced beer, in a convivial atmosphere.  It's definitely a swell way to spend a night, and unfortunately we haven't been able to make it to the dance nights they have.  

If you wander downstairs, the food is pretty good - I knock off a star for the prices, but if the entrees were about three to five bucks cheaper it'd be just fine.  As it is, yes, I can't shake off the feeling that I'm paying for big plastic planes.  

The food is fairly straightforward - it's American cuisine, with steaks and chicken and nice bread, served on bone-white plates.  Nothing fancy, but nothing poorly done either; it won't exactly tickle the palates of your foodie friends, but it won't make them retch either.  

In the end, this is a great guest restaurant.  If your parents are in from out of town, bring them here!  They'll love it, and it's not a bad place to go out to eat.  But as for eating here regularly, I'd find it a little rich for my blood AND I'd find the menu to be fairly shallow.

There was no wait time for us and they have patio seats available as well so we took that option as it was a great day outside. The servers were friendly and pointed me in the right direction in terms of food options. 

I ordered the asado beef steak and fries which came with the option of soup of the day or market salad as a side ($26). The beef steak was cut into small pieces with pesto sauce on top. The steak was cooked to perfection - charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside. The pesto sauce went really well with the steak. The fries had a nice flavor to it and so did the salad - subtle lemon flavors which were enough for me to finish eating them both! This says a lot about how good it was because I usually have a hard time finishing all my side dishes! 

My friend got the featured fugazza (Argentinian pizza) with the sides of daily soup and fries ($16). The size of the pizza was good for one person to finish for sure. It was a pesto prosciutto feature the day we went which was a really great combination. They definitely do not skimp out on the cheese which was great! The more cheese the better right?

The restaurant is on the smallish side but there is additional seating outside. I think all the construction on Markham street is probably keeping people away as the other restaurants in the area were dead as well. 

I thought the food was good as far as burgers and wings go. The menu just had burgers (either beef or chicken) and about 30 types of wings and a few appetizers. Service was fast and friendly. Prices were maybe slightly above average on the burgers. I tried the following:

- Spicy buffalo wings. They were really good, lot's of meat on the bone but not very spicy. 

- Peppercorn Chicken burger was really good but a bit pricey at $16

- My friend had the beef burger which they enjoyed as well

Limited bar menu, I had a few Shock Top pints with my meal. 

The atmosphere improves immensely when there is a band / musician playing. The patio becomes a ""party"" spot. I would go back when I'm in the mood for burger/wings but the limited menu limits frequent visits.

The set up is much like other makeline driven businesses. Start at one end, pick your base, add all of your other choice add-ins, pay, eat. Their system is really simple and they make it efficient for sushi. We order three rolls total --two california and a veggie. The rolls take the staff a little while to prepare since they have to portion out the rice, nori, add all of the veggies, roll it up AND THEN they have this brilliant slicer machine! That was the most exciting moment for me. How smart they are...

We ordered the miso soup to go along with our sushi. Pretty standard and so good with the sushi. The cali rolls were great. Just as they should have been. The veggie rolls were good as well. Fresh, flavorful, simple, and filling. 

This is pretty much exactly what you should expect from a quick casual sushi place. The price is reflective as well. We ate for less than $20 for the two of us and were very full. If I were in the market for a quick lunch, I'd head back in a heartbeat!",2012-10-23 13:46:22

Appetizers: Grilled squid with some greens and sauce - all you could taste was salt. Charcuterie plate - this was pretty good, good cuts of meat with some bread and mustard to dip. The only decent dish of the night.

Mains: Sirloin (which, by the way, they are supposed to be known for) - we all ordered them medium, and all were done closer to medium well/well. All tough, chewy, unflavourful, slabs of meat that went unfinished. The potatoes accompanying the main were undercooked, and the greens were so salty they were un-edible (they seem to love salt at this place). My friend ordered the chicken and it was also very dry and had an odd taste to it. 

We would have brought this up to the server (especially the funky smelling/tasting chicken and leather-cooked meat), but alas, he never stopped by to check on us during the meal.

She invited me over here after work one day and I said, ""You mean Time Out Lounge, right? Are you joking Monkey Pants? Normally that is said like a punch line...right?"" She giggled. ""They take cards-TOL is cash only. And its fucking cheap."" Well. Cheap drinks get me every time. Sure, I 'll try Monkey (snicker) Pants.

As I pulled up, I kept looking around, maybe worried all the hipsters from TOL or Yucca would stand in shock and point down the strip mall ""Yo! You in the 'ironic' Genesis shirt and cat eye glasses-didn't you mean to get some shitty beer and download some Pixies on THIS side of the strip mall?!?"" And I would have to say...""Yes. I wasn't gonna go to a fucking place called MONKEY PANTS-plfft- C'MON!""

But...Confession 2: I love Monkey Pants. Dude, they take CARDS. Their happy hour is incredibly HAPPY. Buck fifty wells in a PINT glass, heavy handed? Cheap huge basket of fries? Reasonably priced beer ANYWAY? Trivia cards strewn about? Terrifying teddy bear wearing 80s workout clothes, taunting me to be a winner on their wall? More TVs than ""Videodrome"" or a bad 80s performance art piece (or Remote Control's Champion Room-yeah, MTV reference)? And just when you think you can't triple fist cheap G&Ts any longer...8pm rolls around and its SPECIALS time! Yippie!

Confession 3: I have been here more times than Time Out Lounge...during the day. TOL is for late at night. MP is for when you wanna get someone drunk you don't want your friends to know about and do them fast...and hit the hot hipsters for sloppy scenester seconds after midnight, ya know? Listen, I'm poor. And 15 bucks for being so trashed I had to call up a friend to help me to their house ONE BLOCK AWAY (twice) for over three hours of fun. Shit.

Yeah, the decor is kinda weird, a little Ground Roundish, I love the Legs Lamp, the bathroom is in the weirdest place ever, and you won't find your dream lover in front of the acoustic set they have. But Nate at the bar will take care of you (and your broken dreams), the regulars are ridiculous and your smoker friends can chill on the front patio and bring their drinks with 'em. Plus they have all this popcorn and you can throw at your friends near the shuffle board.

We walked into the restaurant a little after 6.  The place was half empty.  However, we were told by the snooty hostess that we had to sit at the bar for cocktails before being seated in 45 minutes.  We were a little frustrated because neither of us drink and it seemed an obvious scheme for them to get more money out of our pocket book.  When we declined her invitation she rolled her eyes and looked away, her counterpart whispered to her and pointed to some open tables.  She shook her head, I can only assume she did not want to accommodate us at the open tables.

We were seated shortly after by the manager.  Though we continued to receive a few glares throughout the evening from the hostest and one of her little friends we saw her whispering to after our encounter.  I eventually had to switch seats with my BF so I didn't have to witness their stares.  Sheesh.  This was unreal, you would have thought I made out with her high school boyfriend. 

As for the food, I ordered the chop salad again, as well as the tomato red pepper soup.  Now this may sound weird but when I tasted the soup, it took me back to an old family friend's farm.  When my BF asked how I liked it, I told him it tasted like cows.  He tried it and agreed.  It almost had a hay-like aftertaste.  I still ate it and I'm still perplexed by it's flavor.   

Regardless, most of my experiences have been better than this and I'm really hoping that this visit was just a fluke.  I'm sure at some point we will try this restaurant again but to be honest, I'm not anxious to run back like I once was.",2010-10-23 16:49:36

Fanucce's is a neighborhood Pizzeria in the heart of downtown Willoughby on Erie Street.  At first glance, this restaurant seems destined for success: great location to take advantage of the resurgence of downtown Willoughby, complimentary valet parking, an alfresco approach to dining with outdoor tables and chairs flanking Erie Street, smells of freshly baked pizza permeating the air. How could you possibly go wrong? 

Well for one, it would help if the staff noticed you. It was Fanucce's that three local Yelpsters decided to meet up this past Saturday evening. I was the first there at 7:30pm and even though the place did not yet see it's Saturday night rush, I had to hover by the cash register to ask for a menu and drink as the waitress never came over to my table. The giant sloth behind the counter didn't even get up to acknowledge me. Instead, his ass glued to a seat, scooted himself up to the counter and handed me one of their finest selections: a Vortex infused Miller Lite. I told the sloth that I'd be expecting 2 more in a bit and to warm up the oven in anticipation.

When the rest of the crew showed up, we moved the party of 3 into the dining room as the rain washed us out from sitting outside. The sloth, before a little resistance almost didn't allow us to sit. He said he was expecting a table of 4 and we were sitting in the last seat in the house. Hey sloth, remember us? We were here first! 

Once seated, we hovered at the cash register and begged for another round. The sloth seemed bothered. After two more beers were swilled, we started to grow hungry for pizza, an appetizer, a crumb, anything! Yet we waited and waited some more. Through the entire time we were there, no one acknowledged us. Well, almost no one. At one point, an old timer behind the pizza oven walked by us, complaining about how he should've remained retired and to that I say, I certainly agree Sir! Go back to the tiny community in Florida with the rest of the geriatrics, because you're certainly not doing anyone any favors here!  

After we finally gave up, it was even a struggle to pay. We never got a tab because we had no waitress. The sloth behind the counter had no running count of beers we drank either. If it wasn't early in the night, if I only had a few more Vortex infused beverages and my courage was a bit higher, I would've really lit into the sloth and told the rest of the crew at Fanucce's how I really felt about the place, but I took the higher road... and instead let them have it in form of a nasty Yelp review.",2010-06-07 12:01:29

Had a 65 dollar voucher and spent well passed that with two people, thanks to two ceaser salads that costed 12 dollars a piece which was insane.  I don't think the waitress brought side salads, but the full one instead...so that was pretty deceptive.

Then the hotel charged a bunch of hidden fees.  A 15 dollar a day fee which they offset by giving you a drink coupon for each day which I didn't care for.

So refreshing to have room to move around and to actually try all the things we wanted to try. I'll try to keep my descriptions short and sweet:

DaanGo (aka. Masterchef Baker Siu): Asian inspired macarons (delicious), tarts, and the most Instagramable dessert ever: agar fruit marbles in syrup. $15 for 6 macarons and $6 for a cup of the cool fruit bubbles. 

Fish'D (by EDO): Salmon sushi burrito is exactly what you'd expect. Pretty delicious but also tastes exactly as you'd think a big sushi roll would taste like. $12 for a full one and $7 for half. 

Yakikuza: They did one thing and one thing only: bacon and shrimp okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake). And they did it so well. Deliciously fried batter with sauces and two strips of bacon + small shrimps. Oko-NOM-iyaki indeed. ($8)

Teppan Ice Cream: Cute guys with nice arms rolling ice cream? Uhhh yes, please. I thought these rolled ice cream things would be kinda gimmicky but that was actually delicious. I got the lychee (real lychee pieces chopped up into the cream), with condensed milk and peanuts. $7 for some creamy, creamy goodness. 

There were a ton of other fantastic stalls/food trucks that I didn't get to try like Chocollata Gourmet (beautiful Brazilian truffles), the pork belly bao, and the liquid nitrogen frozen popcorn. Great variety, fantastic quality, and I was pretty stuffed after 2.5 hours there. 

As a note, yes there is a donation amount of $2 requested. Yes, it's voluntary. Yes, there are some lovely ladies that sit at the entrance and ask you, in a very polite way, to donate. If the setup makes you uncomfortable because you feel like you're being ""forced"" to donate, that's your stingy attitude making you feel that way, not the people there (*cough* other review..).

3) Fried chicken Thursdays. This was the reason we were there on a Thursday night. They have fried chicken plates every Thursday, and it is very very good. Upon being seated, we were told they were out of the fried chicken and I was disappointed, so it might be worth it to go a little earlier in the night if you're really interested.

Seems like when lunch time comes around, you just happen to have a location that is conveniently nearby. I have been to this location several times before you guys decided to close down to remodel and boy that seemed like forever. Now that you guys are open, I see that you made the place even better. I think out of all the other locations I have been to, this is definitely the biggest one.

As for the sandwiches, you cant really go wrong with any of them. Except maybe the veggie sandwich. Come on man! What kind of sandwich is that if you don't have any meat up in there? To me that sandwich does not exist except for when I mention that it doesn't exist in this review.

I basically have 4 sandwiches I order as a normal rotation. They are #8 Billy Club, #14 Bootlegger Club, #16 Club Lulu, and if I am really hungry, The JJ Gargantuan (it's so much meat that giving it a number was not gonna be enough).

Sure I can go on and on about what is in these sandwiches but I don't want to waste your time. Just stick to this rule of thumb: If you like ham, roast beef, turkey, and bacon, then any one of those that I mentioned will definitely satisfy you especially the JJ Gargantuan. This monster has salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone topped off with onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian dressing.

Pro tip: If you refer to their menu, there are freebies that you can have them put in your sandwich like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, sliced cucumber, hot peppers, dijon mustard, yellow mustard, oil, vinegar, and oregano. If your sandwich does not normally have these items, they will not put it in your sandwich unless you specifically tell them to. Same thing for freebies that are already in your sandwich. You can order extra of that item. Also don't be afraid to ask for different bread. They give you the standard white bread with all your sandwiches but you can ask for wheat or the traditional sliced bread.

Service will always be lightning quick because of a couple of factors. All the sandwiches they make are cold so there is no time wasted in cooking or heating anything up. Secondly, they have an assembly line type of set up so you have different people taking turns putting stuff in your sandwich.

The only thing that takes that one star away is that because they don't have any hot sandwiches like meatball or a cheesesteak. I love my usual sandwiches but sometimes I gotta have something hot and fresh off the grill. Until they make that happen, it will always be 4 stars from me.

When I move, I like to paint the apartment to make it feel more at home. I always paint it back before I leave. I asked the lady at the office for the exact paint color and she told me the name and stated that I can get it anywhere including Home Depot. So I go and buy this paint and primer and begin re-painting when half way finished I notice it doesn't even match! I call maintenance and he comes in and tells me its the wrong paint and that I can only purchase it at a specific store. Okay... so why does the office not know this valuable information? So they ordered me the correct paint which I am thankful for that I didn't have to purchase another one.. however all of this time could have been saved if the office was more educated about these important rules. 


Gate: Would always break every other week

Parking: hard to find if wanting to invite over a few guests. Sometimes they had to park across the street in the neighborhood and walk over. 

Dog poop: one dog owner would hide their dogs poop under rocks. Every morning I would see squished dog poop smashed under rocks which makes the community look dirty due to a lazy dog owner. I honestly think it takes more effort to find a big enough rock and squish their dogs poop, instead of simply picking it up and throwing it away. Never got a chance to catch who was doing this. 

Tip: Perhaps installing doggy bag poles around the complex like other apartments have will help this issue. 

Best thing about living here that I do miss is the convenient location of being next to North Mountain. Close enough to run to and a beautiful view of the city. Also, the convenience of living next to Scramble was a plus as well. Awesome breakfast.",2014-10-06 07:08:50

There are two highlights on the menu: the burger taking center stage, and the unbelievably good milkshakes.  

While there are several standard types of burgers you can order from the menu, the burger ""money"" is to use the order sheet and choose from the many selections of buns, condiments, and cheese.  One of my friends dining with us has a cheat sheet he brings with him so he can recreate the amazing burger he made on a previous visit.  It's that good.

In this last visit, my husband had the dinaguan (pork stewed in pork blood), kari kari and pinakbet. He said it is the best kari kari and dinaguan he has ever had.  And although he is Puerto Rican, he has had plenty of kari kari and dinaguan throughout our 25-years of marriage to know what he's talking about.

So I figured let's see if they're giving goyemon a run for their money.  HAHAHAHAHA not even close.

Tuesday night, 6 pm and there were 3 people in there, and no one else came in there the hour that I was there.  That's a BAAAAAD sign.  Typically tuesday is when sushi restaurants get their fresh fish and deliveries. If I recall, the fish markets are closed on mondays and there are no shipments.  So Tuesday & Wednesdays are the best days to go.  

Without even asking, they brought me edamame and miso soup.  I don't particularly care for when someone brings me something that I didn't order.  Their miso soup was lacking flavor and only had 2 spoonfulls, their edamame was fine.

On an all you can eat place, portions should be small-medium.  I ordered the sashimi salad and it was in a large bowl (toooo much) and the taste was just ok, it tasted like they put their garlic sauce that they put on their sushi rolls, onto their salad.  Maybe some people like this, but I sure didn't.

Their sushi rolls were avg. I saw lots of rolls on their menu that were based on california rolls and to me that is a sign of cheapness.  Another typical bad sign is when you can't order directly from the chef. They use the paper order forms and quite frankly I HATE the paper order forms.  

I ordered 2 sushi rolls and they were just ok

and then I ordered some nigiri and this sealed the deal that this place is bad...

I ordered 2 hamachi and 1 super white (both were good)
I ordered 1 order each of snow crab, uni and amaebi (sweet shrimp)  I didn't get any of those orders. The show crab was still frozen (I saw him put the large frozen block of it into the fridge behind the counter), and then he apologized they are out of uni and sweet shrimp.  Guess what folks...  Sushi mon and Goyemon are never out of it.

and that leads me back to what I wrote above. Everything is usually fresh/delivered on tuesdays.  So where's your fish at?????

I went at 6p on a Weds evening and there were only two other parties in there. The waitress was attentive and polite. 

The restaurant is severely under decorated, with some Buddhist items and random Chinese things and a fish tank. 

The menu confuses me. I thought it was gonna be a totally vegetarian/ vegan restaurant (like Veggie Delite on Spring Mt and Wynn), but it was a mix. They serve fish (sole) for sure. And there were items with beef, chicken, or pork. But then I got into the meat substitute section of the menu. I thought it was all meat substitute. 

I ordered the honey walnut tofu ($10), but I also wanted a meat substitute dish. All of the items looked pretty tame. I asked my server to recommend something. She asked me, ""You want spicy or no?"" Not spicy, I replied. Then she gave a thinking look, like I'm SOL. So then I said a little spicy is okay. So then right away she recommended a beef and veggie dish ($10, forgot what it was called, but it was the last or second to the last item of the section). The beef sub was good. It looked like beef broccoli, but had all kinds of vegetables. And the texture of the fake meat was good. Not anything that would deceive you to believe that you were eating real meat, but still very good. 

The honey walnut tofu was like honey walnut shrimp. But with tofu. And they put the sweet mayo sauce on the side. When I ordered it, she warned me there was egg in the sauce. The tofu was even lightly battered and fried, like honey walnut shrimp. The tofu sans the mayo glaze is very bland. This is served with steamed broccoli. I love that Chinese people rarely overcook broccoli. 

I also got a brown rice, for which she did not charge me. 

Now here is the strange thing. After she took my order, she went in the back and placed the order with the chefs. And I DIDN'T hear screaming and yelling in Chinese. So strange. 

For dessert, I got a fortune cookie.

Their second best meat may be the pulled pork, which is tender and moist but not particularly tasty.  I tried five of the seven available sides and only one was worth reordering - the creamy slaw.  The meat is served without sauce (""naked"") and the two sauces they have appear to be identical except for the heat, and neither is what you would describe as fabulous.

Prices are typical but since the meat portions are large, Naked BBQ provides a reasonable value.  Ambience is modern lunch counter and does nothing to remind me of BBQ.",2017-05-17 14:41:12

It seemed like it would be good... The menu looked alright, like a typical small Chinese restaurant.  I ordered the General Tso's.  I have to say, it was terrible.  The breading was all wrong, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was an abomination.  Where was the soy sauce?  The ginger?  I submit to you that they simply took sweet and sour sauce, mixed in some hot pepper paste, and called it General Tso's.

If you are driving away from the city there is a barrier to prohibit you from making a left turn to enter. I would advise to go to next traffic light where there is a left turn signal to enter Kuhn's Market and turn around.

Upon arrival the place was basically empty. I was asked if I wanted to eat in or take out. I chose to eat in. Since I like fish tacos I asked about them and was told they were very good. The fish they use is mahi mahi. I didn't have to wait long for my meal to be served. The tacos come in two soft shells, the fish lay on a bed of rice with guacamole sauce on it. They give you a side of sauce. My error in that I didn't test it out first to learn it was a hot sauce. The meal also comes with a side of black beans. I did like the fact the tacos were soft. It can get a bit messy but everything was cooked to order.

I found the fish tacos to be just okay since I'm not used to eating them mixed with rice. You get two to a plate which is enough for me. Over at the next table someone had ordered a taco salad which I was also thinking about. He said it was very good. Prices are reasonable so you can get a decent meal for a decent price. 

My waiter was very attentive to my needs and saw to it my drinks were refilled. This place is small so it is easy to miss. It is located near Potomac Road on Banksville Road.

We went here after hearing about the place constantly on Cleveland news.  My mom and I ordered virgin margaritas which tasted like citrusy Hawaiian punch.  J got the margarita and my dad got a Dos Equis.  We then decided to get the salsa trio and the guac trio - smoked trout, crab and original and were told that we would have to wait cause they make the chips to order.  If that means getting some doritos from the beer store across the street, washing them and heating them in a toaster oven, I would believe that they are made to order.  However, when I hear ""made to order"", I assume you are baking or frying the chips fresh and they should be awesome.  These weren't.  The salsa trio had pico, salsa verde and pineapple-jicama.  The pineapple would have been the stand out, but I didn't like the mint.  I feel it threw the whole flavor combo.  The verde was good and the pico was just too much cilantro.  The plain guac was just that - plain.  I make better at my house.  The crab and corn was interesting, but had not enough corn nor crab.  I didn't taste the smoked trout, but I think that was the same - not enough trout. 

For our dinners, my dad had the bistec taquitos which are basically steak fajitas everywhere else.  The steak was amazing - perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My mom and I both ordered the mahi mahi taquitos.  They were way too spicy without any flavor.  The tortillas were horrible - mealey and bland.  J ordered the scallops with cauliflower hominy and creamed corn.  The scallops were amazing - perfectly seared and fresh.  The corn was to me just spicy.  The cauliflower hominy was a vision - crunchy on the outside, gooey deliciousness inside.  At first we thought it might have crab in it, it was so awesome.  

As we were celebrating, we ordered the chocolate mousse and the jalepeno bread pudding.  I thought both were amazing.  Like amazing.  The mousse was cinnamony and topped with just the right amount of whipping cream and nuts.  The bread pudding was divine - spicy enough to know that you were eating jalepenos, but sweet enough to balance.  It was amazing.  It also came with a sparkler which fell over and burned the wooden plate that it came out on.  Tip:  Don't put fire on wood.

The dinner menu is a bit expensive, so we wanted to try lunch. We had been unable to go, though, because of this place's scarce hours (No Sunday or Monday, I think?). Well, I finally went!

The outside seating is gross. There is no way I'd want to sit outside next to the busy street and the bus stop. I know this isn't really something the restaurant can help, but it might be helpful if they could find a way to separate the seating from the bus stop a little better. My friend and I sat inside instead.

The inside was cozy and quiet when we went. The decor is quite nice. Minimalist and tasteful. The chalkboard menu looked delicious, and perhaps sometime I'd like to come for dinner.

I ordered the Cobb salad for lunch. It came with some flavorful toasted bread, which would have been better if it had a little butter on it. I think it was like rye bread or something...I wasn't sure, but it was tasty. My salad had: mixed greens, cucumbers, red onions, avocados, sliced cherry tomatoes, bacon, hard boiled eggs, chicken, blue cheese, red wine vinagrette, and buttermilk ranch dressing. It was a really yummy salad. They were not skimpy on the ingredients and everything was really fresh.

My friend ordered the Kobe beef lunch burger with white cheddar cheese instead of the Midnight Cowboy cheese (which, by the way, is a creamy blue cheese). He ordered his burger medium rare, but it came out more like medium well to well done. It did not matter, as it was still plenty juicy. I had a bite of his burger and the patty was very juicy and had diced onions in it, which added to the flavor immensely. It was definitely a quality burger.

I'd like to try this place again and get one of the more unusual orders other than a cobb salad. I was just really in the mood for a salad.

My only negative thing to say was that I didn't think the service was all that great. It wasn't BAD by any means, but I had the feeling that the server thought my friend and I were not going to tip well. She did not seem happy at all to be waiting on us. She wasn't rude, but she wasn't really nice either. She was just blah the whole time. My friend and I both have worked in the restaurant industry for years, so this is the kind of thing that really peeves me because I know all too well when a server thinks that their customer will not tip them well. It's a double slap, considering we tip well.

But anyway, other than that, it was a nice experience, and I would love to come back.",2013-07-25 16:17:24

Everyone here works as a team. Helping one another fulfill patron's needs. Seriously. They are on top of it, very observant. After my first bite of anything, server came by and checked on us. 

The restaurant was about 20% full with lots of staff/students. So it was a little awkward with so many eyes on you, at first.

 I had the lunch menu ($10). Along with iced tea ($2.50). Tax (~$2). What a deal, what a steal! 

I should've asked but didnt, but assuming their menu changes often. But I posted pictures of what I had. 

Bread was hot, soft, and refilled! Drinks were never empty.

Everything was delish! Though slightly on the salty side. But the taste of freshness and quality def. shined though. 

Also the vibe that it's a teaching environment is in the air but the students are towards the end of their schooling so they are very well trained.

I was skeptical because as a female, I loathe quick oil change places because I swear they always try to rip me off or put the hard upsell on me. Not here! These guys are HONEST TO A FAULT!

I've taken my special import car here several times and they have been able to change the oil with no problem (not like Jiffy Lube and other places, they always scratch their heads and turn me away). These guys know what they are doing. They are professionals, courteous and HONEST. I trust them completely. 

I recently took my car in to get the oil changed when the oil light came on. I was literally taking it to Carmax to trade it in a few days later. The guys looked at it, showed me the oil (still golden colored) and said they could just reset the light because my oil honestly didn't need to be changed. They reset my light, filled up the air in my tires and topped off the fluids for FREE. How's THAT for service? I would have paid $65 for new oil for no reason! 

These guys never try to sell you more than you need. If your air filter looks good, they won't try to make a quick buck by selling you a new one. If your engine doesn't need the super premium blended oil, they will tell you. Trust and accept their recommendations.

I love this place and will never take my cars anywhere else. It's a safe place for women to go to alone too, you don't have to fear being ripped off! I can't recommend Dino Lube strongly enough. A+ in every way.",2015-05-11 21:02:37

I wanted to call ahead to make a reservation but the phone number for the restaurant does not work during the day, it rings once then goes to a recorded message ""Sorry the number you have called is not a sign"". I called almost every hour from 12 until 5pm and finally by 6pm, the call gets through. Super weird!

When we got there, the place had a few tables, but the vibe felt very empty. There was one server working all night. She seemed like she was either new or have barely any experience at all. She gave us the set menu to choose as we showed her the deal. She came back every 5 mins asking if we were ready and every time we would say we need more time. We asked for water to start off our meal and we didn't get it until 15 mins later after we ordered. And we had to remind her one last time before she came with it, most likely have forgotten when there's only one other table in the restaurant.

She brought over some bread, which seemed like its homemade with a little olive oil drizzled on top of it. But as I took a little bit into the bread, I spilt it right out!! It was SUPER SALTY!!!
Like it was dipped in salt or something!!

Our appetizers came which was the grilled calamari and crab cakes. BOTH were SALTY as well! Calamari was cold topped with some homemade salsa which tasted like diced tomatoes and onions tossed in olive oil. There were canned grilled red peppers on the side but they were cold as if they literally came out of the fridge. 

The crab cake was one round piece size of your palm cut in half. I only tasted potatoes, corn and carrots. There was no crab or didn't see any sight of crab. Tasted like I was eating potato cakes instead. SUPER DISAPPOINTING!!

The mains came, which were a tapilia and 7oz steak, both with vegetables. The tapilia was dry and tasted like it has been in the freezer for ages, it had a FREEZER TASTE! The steak was cooked at the right color but it tasted stale and you can tell by the texture that it's an old piece of steak. The texture felt like it was a medium well when I ordered a medium rare, it looked like a medium rare though, which I got so confused. The steamed/boiled vegetables were the WORSE!!! One big piece of brocoli that had to be boiled for over 10 mins, it was MUSHY like baby food! The carrots were also OVERCOOKED and MUSHY, also like baby food!! The potatoes were yukon gold, cut up into BIG chunks, some were also overcooked so it was MUSHY but there was one piece that was RARE, CRUNCHY when I bit into it. WORSE VEGETABLES I have ever eaten!!

Desserts were a tiramisu and new york cheesecake. The cheesecake tastes okay since you can tell that it was store brought and not made in house. The tiramisu tasted okay but texture was SUPER MUSHY!!

Overall, EVERYTHING IS BAD!! FOOD IS SALTY, MUSHY, totally NOT SUPPOSE TO BE WHAT IT TASTED!! The waitress was weird all night, everytime coming to the table making it very awkward; either trying to rearrange the dishes to make it seem more convinent for us but actually not, trying to ask us about the food but reacting in an awkward way, it just made us feel UNEASY!

I've been to this place 3 times already and each time I just wanna eat more and more (if that is even humanly possible) haha

Ok so I love the fact that they give you the sushi paper so you can take the time you want to really chose what you want.  So the servers don't have to hover over you and you are ummming and uhhhing trying to figure out which crazy sushi roll you want.  
They do take appetizers orders by hand and dessert.  

Appetizers I love to order:
Chicken karage
The yellowtail or salmon Kama
Dynamite 
Beef Fried rice
Pork belly
Mini udon 
Calamari tempura
Shrimp tempura
Mussels 

Rolls I usually get (I like simple flavors) (sorry for the boring list):
Alaska roll
Rainbow roll
Dancing with eel roll 

Desserts I enjoy: 
Red bean ice cream 
Affagato


I just have to say their salmon belly that they serve during dinner time is awesommmmmmme!  It just melts in your mouth.  We really enjoy the fish quality here, it is better than average buffets.  A couple notches below omasake places... oh man, that salmon.  This review is making me want to go back already!  They also don't stuff your face with the rice so that is awesome.

Just keep in mind to not over order!  They will charge you $5 if you leave too much food behind. 
You can also order half rolls if you just want to try some rolls out.  

Also the secret to the desserts is that you can get unlimited ice cream but only 1 of the other things like mochi, panna cotta and stuff.  I like affagatos so that's what I had each time. 

I will def be back for more salmon belly.",2018-05-15 18:04:10

I must admit that I love swimming and pool parties at people's houses but HATE the Vegas/Scottsdale pool party atmosphere. I generally go for the music and to have fun the parties generally feel like a showoff fest than a good time. I work for a living so I don't have time to GTL it to look like a hard-body superstar.

With that said, I went here on a Saturday night and it was DEAD. There was a group of 3-4 people at the back table and one guy sleeping on the flat pool benches - and that was it. I went with 4 other people so we pretty much doubled the place. Got a round of drinks and two people decided to jump in with their clothes on. You guessed it - they were drunk. Their comment about 15 minutes later was, ""oh, it is only 11:45, dang, we thought it was later!"" LOL.

With that said, I just don't think the pool party thing is my thing. The place seemed nice but I just don't care for the atmosphere where it genuinely feels like everyone is judging you because you aren't cool enough because you aren't a beefcake and aren't rocking no-tanlines-anywhere. I didn't go here during a pool party so  Iacn't judge that aspect truthfully. As for my experience, there was basically nothing to experience.",2013-09-15 03:31:24

However, the flavor and quality of the food made up for it. Just know that this isn't a stop and go kind of restaurant.

And let me tell you, I can attest to the fact that the academics at ASU are up to par.  When you're taking 400 and 500 level Shakespeare classes from professors who continually challenge and inspire you, you know without a doubt that this is more than a party school. 

While some majors might be blow-offs, mine sure wasn't.  The professors cared if you came to class or not and usually gave you 5 absences before you got kicked out permanently.  They were serious about this too and took attendance every class.  This meant that I unfortunately, was not one of those students that got the option of skipping class very often. This is just what happens when you're an English Lit. major.

The campus is pretty big and it can sometimes be hard to make it to your next class in the 10 minutes you get if you schedule one after another.  The MU is nice, the campus is kept up well and you have a ton of choices for food, from Pizza Hut to Jamba juice.

I hated going down palm walk because the religious zealots were always there to tell me I was going to hell, but other than that, I had a great time at ASU, balancing going out with friends, working and getting a great education, all at the same time.

Now a part of the community since Summer 2012 and best known for elegant celebration Cakes based on Chef Jones' scratch-made recipes, her skills also on display in Pastries previously available at Hearthstone as well as Portofino, it was a few days after re-opening only steps from the former storefront that Jones was found on-site with her team, the trials and costs involved in the move largely in the rearview mirror and the new space just as cute as ever.

Neither pretending nor intending to be a full-service Café, Jones' current pursuit of State Senate District 9 and family responsibilities undoubtedly creating a busy schedule as Wedding Season looms near, guests visiting the new shop will quickly notice a cooler-case packed with Cupcakes and Cannoli beneath a row of Cookies and Muffins while the group of Bakers works diligently in plain view to the left of entry.

Still building back up to their previous line-up, a total of perhaps two-dozen items currently offered on-site comprised at least 50% of Cupcakes, it was with $20 including tip exchanged that eight items were carefully boxed and bagged to enjoy back at the office, the 8a-6p opening hours from Monday through Saturday definitely appealing for those nearby with a sweet tooth or in need of workday catering.

Presenting everything at prices and portions manageable for most, the Cupcakes $3.50 each or $12 for four while 'mini-Cookies' seem a bit steep at $1.50 for what amounts to a mouthful, it was beginning with a jammy-Thumbprint that one found a good amount of Butter and largely natural sweetness, the follow-up of Oatmeal Cranberry chewy and dense while Peanut Butter with visible grains of Salt and Chocolate Chip laced with Cinnamon both offered a crisp rim and soft-center despite their small surface area. 

Moving next to a Muffin, Banana Nut seemingly the best choice out of three including Blueberry and Gluten Free Chocolate Chip, those who love the Fruit should immediately prioritize a trip to Peridot Sweets to try either this or Tiffany's famous Banana Caramel Cupcake, the former a bit more fluffy under its crystallized Sugar cap while the latter may just be Sin City's best Cupcake, bar-none, at least until Chef Jones begins offering her Rum Syrup-soaked Banana Brigade Cake in an individual size.

Rounding out the order with two additional Cupcake flavors, the second Banana-Caramel selection impressing its recipient who claims to 'not like' sweets, suffice it to say that German Chocolate Cake would have benefitted from more Pecan-Coconut Frosting and less Whipped Cream while the Strawberry Jam version was messy but worth it thanks to the combination of concentrated Fruit and another chance to enjoy Peridot's world-class Cream Cheese Frosting.

FOUR STARS:  As yet short on selections following the move there is no doubt Peridot Sweets remains Las Vegas best Cupcake purveyor even as the boom has come to a close, and with new hours plus a bigger kitchen one hopes Tiffany and her team will be even more successful than prior going forward.",2018-05-04 11:43:33

We headed to Insurrection Ale works because we were looking for a brewery with food and I have had it bookmarked in Yelp for a long time.  It's located right on the Main Street in Heidelberg and so it was easy to find.  We headed in through the main door and went down a few steps to get into the brewery.  While walking down a hall to the dining room we could see some of their brewing equipment off to right.  The dining room itself consisted of a bar and an area which I am going to say used to be a patio but is now enclosed with plastic.  They have heat lamps for whenever it's cold and I imagine they can open some of it up whenever it's warm in the summer.

As I often do whenever I visit a new brewery, I decided to have a flight here.  The only problem with that is that they didn't necessarily have flights although they do have 5 oz tasters that you can order.  So I ended up making my own flight by ordering 4 of the 5 oz tasters.  The beers I chose were the panama red (hoppy red ale), total stealth (IPA), double secret (DIPA) and Springs in the floor (APA).  Out of the bunch I liked the Panama Red the most due to the brightness the hops brought the red ale and then liked the Springs in the floor the least.  For my entree I ordered one of their specials for the day which was the short rib confit taco.  The menu said it was short rib braised in rendered duck fat and their pale ale topped with fire roasted pineapple slaw, hot pepper relish, Romano and Parmesan cheese.  Our food here took quite awhile to get to us.  Our server actually came back and confirmed our order about 10 minutes after we had put in it to begin with and then after a somewhat long wait my wife's food was about 5 minutes behind the rest of the tables.  It didn't bother us as we were busy sharing vacation pictures but they still took care of us without us saying anything about it.  In any case I thought that my tacos were delicious.  The meat was moist and tender while the pineapple added some sweetness and the relish gave it a nice and spicy kick.  For someone like myself it was quite the well conceived dish as it ticked off the savory, sweet and spicy boxes.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Even though the food took quite awhile to get to us I found it to be really good and their beers decent as well.",2018-05-15 12:06:20

It's those damn Greek chairs! lol  When you walk in, you are welcomed with dim lighting and Greek music.  Also, the menu is exactly how it would be in Greece.  

I was beyond hungry coming here, hungry to the point where you feel sick.  So that kinda threw me off and I couldn't truly enjoy my experience. Still, I forced myself to eat. As you may have read in the reviews (and it says right on their menu), they take you to the kitchen to show you the specials of the day.  One of the specials was Fasolakia, which are green beans cooked in tomato sauce, so I had to get a side order of it.  I love it!  I also ended up just getting a single pork skewer and my boyfriend got the chicken souvlaki dinner.

They serve complimentary bread which was really good according to my boyfriend.

No other Greek restaurants, that I have been to in the GTA, do this. It was a good serving.  Enough for two people.  Taste and presentation were on point.

The only complaint from the both of us was the rice.  Nothing special at all, in fact pretty bland.  

Despite feeling so sick on my visit here, I still think the place deserves 4 stars.  I would return here if I was really feigning for Greek food.  Tastes are as authentic as their Greek chairs.  It doesn't get realer than that.",2017-08-02 13:11:08
yh_wawgTdatxQQKfuGazSQ,oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q,4,20,14,20,"Still outstanding.

Seafood, expertly prepared served in a contemporary tree house in the middle of the desert.  It never gets old.   All this from a chain restaurant.

The fish version of a steakhouse.  Large filet cuts of fresh fish, simply seasoned and grilled.  No swimming in sauces, no embellishments on the plate.  Sides, like at a steakhouse are ordered separately and meant to be  shared.

The food; this isn't a sushi restaurant or a steakhouse.  Nuff said.

Classic cold starters from perfectly cooked and chilled jumbo (U8) shrimp, sweet chunks of Dungeness crab leg meat, chunks of just cooked through lobster all served with a zesty cocktail sauce are all excellent.  

For something warm, the sautéed day boat sea scallops, ocean candy.  Perfect sear, mid rare, enhanced with a bit of butter and squeeze of lemon.  Also consider sharing the Vanilla battered lobster (a main).  Sounds weird, but the vanilla imparts an indescribable flavor that heightens the oceanic sweetness of the lobster.  The light tempura style batter provides a hint of textural contrast.

Mains are all about the fish.  The Scottish salmon, simply seasoned and grilled medium is outstanding.  Loaded with creamy fat that carries the unmistakable sweet flavor of salmon.  The flavor goes on and on.  The Crusted Chilean sea bass cooked medium well is equally good.  Large flakes of moist, tender flesh oozing oceanic fattiness.   

Save room for sides.  The lobster mashed potatoes remains excellent.  Seemingly more lobster than potato.  Perfectly cooked, large chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery, mash, whole claws thrown in for good measure.  Sinfully delicious.  The Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi, wow.  50 percent sweet king crab meat, 50 percent pillowy gnocchi in a delicate cream sauce imbued with black truffle oil and bits.  Aggressively seasoned but it works to heighten the umame finish that makes whatever piece of grilled fish accompanying it explode with flavor.

Very good wine program.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

Excellent steakhouse (I know) service.

We got some soup and a Burrito Enchilada Style. Soup was properly warmed and sized and tasted good, to boot. Burrito was HUGE! Did i say HUGE? I never EVER seen gianormous burrito like this in my life, and l love Mexican food and consume quite a bit of it. So... it was HUGE! And tasted real good too.

It's a pretty neat idea but in reality (as a first time visitor) it was quite a confusing experience.

Overall store design was simple and uniform. A few long tables on one side for seating and the line-up lab on the other. I would say the seating was a bit weird - unless you don't mind sharing a table with another group, each table was larger than usual bubble tea places.

When I first entered the shop and lined up for their bubble tea, there were instructional signage and ""tips"" on the wall. However, those tips were confusing if you don't know the process or how the lab flows. Thankfully, the staff there acting as the scientist were there to teach. The staff asked us if we are first timers and if we are, they guided us on our choices eg. Milk base or non-milk base, fruity or not, and then gradually there is a mini cabinet where you can choose the toppings. 

Cute thing is that during the line-up, it reminded me of back when I was still in school getting lunch using a cafeteria tray. And lastly, you get to pick the type of tea going with all the flavours.

I enjoyed the experience but personally, it was about the gimmick than the actual bubble tea. Relative to other places, I found their drinks more expensive. I also always stick to either less sugar or no sugar, but at Labothery you are not able to adjust the sugar levels.",2018-06-13 02:55:23

The food was always good, but we really didn't love it.  However, they have recently revamped their menu and have added a few new dishes, bento boxes, and more Thai selections that we really like.  The Thai is really just ""ok"", so don't get too excited, but the Bento boxes are really good and their new ""Wedding Roll"" is off-the-hook YUMMY!!!  (see picture)  I love fancy sushi rolls and this one hits the mark every time.  It's a Shrimp Tempura roll topped with Tobiko, Spice Tuna and sliced Avocado.  The Shrimp is plump, tender, and fried perfectly, the spicy tuna is fresh and seasoned nicely, and the freshness from the creamy thin sliced avocado balances the roll off perfectly!  The roll comes beautifully presented on a platter drizzled with a creamy spicy sauce and a sweet soy sauce.  Delicious!!  My new favorite Sushi roll in Charlotte.

My son and my Mom always get the Sesame Chicken.  It's really good...if you like Sesame Chicken.  The chicken is crispy and the sauce is thick and tasty.  For the lunch special, it also comes with a delicious eggroll and fried rice (they have very good fried rice...not crunchy or greasy and not overdone with peas and carrots).    We also really like their Crab Rangoons.  Crispy and not oily with the right amount of filling.

My husband typically goes for the Ho Fun, but he's been on a major Thai kick lately and has ordered the Chicken Pad Thai during his last two visits.  He likes it to satisfy his Thai craving when we can't make it over to Thai Taste (the BEST Thai food in Charlotte, in our opinion), but he had to order it with extra spice the second time around because it wasn't spice enough the first time.  He enjoyed it...as a substitute, in a pinch.  :-)

Other items that we have tried and enjoyed are: Lo Mein, Chicken and String Beans, Garlic String Beans, Garlic Broccoli, Beef & Broccoli, and Wonton Soup.

I should also mention that I am very suprised by the number of negative comments regarding service.  We have only eaten in 5-6 times and it's almost always during lunch hours, but we have never had bad service there.  

We really like Kami and we're happy with the new menu.  As long as they keep the current standards of quality and service, we will continue to be fans.   For anyone who like Shrimp Tempura rolls....you must try the Weddington Roll...it's a Shrimp Tempura roll on steroids!",2012-07-06 18:40:49

I typically do rapid order pickup but on occasion go in to order, and typically the service is a bit slow, hence why I order ahead using their app. The staff are generally pleasant enough but yes, they could be friendlier, but I've never experienced anyone be rude to me.  I find the store and bathrooms to be neat and tidy and have never thought that the store was unclean, but again I rarely eat in, so maybe I'm not there long enough to witness this. The food is decent quality even if it is a bit expensive, but I'd choose Panera over fast food any day.  They offer a lot of healthier options than other quick take out places, and they do their best to use natural ingredients and provide nutritional information/calories for each of their items, so that makes eating their convenient and easy if you are tracking your daily intake.  Overall I think they are as good as any other Panera that I've been to, so I plan to keep going back.

Be sure to sign up for Panera's Rewards program - even if you only eat there once or twice a month, you typically can get freebies every couple of months.

I came here with a friend to introduce them to the wondrous world of Kamjatang (Korean pork bone soup). We walked in on a Saturday night and the restaurant was fairly busy. We were seated promptly and our order was taken quickly. I ordered the mushroom kamjatang, my friend ordered the dumpling kamjatang (they have a few varieties of kamjatang; a special variety will run you about .50 cents more than the original). After a short period our food arrived, sadly this kamjatang was not up to snuff, the pork was dry, and the broth lacked any real flavour, it was more watery than anything. I ordered mine spicy and if what was brought to me is what they consider spicy than it is simply laughable, the soup had no kick whatsoever. A proper Kamjatang will have at least a medium level of spice but this one was mild at best. Lastly the portion size was ok but on the small side compared to other places I have been to. The extra .50 cents for mushrooms got me maybe 4 slices of mushroom not much more. In addition to the soup we got some banchan (complimentary side dishes) which consisted of a seaweed salad, kimchi and what I believe was pickled turnip (similar flavour to kimchi) all of these were nothing special. 

The restaurant itself is sad and grim, something more suited to an Orwell novel rather than a plaza in Markham.* The service was attentive and all the waiters spoke great English. When it came time to pay I opted to pay debit, their debit machine is ancient and looks like the first debit machine ever put out on the market. My first attempt at payment the machine froze and I was assured my payment did not go through but lo and behold I checked my bank statement the other day and I see TWO identical charges from this place on the same day.

To start me and my guest decided to try the wine pairings with our courses and split each dish, so we could each try 6 dishes and glasses of wine. Awesome idea..unless you REALLY want to finish a dish because it's great! Haha. And with the food at Jump we ran into that conundrum more than once.
The appetizers were a pumpkin soup and a dinosaur kale and ricotta salad...which I'm not ashamed to say was ordered purely on the basis of having 'dinosaur' in the name, heh. It was tart and delicious with small chunks of fig going nicely with the ricotta and kale. The pumpkin soup was OK, but not really to my taste because of the crab in the soup.
For mains, we had goat cheese stuffed Atlantic salmon and braised beef cheeks on bean ragout. I'd like to talk about the salmon, but it was so good that I barely got any by the time my dinner partner was done with it. Haha. The beef cheeks were well done and the white bean ragout they were on was also tasty.
For dessert I finally had the chance to have the much talked about (thanks Phillip S. lol) traditional bread and butter pudding. It was a large square chunk of dense raisin bread in an amazing caramel sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. This thing is insane: the sauce is incredibly rich and decadent and it all comes together incredibly well. I'd come back here for this alone.

There have been 1 or 2 times where the food came out dry but all other times the meat is juicy and tasty. Usually..atleast in my experience during late night visits... when you come in, you have the choice of either chicken or beef depending on what they have cooking. it's a little bit unfortunate, but luckily both of their meats are great. My personal preference, however, is beef.  

Today, my shawarma turmed out very well as they usually do. The chicken, which can be hard to cook, was definitely not dry. Credit is due to the cook who didn't overcook the meat on the grill. For some, it can be a sketchy area during the night hours but if you don't mind its really not too bad.

4) Very laptop friendly, though most of the slots are only on one wall.

3) Consistently flawless service, and I mean consistently.

2) The washrooms way cleaner than other S-bux locations.

We ordered the new tuna poke for appetizer (this we both really enjoyed; flavored well with just a little spice to it), my husband said in the future he'd order this as his entrée along with a salad and a cup of soup and he'd be happy. It was a fair serving size too for the price (good job on this one). 
We also ordered some of the clam chowder. I may be a bit of a snob being from the Boston area originally, but I thought it was pretty bland with hardly anything but broth; potatoes are cheap and I found 2 small potato pieces in the entire cup not to mention hardly any clams (I'll pass next time). 
For the entrée we got the broiled flounder; this was cooked well but didn't have much flavor either; some butter and herbs would really help this dish (plenty of fish in one serving though, we shared). 
I also ordered the broiled scallops (unfortunately over-cooked). Scallops can be a challenge for many cooks so I won't hold this one against them too much but timing is crucial so you don't end up with a rubbery stump. I ordered a side order of shrimp scampi too; these were good and I ended up pouring the extra sauce over the flounder to boost the flavor. 
Other than the tuna poke, it was just okay.",2018-08-28 21:18:43

The lunch specials are cheap, all under $10 from what I can remember and include soup. 

The portions are decent and the food seems pretty healthy. I did feel like the food lacked some flavor though. My boyfriend got the tikka masala and I forgot what I ordered, but I tried his and it tasted kind of bland.

Tonight's experience wasn't terribly awful, but not much to give more than 3 stars to. First, off the booth they sat us in had a large gash in the bench my dad and I sat on. For some reason, this struck a sour note with me. It was rather huge and hard to miss, I kept thinking, I know I'm not the only person that has or will see this, lets fix it! 

The place had a little bit of crowd going. Good mix of families, couples, and groups of friends grabbing an early dinner, it made for a nice dining atmosphere.

The fam tried out two of the $20 for 3 course meals for two. The service was superb, but the food not so much. I shared chips and salsa, nachos, some mini chicken sandwiches with fries, and key lime pie shots. I didn't finish my sandwiches because they just weren't doing it for me. I ate about 2 of the 3 dessert shots. Still was not impressed... I'm stuffed to the brim at the moment, and somewhat hating myself for eating so much. I would suggest sharing the main courses as well. I know it defeats the purpose, but you shouldn't bother getting your own dish with this deal, its way too much food!

I know it was a family dinner, but I spent half my time watching the Little League game of Japan vs. the Caribbean on one of the tv's, through the small window in the wall separating our dining area from the bar.

The ribs and chicken were excellent. The BBQ sauce was not overpowering tart vinegar taste. The smokey taste hit the palate a few seconds after the sweet sauce taste.

This gem is hidden in the target plaza, just to the right of the Target building. Upon entering this god given place you're immediately greeted by everyone and seated quickly, which is nice. I like getting noticed and eating right away hehe. The decorations are pretty generic same as every other sushi restaurant nothing special. As for wait times my friend and I came in at 8 and were seated immediately. If you're just coming with two people just seat at the bar its so much better trust me! When you order some rolls the chef can just immediately hand it to you instead of waiting for a server to bring it over. We left around 9:30 and the place started to get popping, so wait times can be not steady.

The servers here are so nice and on top of it!!! They would always ask if I was okay, if I wanted any more appetizers and rolls. The guy who was making my sushi (sai) was no exception to this too. He treated us very well, and made our sushi quickly after we ordered. 

Soooo lets start with the appetizers! What a breathe of fish air seeing new food at ayce sushi! We got some staples first; shrimp tempura, pork belly, and edamame. The shrimp tempura was lacking in flavor to be honest. The pork belly on the other hand is so goddamn good, so freaking fatty jkasdl;fj;ksdaasd;kj yum. 

Moving on to their different types of appetizers the Bul-go-gi nacho! What a presentation masterpiece! It comes with in four nacho typa things with some fish and other spices on top. Definitely would order again. The japanese nacho on the other hand wasn't to my liking. I was a fan of the beef on top but not so much of the sauce they juiced it with it was a bit too much. Oh btw unlimited mochii hehehe. Their coffee mochi is really strong though so beware!

For sushi I feel like this places thrives more on presentation than most other ayce sushi. Every roll that comes out are all instagram worthy. And all were 10/10. We ordered tons of sushi so I can't go through every one we ordered. They were all exceptional. But the two that were the best was the jackpot roll and special white tuna. The jackpot roll is decorated with a bunch of sprinkles so it looks like a cereal but do not underestimate it's greatness. Do your taste buds a favor and introduce them to something out of this world :)

PRO TIP! If you're just coming with TWO PEOPLE SEAT AT THE BAR its so much better trust me! AND GET THE SASHIMI SALAD!!!!!

In 1869, freshly returned from his reverse trip on the Oregon Trail, Erasmus Jebediah Aiello came to Pittsburgh only to find his arch nemesis/famous actor Sal Mineo had taken up residence in the middle of a giant hill.  Sal Mineo proceeded to whip an apple with amazing force hitting Erasmus right in his junk.  This made Sal Mineo laugh, and Erasmus, understandably, cry.  Swearing revenge, Erasmus used the skills he had learned from a mystical tribe of Native Americans and made a deal with the chief of the squirrels (his name was Benjamin) to fight Sal Mineo.  With the deal struck, the squirrels attacked Sal Mineo with all of their fury, and after an epic struggle, managed to kill him in 1976.  The crime was pinned on a drifter.  And since that day, the area surrounding the massacre has been known as ""Squirrel Hill.""

After that, their ancestors coincidentally both opened pizza places on Murray Avenue, which was named after Bill Murray after he beat a steam driving machine in a race.

But I digress.

This place is unbelievable, and I am so glad that my wife introduced me to it.  If it's not the best pizza I have ever had in the area, it is at least in the top 3.  Either by the slice, or one of their specialty pizzas, I have never been disappointed.

On a personal note: Children of Erasmus (fun fact: that's what all the people that work at Aiello's like to be called), get a fucking credit card machine.  You officially do enough business to make it a convenience to your customers.",2012-04-17 23:17:15

I'll state the pros and cons from our point of view. When renting, I always keep in mind that this is a business and property managers are pretty much middle men. With that being said, McKenna did a great job addressing property issues. Maintenance request were addressed promptly and there was always communication. I only had one small issue when the A/C went out in the middle of the Summer (during the weekend) and McKenna utilized a third party to address calls. They were awful, but Ms. McKenna herself returned an email with concerns and addressed everything professionally.

The maintenance people who would come out were always professional and I really don't have anything negative regarding the management side of the property. The Cons are pretty much on the financial side. The rent did go up every year and there is a fee associated with each lease renewal. If you mess up on EFT/Online payments (no matter the cause) be prepared for a huge headache. They will not allow you to pay online at all, even if it's a Visa/MasterCard. You have to physically drive to the office and drop off a money order or cashiers check for a total of 6 consecutive months. They don't accept cash or checks during those months either. 

So there is no other option to pay rent for people who are constantly on the move (like myself). That was a nightmare for me and the front secretary had a horrible attitude. Last and final thing is the mighty deposit. After almost 4 years and normal wear/tear, we moved into a bigger home. I was not expecting my full deposit at all but there were some questionable items. We had our own washer and when we moved, we asked our handy man to place the property washer back in its place. They charged me $25 to connect the hose. A garage remote was $95 and they did charge to repaint the inside of the house. I've never had a property manager charge me as a tenant to repaint the walls, especially when no wall was damaged.

Overall, I didn't have a negative experience. Just hope they take into consideration certain things.",2017-11-01 20:21:11

The side of chilies really hit the spot too. It is nice that the food tastes consistent and just like I remember from eating at Tommy's when I lived in southern California.

I had family in town this weekend for Thanksgiving, and brought a party of 10 to Eggworks at 9am on Sunday morning.  I called in ahead of time and they were gracious enough to take a reservation, even though that's outside the norm for them.

Two of us in the party are Vegan (my husband and I).  We knew the menu, and knew we would need to modify dishes to meet our dietary needs, but I was disappointed w/ the lack of accommodation the restaurant provided.  We each ordered the Veggie Skillet, no cheese, no eggs and asked if we could get avocado instead.  We were told we would need to pay extra for the avocado.  I reminded the waitress that per their menu, a side of avocado costs more than a side of eggs and cheese (arguably the most expensive parts of the dish) and she advised there was nothing she could do.

Had it just been the two of us, we probably would have walked out instead of paying $15.00 each for a dish of veggies and potatoes, but we had 8 other people with us so we bit our tongues, and paid for the extra avocado.  The meal was tasty, but that's besides the point.  In addition, they offer no non-dairy milk for their coffee, so we had to pass on that as well (non-dairy creamer still has milk products in it).  Come on, most breakfast and coffee houses around town at least have an almond or soy milk option.

The vegan community in Vegas is only getting stronger, if a restaurant isn't going to have vegan options on the menu, they should be accommodating of the vegans that do still frequent the restaurant.

I e-mailed the restaurant that morning, it is now two days later and I haven't heard a peep, hence why I decided to write this review.  The next time I have a large party like this, I will take them to many of the other restaurants in town, where we can all be accommodated.",2015-12-01 23:29:13

It's an adorable set up. There's an outdoor patio when the weather is nice and the building is two floors. It's dark and cozy with art on the walls. 

Service is always spectacular. The servers are helpful, friendly and take great care of their customers.

Their hummus is AMAZING!!! It's super tasty and it's my favorite hummus from any restaurant. Their platter comes with tons of veggies and pita bread. The Britney Spears chicken tenders are awesome- their sauces are unique and packed with flavor. Why did I call them Britney Spears chicken tenders you ask? Because their menu is awesome and witty and hilarious- their items have really goofy names with long descriptions that make you laugh. 

Today I ordered their grilled weasel which is a veggie sandwich. I've had it in the past and it's perfect every time. Ciabatta bread, portabella mushroom cap, grilled zucchini,  red peppers, melty cheese... So good! Their eggplant parm is awesome too! Sooo yummy! 

Harris grill is consistently good. Is it the most amazing meal you have ever had? Well no, I mean maybe .. .. But overall it's always good. They always have living socials and groupons too!",2014-12-27 02:59:45

vDO62Rm8YAXX_gIWdCBmzA,WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,3,7,5,6,"I liked Five50 Pizza Bar. So much, in fact, that I ended up coming twice in the course of one night at the Aria. It was an easy, comfortable spot for dinner as well as for drinks and dessert after some time on the casino floor. The only problem with Five50 Pizza Bar was that the pizza was no good.

We came for an early Sunday dinner after driving in from LA with no particular plans. We were thinking about leaving the Aria, which is where we were staying, but inertia got the best of us when we stumbled across a pizza place right by the sports betting station. It was only 5:30, but we were hungry after our time on the road, and the restaurant was beautifully empty.

I liked the vibe of the place. Very much of one piece with the Aria, ritzy and modern with high ceilings and interesting decor, but casual and fuss-free. There was a large bar that ended up being half the point of the place, and service was solid. We ended up coming back with a couple more friends when we needed a place to catch up later in the night. We brought our leftover pizza for them to eat, and our server didn't call us out for having the take-out box on the table.

That pizza, though, was some of the worst I've had in a while--no contest when measured against others in its price range. These were expensive personal pies, and they just didn't taste good. They were flawed on a basic level, limp and greasy with way too much cheese. The toppings were good, at least. The Catania came with white sauce, garlic purée, Italian sausage, rapini, and roasted tomato; the Forager with white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta, and spinach. Pretty good ideas, but not enough to redeem the pizzas.

Weirdly, everything else was great. The beet salad was excellent, a colorful mix of local beets with watercress, farro, pumpkinseed vinaigrette, and grissini. One of my friends doesn't like burrata, so we got it with goat cheese--accommodating kitchen, and a nice substitution. When we came back after dinner, I had some kind of craft beer on tap (I forget which, but it was a good one), and partook in a couple of decadent milkshakes. The Vegas root beer float was a satisfying shake loaded with vanilla ice cream, caramel, Butterfinger crumbles, and Boylan's root beer. The mint chocolate swirl mixed mint ice cream with chocolate syrup and chocolate mint cookies--what's not to like there? All shakes were available in adult iterations, but the beer was good enough for me.

I enjoyed Five50 Pizza Bar despite its failure to deliver good pizza. I'd recommend it for an easy drink or meal if you're hanging out at the Aria. I wouldn't hesitate to go back; I just might avoid the signature offerings.",2017-01-10 20:41:12

Sakana wasn't too big of a restaurant, but it was spacious enough and not too crowded mid-afternoon when I visited. The interior decoration felt very sea-themed to me, and after all, ""sakana"" does mean ""fish"" in Japanese. 

I opted for the AYCE dinner (dinner is anything after 3PM). The price is reasonable (~$26 before tax), and includes everything on the menu. Some of the more premium items are only available to order as part of AYCE for dinner, and are limited to one order. I also found out when I received my bill that drinks are NOT included (had I known, I would not have ordered both hot tea and lemonade). 

Service was efficient and generally friendly. When one of my orders arrived as a roll instead of a hand roll, they remedied the situation without giving me a hard time. They are also very observant and quick to clear finished plates, since all the servers work as a team (I may have had a primary waiter/waitress, but placed orders with multiple people and had sushi brought out by different people as well).

The food was pretty decent for AYCE sushi, and there were definitely some unique items on the menu too. In particular, some of the nigiri cuts were quite big portions of fish, and the rice ball underneath is relatively small. The food came out relatively quickly as well. 

There were some Korean dishes on the menu, and Kpop playing on the TVs, so I would safely assume that this restaurant is Korean-owned. Several of the servers and even a few sushi chefs were Latino, so it's a very multicultural staff, haha.

I was struggling at the very end to finish the last few pieces of two rolls, as they charge for leftovers. I was able to finish in the end, though didn't ask if they offer half-sized portions for rolls.

Decent variety of dishes + reasonable price + above average quality = solid AYCE sushi. You can also order a-la-carte if you desire, though if you are hungry, AYCE is definitely much better value.",2016-12-13 05:32:23

The location is great, in the heart of Uptown.",2015-01-11 03:02:28

I've been dying to try Chicago Joe's which is located downtown in a small house off 4th street. Hey have minimal parking in the back of the house but you also have paid parking across the street. As soon as I walked in the door and table almost meet. It's very little and the tables are very close together. Luckily it wasn't too busy around 3p and we had the lunch menu. The decor in the house was old and had lots of Christmas lights. We started off with bread and butter and it was so fresh and delicious i was very surprised. We also got cheese bread but I thought it was on the too much garlic side. For the entree I opted for their lunch special with shrimp and lobster pasta mixed in with basil. The dish was absolutely amazing and had a lemon zing to it. The dish itself was an appropriate size but it could've been bigger! I asked for another basket of bread to dip in my pasta sauce which was also tasty! The service was good so I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu.,2017-07-14 04:38:11

I was surprised that they had one of my favorite oysters - Kumamoto (from Japan). The Kumamoto oysters are small (smaller than blue point), mild flavor, very smooth with a bit of sweetness! Yum!

For entrees, I had the Lemon Sole (a bit of creamy but flavorful, very soft) with a side of Scallops (over on a creamy tomato and basil sauce, so good!!) And mom had the Petite Fillet (very tender and juicy even it's cooked in well-done)..

I love their bread basket! They were maybe 5? different kinds of bread, and my fav is the pretzel bread!

Service was excellent! It was a busy Wednesday night, but was able to get a reservation two hours before our arrival...There were many 'business-expense' tables; the decor is upscale, but i thought they were kinda tight...

It's definitely a great place for some fresh raw oysters and other seafood! Hmm, may just wanna come back for those delicious oysters!",2010-12-16 03:11:03

I had the beef shawarma.  It was like brisket with a middle eastern sauce wrapped into a pita.  Awesome.  The only problem was that it was really, really messy.  the sauce leaked all over the place.  Napkins are a must.  My friend had gyro.  I took a small bite of the meat.  It may have been the best gyro ever!  I'll have to give a full one a try for myself someday.  The several types of baklava are delightful treat.  We went with cashew, pecan, and walnut.  All three were wonderful.

One big negative.  Only two pieces of pita came with our order of hummus.  Not even close to enough.  Make sure to order an extra (or two).  The hummus, like everything else, is fantastic.  The pita is pretty good, but nothing special by itself.

That being said, authentic doesn't mean it's better.  To be honest I like the pho from those chain pho restaurants better, but those pho places are the equivalent of McDonald's for ""white food"": they taste good, but they aren't authentic.

The pho and noodle soup dishes at MiMi's taste a lot more like what my mom's pho and noodle soup dishes taste like.

What I go to MiMi's for, and what it is known for are their BBQ vermecelli dishes!  Their vermecelli noodle with their BBQ beef, beef balls, Vietnamese sausages, shrimp/seafood wrapped around sugar cane with the fish sauce - that's the stuff!  It's fantastic!  If you go to MiMi's, I would strongly recommend their Vermecelli dishes.

I also eat their rice dishes, they're good too.  And yes, there seem to be a lot of white people in this restaurant for some reason... but I think that's because it's a slightly nicer looking pho place and the waitress there is really friendly and speaks English fluently (as well as Chinese and Vietnamese) - which is impressive!",2010-02-01 06:26:15

Whether you are looking for a gentle stroll or a grueling all day adventure, this is your launch point. A couple of friendly tips to visitors or those who are not regulars in this type of terrain:

1.  Bring water. Bring double what you think you will need. Dehydration happens and it's no joke. 
2. Dress accordingly. Wear proper footwear that can protect you from sharp rocks that will cut right through your flips. The sun gets hot and can burn you all year round. 
3. Respect the environment. Don't be an idiot and leave trash or go off trail. You will screw up someone else's experience, let alone a natural wonder. 
4. Etiquette. Some of us run the trails. Stay to the right if someone is trying to pass. You are welcome to crank your music but please use ear buds. People are friendly and will say hello. They are sincere. It's ok to respond.  The locals don't bite. 
5.  Breathe. It's ok to stop and take in the scenery and enjoy a zen moment. No one will brand you as a tree hugger.",2016-12-11 23:47:59

Blue Hound definitely blew my taste buds out of the water last night. From the pork belly sliders, to the seafood chowder I ordered to go, and certainly not last the decedent pineapple upside down cake, I was in foodie heaven. 

The sliders were topped with a crisp kimchi that paired marvelously with the tender pork belly. There were two somewhat smallish portions. I ate one and set the other aside to finish later that night. Because the principle reason I chose BH was the dessert, I asked for my second course to be boxed. I sampled the chowda at home later in the evening and it was wicked good: the ghost chile, which on the scoville scale it 10 degrees from being an A-bomb in your mouth (and, presumably, another fire a bit lower) brought an amazing heat balance with the subtle bacon and prominent mussels and clams. I'm not sure how this is served in the restaurant, but for the to-go you get a box of the clams and mussels. On to dessert. Simply wonderful! The salted caramel sauce is something I'd love to have a bottle of at home. It's decadent to the nth degree. It's the one sweet treat that I would give up sex for. It's *that* good.

At $40, this was an incredible value. Honestly, I think two people could easily share this meal and be pleasantly sated.

They have valet but we opted for street parking about a 30 second walk away and paid like $1.50. Score.  It's located in the lobby inside the Hilton Garden Inn so in order to get there you will need to enter through the hotels entrance.  
Service was great.  Everyone was accommodating, efficient, friendly and our server was wonderfully patient as it took my friend and I a good 20 minutes just to order our drinks. Sorry dude, we're girls and we need to get all of our talking out before we stuff our faces. 

The menu consisted of standard lunch options: pizza, bruschetta, salads, sandwiches, etc.  We decided to order the caprese bruschetta as well as the fig and share the two.  The caprese was fine.  Nothing spectacular but it got the job done.  The fig however was outstanding.  It was made up of fig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and asparagus.  It was like a slightly more savory version of my favorite prosciutto and brie sandwich from Postino.  I thought the asparagus wouldn't bled well with the other toppings but it provided a nice contrast of flavor and crunch.

We ordered a papaya salad, pad Thai, pad see ew, and beef jerky. The papaya salad had all the flavors I love - fish sauce, lime, chili, etc. and had just the slightest bit of a kick to it. It paired really well with the beef jerky, which was a mix of sweet and salty with just the right amount of chewiness. Both dipping sauces for the beef jerky were good, too. The pad see ew was one of the best I've ever had. The beef was tender, the broccoli still had some crunch, noodles were nice and chewy like they should be and the sauce had a nice balance of the sweet and salty, too. The pad Thai was delicious. The sauce was tangy and flavorful and there was plenty of it so the noodles weren't dry. A must order!

The place was pretty stuffy inside and the smell of the chili's cooking made its way out to the dining area, which made a few folks (and staff) cough a bit. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Would come back again.",2018-06-26 07:07:40

(+) Great facilities and equipment. They cram a lot of stuff in a relatively small space. Plenty of weights and machines! The layout isn't necessarily the best, but everything you need to get in  great workout is there.
(+) They have a ""Cardio Theater"" where some cardio equipment is set up in front of a large screen playing a movie. I've only done this once so far, but it was different and I liked it! I ended up running for longer than I usually do while burning a shit ton of calories while watching ""Batman Begins"". lol  Very unique feature. Plus they keep it so dark in there I had to use the light from my cell phone to program the treadmill!

(-) As practically all the other reviews are stating, it is just crazy busy in here more often than not. Like shit balls crazy busy. Some days it takes much longer to get a workout in due to working in or trying to find a piece of equipment that fits in what you are doing for the day. Easily the biggest knock on this place, If you can go late at night, it is much, much better. Unfortunately, like most people, it works in my schedule better for daytime to workout.
(-) $20 down and $20 a month for this place is a great deal, but that $40 fee to ""keep the rates low"" is pretty weak. Seems like most gyms now a days are charging some kind of ""maintenance fee"" of some sort and just calling it by different names. At least it's just a once a year deal.

(..) Haven't tried any of the wet facilities yet, so I can't speak to those. I can say that the bathrooms look reasonably clean for a place that has the volume of foot traffic this place does.

After my last gym (PF), being at this place is like a huge breath of fresh air! I do like it and plan on being here for a while! I just wish the crowds would let up a bit and this place would be damn near perfect!

I would recommend based on my experience that you should be visiting bimonthly if you enjoy seeing different flowers bloom throughout the season. Also if you're someone who likes or loves or knows someone who loves photography, great date spot, but I mean depending how into photography you or your date are than there might not be a whole lot of interaction between you two but maybe some admiration of another's passions. 

The garden is sectioned off into different areas that house their corresponding plants. They have an open area that gets cooler where they put what seems to be more seasonal flowers and right now they seems to be daffodils but don't quote me on that I just appreciate them and don't really know their names. 

They have a more arid sections that houses cacti and succulents. They also have a more tropical humid area that houses more flowers of unknown name and origin (I mean they're named in Latin on these little plaques but ) I mean like I said I appreciate flowers but in so much that I like the look and smell and then I move on to the next one. 

The walkways here are slightly wide enough for two people to pass by each other but sometime not so much. There isn't really a person there to ask questions so its really a self-directed experience. You can go through the whole garden in about 30 mins if you want or if you enjoy taking photos about 1-1.5 hours. 

Overall I think this place is really accessible, it's free, and it offers you almost an abundance of flowers to look at but it doesn't cost you a ton or time nor make you walk a great distance. If you're looking for a more informative experience this is not for you. Also the second visit we came and we able to purchase some plants and succulents as part of an annual plant sale. They also informed us that they have partnership programs with schools where the plants will be planted at partnered schools.",2018-05-12 22:22:51

I was really eager to try the crab wontons as I saw that it was made with real crab. Sure enough it was as delish as other Yelpers had said it was and I even told my husband he HAD to try it. The consensus in our household was that it was pretty great. The pork pad see ew was good but I'm a carbs person. The pork to noodle ratio was about 2:1 so I felt like I was eating a lot of meat. Overall the flavor was good I just didn't like the overbearing meat but if you are a meat eater than this is definitely for you. I have to say I felt like I did get my money's worth in regards to both items. 

The next day I wanted to try the BBQ pork noodles. It's BBQ pork noodle soup and I really really really enjoyed the pork. It was tender and there was plenty (which in this case I appreciated). Yes, I know I'm picky but I felt that the pork to egg noodle ratio was just perfect. I also ordered the spicy basil pork. Now that dish was just ok...definitely not my favorite place to order it from as I missed the cucumbers that do come with it at other Thai places. Overall, I def enjoyed this place. They do get busy though because the second night even though we ordered it at 7:30 pm it still was a 20-30 minute pick up time. They deliver too if you really need some Thai food.",2016-01-09 06:04:06

I've been here in my pre-yelp days and never had a bad word to say about the place. Sadly, my last experience wasn't up to par.

The atmosphere here is lovely and our server was nothing but pleasant. I started with a cup of the French onion soup and my friend had a salad - no complaints on either.

I was actually looking for a rib eye, but since there wasn't one on the menu, I went with Steak Frites. A pan-seared 9 oz. flat iron, caramelized shallots & maître d'hôtel butter served with French fries. When it arrived, it looked and smelled wonderful, but upon first bite I could immediately tell something was wrong.

There was a very strong and very unpleasant metallic after taste to that first bite. My friend gave me a bite of his NY strip and it tasted the way steak was supposed to. Then I thought maybe the butter or shallots had burned and that's why my bite was off. So I scraped everything off the piece of meat and went in for another bite. Same story. Odd, off-putting taste all over again. I hate to use the word ""rancid"", but well, that's what it tasted like.

The waiter came to check on us and I ended up sending the steak back. As my waistline will attest, I have never sent anything back in my entire life. The waiter was very nice, though I think he may be new as he was a bit flustered and nervous. I was glancing at the menu to see if there was anything else I wanted to try and though he was trying to be helpful the waiter offering to wait for me while I selected another entree felt a little pressured. I hurriedly ordered the salmon and while it came out fast and was tasty, it wasn't really what I wanted.

I was surprised and disappointed by the experience here. I know this place can be great, but with such a huge variety of fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas, I think I'll have to move on from Bouchon.",2013-12-16 19:28:29

For my friends birthday I pretty much took her to the Dyke march and she was like woah! She probably wont be my friend after this haha :) Church street was packed and a lot of gayness was up in di air. We were surprised one time after another, from seeing topless half naked women to gay men fighting with their lovers to stop staring at other men. I saw many straight people like myself just casually roaming around to see what this event was all about. This was probably the first time, I've been hit on by so many women and they weren't bad looking at all, honestly I laughed a lot just because this was totally different experience for me. l felt surrounded by people who were positive and aloof and didn't care to be judged and thats how I felt I could relate to the gay community.  My favourite part was discovering these little booths that sold art, music, accessories of all sorts and my friend and I grabbed the cutest bracelets for 2 for $25. After seeing sexy stage performances and watching men doing cart wheels in zebra g-strings, I needed a drink because this was just getting crazy. There were many bars and restaurants, with line ups out the door and on to the street and yet people were still smiling and mingling with one another.

I tried their prix fixe menu for Restaurant Week and got the Mahi mahi. It was a little too sweet for me - too much vinaigrette type sauce... added some lemon and it was good to go. I tried my friend's filet mignon and that was definitely good.

The peanut butter pie was like a giant reese's peanut butter cup. It was good for the first few bites but definitely too much for a full dessert. 

The service was a bit slow and probably was due to the dinner rush. I don't know if it'd be a good place to come when you're super hungry. Seating was ample though. 

Definitely worth another visit.

* update *
Just returned for a second run of their Restaurant Week deal. What I said before stands. Food tends to run a little sweet and salty. The chicken lollipop was good BUT REALLLLLY sweet/overpowered by the sauce. The filet mignon was well seasoned, but a little on the salty side. 

The food is pretty solid... and you can't really go wrong. The service this time was superb and on point. Overall win in my book.",2017-06-23 05:12:34

Pluses - The service is fast and friendly and the fact that it's (slightly) cheaper than Oyshi, whose prices reflect more of a sit-down place anyways.
 
Cons - It's just not anywhere near as good. The miso soup was loaded with way too much seaweed, some weird things that I picked out and assumed were little mushrooms (I hate mushrooms) and not enough miso-y goodness; that is to say it was a tad watery. The Vegetarian futomaki was fairly blah with some odd choices (red pepper? really?) in the roll. 

As a vegetarian I'm aware that my sample size is admittedly small but I can certainly compare to what I've had elsewhere. If Kokoro were the only sushi place within walking distance to my office I might consider it again. All things being equal though I think next time I'll just make sure to call ahead when ordering at Oyshi.",2014-04-04 19:38:23

The concept and the space is great but it isn't really well executed. Food is ok and the service is scattered. Portions are quite small (even for the price). 

The high point of the night were drinks. I had a great white wine sangria and the Sapporo beer comes in massive steins. 

We ordered a selection of skewers (some beef, pork, scallops, shrimp) to share (we were with friends but we shared in our couple). Shrimp was small and tasteless. The scallop was decent but certainly nothing special. Our beef dishes were also ok but uninspired. Tacos were boring. We had a bun sandwich thing (two different ones) that were also not very interesting. The meatball stuffed with cheese was ok but nothing that special. To be honest, there wasn't one standout dish.

Service was all over the place. I sat all night with an empty glass, hoping to catch the waitress to order another and food sort of got dumped on the table before they skittered away. It was also paced strangely - five or six dishes would come out at once and then nothing but a single skewer here and there for the next little while.

It's a Sunday afternoon date, which was nice because the weekend was action packed for me, so a lunch date was just right. He picked the place, I do like that when the man picks the place and he even scores big points with me because it wasn't a chain restaurant, not that he would know that I'm on this only eating at local places & Yelp about it mission this year lol. 

I didn't ask him where we were headed but was pleasantly surprised because we were at the Cofco Chinese Cultural Center, never been and have always wanted to go check out, was kinda disappointed in how small it was. Walked around and checked out a few things still wasn't sure of the reason we were here, then we walked into Szechwan Palace and I thought gosh this is cute little place.

From the time we walked in I got the feeling he was a regular their and wondered how many of his dates he brought here LOL The ladies were happy to see him and were talking with him, I of course had no clue what was being said cuz they all were talking in Chinese.  

Got to our table, had a very hard time trying to figure out what I wanted to try, I found lots of dishes that I wanted, he order chicken fried rice, I would up ordering mongolian beef extra spicy. Order came out and it smelled delish, and being a crazy obsessed yelper that I am I picked up my phone, turned the plate around to the best view and started to take pictures of the dish, date looked at me funny but didn't ask, guess his other dates don't take pics of their food LOL I could see the coating of the red chili oil on the beef and onions, the beef was tender and onions and peppers were perfect, only thing it was missing the heat of the spice. But I finished the entire dish, it was that good!  Next time I want to try beef with jalapeno, I bet that dish packs some heat!

 I look forward to coming back and trying out more of their menu, glad to have finally made it over to the cultural center! Food was delish, date went well, and it was a good day.

The food ranged from very good to phenomenal.  Way more than we were expecting from a simple-looking place with a basic BBQ/American menu.  My wife decided to try the fish tacos, which she normally doesn't because she doesn't like spicy food at all and some places over-spice them.  They were made from huge chunks of fish, very crispy on the outside, tender inside, with a really great light sauce.  One of the best fish tacos anywhere.

The BBQ platter was excellent.  The pork not only shredded easily with a fork, it was almost the consistency of butter to chew on.  The brisket was some of the most tender I've had.  The BBQ sauce was really good.  Links weren't extraordinary, but still very good.

Hubby always gets the three pigs skillet, which I think they recently renamed but he loves it and there is never anything left on the plate. 

Price wise, it is very reasonable for Vegas. We always get out of there for less that $30, (20% tip included) which I feel is a good value for that kind of breakfast.

We started off with the charity bread with three cheeses. It's so nice that they are selling items for a good cause! The bread was delicious, a little fatty for my part but still the flavour was top notch! As a main I opted for the baked pasta carbonara. My friend had a pasta with tomato sauce and spicy cheese. Unfortunately, the pasta carbonara was not much to cheer for. It tasted bland, which makes me believe they are not using these delicious aged cheeses that a proper carbonara should contain. Additionally, there was not much pancetta in it, I had to really dig around to find the few pieces. My friend on the other hand said the food was delicious.  
The food was very filling so we asked our waitress to pack the leftovers for us. I tried convincing my friend she should have a sweet ending of her meal, afterall it was her birthday but she was too full so we instead asked for the bill. To our surprise, with the bill came a chocolate jar cake for the birthday girl, which was a very nice surprise. Apparently they do this for your birthday. We thanked our kind waitress and decided to try sharing this dessert. 
To summarise, I have been to this restaurant before and I've enjoyed both their pizza and pasta so I will probably come back again, however I will not order the carbonara. The waitress was friendly and service oriented, so a big shout out to her (Federica? Sorry don't know your name)! 3 stars for the food but overall 4 stars for the whole experience.",2017-05-17 16:27:46

Considering the fact that your previous choices for getting Afghan style kabobs consisted of (the amazing) Bamiyan and not much else, the fact this place opened up shop right downtown is more than a little awesome. The place has a little bit of a fast-food lunch time restaurant vibe. (It's very clean and very bright.) I've been a few times now, and it's been great each time. The food is very tasty, and the portions are gigantic. It's a tiny bit pricier than some of the other lunch options in the area, but not by much. If you go, get the Chaplee, which is a little bit spicy and a little bit wonderful. Also get the Bolanee. (You should always get Bolanee when you go to an Afghan restaurant.

I never complain, but I do usually suggest we go to this one because, like so many events in life, coffee makes it so much more tolerable.

For being an in-store location, this Starbucks rules!  For one thing it looks like a full service Starbucks that was designed as such, not a target snack bar counter with a mermaid logo added. And unlike so many in-stores, this one has a card reader so I can scan my phone app. Can't think of anything more annoying than going to a Starbucks that won't accept my Starbucks money.

Also, they'll ask you how spicy you'd like your food on a scale of 1-10;  I love spicy food and consider myself to have a slightly above average tolerance to spice, and I find 7 is my sweet spot for something that's hot but doesn't overpower the dish for me.",2017-11-11 16:28:46

So I feel a need to be psych, to play ""Frogger"" with the cars.  Getting into my car and driving three hundred yards doesn't seem to make any sense given the dearth of parking here. 

We like to come to the Quarter because of the HH at Brio and shopping at Pottery Barn. West Elm is an interesting twist on the same concept and I like to window shop inside the Apple store. Our family usually heads to H&M and Sephora next door, while I'm at my electronic toy store. 

We've hit a few of the restaurants. Coal Burger is now gone, but it was okay. The pizza is very good at Girmaldi's and the yogurt place on the corner is also good. The MiniBar-ber wasn't bad either and they give you a nice hair cut.

The Jajangmyeon (Chinese-style wheat noodles in stir-fried black bean sauce) is still a must and one of my favorite Korean dishes! Last night, the noodles were slightly overcooked and seemed different from the first two times I've had it, but the sauce was on point. It's also just $8.95.

After feeling like the Hawaiian eats were a bust, I ordered the Kalua Pork and Cabbage ($12.95) the last two times and it is delicious! It's one of my favorite Hawaiian dishes, so it has my stamp of approval. The sticky white rice and macaroni salad were good too.

Not surprisingly, the Banchan didn't impress me. I didn't like their kimchi at all and there wasn't anything else memorable. However, we love the complimentary boiled peanuts (another Hawaii ""pupu"" staple)!

Service is wonderful and everything is so quick, which is very good because it gets busy! We were there for dinner on Saturday night around 7:30pm and although there was no wait, the tables were full.

Finally, it was the barista who was making a drink who acknowledged me.  It was very strange as in most locations, they say ""Hi"" and want to take your order ASAP!

After I order my drink, I waited some more, until the slightly more experienced one said they were out of Blonde and had to wait for it for them to make more.  Ummm...ok.  Then she said the machine was broken, spoke to some kinda manager, and offered to make me any other drink off the menu in Venti + whatever bakery item I wanted.

That alone is my number one recommendation! However, since I have had it twice I decided to try something different. So I asked the lady about some of the new items they had. One was called Clafoutis which is made out of bread pudding and stuffed with cherries. The other was lime Bavarian cream with raspberry. I ordered both since they told me I could store the Clafoutis in my refrigerator for one day.

They served my lime Bavarian cream on an actual plate with a fork. They also have a few tables where you can sit and eat. Again, they offer sandwiches as well as coffee or tea. You can also order cakes or pastries in advance. The staff was very helpful and explained everything to me.

That new lime Bavarian cream was delicious and not overly filling which was perfect for me!  I plan on eating the Clafoutis later but I'm sure since they recommended it to me, I know I won't be disappointed. When I had finished eating my dessert I placed it to the left of the cash register which I was told was fine so they could take it away.

This place is easy to miss while you are driving down Butler St but again the place fills up very quickly since it is a popular place for sandwiches and French pastries.

MJaRwm3AKC1GOZJpXiwlPQ,MtV1QuQNILQefwWVK-Q-zA,Hc7tNpMVe-SIsLaUbNvtTw,4,0,0,0,"my friends and i went to Kultura's winterlicious to celebrate my friend's birthday. I didn't like how they asked for a CC number when we're just making reservations, it makes customers nervous and unsure if they really want to eat there. 

service: my waitress (sadly did not get her name) was very polite and thanked us for coming to celebrate my friends birthday ( i never had a server that thanked me). They offered a free dessert to the bday girl besides the dessert that came with the prix fix but there were no other dessert selections besides the winterlicious desserts. When it got busy the service slowed down, if its during winterlicious then wouldn't you hire more ppl? i didn't like having finished plates infront of me for 15mins after each course.

decor/ atmosphere: i loved the decor and ambiance. it was really nice and i was so glad that they weren't blasting out music and having everyone shout across the table.

food: appetizers: the Dungeness Crab Naan had a huge portion compared to the others, but overall the apps were nothing special. however, i did like the Chai Tea Glaze that came with the chicken samosas. IMO the sea bass was the best entree, it was so juicy and buttery. The flank steak was cooked medium rare, and they didn't even ask my friend how she wanted it. There were high reviews for the Mushroom Orecchiette but my friends said that it could've been better. I wasn't too excited about the dessert selection, no one ordered the doughnuts because we read that tim hortants made better timbits so we ordered the cheesecake and creme brulee. The cheesecake tasted like pure butter. The creme brulee tasted different..maybe because it was almond flavor? i just couldn't put my finger on it. 

overall, the experience was good.",2014-01-11 22:44:00

When we arrived we seated ourselves. I don't believe anyone noticed us until 5 minutes later and brought our menus. They have a lot of specials of the days and drink specials but it wasn't anything appealing. My friend and I settled for fish and chips and pulled pork tacos. My friend had no complaints about her fish but it wasn't anything special for the expensive price. I've had better and cheaper fish and chips. My tacos actually didn't even taste warm. The meat tasted like room temperature. Maybe my tacos are meant to be like that? Not sure. 

The decor is a little dated. If you're not looking for anything fancy and just grabbing a pint I would come here. The drinks you can't go wrong but I wouldn't order food here. Service was okay at best. Maybe just an off night?",2016-01-10 03:01:30

9o9YH-crIN2SPRIur_BaLw,Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,ijveoy_NiSAmnSOqKCFkAA,5,3,0,0,"I've now used this shop for two shellac manis and a deluxe pedi. So far, this venue is a total thumbs-up. Vegas Voyager-approved!

I've patronized this shop a bit (after consulting with the firm of Google&Yelp), not because I was unhappy with LaBelle, but because it's pretty clear I am going to have make appointments at LaBelle (to get my preferred tech) ... and my nature is just that I am not very diligent when it comes to scheduling hair & nails. This shop, even though it is busy, seems to be able to take walk-ins pretty quickly. As of this writing, I figure to mix it up a bit, using both shops.

My recent pedi was awesome. The core service, no neg issues at all. I gave the tech instructions to avoid a certain callus - and she did so; no communication gaps here so far. Copious amounts of lavender scrub & rub were used. The massage during the pedi was as extensive as any I've had anywhere. Up to the knee-caps, no less! A lot of it was spot-on reflexology. This was a full 90 minutes of excellent service ... and at a price of only $38 before tip.

Another thing I liked about my pedi ... and something that's not true at a lot of shops ... the pedi station and its controls were perfect! 

* The buttons on the massage remote control were all ""there"" - not faded, worn or broken. 

* The control was actually easy to figure out, nothing that required a magnifying glass or an Egyptologist to decrypt; each button had one word that spoke clearly to what it did. And you don't have to figure out how to 'combine' the buttons to get what you want. Each button, one function, that's it.

* There was a little strap/keeper on the one arm of the station under which I tucked the control; no ""deep sea fishing"" for the control because it's dangling at the end of a long line or caught under something. 

* The massager itself worked quite well, not dragging and groaning along as if the motor is about to give up the ghost. Very deep and relaxing. I am sure I fell asleep several times -- to the point of snoring. At the end-of-service, at closing time, me still snoozing, they said I could stay overnight, but I would have to clean. I packed up pretty quick! (Actually I had to get on anyway, to get downtown to the Tribal Smoke Shop for my bargain cigs before THEY closed.)

It seems to me as though a lot of shops have at least one of these kinds of pedi station problems; the station I rode at this shop had none.

And, being very-old-school, I've been thrilled with the ambient music ... mostly classic soft 'beautiful music' instrumental covers, a bit of new-age, some relaxing classical choices, a few soft classic vocals. During my pedi, a few of the tunes I recognized (and remembered so as to mention here):

* L'amour Est Bleu (Love Is Blue) (Paul Mariat, 1967)

* Music Box Dancer (Frank Mills, 1978)

* Lara's Theme (from 'Doctor Zhivago') (Maurice Jarre, 1965). 

IDK if it's Sirus/XM ... or Pandora ... or someone's MP3 player ... or what ... but I'm diggin' it.

So far, this is high-quality work, at reasonable prices, and with short wait. Go for it.

UPDATE: I've used NewStyle about a dozen times now ... and I've pretty much settled in here. The service from almost every tech has been quite good. With apologies, I've stopped using LaBelle. LaBelle is just a good bit further from my home ... and NewStyle can handle my walk-in fetish much more readily. But I can still recommend LaBelle's quality of work.",2017-06-12 04:11:07

We also had the pleasure of trying that sticky rice and custard combination. It was wonderfully sticky sweet and salty. The best part was it came out nice and hot (just the way the dessert should be).

The hostess was very nice and asked how we heard about Poppy Den and once I said Yelp, she asked if I was an Elite. I would give an extra star just because she knew what yelp was. 

The only hiccup was that they couldn't ifnd a happy hour menu so we had to wait about 5 minutes to find one. 

I had the Bellini champagne cocktail, I originally thought the waiter only brought us champagne, but he explained that the peach flavoring is added in and they don't use a juice like a mimosa would look. It tasted fresh and crisp. The only downside is that I am a slow drinker and it warmed up in the patio area, so the cocktail became room temperature. 

The food was unique, I enjoyed the watermelon salad, caprese salad (another slice of tomato and mozzarella wouldn't hurt), and the chicken wings were scrumptious. The chicken wings had this delicous crust around the chicken meat and then was drizzled in a spicy and sweet asian sauce. If I was dining alone, I could have had the salads and the chicken and make an entire meal. 

The potstickers were fine, and the meatballs were mushy, nothing special. 

From the regular menu we had the tomato soup, it had a light sweetness to it once it hit your tongue, which then transcended into a light heat. I also got to try the crabcakes, yes they are small, but man are they packed with crab. Chef sosa made a good choice to go with quality over quantity here, and the pickled asian apple pear was a very nice light and refreshing touch to something that is usually so heavy. 

For dessert they were out of the fortune cookie with mango sorbet so we ended up getting the trio of sorbets. The sorbets were very tasty, but the waiter said that we had mango, strawberry, and pineapple ginger. I couldn't taste the ginger, and it tasted more like a pineapple coconut sorbet. The flavors were intense, but not sweet! The cookie bowl that it came in was a delite to munch through and acted as a great tool to move the sorbet into the mouth. 

Service was great, our waiter came to check on us quite often and didn't make a big deal that one party member was 90 minutes late. Our water glasses were always full, and came right away with a dessert menu and offered suggestions and was very knowledgable about the menu.",2013-06-23 04:38:50

Before ordering, the host invited me to step into the kitchen to see the specials. They all looked amazing, but I knew they would be massive portions. 

I ordered chicken souvlaki, thinking it would be a manageable lunch, but I say ""nay nay""!  The first thing out was the Greek salad. A whole plate of Greek salad. With a 1/3 pound of feta cheese on top. I planned to end at halfway through. 

Then came the main, a healthy portion of perfectly tender and juicy chicken, with a massive amount of lemon roasted potatoes and rice pilaf, accompanied by a perfectly fresh, homemade tsatziki.

Plus, while you wait in line you can observe the wall arts, they're all painted in the recent year, very artsy. 

Oh & Please don't forget to try all their special sauces, i especially love the apple flavor one and the green cilantro tasting one. For entree, I got their perfect balance bowl with chicken and tofu. Tofu was additional charged since they don't do half protein. The second time I came I got another protein balance bowl with lamb meat bowl, and my bf got a salad. We both love our food. I love their chick peas masala. If you aren't sure about which masala to pick, you can ask to try it before you order. The food is great, and the customer service is excellent!

For beverage, I got the mango lemonade it was so tasty. I tried it the first time when I came here for a yelp event, i love it so I had to get it again! The mango is very strong, it's not like those water downed drinks you get at the grocery store. Yuuummy.

So, it's nice that there are other options , but there isn't much seating inside.  There is a pretty large patio but who wants to sit outside in the middle of summer?  

After seeing the high reviews on Yelp, we headed on over.  Unfortunately, they did not live up to those reviews.  I'm guessing that those high reviews were written after a few too many drinks when anything tastes great.  First off, we were told they were running about 15 minutes behind so we'd have to wait for our food.  Okay.  So, we ordered some chips and salsa, hoping to enjoy those while we waited, but nope.  They came out with our tacos.  How hard is it to reach behind you, grab us some chips and salsa, and send us on our way? When we finally did receive our food, I was surprised to see how small the tacos were.  It was fine because they were only $2.50 each, but the menu should specify that they are street tacos.  At this point, I was glad that we ordered the chips and salsa because there was no way two street tacos were going to fill us up and I wasn't willing to wait another 15 minutes.  The tacos also weren't anything special.  They were just okay.  I ordered one al pastor and one carne asada while the hubs ordered one pork and one chicken.  They were all kind of plain and lacked much flavor.  Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed and wouldn't stop in here again.",2017-07-12 17:38:46

This Cabo Wabo is located on the corner of the Planet Hollywood Resort, on the Strip.

The good part of our visit was the margaritas.  We decided it was a better value to get the pitcher.  The margaritas where delicious, and had a good about of tequila in them.  If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would only come for the margaritas.  The server was also very friendly and attentive.

The food items were very expensive, and the portion size was very small.  I have seen more rice and beans on children's plates at other restaurants.  On the plus side the small portions you do get taste good and are freshly made.

Some of the negatives:

I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they didn't toss a basket of chips and salsa on your table when you sat down.  Here it's a $6 charge if you want chips and salsa.

Most of the items do not come with beans and rice, that will cost you and additional $7 on top of the cost of the entree dish.

Check your bill before paying.  I noticed a $8 ""CNF"" charge on my bill.  When I asked what that was I was told it was a concession fee because the Planet Hollywood charges them for being on the property.  Basically, Cabo Wabo wants to charge me outrages food prices and then on top of that help pay their rent.  I informed the server I wanted to speak to the manager because I was not going to pay this additional fee.  She returned with different bill with the CNF fee removed.  I can't imagine how many people pay that fee without asking a question as to why. 

Although the margaritas were delicious, and the food good, albeit small in portion, I would not come back here because of the very expensive prices and because of them trying to add on additional charges to my tab without informing me.",2015-08-13 05:01:45

I love the layout of the location - there's a section for each part of the store.

The garlic bread was also fresh and piping hot which was good becaussseee...

Our salads were completely forgotten about. The waiter raved about the dressing, then they never came. Then our entrees took an extremely long time to arrive. Originally we were asked where we would like to sit, we told them it didn't matter, so he put us in the corner- which was fine. But from then on it was like that corner did not exist. For a ""white table cloth"" dining experience, the service definitely left a lot to be desired.

Comfortable seating. Plenty of free parking. Self serve water for the pups. Grass. Generally nice and responsible dog owners. Separate areas for large and small dogs. Open 6:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. A great resource for downtown Phoenix.

I suggest you bring your own clean-up bags just in case. I assume it's a budget issue, but this park relies on random bags placed on the fence by patrons. 

The only significant negative I can identify is that the park is a bit dark after sunset. The parking lot is well lit, but the dog areas are illuminated only by neighboring streetlights. Seemingly not a safety issue, although I'd recommend going with a friend in the evening just in case. Monitoring your dog in such low light can be a challenge.

Their service is also pretty decent. The workers could care a little more though, like welcoming their customers or thanking them on their way out. But for the most part, they're chill and friendly with a smile.

The wait isn't that long, being that they're usually always busy during lunch hours. I still appreciate their craftiness in making their acai bowls and how great they taste! They have a variety of bowls, juices, smoothies, and even shelved products near the counter. They also have what seems like local business cards on another table near the pick up station which has extra napkins and spoons on them.

The interior is very hipster-like, not to mention all their clocks lol, and they've got free wifi with no purchase needed! They also have a couple tables outdoors if you just wanna relax in the sun. I'm fond of their music choice because it fits perfectly in the whole theme of the place. VERY RELAXED.

(And by difficult to get to I mean it's not right on the subway line. Yes, I am spoiled.) We walked up from Ossington station, and it took about 10 minutes. We met for 10:30am, which was perfect timing because this spot is SMALL, and it being (an unseasonably warm) February, we didn't feel like waiting outside.

I ordered the huevos rancheros. They were really good, and I was pleased at the large portion of guac that was served with it. I hate it when people skimp on the guacamole. The meal was filling, although I wish that I had ordered a side of meat. Because meat is delicious.

I was less impressed with the lox and latke. The latke was soggy. Tsk tsk for a soggy latke.

The service was relaxed, but attentive. There was a mix up on the bill though, with a $3.50 side being coming up as $35. I'm sure it was a one time mix up (I've worked serving, it can totally happen), but it might be worth it to keep an eye on the bill.

My friend and I walked in last night without a reservation (I recommend making one, especially on a Friday night) but we were lucky that they had a 2 top open up for us. I ordered the steak and my friend got a pasta dish that were both absolutely delicious. Then it came time for dessert and we were stuck between ordering this coffee ice cream dish vs. a chocolate tart. One of the chef's overheard us debating which dessert we wanted and nicely enough brought out both!!!! It was the best day of my life. The coffee ice cream dessert had this cream that turned into pudding when you poured it over the ice cream. I don't know what the heck it was, the chef quickly described it, but whatever it was it was SO DAMN GOOD! 

Then there was the bathroom. First of all it was so warm and cozy, I literally wanted to curl up in a ball and park it in there for a few hours. The toilet or ""bidet"" as I guess its called was like a robot and had a heated toilet seat and a massager!!! Maybe thats TMI but I'd never seen anything like it in my life so I just had to rave about it haha. Not to mention the cool hand drying device attached the sink and the plethora of breath mints available - coolest bathroom ever.

It was a beautiful afternoon/night  so I thought I would pop in for Happy Hour (not knowing if they had one or not). They have HH prices on select food and drinks all day.  I decided to order regular food instead of order off the HH menu. 

First Impression: fast food, good chips and salsa bar, friendly service, good selection of bottled beers and draft beers. 

Food: Carna Asada Burrito. Lots of meat. You could probably for go ""enchilada style"" and pour one of the (free) salsas over the top. Good flavor. I would definitely order it again. 

Atmosphere: Indoor dining looked comfortable but choose outdoor patio. The fire strip table top was perfect for the quickly dropping temperature. Downside....country music blaring on the outdoor speakers. I asked a server if they always played ""country"". She said ""the DJ starts at 6:30 and plays a variety of music.""

After a not-so-great dinner close by, my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to cozy up for an after dinner drink or two. Lucky for us, Humble caught our eye. 

We grabbed a table inside, near the roaring wood fired oven. The decor was modern and clean, with just the right amount of cozy. For a Friday night, it was busy, but not crowded. Busy enough to know this is a great spot, but not so crowded and loud that you can't have a conversation or find somewhere to sit. 

I thought the wine list was great- they had a full page of wines by the bottle and a nice sized selection of wines by the glasses. We decided to split a bottle, we agreed that the price was pretty fair. We didn't order any food this time, but we did enjoy watching the pizzas come out all bubbly and smelling amazing from that beautiful oven. It was a great atmosphere to relax and sip some wine with my beau. 

We liked our first experience so much that we came back only a week later. This time in the late afternoon (they open at 4pm). We snagged two bar seats by the oven this time, so we got to watch the chefs making the pizzas. We decided to get food this time and, based on a chef's suggestion, went with the brussels sprouts and a pizza to split (can't remember which one). The sprouts were amazing. They were roasted and tossed with crispy pancetta and a vinaigrette. The pizza was straight from the oven hot, with a crispy crust and the perfect amount of toppings. 

I can't wait to come back and try more of their delish menu and drink more wine. Its definitely a place I'll bring my parents when they visit and somewhere I'll remember for my beau and I's next date night.",2015-09-30 12:48:36

My first breakfast at Tryst, and I cannot wait to go back!  (Especially since Tryst offers organic and local produce-- just say no to GMOs!)

Arrived at 1pm and had only 45 minutes to spare-- good thing I already checked out the menu online and decided what I wanted to try: the Monte Cristo w/ a side of sweet potato tots, and a cup of organic coffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=tYVvx24tyHyryZWgtiTVOg.  Was seated in Joanna's section- friendly server!  The Monte Cristo- two slices of French toast with ham, melty gruyere cheese, and strawberry jam, sliced into two halves, arrived nine minutes after I ordered it-- fantastic!!  The dish looked beautiful, and the plate hadn't even touched my table for two seconds when I overheard Joanna describe to someone at another table what I had ordered.  It was that striking!

Looked so tantalizing, and I loved the sweet and salty combination.  I just wished it was heartier... I worked very hard to eat only one-half of the dish.  Same thing with the sweet potato tots (loved the crunch factor of these!)... It didn't take me long to work my way through half of the dish, and I still wanted more!  The Black and Tan organic coffee (black, no cream) was just OK.  I might try a cappucino next time, if only to check out the coffee art.  ;)

I think I'm going to check out the Pineapple upside-down pancakes tomorrow!

Houchija one also has cream filling within red bean, but I found it is a little sweet; my personal preference would be more tea bitterness. Haven't said that the Houchija flavour is rich too.

Went for the first time because they were offering a free scoop to celebrate the start of Spring, also accepting donations to support a child with Down syndrome. The two behind the counter were super friendly and encouraging me to try whatever I would like. Seeing as I was already getting a free scoop I tried to limit my tastings to just two. One was a super man one they had created using vanilla, blueberries and peaches, it was good, fruity, perfect for a hot day, and the other was the one I ended up getting the lemon ginger. It was super delicious and fresh and light. Don't get more than one scoop bc that ginger will start to take over, but worth one scoop for sure. I look forward to returning in the warm weather months so I can stroll down Detroit Rd on a hot day enjoying another one of their many flavors.

The izakaya atmosphere is relaxed but also fun.  There are pachinko machines, samurai swords, and artwork hanging on the wall in the room while bunches of retro and novelty items appear at the bar to entertain if you happen to find yourself there.  There are actual pachinko machines places just outside the restrooms to enjoy if you can figure out how to use'em lol.

The menu offers a lot of choice for meat and veggie lovers alike and there were a few favourite that I would recommend:

Tako Wasabi (raw): I like it better than the cooked version.  Get more of the octopus flavour.

O'Sho Kaarage: really well executed deep-fried chicken with some sea-salt and pepper

Real snow crab pressed sushi: I really enjoyed the crab paste that contained crab brains.

Kinchan Chicken Wings: the touch of curry flavour gave it a little bit of heat that was nice.

What was slightly a let-down was the Kingyo-stye ""death"" chicken.  The menu warns that ""Do not order if you aren't too good with spicy food!"" but had less kick than tabasco or siracha in my opinion.  It was only saved by the fact that it was $10 pitchers of Sapporo. :)

The main restaurant was a normal looking sports bar, but when we got out back it was another story with the pen for bull riding.

For $20 a person, we went up to the VIP section which was made the weekend for two eager little boys. We had great seats, and a server for food and drinks. It was really busy in the VIP section, and we only had one server so everything was a bit slower than expected. Our server was doing her best, but it would be nice if they had another server to help her out. 

We stayed for appetizers, drinks, dinner for the munchkins and 10 or so bull riders. The food was so so, but the drinks were strong, and the entertainment was top notch. I'd certainly recommend planning a night out to Buffalo Chip.

For appetizer I had the chilled pea soup with shrimp which had good flavor and texture, bit reinforced my previous conviction that I only like my soups hot. The bread and dip they serve in the beginning was not that great,  the bread being cold and the dip basically just a tomato sauce with olive oil.

The lamb was a disappointment. The polenta was mushy, the green olive flavor was overpowering and the lamb itself was small in quantity and taste. I expected more from such a well known and expensive restaurant. I've had much better lamb in greektown.

The coconut sponge cake did not feel much like coconut and was dense and dry in the middle.  Pineapple salsa saved the day but not completely.

With Vietnamese food my regular order would be bun thit nuong or pho tai or fresh spring rolls, so over the years I have been able to compare better tasting ones and not so good ones. 

I ordered the bun thit nuong. My hubby ordered a thai iced tea and grilled pork chop. After they took our order, it was not less than a minute that my hubby's food came out. I literally told the guy ""oh no, this must not be our order because we just ordered less than a minute ago."" He went back to check and sure enough it was. Hmmmm...ok so I don't know if this is how most Vietnamese restaurants work (pre cooked pork chop)?? But I can only imagine it dries out that way? and how long as it been sitting there??My hubby has been ordering this same dish for years at every Vietnamese restaurant we go to and I've never seen food brought out this quick. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Fast service is one thing, but that was clearly not the case. It was food that had been sitting there. He did not like his food. 

The next thing that I feel this restaurant needs to work is how to deal with a bloody finger and a dirty band-aid. What I mean by that is our server had a bloody finger (some sort of wound) that was pretty big (about a 1 inch cut oozing with blood to the point where I could see it. The band-aid was not fresh (you know when it is tightly wrapped around and dry looking). This band-aid looked as if he possibly wore it all day or washed his hands with it. When he set down my hubby's food I could see the blood on his finger and band-aid half falling off. I would think there is some health requirement about wounds and how to properly cover them when serving food???

The thai iced tea came in a  small glass in which water is served. Everyone around us had a mason jar with their thai iced tea, not sure why we did not get one. Filled with ice, my husband got 3 sips of thai iced tea. 

My bun thit nuong came 10 minutes after my husband's food (I guess they actually cooked the meat on mine). It has bland and I did not enjoy it. 

They also messed up our order and charged us for food we did not order. Of course they fixed it.

My go to order is Okinawa tea, with sea salt cream, and boba. Their ""normal"" sweetness level is perfect when paired with the sea salt cream. The tea stands out, but then you get this creamy saltiness that's such a unique flavor. The boba is the perfect texture and flavor. 

I've had a sip of the Hokkaido and it taste like the White Rabbit Japanese candy in liquid form. It was a little too cloyingly sweet for me, but I could imagine it being good if it were toned down a bit.

I've also had the cold brew with sea salt cream and must agree with many other reviews, that it is indeed delicious. If I were able to come earlier in the morning, I would definitely order it more frequently. 

While I appreciate the optional scoop of real taro on top of the taro slush, it's not something I would order again because the drink started tasting watered down about halfway through. Not going to knock the place for it though, since tea really is the main focus.

It was a $15 cab ride to the Bellagio, which was a shame because that's where we spent the majority of our time.  Another negative is that there is a train thing that goes through the hotel somewhere .... not very descriptive but I could hear a train whistle all night - LOUDLY.  If you're going with kids, this is a good option because there is no casino at the hotel ..... good in some ways, bad in the other.  It would be great if we had closer options to a casino but if you're with a group and some want to go home and some want to continue gambling, you're out alone or you're stuck going back with your group.

In terms of the food I like the fact that they leave off the sauce to give us the full meat experience. I liked the ribs and pulled pork. Sauce wise, the sweet sauce was probably my favorite. The spicy takes a bit to get that burn feeling but pretty good as well. The brisket was tender which was nice as well. We did get a couple of hard to chew pieces. Personal opinion is that the brisket was overseasoned with salt on the outside. Sides wise, slaw was good, potato salad was ok. I like that they served broccoli with garlic.

The only reason to go to this location of Lao Laan Xang is if you have a party of four or more.  The only advantage it has over the Willy Street location is size.  

Our waitress was so completely unfriendly that I was turned off of the whole restaurant.  We arrived and had to wait for two other people to show up.  During the 10 minute wait for our friends, we were asked if we wanted to order at least twice.  As soon as our friends sat down, the waitress was back to ask if we could order yet.  Uh...no?  Could they look at the menu first?  Jeez louise, lady.  Nothing was ever said with a smile, and it was apparent that she couldn't wait for us to get the f-outta' her restaurant.  I'd like to add that they were hardly busy.

The food was delicious, just as it is at the other location.  The food almost makes me want to give it 3 stars.  But you know what?  I did not walk away feeling ""A-OK"" about the experience.  All I wanted to do was to pinch the waitress' cheek and say, ""Heyyyyy!  Buck up, sunshine!  It's called ""customer service!""

I was just ready to eat! Been here a handful of times and I'm just not a fan of joes crab shack. Feel like seafood? Check out boiling crab or hot n juicy!

Anyways while we were waiting a little boy who was with his family went to go ask the hostess how much longer. I believe his family sent him. I went up there to ask how much longer the same time. The hostess( blonde hair, young, and had a nose piercing) was not even acknowledging the people walking up. They had to talk to her. The little boy finally got her attention and ask how much longer. She holds up the two sheets full of names and says this is how many people are waiting. The little boy walks away and tells his family. Mom was furious and speaks to the manager. The hostess heard everything and wasn't too happy. Everyone of her co workers that walked up she told what had happened and even pointed at the lady who complained!
I just found it to be very unprofessional and rude. My friend and I both work in a restaurant and there is no way that would have been allowed. I understand it's crazy busy, but that girls behavior was ridiculous. When she called our name, she tells us wow you guys get a booth. That's what you get for being patient. I don't know what she meant by that. 

Next off the food. Anything fried there is pretty good. I don't eat unhealthy but I figure it valentines day, so wth. My friend and I shared the sampler! It was pretty good. I asked for a Caesar salad sub balsamic dressing on the side. I reminded him twice and it still came out wrong. Our waiter (an older gentleman) knew too but chose not to say anything and I didn't want to complain.  So I ate it. I gave this a low rating because I don't plan on returning,   The food is not that good.

Mike V. sets me up with one of his ""best salesmen"".

They start telling me how great a Hyundai is, with their free lifetime oil changes. I correct them on that.

They are only free if you do ALL of your maintenance there..Including the 15k service, where they charge you almost $200 to change air filters. They seemed shocked at the ""unknown"" news.

I give him all the information on my car/loan, and he gives my keys to the appraiser. Things that rubbed me the wrong way....I guess I'll start at the beginning. 

-1-
 He tells me the registration in my glove box is expired. Even though the sticker on my back plate (that has MY plate number on it) doesn't expire until Mar2014. Please, don't have a cow. My registration is current, I don't see why you need it anyways, but continue.

-2-
While they are appraising my car, we go look at new options. Most of the cars are locked, and can't be opened to look at the inside. I wait for the salesman to fuss around with who ever to get the keys. When the car finally gets unlocked, the carpets are filthy! My car has less dirt on the than a new one with 10 miles! 

-3-
I told him that I wanted to know what the appraisal was for my car, and to talk numbers before a test drive. He didn't seem amused. Didn't understand this....seeing as how we would have to walk back to my car (close to his office) to get my daughter's car seat for a test drive anyways.

-4-
They low balled the amount they were going to give me for my car. When they gave me the amount, I said absolutely not. The sales man, who I wish I would have remembered his name, asked me very rudely if I had ""even KBlueBooked the car"". When I told him yes, and that the amount they were giving me was a good $2000 less, he hopped on KBB.com like he had a fire under his ball sack!

I did my research before I came here, jackass.

-5-
They weren't going to give me the loan amount. He told me that I was ""always going to have negative equity in a car""...Which isn't true. If you pay it off, there is no negative equity. So, how am I ALWAYS going to have negative equity? I corrected him on that...

-6-
They wanted $2500 down, and a payment that was $100 more a month. Okay, so the payment isn't what gets me. It's their attitude about it. When I told him that I was hoping to get money down from my old car (by trading it in), he told me that was ""illegal"". I'm sure his thick skull misunderstood me, but he went on and on about how they are a dealership, and don't carry cash, and that they can't pay me to drive their cars. He then wanted to know who told me that. 

Ugh.

-7-
My daughter (13mo) had started to get fussy in his hot, small ass office. I told him that I needed to go. He kept pressing me, about what they could do to earn my business. I asked him if it was guaranteed that they could pay off my loan, with zero down.... ""Well, no, I have to ask to see....""

Well, then No. Don't come to me with something that isn't a guarantee. Shit annoys me like no other. If you don't bring me your absolute best deal, please don't waste my time. I don't want to do this ""back and forth"" thing all day.

-8- 
The interest on the loan would be a full 1% more than what I have now. Even though on their website, it says 0% APR, but, he informed me that is only on ""selected cars"".

-9-
ONCE AGAIN, my daughter starts screaming. Patience lost with his bullshit, I say, 'I'm not trying to be a bitch, but do you have my keys? I need to GO ! "" The appraiser still has my keys. He leaves the office.

-10-
The hostage holding salesman does not come back in with my keys.

Instead, he sends another person to try and seal the deal. Even after telling this new guy that I was not interested, he followed me out to my car!

He continued to explain how ""great of a deal this was"", and how they don't even make the body of my 2year old  SUV anymore, that the warranty on my car is going to end...(?) 

It's my understanding that the warranty on every Hyundai is 10years/100,000 miles, whichever comes first. Or just the cars that you pick & choose? So far, mine is 2yrs/18,000miles. WOW! That sure is expiring SOON!

I get my daughter in her car seat, tell him once again that I am not interested, and drive off. If I could have given him the finger, I would have.  I can't stand when I feel like I'm being fucked.

I know that this is a business of making money, but they lie to get you in. I have at least seen what they had to offer, which was NOTHING, and I at least know.

JM6rgNDFZWer6RWYahypww,oUK6Xs5dPPnP4whFeZExGg,7aSOA5TfyIH3KHdSqRoTaA,3,2,0,0,"I've been sitting on my review for Carino for well over a week. Humming and hawing as to what rating I should give it. It's definitely different. Japanese-Italian-French fusion food. I see the influence here in the menu, from the items to the red and green border. The decor at Carino hasn't changed at all since it was AKA Winebar. I want to say it's the same right down to the tables and chairs. Even the black chandeliers haven't moved. While this may or may not be a point of contention for some people, when you're breaking ground on a new ""food pairing"" per se, I think it's important to ensure people understand what it is you're trying to do. And your interior decorating can go a long way in communicating that for you. I don't quite understand what Carino is all about. This is the point I was stuck on as to whether Carino would get a 3 star or a 4 star.

In every other aspect, it's a 4 star restaurant. Its clean, the service is great, the food is well presented, heck... its even got a free corkage night (Tuesdays!). When I was there, four of us shared the following:

Crab cakes with Dashi jelly, white balsamic vinegar and tomato confit
Mozzarella Agedashi with ume and basil tempura
Lamb ribs with Japanese pot au feu and mashed potato
Mentaiko pasta with pollock roe, scallop and prawn
Teriyaki Kobe beef burger with mixed mushroom and mayo on rice (note: it's more of a rice patti turned bun... not a side of rice. The menu isn't really clear there.)

I enjoyed pretty much all of it, except the agedashi. There just wasn't enough flavour going on there. If you get the crab cakes, please, please, please make sure you get a bit of the Dashi jelly on there! That makes the crab cake. Lamb ribs... well, it's lamb. It was pretty good, but didn't leave me with anything to gush on about in the review. What I did particular enjoy was my quarter of the Teriyaki Kobe beef burger. What made it interesting was the rice patti as the bun option. I can't imagine this burger being served just on a bun and I'm not entirely sure why that's an option...? Skip the bun. Go for the rice patti turned bun.

Price-wise, I'd say it's reasonable for the type of food you're getting. There's a lot of thought and effort going into the preparation of the dishes, and they're quality. I didn't leave feeling as though I hadn't gotten any value for the money I just spent. I really just don't quite understand what Carino is supposed to be about. Plain and simple. 

Anyway, give it a shot! If nothing else... to try that burger. I may head back to try out this brunch others are raving about. Maybe a meowrning palate pleaser will have me purring more contentedly. 

Oh, and if you're looking for the restroom, there's only one. Hope you don't mind sharing. It's at the bar near the bar.",2012-12-15 05:31:12
e3umzrrdTiUeooTCAhKBww,0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,zJtw9HxZNZSEGcI6ees5fw,2,11,7,5,"I was comped a couple tickets to see just the show only. You have the option of ordering food which was 20 bucks per person. Originally I was just gonna watch the show but since I have never stepped foot in this place called Kahunaville located inside the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, I was curious about the food they served here. So I gave in and decided to share a meal with my wifey. 

If you refer to the picture of the menu I took, your meal starts off with Bread (macadamia white chocolate roll), Salad (mixed greens, provolone, pineapple, strawberries, mandarin oranges, tomatoes and pecans tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette topped with fresh shaved toasted coconut. Then you select a main entree. We chose the Ahi Tuna (pan seared yellow fin tuna served rare with wasabi mashed potatoes, baby bok choy, and a ginger soy reduction. Lastly you you get dessert (we got a white chocolate covered cake pop). Drinks are extra.

The bread was basically a Hawaiian sweet roll with raisins. It seemed a bit dry. Based on the description of the salad you would think that they would give you a big bowl of it. Turns out that they only bit a tiny amount of each mentioned so when you actually dig into it, there really isnt much substance to it. I finished it pretty quick. The main entree was very good. The fish was encrusted with ground pepper and sliced into 6 thin pieces. It was very tasty but seemed more like an appetizer. Lastly, the cake pop for dessert was equivalent to two bites. The white chocolate gave it good flavor.

Service was weird. The first thing that threw me off was that they had you share a table with complete strangers. Our table mates, although they were nice, seemed irritated that the Teriyaki Steaks that they ordered were both well done even though they wanted both to be medium rare. Our server was assigned several tables and at times was nowhere to be found. The few times that she did show up, it seemed like she was in a hurry to get our plates out of the way even though we were not done eating yet. The worst part was that it took forever to get the check and by the time I got the receipt to sign, half the people in the room were already gone. Plus on top of that, a gratuity of 20 percent was already added to our total even though I was the only one that ordered. I didnt think she deserved much of a tip let alone 20 percent.

As for the show, it was mediocre at best. Starts out with some dude playing the guitar singing a couple of Hawaiian songs while firing off one liners at the audience to see if anybody was actually paying attention. Then comes an Elvis impersonator singing yup, you guess it, more Hawaiian songs. I have seen plenty of Elvis impersonators in my lifetime. This guy was not all that good. Eventually a couple of guys and 3 girls come out to start their ""Luau"" dancing while another lady comes out as the lead singer does her thing. This is what alternated pretty much for the 1 hour and 15 minute duration of the show.

In the end, everything put together did not impress me much. The entertainment was 3 stars. The food and service that went along with it was 1 star. One good thing to note is that their drummer/music dj is the father of Bruno Mars! If anything that is something worth mentioning. So if you are planning on watching this show, I recommend you eat somewhere else and just try to enjoy the show itself. Its not too bad but at the same time I have seen better. Come early to get good seats for its general admission.

SdKMWEBkqR6rZmYRestOVw,WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,4,4,2,2,"What a deal!  I was a bit skeptical before we arrived.  Judging from other reviews, many of the dishes were hit or miss, and I was anxious that the Americanized tapas would be too much fried, not enough flavor compared to the Spanish inspired dishes at more traditional tapas restaurants.  After the meal was done, I realized that I did not miss the tomatoes, lentils, and light ceviche that I thought I would, and we were all completely satisfied.  On top of it all, the all you can eat is an amazing deal!  Who knew that value like this existed for tapas in Vegas?  Now I do, and you do too!  Tip the servers well, you're saving mad money on the meal.

Enthusiastic praise for:
Hummus and Guac: Great way to start the meal (just a little short on chips and bread to go with it).  The portions of the dip were incredibly generous, we were scooping the leftovers up with our forks.

Tater fries: Great spice, nice sauce

Tempura green beans: Not too greasy, perfect fried coating and dip, we ordered seconds of this dish!

Tuscan pizza: YUM!  Heavy-handed with the pesto, in a good way.  Crisp & soft crust, well done!

Salad 3-way: When you need a break from the heavier entrees, you can pretend you're getting your veggies in with this dish.  The diversity of the salads was nice, we all had a different favorite.

Fish tacos: perfectly fried, not too heavy, well seasoned. We suggest topping it with a little leftover guac for a blissful mouthful.

Lettuce cups: tasty glaze on the shrimp, nice accompanying sauce, crisp lettuce adds great texture.

Take it or leave it:
Octopussy, bruschetta, sea bass, grilled PB & J.  All were good, if you're in the mood I would not discouraging ordering these.  They were well enough executed, but basic.

Not worth the tummy space:
Mac n' cheese slider, chicken fingers, tater tots.  The fried mac n' cheese + slider bun = the fried and bread overpower the taste.  We wanted gooey and cheesy that this dish lacked.    Chicken fingers were just  ""meh"", I could get these at my school cafeteria.  Tater tots had an odd texture and taste, like instant potatoes rolled in garlic salt and fried.  I missed the texture of ""real"" potato chunks in there.",2011-01-24 19:11:13

The 1st time I ate here, I ordered out & took it next door. This time I wanted the whole experience. It was a Sunday afternoon around 4 pm. There was one other 6 person party there discussing catering options for their upcoming wedding to be catered by Royal Caribbean.

The waitress was super sweet, prompt, made great recommendations & even offered to comp our appetizer if it did not meet her praises. 

We started out with the seafood fritters that came with the best homemade remoulade sauce I have EVER had...extra spicy! They were a nice golden brown & the batter had a slightly sweet taste. For our meal, we flipped the menu over & ordered the chicken 3 ways:stewed, jerked & curried. We got 2 sides that were extra BIG! We chose the beans & rice & cabbage. The cabbage had a sweet flavor, but Ben said no sugar in it only a sweet vinegar. The stewed chicken was my Beau's favorite and the jerk was mine. The jerked chicken is made from a homemade mixture that I had to call Ben (owner & chef) out to the table to find out more about. The jerk mixture has 5 different peppers & is the hottest sauce I have ever had...which is a good thing. I loved it so much he gave me a big bowl to go which will be perfect on fish. Then he offered to bring us goat which was AMAZING!  Our total bill was $29.00 for appetizer, chicken 3 ways & the sides...now ....that I can do....the combo platter on the back of the menu is the best value. There are enough sides for 4 people. 

On our way out, Ben got us to try 2 of his homemade juices: 1st fresh squeezed mango, carrot & pineapple...delicious...made me want to buy a juicer & 2nd fresh squeezed ginger and pineapple...not my favorite, but Ben swears by it's medicinal qualities for the belly.

This place is definitely a hidden gem!!!",2011-03-30 00:38:08

The focal point in the rear is the pizza oven. Running along the south wall is the bar.  The menu is the same as the other Crust locations. I was here with S, part of the AOB crew. He got an invite from his PR friend to enjoy some tasty treats. Crust put out a small buffet on a 6 top towards the back. There was salad, penne & marinara, huge bacon wrapped shrimp, stuffed shroom caps, fried mozz, chicken skewers, garlic knots, and 1 pizza I didn't get to try. No biggie really but isn't this place named ""Crust""? So I wrongly assumed that they would focus on promoting their PIZZA. I mean I don't think they're known for their chicken skewers or stuffed mushroom caps but maybe... It seemed like a buffet that a mid 20's, just graduated college type would put out at a party. Don't get me wrong. Everything I tasted was good but it was VERY pedestrian. 
The servers were very polite and on their game. I met the partners behind Crust, Mike & Mitch, both nice guys. We got a tour & mini history lesson on the property which was neat. The cool deal-e-o will be when The Ostrich opens in the basement. It's going to be a speakeasy type lounge. Uber cool. I would like to get on a soapbox for just a second. As I said the food was set out buffet style on a 6 top table. You grab a plate, fill it with goodies and go back to your table. Well, there were 3 women who never got the memo. They stood AT the buffet table and chowed. Seriously? Dumbasses! Even S went up for more food & to see if they would get the hint but they just backed away from the food long enough for S to put some on his plate & then moved right back up to the table. And they say ignorance is bliss! 
Ok, that's not part of my rating. Just needed to get that out there.

They need to redesign the new space they bought to match the cute original space next door. An artist could do wonders with those walls. They should make a super cool wall art mural like they have in the original space but even better. I liked the espresso bar and the old school diner look for sure but I sat in the new area and it was pretty ugly, dirty, grungy looking. Flies at the window. I hate that in older buildings. 

Let's start with the name of the place. Why is it called the lunch box and it has only four lunch options? The name is so confusing to me. It is more for breakfast which I did not stop by for. The menu is not correct online and it is very limited. It is also labeled American cuisine but with a mostly Mexican food menu. They do have a Gyro on the menu and some burgers but most of the their food is Mexican breakfast and I am not a fan of fast food Mexican food nor breakfast, usually. 

They do not serve drinks in glasses or cups. I was handed a water in a to go, plastic cup that actually had a bug or seed or something on the cup lip. Also, I have an issue with this from an environmental viewpoint. That is a lot of trash to generate every day. I ordered an Ice tea, and that was fine but only because they did not have any drinks that were diet. Really? I ended up ordering a turkey sandwich by default. The menu says it is actually cooked turkey but it was cold cuts or pressed. It was not fresh cooked turkey. Nothing special. It tasted like a school lunch sandwich. I could have made one at home for less than 2 bucks or bought at school for 50 cents more. It also had an odd taste to it. The sandwich came with fries that tasted very strange. I can not put my finger on it but they were awful and tasted very off. Like nothing I have ever tasted before. I have no idea why but i am guessing the oil. The potatoes were also rawish. 

I had no issue with the service as others stated. In fact the ladies working there are delightful! (thus the one star instead of zero) Yes, at first it seemed slow because I did not know if I could just sit myself or what. However, then it picked up. They are busy so the ladies work hard. However, they were very personable. Surprisingly, the place had a lot of customers. I sure do not get that but it seemed like the people in there were not foodies.",2015-05-04 00:54:15

Taking her in, the staff was courteous and nice as usual, understanding the emergency situation for me. I don't think I had gone in a busy time period at the animal hospital because we didn't sit long to be taken to a room. This time, we got to see Dr. Daniels. I think we had met the previous month her for Shae's Rabies shot - never got to write about that.
Dr. Daniels was just as nice and professional as the first time we got to interact with her. I should've read the vet tech's name tag as well 'cause Shae seemed to get along with them all. I know she can be a handful, so I'm just thankful that they were able to help her out. 
Anyway, they were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. They treated Shae's ear infection for me before leaving, explained what was going on throughout the entire process in a way that I understood, and gave me simple instructions on how to use the prescriptions.

I always hope for the best. I did not, however get the best. Although I would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however, was a total miss. 

I do not want to make any accusations, but they did not seem to be freshly made, maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing, nor did it actually taste appetizing. 

They have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed, and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. 

I went with a glass of Malbec, which was a good choice. Actually, it was the best choice there. Maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here.",2014-08-20 01:15:23

had the avocado bruschetta for app, pork loin for main, and creme brulee for dessert. the bruschetta was delicious but wasn't anything that i couldn't make at home. the pork loin was flavourful but i found it to be a little overcooked. the creme brulee was delicious and that was the best part of the meal =) 

my problem with summerlicious is that you don't know if that menu is representative of their regular menu or if it's a super paired-down version. the food wasn't presented very well either- perhaps they were busier than usual because of summerlicious, but based on what i had, i don't think i would go back here.",2015-07-25 03:38:52

I love Curry House and the curry at ramen houses in the Mitsuwa food court and little Osaka.  I've been eating curry since stationed near Hiroshima in the military so have a personal attachment and fondness for it, with the complex layers of spices and richness which goes so well with the texture and neutral blandness of rice.  I've seen Morimoto on Iron Chef make curry from scratch a couple of times, and always wondered if it would be different from other recipes.  Having researched Japanese curry, I have a basic understanding of its evolution from Indian curry (where it originated), Chinese (soy sauce and garlic based), Thai (coconut milk based) and Japanese (spoiler: Japanese curry uses cocoa!).  There's so much going on in Japanese curry, it's really a blend of some of the most interesting spices that has somehow reached a perfect balance of flavor.  

The cool thing about this place is you really get to personalize how you want your curry and what goes into it, similar to Curry House CoCo Ichibanya.  You get to choose the spiciness, the meat or vegetable, and the quantity of rice.  There's something about their curry though that makes it really tasty here.  I'd have to make a side by side comparison between this place and Curry House though, as I didn't really care for CoCo Ichibanya, mainly because their meat was overcooked.  But for now, I think this place wins in the taste department, I wanted to lick the plate when I was finished.

I booked on Open Table and arrived to find that the place was barely a quarter filled. Nice. We were immediately seated at a table towards the back, near the very filled wine racks. Sadly, my wife and I aren't wine drinkers but if you are then you'll be pleased. I chose a Catawba draft instead.

The taste of four starter is the way to begin here. Scoops of hummus, tzatziki sauce, red pepper and eggplant with a nice serving of slices whole wheat pitas. Probably too much for two to start with because there was a lot there and we were ""uh, what?"" when our main courses arrived.

My wife chose the lobster ravioli. A very large portion with plenty to bring home, especially after we filled up on the starter. Tasty, creamy, seafoody (is ""seafoody"" a word?) and easy to eat. Delish.

I had the quarter chicken which was served with potatoes and other veggies. A very big portion, there was a lot of flavor and texture in here, with the perfectly al dente potatoes.

Dessert? Well, I guess we can try. We split a piece of baclava which came topped with some sort of (lightly peach-flavored) ice cream/yogurt. Delish.

I checked online and saw great review for Dr. jayaraman so I scheduled an appointment with him. The appointment went fine, he listened to my concerns and told me I could have GERD but my symptoms didn't really scream GERD to me. He gave me a prescription and wanted to do an endoscopy the following week which I agreed to. 

Doing any procedure requires a 3 day to 2 week waiting period for pre authorization, unless its escalated. I called the doctors office 3 times to ask about my patient responsibility and when I finally reached someone, she told me my insurance had already approved the procedure. I called my insurance and they told me no, not yet... long story short, lots of miscommunication and it left me very confused as my procedure was the next day.... Anyway, I finally got to speak with Melissa in billing and she sorted everything out. 

Dr. Jayaraman is great. His bedside manner is wonderful and he waited until I woke up after my endoscopy to speak with me. He never seems like he's in a rush, and his nurse Terri is also very good at relaying messages/ questions to him and then following up on labs and whatnot. 

The endoscopy process may seem scary, but it wasn't bad. I fell asleep within 5 seconds and woke up feeling groggy but fine. It was quite expensive, make sure you call the Durango outpatient center to find out how much the facility fee is. Also, call the anesthesiologist office to find out how much he costs. Also, any biopsies done during the procedure is another cost... so keep all that in mind. 

On another note, Dr. J prescribed a medication that was kind of expensive so I asked for another generic brand that would be cheaper and he faxed the new prescription over to my local pharmacy! I highly recommend Dr. J. His front office staff however wasn't very friendly.",2017-01-07 07:42:28

After 6 months of moving into the University neighborhood, it's great to find a solid place for Italian.

Walked in on a Thursday night around 8pm and was immediately seated. We ordered mozzarella sticks, cheese tortellini, and a NY Style Stromboli, all to share. Two Caesar salads to start as well.

Salads were good, but pretty much the only gripe of the night was that it appeared to have ranch dressing on a Caesar salad. Instead of light & complex, we got thick and fatty dressing. These were small side salads anyway so we took them as-is.

The mozzarella sticks were outstanding. Great, homemade sauce with a light fry on the mozzarella. No grease dripping from the food, such a relief. Big fan of the appetizer.

The Stromboli was quite literally a work of art on its own. They cut the pastry in such a way that made presentation a noteworthy part of dinner, check out the photos below! Assembled to order and cooked perfectly, this was one of the best Strombolis I've ever had. Fresh meats, cheeses, and tomato. I believe the sauce was the same as the one with the Mozzarella sticks. It'll be very difficult to order something else next time after trying this!

Cheese tortellini had a great, light alfredo sauce with homemade pasta joining it. You can add broccoli or mushrooms for $1. Pairing this with the Stromboli and splitting both was a great choice.

Pepsi products only, but after such a great meal I can't dock 'em for that. I did have a laugh when the radio station that was on in the restaurant played a very, very long Coca-Cola commercial.

This place,  being one of two choices of Chinese food within walking distance to St. Clair Station, didn't give me much leverage to make harsh criticism considering the other choice is a food court option.
I got BBQ duck on rice to go. It's 6.99 on menu and 7.90 with tax. This is a typical lunch order for $5-6 (including tax) elsewhere in Toronto. Seeing this is an expensive neighborhood, I suppose the extra dollar or two of charge is a-ok. 
Since I read so many HORRIBLE reviews of this place, I honestly didn't expect much. So when I took my first bite into the duck and realized that it is standard quality as elsewhere I've eaten at, I was overjoyed. Of course, I meant elsewhere TAKEOUT food, not restaurant. And having looked around the restaurant, I think the duck was outsourced at a Chinese BBQ shop and/or Chinese grocery store BBQ department. It's not bad - just not all that fresh and crispy as other RESTAURANT quality duck.

So I go to the bar and ask what kinda Rye do you have and his response was ...what do you think !? ..I'm like ok ......
My brother goes to the bar and asks what beers do you got and his reply nothing. but points to the bottles up top shelf ....classy guy ! 
Needles to say we stopped going to that bar and switched to the other guy who was nicer ...
The biggest complaint is staff from everyone we spoke to . Very unfriendly or Rude plain and simple 
If your trying to run a well respected classy establishment hire people that want to work in the service industry ...if you don't like it than get another job ....but in  this case I blame the hall for probably not training well or having a discussion saying hey have fun tonight and enjoy yourself maybe be nice to the people at the event considering the people paying for the wedding are spending alot of money . Just saying
 I hope the fix the issues cause it's a nice hall with nice property .
As for me I'll be booking my events elsewhere that's forsure .",2015-05-31 17:42:21

Rooms could be in any generic chain, but are larger than most, especially  the bathrooms, and the place is still fairly new, so no scary mold or peeling wallpaper to make you uneasy. Roomy and bright with the usual generic ugly hotel furniture (why? are the afraid we are going to try and stuff the dresser into our suitcase)? 
The beds were on the hard side, but the pillows were huge- more like body pillows (yay!), and housekeeping was outstanding, keeping all the linens and amenities refilled.

On the bad side, no fridge or microwave, which surprised me since pretty much everywhere provides them these days, and judging from the throngs of screaming children pounding through the hallways, they're trying to appeal to the family market.

You walk into a simple cheap looking restaurant with pictures and posts around the walls, they ask how many people, you grab a seat, order, eat and pay up front... that's it.  As simple as it gets.

I usually like variety with my noodles so I get the 3 combo noodle with 2 wontons, 2 fish ball patties, and some sliced beef over egg noodles.... I LOVE EGG NOODLES!!!  Noodles comes out in minutes.

Wontons are big and juicy, fish patties are homemade and sliced beef very tender.  Noodles are done perfectly, slightly chewy and the broth is old fashion wonton broth flavoured.  The chili oil is nice and spicy so make sure you put a dollop of it in your noodles if you are chili head like me:)  All for $7.00 plus tax!

Hell, it's not the happiest spot in Nevada.  People usually come here and try not to get locked up, to fight over money, or fight over child custody--not the location for the happiest events (although the county wedding license bureau is on the 1st floor).  

So if you're headed here, a few pieces of advice:
1) the lines to get into the building are long (especially in the morning) so get here early,
2) court is not the place to be casual so dress conservatively -- guys put on a tie and a nice, white or muted color shirt with a collar; ladies, cover up.  You will be judged on how you look, so be formal and (to repeat) conservative,
3) the elevators will take forever if the building is busy (there are only 6 elevators serving 17 floors), so (again) get here early,
4) the Marshals/Court bailiffs are not joking around.  Check in with them, be respectful, and don't talk in the courtroom once the judge takes the bench,
5) court can move really fast -- talk to your attorney before you get there so you know what's going to happen, and 
6) turn off your cell phone.  Seriously. 

All that aside, this place could be much much worse.  East coast courthouses are older, more run down, filthier, angrier, busier and less willing to listen to the people appearing in court.  At least the Clark County Regional Justice Center is pretty.  The lobby is decorated in red rock walls and a three-story glass atrium.  The red rock walls have philosophical and legal quotes carved into them.  Many of the quotes are inspirational . . . or aspirational--summing up what our judicial system aspires to be. 

The court system is all about ""hurry up and wait,"" so come prepared to wait, but remember that it could be much, much worse.  The court staff does a really good job handling a massive number of cases in an efficient manner.",2012-03-11 21:08:49

Not a bad place for ramen considering we folks here in Las Vegas are severely limited with authentic ramen choices.  Call me old school, but I still have the idea the best ramen joints ever are the ones where it's a huge hole-in-the-wall.  Not catering to anyone, but being able to knock your socks off with a simple bowl of noodles and broth.

I hate to say it but Anime Ramen is a bit gimmicky for my tastes.  Sure, I guess it's cool to have little Asian girls trot around in their form-fitting cosplay outfits, and have various anime posters all around.  But for me it takes away from the experience of a true bowl of ramen.  Ramen to folks in Japan is simple, comforting, and in many ways an art form.  The ingredients used to make your broth, the way you make your noodles so they have the right chew, and the additions you add to your bowl are supposed to evoke zen-like feelings when all is done correctly.  Well, that's what I hear anyway.  The environment at Anime Ramen just kinda distracts me from trying to enjoy my bowl of ramen!  

I'll give the cosplay girls credit though, they do a good job with service.  Attentive, kind, and pretty on point.  No complaints there.  But the food just didn't leave any kind of lasting impression on me.  It was ok, nothing special to me.

I tried the shoyu ramen that night.  For $8 I thought it was a bit on the skimpy side, the bowl was small!  I really wish there was more noodles for me to slurp up.  The broth was rather bland for my tastes.  I didn't get much of a shoyu flavor, or a deep broth flavor of any kind for that matter so it left me a bit disappointed.  I added extra soy sauce to the bowl and it tasted a bit better but still not good enough.  Maybe the broth could have used more beef or pork bones?  Perhaps more bonito?  Or maybe even a dash of MSG?  I dunno, it just wasn't that great for me.

I also tried the teriyaki chicken rice plate.  That was ok too, not the best teriyaki but not the worst.  Chicken was on the small size of portions (I am over 200 pounds people!), but at least the rice was good and the veggies were cooked just right.  

There are other things to try on their little menu, various other ramen bowls, teriyaki dishes, a few salads, and appetizers including teri sliders and furikake fries which I've heard are very good.  And nothing over the menu is $10 or so.  Value wise it sounds good, but man do those portions seem small!  This place is great for you lighter eaters.

Me thinks that you are unfortunately paying for the anime-themed ambiance.  I place way more stock in the quality, quantity and taste of your food.  Size matters!",2012-05-15 17:53:30

What I got was a mound of onions with pork scattered through it (and very sparsely I might add).

The best carnitas I've had to date was at two different restaurants in Goodyear: Raul & Theresa's and Manuel's. Both were quite good with Raul & Theresa's winning the gold.

The service at Arriba was decent. The decor decent. However I was extremely disappointed in the pricing and the skimpiness of their kitchen. When I order food I want FOOD. I don't want onions in my carnitas (actually it was a little carnitas in my onions).

Hey if you're an ONION fan and you want to pay $15.95 a plate for them then be my guest. However if you are a CARNITAS fan don't bother with this place.",2013-07-06 23:02:04

I can tell you right now that trying to find a place to park in those garages on a Friday night is a bitch, so after a futile effort I gave in to their complimentary valet service, which I had no problems with. The attendents were pleasant and prompt.

DRINKS: I got there a bit before everyone else, checked my coat, and took advantage of the bar. The bartender was a little snooty and stared a good long time at my ID, but in the end put together a decent drink. The French Connection is quite exotic - the sweet, smooth taste of ports and wines going down, but that sting of scotch on your tongue. The smell was intoxicating. 
My favorite drink out of the two had to be the citrus basil martini. Strong while still being refreshing and elegant. 
At dinner, three of us decided to split number 303 under Interesting Whites, a Muscat. It had an interesting bite to it that wasn't too appetizing alone, but went amazingly with my snapper and the mussels. 

SERVICE: You just can't get it like you used to anymore.... except at this place. I can honestly say that this is the best service I've ever had. The waiter was attentive without being overbearing, made sure that all of our wines/waters/beers were filled, made great suggestions and pairings, and just overall attended to our every need with an expertise that you can't find too many places. Not to mention he was pretty sharp looking, which is always nice for the ladies of the table. Excluding the bartending experience, I would give service at this place 5 out of 5. 

ATMOSPHERE: Despite the points made about the decour in other reviews, I found the atmosphere pleasing. The dining room is large and high-ceilinged without being overbearing, and still providing an intimate atmosphere at dinner. The crowd, we did notice, was much older, however this wasn't any contention. Everyone there seemed to be there for an occasion - a small, intimate gathering for a birthday, or a husband and wife celebrating an anniversary. You got the feeling that to most of the crowd, this was someplace special to them.

FOOD: 
Apps: 
We all shared some steamed mussels and fuites. The fries weren't as hot as I'd like, but flavorful. The mussels were out of this world - they almost tasted coq au vin, and were so incredibly flavorful. My top pick of the evening.
The shrimp over risotto was also very pleasing.  I was delighted to see that the heads were still included on the shrimp (one of my favorite parts), and it was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The risotto was also perfectly cooked, creamy, and flavorful. I liked the addition of the red peppers. 
The fried brie salad was tangy and delicious, so no complaints there. I've had baked brie before, but never fried. It complimented the salad perfectly.

Entrees: 

The snapper over lobster basmati was delicious, and very much was complimented by the wine we had with dinner. The fish was, of course, cooked perfectly, and the rice was flavorful with just the right amount of lobster in it. What I really enjoyed was the sauce - it almost tasted like a buttery, light bechamel with chives, and I definitely want to try and replicate it at home.
The braised shortrib melted in your mouth, and was also cooked perfectly. The sauce complimented the meat and horseradish mashed potatoes very well, though it was said at my table that some thought there was too much horseradish. I personally thought it gave an excellent bite to the carmalized onions and sauce. 

Dessert: 
I can say that they create one of the best executed creme brulee's I've ever had. Pretty darn big, perfectly glossy on the top, and garnished with large, ripe raspberries, this melted on your tongue like nothing else.
I had the chocolate mousse, and it was how I like it - extra dark and delicious, however there was almost twice as much whipped cream as there was mousse, which left me a little disappointed.

Before I came here, I didn't think this would be a place that I would be terribly impressed with, as opposed to other places in Charlotte, but I stand corrected. I would definitely come back here. I pride myself on being a cheap date, but I can honestly say that the $80 bill that was said and done was on par with my experience.",2011-01-26 16:18:45

I also had one of the craziest experiences of my life there. They were very busy and did not have enough room to place everybody waiting so we all decided to sit together and they were OK with that. People were from out of country and locals which was a great combo and we got to talk about how amazing vegan food is. Never in my life would I have thought 4 different people...

I went here often for business lunches and they were always to immediately accommodate us regardless of group size. Menu items could also be customized to your wishes, ie no bacon, or add cheese.

I usually ordered the salmon dish, to their credit they did find new and entertaining way to present a fairly common fish.  One of my favorites was with a orzo pasta with a light cream sauce.

The food arrived fairly quickly and came with about 10 ban chan dishes. But sadly there wasn't any steamed eggs this time (which was included 2 years ago). The soup dishes arrived piping hot and was served in a hot clay bowl. The spicy broth was pretty flavorful with good consistency. My dish had bits of seafood like octopus, clams, and shrimp. The seafood wasn't overcooked or too chewy. The K11 dish arrived a bit later. It's basically a spicy marinated pork and kimchi dish served with steamed/boil tofu triangles. The pork was had great flavor and the tofu went well with the dish. It also help calm the spiciness of the dish. 

We both managed to finish our soup dishes but we barely ate 1/4 of the K11 dish. The portions was generous enough for us to have it for lunch the next day.

After much fanfare, Target finally opened it's famed doors to legions of Canadian shoppers who were fortunate enough to shop at one of their many locations stateside.

We boarded our pets here for 1 night and 1 of them was groomed. 

I think most of my criticism comes from the fact that we have a boarding and grooming place that we LOVE, but unfortunately they were full so we decided to give Pete & Mac's a try - and I'm comparing. 

Play area was nice, and larger than our normal place, so that was a plus. 

The facility overall is larger, which kind of made me nervous. Louder, more barking dogs. It was kind of overwhelming when we toured and I feared it would put stress on my pups while they were there. I also wasn't sure if that meant less attention or personalized feedback. Our other place KNOWS our pups, when I call to check on them I talk to someone familiar and they can immediately tell me how they've been doing because the same person has been with them, versus the number of employees I saw at P&M. I get that a larger facility = more employees, so not necessarily a criticism, it just prohibited them from giving the same type of feedback. I've read some reviewers say they got a report card of sorts but I was not given one, and when I called I had to wait for them to locate my dog and was told they were doing OK... Which may be the case when I called and they were laying in their kennel but isn't indicative of the rest of their stay including their time outside or other interactions. There just wasn't a whole lot of feedback besides they are OK...

They did a good job grooming, but I felt it was overpriced. I paid $60 for my 30lb cocker spaniel. Most I've paid elsewhere is $45.  

All in all it wasn't a bad experience. My dogs came home worn out and weren't traumatized.

The first red flag we saw the expediter eating French fries in front of the line, in front of all the customers, gross. You have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your face. From the waiter he said his name was Jose or something like that. We asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no, probably why the whole kitchen was a free for all and slow. First we ordered the pancake dippers. It was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips. Nothing fancy. Then we watched the expediter ""Jose"" walk over to a table and shake someone's hand with his gloves on.  We then ordered our sandwiches. I had the tree hugger. I think if I ate a tree it would have had more flavor than this. It was a good concept and that's all the good I can say about that. It was a quinoa bun two patties. That had absolutely no flavor at all. It had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes. It had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some herbs or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties. The coffee was good. The hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy. If we were going to come back I would order the burger. It  The fries are bag fries nothing special. We ended up paying fifty dollars which seems very expensive for a mediocre brunch. It is Comparable price to EAT, with less flavor in the food.",2014-01-28 19:38:33

This place has potential, lots of potential.
Made a plan to stop in on a preview night. $1 martinis, & free appitizer, good call on my part. 
The place was lively, but still room to get in and get somewhat promptly served. A profesionals observation was that all the bartenders were hot servers. management made bartenders, I thought this cause, they are all hot, they took the menus away each and everytime, even when you asked to keep it or have another, with each order... yep gone... snatched from my martini soaked fingers. Leave the menus with all that great food and an amazing list of specialty cocktails.... for the Love Of God dont take my menu!!!! The other tell was none of the ""Hot bartenters"" couldnt remember an order and they constantly asked twice or even 3 times to everyone in my area. Lorin was the exception, and she was super sweet, friendly, and wanted to make sure I got EXCELLENT Service. I did, thanks Lorin!
The Food, well my Free appitizer arrived withen a few (2) minutes of ordering it. I know it wasnt at its best but it was still great, Tempura Shrimp with 3 sauces on the side, and free. My first martini arrived about the same time. Juicy wet and ICE COLD just the way I like em. Second Martini was a bit more dry and effen great!!! cucumber, mint, lime and more, another hit. Still hungry I orderd the Blue Louie Burger. This burger with bacon, blue cheese, spinach and wing sauce was FRIKKEN AMAZING a solid 10 and I cant wait to have another please.
I really like what they did with the place and good riddence to that ol' Darcy place. Open with a great patio and center bar, they place has a nice vibe, super good looks, and its easy to dance to. er... I digress.
I cant wait to return and that alone gets 5 stars, but a solid menu, great service, nice atmosphere, and great specials... you had me at specials, make this place a solid must try.
GOOD LUCK and may the third time be the charm, Welcome to the Hood Louie!!!!",2012-10-24 04:14:21

The cakes are high quality, with great, moist flavor and a signature cream cheese frosting. I've yet to try everything on the menu, but speak very highly of their red velvet, cinnamon swirl, and white-white chocolate.  

They also offer seasonal flavors as well - although I think we'll be converting to a set of mini-sized cakes in order to cover more flavors in a single visit from now on. 

The staff is always friendly and I've never had a bad experience here. Their 6pm close time sometimes makes for a rush to get there. Expanded hours would be nice, especially considering they're a chain. But that's just a mild annoyance.

Stopped by the Market Buffet at Arizona Charlie's Decatur because I heard they totally renovated it recently.  I must say it looks pretty good inside for a local's joint!  From what I vaguely remember what it used to look like this is a welcome improvement.  Much cleaner looking.

Visited for lunch one day solo.  If you get the Arizona Charlie's player's card, the lowest level gets you $1 off I believe.  The higher your card status, the bigger the discount.  Lunch time during a weekday was not very busy.  The dining room was more than half full, but there was no line outside by the cashier.

Reaching the buffet line was easy!  Various stations all located on one end.  There's an American section, Mexican section, Asian section, Italian section, as well as a salad & dessert section.  Surprisingly, there's even a sushi section as well as a create-your-own stir fry station.

Overall the food quality is OK.  Really, that's not a bad thing at all.  I was kinda expecting worse.  It has all the things you would expect at a local Las Vegas buffet, and the quality is on par as well.  Fresher things that arrive on the line of course taste better.  I tried not to eat anything that was sitting too long.  The fried chicken wasn't bad, and the meat lasagna was actually pretty good that I even had a second serving.  The sushi was not the greatest, probably made ahead and stored in the cooler because the rice was a little hard.  The rotisserie chicken was moist, and their pizza had a decent crust.

The highlight for me though was a bit of a shocker.  Behind the American/Mexican section of the buffet they have a grill where you can either order burgers, hot dogs, or....QUESADILLAS!  I swear these quesadillas for some reason were delicious!  I got one of each, one with chicken and other with carne asada (steak).  And damn, those carne asada quesadillas rocked!  Tasty when they are fresh made!  I think the chef cooked it just right for me because I like my quesadillas extra crunchy on the tortilla exterior.  Their quesadillas actually topped some of the other local Mexican places in town for me, and blew the chain restaurants out of the water.  I think I had like 3 of them - with a dollop of sour cream, guac, and a hit of Cholula I was into some mighty good eats!  That's why I gave the Market Buffet the extra half star.

Service was quick & friendly, I had no complaints since it wasn't very busy.  My drinks were always kept full, and my empty plates taken away promptly.  Lunch price isn't too bad either with the player's card, comes out to about $10 and change.  So it is a tad more expensive than the local Station Casino buffet.

I know the standards for the Market Buffet at Arizona Charlie's isn't exactly high gourmet, but in a quick lunch it'll do.  It really beats a greasy burger from a fast food joint, even though at this buffet you can get that too.

I'll be back for some more carne asada quesadillas!",2016-11-30 22:53:27

The place is a bit​ pricey but you get what you pay for. Definitely not your average KBBQ place. ​The food was top quality and we even​ ordered their A-5 Kobe since it was my husband'​s birthday. Might as well go big or go home for these sort of events. 
The place was a bit empty when we went there. There was another couple there. You choose what sort of combo you want depending on how many people you have in your party. By the way, the serving sizes are pretty big. We chose the two people option, but we were stuffed by the time we got the Kobe served to us. So, yes, the two option combo is more than enough food.
Our server cooked everything for us, which got a tad awkward because it wasn't busy enough for him to keep him busy with something else.
Otherwise, the place is great! Definitely will come back here again.",2018-02-15 22:08:30

It's a good middle between the incredibly cheap but kind of filthy Asian market and the cleaner but pricier Canadian market. I live firmly in this niche.

This place has everything you might want: a good selection of Asian and Canadian produce, including organic options(!), a fresh seafood section, Halal and non-Halal meat counters, a Chinese bakery, takeout section and general grocery section which had an organic aisle featuring a $10 bag of quinoa. 

I purchased some meat from the Halal section, since I'm kind of disturbed by the conventional meat industry right now. The guy gave me some recommendations based on freshness, which was very nice. 

I was able to get most everything on my list at a decent price (No Frills level pricing) except for quinoa (again, $10?!). This is particularly useful for me since I tend to split up my shopping between No Frills and Asian markets in order to get the best bang for my buck.

Although their regular menu is quite on the pricey side the $25 after 9 menu is well worth it if you are looking to try some excellent steak dishes in the city. As for ambiance, Moishe's definitely has quite an amazing ambience. Very classy and takes you back in time with it's stupendous chandeliers and white linen table cloths. One quickly notices the striking difference in clientele between the before 9 p.m. crowd and after 9 p.m. crowd. The only catch with the after 9 p.m. menu for $25 is that the table must order a bottle of wine which is not too bad because they have specials on wines after 9 p.m. for only $50 a bottle. Now for the food, what can I say Moishe's definitely does live up to its reputation as serving some amazing steak. I had their grilled rib steak and it was truly delicious. I also had the Monte Carlo baked potato which was out of this world packed with flavor! The steak was grilled to Perfection and the combination of spices was simply mouth-watering. The $25 after 9 menu includes an entree main dish and tea and coffee. Desert is not included. If you want to order dessert I strongly recommend sharing as their dessert portions are really humongousty.I would definitely recommend this restaurant for all steak lovers. Although eating after 9 might seem late to some , it is still worth trying out at least once. I must not forget to mention that they serve their amazing famous pickles and coleslaw which the waiters graciously refill.

This is my 1st visit to the new location (to think of it, I can barely remember visiting the old location). It's closer for me coming from Uptown area, and parking is nowhere as crazy as Stonecrest - both are pluses. The place was packed on a Friday night, so even though we had a reservation, we had to wait just a little for a table.

Service overall was ok - our waitress was eager and enthusiastic (at times maybe a little too enthusiastic but I am not complaining). My friend and I ended up starting out the night with the Pulpo Gallego and Jamon y Manchego. I enjoyed the grilled octopus, thus it was a little under seasoned for my tastebuds. The serrano ham were good as well as the mangchego cheese, but you don't get much in an order. For both of the dishes to be priced at $10, the grilled octopus is definitely the better deal.

For entree we shared an order of Marbella. I never had squid ink pasta so I was excited about trying something new. This pasta dish was full of flavor without being too heavy. They were very kind to split the portion up in two for us, and my half was more than enough to fill me.

We ended the night with a slice of tres leches. They did have some very impressive looking options, all so gracefully presented on a silver tray for decision making. BUT there's no better option than tres leches.

In fairness, I arrived on a Saturday night at 8pm but I think a 45 minute wait is a bit much for sausages and beer. When I left just after 10pm, the lines were gone. Note to self - return later in the evening when I need a sausage fix. The restaurant does not really get overcrowded, the doorman indicated the problem is headcount and the max people allowed under the fire code.

The sausages are delicious and very filling. I tried the Bratwurst, Italian and Calabrese. All were excellent. I recommend getting everything on them - the combination of sauerkraut, jalapeños, Sauteed onions and sweet peppers. You get two free toppings and pay 25 cents for additional toppings

They have a broad variety of sausages including 4 vegetarian, 3 chicken / turkey selections and 9 ""game"" varieties (i.e. rabbit, kangaroo, duck and wild boar). I will experiment a little more on my next visit.

The fires are really good, some of the best. I had the duck fat fries and they were cooked perfectly. You can also select from up to 15 unique dipping sauces to accompany your fries.

Now for my favourite part - the excellent beer menu. They had CDN craft brews from Beau's, Charlevoix Dominus, Hopfenstark, Dieu du Ciel, Nickel Brook and Sawdust city. Also a large number of international selections. Enjoying a beer at Wvrst and the associated atmosphere reminded me of the many German beer halls I have visited in the past.  For those who don't like beer (I have no idea why!), they offer a few wines. 

FYI - Tables are communal style - not great if you want a quiet conversation but cool if you want to meet some new people.

I will be back... but not if I have to wait 45 minutes to get in.

Our group ordered calamari (very good), potstickers (good) and wings (terrible - tiny and no flavour!) to start. The wings were really bad, deep fried and lightly breaded with absolutely no flavour!

I'm still trying to figure out if there's an optimal time to go lol.

I'd recommend getting the canica combo which comes with 4 chicken tenders, a slice of buttered bread, coleslaw, and one serving of their special sauce. If you hate coleslaw with a passion as much as I do, then you can opt for extra (soggy?) fries, sauce, or bread. Their ice tea is also a hit or miss. Sometimes it can be the most refreshing drink ever or it can be like a sugar bomb (even when mixing the unsweetened tea with the sweetened tea).

Me and my cousin ventured to this place in the 168 Market shopping center (across the street from China Mama). I was surprised by the store front sign only being in Chinese and Korean with no English on it and headed on in. The place was not very busy but the owner greeted us warmly into a modestly decorated dining area with light green walls and several pictures of various nature type scenes. My cousin was craving Cha Chiang Mein (Jajangmyeon). He's been inquiring all week where he could find this dish and thats what led us here. We ordered the Cha Chiang Mein ($6.25) Kim Che fried rice ($6.95), Mongolian Beef ($12.95) and the Fried Dumplings(8 pcs. for $6.95) (AKA Wor Tiep, pot-stickers or Gyoza). 
The Cha Chiang Mein (http://tinyurl.com/2d8lbnq) is nothing to look at consisting of a black bean paste (nearly-really black) sauce over noodles with some veggies and pork but was very tasty similar to a Hoisin flavor.
Everything was very delicious and was priced reasonably, about $35 for the two of us. I'll probably be back if the cousin wants the noodles again or try the other types of dumplings.

After dinner speaking to the owner they are Chinese who grew up in Korea which points to some of Korean influences and Shandong is a province near Korea as well.

Pros: Quick service, the dumplings are huge and handmade.
Cons: I want my Mongolian beef spicy hot, I'm unsure why everywhere I go now its just a sweet stir-fry of beef.

It feels like outdoors, complete with an Astra turf bocce ball course, but its enclosed and air conditioned, perfect for Arizona and my marriage. 
Our server was friendly, ready with suggestions, timely. We shared a bottle of wine, I think bottles were 1/2 off or something like that, great deal. I had the flat bread pizza with tandoori chicken, it was great, and the boy had vigazz burger, which he was impressed with, so much so that we returned a week later for $5 burgers.

I have been to a few events at the Grand Garden; more Ultimate Fighting Championship than anything else, but it's all the same in the end. It's a small arena with terrible acoustics and specifically old, wretched ushers that seem to hate the type of events that I go to and definitely show it when they interact with event-goers.  

Events I attended here:
- UFC® 66 
- UFC® 91
- UFC® 92 
- UFC® 98 
- Dave Matthews Band/The Fray
- The Police/Fiction Plane
- iHeartRadio Festival 2011 & 2012
- Lady Gaga: Born This Way Ball night one & two

The concession food is terrible. Exorbitant prices for crap food, of course; if you think Staples Centre food is bad, don't expect much here. 

Storytime ...
There is this especially deadpan, never-looking-interested-or-remotely-happy usher that works the FLOOR; she is a middle-aged Asian and if you go to many MGM events you will see who I mean. I thought she was going to strangle this little Japanese kid during Lady Gaga's set because he happened to be enjoying some of the thousand balloons that rained down from the rafters. Maybe she just particularly dislikes Lady Gaga or someone earlier was rude to her, but as far as I have seen the attitude is not exclusive to this usher. A lot of ushers sorta seem displeased with ushering. So back to the angry Asian usher, she was blocking the aisle way on the floor to ensure people did not move up during Gaga's set, which is conventional at overly uptight venues, but the problem was that some people were trying to leave early and she blocking their way out. And some people were also trying to get back to their seats after going to the restrooms or wherever else they were. - E",2012-12-22 22:55:43

Walking into this restaurant, you get a whiff of fish sauce right away, and servers busily pushing carts they use to deliver your order. It feels a little disorderly, and minimal efforts are put into the store decor. There are plenty of seating available, even for bigger groups.

The noodles served here are a little from the other Vietnamese restaurants. Here, the rice noodles are thick; I'd say 4 times thicker than the usual. As a result, it's harder to slurp, making the eating experience less satisfying even though each bite is more filling. The soup base is pretty good, beef ball just very slightly fatty, and tripe has a good crunch. The raw beef is a little tougher, maybe because it's not as thinly sliced, or they pre-cooked it a little too much. 

I really like the spring rolls here. Perfect crunch on the outside, good mix of meat and taro on the inside, great texture contrast against the hot bowl of soup.

My only complaint about this place as opposed to other self-serve yogurt joints is that they come around the counter and get the sample size for you as opposed to leaving the sample cups out.  I guess that makes it better for them when ""customers"" come in, sample everything as much as they want and leave, but for the real customers it's a little intrusive to the whole ""diy"" process.

I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house.  I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. 

Fast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.  We enjoyed the prix-fixe brunch, and enjoy it we did!  The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits.  The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.  My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage).  In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without.  A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries.  My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied.  So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again.  I'm so very glad I did!

I think it could use more duck too.. I could hardly see around the fries and sometimes I'm like is it crunchy fries or is it duck? I gotta say though, the fries tasted really good and the crust was good. It's just the whole thing was too much for dinner.

The pork shoulder was raved about by the hostess. Two of my guests ordered it, one finished, one did not. Looks to be a toss up.

The service was good though, she as so nice and informative. She raved about everything but then offered her own opinion which is what I'd prefer. She came around when we needed.

I think I need to try more of the food to really say whether this is good or not. It's probably standard fare.",2012-10-22 02:46:07

I've been here only once and it's beyond memorable: It was a late night saturday around 2am and my two friends and I were on a search for late night foods. Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a ""quiet, low key, good food atmosphere"" which was much preferable of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.

We seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants [""REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????"" - yup pronounced that way]

Anyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.

Needless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, we were lucky enough not to be involved in this altercation. 

All together this was a great late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!! Can't wait for the next visit.",2015-02-10 22:06:47

I asked him what he thought about the hinge (there was a comparable computer with the same type of hinge, Sony I think?) and whether it would be covered under warranty and how he thinks it will hold up.

Since moving here 3 months ago, I've been craving carne asada fries for so long but just didnt know where find one here in Vegas. Then one day making a wrong turn, I bumped into Roberto's Taco Shop which was 2 blocks away from my house.  My life just took a step up in being satisfied.

They are not selfish with their servings here. I ordered a carne asada fries and burrito and let me tell you, they did not miss even a millimeter of space in that box!  Not only were the servings big, but it was pretty good too.  Man that hit the spot! Best thing is that they're open 24/7 and I hit the gym around 1am so this is the new spot I will definitely be hitting up after my workouts.  Yea I know its a bad diet but I'll work out even harder to make up for it.

Service here is nice and very clean environment. From what I've been reading on yelp that other Roberto places arent as nice as this one.  Best thing is it's mexicans making mexican food unlike another place i went to where it was asians making mexican food and the other way around.  Biggest fail was a Pho restaurant ran by filipinos and let me tell you, their Pho was Phocking nasty! Keep the menu within the race and you get my thumbs up.

The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. 

I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good. 

If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks.

At 11 AM of a Saturday the place had a line outside. The wait took 10-15 minutes - we were a couple so they seated us before some larger crowds.

We ordered two sets of pancakes and two breakfast sandwiches; after checking out other orders come out of the kitchen, we regretted that: the portions were HUMONGOUS. I was used to IHOP's pancake order which consists of three small ones; they get you five huge-ass pancakes.

It took a little while to get our orders done, after all, the place was packed. The sandwiches were good and their pancakes were delicious - soft and tasty and went great with their maple syrup and whipped cream.

The room is small (10-15 tables inside, 3-5 outside). It's decorated with a bunch of little things such as jars of jam, bottles of maple syrup, and little price tags on them probably meant you could buy anything you liked.

Sweet Poke the concept is not much different then other Poke restaurants. It build your own style either bowl or burrito action. Or you can order from one off the menu. I ended up going with the 808 bowl for my first time. It combination of spicy tuna and tuna. If ur a fan of tuna this is the one would want to get if picking from the menu. The base I went with White Rice (Chips, Brown Rice, Salad, Organic Tofu, Half-Half), Protein since menu got two different tuna (Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cooked Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Scallop, Shrimp, Unagi), and the topping get choose (Crab, Spicy Tuna). The last step the Sauces (Chipotle Mayo, Eel Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, Ginger Shoyu, Wasabi Yuzu, Sweet Poke House Sauce, Creamy Japapeno, Yum Yum Sauce, Creamy Ceviche, Red Anticucho Sauce, Sesame Shoyu). So there definitely not a shortage of options or whatever your Poke combination desires! 

The bowls come in either reg or large. I went with the large bowl. Talk about LOT of food. The price for the most part is the same at all the Poke places checked out in Vegas. Some feel not get as much but at Sweet Poke get your money worth. They ask if want furikake on your rice. It might be only 808 thing but not many Poke places offer extra treat on top of your rice. I got bed of lettuce on top of the rice then started putting together the bowl. The tuna believe had the sweet poke house sauce. It had mayo base and super ono. Talk about nice size pieces of tuna. I have this rule with Poke. To start freshness is EVERYTHING and Sweet Poke least for the both tuna (my first visit trust me many more..) fresh, delicious, and legit style 808 poke. Second the cut of the tuna tells me whether they know meaning of Poke. I hate seeing minced tuna pan off as Poke. It should be decent size diced cubes of fresh fish. Sweet Poke it was right between nice diced but nothing tiny. The spicy tuna they just different style so not expecting it diced. Both tuna could just have bowl of each and be in Poke bliss. The toppings again not much different except always couple different ones see from one place to another. I loaded my bowl up with seaweed salad, edamame, cucumbers, and avacado. Lot more you can choose from so am sure something for everyone. Cucumbers, Edamame, and Avacado slices all nice and fresh!!! 

All the workers were awesome the whole time being my first visit. They explained everything clearly, and guiding me each step putting my bowl together. The whole staff super friendly. Really the minute walked in warm greeting, never rushed, and not doubt five star service. I love the interior. They have couple professional pictures of the food on the walls single shots. The minute walk in tell new building, new restaurant, and hell of clean just opened. Decent amount of places that can sit down eat unlike other spots.

I have to say the Pulled Pork Sandwich was my favourite. The meat is juicy and flavourful from the smoke. In terms of sides, I would go for the Home Fries. If you go, try the Sausage. It has that nice snap and with each bite you are getting a burst of flavour.

They just opened in June and as other reviewers have suggested, they have a few kinks to work out. It's not the typical dim sum where they come around with a cart. They give you a large picture menu and you check the box next to what you want. We were seated quickly but then no one came by to take our order. We had to basically ask someone walking past. She was friendly and helpful but it was a little odd. 

The dishes come out of the kitchen as they are prepared. Dishes came out mostly one at a time as there was quite a wait for our first dumplings. Not a good place to go if you are super hungry! 

On to what we ordered: The siu mai were the highlight. They did not skimp on the shrimp! The fried pork dumpling came highly recommended by our waitress but we found them quite oily. The pan-fried vegetable and pork buns were very tasty. The short rib with honey sauce had outstanding flavor but were mostly bone rather than meat. We also tried the baked creamy egg yolk bun per the waitress recs. This is something I never would have ordered otherwise and it was delicious!

Immediately on being seated we were brought a complimentary bread basket with absolutely amazing jalapeno corn bread, biscuits, and a cheesy garlic bread that was out of this world.  I ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around BSing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced.

For meals, my buddy ordered the Mesa Burger with Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion, and Horseradish Mustard on a House Roll with Southwest fries.....the burger was enormous and per his word ""awesome.""  I opted for the Thick Cut Ahi Tuna Nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas.  While it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu, I still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna I've yet to consume.  The portion was large and at only $11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread, nachos, soda, and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $15.

While this isn't ""5 star"" dining, it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice 'bar' setting when in Vegas.

Thank the lucky trolls my tickets were free! If I had paid for this atrocity, I would have been way passed pissed halfway to postal.

I can not believe this is related to X-burlesque the female revue version over at Flamingo hotel and casino. The X-burlesque women are fantastic, respectful and talented and put on a great show. I don't see them grabbing men's bozacks!

The men of X not so much. This is a low class bunch they have selected for the show.

There is a thin line with this show in which it could be considered sexual harrassment. I kid you not one of the male performer's slipped his hand up my skirt in one swift motion. It happened so fast I could not even react fast enough to stop what had just happened to me. He literally touched my panties he slid it up so far.

I went to see guys perform on stage NOT ON ME! I am sure there are many women out there in which this or incidents similar to it have happened, there is no way as brazin as this dude was that he has just done this to me and only me. 

Tacky, unprofessional, disrespectful and Hooter's beware you could eventually have a lawsuit on your hands from these lude performer's you have made contract with for this show. I will vent on Yelp and leave it at that.

  Yes, it's true, sometimes they don't do a perfect job but overall I think they do a pretty good job. I think some of the people that left bad reviews have unrealistic expectations. If you car is beat to sh*#, driving through a car wash isn't going to make it like brand new. Also, if you drive around with a pack of shaggy dogs in your car, I wouldn't expect them to spend 20-30 minutes getting all of the dog hair out. 
    Washing your car once every 6 months isn't going to get all of the sun baked dirt and insects off, expect to wash it several times over several days, it's a process, start with a somewhat clean car and the end result is even cleaner.
   When I point out  anything they miss they always gladly take care of it, They wash hundreds of cars each day and aren't robots.
   I also use the detail services regularly , I get my car hand waxed every 2-3 weeks, I get it polished every 30-60 days, get it clay barred every 6 months or so, and get it detailed every year. Again, sometimes they do a crappy job but overall I am satisfied. Some of the guys in the detail bay are excellent, some are meh.
 I used to use the oil change bay years ago but stopped because their prices are too damn high (more than the dealer), they stopped handing out discounts/coupons and some of the guys in the oil bays look pretty sketchy, If i'm going to pay a premium price, I'll have the dealer do it.

Like Noodles in Bellagio, expect to pay 2x to 3x the usual price in say Chinatown for noodle dishes.  Note they have a dual price structure - Caesars reward members get a buck off each dish or so.

I got the Dan Dan noodles with spring noodles and an order of six pan-seared pot stickers.  I got the wife the Shanghai-style wonton with shrimp and egg noodles.

Dan Dan noodles looked a bit light on sauce but it turned out to be a good ratio since it had some serious kick.  Very good noodles - round, smooth, and slightly chewy.  Pot Stickers were excellent - worth the 15 mins prep time since they were golf-ball sized with a single edge that was perfectly seared. The skin around the seared edge was soft, but it held the juicy pork-cabbage filling perfectly.  The dark sauce also had a nice spicy kick.

I  only took a nibble from my wife's dish and it was OK.  Definitely lighter mellow broth characteristic of Cantonese style.  The prawns and wontons in her bowl were huge!

But if you have the time for some context, then much obliged! I remember the old Bar Louie well. It's where Calico Jack's in Westgate currently resides. At the time, I'd just turned 21 and thought martinis were the key to adulthood. I have to keep reminding myself that these, and not beers, are Bar Louie's specialty. 

Which would work if there were more than a handful of them. And a few selections are eclectic and high quality, it's just that if you ever get the chance to see a real cocktail bar like Hanny's, you know having a few doesn't cut it.  It might be above-average for a chain, but the target audience still thinks slamming Absolut from fancy glasses makes them cool.

Anyways, I really want to rip on this place about beer. It's late Tuesday night, and no happy hour? That alone I could forgive, but $7 for LOCAL crafts...in 14 oz. glasses? Pints or GTFO. So now that you're losing to surrounding bars on selection AND value, let's talk about the atmosphere. 

Pick better live music. The description on Yelp says the music is ""background"", but these horrific covers of songs of alternative we're supposed to love were near rock-concert loud in a mostly empty lobby. No one likes having to yell when it's not even poppin'. 

If I go again, I'll try some grub and see if there's something from the spacious ambiance I've overlooked. But in value, selection, and atmosphere Bar Louie left me wanting a little bit more than it should.",2012-10-25 08:14:44

Its a restaurant with an adjoining grocery. Both the restaurant and the grocery are fantastic.

First the restaurant: Don't let the occasional sparseness of diners put you off. This place is great. I've probably had most of the stuff on the menu by now, but my regular order for years has been a bunch of appetizers (hummus, tabouleh, mixed pickles, eggplant salad - or just the combo salad) and as the main course - Siniyeh. Siniyeh is a great dish you can't get at too many places. It's basically a ground beef patty seasoned with middle eastern spices and covered in tahini sauce, pine nuts, and parsley, slow baked to perfection in the oven. It also comes in a tomato sauce variety,but i prefer the tahini one. The dish's in that category of the menu all come with a salad and your choice of one appetizer. So if you're going alone, don't order any of the other appetizers, it will be too much! and of course all the food is served with the best pitas you can get in north america (IMO).

the grocery: ok, best pitas in the GTA BY FAR. It is very hard to find this style of thick pocket pita anywhere and done correctly and super fresh almost anytime you go. The machine that churns them out is actually right behind the counter in the back where you order the takeout, and is pretty much spitting them out all the time. I make sure to buy as many bags as i can fit in my freezer whenever i go! Their hot sauce is also hard to beat.

Their wall menus could include more items and prices, and their restroom was missing paper towels.

I was a nervous little at first, but it's clear she's an old pro. She was very sweet, and it's clear that she wants the customers to like the food. We ordered General Tso's, Moo Shu Shrimp, and Hot and Sour Soup. I wouldn't call it the best food I've ever had, but it hits the spot when I'm craving Chinese food. The initial waitress was the owner's teenaged daughter and you can tell she's too cool for school. The owner's super nice though, she made sure to refill our water and stopped by several times to make sure everything tasted okay.

Hubs and I both got the pork banh mi and a bubble tea to share. The tea was more like thai ice tea and very delicious. Perfect for a hot day. The banh mi was delicious, loved the sweet sauce she used along with the pickled cauliflower. Perfect with the cilantros. 

We ordered and Lucy said to have a seat and she'll bring it to us. There is a picnic table that seats 6 near her stand. Once we were refreshed, tummies filled, we paid her. $17 in total, not bad at all.

Side note, I came across Lucy last year at a disastrous post wedding group brunch at Bar Marco. I hadn't realized the picnic table was Lucy's as the wait staff allowed us to sit there. (Makes me upset to think about that in retrospect and more negative points for them.) Anyhoos, we waited FOREVER (more like an hour plus) for our food. The aroma from Lucy's was so great and propelled our hunger. One of us caved and got a banh mi. He ate and was very happy. We all still sat there waiting and waiting for brunch.

The overall effect of nitrogen is to quickly cool the ice cream so no ice crystals form, resulting in a smoother ice cream. That it did, however it felt like they use milk as a base, and not cream -- so you didn't get that nice luxurious feel in your mouth. 

Taste wise, however, the MANGO POMELO taste is quite nice and comes with an injection of coconut milk, though where the pomelo actually is, I have no idea. The MATCHA original is quite strong in flavour and almost bitter. The OREO is not bad and comes with crumbles ontop.

More importantly, if you come dressed up as a cartoon character you get $1 off your lunch/dinner, 50% of any drink, and a free desert (this last time being a slice of tiramisu or strawberry moose cake). Follow their facebook page to know about that special, other ones, and daily food/drink/desert specials!

For entrees the wife ordered omurisu which I've had before. Omurise is an three egg omelette served on top of a mound of a tomato based chicken fried rice. Chef Kiichi tops it with a tomato puree.

I went for the curry chicken katsu. A simple plate of white rice, chicken katsu and Chef Kiichi's curry garnished with pickled beets. Japanese curry is different than Indian or Thai as it more closely resembles a spicy gravy. Kiichi's curry has a lot of flavor and a good amount of heat! They do have vegan friendly curry available for those who follow an animal free diet.

For desert I went with the tiramisu, served in a shallow bowl in a small pool of coffee which I spooned over the cake before each bite. The wife's strawberry moose cake was unbelievable. Light, tasted like strawberries without being heavy handed.

During dinner we talked with Chef Kiichi's wife about anime and my wife's pregnancy (they were speaking a mile-a-minute Japanese!). Everyone who works there is so friendly and warm. Absolutely love coming here.",2012-05-11 22:07:37

I had the Triple Lindy - which basically equates to the stuff you get on it, not the actual ingredients.  The black beans were good, cooked just right and plenty warm.  The steak was flavorful and tender.  Everything was proprietor well with no one item overwhelming the others.

I had the iced tea for a drink, and other than needing a lot of ice to make it cold, it was tasty - no sweetener needed (they also serve sweet tea if that's your thing.)  

The chips, as always were fresh and tasty, nice an thin, and not over salted.  The salsa had good flavor and was a good consistency, perhaps a little thinner than I personally prefer, but not bad.

These crunchy bits are not to be missed!! The warm creaminess of the lamb brains against the crunch of the proscuitto wrapping was sublime. Pig's blood pasta was simultaneously salty and spicy.

It's a wonderful fast food / casual eatery that focuses on serving a few meats in the variations of salad, bowl, plate, and wrap. Personally, I wouldn't think of baguette as a ""wrap"" holder per se, so I went with a wheat pita (there's also white) instead since it's more traditional.

I found the steak shawarma to be a little chewy. You'd think that it might be more tender with that roasting and thin slicing, but it wasn't. It also didn't carry quite as much flavor as I've had before in a shawarma, or even in a steak burrito. Maybe it wasn't marinated too well today? I was pretty hungry though, so it still hit the spot. I actually took the second half home to finish since it was that big, so it's quite a good deal for $6.45.

Meanwhile, the falafel is a steal at only $4.95. Same portion size, cheaper, more consistent texture. I have no doubt that it would have been spectacular with the crunchy texture and warm temperature if I had had it fresh, but it was still quite delicious when I bit into it cold for dinner.

The Mediterranean salad was a common element to both wraps, and while I took to most of the veggies readily, I'm gonna have to get used to the chickpeas being included whole since it's not something I've actually had in this type of food before.. The pickled carrots, which are a bit spicy, also help add some texture, but I'm not sure that the one small plastic amount was enough for my two wraps.

For now, a solid four stars. I'll probably reevaluate after I try some of the other meats, as well as some of the sauces that I'm reading about on Yelp.",2012-07-27 02:23:47

Half way through my massage I guess a few other people showed up for an appointment and I could hear everything through the paper thin walls so that really ruined my massage. I can't forget that before by appointment I had to wait outside as the door was locked. I usually come 10-15 mins before my scheduled appointment to fill in any paperwork, use the restroom etc so I can get my full hour in but up until 1:00pm no one was there and then out of no where a car pulls into the parking lot with their music blasting and a young girl jump out to open the door.

It is ""Modern Mexican"" so it's a lot different than the Mexican food most people know. There are no Quesadillas and burritos covered in mole sauce. They still have about 6 different types of guacamole ranging from traditional to smoked trout  guacamole which are all very good although they often need a little salt. They have salsas as well but they are flavorless and not worth getting. They make their chips fresh to order and are some of the best I've ever had. Momocho is known for their taquitos which consist of a meat, peppers and onions, two sauces, and small flour tortillas. They are phenomenal. I have been here several times and I can say with 100% certainty that the duck taquitos are the best. The wild boar taquitos are good as well. The shrimp taquitos aren't enough food and are not worth the money. I generally don't order dessert when I go out to eat but they're fried ice cream is amazing. Ordering this is a must. I'm not a big margarita and sangria guy but my girlfriend says they're great.

The steak was cooked perfectly (despite the cut being a little on the chewy side), and the accompanying onions-and-gorgonzola sauce was just about perfect.

Food was also mediocre at best. Some of the salmon ordered weren't fresh. Cuts of fish were super thin (slivers) atop plenty of rice. Rolls were cut huge, filled with more rice than tasty ingredients. Items that should be served hot were actually served cold; soup, tea, some cooked dishes. The distribution of seasoning was also uneven; extremely salty, too spicy or bland. It wasn't good. Short beef ribs = all fat, no meat & over the top salty. Curry = all heat, no flavour.

So, on a whim, we decided to try out this new Greek restaurant that I'd been nagging her about since I noticed that the renovation wrap had come down from the windows.

What a great idea! I truly amaze myself sometimes, I do.

We started off by sharing an order of saganaki, choosing the Kefalograviera over the Halloumi. It was wonderful, and I especially appreciated that the dish was not accompanied by a bevy of frantic wait-staff yelling Opa! Opa! then setting my food ablaze. Simplicity rules; and this dish needed no greek gyrations or Hellenic handstands to enhance the dish. This delicious fried melty cheese appetizer instead whispered to me that we were in good hands. Authentic hands. Hands from the Old Country that know that quality comes from the ingredients and preparation.

For the main, we ordered a bottle of Retsina, some chicken brochettes for the missus, and a plate of married sardines for myself. Honestly, I thought that ""married sardines"" was a typo and that they meant ""marinated sardines"" but no; these little sardines were sandwiched together then cooked with simple, tasty spices and served alongside grilled zucchini and a little bowl of mashed chickpeas (or something). The plate (see the photo I uploaded) reminded me of the fresh-from-the-sea sardines that I had had that one time in Paros so I was sublimely happy. 
The Missus's brochettes were also delicious. She let me have a tiny nibble and no more. You know things are good when the missus doesn't share!

I should also mention that I learned something that night too. I've been a fan of Retsina since the *cough-cough* twentieth century and I was delighted when the waitress suggested that I try the wine with a squirt of Pepsi. Seriously. I had never heard that Retsina could be drunk this way and the expression on my face showed it. However, being adventurous I took her up on it and tried it.  OPA!! adding Pepsi to Retsina wine turns it into a kind of Vermouthy aperitif! Amazeballs!! Best discovery ever!!

Desert? I wasn't hungry, but I knew that I wasn't ready to stop eating. I asked for the Loukoumades and was not disappointed. These light and fluffy deep-fried balls of happiness (think donut batter) were served piping hot and covered with a lovely sheen of greek honey. What a perfect way to end a meal.

My only negative comment on the evening would have to be about the chairs. They're not super comfy, but then again I completely stopped thinking about them the moment the food arrived.

Be aware that each toppings cost $0.85 while more premium toppings cost $1.25 each.

Nowhere does it say in the store on signature Bowl menu that toppings cost extra. Only on the build your bowl menu is  where it clearly states that toppings cost more.

They need to be more clear on this. Especially when signature bowls already cost so much money. Think about when you actually have to build your own bowl. It would cost an arm and a leg.

Service was average (typical Chinese restaurant service in Calgary)--the servers did only what they were required to do (bring food to the table and clear empty plates).  Even before the first dish arrived at our table, we had to walk to the bar to replace a dirty wine glass with a clean one (as it was still impossible to flag down a server).
 
Once the emcees made their introductions, the food started to come out fairly quickly.

1. House special combination cold platter:  duck, ham, jellied beef, sliced spiced jellyfish with cilantro garnish.  We're off to a good start here!
2. Scallops and abalone mushrooms with vegetables:  the whole dish was flavorful; the sugar snap peas were tender-crisp.  The addition of more carrots could have made the plate more colorful (apart from the green from the sugar snap peas, everything else was white and beige).  
3. Braised duck with taro:  this was an amazing dish!  The duck was tender and the sauce complimented the taro and duck perfectly(not too salty).   
4. Supreme crabmeat fishmaw soup:  there were generous portions of fishmaw and crabmeat in this soup.  Yum.
5. Creamy lobster with noodles:  ahhh, heaven...  There's nothing like the combination of fresh lobster, noodles, and cream sauce.  
6. Crispy chicken with onion in soy sauce: a delicious variation from the regular crispy chicken with shrimp chips.  The chicken meat was tender, but not as juicy as the chicken in Ho Won.
From here onwards, things started to go downhill...
 7. Stuffed bean curd with shrimp paste with vegetables: there was a substitution in the menu here.  We were served dow mew (pea shoots/greens) with whole garlic cloves.  A bit oily, but delicious!  Oiliness is nothing a good cup of tea can't fix.   
8.  Special steamed pickerel with ginger and green onion: what, no pickerel available?!?  The substitution was battered fried fish fillets (which tasted like basa, an inexpensive Vietnamese catfish) in a sweet and sour sauce. The fish was drowning in the batter (many customers left this dish unfinished).  Well, I guess I shouldn't complain much--it could have been tilapia...  
9.  Seafood and pineapple fried rice: rather uninspiring and utterly bland.  I would even go so far to say that the kitchen cut corners and diluted the dish with more rice.  It was mostly steamed white rice with hardly any seafood or pineapple in it.
10. Seasonal fruit and special cookies:  I'm not a big fan of Chinese desserts, but there was a very interesting pink marshmallow-like coconut jello (well, it tasted like a marshmallow, but not as sweet!) and fried cookies with sesame seeds (I would've preferred eating an almond cookie).

First of all this not your typical restaurant/bar. You have to order your food at one station and your drinks at another. Once you order your food you are given a number and the food gets delivered to you. You then have to go to the bar and order your drinks, so essentially you pay separately for both orders which is a bit of an inconvenience.
But Yelp is all about the food and that is why I am giving them 4 Stars. The slow cooked brisket is to die for and sides like a mac and cheese and their homemade coleslaw will compliment your meals. 
They have domestic and craft beers, and ciders available as well as a nice coctail menu. Service is a little slow here but I am guessing because its always very busy and the food is cooked to perfection.

My mom and I now visit this place every week for our weekly gorcery shopping. The fruits and veg are great and fresh, and because we love our berries so much (for the healthy shakes), they always have a special going on for these fruits. There are a couple of items we never have bought here and that is the meat (not the frozen kinds) and the seafood. I can't attest to them, but aside from the great fruits and veg, my mom always buys cheeses, deli meats (nitrate free!), and bread. 

The prepared foods are not bad either, as are the desserts. Everytime I pass by the cake section, the LARGE, RED VELVET cupcakes make me drool everytime. I have yet to give in to the temptation though!

There is a nice airy corner where you can enjoy coffee which is where my dad sometimes goes as the ladies decide on which cabbage to buy. And because this is a 905 area, there are no need to bring your own bags. As environmental as that is, sometimes you just forget.

Pad Thai was to die for! Medium is a perfect temp that allows for flavor not to get lost in the spiciness.

My boyfriend enjoyed his Tom Yum soup, as well as his mango sticky rice he took to go.

My best experience was when I went with a large group of people and shared multiple appetizers. Otherwise, I find the main dishes to be generally disappointing. They are not all that different from what you might find at other Asian restaurants (more generic Chinese than Malaysian).

Since 2008 or so, they also began to offer ""Hong Kong style dim sum.""  Although the selection is limited and the dishes taste like reheated frozen stuff, I welcomed the addition. A Sunday brunch at Sun Penang offers at least a pale imitation of the dim sum experience (they'll even wheel out one lonely steam cart), which is the best we can get in Pittsburgh for now. 

Of the dim sum items, I like: the stuffed eggplant. I also find that  the Malaysian sponge cake, the baos, and the shrimp dumplings are pretty robust to reheating. If you are ordering to-go, you can revive the egg custard in your toaster oven. I am disappointed by: the turnip cakes (I prefer Rose Tea's) and the congee (Ka Mei's is marginally better).

This place has been around for quite a while but it wasn't until our annual office Thanksgiving lunch this year that I finally checked it out. Well, the good thing, is, I loved it and I'm definitely going back to try some other menu items. 

It wasn't very crowded at lunch so we had the chance to look around and the place is really well done. I love the funky decorations and would even be comfortable coming back and eating at the round bar by myself. 

After looking at other Yelp reviews I had to try the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. Growing up eating morels as a regular dish at my grandparents' house in Michigan I still have trouble thinking of them as an ""exotic"" mushroom, but considering the price they sell for in the stores, I guess they are. The other types of mushrooms included portobello, shiitake, cremini, button, and others. You could definitely taste all the different types and they went extremely well with the polenta cakes. 

Others in my party tried the pastrami, ham & cheese miraviglioso, chicken and waffle sandwich, and the west coast wrap. While I didn't try any samples, everyone was raving about their food.

I'm definitely going back to try the Burger 2.0 which is described as ground buffalo stuffed with duck confit and the Berkshire Pork Belly from the appetizers menu.

Cowboy Ciao definitely gets my vote as a great place to go.",2013-11-28 03:10:58

I haven't written a review in a long time but thought this was worth mentioning.

When I got there, they had 6 of the 8 flavors remaining. I bought double orders of them all. They cost $2.5 each. Okay, I know what your thinking. I'm not a pig, I like to share...sharing is caring even if it's out of my pocket. My coworkers aren't foodie like myself. So they adventure thru me. I'm not going to lie I ate 3 out of 12 :)

I have admit, other than Omei's mango mochi. Sasaki  Bakery's is the bomb dot com!

Once I bite into the mochi, I knew right away that premium ingredients were use. The softness/viscoelasticity of the gel consistency was the results of japonica glutinous rice and proper pounding of the dough. Not your typical glutinous rice that people use for sticky rice. All the mochi had the same red bean filling and cream flavor of your choosing. All the mochi blended well with red bean filling. My favorite was  matacha but I didn't get the chance to try chestnut, strawberry and sesame cause my coworkers had those. The 9 coworkers that tried was all 1st timers, never heard of mochi but thought it was a Chinese dessert by association. Let's just say, they loved it! 

I'm not a fan of desserts because I watch what I eat but I know mochi is perfect when I'm craving for sugar. It's low-calorie, low-fat rice cake with the right amount of sweetness that didn't over power my palette.

The size of the mochi was perfect for 2 bites, depending on how you eat it. Guys will probably eat it as a whole but you should take a small/half bite to savor the ingredients.

The stores at J-Town are hidden if you're not familiar with the area. They don't use loud/large banners. Once you're parked, walk towards the yellow tarp/tent that says ""J-Town."" Than, walk straight ahead, near to the end. It'll be on your right. The signage is white and on the wall next to the door. Keep in mind Japanese stores normally closed on Mondays. Make sure to check the schedule. 

I ordered mine to go, it was nicely packaged in a container and placed in a paper bag with the Bakery's logo in the middle. I liked that the packaging is environment friendly where you can recycle everything when  your done.",2016-10-08 18:29:31

From the time we parked and had to pay $5 for self parking. Which you get back from the casino cashier. I was in shock. Been to Vegas so many times and never had I ever paid for parking until now. I noticed this is common practice among the downtown hotels. Others make you get a ticket and validate.

The parking garage is tight and space is hard to find. Check-in was quite interesting since the guy at the counter seemed uninterested in checking people in. Got our keys and headed to our room. As soon as we got in our room I had a flashback of the days I had once checked in a Days Inn or a Motel 6. It's old and the carpet is starting to peel off the wall. The bathroom ceiling was sagging and the tub was stained. So much for getting a good value in Vegas. I have booked a hotel in the pits. This place is dilapidated the knobs on the sinks dont even turn off all the way.

I also noticed the tv needed a little updating. Reminds me of circa 80s with a 20"" tube tv. Reception was sketchy. I was trying to look for the rabbit ears but I guess they have cable here (joke). Anyways the following morning, I needed to iron my clothes and noticed the iron has been permanently latched onto the board with a retractable plastic string contraption. They also forgot to attach the dryer on the wall coz i noticed it on top of the shelf. 

I can't really complain much since I only had 10 minutes to book a room prior to us driving from LA to Vegas at around 8PM. Most of the hotels in downtown are charging an arm and a leg for last minute and all the while I thought I got a good deal. Hahahaha.  

The only good part is it's located right smack in the middle of downtown and you just cross the street to the 'Freemont Experience"" and jump from one casino to the other. You won't catch me staying here again that's for sure. So if your looking for an experience like you've never had. Come check it out like the other suckers like me.",2009-06-30 21:33:08

Dinner with fellow Yelpers, Judd and Lynn L., put this place on my bookmarks and it was about time to pay them a visit. With two other Greek food lovers in toe, we came out to try as much as possible. One Mezze Plate, Two Beef Slouvaki Plates, two fountain drink, one bottled water, Rice Pudding, a Baklava, and two secret Greek Coffees (explanation later on) cost a little under $50. There was even left over after I tried to cram as much in as possible. As I write, I lay in bed in a semi-comatose state. 

The Mezze Plate is a combination of vegetarian favorites; spanakopita, two dolmas, hummus, pita bread, tsaziki sauce, and two falafels. The puffed pastry was flaky, buttery, and filled with spinach and cheese. The falafels were crispy on the outside and light inside creating the perfect combination. The Slouvaki Plate boasted the most tender and juicy beef. They were drool worthy at medium rare and the juices oozed into the rice. Taste bud overload! With the second plate there is an option to pick between three different sides; rice, fries, and Greek salad. The gentleman behind the register gave us all salads on top of one rice and one order fries. The guest service is amazingly friendly. We were continuously checked upon during dinner as well. 

After our meal, one of my friends pushed me to ask about coffee. It is not listed on the menu, but it could not hurt to ask. The same guy who took our order made a joke that it was on their secret menu and it was no problem to make. Now to desserts! The Rice Pudding is thick and rich. The Baklava had great depth and not too sweet. They are definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. On the way out, we even got a warm farewell.

This pocket gem can be hard to find and I was finally notified of its existence when my co-workers suggested it for lunch.

My favorite parts of a Korean meal are the complimentary banchan plates and hot tea and this place delivered. The standard kimchi, sprouts, and pickled cucumbers tasted sour and ""fresh"". Surprises included tasty diced franks sautéed with onions; boiled peanuts; steamed broccoli; and salty, dried tiny fish. But don't expect all of this in one meal. Every visit yielded different banchan plates and that's totally fine in my book. 

The signature bibimbap was executed very well. It's served hot and the medley of diced vegetables, sliced steak, steamed rice, and a fried egg came out perfectly like Kim Yuna landing a triple lutz. The serving size is ridiculously generous and I NEVER finished.  It's served two ways: regular bowl ($8.95) and hot spot ($9.95). I personally liked the regular bowl better because the hot pot can turn the rice super crispy and that those little suckers will get stuck in your molars.

On parle ici d'un pain kaiser aplati (d'une catégorie difficile à décrire) à l'intérieur duquel vous trouverez quelques minces tranches de "" baloney "" accompagné d'une lichette de moutarde jaune.

I have officially decided I am never going back here again. I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.
It's that bad.
Not only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:
1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.
2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!
3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.
4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!
5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.
6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.
7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be ""checked out"" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.
8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.

Oh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.
If Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.
It's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.

I've been to it about 8 times in the past year and have never been disappointed nor have my guests.  The menu and prices are pretty much typical of family oriented mex restaurants but the food is above average and pretty consistent.  The very first time we visited, soon after it opened, one of the co-owners came by and talked to us.  From what he said it's one of several restaurants owned by his family who are headquartered in TX (I think that's where he said).

One thing people need to know about ""Garcia's"" chain is that they are NOT all alike.  Some are definitely better than others.  The original Garcia's is at 35th Ave near McDowell Rd in Phx and while popular the food at the original is sub-par.  So don't let your experience at another one prevent you from trying this one.

I generally get a green burro and that's what I've gotten here.  And it's very good.  My wife usually gets a red burro and is very happy with those.  The meat is in chunks and usually there is plenty of it.  The gravy it swims in is good.  The only knock I have about the green burro is that the green chilies in the mix, like so many mex restaurants, is a bit overcooked.  Others in our party had fajitas and thought they were  very good.

There chips are above average and they serve a decent salsa and a bean dip with the chips.  The bean dip is tasty.  The service has been good to excellent.  The other restaurant I recommend in the tempe/mesa area is Rosita's.  There is also a Rosita's in Phx but it's different people.  The one in Phx is also good but the food there is MUCH hotter, usually too hot for out of town folks who have never had what we here call ""real mexican food"".",2014-07-16 16:46:10

It was not too shabby. Had a lot of fresh mangos on top and in the middle of the ice cream cup. The only thing is the N2 made it feel a little frozen and I personally found it a little too sweet. They give you a syringe on top of the ice cream if you wanted more mango syrup in your ice cream.

Love the concept and the ice cream feels like it's made of milk.

Didn't buy any drinks (like a $3 Coke/soda) since I had water. That should be enough, right? 

But holy shitsnacks! I should've ordered it with a carton of milk because the amount of wasabi in those things was enough to burn me a whole new breathing hole. It got to the point where I was choking on the wasabi, and only the relief of a milky, cold ice capp could bring mediocre relief to my burning sinuses. I was surprised, in picking a piece apart, to find that it wasn't much more than a small smear inside each piece. However, those smears were enough to hold the wasabi power level of wasabi peas x 10-15 times what you get from those snacks. What fresh hell is this? Yes, yes, they probably use the real wasabi stuff which has actual depth of flavour, quality, etc. but the amount of it was just too much. 

True that the fish seemed fresh. Rice was nicely vinegared to compliment the fish. But I don't think I'll ever be able to return, on the basis of I like not having my sinuses on fire, thank you very much.",2016-05-25 01:19:26

Honestly, if you are looking for a nice place that just seems ""dive-y"", check out Shady's. This is no place to take a lady.

And boy, do some people get into that.

Anyway, I've seen people in here who looked like they had nothing to lose and somewhat acted the part. I've also seen people who reminded me that true wealth lies elsewhere than in a lease on a new BMW. Happy, secure people who knew themselves and were just living life one SSI check at a time.

This place turned out to be terrible. To start off, they don't have enough color choices. They didn't have the color I wanted but they had something close so I settled for it. I told the girl that I had to go to a wedding so she would be careful. Wrong. She f***ed up my nails. First she cut them too short, on top of that she cut them crooked so she had to file them down even shorter. Speaking of filing, she didn't even smooth them out. I had to file them myself when I got home so they wouldn't have jagged edges and get caught in socks and clothes. To make it worse she got polish all over my cuticles. My nails looked hideous! I should have posted a photo but I was too upset with the whole experience. I was not even escorted to the drying station. I just put my flip flops on myself, walked to the drying station, pulled up a chair and turned on the UV and fans myself. I'm so pissed off I went to this place! I almost felt cheated out of my money for a sub par job that I would have done way better if I had done my nails myself!

Update: The owner of this place commented saying that they have over 1000 colors and that the girl who did my nails, it was her last day so she slacked off.
However, the comment does not make sense to me. Firstly, I wanted a pearly white. That's like one of the basic colors a nail salon is expected to carry. Heck, I even have it in my nail polish set at home, and I only have 5 basic colors! It's not like I wanted some fancy color that your 1000 shades could not satisfy.
Secondly, she said it was the girl's last day so she slacked off, but I did not mention her name, neither did I describe what she looked like, so how are they sure which girl I'm talking about? Besides, it wasn't just about how she did my nails. More than one employee saw me walk over to the drying station and turn on fans and UV lights on my own, but no one thought of helping out. It's the attitude that stinks. I'll just consider my $16 down the drain but there are plenty of good nail salons around the area that have good and courteous service and people that don't try to make excuses for their poor service.

We ordered one pizza with mozzarella, provolone, salami (which is basically pepperoni), and basil. They make a lovely wood-fired crust, and the ingredients were fresh and superb. This is a pizza reminiscent of Cibo or Parlor, but not as expensive (but it starts to add up with the toppings, so beware).

We also ordered a two-cheese appetizer, with bufalo and smoked mozzarella, both of which were very tasty. They came with ample grilled/marinated peppers, zucchini, and eggplant, most of which I piled on to my pizza. 

My only complaint was that the appetizer was kind of messy to eat and it seemed like a good crusty bread would be a natural accompaniment.

The concept is cool: custom ice cream sandwiches. You can pick cookies, brownies, donut or a combo to be the top and bottom of your sandwich. Then pick an ice cream flavor and topping if desired. 

Considering I always seem to be making a mess when I eat, no matter how hard I try, I decided the classic sandwich was a recipe for disaster. I opted for the much easier to eat brownie bowl, where you get a brownie and then add your ice cream and toppings on top. I got espresso ice cream and sprinkles. I believe you can also get a cookie bowl. 

The scoop of ice cream was huge. For $6.50 it was a good size and I thought worth it. My partner got the same except with vanilla ice cream, and she really enjoyed the brownie.

It's a weird thing, but sometimes I like to just head to liquor stores to peruse all the fine wines, the imported liquors, and the vast variety of bottles that are out on the market. 

I stumbled into this Liquor store over the weekend when I was in a crunch to pick up some wine and head over to a friend's place. 

I am not exaggerating when I say this place is AMAZING! I haven't seen selection like this since being back in Ontario! 

The bad news - I ended up being late to my friend's get-together because there was SO many different types of liquor to look at!!! The good news - I brought a bottle of liquor that people thought was unavailable in Calgary!

It's a pretty dark space, heavily style with an island flair...both in decor and menu. The menu is pretty small, but all of the items that I've tried have been pretty good, and the service has always been really good, whether sitting inside or outside.

We absolutely love their black bean dip, but fair warning: it's pretty spicy if you're not good with heat. The burger is good, as well as the cuban sandwich, but my go-to is probably the fish tacos. I tend to think they overdo it on the cream sauce, but otherwise, they're excellent. The red sangria is also delicious! I wouldn't say the food will blow you away, but I doubt you'll be disappointed, either.

It's warm vibe and good service means it's good for both casual meals and for a nice date night spot. The strip district can be insane at times, so while you may have luck grabbing a table or seats at the bar on a whim, I'd advice making a reservation to save yourself a wait.

kheaZsXL5aJpLun0WhqqxA,i6nzTfZ8TRckJOGgZIpr5Q,VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,3,1,0,0,"This place is just OK--I think there's a huge difference between coming here for happy hour and wasting money and time otherwise. The happy hour deals--half off margaritas and $1 off tacos--really help the appreciation for the otherwise lackluster...everything, if you ask me.

The tacos are kind of a crap shoot, as they're mostly up to the customer and if one doesn't taste good, it's probably your fault. But, the quality of ingredients and assembly also play a part. I can say that the Coca Cola marinated steak is fantastic, but that's really the only impressive part of the menu. Better yet, just stick to the chips and salsa. The salsa is actually delicious and probably the only redeeming factor here--the guacamole was pretty meh and the queso was just queso, kind of hard to mess that up. Also, a huge problem--for my husband, not me so much--is the lack of soft corn shells. He's all about traditional tacos (think La Plaza) and he was hoping to mirror some of their options one night, but ended up without a soft corn option. We discovered that they have suggested tacos with soft corn shells, but they're just not on the regular menu. I imagine if you ask for those specifically, they'd make your taco with them...hopefully. 

The El Diablo margarita is probably the best cocktail here, but beware any mixed drinks. We witnessed a large amount of watering down from one bartender. He didn't measure things and to make up for it, ended up just tossing a bunch of soda water into cocktails. But, that's only if you get a chance to put an order in. The service is a tad slow, but I can't blame them too much, because it gets pretty busy here after typical office hours. 

Not my favorite place, but not the worst. I'll probably never turn down a $3.50 margarita during happy hour, but otherwise, it's just not worth it.",2015-02-22 00:25:30

As I previously stated, I have been trying to book my honeymoon trip to Whistler, BC and was hoping to do so with the help of AAA. When my first attempt to go in and meet with a travel agent failed miserably, I was contacted on Yelp by Denise L. I have to give props to a company who goes out of their way to fix a situation. Denise L. took the time to write me a public owner comment and a private message asking me to contact her (or her coworker, Emily H.) regarding my negative experience. That is always nice. 

Because I love having AAA, my family has always had great experiences, and I just really needed some help planning this honeymoon of ours I decided to go ahead and call them. Emily H. was incredibly helpful over the phone. She, herself, was not able to plan a trip for me, but she asked me every question in the book in hopes of finding a travel agent who could get the job done. Emily asked what kind of room we wanted, where we wanted to stay in town, how much money we wanted to spend, gave helpful info regarding flights and transportation, etc. etc. etc. She was really great and for that I have added one star to my original review. 

Unfortunately, I never really got the help I was looking for after that. The travel agent who was assigned to my trip requests did her job, but it was not what I was hoping for. She called when I was told she would which was appreciated. But the info she provided me with over the phone was lacking any helpful detail and once again I was given flight prices that were much higher than what I could find on my own. Weird. I asked her to email me some of the accommodations that she had found so I could see pictures and prices. I received an email not too long after that, but it provided very little information and no links or photos. I'm sorry, but I am not willing to book a hotel if I have not even seen what the place looks like. She provided me with two accommodation options, both of which I could have easily found on my own. What's the point in having AAA book your trip if you can find the same options yourself? 

After this final phone call and email I am left wondering if maybe I expected too much from AAA's travel department. In this day and age it is probably easier to use the internet and do the research yourself. I certainly found better deals on my own and it saved me the hassle of trying to continue to communicate with different travel agents.

This new 3B is not only dinge-free but is quite pretty! It's an impressive, bright and open space with lots of natural light--and being PATH-accessible, it's nice for winter lunches since I am sure most people working in this area miss out on sunlight for most of the work week when the days are short, but wouldn't want to deal with the hassle of bundling up and being cold mid-day.

Three Brewers focuses on beer and the type of food you want to soak up your beer before heading back to work.

They have a few healthy options and some more nutritious entrees (salmon with rice, etc.), although if you have dietary restrictions it's not the best choice.

Alright, so when I saw the duck poutine pizza, I knew I had to get it. I came here with one other friend and had to wait a few minutes for a table to clear up, but that was no big deal. The pizza itself could likely serve more than two people (but we weren't too hungry that night, so we could be misjudging). It looked a decent size with heaps of poutine on top. The thin crust made it harder to cut without making a mess out of the entire thing, but we somehow managed.
First bite was great. It was delicious! As we ate more though, I really that the crust really did not compliment the poutine at all. The thin crust was so thin and dry that parts of it were burnt and flaking off. You could barely hold onto a piece without it disintegrating in your hand. We ended up picking out parts of the poutine to eat first so our entire dish wouldn't collapse on itself. The fries for the poutine weren't all that great either. Duck was good though. My friend and I ended up bringing leftovers home since we didn't want any food to go to waste.
I think that if the duck poutine pizza could be improved, then you'd have to make the poutine less traditional and to change the crust. The shape of the fries dumped on top of the ultra thin crust just did not work very well and was very messy to eat. Using a slightly thicker crust and instead of having regular fries, maybe using something flatter could improve the execution. Anyway, I'm not a chef by any means, but these are just my thoughts and opinions after dining at Bannock. 

The restaurant is not very big, and I was put into a corner beside people on an obvious Tinder date. It was quite cramped, and I could hear their entire conversation since I was almost thigh to thigh with one of them. 

It pains me to give this place such a low rating, because I thought I'd really like it. Alas, the only saving grace of the night was the service and my company. Everything else was meh.",2016-12-29 08:43:15

A little pricier than I thought, however the drinks (except alcohol) are included. Very typical as compare to Mandarin chain, with the kids play area as exception.

The first time was a friend's daughter birthday. Plenty of room for large parties and other clients. My wife did not find their sashimi fresh enough and my little 2 yrs old picked up on it too. It could also be the kids playroom that distracted them from eating, because of this room, we as  parent had to spend some times watching the kids. Other kids were very rude and physical, to the point of injuring themselves and other. Very filthy in this room as kids brought in food there as well.

The freshly pick your own fish, chicken or beef line was quite busy and very tasty. The dim sum section was OK not dim sum restaurant quality. Dessert was pretty good and fair size in selection as well. The kids definitely love this dept.

Our second visit was for my birthday, meal service was starting off great. Till I went to get the chicken skewers for my 2 yrs old. Luckily the kids wanted to play and it was my turn to watch them. My wife started to ingest the chicken then bit into a string of sheet metal. When we brought it to the waiting staffs' attention, the waiting staff was not very apologetic. The manager vow to investigate right away and came back with the reasoning that cooking staffs wore these steel gloves to protect themselves when putting the chicken on the skewers and this could be how that sheet metal string must have got caught in the food. Luckily, it is not my daughter that swallow it, nor did my wife cut her gums when she chewed the chicken. What was disappointing was they offered us two little glow in the dark dolphins for my kids and priced my wife's meal as children fare which is about 40% off. This incident really ruined my brother appetite and ended his meal then at only 2 plates of food ( he avg 4-6 plates). We have not been back there since July. I am not sure if we will. We told this incident to all our friends which is about 50 or so, everyone said we should have demanded free meal for her or me as it is a birthday celebration being ruined.

We were seated on the patio which is a large, spacious area. It was chilly last night but the patio was warm and inviting. The only draw-back is that it's...dark. Very dark. Had a hard time reading the menu much less seeing what they placed in front of us but the taste of the food was inviting enough for me to come back in the day-light to get the full effect.

We had the loaded chips to start. They are FANTASTIC. The housemade chips are perfectly crunchy and not greasy or oily at all. The carmelized onion, bacon, blue cheese, were all terrific. I am not sure if the chipotle crema was on there, I didn't taste it and had it been served in a better lit area, I'd know better if it was on there or not.  What I will say is that the loaded chips are a MUST HAVE appetizer because they were phenomenal. 

My boy had the crab cake BLT for his main. It was very tasty, served on a roll with perfect fresh veggies. The crab cake was perfectly done...not too moist, not too bready. The french fries that he chose for the side dish were not anything special at all. They were typical shoestring fries that I'm pretty sure were frozen and weren't well seasoned at all. They had salt, but for a place that prides itself with fresh house-made food, I was surprised by the lack of creativity with the fries.

I had the soup and salad combo. The soup was a loaded potato soup which was pretty nice. The broth was nice. Nothing special, but had a nice velvety finish which I like. The bacon was yum but I think it might have been missing cheese or something. It just tasted like something was missing. I wish I could say what. I added pepper but that wasn't it. It was salty from the bacon but not overly so. The salad was the chopped salad which was tasty. The hard boiled egg was way way too salty though. The ranch dressing was nice though and the avocado was fresh and firm. 

Our server was thorough but not terribly engaging. It's always been kind of hit or miss with the trendy servers at Postinos so I didn't expect Windsor to be much different. The decor is fun and I loved the wall of cassette tapes. Awesome conversation piece. Bathrooms are very similar to Postinos But unlike it's cousin, Windsor is not yet a 5-star place. It's got potential but it's not quite there. I'll definitely be back because they had a lot of very intriguing menu choices and those loaded chips are worth the price of admission all on its own. 

Oh and one other note...like it's cousin, parking at Windsor is also a pain in the ass. Keep this in mind and definitely do the valet. It'll save you a lot of aggravation.",2012-12-15 18:05:48

Located not too far off the 215 from S. Rainbow, you can find this establishment in the Albertson parking lot on the left by the haircut place. 

Setting: Keep it open and free of cluttered, a lot of businesses particularly Asian ones forget this. Often attempting to endorse as many products as they can, Brew Tea Bar keeps it simple which is a golden guideline for me. Basic menu categorized as Slush (Reg: 3.95, Lrg: 4.95), Latte Tea (Reg: 3.75, Lrg: 4.75), Ice Tea (Reg: 2.85, Lrg: 3.85), Milk Tea (Reg: 3.5, Lrg: 4.5, Fresh Brew (Lrg only $4.95), and crepes (4.95). I wouldn't recommend this place to study or get work done due to the limited space and how busy it can get here. 

Service: Very accommodating and willing to make any adjustments to drinks. Talk about taking an initiative to keep the customer happy. 

Drink: I opted to mix the hokkaido and okinawa milk tea which was a great idea (thanks to the yelper who left the tip). Server had told me that it was sweet and adjusted the sweetness for me. 

Overall: I'm looking forward to new locations, keep up the concern for customer satisfaction and Brew Tea Bar will become prevalent on every street corner. Nice work guys!",2015-10-03 20:28:33

Thali-style restaurants fill that falafel type of fast food niche where Indian cuisine is concerned. For $5.99 you get an assortment of dishes with dessert, rice and buttery naan. Though lots of the items are greasy and 'whited out' the variety and presentation is great. Don't expect a spice-attack because you won't get it. The food just isn't that spicy. It's high on salt. 

The mango and plain lassis are made really well here, though sometimes a little too sweet for my liking so adjust your order accordingly, because they're very accommodating to requests.

I orderded a carne asada burrito and one shrimp and one fish taco.  The carne asada part was great.  Thing is they put rice and beans in the burro so I am not getting that mouth full of the wonderful beef that I would like.  It is on the menu that way so can't really complain.

The shrimp taco was good, nothing crazy but I did enjoy.

The fish taco was great!  Great sauce and perfectly cooked fish.  I'll be ordering that again for sure.

The first time I went I also got an asada burro but got a barbacoa taco also.  The barbacoa is very good also and the burro was identical to the first time, which is a good thing.

I have to say that I was a little put off by one of the owners over a Yelp coupon.  He eventually said he would accept the coupon.  

Must say I'll be back though.

Prices are a little higher than the norm (so is the quality) so buy the Yelp gift cert or groupon.

As a vegetarian I do not get Chinese food often and this place had carefully labelled what was, and was not vegetarian. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 spring rolls, chicken low mein, tofu and vegetables in garlic sauce and spicy Szechuan eggplant and tofu. 

It was very hard to get a hold of them. When we called we got a busy number and fax numbers, but then we persevered. The woman said 40-60 minutes. It came more than 70 minutes later. When it arrived the driver did not have change and was yelling as he ran around my building back to his car to see if he had anything. He ended up getting a very small tip because we only had a bit of change.

The bag was dripping in oil. That was our first clue that it may not go well. 

my boyfriend ate his chicken and He said his was ""okay"". I ate mine and it was pretty bad. Very greasy and unflavourful.  I ate a bit and then gave up. We promised we would not order from it again. 

I woke up at 1am horribly sick. I spent the next 4 hours in the washroom. I would never ever eat it again or recommend it to anyone.

 Duff's has been the go-to spot for wings in Toronto forever and is known as the gold standard of wings in this city, do not be confused by the other wing places (st louis, other places), there is a real reason why duff's has a lineup at each of their 2 locations each and every location for easily the last 20 years.",2011-05-16 03:01:14

The food is delicious, selection is endless and the space is great! I would say being between Dixie and Hurontario, is a pretty decent location as you will find a range of Asian restaurants.
I haven't been here a whole lot but whenever I have been or had take out, the food hits and spot and does not disappoint whatsoever- thinking about it right now, makes me want Korean food lol. In terms of selection, they have a good number of combo options for groups and individuals. The individual combo may look a little pricey but it is so worth it and it is actually a lot of food (for me at least). I loooove variety in my meals so I think this is perfect!
The Jajangmyun can be paired with a spicy seafood noodle/rice, fried chicken or pork, and I believe from what I recall tofu soup as well. There is also a soon tofu combo where you get a tofu soup and you choose protein dish to go with it- spicy pork, bulgogi, fish or dumplings. This also comes with a steamed egg and pancake. It's a lot of food but so yummy and fulfilling. There are so many choices if you are just looking for an entree or shareable items so I am sure you will find what you like.

Service is pretty quick and even with the place filling up, the service is still great. They also have sectioned rooms where larger groups can gather and main dining area with the rest of the tables.

The place was clean and bright. The menu displayed a variety of good looking dessert photos, and the staff in the kitchen was assembling a big bowl of shaved ice while I was in line, it got me excited to try out the Taiwanese desserts here.
We ordered Taro Ball No. 5 (hot), Tofu Pudding No. 2 (hot), and Meet Fresh Signature Herbal Jelly (cold). I was surprised that they did not have taro balls as it was just afternoon, looking at other reviews seems like they often do not prepare them.  Substitution was mini taro balls, which threw off the ratio.  
Both Taro Ball No.5 and Tofu Pudding No.2 came not as expected.  The amount of the content looked much less than the photos on the menu. Taro Ball No.5 looked like just liquid soup, the ingredients took up about half of that soup.  The red bean soup was the only thing we could taste, the small orange and purple-colored balls were tasteless (we were expecting sweet potatoes and taro taste).
The table next to us ordered Taro Ball No.4 and that one was piled up nicely as one would expect, made me think our dishes were prepared by a less experienced staff.
Tofu Pudding No.2 was supposed to have barley, but the one that arrived barely had any and we had to send it back and had another one made.  This one tasted better than Taro Ball No.5, but the tofu pudding was not as smooth as the Hong Kong ones that we were used to.
Meet Fresh Signature Herbal Jelly was the winner out of the three dishes.  At least the amount and ratio were closest to the photo on the menu after the mini taro balls substitution.  Taste was refreshing, could have used another evaporated milk pod though (only one was given).  Texture of the herbal jelly, tapioca, and mini taro balls combined together was fun to chew.

I had the crepe with ice cream and my girlfriend had the banana split. 
The crepe looked amazing as i was about to dig in, but once I got a taste of it, I knew that they hadn't made it themselves and were probably buying them in packages. A girl just knows.

On the other hand, the banana split was delicious! The right amount of everything you expect on a traditional banana split!

We sat at the bar.  My husband had on shorts and a button down short sleeve shirt, me jean pedal pushers, a cotton blouse.  We both had on nicer flip flops.  I felt fine as far as my dress was concerned.  Husband felt like we should have been dressier, but I saw other people in there dressed like we were, so I still think you can be nice casual here and fit in fine.

Excellent cocktails.  My husband had the John Daly which tasted like sweet tea.  He downed several within the span of minutes.  I had the cucumber ginger collins.  Quite good!  Has fresh cracked pepper but don't let that turn you off.  It is a really good drink!  Very refreshing.  They also have different beers.  Mostly in bottles but will serve in frosted glass.

My husband and I had a wonderful crock of  the mussels in white wine with side of pomme frites.  There are several variations.  The bartender was fantastic.  She recommended the curry ones, but I'm not a huge fan of curry.    We loved the mussels and right when we were finishing up the mussels, we were presented with slices of fresh french bread to sop up the juices.  Right on queue it seems.  The pomme frites were excellent, too!  Would be nice if they had an herb mayonaisse to serve with them rather than just ketchup.  That would be a great addition.

If you are looking for a real raw bar in town, you cannot go wrong in this place.  They have pretty much any shellfish you want.  I will definitely be returning to try the oysters, crab, shrimp and clams.  The presentation was excellent.  I will also try dinner.  Loved the atmosphere.   I think the restaurant will do well.  They are filling an empty niche.",2010-06-21 15:46:53

Frank Marino starts the show as Joan Rivers and does a highly dated stand up comedy routine. For example, Marino did a joke revolving around him taking a flight on Hooters Air that week. Wikipedia tells me that Hooters Air ceased operations in April 2006, so it's a joke that's 11 years past its shelf life. That was the most egregious example that I could remember, but there were many more dated jokes that made me roll my eyes. There were some funny jokes too, but nothing that made me laugh out loud.

I figured that since many of the impersonations were of singers, that the cast would also sing. Nope, it's all lip syncing. Disappointing. Most of the cast did look like the person they were impersonating and did a good job of mimicking individual mannerisms. The costumes for the whole cast were impressive.

I wouldn't pay to see this show, but I'm glad I got to see it once so I can at least say I've seen it after living in Vegas all these years.",2017-12-10 19:28:08

I got the regular sushi dinner. It was 8 pieces of nigiri and a tuna roll. I asked for salmon to be substituted for the tuna roll and they fulfilled my request without an issue. I was served miso soup and salad. The salad was fine, pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant. The miso soup was good, not too salty which is important. 

My dinner came out and it looked lovely. It was a nice mix of fish. The rice was perfectly constituted and nothing fell apart as I picked it up with chopsticks. The fish was very fresh and delicious, it was cut well. The only thing is they do not put wasabi on it so it's up to you to do that. It's not a big deal considering it's suburbia.

I have been a long time shopper of the south park location but has never really bought much of anything from the store, I think I own more non-clothing items than clothing-items from them. Reason being, I feel like even the sale items are not affordable enough. However, I spotted some great clearance items today and picked up 2 dresses and a skirt. 

My best experience was the fitting room. The lady who was working the fitting room(blonde, wavy long hair, petite, tan) was very courteous. I can easily say it is the top 3 fitting room experiences I've had in my life. She greeted me immediately after I walked into the fitting room area, took the clothes off my hands. Then she hung my clothes up in different sections in the room. Asked for my name, introduced herself and wrote my name outside the door and told me if i needed a different size or something to go with any piece, just let her know. Now, everything up until now may seem pretty standard for an athro experience, however...after being in the room for about 5 min, she checked on me by calling me by my first name, asked if i have any clothes i do not want and wants to take out from the fitting room...that is very nice of her, who doesn't want a less cramped space? lastly, when i was finally done with trying out my clothes, she was still very pleasant, said it was a pleasure and smiled the whole time. Let me just say, I am sure working the fitting room can be QUITE annoying, so she is definitely very good at it, I wish I could tip her!

I went today because I needed to colour my hair. I loved the option for $35 to do just the hair line, if you have greys coming in. Unfortunately, mine were way too long, and I needed to have the full head of colour done. 

A full head of colour is one flat rate (unlike some other places that charge you more if you have more hair etc). This is good for me because I'm in the latter end of the hair volume spectrum. Add an extra $10 for ammonia free colour which is so much better for your scalp. Overall, it cost me $90 including taxes, which I felt was quite reasonable. That included a quick blow dry (no styling)

They sat me down, and got me some tea. Lots of HELLO magazines to pass my time.  I felt bad I wasn't as chit chatty with my colourist as some of the others. I have noticed that sometimes, in new salons, you feel comfortable, sometimes you feel really apprehensive. I was nervous a little, I'm not sure why, perhaps it depends on how comfortable the person working on your makes you feel. 

The girl washing my hair did a great job, gave me some tips on styling and everyday maintenance. She tried to make some small talk, but felt patronized a little when she asked me if I was still in school. I know she didn't mean much by it. 

Anyway, back to the business of it all, overall the colour was great. I love the natural balancing shampoo they use, and a very good job in marketing it. I also got some samples. 

Found out also that men's haircuts are around $25-30 (so reasonable!). And free clean up between appointments, you just need to walk in. My husband remains loyal to his barber, but I hope someone else will check this out!",2013-01-15 18:13:58

I'll keep this brief so please excuse my bluntness.  The people who answer the phones and handle customers at the front desk talk in overly brusque tones to the customers, make customers wait too long before they acknowledge them in person or on phone, and just generally have terrible phone skills on both a people and technical level.  Forget about it if you need a stylist with a certain specialty, because either they don't have a clue or will just match you up with whomever is available regardless of what you asked for.  I got a better result from the student at the beauty school down the street than the ""specialist"" they set me up with.  The salon itself is decorated nicely, but is so dirty with fingerprints on everything and a thick layer of dust that's highly visible in all the out of the way places.

This place is downtown and parking will be a little difficult so plan on that aspect.  I don't care about parking and would never gauge a restaurant on how good the parking is, but just to let you know if you go.  We go to a lot of Mexican food restaurants here in Phoenix and anywhere we travel.  We enjoy great Mexican food.  

When we walked in, at about 7:30PM on a Saturday night, the hostess looked at us like we made her mad.  She got up from her seat, grabbed two menus and said ""this way"".  I tried to make small talk but she would not even acknowledge me.  We sat at a nice table by the window and she was gone.  No personality at all and no enjoyment in what she was doing.
Our waitress was nice and very attentive.  We were in a slight rush but she did not mind and we enjoyed her attitude.  She was the only bright star of the night.  We even asked her if the hostess was having a bad day and to let the manager know that she gives a very bad first impression.  We saw her walk over to what I assume was the manager and tell him something.  He just shook his head and she walked away.

This place talks a good deal about their bold approach to Mexican food and their name implies that this will be memorable.  From a food perspective, it was less than mediocre.  First, their salsa was bland and tasted like something you get from the grocery store.  The chips were stale and flavorless.  There was only one type of salsa and it had zero spicy-ness.  We ordered guacamole and it was OK.  Not the best, but ok.  We ordered street tacos to split, with three different fillings to get a flavor for what they had to offer.  They too were bland.  The plate came with Chorizo as an accompaniment.  It tasted ok but was less than room temperature.  We asked the waitress if it was supposed to be cold and she said ""no"".  She offered us a replacement but there was no need.  The other item on the plate was a crema guacamole paste that was inedible.  

Overall I just do not think this place has good food.  Nothing tasted great, nothing stood out, and most was either bland, made poorly, or was not good.  We have so much to offer in Phoenix when it comes to great Mexican fare.  I would hate for a visitor to get the impression that this is anything close to our potential.",2018-07-31 01:17:50

The consistency was right for a cappuccino, the espresso was bold without being bitter or acidic, and the whole thing was very pleasant. While we were there, tons of people came in to get ice cream. Maybe next time I should try some ice cream...it looked tasty. I did have a sample of one of their vegan chocolate baked goods and it was incredible! I was shocked!

A major reason why I'm so generous with my stars here is that the bathroom mirror makes you always look good. Can I get one in my house, please? I can't emphasis enough how your whole frame of mind changes when you look into a mirror and think, ""damn, my skin looks great!"" whether that's at 3 in the morning or 7 in the evening (let's add on to that: wow, my eyes sparkle and do I detect a shimmer in my hair?) OK, so maybe there's some kind of hocus pocus going on in that mirror because I rarely, if ever give four stars to a hotel.

Rooms are well-appointed, the wood panel floors are nice and the bed, bedding and pillows made for a good night's sleep. It's also spacious enough, with a couch and coffee table area. 

I *loved* the outdoor patio that is off the bar. There's a fire going on out there, along with heating lamps. A real treat for those of us who hail from cities where cold winters are a source of our discontent. The bar itself is comfy and nice, only complaint being that the prices are that of what you'd expect in a New York City bar (8 bucks for a Three Olives cocktail? 8-10 bucks for a glass of average wine?). Oh and that pool! It glows in different colors at night. There was a night when I sat on the patio (which overlooks it) and it was just a really cool effect. I think that the deck is a major draw to staying here. And because it's the desert, no effin' mosquitoes, so you can sit out here all night if you want.

Staff is accommodating and sweet, especially the gals who worked during the day in the bar/restaurant during the week and on Saturday. The bartenders during the week were really cool, too. Not sure why this bar closed at 11pm on a Thursday. Major bummer. I guess it's a slow time of year. I just wish they could be consistent, as the night before the bar closed at midnight (and when I asked the front desk how late the bar was open, I was told midnight). 

I'm a big fan of rain showers and the water pressure was decent (until someone flushed a toilet). The hard water stains by the drain were kind of icky to have to look at...someone needs to go at the grout with a toothbrush. Also curious why they have those cards out that say they are a green hotel, but my towels were changed daily (I hung them up as directed). I can see changing out the washcloths but it's a bit excessive to change out the towels. Also worth noting that no hotel seems to practice what they preach on those cards.

One drawback to the hotel is that the gym is TINY. As in, two treadmills, two elliptical machines (one of which wasn't working) and one bike. The weight room, also tiny, has a good amount of free weights. I was thankful that Hotel Indigo didn't seem to have any other business travelers because working out in the early morning would have been impossible.

I am also not such a fan of the dreary meeting room on the fifth floor, either. What's up with that? I kept looking up at the black ceiling with exposed vents with despair, although I was hardly in a desperate situation. Not to mention, there's a lack of any natural light and ugh, I can't see anyone wanting to spend time in there, even when surrounded by the most entertaining and coolest colleagues (the Yelp CMs, of course).

Bath products are by Aveda (Rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner. Tiny bars of soap, which I'm not a fan of (shower gel, please!) and an unappealingly scented lotion. They are not generous with replenishing the products. This wouldn't be a big deal if this were not a hotel owned by the Intercontinental, but when the Westin and W replenish your products daily, you have to wonder why the Intercontinental is cutting corners in this way. If you're going to call something a ""boutique"" hotel, then bring on the amenities. 

As others mention, if you're sensitive to noise, you might not want to stay in this hotel (or in Scottsdale). The hotel kindly provides bedside ear plugs, however. 

None of the above mentions are a deal breaker though, just worth noting. I'm a fan of this hotel and look forward to staying here again in the future. 

Then again, this could be just the mirror talking...",2011-01-30 21:29:13

I have to agree with Thomas about this whole cityscape fiasco, it was a little hard to find, but we got there all the same and were happy when we did. They really did a nice job with the place. I love the set up, the open bar and kitchen, and all the decor was nice. 
We sat up at the Chefs table, and all the guys behind the counter were super friendly, which is above and beyond if you ask me, just getting orders out and executing them well is enough, so it was nice that they were interacting with guests on top of it. Our server was friendly as well, very helpful. The bar did start to run a little slow, our second round of drinks took awhile, but no biggie. I did, however, find the food just a little underwhelming. One of the cooks gave us a sample of the pretzel fondue, and to be honest it is what sticks out to me the most, they were delicious. We also had the black mussels with spicy pork shoulder and pommes fites, the broth was a little bland, which was shocking because they had a really intense aroma. The sea salt chips were alright and the potato fitters were forgettable. For an entree we split the grilled sword fish, which was good. My Husband was a little disappointed that with a name like The Arrogant Butcher they didn't have more cuts of meat on the menu. I think our favorite part of the meal was the after school specials we ordered, they were a great summer drink, very refreshing, otherwise we may go back, but its not on the top of our list.",2011-05-17 16:38:18

Tip #2: Fish quality isn't great, so don't come here for the sushi.

This was a tough review, because Sake Rok does have two big positives:
1) Servers were attentive and really friendly;
2) Alcohol! Liquor selection is excellent, cocktail list is extensive with fun/quality options, and top shelf sake is available (although, as I mention above, off the menu).

The problem is that the food quality wasn't impressive. The fish quality was not good so I would avoid any sushi items here, and the non-sushi dishes were hit or miss. I really liked the tomahawk steak, the mushroom tobanyaki, the seared scallops, and the wagyu sliders. But OTOH I didn't like either the tuna or beef tataki, the shishito peppers were super oversalted, and the ""rok"" shrimp tempura and the shrimp/vegetable tempura weren't breaded that well (and both very small portion size). Also, I've been here twice but they were out of the honey toast dessert on both occasions. Bummer.

But I could see this spot possibly working out if you're mainly coming to have drinks and enjoy the atmosphere (music plays loudly here, and waitstaff will periodically perform in choreographed dance shows), and plan to have food as a side / secondary priority (or you have to stick with very specific items that you know are good). If food is at all the #1 priority, I think you'll be disappointed. And again, I'd avoid the sushi no matter what.

Given all the above, I think 1.5-2* for food, +1* for service and strong alcohol selection is fair.",2016-08-11 01:20:16

OK, OK, I'll admit that when I first entered the place, I was concerned by the decor as well. A glance at the enormous menu offering what appeared to be a mundane slew of tired old ""American Food"" items left me a bit melancholy as well. I think that I am a bit less critical because these two first impressions set the bar a little low for me.

BUT... the draft beer was nice and cold, the staff working up on the deck that night were very attentive and friendly, and the gyro I ordered was... AWESOME! (One of the wait staff recommended it, saying it was probably the best thing on the menu.) Forget $50 porterhouse steaks here - why the hell would you do that? Go to Morton's, Capital Grille, or Ruth's Chris if you want to spend a fistful of money on some muscle to gnaw on.

I would disagree with the 5 star (?!?!) and 1 star reviews here. This place isn't The French Laundry on Mount Washington OR Pittsburgh Food Hell Meets Third World Inflation...

The Good Points;

The Oysters Rockefeller were pretty good, I liked the bed of sea-salt and herbs they were laid on..

The Caesar Salads looked pretty good that my brother and his girlfriend ordered, and they didn't complain about them being bad.

My Prime Rib Cut seemed to be a lot more then 12 ounces. 

The Bad Points.

Prime Rib seemed tough, even when cooked at rare-medium rare temperatures.

If you love water, you'll love their French Onion Soup! absolutely no flavor at all. None.

The waiter, Fabio, needs a severe attitude adjustment, his words may sound nice but once those stop his facial expressions and anger come out.. he snubbed us after we needed to pay separate checks after we were sat down. And when observing him deal with other people his eyes rolled once they completed their requests. when it was time to pay he rudely asked if I was ready to pay. I find it very very sad that he makes great money at a great place and hates it there. maybe this will serve as a wake-up call to him and he'll straighten himself out. 

One star off for the soup, and one star off for Fabio's attitude.

We were seated right away and given this amazing corn salsa to start. I wasn't a fan of the chips, they were a little stale for my taste, but the corn salsa was crisp and refreshing. Definitely a step up from the tomato salsa you get at chain restaurants. I took V's recommendation and ordered the epic tuna burrito rare with a side of avocado pasta salad. I was tempted to order the beer battered salmon tacos but I'll save that for another Thursday. The bf got a beer battered shrimp taco and a chicken taco. I didn't mind the wait, we had corn salsa to keep us company. 

Food came out, those tacos looked huge! I seriously have not seen tacos that stuffed, I definitely will be returning for those tacos now. The shrimp was tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside, as it should be. The epic tuna burrito is rightfully named with generous chunks of fresh tuna. I love sushi so I enjoyed the rare tuna.

Because Mucho Burrito will either give you zero bell peppers or one entire raw pepper in your burrito.

Otherwise, the food is decent if you like Mexican, and I love it.  The drinks are overpriced, and the deserts take 10 minutes, but really the main issue is that they absolutely never slice the peppers small enough.",2015-09-19 02:39:46

We ordered a Reeses pieces cheesecake and a 3 scoop ice cream. The cheesecake wasn't bad, actually. The cake slices are definitely a bit on the pricier side, but the portions are quite large and you're probably paying that around that much for your generic Jack Astor's dessert anyway.

There was only 1 other group in there with us when we dropped by around dinner time on a Friday, but the waiter (who looked like the manager) was very attentive. He was pretty nice and quick with getting us our items and the bill. 

The vibe of the place is very.. unique - it's dark and dank like a bar, with a bunch of couches towards the front, yet they serve desserts and a variety of savoury food. I guess if you're looking for a dessert shop vibe, you probably shouldn't come here. If you want drinks and desserts at the same place, this might be a decent option. We never tried any of the drinks, though.

Sadly, it seems that the vibe and type of people who go that make Yelpers dislike this establishment. I think I'd only return if they choose to renovate the place as it does feel a bit strange being labelled as a dessert/cafe place.",2015-07-12 20:13:23

Such was my experience when coming across this delightful eatery in none other than the Phoenix Airport Dining area, next to Sauce, another solid eatery. 

I was catching a morning flight to California for the holidays and realized that Chelsea's kitchen had been put in since my last visit. I was charmed by the lights above the bar made from antique spritzer bottles and felt a little like I had stepped into an establishment in that greatest of American cities, New York. 

As it was a bit early for me for lunch I ordered the oatmeal, which as far as oatmeal goes was excellent but I also ordered a cup of coffee and most glorious of surprises, they bring you a mug and a good sized french press, which you let sit for a few minutes and of course....you guessed it, press. The coffee was amazing. I asked the bartender what he thought and he agreed that it was exceptional. Best of all, between the oatmeal and the coffee the whole bill was only $8.20 and with tip, $10.50, that is a heck of good deal at the airport, not only on price, but on the exceptional quality. After reading the other reviews I'll be going back to the airport for something other than a flight and you guessed it, to eat at Chelsea's kitchen. 

Note, I loved the place but I want to try a meal or two before I consider the coveted five star rank but from my initial experience, a solid 4 with 5 start possibilities.:-)",2013-01-01 21:50:07

I just never found the time to go as well as the Arts District isn't somewhere i normally hang out. Couple that with the lack of good eateries in the area pretty much sums it up: There's a hyped up bar in the middle of hipster-ville without that many restaurants within drunk walking distance.

Given the opportunity to finally go to VR i've realized how much time i've wasted not going here. The cocktails are original, creative, and down right delicious. 

Specific drinks i cant remember the names of and i'm sure they'll rotate the menu every few months to keep things fresh.

One noticeable thing are they way they make their Old Fashions. I merely took a sip another's cocktail but they mix it differently. Not sure what kind of bourbon was used by the bitters and citrus are the same that i use, know, and love. The flavor was off in a way that makes me want to discover how they did it so i can have it all the time. 

So in conclusion:
- Not my crowd or type of atmosphere but i can look past it all with the right company. 
- Try to come early as the later it get the more crowded it gets and conversation will be a tad difficult with the noise level ever increasing.
- Parking...LoL Good luck

My friend W had the Skirt Steak Chile Relleno, which was a nice-sized entree for $16.  I had a bite, and the steak was tender and the pasilla sauce was flavorful.  I went with the Grilled Corn app to start - amazing char, creamy mayo-butter and cotija cheese, then a zippy punch of hot pepper flakes (get this damn app!!!) - and the Tortilla Soup.  My meal came to $14, and I was very, very pleased.

So, while we're sitting there in comes a couple women with Vegas showgirl headdresses and gowns, some fat cat businessmen, and 10 hot chicks in short, black dresses.

This place is COZY - there's probably 8-10 grilling tables that seat 4-5 people each. I personally wouldn't recommend going in a group any bigger than 4 people. The interior is dimly lit, and while I haven't been to Korea, this seems to be the real deal. Be prepared for quite a wait if you arrive after 6pm. Parking is a pain, but there's actually a couple more spots in the back!

SERVICE
Quick, efficient, and best of all, they know what you need better than you do! Dropped chopsticks are replaced before you can raise a hand. Lettuce running low? The waitress has got you covered before you reach your last leaf. Did I mention lettuce is unlimited? YAAAS.

FOOD
Meats do not come marinated, but that's what the dipping sauces are for! Thick cuts of juicy beef and pork. I personally recommend the pork jowl, pork belly, and beef ribs. A complimentary serving of steamed egg and soup is also included. They're not known for side dishes but will give you 3 types (most of which are spicier than usual!) 

QUALITY/VALUE
For 4 people, I'd recommend their combo ($58) plus an extra order of meat (~$22) and a bowl of rice each. We paid around $27 dollars per person - around the same/cheaper than AYCE and definitely better quality.

The menu is a bit confusing on the website. I was not familiar with many of the items, and I have been eating Indian food my whole life. But at least I ventured outside my comfort zone and tried something new!

We started out with the samosas which were excellent. We also had aloo curry and paneer curry with bhaturas. What are bhaturas you ask? Well, it is similar to Indian fry bread. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. Completely decadent and delicious to dip in the curries! Both curries were delicious as well.

There are also novelty items.  Do you need a bacon wallet?  How about a punching nun?  The novelty items cover a wall on one side of the store, the candy, the other.  In the middle are both, mixed together.

Fellow at counter was nice enough but said the groupon didn't explain correctly and he had to charge me extra. They also charge sales tax on full price not groupon price but didn't feel like arguing the point. Didn't end up charging me up charge because he didn't put in my salad.

I've made the mistake of trying to go here on a Friday or Saturday night, and have had to wait over an hour....multiple times!  If you wanna go to Cabo, go on a Wednesday or Thursday night.  You usually can get right in and get seated without any wait at all.  My gf and I choose to sit outside on the patio as it was a gorgeous late summer's evening.  The evening seemed to have a certain tune or melody; with the reggae lowly playing and acting as a theme song for the evening. 

When we first sat down, I was worried that despite the fact that we were seated immediately, we were gonna have to wait awhile, because the patio-area was full of peeps with the same idea we had.  But to my surprise, our waitress was totally in control and we felt like we were the only table out there. 

We went on half-price pint night, and I was able to make two DOS Equis Ambers disappear before our meal ever arrived.  As part of our Cabo tradition, we ordered the famous Baja SHRIMP and CRAB DIP!!  I have always maintained that the pita bread makes this dish and not the actual dip itself.  And this time, our pita slices were perfect, not too hard or burnt (as I've had them before), so of course our Crab dip was extra-awesome!  

For dinner, I ordered the Carne Asada Wrap (see pic) and my gf ordered the shrimp and chicken Baja Bowl (see pic).  Everything arrived to our liking and after taking a few pics for you fellow YELPERs, we jumped right in.  I loved the carne asada wrap.  The wrap was very warm and stuffed with all of the traditional tex-mex fillings - refried beans, cheese, onions and peppers, etc.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  There is nothing worse than taking a bite of a wrap or burrito and you find that the meat is tough and chewy - not the case with my wrap.  I could not have asked for anything more out of a $9.25 wrap.  My gf loved her Baja bowl.  She was especially fond of her decision to get a mix of shrimp and chicken.  Her one complaint was that the chicken seemed to be a bit bland, and lacked that mystical ""something"".  Otherwise she was more than satisfied with her meal.

My only complaint with this place would be the guacamole.  As a guac lover, I expect that if you offer it on your menu as an appetizer, you can make it and make it in an appeasing manner.  Their guac was anything but impressive. They prolly need to go back to the drawing board with their guac recipe.  If you are going there looking to get an appetizer, stick with the Crap dip and stay away from the guac.  And yes, I like saying and writing ""GUAC""!  

Other than the guac, our meal, and our overall dining experience was great.  Our server, though busy at first, was on top of everything, and I can't say one bad thing about her service that evening.  Everything just seemed to work well together - the late summer evening and the cold Dos Equis, the hot crab dip with soft pita slices, the waitress, the wrap and the bowl, they all came together in an ooze of perfect harmony, to create the perfect dining melody.",2011-09-04 20:29:58

The place is really cute so a meal out on the patio feels a little like a short trip over the border. The menu doesn't have a lot of options for vegetarians (me) but I still really enjoyed my meal & would come back, that's how much I like this place. My boyfriend & I had:

- Queso Fundido with Rajas: Delicious - good real cheese mixed with a lot of peppers & onions. I liked that there was some salsa (or a lot of cooking liquid from the peppers) mixed in with the cheese so it was a lighter fundido than just full on cheese.
- Guacamole: Love their guac. It's really chunky & really fresh.
- Huitlacoche Crepas: Such an interesting dish & totally unlike what I've had at other Mexican restaurants. The flavor of Huitlacoche is hard to describe - it's savory, a little like mushrooms, has a creamy texture. The flavor combination of the dish was very sweet & savory - savory huitlacoche with sweet pomegranate sauce and seeds with tart blue cheese, all wrapped in a soft crepe. 
- Carnitas: My boyfriend ordered this and said the meat was really good. The serving size is enough for 2 meals. The corn tortillas that came with it were really good and fresh. The mexican rice and refried beans that came with it were probably not vegetarian and were just average.

Anyway I did come here yesterday for lunch.  Although the service as usual was impeccable, they didn't have the specials available so I ordered what I would think to be the dish I like which was the Napolitan.  Unfortunately it wasn't too good at lunch.  I was expecting it to be a lot better.

Fast forward back to tonight.  Now they had 3 pasta dishes, one of them I already tried and liked.  The other one had chilli so that was an automatic no.  So I got the Spaghetti al Funghi with cream sauce and trio mushroom.

Anyway, I started with an Ice Coffee (pretty good here) and their excellent house salad (they have one of the better house salads for me).

Then the entree... first bite... WTF... it's so spicy.  I looked up to check the menu.  Didn't see any indication of anything spicy, but apparently there was a bit of chili in the dish. (Too much for my level).

Anyway, they were gracious enough to change the dish for me.  I then asked for the Napolitan instead.

Oooh soo yummy.  It's not too sour, it had the right level of tanginess.  The sausages give is a little kick (I don't think there were sausages at lunch).  It's not in the ""I'm in love"" level as Crepes a-go-go's Tom Tom but it is a very close second to Casa Manila.  I think the Napolitan is now designated as another comfort food for myself.  Still pricey for me, but it is good.  So maybe do not come here hungry next time (fill up on McD as the saying goes).

Anyway still a bit peckish after the meal.  Gave it a couple of minutes to subside.

After realizing I am eating here too much to the point I am having trouble deciding what I haven't tried here yet.  I caved and got the Crepe with lemon sauce and vanilla custard with vanilla ice cream.  Not sure if I liked that one or not.

I guess I did like it.  It's not too sour, though I wanted something tart, but not too tart that it will make things dark (because my eyes are closed).  The lemon sauce is light and the ice cream buffers the flavors well.  I think the Fuji apple one is still better now that I think about it.

We were a party of 26 (well, maybe 25 because I don't think the 6 month old baby had anything) and had 3 tables, which consisted of 7 families and our parents.  Most of us were Chinese or knew good Chinese food.

The service was pretty much the best I'd ever seen at this place and we've been here a lot of times.

I have driven by so many times and just assumed that it was a standard bakery/ cafe type deal. I was wrooonggg!!

I recently stumbled upon it here, on Yelp, and was immediately intrigued. 

These folks know what they are doing! I came specifically to try the Honduran menu, because although I grew up in the southwest, I had never had Honduran food. Everything sounded so amazing that I had to try it for myself.

Get ready, this was a culinary adventure worth going on again and again!
What I tried:
Baleada- These are like the best breakfast quesadillas you will ever have. The chamol is like pico de gallo but with cucumber. Game changer!
Pupusa- I was to eat these all day forever. It's a little pocket filled with joy and cheese. I got the loroco (similar to a caper) and cheese and fell in love!
Plato Tipico- You know, just your typical plate. Wrong! It's a plate of amazing things! It has fried plantains, tender AF chicken, rice cooked in coconut milk and a big dollop of crema. So good!
Honduran Tamales- My mom makes the best tamales,bBut these might have been just as good and may be even better (sorry mum!). The masa is the perfect texture and so flavorful and then is filled to capacity with chicken and beans and olives and all the good things. Very delicious.

It really adds to the dining experience, along with the inside lighting & decor. I would consider it more of a laid back upscale place, if that makes any sense at all.

It may have been the boiling rage I had just experienced in finding out Kan Pai no longer offers AYCE that sent me into a sushi rage. Luckily, Sushi Mon is no more than a quarter mile down the street so we decided to give it a shot.

At $26.95 this place was HOPPING. One of my main issues with this place is that it is very small and when it is busy it can become extremely cramped looking at their gigantic menus. Couple that with busy sushi chefs who only occasionally look your way and waitresses that have to be stared down for even a glass of water and I was already a bit perturbed even before trying anything.

The rolls were subpar and their special mango mesquite roll just had some funky flavors going on and I couldn't figure out if it was tasty or disgusting which is a first for me. Their nigiri menu was plentiful and tasty, and the best roll is definitely the chubby roll. I would HIGHLY advise anyone against ordering the 9-1-1 roll as it is legit painful to eat. Normally when I order the roll elsewhere it is a bit spicy but nothing compares to having to eat about half the ginger in front of you and having to guzzle 3 glasses of water and STILL having the burning sensation on your tongue. I am going to have nightmares about that roll and each of us could only muster one piece. Eater beware!",2011-01-22 00:09:03

The hamburger I ordered was very good, but I was severely disappointed in how small it was.  Way overpriced for the size of the burger.  The fries I had on the side were very good; however the place does not have RANCH.  So for my kid this was a killer issue since he pretty much has to have ranch for his chicken fingers, but in general who the heck doesn't have regular ranch?  Ok, they have some form of RANCH, I think it was like a cucumber ranch or something like that, I tried it and it was NOT good.  I don't want to be caught up on one simple thing, but really I just cannot believe a place like this does not serve regular ranch, that just blows my mind.

I settled on Glass Nickel because their pizza is good and I'd get some nice pasta out of it (the salads sounded good, too, but I wanted some warm food). I was able to do my order online, which I LOVE (two reasons: I am antisocial, and there should be less chance of getting it wrong since I wasn't relying on somebody to listen closely and write down what I said). I was able to put the tip on my credit card, another good thing. 

One thing I wasn't aware of was the email updates. I got an email once the order was finalized and sent, then another one when it was being prepared and then a third when it was out for delivery. It was a cold Saturday night, but delivery was pretty darn fast. The delivery driver was your stereotypical friendly stoner, and he had his own pen! (I used to order delivery more often, and I was always surprised at how often the driver didn't have anything to write with).

Onto the food! 

Hot and sour soup: I'm pretty picky about hot and sour soup and this one was done perfectly. It has more of that ""sour"" taste from the vinegar which is what I enjoy. The spice level was perfect as well. 

""Beef"" pan fried noodles: Taste wise, this was good. However, I did wish it had more sauce to it because it was pretty dry. 

Fried tofu and ""fish"": I don't know why but I really liked the texture of the ""fish""...most likely from what it's made of. I'm not completely sure what's it made from but I'm thinking it's tofu related. If you close your eyes while eating this, the texture is very similar to fish. 

Roti canai: my favorite! Roti canai is what I always get when I visit Malaysia. This is the closest place I can find that is similar to the ones back home. It's a thin flakey pastry (almost like a pancake) that you dip into chicken curry...in this case ""chicken"" curry. I highly recommend this dish.

3 different sushi rolls (spicy tuna, jack fruit, crunchy roll): Instead of the usual cucumber rolls or California rolls, Chef Kenny came up with more interesting rolls. Out of the 3 that we got, I liked the jack fruit because it's different. It had a nice sweet taste to it that I surprisingly enjoyed.

The meat and banchans are pretty good, not crappy at all. They do lack desserts but so does Sura. I guess desserts aren't highlighted in Korean BBQ because people are too stuffed with meat and ran out of room for anything sweet afterwards. Everything they serve on the buffet may not be an A+... maybe a B- 

They have at least 4 different marinated meat selections and another 3 or 4 ""dry"" meat which includes beef, pork and chicken. They also serve seafood such as shrimp and squid. They have all sorts of ""salads"" or cold dishes, along side other appetizers? Such as pot stickers and grilled fish. They also serve sushi rolls but I never give those any attention.

We went to Poros for Valentine's day because I had a birthday coupon. The space is very open and blue lighting gives it a nautical feel. We were seated right away and our server Steve was very friendly and helpful. We each order a specialty drink Athena's Dirty Pillows and the Kapanos. Both very very good. 

We started off with the grilled octopus mezze and it was tender and fresh. Very good.

They sell fish by the pound for whole fish and the ounce for fillets. They have 4 different preparations; chargrilled with a lemon sauce which I had on a whole Branzino, Tandoor roasted with Indian spices and yogurt sauce which my partner had on the black bass, and the a la Plancha pan fried with lemon sauce we had on the scallops. They were all very good but the Tandoor roasted was the star. The seasoning penetration was much deeper than the other preparations. 

We had the charred broccoli as a side. It. Was. Amazing. I would never usually mention broccoli but this was transendant. Charred broccoli, glazed walnuts, pickled onions and bacon. Wow. It shocked me with how good it was.

We had the poached pear with panna Cotta and the baklava ice cream. The pear was just ok but I would suggest the baklava ice cream.

The only thing that I have a question about is that the entrees came with couscous and sauces but it was not packed in my doggy bag. When I pay 26 for a plate I want to take all my leftovers and it offended me that they probably just trashed it.",2018-02-15 18:03:25

This year the price was about $70. for one day or about $100. for two days. 

I thought it would be another year of pork belly after pork belly but this year it started to look like it might be a year of Burrata Cheese since I saw it at three eateries the first day but it wasn't. Pork over the course of two days was the big protein I think followed by beef and then shrimp. I only remember seeing just one chicken dish in the two days. They offered endless desserts but it seemed like less desserts than in past years. Great beers , Great Local wineries and Great non-local Wineries showed up. Bottled Water was provided, hand washing stations , hand sanitizer and clean restrooms. 

Saturday

Of course I wasn't able to try as much as I wanted too due to stomach room and did miss out on many great things but I still managed to make a nice dent on the offerings.

The Avalon Gourmet put out a beautiful assortment of fine cheeses, crackers, pickles including a really tasty bread and butter kind of pickle that was sort of spicy but the crowning offering was the Iberico Ham that is made from some kind of rare black footed pig that only eats acorns and is sort of kissed by the lips of God. Well anyway this ham at Christmas time runs $75. for 4 oz. and the normal catalog price is $52. for just 4 oz. or you can buy it by the leg but that will cost you an arm and a leg. (Gourmetfoodstore.com) It was mighty generous for Avalon Gourmet to bring Iberico Ham to the party.

St Francis put out another jaw dropping pretty salad. I wonder if that salad is ever on their menu?

One of my favorite bites came from Milagro Grill. I don't know what it was called but it was a very tender nicely flavored piece of beef topped with vegetables siting on something horseradish on very thin corn something. The bite as a whole was very delicious. 

I liked the Bite from Sushi Roku. It was something like sushi. It was spicy tuna over a tasty fried seasoned rice patty.

I appreciated the lighter foods that Tertio Wine Bar put out. I tried that Thai Style Cauliflower soup and the tasty light nicely seasoned eggplant. I thought it was nice to have lighter food in this kind of setting.

My husband was able to eat more food than me and really enjoyed the food from Cartwright's , it was Buffalo Sausage with Spatzle and said we need to go there for dinner. He also enjoyed the Porchetta Sandwich from Davanti and decided after a little time passed he wanted another one but sadly Davanti was out of sandwiches by 1:00.

We were at some places at the wrong time when they were having some kind of cooking problem. We hit T. Cook's when the lamb shanks were raw inside. We hit La Grande Orange when the pizzas came out black on the bottom. But we did notice after wards things looked like they were coming out right.

There was so much more and it was an overall great day!

Sunday

It was even harder for me to take pictures on Sunday because it was standing room only between the very big spreads from District American Kitchen , Kai , and the places in-between Gallo Blanco and Hanna. I thought much of the food from Kai was sweet and custardy . For me in that group the plate I took from Hanna I liked the best because I liked the very tasty just one bite of beef and the interesting light Sushi Slider with a lemon slice. My husband really liked the goat taco from Gallo Blanco he also thought the Raw Lamb Heart from Petite Maison was really layered with great flavors. I admit I wasn't brave enough to try goat or raw lamb heart.

The Tuna Crudo really knocked me out from Crudo and just next door was Blue Hound offering Wild Steal head that was light and tasty and I'm sorry I didn't ask what that vegetable was on it that looked like yellow grass but sort of tasted like corn.

Barrio Cafe also put out a very nice mini buffet.  Everything was great but I thought the shrimp with the tastiest slaw was the knock out dish. The Guacamole from Barrio is the only guacamole I've ever seen my husband eat. Sadly Barrio also closed up early I think 1:30.

Relish Burger Bistro put out pork tacos and bacon deviled eggs instead of burgers.

My husband liked the hot dog from Short leash that squirted out cheese and jalapeños but I noticed they had at least three different kinds out there.

Switch made an interesting Beignet with crab siting on slaw.

They were pouring many better wines I noticed that some were $100. bottles. I remember liking a Syrah I thought that came from Oregon and the Patz a Hall Pinot Noir and the Merry Edwards Pinot Noir.

We received many discount cards for many of the restaurants that participated in Devoured.

There is just so much I left out, can't wait to do it again.

I typically ride my bike by that location at least once a week, so this time I decided to stop by for lunch.  The atmosphere was different than I had expected.

The dining area was nice - clean, nice furniture, etc.  However, it did not feel like a barbeque place.  The crowd was mainly older (60+) on a Saturday afternoon.  I did not fit in with my bike apparel, Nook and cell phone.  
The service was good, not great.  I do not want to be too harsh in saying that the older customers got most of the attention.  I hardly got noticed.  Not that I require constant nurturing, but just fill my ice tea!

The food was very good.   I got a beef brisket sandwich with mashed potatoes and a side of gravy.  Also, I could not resist the $1.00 plate of onion rings.  I was satisfied.  It was done just right and not loaded with salt that keeps you thirsty for hours on end.  I thought the meal was pricey for what I received - no not the onion rings, but a $10.00 sandwich!

Recently, we were at Fashion Show Mall and decided to eat at this location. The food here is always good and my wife usually gets the Mediterranean Salad, but has it tailored to how she likes it. I call it 'Stacy Style Salad' -  with no onions or olives, but with extra feta and dressing - she also requests for (2) orders of cut salami to it. Sounds a bit much, but they are always accommodating to make this, and it is pretty delicious. My son and I usually share the salad with her or get a pizza of any variety. Always good.

Why I gave this location a 5 star was because of the service that was provided to us by Javier. He is the bartender/waiter. One of the realest, sweetest human beings you'll meet. Not pretentious, his fantastic personality and always looking out for you. His likeability gave us such ease in dealing with the Christmas shopping crowd that we were dealing with outside of the restaurant. The three of us enjoyed his style and ""I got you"" demeanor so much.  We hope that he has a great Christmas cause he has made us enjoy ours.

We look forward to coming back and requesting for Javier as  our preferred server. If he isn't there and moved on, we would be totally understanding of it cause our assumption would be that he has moved on to do better things which is what we feel he deserves.

Ever since discovering the spicy, tofu delight of this Korean stew, I've lost interest in pho. Maybe it's the banchan. Sorry pho, but if you want to compete, you're gonna have to bring something else to the table (literally). 

So, when we pulled into the shopping center on Eastern and had a choice of Lemongrass Café or Jun's, there was no competition even though Lemongrass is the clear Yelp star winner. I am really surprised Jun's has only three stars. Perhaps I was just starving that day or perhaps I was overjoyed to find kimchi and sundubu in an unexpected spot, but I really enjoyed my meal. 

My hub and I both had vegetarian sundubu. Mine came out a bit more flavorful and spicier, so perhaps there is some inconsistency in their dishes. Even so, I ate my entire bowl and thought it definitely held its own. The banchan were uniformly delicious. The kimchi was addictively spicy; the seaweed had a wonderful sweetness, and the bean sprouts had a white pepper kick. They even had cucumber kimchi, which I adore. We got refills on every single one, and that rarely happens. You can get the sides to go, and I regret not purchasing some for my fridge. 

The shop is a simple, quick-service establishment, and the service is efficient, but not necessarily enthusiastic. They neither earn or lose stars in either of these categories.

Given that Jun's is not in my neighborhood, I probably wouldn't drive back just for a visit, but if I happen to be in the area, I will definitely be excited to feed my belly with some yummy Korean staples. Next time, I will definitely snag some banchan to carry home.",2010-04-12 23:05:31

Let's start off with the fact that I can never tell when it's open. The amount of light that this place gets is equal the amount that batman gets in his cave. I get the bar atmosphere they're trying to go for, but also try and understand the concept of natural light. 
Besides the atmosphere being very college-y and bar-esque I love the pizza here!  It satisfies the gluttonous alter-ego that I have. The slice has to be served on two plates because, that's right, one plate is just not enough. Folks, this epic slice of pizza is bigger than the size of any human being's face including Nicolas Cage's. They have an assortment of pizza toppings to choose from as well.  Everything ranging from the classic cheese to mediterranean toppings and one of my favorites, hawaiian toppings.  I know that they make the pizzas beforehand and just warm up the slices to serve but I don't care. If it tastes good, I like it.",2013-07-25 18:28:38

So, why three? Well, the prices are (very) high, and I'm just not seeing the quality match the cost. Not bad at all, mind you--they have decent products. Just at prices roughly 1.5 times what they should be at.

Located in a plaza just east of 271 on Chagrin Rd, Bowl of Pho is, as far as I know, the first and only Vietnamese restaurant in the area, and it certainly makes a footprint. The decor is easily the best that any Viet spot in Cleveland has to offer. Intimate lighting, clean, classy booths and tables, mirrored walls. Definitely not what we're used in Cleveland, which actually made me worry a little bit about the authenticity of the food (not to mention how diverse the staff was). No worries though, because the food, for the most part, was authentic and on point.

What we ordered:

- Melon / Mango Bubble Tea - both your standard fare powdered smoothie. Good, not great.
- Banh Mi - Delicious, and LOADED with meat. Easily a standout on the menu.
- Banh Xeo (Vietnamese crepe) - Authentic and good, though I'm not a huge fan of the dish itself.  But it was full of bean sprouts, lots of meat, shrimp was tender and juicy, and the crepe was crepe-y. It reminded me of the Filipino ""fresh lumpia"".
- Bun Tom Thit Nuong Cha Gio - Typically my favorite Viet dish to order, they actually failed to deliver. Although they really hooked me up with meat portions, and the shrimp was delicious, they (1) forgot the egg roll and (2) the flavor was way off. They made up for the first offense by preparing it after bringing it to their attention, but it was a little undercooked. As for the flavor, I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the dish overall wasn't flavored correctly. My dinner partner agreed that it was good, but not accurate to the traditional vermicelli noodle dish.
- Pho Dac Biet - I had my reservations after reading some reviews, but came away pleasantly surprised. The soup was bursting with flavor with only a little bit too much cinnamon, and they were not stingy with the ingredients either. Lots of noodles, brisket, beef balls, and bean sprouts. Only a moderate amount of tripe though. Some of the brisket was served slightly undercooked, which as I understand is how it is supposed to be done, which allows it to cook in front of you to your liking.
- Che Ba Mau - A wonderful dessert that strongly resembles the Filipino ""halo-halo"". The filling to ice ratio was about a 5:1, which is probably the opposite for halo-halo, but it was still delicious. I would have liked a little less of the beans and more of the green jelly.

Despite the little hiccup with the cha gio, service was extremely friendly, fast, and attentive.  I found the prices to be very reasonable, and the portions were probably above average. I would definitely go again, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, hearty bowl of pho.",2012-01-17 14:35:27

Here oysters that are regularly $4-5 each at the restaurant (such as top drawer, komumoto, kushi or golden bay to name a few) you'll find at Diana's for around the dollar to dollar fifty range (buy a box for even better value).

The service, while not extremely outstanding is good and the staff is knowledgeable. What I also love about Diana's is that they tell you what date the product was received.

One of the folks at our martial arts school is from the same place Bruno's comes from and she thankfully made us aware.  Prior to Bruno's opening she brought some pizza in that they made while working out the finer points of the dough recipe for the climate here in Vegas.  It smelled great, they offered a couple of slices, and I found a new favorite.  It was just cheese pizza, and it was probably the best cheese pizza I can remember eating.  Ever.

Excited that they finally had their soft opening on October 1st, we went in to try more of what they do, and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered the cheese pizza for my son and the meat lover's pizza for the two of us.  A side of garlic breadsticks and soft drinks complemented the pies and in no time we had our happy pizza faces on.

The toppings were delicious and the crust was amazing even thought they'll tell you they're not quite content with it just yet.  Even more amazing:  no grease sitting on the pie or under the crust.  The meat pizza was delicious, the toppings were tender, and somehow they've found a way to get rid of all the grease and oil that seems to settle on pizzas like this.

They're still getting their rhythm down, but Bruno's is a must visit place if you're on the southwest side of the valley.  Go enjoy a pizza, and help them hit their stride as they approach their grand opening and a full menu.

We tried a wide array of dishes, mostly due to the fact that we had no idea what we were doing. We had the borscht, an assortment of different kebobs, the lamb shank, the (enormous) lamb and beef/pork dumplings, the hachaburi (pretty much a gigantic cheese pizza with a sunny-side-up egg in the middle of it), and the ground beef crepe. Without droning on and on about all the minute details of each dish, I'll just go ahead and say that it was all pretty damn good.

For me, the clear highlight of my meal was the kebobs. The dish came with an assortment of chicken, lamb, and beef kebobs, all of which were hot, tender, and juicy. If I had to pick my favourite out of the three, I would have to go with the lamb.

I also have to mention the ground beef crepe, which was perfectly crispy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. It's absolutely not to be missed.

Final thing I want to mention was the warmth of the wait staff at Suliko. Being a party of entirely Asian diners, our waiter correctly guessed that we had little experience with this kind of cuisine and made excellent recommendations for us.

My first visit to Olive Garden was during midafternoon, so I could be sure to get in. After a late breakfast, I figured a late lunch would be fashionable.

The place is impressive. It's fashioned in Tuscan farmhouse style with a welcoming entryway. There is seating for those who are waiting.

My booth was near the kitchen, and I watched the waiters in white shirts, ties, black trousers and aprons adorned with gold-colored towels. They were busy at midday, punching in orders and carrying out bread and pasta.

It had been a few years since I ate at the older Olive Garden in Mesa, so I studied the two manageable menus offering appetizers, soups and salads, grilled sandwiches, pizza, classic dishes, chicken and seafood and filled pastas.

At length, I asked my server what she would recommend. She suggested chicken Alfredo, and I went with that. Instead of the raspberry lemonade she suggested, I drank water.

She first brought me the familiar Olive Garden salad bowl with crisp greens, peppers, onion rings and yes -- several black olives. Along with it came a plate with two long, warm breadsticks.

The chicken Alfredo ($10.95) was warm and comforting on a cold day. The portion was generous. My server was ready with Parmesan cheese.

As I ate, I noticed the vases and planters with permanent flower displays on the ledges. There are several dining areas with arched doorways. And there is a fireplace that adds warmth to the decor.

Olive Garden has an attractive bar area to the right of the entryway. The restaurant has a full liquor license and a wine list offering a wide selection to complement Italian meals. Nonalcoholic beverages include coolers, specialty coffees and hot teas.

On a hot summer day, I will try the raspberry lemonade that was recommended.

There's a homemade soup, salad and breadstick lunch available until 4 p.m. daily for $6.95.

An olive branch on menu items signified low-fat entrees. There is a Garden Fare Nutrition Guide available for customers seeking gluten-free food. And for those with food allergies, Olive Garden has an Allergen Information Guide.

All in all, it is the largest and most beautiful restaurant now operating in Scottsdale. It attracts visitors from out of town as well as people who live here.

Olive Garden is part of the Darden chain of restaurants that also operates Red Lobster. There are about 700 restaurants, including four Olive Gardens in North Dakota's major cities.

Olive Garden has gained a following since 1982 with its ample portions and relaxed ambience. It's known for its classic lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken Parmigiana.

The waitress sounded knowledgeable and helpful in picking out a wine and suggesting some things on the menu. Though the wine she suggested was $20 more than the one we picked originally and we didn't realize until the bill.. oh well. We were told the wine was a fairly dry wine, but really it was pretty sweet and fruity and didn't have much of a pucker factor as far as dryness. I liked it, since I don't mind a sweeter wine, but it wasn't exactly what we were looking for especially for $20 more than expected.

Per our waitresses suggestion, we started with the Ouzo Cured Salmon which was supposedly the best thing on the menu. It was just okay. The dish was sliced salmon on top of some shaved fennel with a dollop of Tzatziki on the side. We ended up asking for some pita to put it on since we were sharing, and it was a small plate.

For an entree we both chose 7oz boneless fillets. I got the Ahi Tuna, he got the Chilean Seabass. They are both $5 an ounce. I didn't try his, but he said it was good and mostly because it was very buttery - haha. The Ahi Tuna was good, and cooked correctly. The fish entrees do not come with sides, so we added one each. He got the Moroccan Mechouia which was decent I suppose, but he got it without peppers due to allergy so I won't comment on that. I, however, got the Kamut & Freekeh Risotto with wild mushrooms and kefalotiri cheese which ended up being a huge disappointment for me. This was not risotto, at least not what I'm used to. I was told after, that it's an ""ancient grain"" risotto - whatever that means. It was the consistency of corn with some cream in it. I was expecting a thick creamy risotto... if you're looking for that, don't get this. I did not finish it, it was basically a bowl of beans. 

We finished with Baklava ice cream for dessert, which was exactly that, a scoop of ice cream with a piece of baklava on top. We chose to get a shot of espresso to dump over top of it which was delicious. 

In all, the bill was $190 before tip. For this atmosphere and that price, I would have expected to be wowed or at least satisfied, but I wasn't. Im not sure if I'll be back any time soon unless someone suggests it.",2015-11-28 17:08:35

This place reminds me more of San Diego and not the Bahamas. Service here isn't consistent. Good servers, bad servers and the in-betweens. The food is quite average. I've had great meals when I went to Bahamas so I'd always hope they'd remind me of my trip. They have conch fritters but it's disappointing. I must say their drinks are pretty solid though. Here's some that I've tried: 

Yaka Hula Hickey Dula:
Riesling, pineapple juice and dark rum. I like pineapple/pineapple juice, I like Riesling, rum is ok. Nice fruity but strong drink. 5/5

Ultimate Pina Colada:
Captain Morgan rum, strawberry and pineapple ice and dark rum. It's like drinking a smoothie - not much alcohol here. 4/5

Crispy Onion Rings:
Large onions rings breaded with Panko and coconut flakes. The sauce is a sweet mustard...I'm not a fan. 2/5

Coconut Shrimp:
Shrimps breaded with coconut flakes, citrus-mustard sauce on the side. This is supposed to be a best-seller. I'm still not a fan. 2/5

Beef Empanadas:
Fried dough filled with beef and potatoes.  Comes with mango salsa and a dipping sauce. Forgettable. 2/5

Tostones with Chicken:
Fried plantains with sweet peppers, mushrooms, chicken, cheese and tomato salsa. Biggest mistake and probably the worst item on the menu. I love tostones and this was a major let down. There's so much going on with this dish. 1/5

Shrimp Creole Bowl, Chicken Curry:
Nothing to write home about. 2/5

Chicken Tortilla Soup:
Chicken breast, tortilla strips, carrots, roasted corn, avocado and lime. This is my go-to menu item when I don't feel like wasting my calories. 4/5

Big Island:
Chocolate mousse, brownie, milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise. Chocolate mousse and vanilla anglaise are yummy...the brownie, not so much. 4/5

Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside Down Cake:
Warm chocolate cake with a pineapple ring on top and a molten chocolate center, raspberry sauce and fruits on the side. I love pineapple, I love chocolate but I do not love this dessert. If there's rum in this cake, it would've been delicious. 3/5

I've come here and have tried a lot of things on their menu but I just couldn't find anything that's good. I only come here for the liquid diet: soup and alcohol...and maybe the Big Island too. I'm just not in love with this place at all.",2013-09-23 20:07:11

I was amazed at how many new stores opened up at the glitzy high-end Biltmore Fashion Park in the short amount of time that I've been gone. It's an outdoor upscale shopping venue, so I was pleased to see a place where you could buy a drink to walk around with.

The tiny cafe is in the Union corridor.  Big bright open windows provide plenty of light and decor reminded me of a few modern European cafe's.  Lots of white, clean lines...think Scandinavian. Outdoor seating was available too. 

The menu featured several varieties of juices  (but not all available on this visit). Also on the menu were my favorite Acai bowls.

We walked up to the counter to order but all the employees were busy making juices but no one really taking orders. My first impression was. ""Hmm, this is not a happy staff"". They all were a bit stoic and pretentious. No one turned around for a while to smile, to welcome you, to say we will be right with you...blah blah blah... I thought well, we are the Biltmore Fashion Park so levels of snooty service are par for the course.

We ordered some fresh pressed juices but it was slim pickings. We were told several juices were not available. My guess is they ran out of the ingredients? 

My juice was very good-it was a green juice with pineapple-I can't remember the name but it was similar to my experience here-forgettable.

I guess I have to start with the breadsticks. They give you bunches of them like it's raining breadsticks. Not all but most of the people at my table liked them but I thought they tasted a frozen dough product. One bite was enough for me as I didn't taste real garlic or a tasty oil on them.

The salad was sort of average with a what seemed like bottled dressing on it. They give you all you want and grate cheese on it for you.

I had the Apricot Chicken that's on the new Healthy Menu. The chicken wasn't as bad as that spongy Subway kind of chicken. I'm not sure if it was precooked and reheated or just over marinated because of the odd texture. It didn't taste fresh cooked but might have been. It seemed like it was cooked in a press of some sort. The asparagus and broccoli were nice and fresh but 100% unseasoned and just steamed. This dish tasted salt free and was slightly sweet.

We arrived around 6:45 pm and the patio was full. They offered us the back patio which we agreed on as we were already hungry. The back patio is definitely not as nice as the front one. There's no view and we felt like the dumpster was probably close by.

We all started off with an appetizer that was shared amongst each other. We shared the mussels in white wine, scallops, and crab cakes. I was very disappointed with the scallops. For almost $13 there were only four scallops on the plate! That's ridiculously priced I must say. If I knew there would only be four scallops I definitely wouldn't have ordered it. Our server was good during our stay. However, we all felt that she should've written our orders down because it didn't come out right. My sister and friend both had changes to their original orders which weren't easy to remember. As soon as the server was summarizing our orders she already had it wrong. Our entrees came out quite fast which was nice as were hungry. However, my sister's order came out wrong so it was sent back. I enjoyed the seafood linguini that I ordered. They didn't cheap out on the seafood as there were plenty to eat. It came with shrimp, mussels, scallops, and clams. I definitely shouldn't have ordered the scallops to start off with.

At Haji-Baba the exquisite architecture and the scantily-clad waitresses, don't get factored into your bill. Basically because there aren't any.

It's basically a dive attached to a market.

I love the decor at Pita Jungle but I can't make that justify the food prices.

You can order a appetizer at Haji's that can serve as your meal or just a simple gyro which comes served in tin foil.

The iced tea is great and the baklava comes in more flavors than Baskin Robbins has ice cream.

This place is also a fave of many college students.

One thing I can't understand about Haji's is the service. It's kinda like they don't care. Clearing tables is more important to them than taking care of patrons already at a table. Many times I've gotten up and refilled my own drink.

The pizza was just great!  We split a large specialty pizza - one half was broccoli rabe and sausage and the other half was meatball and ricotta.  The crust was thin and just lightly burnt from the purported coal fire and the toppings were plentiful and delicious.  I would say that the topping choices on the specialty pizza offerings are very well thought out and gave us plenty of reason to return to branch out a little and try a couple of other combinations.  So, there ends the 4 star portion.

On to the rest:
- The seating area is very small.  This place is deceptively large - when you get in, there is a tiny bar area and only about seating for 50 or so.  We had a 20 minute wait and thankfully the food was worth it.
- Service was pretty off.  For a Monday night, they were so clearly understaffed.  So, long waits for simple requests like more water, extra napkins, silverware for our party of 4, and our check.
- The restaurant itself is hot.  I mean, how could it not be when ""coal fired pizza"" is in the name?  But, better ventilation would make the dine in experience go a lot smoother.",2012-06-12 17:02:55

I had been looking forward to coming to tako for months. My expectations were basically through the roof by the time I got there after all the praises I had heard for the food, so I was hoping it wouldn't disappoint. Let me tell you...it didn't! Tako is extremely small, but the atmosphere is so, so cool. You honestly feel like you're stepping into a different world when you enter; you completely forget that you're in downtown Pittsburgh. The lighting is pretty dark, but it really sets the mood. There are only about seven tables on the ground floor, and then a few more tables up on a second floor loft. I love the fact that the kitchen is right at the front of the restaurant, so you can see the chefs making all the delicious food. The music is a little loud and I felt that I was almost yelling to talk to my friends, but the food was so good I didn't even care.

We started with a round of drinks - we all got either the red or white sangria. I tasted both, and would highly recommend the red over the white, even if you're partial to white wine. The red sangria had a lot more depth of flavor than the white. Next, we did the ""build your own guac,"" which was basically my dream come true as guacamole is one of my favorite foods of all time. We did the classic guacamole and added bacon to it. One of the best guacs I've ever had. Also, the chips were phenomenal and came out piping hot and very fresh. Next we put in an order of the famous ""papas bravas,"" which I noticed a few people had mentioned on Yelp. Oh my goshhhh they were PHENOMENAL. The potatoes themselves were crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside. There was some sort of tangy sauce on the bottom of the skillet with a hint of sweetness, and the aioli on top was more salty. Top that off with some scallions, and I was in heaven. I was so happy at that point that I would have given tako five stars even before trying the tacos.

I was tempted to order the octopus taco, but I decided to try the chicken since it was my first time and I wanted to see tako's take on the classic chicken taco. Oh man. I was already pretty full from our appetizers, but I scarfed both of my tacos down in record time. The mixture of the flavors is just amazing, and no one flavor overpowers any other. I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life, but these were the best tacos I've ever had. I am not exaggerating. If you haven't been here yet, please make a reservation and try it out ASAP. Your tummy will thank you!",2016-01-26 13:24:03

Dora here. What a gorgeous day! Too nice to sit inside and what a comfortable, relaxing outdoor space! They certainly live up to their creed, ""A tapestry of flavor, color, aromas and textures happening in a joyous and friendly atmosphere."" As usual, we arrived super early, but this patio was jammed by the time we left.

For my meal, I ordered the Antojitos, an assortment of foods one might find on the streets of Mexico City, and the selection changes daily. Today, it included Nachos, Tlayudas (sometimes referred to as Mexican Pizza), Pig Wings Carnitas, and Salmon wraps. All four of these items were great, but my favorite was the Pig Wings Carnitas, pork shanks flash fried and tossed in an orange caramel sauce. As you can probably tell, they were crispy on the outside and full of favor. The salmon wrap was packed with fish, very tasty, and my second favorite.

Dora here. I don't usually choose to eat Mexican food because I tend to overeat. Shocker, I know, but those chips, y'all!! I could eat an entire basket by myself, especially here, where both the chips and salsa were soooo good. Just a little kick in the salsa and tomatoey thick. Yum! The Chicken Chimichanga was plump with chicken, black beans, and rice and a smattering of corn and cheese. Delicious, one of the best I've ever eaten, with all my favorite ingredients, and the slaw was a perfect accompaniment to add depth and crunch. I did not finish it, but I didn't leave the table feeling stuffed, either. What I really enjoyed about this dish was the fresh flavor.

This is one of our to go list restaurant for a while and its nice to finally get to try out this place. We came in and they offered to hang up our jacket, but we declined b/c we were goose jackets and didn't want it misplaced for any reason.

Sat in a small deuce table for me and my gf. We opted for just the meal plan with a soda and coffee, so I guess the server was not too pleased with 'those type of customer' haha

My gf got the sardines and I got the grilled squid/octopus. I can tell the portions are smaller than their regular a la carte for certain but its okay to get a taster.
The sardines were a nice new app we've never tried in a restaurant setting before and it tasted fine. I thought it was good. The grilled squid and octopus was fine as well. I felt the octopus tasted better but the squid was a bit more fresh.

Their service is hands-on type and they replace your cutlery for each course which is a nice touch. One funny note, after our apps, they gave us a small fork and a teaspoon, and brought our desserts! I figured that when they cleared our apps, they would notice the mains would be next, but somehow was clueless about that.

Anywho...Our mains came and my gf got the 'Duck Confit'. Giant duck leg which was meaty and filling for her. I got their skate wing fish! For those that don't know about this fish, its Stingray! Sharks favourite food and they are the sea creature with the long tail barb. The skate fish is very nice with the scales removed. The meat is very tender and easy to chew and digest. Easily better choice than some fishes out there.

Desserts we got the gingerbread cake and chocolate cherry tart. Both, I'd say were disappointing in terms of size and the taste. Imagine getting leftover end pieces of a pie. The taste was nothing special about it.

Overall this place gets a 3.5/5 score. I may come back again for this place, only b/c there are few good portuguese restaurants.",2014-02-14 08:12:55

I wouldn't say they are the best taco option but if you are in that area and want a wonderful vibe with a great bar, give it a shot!

I'm not one to be negative or point fingers - but my experience over the last few months has been less than 5 stars.

First, over payment of rent. I take responsibility for paying ""double"" rent for 4 months. Yeah , 4 months. My mother fell ill in June and passed away in July. I suppose I was wanted to be sure I paid,due to personal issues in my life. Turnberry never asked me to refund my payments, nor offered any compensation / interest on the $8,000 rent they had. This continued on and I finally asked them to refund my rent, which was like pulling teeth - it took weeks for them to do this, but I finally was able to get 2 months rent back. Loosing a parent and taking care of my 86 year old father was and still is the most difficult thing I've had to deal with. No compassion by the bean counters at Turnberry.

I've been asking about renewing my lease / increase since November. I was told Dec 15 I would have info. That never happened and I eventually was told I would have a 10% increase on a month to month and a huge increase in a lease. This makes zero sense to me!

Since Oct I have a new nieghbor. She decides to move furniture or ""bowl"" between 10pm and 4am every evening. I am also privileged to hear arguments with her boyfriend for hours as she clicks across the apartment in her high heels, in addition to hearing her poor dog crying - my guess is she leaves the poor little dog outside in 40 degree weather because she's to busy moving furniture or arguing with her boyfriend. I lost it the other night and screamed off the balcony and asked her to please respect me downstairs and not move furniture at 10-11pm. I'm pretty patient since this has been a 3 month on going situation. Who moves furniture in the middle of the night, every night? It's wrong!!!!!

Today I went to speak to management about my lease , increase and address the 10pm-5am furniture mover and aminal abuser. 

They were ""sorry"" but couldn't address  my issues because management is changing and the new person won't be back until next week. In addition, my rent is going up about $400 to be comparable to ""market"" value. Market value us not $2500-$2700 a month for a 2 bedroom apt! Sadly if I do a month to month my rent increases 10%.

It had been a while since my last wax so she had a pretty good canvas to work with. I explained to her exactly how i wanted them (clean yet manly), and she totally nailed it!

WIdrFlQ4obC4NAv_R6r72g,SEZVQUIxNukcowUAR14VUQ,8cjXEmuqgCbIRudb2D52qw,5,14,12,8,"Dim sum on a weekday for lunch? Can you dig it, Madison?  I knew that you could!  Made our first visit here for a lunch on the West side. So glad we decided to try something new.  I had not been a fan of dim sum here in Madison up until today.  The quality always seemed lacking and timing was never quite right as they always only seemed to serve on the weekends.  I gave up trying a number of years ago and have long wondered if things may have changed since. At least they certainly did with the addition of Nani. 

I knew Nani opened a few months back but was reluctant to try them given our prior middling dim sum experiences here in town. In addition, they took over a space which previously housed a number of Chinese buffets, the last few of which were pretty bad and garishly decorated (lots of brass and mirrors).  Ugh.  Admittedly, I let our poor experiences from the past color our reluctance to visit Nani up until now.  My bad. 

Needing something different to try, we stopped in and were very pleasantly surprised. Their revamped space is beautiful and modernish. Darker woods, sleek lines and subtle lighting really add to the ambience.  Mind you, this is not your grandparents' chop suey house.  Accented by their white linens, it is a largish, handsome, understated and elegant space.  Refined, subtle, warm and inviting but not cheesy. I believe they even have a bar and an area where diners can eat and watch the chefs work.  The space is very well laid out and, I would think, would easily accommodate our more mobility challenged dining friends using a cane, walker or wheelchair.  They have a large parking lot with ample parking, too!

We were warmly and promptly greeted and offered drinks. Bubble teas were a must. Cold and with ample tapioca beads, they were a great start to lunch.

For those unfamiliar with dim sum dining, it is essentially the Chinese version of Spanish tapas dining--smaller plates and bites of unique savory, spicy, salty and/or sweet dishes, well-suited to solo or group dining. Modestly priced, you can try a number of things without breaking the bank!  Also, I think dim sum can reflect the diversity and history of Chinese cooking in dishes which can be simple yet very sophisticated; bold yet sublime; and new, yet familiar.  Nani did not disappoint and reminds me of the dim sum I had growing up in Chinatown in Honolulu made by Chinese cooks shouting in Chinese served by Chinese ladies pushing carts stacked with bamboo steamers around ginormous round tables filled with hungry locals fighting to get their faves. Authentic?  Can't vouch. But Nani's are not the tastes of Americanized shopping mall food court Chinese food. 

They must have at least 30 to 40 different dim sum available. They also have a large entrée menu. I did not see a specific lunch menu. So entrées seemed on the expensive side for lunch. Dim sum prices ranged between approximately $4-6 dollars each, with a few a little more. The dim sum menu is well done with pictures and English descriptions!   They have items which range from the classic standards (pork and shrimp dumplings and egg rolls) to that which are more challenging for the American palate (braised chicken feet). But no one should be put off. There are plenty of choices for every taste and budget.

For us, pork and shrimp dumplings, vegetable crepes, soup dumplings, pork and vegetable buns, sticky rice wrapped in taro leaves, spare ribs with black beans, and egg custard tarts were all on our lunch menu.  They were all excellent, particularly the pork and vegetable bun dough  and egg custard tart pastry which were as light and delicate as any I have ever had.  Wowza!  

Important notes - - 1) they also roast their own whole duck in the restaurant.  Definitely a delicious must try; and 2) despite having other kitchen talent available, another diner shared that the owner actually cared enough about the cuisine to delay the restaurant's opening by two months until he could secure and persuade the particular chefs he wanted from San Francisco to come to Nani in Madison.  

Service was excellent. Everyone was helpful and patient as we hemmed and hawed over the menu and asked questions. Our water glasses were always filled and empty plates promptly cleared.  

Portions are ample. We were absolutely stuffed with plenty of leftovers. With two bubble teas and before gratuity, our total was about $44. We overdid it, so people with better judgment and control will likely spend less but be just as satiated.

I think Nani does dim sum and restaurant service right.  They are a wonderful addition to our Madison restaurant community.  That Nani is managed by a young Millenial with traditional tastes yet forward minded restaurant and thoughtful customer service skills will not surprise you.  

Free your mind (and your belt buckle) and your @&& will follow.  I did and was pleasantly surprised. I hope you will be too.  See you there!",2016-04-30 04:35:52

I remember the work as being at least OK ... and the staff being customer-oriented.

But, like Polished Too, these non-pedi-station chairs, were a bit of an issue for me.

While those chairs look very very comfy ... and, as a big fat chair, they are ... they become a bit awkward to sit in when you have to scoot up to let them use an unattached bowl in which to soak you for your pedi. 

And, of course, the bowl isn't going to be quite as large or accommodating as a regular pedi station's basin. 

YMMV.

But for me, after having experienced chair+bowl at several venues, both in Vegas and back on the East Coast, I have pretty much now settled in on the notion that a regular pedi station just functions better.

It is a pretty good sized burro - I couldn't finish it all - and trust me, I tried.  I ordered it a la carte - there is a combo option - but again, it's a huge burro...

The only time I have ever disliked something here was when I ordered the Thom Yum vegetarian, but other than that.... LOVE the Thom Yum and the Thom Ka- great with chicken (and I hate chicken), really good with shrimp. The last time I ate here the shrimp seemed to be a lot better quality than a few years ago- so I'm pretty stoked for that, because a lot of places have really gross shrimp in Phoenix... you know that mushy shrimp that just seems icky... icky... right? That describes it? Icky shrimp. The shrimp they served me last time were plump and juicy and really good.

The fried rice dishes, excellent. The curries... pretty darn good. Pad Thai... yum... Cashew dishes, basil dishes... all GOOD. We always order extra veggies on just about everything and they always happily accommodate us with excellent fresh, perfectly al dente.

The area where you can find this awesome Thai restaurant may be described as pretty much, super ghetto- and beware, one day the guy that owns the liquor store next door came out and picked a fight with us for parking in front of his store, when he was closed for the day... That dudes a dick.

But, really, if you are on the West Side- this is definitely a good spot. I used to think Thai Rama was the stuff, but I think I prefer Siam now... Sorry Thai Rama.

My one gripe. Every single time I eat here, I ask for extra chili paste because my guy can't handle as much heat as me, so we end up ordering everything medium for his Caucasian palate- every single time they forget to bring the chili paste. But, what are you going to do? They will eventually bring it, we just have to ask again. My boyfriend said he figured out the secret- you have to ask for the chili paste when they bring your food out, or they will always forget.

They have cute little baskets with decadent different croissants and breads and have prices scattered around on little pop up cards. Everything is more expensive than usual but after trying their almond croissant I can understand why. The croissant was on the flat side and was very flakey but it had just the right amount of almond butter inside it and made the walk home that much more enjoyable.

All of the buffets in Vegas have gone up and this one is no exception.  For about $18 you get a decent buffet.  They do not have the variety of say the Rio but the quality is better.

It is only a short drive away from the Strip and for only a $7 fee you can witness one of nature's true beauties. A scenic drive here is worth the price of admission and more. But our scenic drive was ruined, hence the three star review.

Though I understand the reasoning for the park patrol doing their job, they were especially out in force on this Sunday in the middle of August. Our friend received a $200 ticket for doing 48 in a 35 mph zone just because they were driving a supercar, specifically a McLaren C12. We were following them and they were not driving recklessly at all and really were going about the same speed as the rest of traffic. Just a shame because the Red Rock Canyon has some of the nicest paths to take a car of that caliber. It just put a whole damper on the rest of the drive. 

Shorty after that, the park patrol ticketed a motorcyclist within a span of 10 minutes. Then a red Lamborghini sped off after witnessing our friend get pulled over likely giddy over the fact that they dodged a bullet. 

The cherry on top was having to deal with a certain car who inexplicably kept stopping in the middle of the road or driving 10mph. As an Asian, I think its okay for me to say ""get it together FOBs!"" 

Had I seen tortoises I'm sure this review would be five stars easy. But alas, the only shells we encountered was a shellacking by the park rangers. 

I'd like to come back and explore the rest of this park someday but I'd caution those hoping to bring their nice cars here to be more discreet in their color scheme of their ride. While orange sure attracts a lot of people wanting to take photos with the car (I counted at least a dozen or so strangers taking photo-ops in and around the car), its also a homing mechanism for the park rangers. 

In no way am I advocating speeding, but these are just my opinions.",2014-08-19 22:48:23

When arriving home we couldn't wait to try the picture perfect specimens before us..we cut each one in half so each of us could sample all. The best of the bunch was the baked apple.

I love how they don't promote a specific brand, yet offer education to the customer.  

I spent quite a bit of time talking to Katt (yes... her name is really Katt) about my dog and her scratching.  She's always current on flea medicine, and I thought I was giving her a good brand of food.  After talking a bit, she suggested (and followed up with documentation for me to take home) that my sweet dog might have a corn allergy, which is common in dogs.  Well, heck, I'll bite.  I was sent home with a bag of food to try, along with another half bag of various samples.  Money back guarantee.  

It's only been a week, but I'm carefully watching for changes.  After doing more online research, I found that Katt was dead on with her facts.  Now, whether that really is MY dog's issue... we'll see in a couple weeks.  

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention their brand of doggie bags.  They are the most inexpensive ones I've every found.  They are biodegradable.  They are the ugliest green you'll find ever.  (I like the cute pink and purple bags for my girl, but I'm willing to try new things.)  These bags are AWESOME.  They never tear, they perforate perfectly (try saying that a few times fast), and they have a mild scent.  The dispenser is the best quality I've ever found.  I think it might be bullet proof.  I've lost containers to some dumb things:  getting slammed in a car door, getting caught on a boat dock and cracking open, the fastener breaking, you name it.  I think I might have paid $3 for it.

Anyways, unlike the other popular paint events, Paint Nite does theirs at a restaurant/bar type of place and ours was at View Wine Bar & Kitchen. They had the canvases scattered throughout a roped section of the restaurant. Funny thing is, they ask their patrons to arrive 15 minutes early, yet they themselves weren't ready to have us seated (kind of ironic I thought). The instructor (I forgot her name, maybe it was Linda?) was funny and tried to loosen everyone up. She made a lot of kinky references during her initial instruction. I thought it was kind of awkward at some points considering most of the people there were middle aged women, but none the less still funny. As we were painting we began to notice our paintings looked nothing like the original painting from the website. The reason why we chose this particular night was because we wanted to attempt to replicate the original. The instructor was definitely carefree and just wanted everyone to have fun. My friend who had been to other ones (Design & Wine and Wine & Canvas) said they are more detailed when giving instructions, which results to a better replicate of the original painting. If you just want to have fun and don't really care about the end result is come to Paint Nite.

This place is really small for a club so I think it should be under the lounge category. The ambiance of this place is really nice. The dance floor is a little small and if you don't have table service, this place can really blow. 

Good: Great lounge and quick service.

Bad: This place is a bit small.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and they even have a toy/game shelf section provided for you! Sometimes they play Charlie Chaplin silent movies and also very chill old style music. So recommendations! Their scones are absolutely delicious. Flaky, and soft inside texture. I like to order a plain scone and a sausage which they have daily different choices each day. Ask the waiter for those choices! Also the meat platter for 2 which is 14 dollars is really great too. OR anything on their menu really...can't go wrong. For example breakfast burrito, grilled cheese things...etc

Some friends of mine have been talking about this place and of course it's way too far for me to go for pizza but since we had a special occasion going on, this is the location they picked and I was glad to finally be able to get my hands on a piece of pie. We went commando on this place! We ordered the buffalo fries which were amazing. I was trying to lick the tin they came out of, they were that good. We then ordered two of the appetizer breads, one was the cheesy bread which was my favorite and the other one was like sesame seeds which was pretty good as well but for me the cheesy bread took the cake. We ordered the super supreme pizza as well as the super meat pizza. You could tell how fresh the ingredients were. The green peppers were outstanding and crisp, the pepperoni was cut fresh. 
Overall I was super impressed with this place and I really wish they were a lot closer to me on the east side of town. The owners seem awesome, everybody is super friendly and very attentive. Tons of TVs you can watch whatever you want, we even had them change the channel for us on one of the tele's. They've got a full bar, plenty of drink options. Take out or dine in.

There are a variety of meal deals, as well as wings by the pound. Takes about 15 minutes for an order to be ready. 

When we stopped in to get takeout, there was exactly one staffer working. She was very pleasant and friendly.

The restaurant itself has a rundown, dive feel to it, and it's rather tiny. This is really a spot meant for takeout, not dining in.

We ordered 2 pounds of wings (which come with 1-2 flavor choices) and seasoned fries, with ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces. There are several flavors of varying heat levels to choose from - everything from super hot to Hawaiian to lemon pepper. We went with cajun and buffalo hot (they're 2nd and 3rd spiciest according to the menu).

The wings were alright. Good size. Ok quality. Neither flavor was spicy at all - both were very mild. I perhaps would've liked the wings better if I'd ordered them wet. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces were decent - better than what you get at most places.

The fries were...fries. Cooked well, seasoned well. Tasty enough.

Overall, the jury is still somewhat out on this place. It was better than I was expecting. I'm hoping a spicier flavor and ordering them wet will give me the wings I'm searching for.",2015-01-12 19:59:35

This wouldn't be a place to take your first date. It's a group dining experience and it's loud. Loud enough that shouting becomes your main way of talking, and then you forget how to talk softly. I'm not even sure how the servers hear us. 

Food was really good. And well priced. Lots of small appetizers to choose from, and really, you could make a meal out of it by just choosing the small dishes and sharing with one or two other people. 

For the two of us, we ordered 2 antipasti and one main course to share, and it was enough with still room for some dessert. 
The Giant Meatball was excellent. I don't know what was in the sauce, or what's in the meatball but I wanted another one. 
The grilled calarmari was also good (not spectacular) but flavourful and soft, yet still crunchy.  ($8.95-$11)

Our main was the slow cooked beef ribs with pan fried gnocchi. I did expect a bed of gnocchi but there were only 4. And they were undercooked and difficult to eat. BUT, the beef ribs was amazeballs. Falling off the bone, even had some tendon to suck on. The sauce was my favourite. 

The service was interesting. Our server was not extra attentive, just enough. We were also sitting right in the middle of the restaurant and it's hard to miss us.

At some point in the meal, we for plates that we were told was pulled pork and something else. Then about 5 minutes later the busboy came and took it away: it was neither pulled pork or for our table. 

However, our server did play along when I was asking for a pretend dessert but really planning a birthday surprise. I guess that's twhere they loudness came into my advantage. 

Our bill couldn't be separate, even by groups. How disappointing. 

The wines we got (reds, 2 different ones) were watery tasting. A coffee connoisseur at the table gave the espresso a 3 out of 5 as the flavour wasn't rich enough. 

Yah, I'd come back . Just the loudness factor really takes away from a good meal.",2011-08-07 14:05:39

Apparently the bottom line was not doing well and there were changes in personnel. They also cut back the number of servers and it appears they also changed the prices. The biggest change that we noticed was in the service. We were in the restaurant for an hour and a half. We did get our salad after considerable amount of time. They never did manage to get to bring out our shrimp cocktail before we had to leave. Our server was very apologetic. However, the restaurant now being shortstaffed should not be my problem. Our water glasses were never refilled. We asked for a refill on the bread. It never came. Even trying to get the bill required that I ambush a food runner going to another table and telling him we were leaving and needed to have a check immediately. The price was also quite different than the last time we were here. The wedge salad alone was priced at $17.50. While it was quite good, it was not a $17.50 good salad!

Um... sure... they played nothing but Okean Elzy the entire hour we were there. It's ok though - I still come and stock up on their pelmeni from the store every now and then. Freshest in town!

While generally their food is awesome, and they advertise gluten free (and it's more than just salad) when I was here for Super Bowl it was weird. I ordered a quesadilla, as a) it was a gluten free one and b) I wasn't feel super pubby food. What they call a quesadilla is layers of corn tortillas with stuff on, stacked on each other. WTF?! So it was messy to eat, the food kept falling out and it was a disaster. I have no idea why they would do that, but it wasn't a good time. And too many onions. Cute how the fries coming in mini fryers. 

I've had a fair amount of their food, but only the quesidilla on this occasion. The cider was great and the burgers looked good.

My dad would love this place, we were at Carrabas one time and he wanted fettuccine Alfredo with Italian sausage...they waiter looked at him like he had two heads. Anywho, pick your  type of pasta, pick a sauce (my favorites are the meaty Bolognese or the creamy Rose), and then various veggie toppings and meat toppings (their meatballs are really good, moist and flavorful).

So, we've agreed the Pasta's good here...But, I really wanted to try Sauce's pizza on my next visit. Just so happens, the wife wanted to come here for a sort of belated birthday lunch. Cool.

Boy, lunchtime on a Sunday at Sauce was pretty dead, I think our party was the only ones there...anyway, perusing the menu I saw something called the Italian Chimichanga, our waitress said it was new item on the menu. I know I came here with every intention of trying their pizza, but I couldn't pass this up. A giant deep-fried burrito stuffed with sausage, meatballs, ham, mushrooms and cheese. Then topped with a marinara and pesto sauce (to emulate red and green enchilada sauces), and sprinkled with Feta cheese (I guess to look like Queso fresco?). Sounds interesting, right? It was delicious, kind of like a less doughy Stromboli or calzone. As far as apps, we had the Mac and cheese balls (also new on menu, crispy fried and topped withe combo of marinara and alfredo sauce), pretty good...and the Garlic knots, tossed with olive oil, garlic and Parmesan cheese, yum.

I would've gave Sauce another star, but dang it, I have still yet to try their pizza!",2015-05-04 00:16:16

The sausages that they make in-house are excellent. We've had the pumpkin sage, chicken chorizo, raspberry jalapeño and chicken basil sausages. All worth trying. Our favorite is definitely the chicken chorizo, but it's often hard to get when we drop in closer to closing time. Fortunately, you can call in an order for pickup ahead of time if you know what you need and you're not going to make it in until later. We're actually huge fans of getting the chicken chorizo out of the casing and using it for things like tacos. It's awesome stuff, and highly recommended!

We've tried t-bones, ny strips, and filet mignon. You order your steaks by the width and they'll cut them to order. We also love that they'll cut the fat off of the meat, so you end up paying for mostly the quality meat, and not a bunch of scrap. 

Speaking of paying, the prices are really good. Gerber's Amish chicken breasts are cheaper there than basically anywhere else that we get them. We typically stop in for all of our meat-based needs, but DJ's also offers milk and eggs from local farms for good prices, as well.

With a great, helpful staff, you definitely feel the neighborhood vibe of the shop. Just know that it's a small shop, so things can run out quickly. If you're looking to stock up on tailgating needs or even a few specific items, try to call ahead. Stopping in on a whim, or later in the day may leave you walking away without your favorite meats!",2013-11-04 02:08:43

I ordered the spicy lemongrass chicken with rice. This was not the special of the day, I just felt like their chicken was Godly and I also love spicy food so I gave this dish a try. The only thing I was disappointed about was probably the fact that it wasn't a chicken ""steak"" like the first time I ordered it, instead it was bite sized cubes of chicken. This is just personal preference, however, the food and chicken was still excellent! 

They did not disappoint! If it says spicy, it should be spicy, and it definitely was spicy! It wasn't numbing, it wasn't weak, it was just right. It also had a nice balance of salt and sweetness to it. It was also not overloaded with peppers like some places do. There was a fair bit of chicken, good chicken! The chicken was cut and cooked to perfection. The rice was also perfect. The side of raw vegetables (cucumber and carrots and radish I believe) could've used a bit more work, but I can't complain much. The cucumber was not dressed in anything (maybe some people like that, but I think there should be something added to it like a sweet and sour vinaigrette) but they carrot and radish was bomb as it had a good PUNCH of flavour to it. Excuse my language. 

I went with friends this time and the owner of the place (I think he's the owner, and I think he's called Kai? However I'm not sure) talked with us for a while and told us about how he wants to expand this restaurant and start serving more university students and even people working on Bay Street. We also talked about advertising opportunities without sounding too serious and had a good and friendly conversation for a short period of time. I think this was a nice touch. 

I am giving it 4 stars this time simply because compared to the first time I went it was worse. But don't get me wrong, it was still delicious! And I am definitely coming back, which I most definitely did... Stay tuned for my next review of Jack Tan's (coming VERY soon).",2015-06-26 23:14:14

My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday for happy hour. They seated us at a two person table which was fine, but the restaurant wasn't very busy and the table got pretty full after ordering 3-4 starters, chips, salsa, drinks, and the candle on the table. It took a little while for our server to greet us and she didn't mention happy hour until we did, but after that everything ran smoothly. 

The $5 Bandito margaritas are a great price and strong. We got a free guacamole for checking in on Yelp (apparently there's a specific ""Yelp guacamole"". It looks small but tasted great and lasted surprisingly long. For starters we shared the ceviche, sopes sampler, and chicken tinga flautas. All starters are 1/2 off during appetizers so another steal. The sopes and the flautas were amazing, especially the flautas. They're like mini quesadillas wrapped up like egg rolls and stuffed with cheesy chicken. They serve it with a red enchilada sauce and another sauce I couldn't identify but both were really good. 

The only dish I didn't care for much was the ceviche. I bit into what felt like glass, and while examining it the host came over and told me it was probably salt and took it away. The did have some big black pieces of salt on the dish, but the pieces I bit into were clear and had black markings on it so I don't know. I didn't want to eat any more of the ceviche just in case but I didn't care for it much to start with. It seemed overly fragrant, almost floral.

I will try to avoid this In-N-Out because the lines are always long.  Besides, I have an In-N-Out less than a mile from my house.  The food is still good at this location and I highly recommend their Double Double, with extra spread, and extra toast.  It's less than $5 and bargain.  My recent meals at this In-N-Out have been two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties / 4 slices of cheese).  It's so good that I can eat 10 of these.  This In-N-Out is located next door to a Cracker Barrel.  I will even see peeps leave the Cracker Barrel and head to In-N-Out.

When we walked in, there isn't a booth at the front or really anywhere to wait but we were acknowledged and seated pretty much straight away. The decor is pretty simple but around the edges of the restaurant they have little roofs and street signs named after Vietnamese food that honour the restaurant's name. 
We ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls to start and they came with an amazing peanut/ satay dip which went perfectly! The rolls themselves were tasty and unlike others I have had around the valley, they don't skimp on the meat. Yay!
As a light snack we also shared the Grilled Lemongrass beef rice noodle which was definitely a generous portion for the price. The flavours were very subtle so worth dousing it with the fish sauce they provide and it would have been nice if the dish was served hot and with better cuts of meat. I liked the charred, smokey hint to the meat, but there was quite a bit of fat that comes with it, which personally I don't like.
We also ordered a Thai tea that they forgot about. No apology or offer to discount it from the bill, however they did sort it for us straight away and we took it to go.
Just a heads up with the Thai tea: I'm a sweet tooth and like the sweeter made TT's so this one wasn't for me, way too leafy. My partner on the other hand preferred it because of the more leafy, tea-like taste, so depending on what you prefer, it could be your favourite or one to avoid!",2018-06-14 01:27:17

Apart from the crowding and not that great layout, the store leaves up to its name: comprehensively stocked at no frill prices. I have yet to experience a stock out, which is impressive given their constant crowds. Their $1 aisle is fun to plunder. Plus they have a fishmonger and a butcher not far from one another, very Asterix-esque! 

It's very annoying that they don't accept Debit or Visa: only cash or Mastercard, In the 2nd decade of the 21st century who doesn't accept Visa? 

They could also improve the quality of their carry out bags,  they are flimsy to the point that just a can of soup plus a couple other items can rend a hole! What's up with that? I guess it's just a No Frills thing.

Excellent selection of frozen fish and some other meats.

No real comment on service, nothing better or worse than any given day at the grocery store. They do seem to have decent stock on hand every time I am here, so that is a definite plus.

Don't underestimate the places outside atmosphere, you're in a bad neighborhood that's only a stones throw away.

With that said, I'm a fan of Dave and Busters, but I wish they had better methods of removing the kids after 10pm. The also need more staff because when you look for help it's no where to be found when playing a game. The bar inside the arcade is the worst. It's typically one bartender with the manager and it's a bar that need's at least four people tending it. Just go to the bar in the restaurant and you're better off.

I also think they should have someone constantly cleaning the machines. Just going around disinfecting them and maintaining them I think would give this place a nicer touch. 

The food is not bad however, your basic everyday American food with a good price. Beer is cold when it's in bottles which is your best bet when walking around playing games.

We really enjoyed our orders! Half a sushi burrito was a filling size for me. He didn't feel full after his poke bowl because salad isn't as filling as rice or a protein.

We finally gotta tried the French toast cubes but it was totally disappointing. The toast was so oily and greasy and soggy....
For the soup, it was onion soup that night and it was so salty as if salt is free.
Onto the main course, we both had Japanese style pork cutlet don and.... Right away u can tell that it's not crispy because it's light colored rather than golden brown like we first tried it.
And the rice part, so watery it's like eating 泡飯...
In terms of service this time was much nicer. FYI it was a Monday so maybe the mean lady wasn't in on Mondays :p

Conclusion for the three visits: hit or miss. Given the fact that there are so many restaurants out there and the inflation, I'll probably visit somewhere else and come here less often. 

Second time here got an Indonesian style fried rice. The flavor was too strong to my liking. 
And got the free deep fried mushroom which was ok.
But the service wasn't that good. The waitress tried to drop off a dish that we didn't order. And when we said its not ours she still wanna put it down and question us as if we made a wrong order. 
I definitely saw apparent differences in service offered to a frequent patron vs an ordinary customer. More smile, food came out quicker.

This is actually not bad.
To me the menu isn't as extensive (because I skipped the parts about the combo for 2 and combo for four), but it does offer dishes that aren't like typical hk style restaurant?

Came here Friday night at around 615, seated right away.  Ordered a pork cutlet (Japanese style) and a chicken thigh with veggie rice.
Idk..... It somehow gave me some homey feeling..... Lol
The combo comes with a borscht soup and a drink. We upgraded to a cold milk tea and one of the kiko specialty drinks - a hot almond egg white which I really like! Each for a dollar more.

The set was amazing, and I really liked the layout of the theatre. There is a catwalk leading from the stage that kind of has other catwalks coming off of it, and the performers run around them throughout the show, so basically you'll be able to see some close-up action no matter where you sit. The only downside is that if you're at one of the tables in the middle, you might have to turn around and look behind you to see some of the performers at different points. One of my friends warned me of this in advance, so I initially bought tickets to sit in the back theatre section so I wouldn't have to turn around during the show. When we entered, however, one of the kind and thoughtful ushers asked us if we would like to sit on stage instead, so we happily accepted that upgrade. 

We bought a couple of drinks while we were in there; a $5 water (!!!) and 2 $15 cocktails that were very strong and definitely helped us get in the mood for such a fun show. The show itself was amazing. The costumes were great, the singing was superb, the dancers were amazing - everything contributed to a truly incredible show. I liked how the songs were traded back and forth between the three storylines, like ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" was performed by Daisy from the Great Gatsby instead of the girl from Moulin Rouge, which mixed things up a bit. 

This show is perfect for those who love musical theatre and aren't turned off by a good romance (or three, haha). In a city where musicals have been closing left and right, this is a truly incredible show that I hope will have a very long run.",2017-04-11 17:29:53

They have a screen that explains how to order a drink. I didn't know you could choose to have it warm or cold on most of the options.

They've got milktea of the month which provides incentive to try something new. Never thought of getting chocolate flavoured for example, though I just realized they may have forgotten that it was monthly deal...oh well.

Orders are fulfilled quickly, but there's a problem with when they come to take your order. My issue with this location is they offer uber eats, and if a large order comes in, they pretty much drop everything to process the uber order. This includes customers waiting in line. If they've already taken your order they will take care of it first if it's not too time-consuming.

During the course of my stay, an uber order for 8 drinks came in. They stopped taking orders cause the person taking them also went to help make the drinks. Later on, another uber order came in and you can hear the person shout out ""uber order 2 drinks"". They didn't stop the line though for this one

Delivery people came in really quickly, like literally a few minutes later looking for the orders.

Like really, I don't think uber customers deserve higher priority than people that make the effort to come into the store, even if the app is designed so that all parties involved must rush to meet delivery times. But it's good to see that they try their best I suppose to meet those delivery times.",2016-12-30 07:11:15

Eagles Buffet at Casiono Arizona seemed like the obvious choice as I felt like ""real food"" and not just soup and salad, even though it's somewhat of a drive from the far SE valley.  I'm not a gambler, so I'm able to get in and out without being tempted to turn a $10 lunch into a $50 lunch.

I agree with the previous review that it really has a nice atmosphere, more like a dinner restaurant with dim lighting and cozy booths.  Although it's generally crowded at lunchtime, I've never felt uncomfortable as the buffet has a fairly spacious feel with the seating set apart from the buffet itself (similar to LV).  I generally go with a three course meal here including salads, entrees and desserts (trying as many as possible).  So today, here were my selections, all of which tasted superbly fresh and delicious.  Pics attached.

- Spinich salad w/ endive, mandarin oranges, gorgonzola and candied walnuts
- grilled squash/zucchini
- olive assortment
- fresh veggies w/ blue cheese dressing
- cornmeal crusted trout
- halibut w/ cranberry apple chutney
- rice w/ veggies (steamed not fried)
- coucous salad w/ kidney beans
- steamed green beans w/ squash, carrots and red peppers
- key lime pie (just a taste)
- cheesecake w/ candybar topping (same as above)
- chocolate brownie w/ hot fudge and strawberry sauce (same as above)

I ordered the katsu curry (comes with rice and Japanese green salad) for 11.95 and it was a very large portion.  The katsu was crispy but it still had plenty of meat inside, so the breading to meat ratio was perfect.  As for the curry, I don't know if it was using chicken cubes or was packaged or was homemade, and frankly I don't really care because it tastes great.  As my friend said, it would make great drunk food or great hangover food. I think it's great sober comfort food too. 

Verdict: will visit again.  Try it out peeps.

I am in sheeeeer heaven here!  When something bad happens to me and I have to retreat to my ""happy place"" -- Smeeks is where I go in my head.  

Smeeks is the brilliant brain child/offshoot of neighboring Frances Boutique and boasts the best selection of vintage candies, baubles and retro childhood memories.  Over the past 2 months I've admittedly dropped almost 3 Benjamins in this place, because I simply cannot get enough!  Smeeks fueled my holiday shopping for my nieces, me mum and my employees.  I even indulged myself and invested in the most adorable red resin gnome piggybank (that was $50 bucks rite there, but I had to have him!!).

Smeeks has sourced the most excellent assortment of vintage candies & sweets, funky. fun & retro toys & games, kooky Japanese collectibles and they wrap it all up in the most adorable red/white/turquoise finery known to man.  I like to go in and peruse all the cool toys on the wall. I've gotten a package of wax paper drinking straws (total throwback to my childhood).  I've taken fun photos with a friend in their retro black & white 4-spot photobooth.  I've found candies, sweets & gum I haven't seen since i was a kid, like:
- CHARMS Assorted Squares
- Chowards Violet candies
- NECCO wafers
- Cherry Mash
- Pop Rocks
- Wonka Bars
- Wax bottles
- Candy cigarettes
- Double Bubble gum
- Scads more...
And they have their own brand of packaged deliciousness!  I highly recommend the gummy strawberries and chocolate covered cookie dough!  They have the MOST amazing kettle corn (almost tastes like Pops cereal -- no husks/kernals, super light and golden yellow, fresh beyond comparison)!

My fave newest find are these tiny delicious Italian licorice rounds (kinda of like Sen Sen), called CHIPS.  They're $0.05/piece or you can fill a tiny Chinese takeout container for $3.00.  That's the way to go!

The staff is uber-helpful and friendly. They will gift wrap your goodies for you, or as i did over the holidays (when it was busy and there was a line at the register), they hooked me up with all the fixin's so I could make my own goodie bags & boxes at home.  They gave me scads of ribbon, adorable printed bags & takeout containers, and lots of fun stickers with the Smeeks logo with the shy little gnome.  It was so fun buying a basket full of candy & goodies and making up my gifts at home for a personal touch.

Chili chicken - with gravy, regular (in regards to spice). This is then served over rice/with a side of rice. It's pretty good if you enjoy gravy. 2. Chili chicken dry (meaning no gravy) mild. This is similar in flavor to the ""regular chili chicken"" but crunchy pieces around the edges. They also give you aside of rice, but with it dry you don't really need the rice as much. Both good.

Finally got a chance to check this place out on Sunday before work starts, once I pass through the small door, the place is really big in there, to my surprise that they have a section in the back as a restaurant.
(my first thought of this place is just a small cafe with a few chairs.)

took a quick look at the cookies, pastries and other baked goods, I decided to just have a drink for my first visit.

Nutella Latte caught my eyes and that's a great choice!
For just $3.50 you get the Hazelnut-ty flavor latte that's million times better then what you get at some chain that sells you s**t for $3...

#1: I have eaten here on so many different occasions, both with friends and alone.  The customer service is VERY hit or miss.  It's never consistant.  They are either on track with the food, drinks and are 110% amazing at everything.  Or the food is mis-ordered, glasses sit empty, and one time my plate actually sat behind the counter for 5 minutes only to have another patron ask to take photos of my food (another 5 minutes) before it was served.  

#2:  I love love LOVE the BOGO sushi, I always get the wasabi roll and depending on who's working the sushi bar depends on the amount of wasabi mayo they squirt all over it.  It's easy to scrap off, but come on!  Also, the tuna was alittle disturbing of a color.  I do love their specialty rolls though.

#3:  Great drink specials, and if they make an awful tasting drink (at least to your preference), they have remade for myself and friends, so props to the bartenders.

Menu changed and they took off my favorite burger. No problem, I can just try something else. The burger wasn't bad but here's my issue... 

We ordered a couple of their 'happy hour' drinks. Online they were listed at $3, our waitress told us they were actually $4.50 (which we were ok with), but when the check came they were $5.50. When we inquired with the waitress, she said, 'they must have raised the happy hour prices without telling us.' Honestly, you can't do that to customers. You need to honor the original price you tell them. This felt like a bait-and-switch.

Service was SO SLOW. It took for-ev-er to get the check and then get my credit card back.

Also, I know they're bottomless fries, but they give you a tiny amount to start, and if you ask for more it's at least a 10 minute wait. 

For two average burgers and two drinks, after tip it was $45. That's way too high for a chain. If you're going to charge $14.50 for a burger, it needs to have more than 6 fries on the side and a patty a little larger than the palm of my hand.",2017-02-04 20:09:54

Went with a Burger(forgot the name) medium rare with sweet potato tots, and wifey ordered a French Dip(I think).

I went in to look at a new Veloster about a year ago with little intention of buying that day unless a really good deal popped up.  I got annoyed immediately because a salesman walked in front of my car with his hand out while I was driving so I had to quickly stop to not run him over.  That really bugged me but I let him show me around anyway.

We test drove a car and he filled my head full of lies that I kept shooting down continuously saying, ""I'm not an idiot, I know that's not true.."" and so on.  He finally calmed down with all the BS.  

I told him I loved the car but I also love my current car and wouldn't budge from it without a really good price.  They offered me a great price for my trade in at $19,000.

He started running numbers and I told him they weren't good enough, he went back, brought back more numbers, etc.  Finally we got to a good price.  I asked him how much money I would be financing TOTAL and he gave me a number.  I asked him how it was possible cause it seems really good and he said they really want my car cause it's uncommon and there's all these incentives on the new car n whatever.

I asked him a few more times he was sure that the price on the paper is what I was financing.  He said yes so I shook his hand, rang the bell, signed over my current car, etc.  It was a good time!

I get into the finance room and find out I will be financing about 6,000 more than he showed me.  I got a little bugged.. asked what was going on..  they told me he must have been confused but I should just sign and it's all good.  I was like, ""No, he told me this was the price.. I'm not paying anything else.""  They called him in and he was a complete a-hole and denied it then they sent him out.  I pointed out the paper he had written a number on and they repeated that he must have just gotten confused.  They assured me it was no big deal and it's still a great price and that I should sign.

I told them no thank you and said that I wasn't prepared to spend that kind of money.  They just stared at me and said something about how the deal was already in motion and I wouldn't want to waste the poor salesmen's time.  I said that I was sorry but I want out and I would like my keys back.  They repeated about wasting his time and how messed up that was, something about 2 hours of his day, whatever.  I told them I wanted my keys back,  now.

They had a few people in the room at this point, all standing over me, and informed me that I could not have my keys back because I had signed my car away.  I immediately said, ""OK, well then write me a check for 19,000 dollars.""  They looked extremely confused and said it didn't work that way and that was the trade in price for if I was buying a car.  I told them I wanted a check  for 19k or my keys, immediately.  They refused and tried to get me to buy the car.

After 10 or so minutes of trying to get my car keys back, I snapped and told them I was going to call the police if they didn't give me my keys right now.  I pulled out my phone and started to dial.  The finance guy said ""You're free to get your keys, they are at the front desk.  Just go tell the front you want your keys and they will talk to you.""

I went to the front, jumped half way over their desk, grabbed my keys and left.  

I will never go to a car dealership as a single female again.  Sorry, Henderson Hyundai, but even three men standing over me in a tiny room isn't enough to force me into signing your BS rip-off contract!!  I'm glad I wasted your time!",2013-04-25 23:30:01

Macaroni & Cheese - flavor was good, but could've used a bit more cheese
Pork Osso Buco Confit - fall of the bone pork with so much flavor

They always have specials and it is a great place to spend for holidays (we like going for Mother's Day/Father's Day). They also have 1/2 priced Arizona wines on Sundays, which is a huge perk!

--controlling hostess is stickler for seating rules; _throw down_ to avoid a 30 min wait, or just ask for the manager
--Kyodasan brought with him two chefs, one kitchen, one teppan. great things to come!
--he's already fixed wasabi (no more tubes),
--gari is fresh and tart (not from a jar one month opened) and
--seaweed wraps are dry and crispy, rolls made fresh, not in advance
--fish selection (corporate ""sashimi grade"" blech), and tempura batter will change up first of the year.
--great family place, main dining is loud and boisterous
--benihana ""experience"" feels forced and scripted
--watch out for upsell-freak waiters at your teppan table
--one lunch server is power smoker, taking 3 minute breaks _during service_, then thinking we wouldn't smell his breath. EW.

in the end it's all about the food, and the food is...
--bland, gooey, overcooked, or undercooked.
--teppan fried rice's egg is _always_ burned. how about adding it at the last moment, not starting it first??
--side salad is often not fresh
--miso is colored water, no substance or rich flavor I'm expecting
--ginger and mustard sauces are the same for every main dish

Chef recalls that the last time I visited him at his Shiro (now sadly closed) the county inspector was in the kitchen. What are the odds that on the day I discover his arrival at Benihana, she shows up again?! They'll think I'm some sort of spy. Of course, she arrived right amidst the lunch rush!

I will be heading back in the next few weeks now that I can walk in at will. Yeah! Unlimited art exposure!

Oh, and for those looking to go see Picasso, the exhibit is enhanced by the audio commentary, which you can either pay to listen to OR... you can download as a MP3 (zipped) file which you can hear from a smartphone or a MP3 player. 

You can get these from the AGO site however, it is 21 separate downloads so I am saving you time by getting them all from one ZIP, it is about 16 megs. Cheers!

I noticed the huge cinnamon rolls in the display case today, and I just had to see how it would stack up against Homie's. The true test of an exceptional cinnamon bun is how it tastes from the outside to the center, and omg, this roll was so soft and generously streaked with rich cinnamon all the way through! The vanilla glaze wasn't overly sweet either, and wow-oh-wow, I'll have to ask them if they'll ever make fruity versions, like with apple or raisins. I think the roll only cost about $2, but I can't remember exactly because I felt too giddy after plowing down and finishing it all myself in less than 5 minutes. ^_^  If the display case looks a little bare, it's probably because they haven't brought out everything in the back or they've already sold out of the popular items. Alfredo's patisserie is unique due to the fact that it offers brunch-type items, such as their homemade tamales and authentic croque monsieur or madame sandwiches in addition to the fabulous pastries and bakery stuff.

I was a little disappointed for not having enough noodles. But it was flavorful and had a perfect amount of spice and plenty of leftover meat and veggies after the noodles were gone! 

Thai chicken: when the server brought it out, he poured some liquid over it to make it sizzzzle! Talk about dinner and show! And it came with two dipping sauces, one was a sweet chili sauce and the other had a spicy/fish sauce/lime taste to it. The chicken was juicy and tasty by itself! But the sauces did elevate the flavors and give it that Thai twist! 

Spring rolls: I didn't realize they weren't the fresh kind. It was the fried egg rolls filled with noodles and vegetables. It also came with a delicious dipping sauce that was different from the sweet chili sauce given to us with the chicken. It was my favorite of the three sauces we got!

#1. The Staff. The staff behind the counter are pretty fun and don't hate their job like most other gas stations. They are mostly female, with a mostly male staff running the Car Wash outside. The inside counter girls are always smiling, asking everyone how there day is, and making sure that the needs of the customers are met. Almost flirtatious.

#2. The Car Wash Guys are Awesome. So far searching around for the best Deal, their Highest Wash package (Deluxe?) does regular wash, rinse, wax, under carriage and foam bath for just $11. That also includes a second area, where they scrub down the wheels by hand and hand dry. I always tip the Wheels Guys a little more and they scrub that extra little bit that really makes my tires on my SUV shine! 
If you go early in the morning (7am-9am) I think-they have a special for just $7 for the best wash offered-plus free Vacuums! If you don't mind doing the extra little leg work inside your vehicle-you can definitely say $30 doing it at Terrible's. I usually go a dollar store and pick up basic detailing supplies and just do my own detailing

#3. The sandwich shop inside is manned by a totally delightful sandwich artist named Maribel that has a great smile and is fun to talk to while she makes your sandwich! BONUS- The have a Triple Decker Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich for just $1.50! Get outttta HERE!

All in all, I really like the service and attention to detail at this location, and though I don't know any of them as a regular, I always enjoy coming in here and think whoever is managing that location is doing a great job with their staff.

Parking was a breeze and so was entry into the park.  The usher took us to our seats where some other locals were sitting.  They apologized and got up and moved with no drama.  That kind chill factor made for a nice environment where everyone seemed at ease and not looking to start anything.  The food cost was as I would imagine just as expensive at any other ball park.  I preferred to just drink the Kona Longboard lagers I was happy to see they served.  In walking around and looking around I could see that there was not a bad seat in the house.  A pleasant night out the ball park indeed.,2012-07-10 05:17:35

We randomly decided to try this place out one afternoon. This place is the definition of a gastropub - there's a nice bar atmosphere, but the food is more than your usual burger and fries.

All of their small tapas dishes are worth a try, the quail is especially nice. For main dish, I got the Amish chicken and waffles and thought it was delicious. During the week, they have specials every night (not uncommon in the Cleveland area) and they have a nice selection on tap.

The only downside I can think of is that the price is comparable to more of a nicer place versus a bar.

We came to Hakkasan during Restaurant Week 2018. We each had the $50 prix fixe menu with an additional appetizer apiece.  We also began with a bourbon (big pour) and a Japanese Old Fashioned (more fruity than boozy, but very strong and tasty).  

For our meal we began with the hot and sour soup and the duck and foie gras in sesame wrap.  The hot and sour soup was just a very high scale, great rendition, but nothing surprising.  The sesame roll was fantastic.  Soft skin, crispy duck, and though only a tiny spread of foie gras, oh so delectable - a must try appetizer.

For our dinner we had the vegetarian and the Hakka dim sum platters.  Each was presented in a very instagramy way and each was prepared to perfection in a soft, thin wrap, with tons of meat inside.  The veggie platter had a fake duck and chicken that tasted like the real thing, while the Hakka, focusing more on seafood, was fresh and thick and crunchy.  Perfect opening dish.  For the entree, we had the szechuan sea bass and the rib eye.  Sea bass was the real deal.  Easy to cut and a real Chinese, upscale dish.  The rib eye, as expected, was cooked to a chewy goodness, in a very dippable merlot sauce.  The rib eye did come with some unappetizing fried noodle, but given that the fried rice accompanying the meal is fresh as you can get, I didn't worry too much.  They also had a chili dipping sauce from the dumpling that was so good and gave just enough kick, that we even kept it to use during our entrees.  The carrot cake was unexpectedly good.  A Chinese restaurant offering carrot cake was interesting to say the least, but their rendition with a coconut ice cream on the side was very good and a nice palate cleanser to end the meal.  

Restaurant Week strikes again and Hakkasan did not disappoint.  For $50, we would have definitely felt satisfied.  Adding on a few appetizers and drinks, we were stuffed.  My only complaint was that the dessert, the carrot cake, could not be substituted, although we both got Restaurant Week menus.  In the future, I think they should be able to substitute to let the entire table try other dishes if you all order the fixed menu.  The place gets quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so even with a reservation we had to wait another 15 minutes at the bar.  But other than that, fantastic meal all around.",2018-06-23 19:03:32

For the most part, staff felt friendly on the surface, but I kept feeling hovered over, which took away from the cozy ambience and nice selection of wine.

Went for dinner.  Everything was good, except they currently really don't have a dinner menu other than what they have on special.  Server informed us they are still doing a 'soft opening'.   Our group had the zucchini strips for an appetizer and then the shaved french dip, chicken sandwich and the shrimp rolls.  Sandwiches served with fries or power slaw (which I'm assuming is cole slaw). 
My only problem with the shrimp rolls was that while it is supposed to be on a grilled butter bun, it seemed more like 2 slices of bread folded in half.  And the one was falling apart with the shrimp falling through.  Also had a chocolate covered strawberry martini which was very good but a bit pricey at $9.95.

The fries are the ruffled ones (too soggy) and the Texas toast isn't good at all (soggy as well and needs garlic or something to make it taste better). All in all the chicken is pretty solid.

The shrimp dumplings were massive.  The skin broke apart fairly easily but man, the shrimp were abundant.   

Shrimp rice rolls also had a similar problem, the rice roll was too soft (overcooked?) and fell apart much too easily.  The shrimp were large and of good quality.  

Other dishes:  siu mai were pretty good, tripe was average, the sticky rice was very good with lots of filling, BBQ rice roll was average, the dough fritter rice roll was alright too...  BBQ pork and pine nut pockets were very good. I think that was all.

Nice fine dining environment. Service was attentive, water and tea filled frequently.  The downside was the servers who brought the food weren't very careful when placing the dishes on the table.  Sauces spilled, but good thing it wasn't on anyone.  

It was very good overall, and I would go back.  However, I think we are feeling the aftermath of MSG...  I may edit this later...",2014-05-05 01:02:02

for me I like to go on a week day early
they have your usual breakfasts eggs bacon toast 
they also have Benedicts I have had their avocado veggie version and its so good!
then there are their pancakes
season featured my favorite pumpkin which comes in a few varieties even one with ice cream
its all so good
and their fish sammie a big piece of perfecty fried cod...that thing is huge on a nice fresh roll even their tartar sauce is good nice n creamy 
lots other sammie choices and burgers
they have shakes and sodas
their ice tea is surprisingly good I always have it

I decided to meet up with my boyfriend midweek day for something casual, and we didn't feel like going far from my work so I chose Milestone's. There are two levels to this restaurant and as soon as you walk in, you are given the choice to eat upstairs or at the bar (main level). We chose a booth by the bar and ordered beer and wine galore. 

We started with 2 orders of the burger sliders (yum!) and sweet potato fries. I need to mention that the sliders, although ordinary in its conception and probably relatively easy to cook, was delicious. We loved them so much that we ordered another plate of sliders and fries (very healthy) and just chatted the afternoon away. 

This is a relatively short review as we came to Milestone's for neither a lunch or dinner, but rather for snacks and drinks. And for that, I think Milestone's satisfied the both of us. Service was actually good in the sense that we were left to talk and laugh to our hearts content (no rushing us out) and with the occasional checkup. This was what we wanted; service that was there but not intrusive. In my opinion, as good as it gets in the immediate Yonge and Sheppard area for big-chainy food.",2011-12-13 16:13:54

My fiance and I came out on a warm Friday evening around 7:45 and there was no wait to be seated. We even asked to sit outside and there were plenty of options. The crowd on a Friday night was older and more relaxed than I would've expected, but it was relaxed and quiet, so I'm not complaining. 

To drink, I ordered a gin-based cocktail with light citrus-y flavors (I forget the name unfortunately) but it was very refreshing and well-made. 

To eat, my fiance and I started with the waffled corn bread with pimento cheese & pepper jelly. This is some of the best pimento I've ever had and it pairs super well with the cornbread and jelly. Highly recommend.

I then balanced out my meal with a very healthy Great Big salad. This is also one of the best salads I've ever had simply due to the variety of toppings that you don't normally see. It was a bed of mixed greens with beets, green beans, goat cheese, garbanzo beans, and sunflower seeds. I ordered the large (meal-sized) with their lemon vinaigrette, which was a great decision!

Let's start off with the $5 shrimp wonton egg noodles. You'll be hard pressed to find that good of a deal anywhere. It comes with three (was I cheated one?) large wontons and the shrimp is nice and tender. I personally liked the fish balls better though. They were also fairly large and tasty. There's a good amount of noodles (and soup) included and should be filling enough for meal.

The dried noodles (lo mein) included a bowl of soup which is awesome. Get the plate of veggies (gai lan) for $2.50 and thank me later. You need your veggies, and they're good for you! :) They're boiled and served with oyster sauce. Compliments the noodle soups very well. 

Overall I found everything a tad too salty but that's just my taste buds. The chili oil is on the spicier side of chili oils so use and eat with caution, because my lips were on fire and made the hot broth even worse. 

When I first stepped in, I certainly did not expect the place to look as it is. Full of tables, walls covered with articles, it just looked very messy.

The short ribs on the other hand was great. The meat just fell right off the bones. I feel like some of the short ribs can have less fat or could of been cooked a little longer.

I went with a friend and we both got the combo where you can pick two items out of a soup, salad, and sandwich for around $8. You order up front (got that Subway feel; you can see the workers whip up the food in front of you) and the workers are incredibly friendly! It took literally less than a minute to get our order. 

I got the Crab Avocado Melt and the Kale Quinoa Salad. The salad was tossed in a sweeter dressing with chopped kale, quinoa, pistachios, fresh blueberries, tomatoes, dried raspberries, and grated Parmesan on top. SO delicious and quite a large portion! The sandwich was deliciously cheesy and had crab salad, avocado and bacon in it. You also get a small baguette and a chocolate covered strawberry (nice touch) with the combo.

It was a great, filling lunch and less than $20 for two people. I'll definitely be back!",2015-04-19 19:08:36

My friend and I split a duck poutine pizza. We had heard a lot of hype about this pizza and were excited to try it. 

Unfortunately, the pizza didn't excite us at all. It took nearly 30 minutes for one pizza and once we received it and started to eat it, we realized the bottom was completely burnt. The server, who was kind and quick to respond offered to replace the pizza but this took nearly another 20 minutes.

This is probably a one off but from now on I'm going to stick to the coffee and pastries.",2017-02-01 21:51:21

I was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about 7:15 on a Friday night.  They said 30 min wait for a party of 5. Not too bad.  After watching 3 groups who came in after us be seated first (and yes, one was a party of 5) we approached the hostess stand to check on things.  Suddenly we were ""next"".

Server was Justin.  He said his hellos, told us about the specials, took our drink orders. We'd planned to try a few appetizers, but at that point we were all hungry enough we wanted to go right for the main course. Then we were brought the chips and salsa.  I inquired about the 3 salsas.  He said, this one is hot, this one is pico de gallo, and this is our pineapple salsa.  The chips weren't just ""got out of a bag"" chips, they were no-name, not very good, wouldn't serve them to my friends chips.  But, we nibbled on them anyhow because we wanted to try the salsas.  I went right for the hot.  Hot?  It was barely warm.  It was very ""tomato"" tasting, with one person commenting that it almost had spagetti sauce taste.  How can you be going for a Latin flavor and not be packing any heat??  I try the ""Pico de gallo"".  It's chunky salsa.  But whatever.  It had that fresh taste that many salsas have fresh out of the bottle.  My last hopes were the pineapple salsa.  It was different, and in the end the one I actually liked the most because at least they were trying to be creative.

Can you believe I'm not to the main courses yet?  Justin sets them down quickly and makes his escape.  Visually - they were quite good.  2 of our folks got tortas - one beef and one chicken.  They were ""fine"".  Both tortas and the burgers come with fries and the fruit slaw on the side. No one liked the slaw.(Friend said it was more straw than slaw)  To me, it was ok - but not worthy of the large portion it took on the plate.  Would have been MUCH better to just fill the plate with the waffle fries that were actually pretty good.  One person got shrimp enchiladas.  That was pretty good - but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town.  I got the pork loin chops.  Honestly - with this being one at their highest price point, I figured I should really get to see their strength here.  It was pretty.  The two thin chops were cooked fine - but it wasn't cooked IN anything for extra flavor, which pork really needs.  It touted an ""herby garlic, cilantro, lime sauce"".  It was green, and not bad, but with those things you would have thought it might have had more kick.  Or at least flavor. It wasn't bad in a way that detracted from the meal, but it didn't add much.  The green beans were at that same ""fine"" point.  They were very green and looked great.  But beyond the almonds someone threw on top (again, not cooked with at all, just threw on top at the last minute) there wasn't much flavor.  ( I buy the big frozen bag from Trader Joe's, steam them, toss w/ a pat of butter, salt and pepper and they could kick the butt of these green beans. I didn't have that high of a bar, but they didn't even meet it.)

The night was capped with some poor service mistakes.  Several of us had discussed trying a desert.  Instead of a request for desert, we got a check.  We figured it was a sign.  We were dividing the check into 2.  A friend who had been a server suggested that we mark the items that went on a particular card and then it was easiest for them to split the check.  We were explaining that to Justin as he was seemingly running from the table. (Did we have ebola and no one told us?)  When he accidentally put the wrong total on each card, and we asked him to switch the totals, rather than go do it, he was argumentative at the table for several minutes about how he did it right and kept trying to push fault to the friend who handed him the bill. he then stormed from the table (like a 2 yr old) saying as he went, ""Fine, I'll just have to go switch them"".  Yea, that's all we'd been going for.  The whole table felt uncomfortable and insulted.  A friend noticed we were ""dropped off"" to go boxes when all other tables had their food taken away and the server put them in the boxes.  I don't know if we just had an awful server or if he thought we'd be bad tippers (I've never gone under 20% for good service - bad never gets less then 15%) but it will be a long time before any of us go there again. The atmosphere was cute, but the food was not a good value and never really rose above ""Ok"".",2007-03-31 20:13:03

I guess the quote ""you get what you pay for"" is accurate because although the tickets are pricey {$14 per person!}, the reclining seats are extremely nice! I LOVE being able to put my feet up in a movie theater! It was so comfortable. Definitely be sure to book your tickets ahead of time if you are seeing a popular/new movie because since the seats are larger, the theaters accommodate less people so they sell out much quicker. It is nice that you can pick your seats ahead of time so that you don't have to walk into the theater until RIGHT when it starts.

r8zSvJpZH45YLTTaqhKqPw,EC5TGpxONfz4IZIjML0DpQ,qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA,3,2,0,0,"I have mixed feelings about this place as I have had many a fun time at the Red Room. However most of those times fall under a very specific set of guidelines. 

First, stick to the patio. Second, do not order a real meal, because the dishes can be low-rent in both flavour and well, actually flavour is the most important thing! As such, I generally kept my orders to only their sandwiches, such as the Avocado and Brie or their Cheese sandwiches or just beer. They are both cheap and good. Avoid any dish that comes with a salads (they are really bad) or their pastas and their coffee.  It also helps if you come with a friend or two! I can only imagine, coming to this place by yourself is probably the definition of dreadful. 

Remember, like its sister locations, The Green Room and Nirvana, The Red Room is the very definition of  a 'dive bar.' You go there fully expecting that and if anyone comesexpecting something different, then they are not seeing the place for what it is. Like expecting burgers and fries at a Chinese restaurant.  

There is a certain personality and age group that will find the Red Room very appealing however, many will not... So to generalize, if you are on a student budget, or an actual student, under say, 28 and/or the proverbial 'Queen street type,' then chances are that you will like the joint.  

The inside of the Red Room during the day feels like a cave and sometimes it smells like one... although in fairness, I do like the Bohemian feel of this joint, with bookshelves here, a piano there, the retro booths, the somewhat messy look is interesting to me. Although like the Green Room this place looks much better by candlelight than by sunlight. So time any visits accordingly. 

Oh, and since some Yelps have brought this up, personally when I have been there, the bathrooms smelled just like bathrooms.  

Do not expect the best/fastest service unless you are at the patio, which normally seems to get the most attention.  So basically if you set your expectations to ""Dive Bar,"" then you will have a good time. If you are expecting something more then just avoid this place.",2011-10-14 17:14:57

Ok wait not really....then I would have had the 15 cent sammiches. No I had the 8-12 dollar sandwiches....Yea so I'm not that old. BUT STILL. TI made this place a neo retro future version of Canter's with old pictures of the LA Canter's like it burned down. Yes instead of walking into the smells of fresh bread and pastries....walk in to the sounds of people chittering over scripts and synagogues. You brush through the smells of smoke and air conditioning with the sounds of slot machines and drunkeness....to NEO SPACIAN CANTER'S
Sure the menu is slightly the same.....I do happen to remember a plethora of items on the menu at Canter's LA. 

""But Jefe....do you even know what a plethora is?""

Yea I did miss my Pastrami with COLESLAW IN THE SANDWICH! or my Corned beef. WITH COLESLAW IN THE SANDWICH! The pickles were alright. They didn't seem pickled enough. I asked the people there and they said it's all the same stuff from LA. They did have these chocolate pastry things. I forget what they're called. Some Jewish something of somesort.

The matzo ball soup. Still better than the deli at Caesar's. Yea so it's cute, they give you a plastic pickle number so Canter's people bring you your food. Wait doesn't carl's jr do that? Yea I just don't think that's cool. Bring me a waiter or waitress that has stories from the golden age of Hollywood and LA. Overall. The romance and beauty of Canter's LA isn't there. It's been replaced by a spaceship replica of Lost in Space.

Definitely not your typical family owned brunch restaurant that caters to retirees. Moderate sized patio as well. Noise level is high but goes well with the bustling brunch atmosphere. Patrons are all ages with lots of families.

Food:  Their unique offering is the German pancake which is a must try (probably best to split between two as they're HUGH). The subtle sweetness of the batter mixes well with the butter and sour lemon twist. You can add fruit for extra but it's not necessary. The have an extensive breakfast menu which should satisfy most. The eggs Benedict with avocado was ok, nothing to write home about. 

Service: There's usually a 10-20 minute wait on weekends. Both times we went we were waited on by Ethan, who you can tell really cares to take care of his customers even in the mist of how crazy busy this place is.

Unique look when you walk in. Large dance floor, band set up at the end of the room & tables around the dance floor. No band when we were there, but we were told they do ballroom dancing, Salsa, Tango & have instructors available. Sounds Fun!!!

Luba is the owner & she came over to go thru the menu with us. We ordered some home-made Sangria and  a reasonably priced red wine which she recommended.  Both were very good & easy to recommend. 

Luba went thru the starters menu & she was really generous with her time and gave us some great information about each starter. We ordered so many starters that we decided to just do that first & see if we were full after eating those. 

We started with the flaming piggy dish in the pic. The Portuguese Chorizo sausage which was being seared by the flame was crisp & flavorful, with a home-made sauce which was very acidic and interesting. We all shared it & everyone liked it. 

Next came the snails in cheese.  Such large snails drenched in a wonderful white cheese sauce. We had a good fight over this fish. Soooo good!

Octopus... We stretched our minds & tried this at Luba's urging.  It was very, very tasty. It disappeared quickly. 

Toasted Goat cheese.  Wow Wow Wow. I can still taste it & it make me want to go back soon. 

We did not love the kale soup... Luba said a lot of people do.  Kale is an acquired taste for sure.  It is a little bland in my opinion. Tastes healthy.

Gargantuan Oyster... Mild, sweet and SO FRESH! You will have to cut some of them into pieces. Not kidding! These oysters are HUGE! 

Deserts. We tried the chocolate cake... Really good. It disappeared.  Baclava with ice cream. We ordered extra ice cream & enjoyed it with both dishes & alone.

However the food did meet my expectations. I ordered the deluxe version of their pho. The deluxe version added meatballs, flank steak, beef brisket and tendons in additional to the sliced beef eye round, noodles and greens that you'd get with their regular pho. 

The food came out very quickly and the server was pleasant. The pho was served with a side of bean sprouts, sliced lime, jalapeños, and basil. Sriracha and hoisin sauces were also brought out. 

The broth itself was not bad. It had a more airy taste than the broths at other pho shops. The broth tasted more herby. Perhaps its my acquired taste towards other pho broths, I didn't find this as good. The meats in the broth were too well done despite opting for the rare version of the sliced beef eye. Although it came with a variety of meats, I feel for $9.95, the quantity of each variety can be more. The noodles itself isn't too different, although it did seem thinner and slipperier. After finishing the noodles and meat, I left the broth to settle. Usually I would see the broth become ""cloudy"", but this wasn't the case with this broth. This indicates that the broth wasn't made with enough bone marrow or wasn't cooked long enough for the proteins to separate from the bones. 

All in all, this is a good place to grab lunch, especially this is the only place in the east suburbs that serves pho.",2013-06-06 17:22:39

We've been waiting on this location to open for quite some time and the wait was well worth it! 

Food: It's pretty simple! You get to choose a hummus flavor as a base, then select your greens that they have available, do rice or beans or half and half, then choose a protein and load on the topping options! Since we do about 80% plant based eating, we were in the right spot! I chose the plain hummus, kale greens, half beans and half rice, and falafel for my protein. On top I did cucumbers, their quinoa mixture, beets, fennel slaw, tahini sauce, garlic spread and chickpeas! The serving size was huge and the flavors were perfect! 

Service: the staff was helpful and friendly. For our first time, they answered all of my questions even if the answers were right in front of me lol.

Atmosphere: Hummus is big enough for a larger party or for a couple of people to enjoy their time together. It's not too big or too small. There's even outdoor seating tables which we loved to let our little one eat (messily) and run amuck afterwards.

I originally visited Brew Tea Bar because I saw some pictures from Michael K and Antonia R of sea salt tea. Sea salt tea? SEA SALT TEA? I haven't had a good one since SoCal! So I MUST go and try this place! 

I decided to try their Oolong Latte, which is their oolong tea with sea salt cream. Their oolong had immense flavor yet not bitter. It was brewed just perfectly. What's great is that it is not diabetes in a cup! It had just the right amount of sweetness to it. However, I think they did put a little bit too much cream in it so once I mixed the whole drink together, the cream covered a lot of the oolong taste. Another good thing though? If you don't like your drink, they can re-make it for you for free. But no, I didn't have them remake it. It's unnecessary. Next time, I will just request less cream in the drink or just don't mix it at all haha!

Then last night, I brought some friends with me to try the place. 

We have also had the pleasure of meeting Sous. He knows his stuff and is able to recommend something based on your preferences/wants/desires. He is very knowledgeable about his products as well. He was the one that recommended the roobios for me since I didn't want something heavy since we had just filled up on dinner. It was also good for digestion! 

With the five of us all together, we got a hokkaido milk tea, 'the brew' milk tea, jasmine milk tea, jasmine latte (sea salt), and a freshly brewed roobios tea. 

The hokkaido milk tea is sweet and has a very distinct aroma and taste to it. It has a very milky taste. It's probably not my cup of tea since it is based off of a creamy candy so it can potentially be very sweet. But it is VERY good despite that.

'The Brew' milk tea is amazing. It is their standard, almost ""regular"" milk tea and it is made with high quality. You can definitely taste the tea in their milk tea. The milk and sugar absolutely does not mask it, which is what I love. A majority of milk tea places in Vegas make that mistake far too often -- by giving you a little bit a tea with a lot of milk and sugar. Either that or it's really watered down. Sure it saves on the costs but it certainly doesn't have my loyalty. 

The jasmine milk tea is phenomenal. I have been looking for quite some time for an establishment to make jasmine milk tea the correct way -- well, to my taste buds anyways. Ladies and gentlemen, I have found it. I'm not even sure how to describe it. It is THE place to get jasmine milk tea. 

The jasmine latte is also very good. Just as the jasmine milk tea, the aroma is what wins everyone over. However, you probably shouldn't mix everything all together in the beginning so it doesn't get too milky. 

The roobios tea. An african tea that gives you the feeling that you're drinking grass jelly with a hint of herbalness at the end. With a tad bit of honey, it is perfect to end the night with. Plus, great for digestion! 

Brew Tea Bar, in my opinion, would be the #1 spot for any tea related cravings. It is possibly the best place in Vegas to grab some milk teas. The quality that you get is just simply fantastic. Once you walk in, you can see the jars of tea leaves right behind the cashiers. I simply cannot wait to return to try more of their tea based drinks. I'm also waiting for them to have sea salt coffee on the menu :) I am just so happy that I have found a place that I can honestly say that their milk tea is deliciously yummy. AND it's right next to zee boyfriends house SO WIN WIN! 

If you like milk tea then you have got to try Brew Tea Bar. Oh they also have a stamp card :) Buy 10, get 1 so don't forget it!

It was the perfect afternoon for dining al fresco. My dining companion had been there before so she knew what she wanted right away. I had a hard time deciding between breakfast and lunch (they serve breakfast until 2:30). Everything on the menu is organic, and they have gluten free options as well. All I knew was that whatever I chose for an entree, I had to get the sweet potato tots on the side. My co-Yelpers . . . you are so right! The tots arrived fresh and hot . . . I was so excited to try one, I burnt my mouth on the first. OMG, they were so divine . . . sweet, crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside. You could easily order these for dessert!

For an entree I had the veggie omelet. I didn't even have to tell them I liked my omelet on the light side, not overcooked. It was splendid! I also loved the fact they the didn't butter my rye toast! 

My girlfriend ordered the summer rolls which she loved, and the hummus. The hummus came with a huge plate of pita, not the typical little serving you get at some restaurants. I tentatively tasted the cilantro hummus (I sometimes like cilantro and sometimes don't), and I was pleasantly surprised at how the flavors worked so well together. Who would have thunK? 

As I watched other orders being delivered to tables, I couldn't help but notice the gigantic hamburger and the huge salads. I will definitely be suggesting Tryst as a regular meeting place for lunch, as there are so many items on the menu I still want to try.

No blueberry glazed, no cream filled, no strawberry glazed.

Two of three experiences were great. The third was not as fantastic, mainly due to service. A comedy of errors starting with a mix up on the beer delivered and being told whoops! Oh well. To being asked if we were ok not having bread with the charcuterie board because they ran out (as it turns out they got some in from their friends down the street at bar Isabella). Then when asking if we could have another slice of bread (4 people - 3 slices of bread) the answer was - you can purchase some for $4. 

Then the kicker was waiting almost 2 hours to be served our mains without a word from our waiter. When he finally did serve us no apology. We are a relatively easy going bunch but honestly really confused by the lack of ownership and service.

To Kofusion's credit, it's the only venue in this rural Midwest town that attempts the urban dance-club sushi experience. Against that backdrop, it really is filling a unique niche. East Coast + West Coast elitist diners will likely be unimpressed (if you're ensnared here for years due to work or school, the nostalgia/desperation for big city experiences might change your mind).

Arguably, if you're eating at an Asian fusion restaurant, you should have no expectations of ""authenticity"" in regards to the food. The drink selection features fruity cocktails with sexy, ""exotic"" names and $9+ price tags. Many items on the menu are outright American cuisine lacking even a hint of ""fusing"" with Asian elements. In that respect, this place is ideal for groups made up of both adventurous diners and those who fear ""fish breath.""

The biggest draw for Kofusion are the Sunday and Monday $1 sushi specials. Folks with raw food aversions need not worry. All of the $1 sushi options are variations of deep-fried meats, cream cheese filling, and mayonnaise/sugary sauces. There's such a demand on these nights that the preparation definitely cuts corners--but if you're filling up on these bite-sized heart-attacks, you're likely channeling your inner fat kid and won't mind the rushed presentation.

For people who love Japanese cuisine for its delicate, clean flavors, the sushi bar also serves more ""traditional"" fare, though I've sometimes received pieces of sashimi sliced rather clumsily.

My advice: the $1 price tag for the Sunday/Monday specials requires such little investment that it's worth a shot for new diners. It might even be the best opportunity for initiating people who are normally turned off by the idea of sushi.",2013-04-19 16:33:10

I was greeted immediately by the barista when I walked in. The place is very big, spacious, and clean. It looked like a good place to have lunch, study, meet friends or go on a date with. You can definitely people watch on the bar stools that face the window. The barista was great at helping me decide on what to get. I wanted something with espresso in it and he recommended the chai latte with a shot of espresso - he called it the chaipresso (clever). Side note: The name of the coffee shop is also very clever in my opinion! He showed me the chai he used and poured the drink in front of me. He was very approachable and made my experience at this new tea shop a good one.

The price of the chaipresso was around $8 for a large. It's on par with other gourmet tea/coffee places, but just a tad more expensive than what I am used to paying for. The chaipresso is very flavorful - I taste the spice (possible cardamom and nutmeg) and cinnamon flavour quite well and it's not too sweet. In fact, it reminds me an indian chai, which is delicious. I feel this tea could definitely help with a sore throat due to the spices in it! Another thing I love is that it does not leave a tea after taste. It's more of a nice cardamom nutmeg flavour.  

I would definitely come back and try their other teas when I feel like treating myself during work! They accept credit cards.",2016-11-02 18:52:00

They are now over here, which makes this marketplace of 4 businesses where everyone soon goes broke worthy because of Gushi and The Jerk Joint!

Gushi, which is a play on words for 'kushi' which is Japanese for skewers, is actually named after the owner. The emphasis here is on 'Japanese street food' but which street in Japan has these food items? Seriously? OK, if you mean cheap Japanese fast food sold in certain stores or restaurants then that's another thing.
I had nanban, which is southern style karage (chicken nuggets), purple rice, citrus juice and Japanese style mayonnaise and the chicken was juicy, the sauce was heavy and I am still unimpressed with Japanese purple rice. The caramalized onions were tasty.
They come in 2 sizes and the 'regular' is filling enough. It is $10.
They serve other Japanese food items too, but their bread and butter is their chicken of course.

Gushi is essentially a small kiosk with no seating available. There are several standing only tables in the rundown and dirty corridor. 

What makes them lose a point and go down to 3/5 from 4/5 is the demand for tips. The machine prompts you to tip 15, 20 or 25%!! 

1- There is no tipping in Japan. That is the civilized way. The price is the price. Good service brings the customer back and buys loyalty.
2- There is no service. This is a take-out counter. Why does one need to tip? Also, do I need to tip at McDonalds too? How about the Post Office? What about at the supermarket? If no, why would I tip here? Pay your employees enough and if you need to raise your prices and I can budget accordingly and decide to buy or not! Thankfully the government of Ontario has already legislated an increase in minimum wage to $15 beginning next year.
With that said, I object to tipping as a concept even where there is waiter service. The price is false advertising then otherwise.
3- What is with the options being up to 25%? Why not just add 200%?
The lame silliness has to stop. We already have had the government legislate to force businesses like airlines, travel agencies, car dealers, etc. have to by force of law advertise actual pricing. I hope restaurants are next.
I of course chose 'amount' and picked 0.

By the way, the word 'nanban' means 'south' in Japanese.",2017-07-02 03:39:11

The beer was straight - bud lite and miller lite draft from a piTCHer - no complaints here.   The wings were surprisingly good for a new establishment.  The sauce, a simple HOT sauce, was tasty, but it was the sweet, not the heat that made this sauce.  I def recommend the wings if you are looking for something to try.  I am anxious to return to sample other items on the menu.

The service was excellent.  Not only was the wait staff easy on the eyes, but they were friendly, professional and quick to refill anyone that needed beer or water.  

The interior is cool.  I like that they have plenty of screens hanging throughout the bar.  I also like that they have a long bar, with plenty of seating. 

Overall, I must say AAP has peaked my interest.  So far they are off to a good start with a solid mix of food, service & ambiance.  This is a place I would def like to try again, and a place I might consider when looking for a sports bar in the area.",2012-07-06 06:36:41

In reading some of the previous reviews, I've noticed a heap of scorn being hurled at the service. In all honesty, we had zero issues with the hospitality. Our waiter, whose name escapes me, was friendly and adept. PG&SB was surprisingly barren on a Friday evening, something that put the young, tattooed, light-footed garcon at ease. I'm sure he deserved an easy night for a change. ""It's been crazy lately with the big rubber duck and the Pirates. Whew. I'm glad it's a little slow,"" He said. 

Regarding cleanliness, the restaurant was immaculate from what I could tell. I noticed no foul smells, dirty tables, dingy silverware, or spotty glasses. 

Why am I only giving them a 3 out of 5? For starters, I should say that my 3 will be a very high 3, but that rating falls short of a 4 (which is what I wish I could give them) due to a dinner that teetered between the markers of ""Bravo!"" and ""Blah"" too often.

Once again, I came very close to ordering a burger as I do much too often in restaurants such as these, but deciding to halt that compulsion in its tracks, I rolled the bones and went with a Pittsburgh Steak Sandwich. The shaved ribeye, grilled peppers and onions, and a wad of melted provolone in a mushy, perfect Portugeuse-ish submarine roll was as enjoyable a Philly ""wit"" as any I could possibly devour in Steeltown. The meat was generous, the cheese was oozy, the vegetables were properly caramelized, stooping sidewalk pleasures were had. I almost wanted to stand up and eat it over a counter. 

Those accompanying french fries, however, were quite obviously frozen, something that need not have been. And no, they were not in the sandwich, nor was coleslaw present.  Are ya kiddin' me? Cut up some taters, and twice-fry 'em, guys!  If I can do it...hell, if teenagers working at Kennywood for the summer can...

Redundancy be damned, Kay and I shared some pierogi for an appetizer. Plump and delicate, they invoked gently boiled ravioli or gnocchi with their garlic butter, sauteed peppers and onions, and Parmesan. Only some marinara sauce was missing, but we made do with that which never fails to tempt tongues and soothe heat: sour cream. Again, writing candidly (as always, despite what my detractors say), PG&SB's pierogi were outstanding and rank among the very best I've ever feasted (beasted?) on. 

The Homemade Brownie a la Mode, another obsession of mine, was our shared dessert by default, and wasn't much more than what its title indicates. There were blobs of vanilla ice cream and ribbons of hot fudge involved. It seemed thrown together. The plating was unimaginative, and the brownie itself lacked the fudgy, just-baked oomph I anticipate when I order such a thing. I've heard better renditions of this song, and they've been many. 

Damn. Here I am, still weighing my grade. 

Look, omitting dessert and those factory fries, PG&SB would garner a 4 from my keystrokes without any nail-biting , but with a run-of-the-mill menu of bar food at hand, this place needs everything to be stellar, and our meal didn't reach enough of those gastronomic highs for me (see Sidelines in Millvale for what typical pub munchies can and should be).  In other words, FRESH fries and brownies that murder with decadence need to happen here. Homemade ice cream and hot fudge wouldn't hurt either. Those pierogi and that cheesesteak can most certainly stay.",2013-10-13 18:30:51

My lover and I stuck with old reliables: taro milk tea with boba and a black tea. After choking down powder on my first sip I shook and stirred my taro milk tea for a good two minutes to get it were it should have been. At least the boba was good, but looking at reviews that doesn't always seem to be the case. The black tea was WAY TOO SWEET. I've heard that they make things too sweet, but this was bad.

Went to have lunch last Saturday and BOY what a waste of time and money. I've been coming here for years and I know that it is a hit or miss most of the time. It was packed, which is fine, they were setting up for large parties, but we were severely neglected (even though we were one of like 7 tables seated). Our server looked like she was having the WORST day of her life, and I don't resent her for it, who know what's what. 

We ordered Bloody Marys, which were basically shrimp cocktail sauce in a glass. I get using some horseradish in the mix, but the consistency and the flavor intensity was just straight up cocktail sauce. So disappointing because my man and I came a little hungover and were really looking forward to it. My pet peeve in restaurants is when stuff is sent out without anyone checking the food or doing a drink taste test. UGH!!! 

I had a french onion soup. It came with a large crouton with cheese on top of it. It was extremely inconvenient to eat, I was struggling with that big chunk of bread, glued to the cheese for a while. Tasty though. I'd really recommend dropping a piece of toasted bread in the soup and baking the cheese over the bowl, it's what French Onion Soup is ALL about, the cheese factor! I mean Google the thing for F sake and you will see many amazing ways of presenting this awesome dish! 

The bf had a blue cheese burger. He eats red meat like once in a year and was looking forward to it. Medium rare.... came out well done, extra dry and there was a very conservative drop of blue cheese on there. Meh. 

I had a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. First bite was like biting into smelly fish. The turkey was completely spoiled. I thought it was just me (because of the night before), the bf did a taste test and we sent it back. There was no significant reaction from the server, like AT ALL. And 20 min later she comes by and says ""I'll take that off the bill for ya okaaay?"" Like she was doing us a favor. We both looked at her and said ""uhh... yeah, you will!"" 

We noticed other patrons sending food back and the owner did absolutely nothing about coming over and talking to the guests or making apologies. Every time I see him, he just strikes me as a huge huge douche. And knowing this place (and many people who have worked here) he is and so is his wife. No wonder there is no enthusiasm in this place and why their employee turnover is so high. Shame.

Do yourself a favor, skip lunch and have a dinner here. Service will always be total sh*t, but it's great atmosphere for you and your love and if you stick to perhaps the cheese plate, the muscles and other simpler items, you will not be disappointed.",2014-06-05 04:27:44

I'm a sucker for a good ol' dive bar, or in this case...casino.  Two years ago my friends and I wandered into this area of Fremont, and decided to stop in the El Cortez.

Here's my theory when it comes to gambling... it's all computer based!!!! You can rub the machine, take your pay out ticket in & out, do whatever it is ""thinking"" you'll WIN...but it's all based on what the computer is doing, and well luck too, I suppose...  
My theory continues...
I kept reading how this is a big pay out casino, I mean...how could that be??? One more so than another??? Is it possible??? Well, doesn't hurt to find out.  
When I visited a few years back...my friend played an older slot machine and doubled his money.  I believe it was quarters, and he paid for our cab back to the strip.  I didn't play, I helped him gamble.  I didn't do much gambling this past trip since I was only in Vegas less than 24 hours but I played here, based on my reading, research, and last experience, and ... doubled my money playing slots.  My friend hit $100 on the green machine slot game too.

First off, selections are vegan-friendly, veggie-friendly, and meat-person friendly, because they have chicken and BACON available. However, vegan options here are just as delicious as non-vegan items. 

On my first trip I had the WHAT WHAT sandwich - sliced roasted turkey, pepperoni (a surprisingly tasty addition!), mixed greens, tomatoes, red onion, basil aioli, and a lemon vinaigrette, all placed into a wonderfully soft ciabatta bread. Comes with a side of greens lightly doused in vinaigrette. This sandwich was so good, so so so good. Fresh, filling, and not overly indulgent. 

Second lunch break (the day after the first) I returned and decided to just go with a smoothie, so I picked the Vegan Raw Cacao Superfoods Blended - this comes with almond mylk, banana, avocado, dates, maca powder, and cacao powder. Now, I was comparing this to a smoothie I had recently at Greens & Proteins, however, there was definitely a subtle difference in this one, which I think was definitely coming from the dates - which is an amazing addition! I would have never thought to add dates to my own homemade smoothies. So, this is something I will have to try out myself!

That is a great thing about Bronze Cafe - there are tastes and combinations you may not have thought of before. They also have soups, salads, and a coffee bar. I cannot wait to taste what I will try next.",2014-11-08 00:19:54

Here's the deal:  Everyday at lunch from 11am to 2pm I think there is an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi buffet.  They are making it fresh all the time and keep bringing out plates and plates of it for you to devour.  Also included is a small buffet of hot asian foods like egg rolls, lo mein, fried rice, calamari and some other items.  There's also dessert.  All this for....$10!  

I know what you're thinking, the sushi has to be bad, the fish is old, I'm gonna get sick!  But no, it's fresh, and delicious and many times on Saturday afternoon after a rough Friday night I've found myself there with my husband eating WAY too much and heading home for a nap.

After a long day and a debrief with my team at the hotel bar, we all went our separate directions.  I like to walk and one evening I decided to explore the various blocks of the non-yet-complete East Village area.  At some point, I came across the old Simmons mattress building, noticed a coffee shop in front, and decided to move on.  At the back of the building, I noticed some sort of restaurant activity, and immediately circled back the front and came in.

Charbar is in the back and the place was packed.  I took a seat at the front bar and decided that beer and an appetizer would be the best option. Then I looked at the menu and was thrilled with the Argentinian selections. That brought back fond memories of Gayle and I in Buenos Aires and Baraloche, dining on steak, provoleta, empanadas, maybe a side order of asparagus, all washed down with a Malbec and Dulce de leche for dessert. 

The first night I limited myself to some empanadas and provoleta (and switching to red wine), while the next night (at the bar again), I went for the gaucho burger and a smooth Portuguese red.

To be completely honest, this wasn't the place for me. It killed me though, and here is why. 

Carolyn was who took us on a tour. I work for a very large company whose main strategy is customer focus. I notice good and bad customer service every single place I go. Here's my advice to the owners:

Take some responsibility for your investment and give Carolyn a raise. She's literally the only thing you have going for you.

Carolyn took us through the entire facility and I could tell she was so passionate about weddings, quality, and her JOB.

The person who told me they would be there for my tour was a no show, and your place is a MESS. This is in no way a reflection of your service, because we were treated very well and given thorough detail of your packages by Carolyn. She also followed up twice before we made our decision to offer help. It was nice, not pushy.

There's no way I would ever pay as much as you are asking with garbage and construction materials shoved into corners and closets. Update the place. And hire more staff like Carolyn.

We arrived 35 mins prior to the opening and waited like two hours. Was it worth is. Had it been warmer very much yes. Either was it was still worth it. 

The tsukemen and the matcha soba are delicious. You can taste the earthiness of in the soba noodles. The tonkatsu soy dipping soup is flavourful, has good seasoning, creaminess from the soy, and barely a hint of spice. The accompanying chazuke that came with the kitsune soba is salty on initial taste but balances out with the rice and you don't even notice after eating a full bite. 

The teas are both high quality. The houjicha latte has a nice creaminess with the soy but the soy itself doesn't alter the overall flavour of the tea. The kabusencha is highlighted by floral notes and is much more mild than the matcha. 

The complementary Aoi Hana - Japanese High Tea has a variety of desserts with a choice of a black tea roll cake or matcha roll cake. My favourites were the Sakura ones as they had the contrast of the pickled Sakura flowers against the natural sweetness of the Mochi and the green tea/matcha and read been fillings. The cheesecake has hints of citrus (likely yuzu) zest, hit of salt, and very upfront cream cheese. 

The soufflé pancakes are like it name sake suggest not quite solid and has that inside of a soufflé wetness as a pancake. The pancake is accompanied by matcha, houjicha, and whip cream as well as a fruit cup like peach. All of the accompaniments work well with the pancake, and of course no pancake is complete without maple syrup. Not as good as Mildred's temple pancakes but still interesting.

The edges are perfectly crisp, but the softness and of the center combined with the light sweetness of the chocolate chips made that three extra dollars so worth spending. I may or may not have tried to dip it into the mocha a few times to add an extra dimension of coffee flavor into it... Which, by the way, was also pretty divine.

The Gelato was so good. They let you pick that up after you finish your meal so its not a melted mess. I got hazelnut and pistachio and it they were both delicious.

Dazzling is a modern Asian Fusion restaurant. They have cuisine from every Asian country under the sun. Thai, Viet, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, some Malay.

My gf and I came in after a Salsa class. We sure worked up an appetite. They had a prix fixe deal that I found interesting. Appetizer, entree, dessert for 23 bucks. The selection was adequate. 

Choices ranged from a Japanese sushi entree to Thai noodles. We chose the spring rolls to start, seafood fried rice and Crème brûlée to finish. We also ordered a sushi roll on the side. I forgot the name of it, but instead of the regular nori seaweed, it had a red rice flour wrapping. Inside, scallop, tuna and some veg. My gf and I thought this roll was one of the best sushi rolls we had ever experienced. The flavors were different but not too much to be unfamiliar. The wrapping gave it more of a fresh spring roll feel rather than a sushi roll, just delicious. The portion was very small, 4 pieces for around 11 bucks but it's really good.

The spring rolls we ordered were also very good. In comparison to the countless spring rolls I've eaten before, these were much better. The filling was vegetarian, but it came out fresh out of the fryer, hot and crispy. 

The seafood fried rice was a mound of delicious seafood flavour. Shrimp, squid, scallop, and a few mussels, it was all there. Typical fried rice but enough to feed 2.

Last, the Crème brûlée was a wreck. The worst I've eaten. The consistency was way off. Past the sugar crust was a flan like pudding which was scrambled in texture. Not smooth, silky and creamy as every dessert called a Crème brûlée ought to be. My gf is a Crème brûlée monster, she was ultra disappointed and upset with terrible ending to a decent meal.

Something similar already happened here, which is why I didn't go back for several months. You can see my earlier reviews for more information. I don't think they realize that when they do the customer wrong and don't fix it, it will cost them money over the long haul. In my case, a lot of money. I started ordering from them regularly for lunch. But there are plenty of other options around.

Both were moist, nice large portions.  They could have done a little bit thicker frosting.

The interior is cute, however I did feel like there was something missing -as in, it almost feels slightly unfinished.  I feel like Crumbs in NY for example you feel like there is a pull to go back into it, whereas didn't to get that same vibe here.  Maybe it's the $3.75 cupcake on paper plate vs. for example a glass plate and an accompanying cup of tea or something?  Maybe real tea pots?

Came back to try the Japanese High tea. Glad we came by around opening time as they were starting to get busy. The service was a little slow. I guess because they were still fairly new. But food and tea took long to come out. Prepare to wait 30 mins if you want to order the souffle pancake. When we went the parfaits and 2 other items were not available which was a bummer. I got the High tea to share. Serving size is small but very filling. Everything looked pretty. But most of the sweets were just sweet on sweet. Needs something else to change the flavour. That roll was really good though. I didnt get the soba noodles but our friends really enjoyed theirs. 

I think if they change the flavour profile a little. Like add something tart to the dessert it would cut through all the sweet. I mean one of the things was a little salty but I was not a fan.  

Servers were very polite. And place looks nice. But I probably wont be back to the second floor. I still love their parfaits though.

On a side note: the orders were taken together. Took a bit for the food to come out.

All kinds of Chihuly glass from chandeliers, exquisite table sculptures, foyer sculptures, & bowls - ranging from small to gargantuan

The colors in these glassworks are absolutely amazing & the light refracts in such unique ways that it's like you're getting a different sculpture from every angle.

This shop in particular also boasts some sculptures that are only found at that 1 store - so you won't see them anywhere else

Price tags are what one might expect from such a famous artist & his team.  I think the small bowl we were looking at was something like $5500 and the next fav of ours - a double bowl sculpture - was something like $9800......a true collector's dream!

But if your interest lies more in the learning & appreciation arena, there are also these really cool light-changing lithographs, DVDs, & books telling all about Chihuly's works & various exhibits......in fact, they have a video always running that showcases 1 of the Chihuly DVDs so you can see the glass being made, learn about the artist & get wowed ( like that's hard to do! )

The woman who assisted us both times we were in this shop was attentive w/out hovering.  She gladly offered us info about the pieces we were looking at but there was no sales pressure at all.

In summer, the park is great for any kind of sport. My personal favourites were croquet and badminton last summer; it's also a great place to go for a run (as long as the dogs don't chase you!). Speaking of dogs, watching all the dogs play in the leash-free area is entertainment in itself.

Later at night, it's a bonfire and drinking kinda place, and playing in the kids playground after dark is good, clean fun that doesn't make you look like a total weirdo. Plus on Tuesdays there's a Farmer's Market! Tiny but convenient and awesome.

Winter = TOBOGGANING. There is a GREAT hill on the side closer to Dundas, and all you need is a Crazy Carpet and some mittens to make sure you don't freeze to death.

There's also a pool and community center in the park that are super helpful if you have kids with a lot of energy to release. Basically Bellwoods rules, and it's great that there's a park in this area of the city that everyone can use no matter how old they are.",2008-11-19 19:19:48

Upon entering the restaurant, you will pass through their little wine shop. I always pick up a bottle in the store and bring it to my table to drink with my meal for a $10 corkage fee. Being the cheapo that I am, I always go for the cheapest, or shall I say least expensive bottle that I can find. I mean, it's always good, right?

We ordered escargot, which was amazing in a delectable garlic butter sauce - it reminded me of my favorite shrimp scampi. Next came the asparagus soup, which had the consistency and appearance of Gerber ""peas"" baby food, but luckily the soup had a wonderful flavor and the bacon and chives sprinkled on top made it that much better.

The Crab Louie Salad could have had more crab meat on it as I barely tasted any. A large amount of avocado is sliced on top and a French type dressing and capers rounds this salad out nicely.

For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding which was out of this world. I think I'd go back here just for a glass of wine and bread pudding. My friends tried the flourless chocolate cake  (which by the way was gluten free) that was drizzled with a raspberry sauce and the crème brulee, which was prepared traditionally.",2012-02-19 05:56:32

'Lunch' for me usually just means 'any meal I eat before 7pm'. Often my mid-day meals fall around 2-5pm, and that is a TOUGH time to get into restaurants. Most everything is closed between lunch and dinner. Not these good folks, though... is it wrong that I almost gave them five stars for that alone...??

So anyhow, I stopped by here at about 3:30pm, and my first impression was that it was a nice little spot. So I saddled up to the sushi bar and took a look at their offerings. Pretty typical fare, and pretty much what you'd expect from XYZ Sushi establishment. Nothing overly surprising, but a decent menu nonetheless. So I ordered a few bits of sashimi, a few cuts of nigiri-zushi, and of course my salmon skin rolls. Everything was really good! Looks like they have a decent selection of sake, and a LOT of home-made infused sake as well. The service was prompt and attentive, everyone was friendly, and the sushi was damned tasty. I was impressed that they serve ama-ebi, and even fry up the head for you. The ikura was equally tasty, and all of the sashimi that I ordered was generous, with a nice heap of daikon.

The salmon skin rolls were top-notch. I liked the little bit of spicy sauce that they put in there, it added a nice little zing.

All in all, this was a solid place. I like the fact that they're open pretty much all day, and they're close to the gym I work out at. I can't really 'rave' about their sushi, because they didn't have a lot of the stuff that I really jam out on (toro, uni, iwashi, etc). What I *CAN* say is that that won't stop me from coming back here after a workout for a quick lean-protein fix. :)",2014-01-21 02:29:11

The desserts are pretty darn good here too. I get rice pudding and mix it with fruit custard and a few pieces of milk candy. Did I mention this place is affordable? It's like 10 bucks per person and if you go as a family of three they might give you a special price if you ask them about it and go there often. The restaurant is always clean. They have a television that is always on either one of two things, indian music videos or WWE wrestling. I prefer the wrestling but the music videos are cool to watch when eating this type of food.

To me, yes they have the exact same concept and similar menus, but there is no comparing the two.

Fair warning, if your allergic to peanuts, this is not a place for you. They cook in peanut oil. On the bright side, Five Guys is excellent for those who can only eat Gluten Free. The fries have a dedicated fryer, and you can get your burgers, shall say protein style. In & Out is better in their protein style because of the way they prep the lettuce. Five Guys has shreds of lettuce that they sort of make a burger sandwich. Usually if you add extras on, everything ends up falling out and you are left with a huge mess.

One of the biggest downsides to Five Guys in the calorie count. Ohio, you would think twice if you actually saw the calorie content next to the menu items.

- Fantastic J-style fried chicken legs, perfect for soaking up lots of their amazing homemade scotch bonnet pepper sauce, which is smokin' hot but fresh and fruity and delicious.
- excellent jerk chicken, of the dark mahogany oven roasted chicken variety, always very moist and tender, with a decent kick, but not face meltingly hot. 
- uber-flaky spicy beef patties, that are really very very good.

Stumbled onto Chill while exploring the area before settling down for dinner (at Lobby's).  The clerk here was friendly and accommodating w/ sample requests.  After dinner, I came back and ordered a cup of three flavors: dark chocolate, chocolate sugar-free, and panna cotta.  I was delighted w/ all of them!  Surprisingly, my favorite of the three flavors I'd ordered was the one I had not sampled beforehand, the sugar-free chocolate.  

I definitely will be back!

He called someone over but 8 mins later no one came. 

My hubs got annoyed and wanted to leave. I found 2 employees chatting in the nearby home dept. and asked them for help. The young lady finally found someone who could help. He did his best since it wasn't his dept. 

I got my mini fridge and paid for it. Then..we went to pick it up in the pick up area located on the North side of the store. Beware there isnt an attendant. You scan in your receipt onto a machine and it rings someone in the back and they bring it out and load it for you. 

I give them 4 stars because of their prices. I found what i was looking at the price I wanted to pay for.

I fell in love as soon as he brought me the last one I met, the one I adopted and after a while playing with her, when I looked around I realized I was the only person who was still there meeting a dog and still everybody was very courteous and helpful. 
The adoption process is detailed but yet simple, they will make you questions to ensure everything is OK and that you're aware of all responsibilities and possibilities.

Although a good portion of the menu is sushi, they have a broad menu covering other cuisines which is good for my family because not everyone is a fan of sushi like me.

Four of us came on a Saturday night and decided to sit in the restaurant right by the open kitchen. But you can also order from the counter to go, pick up, or delivery. There were about three servers on the floor covering the 7 to 8 tables and the service was prompt and friendly. Wait time was minimal, orders were correct, questions were answered, and drinks were kept topped off.

The first two pages of the menu are sushi and the second half of the menu is split into Grill and Chinese sections. The Grill sections favors Japanese items but also has a little Hawaiian influence. From the sushi section, I'll usually get the chirashi bowl has a nice variety of fish for the price. The nigiri and rolls are pretty average. Other family members order from their hand rolls which are the perfect portion and dirt cheap. My daughter has been on a spam musubi kick and she was happy that they offered it.

I enjoyed the BBQ short ribs and was very pleased with the portion size and the seasoning on the ribs. They were grilled just right and served with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad. Also ordered were the teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken which come with the miso soup and a salad.

Finding Sweet Virginia Wax was a BLESSING!  Let me just tell you bluntly, it isn't easy to trust someone with such a delicate area....and I'm pretty modest so that makes it uncomfortable for me.  I had only one person doing this service for me before, so trying someone new just made me, well, grow my hair out.  I just couldn't handle that for very long so I turned to the internet in search of a new provider since flights across country for a wax were just out of the question. 

I AM A HAPPY GIRL!!! Sarah made me relax (as much as possible for me) with her personality and conversation.  I felt like I was going to like her by speaking with her on the phone when I made my appointment.  She uses a different kind of wax than what I was used to and that made me a little nervous but I assure you that what she uses is great.  I was smooth and it was WAY less painful than what I was accustomed to.  (Really though, it was only painful because it was like starting over since it had been so long....the time that had passed AND my hair!) That being said, each appointment is less painful than the last as that's just the nature of this practice.  I am shocked however, by the limited regrowth that I am experiencing.  How great is that??  

I have been so happy with Sarah's work that I decided it was time to wax other things and went in today to have my underarms done.  I had read horror stories on-line- yes....I research almost everything before I do it, and I was braced for a pain slightly akin to Hell but Sarah had me all finished up without that ever happening.  I was all worked up for nothing!!  I'm looking forward to not shaving my pits EVER AGAIN!

When I first arrived to this cute little salon, I was surprised that it was a small room with one employee, Pamela.  She welcomed me in and invited me to sit down.  Another lady was sitting in one of the chairs at the side of the room and she introduced us.  I guess she had just had a service done and was hanging out...I'm still not completely sure but either way it was comfortable and not at all awkward, although I was still very confused at this point how this whole thing worked. I have only been to large nail salons where everyone is getting services done next to each other.  

Pamela asked me what kind of design I wanted on my nails and I shrugged, as I always do, and told her I had no idea.  She showed me her Instagram (@studio108atlast) which had an entire gallery of nail designs that she had done on other clients.  As I scrolled through and decided I still had no idea what I wanted, she smiled and got started on at least taking off the horrible acrylic gel mix I had that was piled up on my nails.  She could tell I had been getting my nails done ""unprofessionally"" for a long time and she assured me she would get my nails healthy again while still keeping them beautiful. Yay!

As she worked on my nails I couldn't help but notice and point out all of the thoughtful additions to the room.  Fruit and sprig infused water, a coffee machine, a refrigerator packed with a variety of drinks and snacks, cookies in a glass case, chocolates, and even a birthday calendar with all of her clients birthdays.  So cute. I love this place already and she hasn't even finished my nails! 

I was pretty exhausted the day I came in and just wanted to relax but somehow she managed to pull my life story out of me.  I made a new friend!  Something I really never get to do at former nail salons where the language barrier makes describing my nail needs / desires merely impossible, let alone any type of conversation.  I'm used to sitting and diving into my phone. Proud to say I hardly looked at my phone while I was sitting in her chair, a huge accomplishment for me. 

My nails were super cute, totally outside of anything I could have imagined on my own. I got a pedicure done as well and was very impressed with her attention to the health of the nails and not just rushing through the job.  

Pamela is amazing and I will never go to another nail tech. Her salon is 20 minutes from my house, which is not amazing on the convenience factor but she provides quality on every level and so the drive is merely a necessity. :) Pamela at Studio 108 should be the standard for all nail salons, and I hope that many will model after her service and attention to detail.

Booking an appointment was painless, because my insurance set this up for me,  and I got my new patient paperwork from them by E-mail.

I walk in versus drive-thru.  But the wait is pretty much the same.  The only real issue is service can be slow.  When I walk in and see the line of people waiting, I remind myself to be patient.  But even then I try to see where my order should be in line.  Luckily when I'm here I don't usually have to get back to work.  So I understand the frustration when people have to walk back to the counter and check the status of their orders as they are anxious to get back out  into the world.

If you're in a rush it can be hectic.  But otherwise it's the same reliable Taco Bell as anywhere.  Good stuff!",2018-10-02 17:10:29

Mob Bar ain't a bad place to grab a drink.  It's got a nice atmosphere.  
The appetizer menu could be worse and the liquor selection is well-designed.  
The customer service?  I guess it could be worse, but most of the wait staff could use a customer service overhaul.

Mob Bar is basically the decent small bar it was when it was Side Bar.  Except now, it's got a theme.  Coincidentally, a theme that matches the opening of the Mob Museum -- located half a block away.  But I'm not one to begrudge a business with good marketing sense.

I am, however, one who thinks this city provides paltry customer service in most of its businesses.  And Mob Bar is a good example of that.  When the place gets busy, the servers get overwhelmed and take it out on the customers.  Hint for the servers: acting bitchy and entitled is not likely to earn you a good tip.  If the place is slow . . .
well, the service still moves slow, but they're friendly enough.  The bar has plenty of attractive servers, but a pretty face only goes so far when you're thirsty and hungry.

The appetizers are decent enough.  Deep fried risotto, shrimp wrapped in bacon, or a caprese salad.  You could do a lot worse in downtown, but the chef could also do a lot better.  Italian comfort food offers a lot of options, but the menu here is rather uninteresting.  And the options are rather bland--specifically the risotto balls, which just taste like ""fried"" without any other flavor.  

So let's boil it down: 1.5 stars for lame customer service and an okay-tasting menu.  Add in a star for a nice atmosphere and an interesting collection of whiskeys and gins.",2012-06-12 05:24:16

I've tried a total of four different flavors now and each one has the same moist mouth watering trait.  The chocolate-chocolate cake with the chocolate chips... so good.  It had the right amount of sweetness and wasn't too chocolately.  The first bite I took of the seasonal pumpkin spice was reminiscent of Thanksgiving dinner and really gave me a taste of autumn (even though it still feels like summer in Vegas).  I can still taste the wonderful pumpkin in my mouth.  I would've liked it if they added some chocolate chips in this one too; it would've been that much better.  

I'm a fan of sprinkles's red velvet cupcakes and I always made an effort to stop by when in the area.  That was the extent of my cravings though.  I never went out of my way to pick up a cupcake.  Nothing Bundt Cakes is a different story.  As soon as I finished up my cake, I kid you not, all i could think about was that red velvet bundt... so moist, with the chocolate chip pieces, and the sweet cream cheese frosting.  I had to compare!  Sprinkles is good, don't get me wrong, but their red velvet is really sweet and then its topped with a big whop of extra sweet frosting.  I almost always scraped the frosting off because it was overkill.  Plus, it doesn't have chocolate chip pieces, come on!!!!

I'll pass on the pecan praline.  This one didn't do much for me and didn't have that zest the other favors had.  I can't even say what I didn't like about it because after a couple bites I put it to the side; it didn't leave a memorable impression on me.  I still have to try their other favors but the red velvet alone deserves five stars.

Anyway, It's a cute little shop with friendly employees.  For a few bucks more they wrap your bundt up with a flower and a personalized note; It makes for a thoughtful gift.",2011-11-09 22:35:49

Been to some kart places before. So i thought this would be a good experience too. On arrival we need to register, computer is slow and can freeze sometimes. Then have to wait 30-60 minutes for the race. The food are pricey plus if you want a place to put your valuables you need to rent a locker. The locker is not pricey but if your paying 50 dollars for this place you would think you will have a secure place to put your items. Also let me warn you about the location it is out of nowhere, its hard to locate and in a shady part of the city. If you think these are the reasos why the place is only 1 star, you are mistaken.

Okay, so why 1 star? Please keep reading. Each points correspond to issues they need to address. (1 star taken off each point).

1. 14 laps, it says on their websites 14 laps per race. When we got to the race, I was counting how many times I have run to the flag, not even 8 counts and the last lap flag was being waved. Thats horrible, half of the price just thrown out.

2. Theres no medic staff on the spot. The staff in the race dont even have any first aid medications. As a evidence let me tell you in my second run, I was stop due to a racer keep crashing in front of me, my cart become jammed and it can not reverse any longer. When i look at my finger it was bleeding, the staff who stop me from racing saw all of this happen. I mean they saw the teenager crash and evidently me crashing in front of her. We were only few seconds apart, there was no way i could have avoided her. When they took me out of the race, the staff didnt even try to check if iam okay or if iam injured, eventhough my knuckles were bleeding. Safety is first, even scare farm has a better medic station, when you can ride a mediocre cart upto 45 miles per hour ( website claims 45 miles per hour), there should be a medic on the spot, theres no excuse for that.

3. There's intructions how to operate their cart before the race. Maybe around 50 seconds of explanation of what not to do and what to do. Like no bumping. How to reverse, and so on. This would be nice if the instructions were given in a place where you actually hear the one whose giving the instructions. The guy was yelling since he gave instructions next to the racing track. He said no bumping once, and on the race you will be bump a million times. As the kids has no regards to the rules plus i bet they never heard anything the guy was saying.

4. I think this last on, point out the worst thing about this place. Yes, worse than safety, worse than not having your full laps, worse than prices, worse than instructions. When you first do your race you will start to learn that they can speed you up or lower your speed. Thats ok for safety issues, but then again this made me feel like someone is controlling me all the time. All i controll was the steering wheel. If i wanted bumper cars I would gone to metro mall or az millz or maybe dave and busters. Anyways you then feel like they want you to go faster more than they want you to slow down. Everytime you try to slow down and just enjoy the ride, the cart wil just start to accelerate in rapid motion. No matter how light you push the pedal, it will accelerate. If no one is controlling you then they are bad carts. Makes you feel like they just want the next batch of people to go on the race, we really felt like we were being rush whike disregarding every bit of respect we needed to enjoy this place.

Overall with groupon coupons we spent 88 dolars plus 8 dollars of tax. Its 96 bucks. With the experienced we had, we would ask you people to buy 1 ticket only then experienced it before buying alot of races. It is not worth all the hassle that you have to deal just to get that rush. Then at the end of the day, if you for some reason bought and went to race, we hope you wont feel like you got ripped off.

P.S the staff at the counter were nice. The staff at the race track seems to not care about anything but to just finish their hours. Management need to retrain this guys when it comes to being a customer representative, and give respect to each of the paying customers.",2014-01-04 23:49:47

The inside of the place looks beautiful, very clean and current design. The concept is Neopolitan pizza and street food, served in the timeframe of fast food. Apparently 90 seconds to cook the pizza. It's from the pizza genius behind il Pizzaiolo, so you know it's gotta be great. I tried the Margherita D.O.C, which was like the standard Margherita except it had Mozzarella di Bufala instead of regular, and also Parmesan cheese. It was super fast, and looked delicious.... however definitely left something to be desired. The crust wasn't nearly as crunchy as expected, and disappointingly, the center of the pizza was just lukewarm. I also tried the arancino funghi, which is a fried ball of rice with cheese and mushrooms inside, served on a bed of marinara sauce. There a a few different varieties as well. When I cut into it tho, the center was also still cold. D'oh! I asked for it to be warmed up, and the staff was really nice and helpful, but when they brought it back (actually brought a whole new one) it was better, but STILL not hot on the inside. It also could have used more sauce than the tablespoon that came with it. So honestly, in general I was kinda disappointed. They just opened a month ago, so I imagine are feeling things out and working out the kinks of a new business/concept right now. And, I'd be totally fine with it taking a little longer if it was as good as il Pizzaiolo. Will definitely be back to try again in a few weeks!",2017-01-21 17:45:42

Coach House is a breath of fresh air if you're looking for breakfast in the central downtown area. There's no attitude, no needlessly fancy concoctions, and, likely, there's no lineup of hipsters doubling the amount of time it takes you to get some eggs and coffee.

Other Michaels didn't have these tiny party favor mason jar packs of 20 on sale, but here it was $13 instead of $20. They even had nicer vacuum sealed varieties here not at the other stores which was even better for the herbs I intended to put in them! 

I found good selection of yarn at the other closest Michaels on Lake Mead/Tenaya, but none were on major sale like it was here. They had a bin full of yarns for 99cent clearance. Some of these were the nicer varieties like wools, organics, etc that were originally about $6 a skein. Um, yeah I bought two of each color and there were a ton...I had like 5 bags of yarn.

Also I was passing by paint pens that are $3.99 were clearance at 99cents as well! I use those for a lot of projects and currently drawing on a wooden urn I'm making for my dog so we got one of each color.

My friend got the crab dip that we shared. It was with imitation crab. I think this was my least favorite item. 

I also had ordered a queen bee. It was so yummy I had to have two! I think all their drinks hit the spot with my group. And our server recommended some drinks to everyone!

It is a modest theatre, not the type that will wow you with luxurious and old time decoration.  It is a small theatre that there is no seat that an audience cannot see the performance within a reasonable distance.  The sound system is quite good, actually.

Outside the auditorium, the lobby is reasonable and the quality and price of the red wine is even more reasonable (big hint).  The ladies room is a bit too practical. A little fancy up, such as flowers, painting, etc.,  will be nice.

Having said all that,  Markham Theatre has done a great job bringing international performers to Toronto North.  There are many up and coming performers who I have not heard of previously.  However, when I go to Youtube and listen to their performances, some are downright amazing. Some are actually teaching music, etc..

I really enjoyed the ginger dressing on the salad. The miso soup was on point as well. The house hot sake was very drinkable, although I know nothing about sake.

Ordered takeout, eggplant parm/vegie lasagna/white pizza. Their white pizza looked amazing, got great reviews, so i went with that. Walked into the place and was instantly hit with the sweet sweet smell of an AMAZING Italian food kitchen. You only get that smell at primo places, I was happy before even getting my food.

Tip #1 -  this place is CASH ONLY. Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall seeing this on their website nor menu, But their is an ATM there.

The food is AMAZING, everything tasted great, was so damn delicious. The pizza is the unique offering -  IMO I think they use a shortening in their dough which gives the crust a semi semi puff pastry texture/flavor. It was really unique and appreciated, and especially on the white pie it went very well.

I would come from anywhere in the city to eat here, but if you're staying at the Trylon appts across the street this is a big plus being so close.

This particular chain is popular in Taiwan and already has locations in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and British Columbia to name a few. When you walk in, you can see where they get their name as it is a rather elegant looking interior that is both modern chic yet has a young vibe to it. The offerings are primarily dessert with a few pasta, pizza, and rice dishes thrown into the mix. And of course, the fruitiest drinks possible.

We went because the wife needed to have dessert as an actual meal. She can't say no. So in we went and off she went. I ordered Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken appetizer as a meal (I know...pathetic). She went with the Strawberry Ice Cream Waffle with a Pineapple soda on the side. 

I'll get the appetizer out of the way. The Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken ($7.99) was subpar. The portion size was small for what the price is. Not asking for much here, but the taste of the chicken was fine. Standard across the board and pretty much exactly like any other Taiwanese place. Would have liked something a bit different if it wasn't going to be better than the rest.

The Strawberry Ice Cream Waffle ($12.99) is definitely large enough for 2 people to share (or one fat lonely man). The ice cream are several scoops that lay across a rather unique looking waffle. They are like little waffle cups that combine into one giant waffle. You could rip off each cup and just have mini ice cream cups topped with whipped cream and strawberry. It was precisely what we did and it was great.

The Pineapple soda drink is pretty pricey ($7.50) for what equates to a glass of pineapple soda. However, they did add some diced strawberries and mint to try to fancy it up a bit. 

Servers adorn maid outfits to help all those fetishists out there. They are quick and efficient but look miserable right now. They're just starting up so hopefully they break out of it. The prices are a bit too high for me. I don't mind shelling money out, but I'd like the offerings to be up to par. Very nice place to bring a date after dinner, but rather standard.

The sunshine salad is always picture perfect and a heaping serving of tasty salad fixings. Their rice bowls are delicious, too, but my all time favorite is the pesto burger. Once I had that, I couldn't go back. These veggie burgers really changed the way I look at veggie burgers--I'm so scared to get one anywhere else because, for me, the Ice Cube has perfected this dish. I'm drooling just thinking about it right now. The sides are hit or miss. I got a Mediterranean pasta once that was strange and not so good, but the curry quinoa was SO GOOD.

The service is always accompanied by a smile, even on the snowiest, busiest, grossest downtown lunch hours, which I truly commend because I know how tough that can be. Whenever anyone questions where to go for a quick, delicious, filling, and healthy lunch, I always point to the Ice Cube because you can't go wrong. Sure there are other good lunch spots downtown, but I never feel gross or bloated when I go here and that's a plus when you have 3-4 more hours of work to get through. 

Desserts here are always good, too. The pumpkin cupcakes have delighted me multiple times, as well as chocolate pumpkin bars and brownies.

On the several occasions I've been at Eggspectation, I haven't been able to try a variety of their breakfast foods for this reason: their Southwest omelette has been so good that I order it every time I visit!

With fresh ripe avocado and salsa on top of my well cooked omelette, I am eager for my next bite even before I finished the one in my mouth. The hash potatoes that accompany the omelette are very addicting, and I end up finishing all of them even though I'm very full from my omelette.

My husband usually goes for their benedicts, and the smoked salmon is one of his favourites. Served on whole wheat toast, it's definitely going to fill you up for the rest of your day. We find that the portions are quite huge and sort of difficult to finish; we end up almost always leaving the fruit untouched, or barely touched that is because we are so full.

The rest of the drinks are alright - they always have condiments and other things always fully stocked and they are quick to get you anything that you need if not present. The coffee and tea that we always order in the morning are average but will give you the kick of caffeine that you need in the morning. As for the service, we've had good and average service when we've been; Eggspectation has always been really full of customers and so very busy! They really need to hire more servers during the busy morning hours...

Anyway, if you're new in town, Eggspectation should be tried at least once! It's a great place to start your day whether you're here for business or for leisure, or even if you live in the city!

Which was also huge.  The food was fantastic, hot, fresh, tasty, and delicious.  My son loved it with every bite.

I chose a few random ones. And order a DECAF coffee.

Old school restaurant feel and seating is a little strange, but I guess it works....they pull out the tables and you sit next to each in a booth at least if there's a small party.  The service is attentive and the waitress was extremely friendly.  The ambiance is nice, but has the typical Vegas feel when it comes to how dressy you need to be...some people were definitely dressed well, while others were in jeans and tank tops...

The meal starts with the signature spinning salad...given the fact I abhor salads...this one was actually pretty tasty! Next the prime rib cart with the sides comes over and you can select how you prefer your cut of prime rib and the sides offered are fatty heaven as well.  We selected the creamed corn and creamed spinach.  The creamed corn was a little too sweet for my liking, but the creamed spinach was delicious with little pieces of bacon mixed in.  The meal also comes with mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding (an eggy/bread mixture).  Portions are more than generous and you leave anticipating the food coma to hit!

The hamachi had good flavor but mine had a piece of bone in it. 
The salmon tacos were small for the price and the fried wanton was too greasy (I like the idea but it wasn't as tasteful as I thought)

First, adult ticket prices are always $14 or higher.  There are no matinee discounts, nor are there any child/senior discounts for shows after 6 pm.  There is no in-seat ordering which doesn't really bother me, but I would expect it at this price.  There are no 21+ theatres.  The only thing deterring your sitting next to a crying baby is the ticket price.  The only parking is garage parking if your movie ends after mall closing, and that's just creepy at night.  I would be uncomfortable if I were alone, as I didn't see any increased security.  I was also confused upon entering the garage as to which way to go to park closest to the theatre entrance.

It's also strictly reserved seating which is both good and bad.  It negates the ability to decide spontaneously to see a movie as you could very well show up to a sold out movie.  If you want to ensure a decent seat, add on a convenience charge to buy your ticket online. 

So what do you get for $14?  Some additional food/beverage options.  They do have some LGO treats at the small cafe (which does not serve meals, only small plates) and a gelato bar.    And an uncomfortable recliner.  

The recliners are my biggest disappointment in fact.  Not only are they more uncomfortable than a traditional seat, but Harkins did not do the seating layout in pairs or quads.  Although you do naturally get more leg room and therefore, the auditoriums are smaller, it's a standard seating plan with shared armrests.  So instead of sitting next to a total stranger, you get to lie next to one.  YUCK!  

Will I go again?  Probably, but only because it is the closest theater to me.  However, yesterday, we drove to Tempe because we decided to go last minute, and it wasn't worth the hassle (nor did we have the time) to go through the logistics of online ticketing and parking.",2016-02-28 16:08:13

First thing you need to know is that there are only two of us girls at our department at the office. It is a male-dominated group. 
Second thing is management occasionally treats the office to lunches and dinners as a treat and the staff discusses where to go for an hour in advance...
So, in advance of our group lunch the VP asked where everyone wants to go and to no ones surprise Earls, Cactus Club and the Duke pubs were popular choices...why? The women of course.... someone suggested that we should change things up and go to Moxie's which apparently has ""top shelf"" ""10/10"" models in super short skirts and mini dresses, so on and so forth (lol - and we girls are just listening, reading the emails that are going back and forth and laughing) and our VP thought it is a great idea because he has always liked Moxie's and so it was decided....

First, this Moxie's is newer, has a very nice front entrance and similarly nice interior. it is spacious and comprised of different sections. One can sit in the dining or lounge sections...
We ended up in the dining section and the hostess efficiently rearranged things and moved things around and placed the group in the centre of the dining section across from the bar with no fuss.

Unfortunately for the group the hostess was dressed in a regular cargo pants or something, which is just fine if you are there to eat and focus on food and the team let that pass, but when the waitress also showed up wearing pants the team was openly groaning and making jokes about it, which is the embarrassing part. I am 99% sure the waitress heard the guys complain and loudly discuss with each other that the waitresses are disappointing them and are in fact looking... boring or something. It was embarrassing and funny to have the waitress dropping off menus and overhear half a dozen guys complain that Moxie's is not good anymore and has gone downhill. Wow. Anyway, the waitress was professional and pretended not to have heard a thing and provided good service. To tip less... Apparently, the uniform at the restaurant is black pants even for the girl behind the bar, which was a topic of conversation.

Apparently, the team won't be coming back, but what about everything else? The washroom was clean and well stocked. Like every other Moxie's I have been to it was modern and well designed. There is a fake fireplace at the entrance and the lights are dim.

The food was what you expect. The surprises or original creations are rare but they are happy to customize and make substitutions for you. I had the taco pokes and was disappointed because they had no taste whatsoever. The tacos shells were lined with something green (pesto perhaps?), but were it not for the hot sauce container included it would have been plain vanilla eating... speaking of the hot sauce container it was a nice touch sitting on the plate - assuming it was clean. See my photo. The Tomato Bisque soup was average, nothing special and could have used a little more taste. The waitress recommended drinks' special and I think the team didn't want to linger or stay long any more so passed. No special menu items were available or suggested so everyone ordered different items.
Prices seemed average and everything on the menu has calories attached in parenthesis which is very good. We should all pay attention to it.",2017-03-24 01:07:23

FOOD: The menu was fairly consistent with what you expect from any Pho place, so I went with a ""Beef Satay Noodle Soup"" and a HK style tea.  My soup was of a respectable size, and met my standard for meat/noodle/spiciness ratio - so no complaints here.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: The lone server almost seemed annoyed to actually have to serve customers (place was empty other than us). She forgot our orders, despite there only being 3 of us, and was generally socially awkward from the very start. One of my pet peeves is when the server literally stands over you after handing over the bill, waiting for you to pay immediately while they wait. Overall, poor customer service.

I've now frequented and different times (afternoon, early evening, etc.) and I always wait in line FOREVER. Even with just one or two in front of me, the wait is painful. I often see people walk out of the place because the line is moving too slowly. 

The employees don't greet you as soon as you walk in. Instead, they continue working in the back and it takes a while for anyone to say ""boo"" to you. One of the most annoying things is them taking my order, but then taking other orders right after me and make all the smoothies at the same time. So, essentially, I'm receiving my smoothie at the same time as two or three of the customers who stood behind me. This is extremely frustrating when you've already waited in line for a while. My suggestion would be to take one order at a time, complete that person's order, and then take the next one. This keeps the waiting system fair.

I went with the Porkopolis, wet, no crunch.  Delicious....I mean nothing in Cleveland like it Delicious.  The Au Jus really doesn't need to do the meat any justice because the quality of beef and pork deserves its own kudos, the Jus only adds to the perfectness of each sandwich and if you want to get technical, the Jus softens the bread to make it a little easier to eat but also slopifies it. 

As the rest of my party discussed how good the sandwiches were, I was too busy texting friends to come down and get a damn sandwich.  Even at the $9 eyesore, once you get a sandwich, you'll pay that all day, every day.

Leftovers were great, so don't feel the need to eat it in one sitting but good luck trying to resist.

We were able to order and eat in the Old Angle while we enjoyed a couple Christmas Ales.

Best sandwich was the Philly, wet, no crunch.  Crunch is crumbled chips which were good but got a little soggy after the wet and added more saltiness to something already salty enough.  Go dry with crunch and dip, that will suffice.  Great mushrooms.  Cheese rocked, didn't congeal too much.  Bread was perfect.

The decor is wonderful, and I don't usually comment on decor--it's simple, tasteful, and genuine, just like the food. Breakfast biscuits are a bit pricey but Huge, with thick cut bacon. I had one phenomenal shrimp and grits dinner where every bite was perfection and then another meal where my fried chicken was really dry, so I'm not sure how consistent it is--time will tell. The bacon cornbread appetizer radiates butter, but it's delicious and worth the temporary waddle. If you are uptown and jonesing for meat and three, this is a good standby.

I want to power down a star for the bakery bread, but can't bring myself to because I really do like what they are trying to do. The baguettes are all sourdough (strange and taste specific), and one was already fairly stale the day I bought it. Still, I think they are working on getting the bakery wheels turning steadily, so that's okay. And I know if I had gone back and said it was a little old, they probably would have given me a fresh one without a fuss. Nice folks work here.

Update--this place has stayed interesting, but the addition of a massive cross in the center of the dining room is a bit much. It's pretty churchy vibe now, less like a quiet urban southern food today than it was.",2013-07-12 14:52:23

Located right across the street from the TIFF Lightbox, MMW is ideal for the theatre-goer crowd + takeout for people living in the area.

Highlights:  Salmon/Avo roll (built) with masago.  I believe it was $7.50-8.00, but it was nice and fresh.  It was also nice that you can make anything a combo (either salad OR soup + a drink, including green tea) for an additional $2.99.  

I met one of the owners who looked like George Lopez and he was really nice.

Skip:  Soy sauce-based dressing for salad was waaay too salty, so don't pour the whole thing on.  

And is yakisoba Japanese for instant noodles?  Skip this offering as well as that's what it tasted like with the msg-flavouring to boot.  I wasn't too fond of the seasoning that was used.

After sleeping on it for a day , we decided to bring it back because it made our backs hurt. We waited a few days before we returned it because of time. Yesterday (Thursday), we went to Big Lots and the lady in the front, Kim, said that she spoke to a manager and that it could be returned. There was one condition, for everyday that I have it, a percentage would be taken off because it was not it was not in its original packaging. Because Kim did not know how to do it, she called Jeff, who is another manager (Store #4500) said that I should come back on Friday because he was closing in 40 minutes. I guess it would've been a different story if I was buying something. So I went back to the store this afternoon and Karen Scrotin the Asst. Store Manager advised me that they could not take the bed back because it was used. I told her that we slept on it for a day and its been sitting in our room until we could bring it back. She refused to take it back but said I can go to another store and return it. She advised me that there are signs and that every 15 minutes the return policy is played every 15 minutes. You cannot hear what is being said and there are no signs about the mattress return policy in the furniture area. This did not make no sense to me. So I called all the other stores and spoke to different managers and furniture sales people at Big Lots and they all said the same thing. They cannot give me a full refund and for every day I had the bed, they would deduct a percentage. They also said that as long as I had my receipt, it's within 30 days and the bed has no stains, I can return it. I spoke to Jesse at store #4491 and he said that if store #4560 read through the policy's, I can return the bed. I finally got a hold of the District Manager, David Nielson, and he said I could return the bed but will deduct 20% off the bed. I was totally happy but, its something. When we took it back Karen said her DM does not know what he is doing that stomped outside and cut the bed up. Then had one of her guys come out and help my husband put it up on the truck. Then we were advised to go to the back and drop it in the dumpster. Moral of the story is that they lack customer service and need to be more clear on what the return policy is. 

If you buy anything from Big Lots, make sure that everything is in the package and has never been opened or you will be SOL. There is no 30 day policy with receipt if you opened the item.

And so close to home was a huge bonus! I invited a friend to join me for a belated birthday brunch, and was truly looking forward to a nice brunch.
I hadn't realized it was part of the Union shops at Biltmore - I had envisioned an actual restaurant. We were lucky to be the first ones there - as we were able to get one of the three tables they have outside. 
For our food selections, we decided to share two savory crepes (the chicken Florentine and the turkey/Swiss) and one sweet for dessert (Nutella and strawberry). I requested a large coffee and water to drink. I truly appreciate they do everything fresh in house, daily. However, when the birthday boy was placing his drink order, they were unable to provide his first two requests (lemonade and iced tea), as they weren't made yet. He settled for a large coffee.
At the register, I had to remind the employee of the dessert crepe (which struck me as odd, as I asked him which his favorite was, and agreed to go with that - of the three crepes - that was the one HE chose.) We sat outside and waited for the food.
The turkey and Swiss came first - the chicken Florentine about 5 minutes later. Both were okay, as far as the fillings went, but the crepe itself was not what I'd envisioned. In my experience, the crepe batter should be mostly egg, with some batter. This was more like a watery pancake batter with some egg - and was definitely on the sweet side. That flavor was fine for the sweet crepe, but didn't entirely work with the savory ones. Also, it wasn't as delicate (possibly cooked too long? Possibly too much of the batter:egg ratio?) as it should have been. For lack of a better description, it seemed to be closer to quesadilla than crepe.
The coffee apparently is made in a machine that is supposed to automatically add cream. ""Luckily"", they forgot to add the cream in the machine, so we were first given black coffee. The birthday boy drinks his coffee black, so the mistake was the only reason he got the right thing. (Very good to know - it would have been quite the let down if he was told he couldn't have any of his first three choices - and who know black coffee would have to be a special request.)
When the coffee was brought out, I (again) requested a water. Asked twice, never received. The devil's in the details - and if everything else was absolutely perfect, I likely would have let that go - but there were enough missteps both in food and service that the lack of water just added to the list.
The fillings in each of the crepes were fine, and what was expected. There was nothing bad in what we ate - but nothing that made either of us WOW, and no reason either of us will be pushing to go back again.
It wouldn't take much to add an extra star - and I am sure some of this is just new business kinks that will work themselves out - but for now, when I need a crepe fix, I will look elsewhere. (I know of at least two other places in town doing them right.)",2016-02-28 16:23:37

Some will only admit to liking Dogz, whereas others admit to liking Siz Pax and Dogz but not Ds. However the truth is, most girls like all three. But here's a secret. Most boys do too. Especially this boy. (tosses hair). Hi stud.

What to get: Chicago Dog
Why: Because it's really overpriced and who doesn't like giving money away
What?: Nah but really though it's a good dog for sure.

So when I'm being charged $6 for what Chicago locals will charge you $3 for (and make better, usually), I'm all ready to give a 3 star review. The wait time was about 10 minutes for my dog (but they said it'd be 20), the place was packed wall to wall with families and drinkers and diners and socialites (if Pitt has socialites) and barflys and kids and did I mention kids, but there was a surprising lack of hot Pittsburgh girls (Pitt has spectacular women!), maybe because hot dogs aren't really a hot girl thing? I have no idea. The crowd was definitely a sausage fest, though. Both literally and figuratively.

Service was okay, I did appreciate that they managed to find me in the mess of people to give it to me. My hot dog, I mean. What did you think I meant. And the decor in here is pretty awesome, from their massive ""beer room"" to their ""grimy bar that isn't really grimy"" look. I think it's a well done place that will appeal to people with sausages (or who love sausages - the kind you bite into without anyone screaming, except vegans perhaps), and I like it.

I do not like the prices at all, but the Chicago dog was so surprisingly enjoyable and well done and good (though not the most ""authentic"" but who needs authentic when it tastes fantastic, really), that although I would rather pay 3-4 than 6 for this thing, I still have to give it a 5 stars because it's too good of a hot dog to give it less.

Be careful getting in and out of the place. The cars on the street outside drive way too fast for such a public and busy area, and between all the drunk people and narrow lanes and parked cars and high speeds with complete idiots who have probably been drinking and are driving through a sea of bar-goers and families trying to get into Ds and other places, accidents could easily happen out here, especially crossing the street.

Add on the ridiculous garnish and the giant knife sticking out of every plate and you start to feel like a juggling act. The layout of the tables is a bit awkward if you have any sort of assistive devices. A party with a walker that was seated further in had a bit of trouble getting between the table and a divider chain between the tables and restaurant. Ultimately they had to pull the walker through leaving their party member to walk those few feet without it.

I love this place for a few reasons. For one, it's a mom and pop shop, and I like supporting small businesses. Also, the quality of their dishes is 5 star. Every single item that goes into their Sandwiches, Salads, Tacos, Soups, etc. is well thought out, and sourced based on quality.

The last time I was here I had the Arctic Char Salad, and it was exquisite. Light and fresh, with a great lemony vinaigrette. Truly, this is food you can feel good about eating.

I would be bold to say that the Sandwich is their best seller. I've had it on numerous occasions with different types of fish, and have been very satisfied each time. The success of this sandwich has a lot to do with the fresh fish, and also this perfect bread that they source from a Portuguese Bakery. It's crusty on the outside, and squishy on the inside, just the way I like it.

I was there one time when they were just about to close, and the owners were telling me that bread that's not used on the same day is turned into breadcrumbs for other preparations. That in itself demonstrated to me how committed they are to quality.

Fish lovers will dig this place. Non-Fish eaters will come here with apprehension, and leave wondering why they ever denounced Salmon. It's a win-win for all!",2013-07-07 02:15:35

I called and spoke to the ""owner"" who first told me I could come drive there and pick it up. I told the wonder that to drive there and pick it up would be absurd, as the entire REASON I payed extra for delivery was that I was working late and could not leave. Then the wonder told me to call UBEREATS and said it was the fault of UBEREATS.Then the owner said he would maybe drive the food over to me, but then he said that THE KITCHEN WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO. He told me that the next day I could call and he would deliver the one item. It meant one of the people that was with me had to share an entree and we were both still hungry.

Let's start with the good news: the service was quite good. Nice service all around. Warm, friendly. You usually expect this from a Thai restaurant and they delivered on this very well.

Now onto the less stellar aspects.. the food is bland. When I go eat Thai food I expect - and really want - to be slapped  in the face with a giant hammer of flavor. I need to feel the pain! The spices! The flavor assaulting my very core from every angle. Not so much here... Very bland flavors that left me without any sort of teary eyes, runny nose or deep satisfaction when delicate balance meets raw power - which is usually the staple of great Thai food. The dishes should punch your guts in but gently, and politely. It usually brings along friends to accompany the spiciness. Here I got a long highway paved with pillows and elevator music.

Blandness.

No depth, no balance, not enough flavors. Yea you feel spiciness but that is never enough on its own.

We had 5 dishes and they ranged from being just weirdly put together like their cucumber salad with a sweet cough-like-syrup to being OK like their tofu with red curry. The spring rolls were under-seasoned which to me takes out a few stars right from the get go. The sauce was quite poorly made - I could do better and I am terrible in the kitchen. You simply cannot serve food at your restaurant like that.

Sorry for the lack of detailed description but my meal there is a long lost memory of mine and Chao Phraya has been put in my ""never go back there"" stash. It's not terrible but when there are dozens of other choices out there, why even bother?

The people working there seem really nice, honest people. i would suggest to consider changing some of their kitchen staff.

The ladies need their eye candy too, and I was quite impressed! :} He could've passed as a pop-idol or something, fo' realz ladies!

Walking in, the menu is pretty small and could be a little confusing. I looked for a minute then decided on an iced caramel coffee with added boba. I found the boba on the softer side, almost gooey, and there were a whole lot of them left when I finished my beverage [1/4-1/3rd of the cup?]. The combination wasn't as delicious as I had hoped, but the coffee had a good flavor [slightly bitter, earthy notes complimenting a lightly-sweet caramel background]. I think the combination of coffee and boba was just incongruous to me, so next time I'll try a fruity flavor instead or green tea for the win. 

They have a cute little chalk menu listing daily specials or a new menu, as well as having soups and pastries available on top of the frozen treats.  There's a small area for hanging out in, but it's pretty minimal. I opted to take my drink to go but a couple was enjoying the space while I dropped in.

It seems like it's a good addition to the overall Greenland space, so I'm glad it's there. The coffee itself isn't ridiculously outstanding when it comes to higher-standard brew [free-trade, organic, sustainable, shade-grown, etc] but it's not bad, either.

The Betty's Ale was light, like a Coors. But not as bad. Get the Ass Ale. It's more amber and doesn't taste like water. 

The Pumpkin Ale was good so I have hope that the other homemade beers they offer are probably good as well.

First off, happy hour is good and lasts until 7.  Good for us folk on the west side who can't make it back from our jobs in the big city until 6.

Beer selection is ok.  A few of the typical on tap and always something nice on the ""guest"" tap.  I do have to say that the bar tenders are pretty tight on their pours of the hard stuff.   Because of this I pretty much stick to beer at Dillon's.

The bar is comfortable with a ton of TV.  Many are new, nice, flat screens.  Problem (BIG) is that they are not connected to HD.  What???  

Oh how I would love to watch NFL there.  Fix the HD issue and you'll definitly have several more customers on Sundays.

The BBQ is darn good.  I do my own so am pretty picky.  This also means a very rarely order it.  They do a great chicken fried steak (and chicken).  Fries are good.  Gravy, both white and brown are good.

This location is undergoing a big changing of the guard right now with two of their long time bartenders 5 months pregnant.  The new girls definitely need some work but hopefully Carl, the very affable manager (did you try the velvet hammer yet?), will get them in line.  I'll give it some time.

The best thing that keeps me coming back are the bar specials.  They are good all the time, as long as you are in the bar.

We then moved to the bone marrow with marmalade: bone marrow very salty yet overall a very mediocre and not a memorable dish... very disappointing. We ordered the grilled cheese with bacon dumplings and tomato soup: it did not taste anything like grilled cheese and the tomato soup tasted more like chef boy-r-d ravioli sauce. Just no!!!  Underwhelming. We tried the onion rings and do not get the hype... not better than anywhere else yet overpriced. Our waitress recommended the Brussels sprouts: why???? They were horrible, and I like Brussel sprouts! We barely touched any of it as it was awful. Our last two dishes were the Thai chicken main course: delicious!!! The other was the scallops: again, why the hype? They were more bland and boring than yummy.

When I asked what KFCs here aren't run by his franchise, he smirked and said, ""We run all the KFCs in Nevada and Arizona, so you don't have a choice"".

Look, I respect individual franchisees' decisions to assess their economic situations independently and not take certain coupons.

They don't mess with the patty and just let it cook and flip it over then put it in the bun. I'm so sorry we just had lunch because I really want to try one.

The restaurant serves up ayce meat varying from different seasoned steaks, chicken and pork. They also offer a mini buffet/salad bar as an appetizer option, nothing too fancy just your average pasta, potatoes, greens etc. As for the steaks, you'll have servers walking around with sticks of meat coming around to offer you a chunk, pretty awesome as you get to try a bit of everything. Most of the meats were really good and well seasoned as they were able to showcase different flavours. I was surprised at how well done their chicken was, very moist. Recommended meats to try are the garlic sirloin and top sirloin. They usually bring the same meats around repeatedly so if there's a specific meat you wanted to try that's listed on their menu, you can put out a special request. They also offer desserts after you've finished pigging out and that includes their grilled cinnamon pineapple and deep fried banana which were both delicious!

The guys scrubbing my car could have been a little more gentle with the wooden part of the scrubber that holds the bristles. The one little guy hit my car with it wrong side down! I heard this ""Thunk"" and I was like freaking!!! If I get a dent in my Lexus because of his carelessness!! Fortunately, no dent. Really don't need that stress though.

I have been coming here for years. It gets busy,it gets backed up and that causes these guys to rush and when they rush it shows in a bad way. Water spots or wax streaks left on my car etc.

Most of the time I have my own towels and go over it again when I get home. 

Looking forward to the day when I leave completely satisfied, because there is ALWAYS 2 people drying the cars, not just occasionally. Plus the attention to detail when training their employees on how to treat these cars, would be most appreciated! *Ahem Management please take note. Thank you :)",2016-09-14 06:54:20

This store in particular can get pretty crazy and you definitely should have an appointment. If you don't, though, they will do their best to get you one while you are there. 

I love that you can wander around and play with gadgets as long as you like. All the employees are helpful and not pushy or intrusive. My boyfriend is actually in an appointment (where, of course, they are fixing something on his 2 1/2 year old laptop for free) and I am sitting across the store working and no one is bothering me. Earlier I was looking at the newest laptops since I am in the market and the differences were explained very thoroughly and when I said thanks for the info that was it! No hard sell, they just let me wander off. 

Apple is definitely doing things right here.",2015-05-20 21:22:01

Once we placed our orders, filled our drinks, and sat down our burgers were delivered. They looked great and I was ready to dig in.  Although I wasn't a huge fan of the smash sauce, the burger was cooked perfectly. The cheese covered the burger and was melted too perfection. And, the pickles, OMG, classic dill, great on a burger!
As for the fries, I could eat them everyday.  Shoestring fries perfectly cooked, a little crisp but soft on the inside.
As others have mentioned prices are high for a fast food burger chain, but knowing the burgers are cooked fresh upon ordering and definitely don't taste like other ""fast food"" burgers, they are worth it in my mind.

I was actually on my way home from RC Willey when I saw this store. I pulled over to check Yelp because I wanted to make sure it was a trustworthy distributor and I was astounded by the number of 5-star​ reviews. I decided to take a chance and went in. 

I was blown away by how simple and painless the process was. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by an associate. I explained that I was only looking for a box spring and he showed me the two options: white or black. He gave me a simple price that was lower than anywhere else I'd found and told me they could deliver it the next day. I paid $50 for delivery and haul away which is still $10 cheaper than just delivery was at any other store I'd checked.

The overall service was alright, but not a place for a meal.  Its moreso made for desserts, and teas.

Modeled on Osaka's street food eateries, Imadake offers some wonderful hard-to-find Japanese foostuffs including melt-in-your-mouth tako yaki, Japanese deep-fried octopus balls which were just amazing. Their seafood salads were excellent also with the earthy sesame seed dressing.

The menu is cut up in two sections, those small appetizer-like dishes of which you can order many and share with a friend, think of it as Japanese tapas. The other side is the hefty Ramen noodle soups and meals. 
Desserts have the predictable green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream and black sesame ice cream, as  well as the green tea cheesecake.

Overall, it's not a huge restaurant, and it's right down by the beach. It can definitely get quite busy over the weekends, but they also take reservations. If you go on weekdays, it's typically okay to walk-in - call ahead to confirm how busy it is.

We ordered the build-your own platter to our liking - there is no preset BBQ platter if that's what you're looking for, but they do give good recos. The unfortunate thing was that the Burnt Ends (which we were really looking forward to) weren't available until after 7:30pm... so it was a little bit of a WTF moment especially since we were there for 6pm dinner, which is normally prime dinner hour...

Sauces: there's around 6 homemade BBQ sauces that you can use to accompany your meats. They range in sweetness, smokiness, etc. Nice variety.

1855 Angus Brisket: probably the best piece of meat. It's moist, tender, and has a crispy outside. would definitely recommend. 5/5
1/3rd LB $12

smoked bird wings: These were pretty good, crispy but bone dry. You dip these wings in your choice of tableside sauces. 3/5
5 wings $11

Jalapeno and cheddar smoked sausage: super duper dry sausage. Probably wouldn't recommend. 2/5
1/2LB $10

St Louis side bones: large portion, probably only needed 1/3rd rack. Good flavour but on the dry side. 3/5
2/3 Rack $32

Baby back bones: These were probably the better ribs. They had a nice sauces over them and were well seasoned. AS you would expect, they were much more tender.4/5
1/3 Rack $17

The grilled corn was killer. the downside was that it only came with 1.... that was a little lame. 5/5

Went in to get a new phone and sign up under my sister. Got there right around 5 and the crew that was there was great. They greeted, assisted, and followed up. 
I left for about 30 min to weigh costs and such. I return to the store and a whole new crew is in. 
I walk in talking on my phone with my sister about the game plan. I head over to the phones and am engrossed in conversation with her. Hello, we're talking money here. I end my conversation with the sis and wait around for someone to help. 2 verizon reps I see are helping others. There's one behind the counter looking busy. I actually thought she was getting ready to leave for the day since she was avoiding eye contact and scurrying around getting things in order it seemed. So I patiently wait. 
4 others come into the store. Girl behind the counter runs over to them and checks them all in before me. Wth?! Completely rude since it honestly felt as if she completely ignored my presence to help them. I was no more than 2ft away from them. 
I confront her and she says ""I did go over to you and said hi"" I said ""I've been here and was here before those four ppl showed up"" she says ""I did go over to you and said hi"" as if that's all she could say. 
I'm not calling her a liar, but if I didn't see or hear her did it happen? 
I honestly think she purposely ignored me as payback. 
That's not how customer service works Melissa (pretty sure that was her name, she had half of it covered with a jacket) all I could see was Mel.

 * 9/20/13:  I went to get the new iPhone 5s.  The process was very organized.  The Store employees used cards that represented what was available.  You stated the model, color, size, and carrier you wanted and the Apple employee checked if they had a card, which represented the stock the Store had available.  Then you either could wait in line with the card or could come back in later in the day when there were less people around.  If you waited in line, the Apple Store provided drinks and other snacks for you.  The use of the cards kept the Store's crowd to a reasonable size.  This was a brilliant idea, as those not buying the iPhone on that day could still go in and conduct other transactions without issue.  Everyone was very friendly on this day and made the process of buying the new phone enjoyable.

 * 10/29/13: I went in to return an accessory item that did not meet my expectations.  The girl who greeted me was friendly and, knowing the issue would require approval to rectify, immediately took me to a manager.  The manager on duty listened to my issue and took action above what I had anticipated.  This had me in and out of the Apple Store within 10 minutes and much happier than when I arrived.

I crave spicy food & was hoping this would compliment, in a different manner, my love for Indian food.  I'm always open to different cuisines, hoping to find my new fav.

Needless to say from my 2 star rating, this won't make my top 5 list.  First I did not care for the sponge bread nor did anyone else in my party.  It was rather tasteless & the consistency made for a better dish rag than food source.  Our party of three ordered the Meskerem combo, the veggie combie, and a chicken dish.  The lentils that came with all three were extremely bland & not even in the ballpark as the lentils I've had in Indian restaurants.  Where's the spice?  The greens that came with my chicken dish were pretty good, but for some unknown reason, the greens that came on my wife's veggie combo were just plain nasty.  Uneatable.  The chickpeas had no flavor at all.  The best items on the menu were the beef and chicken dishes that came in some brown sauce which had an element of heat, perhaps the only redemption to an otherwise forgettable meal.

So I left with the question ""Is Meskerem just a bad version of Ethiopian cuisine or is all Ethiopian cuisine bad?""   Is this really the ""perfect opportunity to enjoy the unique spices and culinary mastery of Chef Tigest's skill"" as Meskerem's website states?  How does the spiciness of this cuisine compare with a fine Indian restaurant?  Is the sponge bread as good as naan bread?  No way.  Is any item they served better than most Indian dishes I've tried.  No way.  All three members of my party agreed.

Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.  Just because a cuisine is unique does not make it good.",2009-12-12 12:44:13

- Rabbit meat and it taste just like chicken with a nice spicy kick. I tried a bite from it and it was good.

The garlic and herbs were pulled straight from the farm, diced, and spread over the fries. Awesome.

My friend told me I had to check out the bathroom, which was something out of the Jetson's or Buck Roger's. I don't know what old skool show they were playing (something from the 60s). 

Out back was a huge huge tree with tables all over. I loved the sign that said to keep off for fear of falling and scorpions. Lol. My 5year old definitely stayed away. We walked around, took pictures, ate, and checked out the gardens by The Coffee Shop (which I will hit next time).

how do you know a relationship is at its caliber? when both parties are able to withstand all obstacles, right?


well, for me, it was cold and windy and about 9:50pm when my friends and i decided to go to the nearest pho place next to our house. luckily Sidestreet closes at 10:30pm, so we got there, got sat, and ordered by the time is was 10.05pm. my two friends barely opened their menu, and the lady already was trying to take their order. 

my one star represents that our soup came out fast and they weren't blatantly rude--at best.

when we got our soup, it wasn't even that hot, it was barely warm. i assure you, the meat was decent but the soup wasn't hot, therefore the pho wasn't the best experience. the staff didn't even come over to see if our empty cups needed refills. granted, they're closing up and setting up other tables taking care of other things. i noticed the staff greeting nicely to others but just because we were the last ones there just ten passed closing, not the same type of ""genuine"" service, as if we're a burden. [insert big eyed-emojicon here] Not a big deal for you, just for me. On that note, i'll just make my way to spring mountain where im worth their business.

We had such high expectations of Mastro's having been to their other locations.  Celebrating our wedding anniversary and completely giddy, we sat down, ordered cocktails and dove into the incredible bread basket.  Our waiter seemed annoyed with us from the start, but no big deal, we ignored it.  I ordered chicken (please spare me the ""you don't order chicken at a seafood place"" lecture...I ordered it because it was on the menu, so let's get through that, k? Lol).  Our waiter was non-existent all evening, so he wasn't around at all for me to tell him that the chicken was glaringly under-cooked.  The manager happened to see us looking around and took it back to the kitchen.  He brought the same re-cooked piece back, but one spot (it was a really thick piece) still didn't look ok.  We had the flash light out and kinda debated if it was cooked enough, but the chance of eating slightly under-cooked chicken and getting sick was not an appealing option to me.  (And should I be having this debate at such a fine restaurant?).  I decided not to chance it, but not say anything.  The manager saw me not eating (our waiter was still in abandonment mode), took it away and insisted on replacing it with a filet.  The filet came out and was delicious and we were happy, albeit the mood had changed.  We felt like we had done something wrong.  Honestly, our least favorite meal of the whole weekend.  No butter cake, no second drinks--happy anniversary to us.  :(

Drinks: I had a great drink that was a twist on a French 75.  It was made with cucumber.  It was sweet but not too sweet.  My bf had the rooftop cooler, which he loved.  I am not a fan of ginger beer (their use of ginger beer is actually one of the only things I don't like about this place.  I always order crown and ginger and then remember I don't like ginger beer too late!)

Meal: I had the beef burger.  It was cooked correctly, the toppings were good, pickle was yummy, and the fries were hot and deliciously herby.

My boyfriend had devils on horseback and the Fred Flinstone.  Well, half of it, because it is way too much for one average sized person to finish!  It was an impressive dish.  Though I didn't try it, he thought it was great.

Service: Our server was named Adam, if I remember right.  He was friendly and helpful.  He brought us a taste of scotch that he recommended and an extra devils on horseback!  I think he probably was trying to compensate for the fact that he knew the Fred Flinstone takes a long time to prepare, but we really didn't mind.  He warned us ahead of time that it takes a while.

Atmosphere: We sat in the front window area.  We were the only people in there until close to when we were leaving.  If there were more people in there it may have been cramped but it was nice and quiet while we were there.

Sounded good, so here I went tagging along. It is in the middle of a business/industrial park area. Signs advertising $2.99 breakfast & $4.99 lunch special... I figured how in the world I never heard of this place. It is a small free standing building, the inside looks just like any Greek-owned diner. Sat down and I found most lunch specials are $7.25-7.95. They have special of the day which was $5.99 BBQ plate with fries and slaw. Or $4.99 fried catfish sandwich. All of the sudden it doesn't look so bargain anymore. 
I went with country fried steak ($7.95) that came with 2 sides. I just wasn't feeling fried catfish or BBQ. I should have made myself feel like them however, because my dish was plain scary looking. I don't think any real gravy can be that white and thick. It wasn't even a hint of flavor besides an odd sourness to it. I wasn't expecting alot, i even expected processed steak, but I am shivering just to think I actually ate that. I am impressed by my courage and strong stomach. The entire dish was just... bad, rice was barely warm. I didn't want to make a big deal since I was with my coworkers and we needed to get back to work. My sides were a lot more natural looking, collard green and cabbage. 
I did get the complimentary soup, potato soup which in comparison to my lunch entree was a culinary masterpiece. My coworkers opted for the complimentary dessert which was peach cobbler. In my humble opinion fruit cocktail overed by 2 little pieces of arbitrary crusts isn't peach cobbler. By the way, I tasted the BBQ plate, it was a lot more edible than my steak.  
Oh, they have the best iced tea in town allegedly. And the old southern lady waitress was all ""huney"" and ""sweetie"" at us. If that makes a difference for you. I guess this place is better for breakfast, and FORGET ever ordering anything with gravy. You will thank me.

The raw fish here is really really fresh and it's also very good. The other courses are also good as well. I would say they are between better than average and good.

My main gripe is that I wouldn't pay $125/person for that tasting menu. I would pay about $80-90 for it. If it was set at that price, then I'd give Zen 4 stars.

My favorite drink is the Hokkaido (tastes like milk & honey), and they also have a great Thai tea, oolong, matcha, jasmine and almond. Lots of great choices & the only one that was too strong for me was the rose milk tea. 

The tea house itself is tiny and super contemporary. I love it's charm and I've become a regular here. Looking forward to experimenting with more options and trying more flavors.",2015-11-22 21:34:12

Met a few Yelpers on a nice Sunday afternoon for lunch.  The RW menu consisted of  an appetizer, the meal, and dessert.  All for just $20.13.  Considering that this place normally serves well presented food and at a higher cost than average, $20.13 is a steal.  However, I actually was one of the fools that didn't order off the RW menu and got their Fish Sandwich, Poppy Fries, and Ice Cream.  The tilapia in the sandwich is fairly sized, flaky, and flavorful.  This was prepared like their Monkfish with a mix of dill and sauteed onions.  All of this was then caramelized and placed inside a bun. This was delicious and I still could imagine the taste while I type out this review.  Nothing really special about their fries, but complimented the sandwich perfectly.  For dessert, I got their Miso Ice Cream with Chips.  The ice cream was perfect immediately following a rich tasting fish sandwich. 

Now for the bonus of the afternoon...Angelo Sosa himself.  I overheard him saying to another Yelper that he only gets a chance to visit this restaurant one week out of the month. He went straight to our table, talked a little, and posed in a photo with us. According to the other Yelpers in our party, the food was extraordinaire today.  I wonder if it's because the boss was present.  Great dude that serves great food!!!  Hah..a rhyme every time.  

Shout Outs:  Another great time with other Yelpers.  Yelpers that I met for the first time today included Ife A, Kevin P, Regina P, Earl C, and Jade W.  It was nice meeting you all and look forward to our next event.  And I can't forget Christina W, Arvin C, Vanessa N, and Anthony M.  Another meal with good people.

Seriously, each restaurant at the Wynn has very similar fare for a very similar price, at least when it comes to lunch, and never does it disappoint. Each meal will run from $15-$25 on average and is very filling. Service is always on point and most places have outdoor seating available, perfect for a spring day. 

I had the chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato waffle fries. The chicken sandwich was exceptionally cooked, perfectly paired with some creamy slaw. The waffle fries were good but not great. I wish the sandwich came with a side instead of having to order the fries a la cartel but it is what it is. I highly recommend the sandwich if you come to Jardin. The salad, especially with added salmon, also looked very good from what I saw at tables around me. 

Overall I liked my meal here and would recommend it for atmosphere alone if you get an outdoor seating area. My one huge complaint is the reservation process. I first tried OpenTable and it said they were booked from 10am-2pm. I then called Wynn reservations and same thing. As I showed up at noon, I found that the place was only about a third full. I just don't get how there were no reservations available if it was two thirds open at the restaurant. Jardin needs to fix this issue as I want people to give it a try and not get nervous about having a wait or not getting a table at all.",2017-04-26 04:22:00

So, I've been a member here on and off since I was 8 years old. And this club has transformed before my very eyes over that time span. Normally, you would only find me on the tennis courts rather than in the sports club, but it wasn't too bad of a place. 

With the renovations that took place a few years back, a lot had been added and taken away. Like those yummy fruit smoothies that I use to charge to my club card with no remorse, and deal with the consequences of my father receiving the bill later on in the month. Something about losing their food license or some junk... But this building has many classrooms for anything from aerobics to tai chi, spa rooms for great massages and various treatments, racquetball courts, and numerous weight and exercise machines. Plus, if you have kiddies, there's child care provided as well. And of course, there's the tennis courts, the kiddie and lap pool to the south of the club.

I sometimes found myself on the 'golfer' side, for a quick bite at the lounge/bar after hitting the courts pretty hard or in their main dining area for weddings and their receptions held by numerous family friends. It really is a nice venue, they have a patio that overlooks the first hole and a nice courtyard with a small lake with a fountain nearby. Plus the food isn't bad, I always talk about how I dislike chicken, but for some reason they're chicken fingers at the lounge hit the spot every time!

Now to explain my rating...I knocked off a star due to the recent firing of a good majority of the tennis pro instructors that were great, and basically made tennis happen at this country club. I know how the economy is, but seriously, they didn't have to do it the way they did, apparently micro-management of the sports club needs some revamping...",2009-06-20 20:11:04

I placed my order, then 30 mins later the waitress comes back telling me that half the items i ordered aren't available. I of course was disappointed as to why she hadn't told us 25 mins ago. So we go ahead and order other items to curb our now famished selves. She comes back 10 mins later saying said items aren't available either. Our patience being tested, we order again another item. She comes back 5 mins later saying it isn't available. I really thought i was being pranked. We basically ordered 3-4 times and waited about an hour for anything to arrive at our table.

The food failed to impress. Big time. It was cold and bland. I only liked the beans.

The only reason i didn't walk out is because i was famished and really craving Mexican. Being in chinatown i didn't wanna trek to the plateau. 

To top it all... our waitress ends her shift and leaves nonchalantly without saying a word to us. I was F L O O R E D. We were left without a waitress and had to get up and chase down a bus boy for our bill. 


I hope the owners read this. Service is everything guys!! Hire proper wait staff, train them. If you have no food to serve, then close down and go buy food. You are a restaurant! People expect food.

I couldn't get a reservation in advance and we were lucky enough that there was outdoor seating on a relatively mild November night. Otherwise, I wouldn't even be writing this review.

I admit, once we got our food we understood why this place was so freaking busy. I came with a group of four in total, and we ordered a variety of tacos and appetizers to split. Nothing disappointed. Everything that came to us was fresh, crisp, tangy...whatever word you'd expect each ingredient to be, that ingredient met expectations and then some. And the flavor combinations of everything resulted in delectable dishes all around.

We kicked off our meal with their tasty bravas and cocktails, all of which put us in a very good mood - the kind of good mood that the best food inspires. And when the tacos themselves arrived they did not last long at all. The baja fish tacos stand out in my mind as the tastiest item of the night, almost making me regret ordering my mushroom tacos for the night. Almost - the mushroom tacos here are not to be underestimated, as a well-cooked mushroom is a mighty force. I think someone actually tried and loved the octopus tacos, which I skipped entirely. That food is not for me. But based on the way vegetables and fish alike were prepared, no matter what they make these cooks know how to make it right.

We ended the night by ordering a round of drinks for the staff after work - yep, this is an option that you have added to your bill, so when you visit, budget accordingly so you can spoil the cooks. They really truly deserve it.

Needless to say, my gang loved this place - we loved how easy it was to share dishes, and we loved the fact that the dishes were so good that we had a hard time even sharing them. I definitely recommend coming here when the weather is nice and asking to sit outside - while waiting to grab seats I saw the interior of täkō, and it was too dark and too loud for my taste. Maybe it's not usually like that? But if it is, I'd much rather eat here after rush hour. Tacos and cocktails on the sidewalk...sounds like a great night out to me!",2016-12-30 20:07:25

Not only did they scrape and prep for an entire day, but they cleaned up all of the paint chips and carted everything away.

Came back at 430 and the check in line was looong! We waited and since nothing was signed we had to wait to actually get a room assigened to us.  When we got to our room I was happy. The rooms are updated and spacious and wouldn't mind staying there for a night or 2 again.  My only complaint are the elevator wait times...they took forever and after a long day of walking around you don't want to wait in a crowded lobby just for an elevator to get there.  I liked the food court and other food options as they had Mcdonalds, Subway, and Zabbas.  They also had a sushi Restaraunt and Hash House (which seemed to have a long wait Sun morning, but that's expected) my only other tip is check to make sure you don't need anything from the gift shop that you may have forgot to pack because it does close...I believe I went around 1230a and they were closed.

So I decided to give this place a try after my first time.  It's under new management.  I really liked it! Still AYCE and seafood is part of it! You still have to make your own sauces but they have some pre-made ones that worked for me this time.  The beef and crab legs were my fav.  Def a must try.  The price for dinner is $19 and you get 3 appetizers included.  No 5 stars cause it took about 5 min for someone to notice us standing at the door and forever to get the check.  


I think the dipping sauce is important to enjoy shabu. The meat and veggies aren't marinated so the broth and sauce is where you get the flavor. With that said, this place didn't have any good sauces. There was an assortment but nothing like the ponzu or peanut sauce you normally get. Additionally, we couldn't build our own sauce..no garlic, raddish, green onions, chili oil , pepper, nothing.... And they have their meat pre cut and stored in the fridge that you can help yourself too. No freshly cuts meat. the experience was different but not enough to get me back in those doors.

First I will say the location is great as it is in a relatively quiet area right across from Frick Park. Outdoor seating is also pretty nice although today it was too hot to be outside.

Nonetheless, upon entering I requested outdoor seating and was then seated outside. The hostess didn't really smile or seem too friendly but she did grant me an outdoor seat. Initially I had to wait a bit for water and then kept waiting for someone to wait on me. One of the waiters then came out to stack plates on the other tables. Feeling hot, I requested to sit inside just before he obliged and led me to an indoor seat. Shortly after I was greeted by whom I think might have been a manager but not sure. He was far more accommodating and immediately took my order, which was the Haydari appetizer and for my entree the Lamb mixed grill.

The appetizer was pretty decent but the mixed grill really didn't stand out or wow me in anyway. The rice, while not terrible was not super great. I will say the marinade used for the lamb was pretty decent. I got filled up real quick and ended up packing most of it. Being that I always leave room for dessert, I ordered the Revani, which I felt was a very large portion but was too sweet.

The person who served me, who again seemed like he was a manager, was a genuinely nice guy and went out of his way to serve me including packing up all of my food all the while being friendly and engaging in small talk. Unfortunately, the meal just didn't do it for me especially for a price of $35 although the portions were large. Even after having left overs I just feel really bloated and not really blown away by the food. If I had to offer advice I would say the rice could be dryer and fluffier, and the dessert much less sweet. I feel doing that would make a significant difference.

We've tried their pumpkin pancakes (good texture, not too sweet), their breakfast burrito (nice contrast between the creamy egg, the veggies, and the toasted wrap) and a side of sage sausages (well seasoned). Generally speaking, their food quality is higher than Square Cafe for about the same price.

We did not have a long wait (around 11am on a Saturday), though it was not immediately evident how we get ourselves on the wait list. The service quality is a bit spotty, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I think it's because the waitstaff has to take care of too many tables, not because they are inherently rude.

It honestly looks like an empty room they put some slots and table in.  Very minimal décor.  Almost industrial looking or like it's a convention room with slots scattered about.

They did have some decent games that I didn't see elsewhere downtown or on the strip which is always nice, hence the 3 stars.

Believe it or not, i'd never been to the Mattress Factory before!  

So, having a day to myself, I decided to head over to see what all the fuss was about.  It's an unusual place to say the least, and it features room-sized exhibitions in an old building on Pittsburgh's North Side.  They offer lectures, tours, and they let people discover the connections between art and their everyday lives.  They even have rental spaces available for private parties, wedding receptions, and exhibitions.

The current exhibition is ""Inner and Outer Space.""  I'm not really into contemporary art, but it was fascinating to see the artists use all types of media including painting and video.  One peice I did like was ""Instant Before Incident"" and the artist created a sculpture of a 1908 Fiat, moments before an impact.  Another peice used mannequins and polka dots, and to me it looked like mannequins at a Twister game!

It's reasonably priced at $10.00 to get in for adults.  But, CMU students get in free all year, whereas Pitt students get in free only during fall & spring semesters.  Hmm, I'm a Pitt grad, so it loses a star for that!",2008-10-18 03:37:48

WnZPvTYrRA8vScneAWk0Wg,51munej7rdZuB7KfPofhaA,XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,1,5,3,1,"From the early 1600's & on, my family originated in Luckovice, Bohemia... so we are no strangers to good old fashioned traditional made from scratch home cooked Hungarian meals. Even when my grandfather came here to the US, the women in my family continued to make, grow and utilize everything themselves. So since the passing of all of my extended relatives, my father hasn't eaten Csirke Paprikás   since his mother passed away because no one makes it like mom. My sister was really excited to take us here for Father's Day this year and we all had very high expectations for the food in hopes that my father would finally break his anti Paprikas streak. Our experience was so terrible I was overwhelmed with disappointment & truly find the experience to be saddening. It's not that the food was bad, although it wasn't like my grandmothers (traditional Csirke Paprikás is made with a sour cream sauce not a gravy with a dollop of sour cream) but the unforgettable customer service - there are no words. 
   We had planned on having a party of six & had made reservations, upon walking in your are taken away by the beauty of the woodwork & furniture. What you're not taken away by is a hostess or even a server. We stood there waiting, and waiting and.... and even though we were definitely  seen we were not seated. My mother got annoyed and we all moved towards a large counter were we continued to be ignored as server after server walked past. Once we were finally seated it literally took 30 minutes just to get three drinks and an additional 30 minutes to get additional drinks when the rest of my family arrived. 
  My husband had become very ill with the flu & couldn't make it, so I had placed a take out order at the same time my original order was placed. My soup never arrived with my meal but my Lapcsánka's were so huge that I didn't have room for it. I thought that maybe our non vocal and practically non existent waitress had misunderstood me and placed the soup with my carry out order & thought nothing of it. During the entire meal, our very short blond haired rude waitress NEVER came back to our table, once! She never checked to see if we received our food, if it was okay, for refills, etc... nothing! The only nice employee there was an older gentleman who was busing tables  who we flagged down after waiting over another 20 minutes for our check. And, of course, I was charged for the soup I never got...this is when the evening went even further downhill. 

   Since it was our first visit & our waitress said not one word, I didn't know if she would come back & take my payment or if there was a register somewhere so I stood at the servers counter and waited an additional 15 minutes before (whom I assume is the owner) finally spoke with me. He was crisp and clearly confused when I tried to explain that I was charged for the soup and kept disappearing into the kitchen and running around like a complete nut. Instead of offering to just get my f*cking soup so I could get the hell out of there he made the biggest deal about removing the $3.00 charge from my bill. I mean he REALLY went out of his was to be a complete *sshole!!!! He took his good 'ol time (over 20 minutes!) and then had the nerve to tell me he refused my method of payment (a debit/credit card) because it is a requirement that your bill must be $30.00 or more to use a card -WTF!!!! 
   First off, I could see a $5.00 requirement due to the rising cost of using a credit/debit machine but $30.00! I'm pretty sure this jerk was lying to me but I didn't feel I had much of a choice other than to leave without paying. Thankfully I had some tip money in my purse and was able to barrow additional money from my father but most people don't carry cash these days & even so- why isn't there a very clear sign directly on the door stating the outrageous pricing requirements!?! Then when I gave him the cash he took an additional 15 minutes to complete the transaction. 

  I will absolutely NEVER suggest or return to this awful place ever again unless its to punch the owner & waitress in the face!",2015-07-13 12:09:09

The weather is still fluctuating, wandering the outdoor mall with frozen treat in hand tends to be one of those simple joys in life. 

What is so special about these icy desserts? They are made with all natural and simple ingredients. When looking over the flavors, most pops listed five or six ingredients. The flavors on hand were Strawberries and Cream, Calamansi, Mango, Passion Fruit, Pink Guava, Raspberry, and Pina Colada. On the official website, there are more options, so a rotation must be implemented. 

A week of 50's-70's has made 85 degrees feel unbearable warm. Luckily, we entered through this area and spotted Sasapops. I got a Calamansi because it was one of my favorite flavor enhancers. A few trips to the Philippines taught me that you can squirt this tiny lime like fruit on almost anything and it was bound to be good. It had a concentrated punch to it.

I'm not sure that I can say anything that hasn't already been said.

THE FLOOR. I was cold, just gotten my phone stolen, and wanted some comfort and found more comfort ON THE FLOOR than on the couch bed.

We ordered room service--it's nice but it did take quite a bit and the food was middling. Goat cheese pizza though, that was bomb. Chips and salsa, hot wings--Applebee's quality with Donald's prices.

Salesman sold us on the Pebble Tech Finish as he said it was ""Bulletproof"" and the only real finish to use in the Arizona Sun and heat.  Even paid extra for this including 14 feet of rolled beam.  The 10 year warranty on this finish was also a plus.

We first noticed a crack in the finish on one of the steps back in December and called about a Warranty Repair.  There were also several small cracks in the Rolled Beam.  It took two weeks and several calls to actually speak to someone and for them to send a Tech out to see what was needed.  I then got a quote from them for $550 to complete the warranty repair below the waterline on the step - warranty only covered materials and not labor.  They explained that they needed to completely drain and refill the pool to complete the repairs and that's why the cost was so high.  I asked if then we could go ahead and repair the cracks in the Rolled Beam.  They would need to send a tech out again to quote the additional work.

Two weeks went by and no return calls.  Another two weeks and no return calls.  Finally I posted a review on Yelp and had a call back in half an hour.  A Manager promised that he would personally look into the problems and that I please remove the bad Yelp Review. A week later the Service Manager came to my house and reduced the price for the repair to $350.00 since I would pump down and refill the pool myself.  Also told me not to worry about the Rolled Beam since the cracks were very small and would be OK for a few more years.

Staff was friendly but somehow seemed amateurish to me, despite not doing anything particularly wrong, always just a step or two off, perhaps.  Nothing that ruined the experience in any way.

The food was great.  I had read a lot of Yelp reviews before going, so I knew what to expect in terms of serving size.  Menu is a bit confusing to read, as it's in Spanish, but I recognized some of the dishes from pics on Yelp.  

The white sangria was tasty, and we each got about 2 1/5 glass fulls out of the jug, so an economic choice.  The leek croquettes were surprisingly yummy (albeit boring to look at), I like the bacon wrapped dates a lot but I expected to so it wasn't surprising, and the crispy potatoes were good but nothing too remarkable.  We got the lobster paella at the server's suggestion (of which paella to get), and maybe he just says it because it's the most expensive.  The lobster chunks were really good, and the shrimp (although still shelled) were fresh and well cooked.  The chorizo was boring to me, and next time I think I'd get an all-seafood paella.

This was enough food for the 2 of us, and came to about $65/person without tip.  I think that's reasonable for a fun, special night out on King Street.

In some ways there's little praise that hasn't been heaped on the culinary wonders that lie in this hidden gem at the back of a business plaza off Sunset road just north of the 215 beltway.

My wife well knows my aversion to sandwiches for the evening meal, but the ""chipotle"" baguette gets a special pass into my tummy at every opportunity. The quality of everything - the chicken, the bread, the aioli could be straight out of a Michelin star restaurant and here you have a solidly sized, artisan sandwich available for little more than the uninspiring fare served up by Subway or Port of Subs.

On top of the sandwiches, of which there is a small but exciting selection, there's usually one or two intriguing (and always incredible) soups of the day, and a selection of cookies, pies, tarts, and quiches which mean that even at the thoroughly reasonable prices, I end up racking up quite a bill - but it's money I am glad to pay to fill my fridge with such delightful goodies.

The thing that prompted this extremely belated praise of Baguette Cafe was an article in Las Vegas Weekly about ""50 Must Eat Meals in Las Vegas"". As far as I'm concerned - no trip to Vegas is complete without one of Olivier's baguette creations, perhaps complimented with a generous slice of chocolate tart and washed down with artisan ginger ale.

Ordered : White fish ( wok stir fried with water chestnuts, sugar peas ) , Goose ""parts"" ( as in the stuff normal people don't eat ) , salt/pepper squid, pan fried noodles, rice.

One must be suspicious when the fish comes to you within 2 minutes of ordering it ( may have been 1 minute ) - their wok must have some serious heat because the food was pipping hot !  the fish was moist and tender but i thought there was too much corn starch in the sauce.

the squid - decent and great price ( $8 )  for the serving size.

The goose - not my thing, but  my girl was disappointed in the quality - way too much sauce.

the noodles - very dry, my girl kept saying - not fresh, not fresh, not fresh.  ok i get it, the noodles ain't fresh !!

My mom was visiting from the Bay Area with her boyfriend, so we took them to Thanksgiving dinner here. Our waiter, Michael, was shockingly rude. Maybe his dog just died, or he was pissed that he had to work on Thanksgiving, but he did not even introduce himself.  He seemed annoyed that we didn't want to order any drinks. He was short and brusque with us. I asked for a kids menu and he said we don't have one. That's it. When I called to make the reservation and even asked the hostess when we arrived, they said they would have something for the kids. After much prodding, he admitted that they could make a half order of anything on the menu. In the end, I got her a half order of steak and fries with ketchup which she enjoyed.

When my husband asked, how big is the dinner size? His response - ""dinner sized."" WOW. Just wow. This is how they train people at Bouchon? I'm dropping 4 bills for this???? Beyond rude and unpolished. 

Only after my mom's boyfriend chatted him up about the Bouchon in Yountville (which they frequent) and other dishes, did he seem to loosen up a bit.

Food: Thanksgiving Menu dinner
pork belly with red-wine braised cabbage and persimmon - amazing composition of flavors
turkey w/stuffing, pumpkin croquettes, cranberry-apple relish, gravy - this was just ok. The dark meat was good and serving large, but overall it was a bit dry, salty and the croquettes were overcooked.
creme brulee - this was tasty and creamy
bread pudding - served deconstructed. I'm glad he actually told us this as my mom ordered it anyway, but I was glad I didn't because I prefer traditional bread pudding. She thought is was excellent though.

Ambiance: Loud. It was very difficult to hear and hold a conversation. My throat was sore by the end of the night.

Location: this restaurant is hard to find and the entrance to get to the elevators to get there is awkwardly located near the check-in lobby.

We pulled into the parking lot and I thought I would just run in and see if they had a to go menu so we could look over a menu to see if we truly wanted to eat here. They didn't have one but the lady told me to take my time and look over one of their menus. 

Instead, I just went back to the car and told my hunny and son to come in. I mean we were here already, why not. 

They were pretty busy when we first got there, or so I thought.  Time would teach me very well that I was wrong in my assumption.

Glancing over the menus, they have a good selection of items. Mostly Korean with hint of Hawaiian items. What won me over is that they had American items for me to choose from for my son. 

I settled on the hot rock bi mi map and my hunny got a regular bi mi map and for an appetizer we order Mandu. The kiddo got fries.

While we were waiting on our Mandu we were served some boiled peanuts which were so good. Art kind of looked at them weird because he had never had them but once he tried one he couldn't stop eating them.

Next came our cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, sesame bean sprouts, and some kind of stir fried hot dog.

I am a HUGE KIMCHI FREAK. This stuff was amazing. Other than it needing more heat (for my taste) it was extremely flavorful and still crunchy. I basically inhaled Kimchi and kept eying a jar that they had filled in fridge with that stuff and wondered how much they would have sold that jar to me for. 

I concentrated on the kimchi for so long, I didn't realize that Art had ate almost all the mandu and bean sprouts. Mandu had come out sometime while  I was lost in heaven eating that kimchi.

I was pleasantly surprised with the mandu. I didn't know what to expect for the filling but it was a noodle, veggie mixture deep fried in a pot sticker wrapper. They were hot and crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. 

My hot rock bi mi map came out and you could just hear the sizzle and smell the rice getting slightly burnt and crunchy. They dressed my bi mi map once it arrived to the table and that was nice. 

Art's bi mi map came in a huge white bowl and looked almost better than mine but I knew that I had the crispy rice to look forward to. My egg was slightly under cooked so it could finish cooking in the hot rock. My mouth is literally salivating now just thinking about it. It had a nice combo of meat and veggies in it. I meant to take a picture of it but I couldn't stop eating it.

When they brought out my son's fries they were sure to tell me that they didn't put any salt on it. I thought this was very considerate. They even brought him an otter pop at the end of our meal.

I don't know if our bowls were too big or we filled our selves on kimchi, peanuts and beansprouts and mandu but we had to go take half of our bi mi maps to go.

This place was a big hit for me and the fact that it was a huge hit for my hunny says a lot too. He doesn't love Asian food as much as me, so this definitely says a lot. 

The only downfall to this place is that they are small and get crowded, I mean no seats available crowded FAST! At least they did the night we were there. 

We will definitely be back. There are no ifs ands or butts about this. I want to go back and try some of that fried fish and bulgolgi I was eying on other plates.",2012-11-19 00:04:59

It wasn't really worth going out of my way to go here, however I would like it better if it was a neighborhood joint for me.  I didn't feel like eating pizza so I had the wings and fries, and I didn't like the wings at all.  I asked them not to drown them in hot sauce when they asked me if i wanted the sauce on the chicken or on the side, and they ended up giving me a bare faint of sauce, which ruined the whole entree for me.  Wings need to be tossed in sauce the moment they come out of the fryer.  When I told the waitress the wings didn't really have sauce on them she brought me some on the side, and they still didn't taste like they should after they are tossed in sauce out of the fryer.  Yes I'm picky about wings.

Anyway, husband had a medium pepperoni and although a little greasy, was pretty good.  If this was a neighborhood place for us that delivered, this would be the best pizza ever, but being that we trekked from the Henderson area, we weren't thrilled with the meal overall.

There isn't a lot of seating (read: a handful of barstools), nor much room for standing, while you wait for your order. The bright woodsy decor reminds me a lot of similar chains like Tsujiri. 

My friend and I shared a tiny slice of the matcha ""cheesecake"" ($5.50 plus tax). Its texture was reminiscent of mousse (and strangely, shaving foam), rather than your regular, or even Japanese, cheesecake. The crust was quite good but a bit on the hard side. I later saw a tupperware chocked full of tiny slices (from a freezer, perhaps?) which may be the reason for the tough crust. The matcha flavour was quite good! Bitter and not too sweet.

I am Brazilian so I feel like if there is one place I can review fairly it is a Brazilian Steak House!
Unfortunately Charlotte area does not have many Brazilian restaurants but I am glad at least we have Chima to make me feel like home sometimes.
The place with no doubt is gorgeous and not casual at all. 
It is perfect for business meetings, Anniversaries, Birthdays ir any kind of special celebrations.
I have been to this place many time and the last one I went with my coworkers for our Christmas Party.
They have down and upstairs, I mainly dine downstairs but this time our reservation was upstairs.
As usual they had a salad bar with many options of salads, of course, cheese, olives, ham, salami, prosciutto (....) and my favorite, heart palms!
They also had a side bar with soup, rice, feijoada and farofa - two Brazilian popular dishes.
Being very honest when I go to this kind of place I go for the steak so I try not to eat to much of the other things. I normally grab salami, prosciutto, heart plans and cheese so I don't get too full before my steak.
They serve prior to the steak, cheese bread, fried polenta, gooey mashed potatoes, fried banana and some weird fried meat balls. I normally pass all of those but the cheese bread. 
They have a large variety of options when it comes to steak and they also have chicken, pork and lamb.
My favorites are the cow ribs that melt in your mouth the flank steak.
The cook the steak to perfection! I love my steak medium/rare and is so hard to find a place that delivers me the steak the way I want, but Chima with no doubt delivers one of the best steaks if not the best in Charlotte!
They have a flip card that when you want steak you turn it to orange Yes and when you want them to stop just turn it to black NO.
The waiters come to you every few minutes bringing different options of meat. 
I am not a drinking person but I know they have good cocktails and delicious fresh squeezed juices. If you like to try different drinks you should go for Capirinha, a traditional Brazilian drink very strong and unique!
Their desserts are okay but I don't think they are very Brazilian. 
The staff is wonderful and well trained, it is not a cheap place but it is worth what you pay since it is all you can eat style. 
If you are planning on going just call and check their availability and also dress code. They are normally packed and they have some rules in how you need to be dressed. 
If you like steak this is the place for you!",2017-12-22 14:36:42

I might have had it occasionally for lunch back when I was frequenting places in this area such as Ross J's and Chicken Shack, whose menus don't contain cheesesteak.

I had an errand to run in the vicinity, so I used the Yelp online ordering system to order ahead, courtesy of something called Eat24 that I'm not too familiar with. It's pretty cool - easy to specify what you want, make any special requests, select what time (5-minute intervals) you want it to be ready, and even leave a tip if you'd like.

I had selected a 12:00 pickup time but happened to get there 10 minutes early. Luckily, they were already getting it ready, so I had a small wait and was able to glance around. I guess they're Philadelphia Eagles fans, although I don't know if they'll air the non-nationally televised games. I do like the superheroes plastered all over the walls. I think my friend would like this place since he's a big fan of comic book characters (again, sad for lost opportunities).

So, the cheesesteak. I picked the super cheesesteak (onions, peppers, mushrooms for $7.95), which was actually not on the web site for some reason. I forgot about selecting a cheese, so they defaulted to provolone. It was pretty good! Tender meat throughout, pretty decent bread, just wish the filling wasn't so center-skewed so that I didn't have to start biting the ends off or else risk having empty bread at the end.

Given that it didn't pick up my tongue and slap the insides of my mouth with it, I wouldn't say it's a sandwich that's a must-try in the Vegas/Henderson area. But it's definitely a should-try if you're a local or passing nearby, and it beats the _cheesesteak_ at Capriotti's handily (maybe not the other sandwiches). I approve.",2014-03-01 20:56:49

777 roll, $6. Spicy soft shell crab inside, with spicy tuna outside topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. Gotta say I was expecting more like a spider roll as far as texture. Couldn't really tell it was soft shell crab. And with all the ""spicy"" in the description, it wasn't that spicy. 3/5

It's got that ""clubhouse"" atmosphere with the Christmas Story lamp and Parker Bros Games. So about the 3rd time I'm there, I go into the bathroom and come out to a bar of shirtless people , thinking WTF? O, a shirtless shot! No, No thank you, I'm fine WITH my shirt. I'm a big boy and I'm sure no one wants to see my Buddha belly and Dungeons and Dragons tattoo anyway. They have a kitchen that stays open late and has some great wings. Cajun on the grill, mmmmm mm, try them. Chris, Krista and Nate are some good tenders, ready to serve. I usually stop there after going to the Timeout, on my way home.
Besides the Frat Boy atmosphere, my only beef is: one time I was shooting pool and the waitress somehow got about 8 shots on my tab, in addition to the 5 beers that I did actually have. Getting the mistake fixed was as simple as getting scolded by the head bartender about being clear about what drinks go on my tab, umm I only had beer, sorry. lol?

to recover from yesterday's

now I feel even worse.

I don't get it if you don't like your job why are you there? Why do they allow someone like her to be there when she is not representing the store as a friendly place to shop at! I felt like telling her to SMILE once in awhile!

After only eating a protein bar and subway all day my husband and I were STARVING so we decided to go ahead and use the groupon.  They say hunger is the BEST sauce.

We ordered the Thai Calamari & the Crab Dip.  The calamari was ok.  I was actually really surprised because it had rave reviews on yelp. It was not as crispy as I like for Calamari to be.  The crab dip was really good, we devoured that really quickly.

Our next course was a Caesar salad that we spilt.  The salad was really good.  The homemade croutons were on point and there was the perfect amount of dressing on the salad.

Next up was the New York strip entrees.  LET ME TELLLL YOUUU!!! The absolute best steak I have ever tried.  I mean EVER!  It was soooo good.   The flavoring was perfect.  It was cooked perfect.

We had excellent service.  Our waiter even brought wine samples out to our table to have with our entrees. 

The fries were delicious.  My steak and fries were both huge portions.  I could only eat about half of the steak and fries.  My husband on the other hand ate all of his steak and took the rest of mine home.

For dessert we split the Mom's apple pie.  It was ok.  I wouldn't order it again.

1. The outdoor area and indoor area is phenomenal. From the cozy booth seating to the warm communal tables, both exude true ""coolness."" If you want to watch a game, great. If you want to have good conversation you're able to do so.

2.  Lots of great beer options if you're into that thing. But I can't drink it. And you only offer one, very mediocre, blanco tequila for me to drink. like, WOOF. You pride yourself on such quality beers AND a great menu, but ave a SOLID full bar, too. who is behind your cocktail menu? I opt for wine, which is also sub-par offerings. Just disappointing.

3. The food is inventive with amazing flavors. I really appreciate the gluten-friendly menu. I wish the cheese board was larger, and we'd be happy to pay more. For brunch, however, don't tell me that i can't get egg whites. If you have real eggs, you have egg whites. Any line-cook should be able to separate the yolk from the egg in about two seconds. The hash was AMAZING but I don't like egg yolks. J had the chicken and biscuit and it looked amazing. Bacon was great, too!

Seriously, their dessert is so fattening and it'll get you full. It can replace your lunch, if you don't have heavy lunches or if you don't eat a lot in general. 

They'll serve you some fruits with chocolate fondue no matter what you order, kind of like how restaurants serve you bread and butter at the beginning. 

I got Fondue Triple Chocolat; a tall mug of really thick chocolate (swirl of dark, milk and white), 6 small pieces of decadent brownies, and a variety of fruits. To be honest, if I knew they'd be giving us complimentary fruits and fondue, I'd have ordered something different.....What I ordered was just like, a heavier and expensive extension of the complimentary stuff they gave.
Unless you LOVE fondue, order something different from what they're giving you already (basically, I don't recommend ordering fondue).

My friend got one of their breakfast meals for lunch, and he was very happy with it at the beginning, but later he got sick of eating it, because it's a looot of meat...ham, sausage, egg, bacon... nothing refreshing or light about it. Didn't have any veg or fruits. 

Great date place, good tourist experience. I wouldn't come back here again though...It's a little tooooo decadent (to be honest, after I had their complimentary stuff, I had had enough chocolate), and I'm not rich enough to keep coming back every time I want something sweet.

You get to choose between a bowl or sushi burrito. I'm not a fan of poke bowls with all the filler stuff in it so I ended up going to the sushi burrito. You get your choice of protein, toppings, delicious sauces, and other veggies to go with your protein. 

I went with the ahi tuna and salmon as my main protein. They were out of seaweed wrapper so I got the soy paper which was actually not bad at all. The only thing with the soy paper is that it rips very easily and becomes very soggy if you put a lot of sauce. The server was smart enough to add the sauce at the end because he knew what soggy mess my burrito would have been since I like a lot of ponzu sauce lol. You also get more topping choices of spicy tuna, crab and I can't remember the other one. Of course I got spicy tuna because I wanted more fish :P 

Then you have choice of greens to put inside the burrito and I went with kale. Then you move over to the little toppings like crispy tempura crumbs, onions, peppers and all that jazz. I wanted to try more sauces but since my soy paper would not allow this I had to refrain :(

I thought the portion was pretty good and the amount of fish they put it in was more than a lot of the other sushi burrito places I've been too. The workers were really nice and there's a good amount of seating inside.",2017-01-07 03:09:26

I love the feel of the place as you walk in the door. Cozy and yummy colors. It's nice that they used an existing building. Would of been cool if they had used the first proposed name- The Vault. I just love the whole place...until you walk to the back. I understand why they are calling it a PATIO or OUTDOOR SEATING, but I'm not feeling it. It's cold, dark, gray, and not the same loveliness as the original Vig patio. Both times I have been here, it's been with friends and they were already sitting in this back area. That is what I am calling it from now on, by the way, the back area. My smoker friends appreciate the fact they can go out the back door to slowly kill themselves, but they've also almost been hit by the Valet guys pulling cars around. 

I need to go in the sunniest part of the day and enjoy those big windows when they are doing their thing best. 

The food is, of course, the same quality as the other Vig and you can always count on getting a yummy, if not slightly overpriced dish. 

Kudos to James, the server. He handled our large group well and was prompt and friendly. 

Overall, I am very excited to have this Vig in my hood, within bike riding range no less. I'm sure they are still getting some kinks worked out and they could use to add a few more light bulbs in the 'back area'.

I've lived around the corner from Harvey's for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.  

While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I don't mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  There's a difference!

Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harvey's.

YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!  

Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ!

June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!!
Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home!

And at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of ""rodeo"" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up!
Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname.

Massachusetts Clams, tasted great... lightly breaded and great aioli dipping sauce.

I came here first back in 2000 when Lupo and Mandalay Bay was new. I was on my last night in Vegas from a week of trade show (NAB) and had just a bit of time before heading back to the airport. Saw the place just has you enter the Mandalay from the parking lot and asked if I could eat a full meal in less than an hour since I had a plane to catch. I was promptly given a table and the waiter took my order diligently. I was able to enjoy a glass of sweet vermouth while waiting for my meal. Everything was quite good from the antipasto, the pasta plate and the tiramisu... all in less than an hour.

Been quite happy with the result, Lupo became my tradition for my last night at NAB (National Association of Broadcasters convention) every year since. The first time I was alone but the following years it became a group tradition and we came here with group as big as 10 people. Every time the experience has been great!

There are a number of things to love here: 

1. The flavors, carefully concepted combinations like chocolate smoke, maple bacon french toast, and yes, roasted garlic with grapes. Even going so far as to use cereal milk in the Cap'n Crunch flavor earns 5 stars from me because it shows an ownership who really cares about their flavor profiles. (My favorites? Chocolate smoke, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Cap'n Crunch, Maple Bacon, Pumpkin)

2. Serving sizes. The small is two scoops, mix and match. On my first visit, I thought it was kind of small but in retrospect it is the perfect size. Just enough to really enjoy your delightful dessert without feeling post-dessert ickiness. 

3. The owner, SynDee is just so gosh darn adorable, friendly and truly excited about her product. You tell and taste how much she cares about her ice cream in each bite.

UlheVs3a8z-hKF4nNwQDGQ,BI-nIs6O-ZwldOaeK6iKIw,gu0fcKEHR5fATemsBta-WA,3,0,0,0,"So this is the story: My friends and I always eat at Chiptole or Osmows or just very random restaurants by the University of Toronto. I really wanted to get them out of their three block radius and go somewhere different and exciting. I really enjoy Creole food, or any kind of cuisine that screams Louisiana. I tried out Nawlins during Winterlicious 2016 and this Summerlicious, I really wanted MORE Cajun.  I scoured through the menus and found, in my opinion, the best one: Southern Accent. Their Summerlicious menu looked really promising and as a super eater of blackened fish, I wanted their blackened fish. They also had gumbo and jambalaya and I thought my friends would enjoy this kind of food.  

Little did I know that Southern Accent is extremely intimate. When we walked in, I think we all paused a little bit because of how romantic Southern Accent was. There was live music playing and the whole restaurant was dim with fairy lights snaking all around the restaurant. This restaurant is quite small and cozy and we were all bumping into each other with our backpacks. When we were sitting down, our belongings were just clanking and crashing into each other. It was all kind of embarrassing but very funny at the same time. 

Note: This place would be great for a date.

Anyways, with that aside, we all had a really good time. The restaurant was PACKED and I like my restaurants packed. Our food, though, was just not the best.  

For appetizers, the three of us got the gumbo and one of us got the Chilled Summer Tomato Beet soup, which is apparently vegan although it doesn't say so on the Summerlicious menu. Gumbo was good, but very salty in my opinion. I don't know what everyone else thought, but my friend liked his soup. Overall, appetizers was more or less successful. 

For entrees, we all got different things: blackened fish, ribs, jambalaya, dirty rice with tofu (vegetarian). My fish was alright, it wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be. The skin wasn't really crispy as what blackened would suggest. The rice was good though. My friend said his jambalaya was tasty, though his stomach is a black hole and didn't get full. My BF's dirty rice with tofu was super bland. It really lacked any flavor at all and this was a major disappointment to me and him. Maybe they could have seasoned his dish with the same fervor they seasoned my gumbo. But my other friend loved his ribs. So overall? Meh. I can't believe the vegetarian rice was so bland. Creole food is all about big and bold flavors and spices everywhere. 

The dessert was alright. Three of us got the brownie and one of the got the root beer float. I think I was just disappointed with the dirty rice to really enjoy the ice cream. 

Overall, I was super disappointed with the incredibly bland dirty rice. But, if you're looking to just go for a cozy and intimate dinner, then Southern Accent is probably for you. 

TLDR: Bring your date here. Just for the ambiance though, not the food.",2017-07-14 17:48:12

For the longest time, I honestly hated Chipotle and couldn't put my finger on what it was that I disliked. Then I finally hit the nail on the head. Its the meat! I have tried all of their meats and all have sucked honestly. The steak and chicken are tough, don't have much flavor, and tend to have pieces with grissle. Barbeqoa is wayyy too fricken salty. Carnita's are probably the lesser of the evils but is wayyyyy to peppery. If it weren't for the hubby being a huge fan of the carnita's and guac here, I would have never gone back. But since he loves Chipotle so much and requests it once a month, I had to find something to order that is decent. 
After trying tacos, salads, quesadillas, my go to meal turned out to be the vegi burro. Please don't give this review that look. Its actually good and it comes with the guacamole! Yes, I love meat and rarely order something vegetarian. However, Chipotle is the one place I prefer something vegetarian over something with meat because like I said, the meat is soooo horrible. Now when I am forced to go to Chipotle, I get a burrito with rice (I order extra), black beans, corn salsa, hot salsa, pico de gallo, extra sour cream, and guac on the side. These are the best items Chipotle has. I have to admit, their rice is actually tasty, their tortillas are soft and huge, the corn salsa is downright delicious (but who doesnt like corn), and their pico is always fresh with a pretty good flavor. Betcha noticed that I make no mention of cheese huh? Don't get me wrong, I love cheese but Chipotles cheese seems too strong for my taste. Anyways, let me sum up the food by saying that although you get alot, nothing accept the veggie burro is acceptable in my book. Even this vegi burrito is simply ok and tolerable, once in a decade craveable. 
Now as for the service, some of the locations seem to hire people that lack intelligence and this location is no exception to that. Many times, there seems to be too many people behind the counter running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Also, the burritos tend to have holes in them because the roller doesn't know how to roll. 
I will say that I am absolutely puzzled as to why Chipotle has such a huge following. To me, its far from being sensational. Luckily, I have found something decent to order but this is not a place that I get really excited about. About the only time I got stoked to see a Chipotle was in NY after eating multiple overpriced downright depressing meals. Maybe I was just looking for something familiar after being away from home for a week. However, when other Chipotle cravings emerge, I satisfy them and then head to the drug store to get a certain test because obviously somethin aint right!",2011-10-08 21:33:03

I have wanted to dine here for quite awhile, and heard that they have great Happy Hour.  So on a Sunday night, before my bowling league, I decided to stop in for some dinner.

It was pretty busy (around 5pm), but the hostess was able to seat me at the sushi bar.  I was approached immediately by a very nice server and ordered an Asahi Draught (only $2!).  I also mentioned to her that I am not a very experienced sushi eater and she offered suggestions for me.  Although I was more than ready to order some sushi, she kind of led me away from that....

I ended up starting with the chili garlic edamame ($3 I think?).  This was a large portion for one person, so definitely enough to share in the future.

I then ordered the Karaage chicken ($5) and teriyaki beef sliders ($4).  

While I was sitting there, enjoying my beer and Edamame, I saw the hostess following a gentleman who stopped by me at the bar.  I heard her telling him that she could not ask me to move - so he stood there, hovering over me.  It was extremely uncomfortable, and after a few minutes, he asked if I would be willing to move over 1 seat so that the 3 people in his party could sit there (again, awkward).  I know that this isn't the restaurant's fault, but it was weird.  I had food and drinks in front of me and I would just never ask someone to move while they are eating.

In the meantime, it took a long time for my small food order to come out.  I hadn't really noticed, but the waitress came to apologize and said that the kitchen was a bit backed up, trying to catch up on the last hour of HH.  No big deal, it came out a few minutes later.

I'll start with the sliders.  There were 2 in the order.  The meat was very dry, but overall they were tasty, especially for the price.

The karaage chicken was a HUGE disappointment.  I took 1 bite and almost threw up when it tasted (and looked like) it was raw inside.  The outside was very well done and crunchy, so I am not sure how this happened to the inside, but it was not appetizing.

My server seemed very busy and didn't ever come back to check on me.  A Manager came by awhile later to clear some plates next to me, and I told him he could also take mine.  He asked if I didn't enjoy the karaage chicken, but I didn't say anything.  I am not a complainer (although with something that could be a heatlh concern, I probably should have brought it up), and I was in a bit of a rush at this point.  I just told him that it was ""alright,"" and that I was just full.

When the server came around, I asked for my check.  She brought it back a few minutes later and mentioned that they removed the karaage chicken since I didn't like it.  I thought this was AWESOME.  I know that the chicken was only $5, and I didn't complain....but the manager recognized that most of it wasn't touched and removed it without me saying anything.  More restaurants should do this.

I gave my server the check, with my debit card immediately, but after about 10 minutes, she hadn't returned with it.  After awhile she saw me still sitting there and said ""they haven't brought your check back yet?!!"" Apparently someone else was running my card because she was busy, and they walked up right at that minute.  There doesn't seem to be very good communication with the staff - while sitting at the sushi bar, I heard many times that people had been waiting 30 minutes or more for sashimi.  Maybe they were just having a bad night altogether.

I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and 3 stars based off of how proactive the manager was, even without me saying anything.  All of the other reviews seem pretty decent, so it could have just been an off night.",2013-11-27 07:07:44

My salmon was ok. The sauce wasn't carmelized or anything, though it was supposed to be. It's soy based (or just all soy) so it's pretty salty. The vegetables were steamed and bland bland bland. They used a tiny cup to make the rice shape. Neither of us were full, just barely a step up from being hungry. 

Now what knocked the rating down further was that they were completely out of desserts. Our service was terse and brief. Also we were told at the end of our meal that the credit card machine wasn't working and if we had cash.

The second round I decided to go with the non-skin offerings (bbq pork, chicken feet and beef tendon[with curry powder, blech!!]). Not very impressive, though the chicken feet was quite good, jalapeno in the marinating sauce !?.

I'm definitely a fan of Korean food so I was happy to hear about a well rated Korean place I hadn't tried before. 

As far as lunch goes, this place is fairly cheap - It's a sit-down restaurant in which you order and pay first and they deliver it to you. The décor is simple and reasonable for a quick easy lunch, and the menu is short and to the point. I decided to go to for the bulgogi plate with soup, running $11.75. The Bulgogi plate was great for quantity - a good amount of bulgogi beef, seasoned flavoured rice, a salad, and glass noodles on the side. The soup I chose was spicy beef. 

The soup was pretty good and hit the spot for sure, but was nothing more special than a simple broth with a bit of beef and veggies (spicy). The bulgogi plate also had some pretty solid flavours, but nothing really stood out. The beef and rice were served a bit lukewarm, which wasn't inspiring, and the salad had too little dressing and was otherwise bland. Same story with the glass noodles - average flavor. 

However, one cannot expect a quick, simple, and cheap lunch place to blow your tastebuds away - and if we take into consideration the context as a quick, cheap, decent lunch, I 100% believe that this place stacks up better than many of your other options (think, food court, where you can easily spend $12). I'd definitely visit again for a work lunch or if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this on a weekend.

The menu is tasty, subtle and offers a variety of meat, fish and veggie options with rich sauces.

Let's start with the coffee since the restaurant does include ""Cafe"" in its title.  Cafe de Japon has gotten a lot of press in Las Vegas for its siphon coffee.  The brewing of siphon coffee is almost ceremonial.  It involves two glass chambers--the bottom one holding water that eventually boils and rises up into the coffee grounds in the upper glass chamber.  As it cools, the coffee separates from the grounds and falls back into the lower coffee chamber.  It's a hell of a lot of fun to watch, but as coffee, it's . . . decent.  I've heard people rave about it, but it's just a light roast cup of coffee.  It's smooth and lacks some of the bitter aftertaste of a traditionally brewed coffee, but it's merely a subtle, uncomplicated flavor. 

As for the appetizers, Cafe de Japon serves up an excellent agedashi tofu appetizer--square of tofu topped with flavoring in the form of grated ginger and scallions with sauce on the plate under the tofu.

We ordered the hamburg steak with daikon and vegetable rice curry.  The gravy sauce on the hamburg steak was surprisingly tart and reminded me of a German sauce, but much lighter.  The plate came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes.  Delicious and a wonderful combination with the steak.  The vegetable curry rice had a good spice, but more subtle than a Thai or Vietnamese curry.  The veggie curry did have an impressive, almost meat flavor to it.  But it's got a spicy kick, so be warned. 

Bottom line: 3 1/2 stars for tasty food and an extra star for very friendly customer service.",2012-03-13 03:43:26

However the fried chicken was still juicy, did not have too much batter and seasoned just right. The honey tabasco sauce was really good as well and added just a right amount of heat with some sweetness to balance the flavor out.

-Crispy Finger Dinner - Battered chicken fingers, Smoke Stack Fries, Tartar and Lemon - $18:

For $18 I received 4 pieces of chicken fingers and half basket of fries....The chicken pieces were fried to perfection and had good seasoning, but I think the star of the dish had to be the tartar!

For some reason we would always remember on a Sunday and unfortunately they are closed on Sundays. We went around 6:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other couple there so we were able to step in and order right away. We got everything to-go. I have to say I was a little disappointed in all the sides. The Mac & Cheese was dry and lacking flavor, the coleslaw was very ordinary, we ordered potato salad but ended up with another order of coleslaw instead. The corn bread was very good though, soft on the inside and perfect golden brown on the outside. My favorite thing we got was the brisket! Mmmmm... I could have eaten a few pounds of that fall apart, juicy, fatty goodness. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good, I liked the toasted soft bun. There were tons of homemade sauces to chose from. Each one of them had great flavor and one had a great kick of heat, I think my favorite was the mustard, it had a nice tang. So I would like to give this place another try.

Being lazy, and HAVING to watch FIFA, we ordered delivery. the food was a solid 'good', however, I know anything delivered, (especially fried) will suffer greatly. We had the plain schnitzel (no sauces, etc). Ordered beef and 1 chicken. It was good, but I am SURE it would've been sooo much better to eat in. Sides- potato salad, fries, spatzel, white coleslaw, beet salad. My bf didn't like the sides at all - I give the a pass (7outa 10). Based on previous review, we ordered potato salad, all a matter of taste, but I found it way too salty and way over dressed (to each his own).  Bottom line - I am sure the main event (schnitzel) is great if you dine in. It was still good for take out, don't expect it to be crispy - b/c that's impossible for take out (not their fault). I would recommend and encourage anyone to eat in. We, do still feel it was good and AMAZING value (cheap, in my books - double schnitzel for well under 20$! -- c'mon! :) ) Little tip - if you order take out/del and order fries - they're really good warmed up on a frying pan. 
What I love is they don't have an extensive menu~! They do schnitzel, and specialize it in!  IMHO I think they could do better on their sides and maybe offer a fresh salad on the menu. Totally worth going to. .. I'll update when/if we dine in",2014-06-15 16:39:57

When she told us that she opened a new restaurant in the East Beaver Creek area, we decided to check it out, not knowing what it is in the first place.

I didn't look at the reviews before I came here. Had I known about the weird setup, I probably wouldn't have commented as much on...well, it's weird setup. I personally found it more to be a karaoke bar than a club, since there was Chinese music blaring on the background of a TV screen.

We sat in the couch/sofa area. While I enjoyed its comfy feel, I highly suggest against sitting there if you're taller than 5'8"", as you would have to bend quite far to eat.

We ordered a combo for two, which came with cream corn soup, stir fried beef, lobster with cheese, and a side of veggies. We also added a beef shank in Szechuan style. Lamb skewers were also in our want-to-eat list, unfortunately they ran out that night. Eventually the manager gave us two free side dishes to compensate for the lack of lamb skewers.

Honestly, nothing really stood out. The cream corn soup was quite tasty, but everything else ranged from mediocre to average. The lobster was the smallest lobster I've ever seen, but I guess it's because it was meant to share for two people. I honestly wanted to try the lamb skewers though, but next time I guess...

After about 4 months, we have been waiting to come here.  I like the menu and their flexibility as well.

1. Pasta - The wife ordered the Gnocchi with meat sauce and she really liked it.  I liked it as well, as the Gnocchi was both firm and tender and the meat sauce was very tasty.  They serve a very nice full serving and she brought some home for leftovers, there was so muhc.

I tried the Fettuccini aglio e olio with vegetables and asked for Vegan style, since my daughter is vegan and I was gonna give her some leftovers.  This was a fantastic dish. The fettuccini is home made, al dente, and the mix of garlic and oil was just right.  I really enjoyed the simple taste.  The veggies were cooked perfectly and very tasty as well.  I did not leave as much for her as leftovers as I intended...

2.  The pizza - ordered a large Pizza Capricchiosa, mozzerella, tomato sauce, artichokes, olives, ham and mushroom.  This was an excellent pizza, the mix of ingredients were just right.  The pizza crust was fairly firm and i was able to grasp it with one hand, fold it and bite into it the way i like to eat pizza.  

3.  Caprese and Garlic Knots - We ordered the Insalata Caprese to start and the mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh, and mixed with oil and balsamic just the right way.  We enjoyed this very much.  The garlic knots were so fresh and so easy to eat.  I am afraid that if you don't control yourself, you will end up eating way too much.

We brought a lot of the food home, as we were really sampling what they had.  We also enjoyed their Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay.  The espresso coffee was also great.

Like most bubble tea places in Taiwan, there are many, many options to choose from, different kinds of tea (e.g. traditional milk tea made with black tea, tieguanying, jasmine, green tea...etc), different 'fillings' (bubbles, grass jelly...etc). If you want to add bubbles to a drink that doesn't have one it's an extra $0.50, which is pretty reasonable. The flavour of the place is really good -- one of the best I've had in Toronto for sure. I like that they also give you options for either a hot or cold drink, how much ice you want, and how sweet you want it. 
So, i'm giving it three stars for two reasons. One: It is just so ridiculously expensive for milk tea. In Taiwan, a basic milk tea goes for about a dollar, and 'fancy' ones go for less than $2. I know, i know, we're in Canada, but still, the basic ingredients are simple, it shouldn't cost an arm and a leg. I just can't bring myself to get this (again), despite how much i like it. 
Second: The person who was working behind the counter had trouble understanding the order.. as a result, out of the three drinks we ordered, two were wrong. I ordered a milk tea with bubbles and red bean and there was no red bean (i was so disappointed, especially for $4.50 a drink)! Another ordered no sugar, but there was sugar..

I usually don't order noodles at izakayas because they make me too full to eat all the other goodness that's being served, but at Kingyo I have to make an exception because my two fav dishes so far are the ramen(s) and the udon with sea urchin in it. And I don't even like sea urchin!!

I always go and get my brows waxed from time to time to get it back in shape. I tend to do the clean up myself but when I get lazy, the shape goes off the deep end. So it's always nice that this establishment is so close to home that I can just drop by after work one night and head on in! I like how that every time I've gone in, it never required an appointment. I don't like to set up appointments if I plan to go after work because if something got messed up at work, I'd end up staying over and then I'd probably miss my appointment. 

All three of my visits were good experiences! I actually really liked the last esthetician that I went to. I think her name was Christina -- she used to work for Benefit I think? Talking to her was very nice. We had some fun conversations about work. 

Best of all ... waxing your brows costs $8! It's probably the cheapest I've ever paid for getting my brows done. And sometimes they also hold raffles on their Facebook page so always keep yourself updated!

Now, I can have fun anywhere. I am not a nightlife snob, I even used to go to the club district for retro Sunday nights, back in the day. But most of the time when I end up here, it is for a specific reason (being taken there by a specific person), or because I have not wanted to venture very far from home (usually in the winter), since it's about a 5 minute walk from my house.

Our British cultural fascination is not what it once was, five years ago. Even when the Mod Club Theatre opened, it felt like it was kind of already over. Once Blow Up (remember? At Lee's Palace??) had its last hurrah, things didn't feel the same, and it's cuz they weren't. This has always seemed far more contrived than the other, and way less fun. However, I have the utmost love and respect for Mr. Mark Holmes, that I promise you. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Blonde_(band)

I remember strongly disliking: the go-go dancers on the stage, which I assumed were a part of perks I got with the ludicrous $15 dollar cover charge. I would have voted no, had they asked. 

Fun fact: 'twas after a trip here that I threw up for the first (and only) time, for alcohol-related reasons. Which seems about right. It also, incidentally, marks the last time I ever drank Smirnoff Ice. These things all seem to encapsulate the way I feel about this place.",2009-01-28 06:10:13

The customer service is approachable so talk about what you like. They will customize bowls to fit your taste. They have two sizes. I usually get the smaller size and feel full for my whole workday.

Don't know what an acai bowl is? Imagine eating a bowl of cereal full of chunks of fresh bananas and strawberries. Now imagine that instead of milk it's a berry smoothie. It's like eating dessert, but it's made with many healthy ingredients.

Body Builder- You'll hear customers ordering this acai bowl all day long. As a regular acai bowl eater I can really taste the peanut butter in this one. Relative to ones I've had these are creamy from the almond milk. Apple juice mellows out the acai too. Thank goodness they cut the toppings into bite-sized pieces. A generous amount of honey covers the top. The only thing this one is missing is fresh coconut flakes. These guys are so nice I bet they would put it on there for me. The bottom has the perfect amount of hemp granola.

Peanut Butter Lover- Naturally I had to try this pitaya bowl. Sure enough it has a strong peanut butter flavor. They were kind enough to let me try it with chopped almonds on top, which it usually doesn't and that made it even nuttier. The color of the pitaya is a startling pink, but it very mild and fruity. Don't be scared to try this one. Super good.

Sorry business owners, if you can't take candor from your patrons on a public forum, you're in the wrong business. A negative review hurts your business less than allowing the negative experience that spurned the review in the first place!

I came in around 3PM so it wasn't particularly busy. The restaurant design was tasteful and clean, just the way I like it. 

Since there weren't many customers at the time, I was waited on by two people. I had a variety of ban chan and my kalbi tang. Sometimes the service would overlap which could be a good and bad thing. I personally like eating without feeling that someone is watching my every move while devouring into my meal. 

So I've had kalbi tang in NY and LA and typically the beef would be stewed to the point that it would fall off the bone. Or there would be bones, but they would be chopped into pieces so it would be easy to eat. In this case, it was two large meat bones. I was terrified to try to eat this without looking like a cave person. Worse, I had come from a work meeting and was wearing a really nice dress today. I tried using my chopsticks to pick the meat off without much success. I had no choice. I picked up the bone and ate the meat off with my hands, it was very messy and stew splashed on me. So embarrassing. Of course I knew they were watching my every move and within minutes a server came by and placed some scissors on my table. I proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes hacking up my beef with my hands and the scissors. Again, very and messy.

I didn't take a picture, but noticed that there is one of the kalbi tang in the photos in the yelp page.

The quality of the stew was good, but the preparation of the kalbi tang was not. I told them that they should prepare the kalbi tang with the meat cut off, I mean the meat is one of the best parts oft he stew. I can never shake off the feelings of humiliation to return to this restaurant.

I give this place 3 stars because I know that they are new and have really good potential.",2015-10-21 13:45:49

My second time trying the infamous brew tea that every seems to be reviewing about. I can see why it's hitting all those red stars on yelp. They have a huge range of flavors from tea to slush to choose from. On the other side of the menu they serve crepes and all the other wonderful treats. 

I Order three drinks, served real quick considering there were probably 20 people cramped into one little tea shop. As soon as you walk in you can feel the atmosphere light up with friendly ongoing people having a good time with their friends and sipping on some bomb tea. There are a few tables and seats where you can chill and a small bench for you to wait for your drinks. 

I had the chance to try the mango slush, it's 30 degrees outside in Vegas right now. Delicious and the bubbles was delightful. Awesome would be the best description for the mango slush. No one can say it was awful, because I think it's near perfect. 

Secondly I order a crepe, very inexpensive. 3.50$ base plus ice cream 1.00$ and .50$ per topping. Nothing can really go wrong when your crepe is under $7 bucks. Praise the brew tea god for making a huge delicious crepe for so cheap. Topping that pairs with my mango slush, 10/10 a good time. 

I highly recommend anyone who hasn't tried brew tea to try this spot! First order your perfect crepe with extra Nutella and then try the slush or tea. Either is both great. You can not go wrong, trust me it's very delicious.",2016-12-27 05:01:11

I finally decided on the combination rice plate with shortrib and my dining companion opted for the steak and eggs. The food came out pretty quickly, although my dish came out a few minutes before my friends, which was a little annoying. The lobster pho looked good as they were serving it to a neighboring table, so that definitely piqued my interest for my next interest.

I enjoyed my shortribs and everything I tried was solid, just nothing amazing. Service was good but refills were a little hard to come by. I especially enjoyed the kim chee which was on the spicy side. That was my favorite thing about the meal.

Brunch on Sunday starts at 11 AM.  My companion and I decided to sit outdoors since it was a rare beautiful day of mid-November in Pittsburgh.  We started out with their smoked salmon appetizer and their Jamaican Jerk chicken wings.  For entrees I got the Kaya Benedict.

I ordered the smoked salmon b/c I like beginning my meals with some sort of cured meat, either a smoked salmon or some sort of antipasto.  The smoked salmon appetizer came out with a large serving of smoked salmon topped with minced onion, cilantro, a drizzle of creme fraiche and two fresh tortillas from Reyna's Foods right down the street.  We added the Jamaican Jerk chicken wings and it was definitely a good decision.  Typically chicken wings are fried and then tossed in a sauce.  These wings were super flavorful and crispy; I think they were marinated and then baked?  I'll ask next time I'm there.  The lime cilantro sauce was creamy and full of cilantro, but I would have liked a bit more lime for a little more zing.

The Kaya Benedict didn't meet my expectations at all.  It was cornbread with roast pork topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  The cornbread was sweet but it just didn't fit into the dish at all and clashed with the roast pork and the egg.  It's texture was soft and made the entire entree mushy...  The roast pork too... completely uninspiring.  It came with grilled pineapple, which was pretty good as well as their house hash brown, which was a plated as a weird mound with slight crustiness on the outside and mainly mush inside.  The spices of it just didn't click with me.

The Kaya burger though, is one of Kaya's saving graces (along with their happy hour).  I ordered it medium rare and it came topped with bacon, avacado, tomato, cheese, special sauce, and a sunny side up egg.  It comes with a side of chips, but you can substitute their side salad if you want.  Gourmet burgers are always interesting because the chef's choice in combination of toppings and the bun shows a representation of his/her cooking style.  As someone who views himself as a burger purist, I'm not too familiar with gourmet burgers in general, but the Kaya burger did impress me.

I'd probably just stick munching on some appetizers with drinks during their weekday happy hour from 5-7 PM.",2009-11-17 05:03:34

RQHnAF0m81NZk0rFdv6tYg,lNDoRrMrdrK-Gd8Yllgpkg,HGuHk935tyokX6kveEviJw,3,2,0,1,"Prologue:
My fiancée and I had previously dined here for Dim Sum on Sunday mornings and our experience was favorable. This time, however, we decided to try something different from their regular menu for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date.


The Plot:
The appetizers were all somewhat familiar, so we elected to skip that and begin with a few of their specialty entrees, including the Seafood Tofu Claypot, Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli, and Intestine with Sour Cabbage and Chili.


The Scene:
The portion size for all of the entrees was plenty for the two of us. All three dishes were also properly prepared, including the quality, texture, and consistency of the ingredients as well as the seasoning and the presentation.

The Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli was a variation on the traditional dish (usually with oyster sauce) that was new to both of us and which we enjoyed as much if not more. The salted fish flavor was bold but not overpowering, it nicely complimented the other dishes we ordered, and is something we would recommend trying to all Chinese broccoli fans.

The Seafood Tofu Claypot was quite traditional with good balance of flavor that went very well with the steamed rice. For me the tofu was perfectly cooked and was the centerpiece of this dish, as it should be, along with the usual assortment of seafood.

The star of this meal was most certainly the Intestine with Sour Cabbage and Chili, in part due to the fact that neither of us had previously tried anything quite like it. I'm a big fan of all types of cuisine featuring intestine and this dish was a real treat. The chili definitely delivered some heat, the sour cabbage added a surprising twist, it all worked well, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.


The Rest of the Story:
Service was slow; however it was a busy Saturday night, we arrived rather late in the evening, and the dishes we ordered were somewhat uncommon.
The Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli was a little misleading in that the broccoli was seasoned with salted fish rather than being served along with salted fish.
My fiancée said she found herself searching for shrimp in the Seafood Tofu Claypot and thought the seafood should have been more plentiful.


Epilogue:
Overall the food was very good, easily deserved 3 stars, and was an experience that I believe any fan of Chinese food would have enjoyed.
We elected to not award a fourth star because my fiancée thought the seafood in the claypot should have been more plentiful and that the dishes overall were a little pricey, especially the Chinese broccoli

I walked by Crazy Don multiple times and noticed they always had a very long line up. I was hoping to give it a try when they had a shorter queue. My friend and I happened to be around North York on Victoria's Day and was lucky enough that there was no one lining up. The store design was very modern and had a lot of wooden decor. 

--- Food and Drink ---

My friend and I ordered 2 dishes: 

1. Kimchi Cheese Cream Rice Cake (Chewy Rice Cake cooked with creamy Alfredo with mushroom, green onion, noodle, mozzarella and pan-fried Kimchi) $12.95

- This was one of the best Korean Rice Cakes I have ever tasted. I could smell the dish before it arrived. I saw the cheese bubbling on the hot sizzling pan. The rice cake cooked perfectly and was very soft and chewy. The cheese and creamy Alfredo sauce coated over the rice cake tasted like heaven. Even though I couldn't taste any mushroom and noodle in the dish, I still loved it a lot and would definitely reorder this dish. 

2. Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice + Spicy Pork Back Ribs Combo $19.95
- I loved how the fried rice was dry but flavorful. There was a generous amount of kimchi and bacon in the fried rice. Normally restaurants provide bacon bits, but Crazy Don cooked their fried rice with actual bacon pieces. The fried rice was also cooked with green onion and sweet corn and topped with a sunny side up egg with seaweed and sesame on top. 

- The pork back ribs were quite bland (perhaps the other dishes were too tasty and had a stronger taste). The texture of the ribs were very tender and I could bite the meat off the bone easily. It also came with 2 sides for this dish: a refreshing cucumber coleslaw and a macaroni salad. I personally liked the coleslaw more because it can clean up your palette. I found the macaroni salad too sweet. 

The restaurant also provided two appetizers, pickled cucumber and carrot and a cold miso soup. I wasn't too fond of their appetizers though. I liked hot soup more than cold soup. 

-- Overall --

I found their portion size bigger than I expected. We could not finish half of the dish. I enjoyed my visit here, I would definitely reorder the kimchi cheese cream rice cake. I won't suggest their pork back ribs because it tasted kind of bland. I would come back to Crazy Don to try other dishes for sure!",2016-05-25 01:29:59

I inquired online to make an appointment, and Shawn responded quickly to my plea for help. I explained the situation with my dad...his current ""style"" (if you can even call it that), his sizes, and my goal for our appointment. 

Shawn was better than I could have ever imagined. He was prepared and had items pulled for my dad to try on, he helped to explain to my dad how clothes should fit properly, and my dad felt very comfortable. Shawn was so much fun and so personable. Both my dad and I were laughing and having a blast. 

I could not have wished for our appointment to have gone better. Honestly it was amazing!!! My dad was so impressed with this amazing FREE service that nordstroms offers.

Also, every Friday night is bull riding.  This was, by far, my favorite part of the evening.  There were 3 rounds.  My friend rode on the 1st bull in the 1st round.  They randomly select which person will ride which bull.  Some people can't stay on, but others stayed on for the full 8 seconds.  It was really neat to watch!

Who knew the desert would have good sushi? I stumbled on this place while I was at a convention in Las Vegas. I was sick of hotel and fast food so I goggled the closest sushi place that was off the Strip. Makino was one of the first places that came up and it was at an outlet mall. Since I had time to kill, I decided to have lunch there then do some window shopping. For the price, quality, and variety this place is awesome. They have a wide range of sushi, sashimi, tempura, chicken teriyaki, seafood, & other popular Japanese dishes. If you are an AAA member, stop by the customer service stand and get a coupon book. You can get a free drink which is a 3 dollar savings. Keep in mind there is a 3 hour window to eat at Lunch and Dinner (this is to keep the sushi & sashimi fresh). There's also usually a Japanese tour group that comes thru, but it never affect any waits. This is definitely one of my favorite Japanese places. 

A little about my credentials:

I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.",2010-06-23 01:22:22

I used to live in a hole in the wall across the street from this coffee shop, I lived above the Jamba Juice on State Street.  As a broke college student, with no parents to live off of, and making $7 per hour, I wasn't a fan of Starbucks.  Both being students, this coffee shop was where hubs and I ""dated"" over textbooks and highlighters and mounds of rough drafts (we were too broke for those newfangled laptops).

But enough of the nostalgia, on to the review. 

Fair Trade was my first experience drinking Mocha, and I have been hooked ever since.  Considering my ""first time"" was here, it basically has set the standard as far as what I look for in coffee and fancy caffeinated drinks.  There is no bitterness to their Mochas, it is smooth and creamy and eyelid opening.  Just the way I like on a long night of studying.  

There are few comfy seats, mostly tables and chairs for the hardcore study sessions and writing papers, but position yourself at a table near the window and eye the cozy chairs like a shark, and you'll get yourself a seat in a good half hour, unless your competition is the student with the ginormous book bag who plans to hunker down. 

They have a decent deli selection also, their cheesecakes are a perfect coffee match.  Prices are affordable, and as a regular I was ""hooked up"" more than a few times with a discount and an eye wink.  

Just about all of State Street can have the heart fluttering effect on me when hubs and I make our returns to campus, but Fair Trade has a special place in my memories.",2011-02-24 15:13:34

This bar has a great rustic feel to it, and is so tucked away in the corner of the Kohl's complex that I didn't even know it existed until someone told me about it.  

I absolutely love their drink selections! If you are into IPAs and Stouts, this place will definitely satisfy your drinking needs. Their drink selection is displayed on a huge chalkboard in the back where it's beautifully color coordinated to show you their stouts, ales, IPAs, etc. oh they also have wines too if you're into that stuff. 

Overall the best thing was the service. The bartenders really are pretty chill! I went first with my wife and told the bartender that we'd be coming more often now, and the next time we came in, he actually remembered both our names! Pretty cool and pretty genuine. 

Also if you get a chance to munch on a little snack, they have amazing homemade grilled cheeses! I got the pesto and sundried tomato one, and it was awesome! We also got a meat and cheese board which was fun to share with friends, and when we ran out of crackers and still have a lot of meats and cheeses left, our bartender literally gave us a huge amount of extra crackers! Such nice service!

1) Try a grilled cheese sandwich but don't come starving. These are bite size sandwiches

Ok...great...if you would let me finish my sentence you would know I wasn't requesting a booth (I get y'all get packed and need the seats). Strike 1. 

Strike 2... the layout of the place is awful for a sushi buffet I mean people were crashing into each other trying to get around to the sushi or their respective tables. I'm sure they can figure out how to reorganize the interior to make it a bit more logical in terms of the layout. I found it very stressful to navigate around servers, staff, and guests. 

Strike 3...the sushi pretty much was awful. There were no labels telling you what type of fish was in each roll. Many of the rolls were deep fried and filled with cream cheese or covered in mayo. A few of the nigiri pieces were decent with seared tuna being an option at one point. Would it really be that hard to over some sushi that isn't deep fried or covered in mayo/cream cheese. Also, isn't it a health code violation to not label the food being served? Seems like a big risk to take given how litigious Americans are and the prevalence of food allergies. 

Skip Ru San's and go to Mr. Tokyo - you know exactly what you are getting, the staff is friendly, and you can skip the anxiety inducing procedure to get sushi as you order as you go.",2017-09-27 16:59:39

We went around 11:30 a.m. to eat lunch at Moe's Southwest Grill and Which Witch, and afterwards, we wanted to check out the shops. A little after noon, only a handful of shops were open and those were pretty much only the big name shops. Even shops that had signs indicated they should be open, weren't. I don't know anything about retail shopping centers but it seems that Westgate should regulate that. As a result of so many shops being closed, we were bored out of our minds.

The team here has a different feel to them.  Everyone was smiling, everyone came and introduced themselves and was just eager to please the customer.  I test drove a couple cars and after a couple days, I found what I was looking for.  When I finally closed the deal, I worked with JJ, who was quite possibly the best fit for someone to sell me a car.  Working with him didn't feel like I was talking to a car salesman, it felt like I was talking to a good buddy!  Overall, I worked with Adam in used sales who was incredibly uplifting, polite, and positive.  Manish, the sales manager who was also amazing.  Ruben, who worked tooth and nail with JJ to get me the right deal, JJ who sold me the car, and Michael in finance who took the time to go over everything with me in clear detail and made sure I understood everything 100%.  I won't say that every step of the way was a walk in the park.  There was definitely some negotiating and compromising that was done on both ends but this transaction had the best possible outcome that I could have imagined.  It was SO NICE to work with a team of fun loving professionals who really cared to get you what you, the customer, are happy with.

a friend and I decided to do lunch on a Friday afternoon and we went into this location at 12 o'clock exactly and it looked like it was really busy from the outside but we got seated right away

the server and hostess were very polite got us our drinks right away and then our waitress came she was super  friendly and helpful by showing us all the specials 

we decided on a appetizers fairly quickly because I had to be to work right after lunch. as soon as we got the chance and knew what we wanted we both ordered Alfredo mine was seafood and my friends was grilled chicken

we ordered the risotto bites for an appetizer they were a cheesy risotto ball and it was dipped in batter and deep fried with a homemade crushed tomatoe sauce and shredded cheese on top  one of our favorite things about Olive Garden is the endless soup salad and breadsticks and let me tell you what she kept it coming she kept offering us the freshly shredded cheese which is absolutely delicious and when I'm ready she brought us the amazing Alfredo even throughout the meal she refilled are breadsticks   we both had the spicy potato and sausage soup which is amazing as always very creamy very hearty  and it even has kale in it  my friends chicken alfredo was amazing a chicken with freshly grilled it was not dry it was very moist and juicy and handles were home made my seafood Alfredo the sea food was cooked perfectly it was nice and tender the alfredo sauce very creamy and buttery and rich and it was just full of flavors I could soak up with the breadsticks

she boxed up my leftovers and our leftover bread sticks and even gave us cups to go for drinks when we had it out so like I said the service was amazing the food was amazing the locations great 

the big issue that I have is when our bill came I paid with my credit card. our bill was under $40 and I gave her a7 dollar tip (in cash) well later on I noticed that not only do we have our lunch tab on my bank account I also had a almost $50 charge from Olive Garden that was subtracted from my account so I was missing 90 dollars out of my account for a 30 and some change meal! 

so I gave it 24 hours it was not back in my account so as soon as I got off work I called it down to the location from the number provided to me on my receipt when I call the manager on duty was Jake up Jacob did take a good look into the situation explain to me everything that happened and when I questioned why my card was ran twice he continued to dig deeper into the situation 

I was not letting him play it off as a server error because she was amazing then  I made him dig until he came to realize that my card was swiped for my table and somebody else's table! when I notified him that the extra charge on my account cause me to go over draft he then started to become apologetic.  

I have been in the restaurant industry and management for the restaurant industry for the past 5 years and this is something manager to manager that Jacob needs to learn apologizing to your blue in the face does nothing for customers you need to compensate them for the inconvenience that you caused them and expecially in this situation with the extreme inconvenience  

I didn't get offered a coupon for next time or a lunch on Olive Garden all I got was a we reverse the charge right away it should hit your account on Monday hopefully your bank will return the overdraft fee and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry  it's like he did not even care if I was going to ever return to his location or not  

I really do love Olive Garden and I love the convenience of the location its right next to my job it's really close to my home and it sucks that I don't want to go back because of the way I was treated because of an Issue they inconvenience me with. might go back to another location but I will probably never go back to this one",2014-02-02 07:56:32

We bought our tickets online through Fandango to watch Michael Moore's new movie: Where to Invade Next. Since this is a documentary and Indie film it was only playing at this theater and location.
We were not disappointed as the entire process of using one of their machine's to print our tickets, to going over the huge and expansive snack bar with a large selection of movie candy, sodas and popcorn as well as hotdogs, etc. unfolded before us. T
The employees were helpful and friendly. They also have a bar if one would like to drink an alcoholic beverage.
There is an area to add movie butter, seasonings, straws and napkins. We were directed on which theater go to for the movie. (We selected our seats on Fandango as well). 
Inside the theater were nice electric leather recliners. They are equipped with drink holders to hold the drinks. There is a button on the inside of the right arm rest that operates the recliner to any position of reclining I wanted. The chair was very comfortable and the screen was expansive and clear. The picture was sharp and of high, digital quality.
There was only one other small group in this theater as it was at 10:45 pm so it made the experience more private and enjoyable. 
This is a very modern, clean, and upscale venue. We will return to this location at some point in the future as we had a good experience.",2016-03-23 04:58:50

It was super clean and well decorated although quite simple.  The staff were very friendly and we were seated right quickly.  The food smelled amazing and I began salivating as soon as I sat down.  I ordered the Drunken pork noodles and my mother got the beef pad thai, both of which were very tasty.  I got mine with a 6/10 spiciness and that was just right although when I go back (because I definitely will) I will order a 7/10.

Friend says's he heard that Pasta Bar was good so let's try that. I said, yeah, there are 3 restaurants there, a Irish Pub (Turf) a Thai restaurant (Sens) and Pasta Bar. I said ""Larry likes Thai""...Phil said, ""Phil likes Italian"" and that was the fateful decision.

I knew I was in trouble when we entered the restaurant and first, there was not a ""sense of entry"" nor anyone to greet us other than the strong smell of newly painted walls. Bartender said ""sit where you like"". 

Two of us had the lunch special (about $12) and friend who suggested Pasta Bar ordered from the menu. His pasta was $15. Lunch special came with a drink. I will say, the pasta was very tasty, the salad had very good thought and fresh locally grown produce. Salad and pasta lunch special was served on the same plate which to  me was unappetizing. Lunch came with a very thin slice of bread. Bread was excellent but no butter. Server/bartender was made aware and out came a the smallest portion of butter I have ever been served and to be shared with all three of us. There was enough to cover half a Triscut wafer! Pasta was fresh, but without any meat. 

The atmosphere is dark and we were told that it was to be an Italian diner. What added to the dark side was the art work. Andy Warhol images of Jim Jones, Rasputin, Christopher McVey and other icons of evil. The headache lingered on all day after I paid the bill for $52 for lunch.

The reception area is very nicely decorated. However service was very lacking. I guess it was my mistake to go here on restaurant week when everything is fully booked and expect good service.

To clarify I did not actually participate in the restaurant week special, though the experience left me wishing I had because none of the gauchos actually check your token to see if you bought the full experience or not. A nice surprise for half of my table as they got a great deal. Though those who paid full price can't help but ask why did they bother?

Our waiter greeted us nicely, took drink orders in quite a timely manner and explained the ins and outs of the concept. Quite a nice guy though obviously in a rush as they were understandably packed. Left to our own devices we wandered over to the nicely appointed salad bar.

All of the items on the salad bar were nicely stocked despite the crowd and my selections made me quite happy. The corn flan was quite the standout for me with it's luscious and creamy texture with the slight sweetness of the corn. Though probably not a good start to a already heavy meal but still my favorite. This would work great as a dessert with a berry coulis or something.

Onto the main entrees. The little appetizers they brought out were quite delicious though I find it hard to recall any of them except the fried plantains. Meats were quite varied and for the most part nicely cooked. Fish on the other hand was mostly overcooked for me and quite tasteless compared to the well seasoned meats. What's up with that?

Moving towards dessert which is an extra charge onto the meal. They were reasonably priced and all were satisfactory. The cheesecake was quite a standout with a soft creamy finish and not too sweet or grainy at all. Though a lot of us couldn't take more than a few bites of our dessert and I wish they would have offered a togo container or something instead of just taking it away after a while. Such a waste of food and maybe we could have finished them in the time it took while waiting for our checks. Which brings me to my first paragraph's  criticism!

The service was super slow. One of our group joked while waiting for the check that we spent most of the meal waiting. This might have not been a joke now that I think about it.

The next day there is BLOOD in my stool. I research all my symptoms and it's all matching up with E. Coli. My mother in law didn't feel sick at all, but me and my husband are both feeling crummy, and I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth (and gurgling in my stomach) from one of my favorite places.

For as long as this place has been in the area there is nothing exciting about it any more. They have offered the same menu for years with really NO direction for innovation. No chili by now? No additional unique toppings? No more creative uses to the current menu? I'm over it. You could possibly get the most out of this place if you waited a long time and decided to eat there. 

Avoid getting your burgers/fries to go, even if you live right down the street. Burgers with basic toppings wrapped in foil, and fries don't hold up well. Cold, soggy, mess. 

Don't bother calling ahead either. It's far from convenient. While you order a burger and fries over the phone be aware that they will ONLY cook the burger, and when you show up to pay then they drop the fries. So the burger has already been done and just sits in the tightly wrapped foil making everything wet and soggy by the time you get home. Having to order online or the phone, arriving to have half your order cooked and wait longer is NOT CONVENIENT. It has been quoted they wait to drop the fries when you arrive to keep them ""fresh"". Well what about the other items you made before that? Why specify you want everything cooked and ready at the same time? Isn't the point of having phone/online ordering to make it quick, convenient, ready to go, without ANY WAIT?

Prior to visiting here, we've only been to their Uptown Plaza location on Central and Camelback. I vouched for that place several months ago, giving them a solid four-star rating. Unfortunately, during our most recent visit, something went terribly wrong with the ice cream's consistency. The crew apparently did something incorrectly, which caused the ice cream to appear normal initially, but melted within less than a minute. And I'm not exaggerating when I say this. After just a minute, my arms were completely covered in ice cream as the consistency quickly turned to liquid. In a brief ""moment of rage,"" I deemed mine to be useless and tossed it in the garbage. However, when I contacted the owner/franchisee about this issue, she was nice enough to send us out a couple of cards due to the mishap. We decided to check out this location for a change.

I ordered my usual Cap'n Crunch, while my girlfriend opted for Fruity Pebbles. In my other review, I claimed that the 30-minute wait time people were complaining about was nonsense, as we previously received our ice creams in less than five. But during this particular experience, I fully understand why they're whining. You have a boatload of people standing around impatiently waiting. One girl received hers - and by the time the boyfriend received his, she was practically finished. This, combined with the six dollar asking price for a small size without any additional toppings, is enough to turn off a lot of people. 

But once again, I will reiterate what I said in my Camelback review. The ice cream here is very good quality. When done properly, it has a nice, creamy texture, that is ranked right up there with some of my favorites. In fact, I don't really feel you need to go crazy with toppings. Just pick a base and a main ingredient and leave the rest alone. Good ice cream doesn't require a mountain of toppings, in my opinion.

Be prepared to wait and don't go in expecting to receive a bargain. But judging strictly on the quality of the ice cream alone, I think they're pretty damned good!",2017-06-01 16:33:43

Finding it wasn't so hard cause there was a giant shrimp on the building but once I walked in, I was wondering if this is supposed to be American/Creole or Asian. The establishment was very spacious and the decorations are VERY modern. You know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant that's supposed to be Asian but doesn't look Asian, you get a little skeptical ....

But what the heck, they had lamb skewers, or ""lamb sticks"" as they called it. I've been trying to find a good place that had lamb skewers for ages!

So, as a group, we ordered the hot pot stick in spicy, lamb skewers in med and spicy, and beef skewers in spicy. 

For the hot pot sticks, it came in a pitcher of hot pot soup with skewers. You got to choose 4 from the menu and we chose shrimp, beef tendon balls, fried tofu, and king oyster mushroom. The hot pot soup base was pretty much mala broth. It wasn't spicy, per say, it was just hot ... as in temperature hot. In the end, this dish was average. It wasn't anything special. Can I just order the king oyster mushrooms on its own?! 

The lamb skewers were very good but the flavor difference between medium spicy and spicy is huge. The medium spicy lamb skewers tasted sweet while the spicy ones were spicy. The medium spicy ones are a no go. I LOVED the spicy ones. They were DELICIOUS. They were exactly the type of lamb skewers I look for. Wonderfully seasoned with cumin and spicy flavor. The only thing was ... the pieces of meat were quite small. It would probably be better if the pieces were bigger and less well done. Oh and eat them while they're still hot because once it gets cold, it doesn't taste as good anymore.

The beef skewers on the other hand are a no go. I don't think beef and cumin are a good combination. Then again, maybe I'm just biased? I just like lamb better than beef when it comes to cumin and spicy seasoning. 

Overall. Lamb skewers are a go go go go. I will definitely come back for them and maybe try some of their seafood :)",2014-03-12 23:24:38

We went here for a friend's birthday, and upon recommendation of the bar, showed up at 10:30 PM (they said that otherwise we would be for sure waiting in line) and it was... dead. Maybe one other group on the main floor were there, but besides that, crickets. To top that off, it smelled SO BAD on the first floor that I thought about leaving. Straight toilet. TERRIBLE. I can't imagine it always smells like that, but... wow. 

SO in order to escape the smell, even though we were told there was a private party upstairs, we decided to break all the rules and head upstairs. I'm so happy we did, because if we hadn't this would have been a one star review. The upstairs atmosphere was a lot better - tons of people and decent music. We were able to snag some seats in a corner, and from there the night turned around!

My other complaint about Baby Huey's is the drinks. I guess I'm not a hipster, but I just really, really like my drinks to taste... tolerable. Maybe I'm a princess. BUT I really just think that those were some of the worst mixed drinks I've ever had. They were undergrad style undrinkable. Blergh. The price is right, but if the drinks are cringeworthy I'd rather pay more! I had to switch to beer, so I survived.

Sage is in my top five Las Vegas restaurants, so a visit to L.S. was a must do. The emphasis here is what I would call Sage Light with many menu items coming from the bright and shiny wood fired grill (the aroma was amazing). We started off with Feta and lamb stuffed Scotch Olives, 24 hour braised Porchetta, and Fois Gras Mousse with berry mostada and country toast. All were exceptional. Two of us had 8 oz. filet mignon cooked on the mesquite wood fired grill with roasted Maitake mushrooms and Béarnaise. The steaks were as good as any I've had in Las Vegas and perfectly cooked! My other friend had the seared Day Boat Scallops with  roasted peach purée, Lardo, and Calabrian Chili Vinaigrette. They were delicious but a lot spicer than expected in a good way. Delicious! The side vegetable was the dish we couldn't stop talking about. Wood grilled broccoli with Taleggio cream, wow! Too much food to order dessert, and the bill came to $211 plus tax.

I met the girls for happy hour. I didn't feel like a fussy house cocktail so I ordered my standard gin & soda. Too bad they had no specials for this very basic drink ($8, I think for a single). So I ended up paying a lot more than others with their whiskey lemonades or whatever-the-heck they ordered. 

After seeing the array of HH dishes ordered by others, I settled on the Kennebac Potato Fries and Hickman Farms Deviled Eggs. Both were tasty, indulgent snacks. I loved the rosemary on the fries and the generousness of the yolk mixture in the eggs (fork and knife were essential for me and my clumsiness). 

The sliders got good reviews as well, though I didn't try them. 

Decor was enjoyable. Service could have been better, but we were sitting in the lounge area so maybe they weren't as focused on us (however, it is happy hour in a hotel...I'd think they'd be paying attention, especially during this peak time).

I sat down next to their ""greenhouse"" only to realize that's their bakery in there! 

They came out with the croissant on a pleasant floral plate and bronze fork. Not only was the presentation delightful, the chocolate croissant was flaky and bigger than expected. In that case, the $5 croissant wasn't too bad.

UPDATE July 2014:  I have to reduce my previous 5-star rating to 3 stars!  Don't EVER go there on a Sunday morning, unless you enjoy waiting half an hour to an hour to get served!  We (party of 2) waited for 45 minutes, then sat down and waited another 15 minutes for our food!  A grand total of ONE HOUR between the time we walked in, and the time we got our breakfast!  NO breakfast is worth a 1 hour wait, especially with an 8 year old hungry kid in tow!  And to make matters worse, the place is packed with selfish, egotistical local SNOBS who take their sweet time eating, then hanging out as if at a cafe, instead of finishing their meals at a normal pace, then leaving to make room for others!

So, to sum things up, it's OK to go there on weekdays, but on Sunday mornings... FUHGEDDABOUDIT!

UPDATE October 2015:  They have a newer, more updated and 'upscale' menu now (don't like it as much), and they no longer put a jelly carousel on the table.  I liked the old First Watch a LOT better, since I had a choice of several jellies at my disposal.  Now I have to ask to see if they have the various flavors I like (and that they had).  I asked for grape, and they only had 'sugar-free' grape, which I will not imbibe because it tastes terrible and has artificial sweeteners.  Lastly, their pumpkin pancakes taste a bit 'off' (IHOP blows them away), and the prices have gone UP!  Are they trying to cater to only upper middle class Westlake now?  It sure feels that way!",2012-09-30 04:45:21

By the time the cashier hands you your change and you pour your soda, you will have a sandwich in your hand. Because JJs makes sandwiches freaky fast!

Bonuses:
-They accurately prepare your order (my hubby and I special order our sandwiches and they have never messed up the order!) 
-Consistency - you know what you're getting
-The veggies are fresh (shredded lettuce, Roma tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado spread). This is a big deal for me, as brown lettuce is a real sandwich letdown.  You won't find that here. 
-Fresh bread - with free smells 
-Special order sandwiches and keep it low fat
-They deliver (I can't review on this, as I only grab and go)

This may not be my favorite sandwich ever, but jimmy johns is winning at making you lunch in a hurry & offering a healthy alternative to normal fast food, while meeting all of the criteria (see bonuses) that I expect in a chain restaurant.

The last time I was here was probably almost 7 years ago.   We came here yesterday on a Friday night.  I was actually thinking of trying out Sushi Kiku but forgot the name and ended up at Yang's.  I knew that I had the wrong place when my husband made a left turn on Hwy 7.  Anyway, I had already made reservations so we just went with it.  I'm surprised that this place is still around after all these years so It's a good sign.

The place looked pretty empty but then I realized that there was another section in the back which was full.  It felt a lot more lively in the back.  The place looked a bit dated.  I was surprised that there was no iPad for ordering.   It's still the old fashion way of ordering to your server.   They really should update to iPads....I see why their staff are not happy...they are running around to each table at least 4/5 times taking orders in addition to clearing plates and refilling teapots, etc.   I'm sure if they invest in the iPad ordering system, they will have happy staff and happy customers!!

As for the food, we quite enjoyed it.   There were a few items that we would definitely skip next time.  So what items were good and bad?

Good:
Unagi and Spicy Salmon hand rolls
Sirloin steak - very nicely done!
Unagi pancake - limit 1 - tasty!
Grilled Black Cod - very tasty!
Salmon & Sweet Shrimp(limited) sashimi
Enoki Mushroom Beef roll
Mango yogurt

Bad
Deep fried banana - just wrong!
Ginger milk dessert

As you can see there weren't too many bad dishes.   We also had the King crab leg (limit 1), Hokkaido scallop (limit 1), Shrimp tempura and the Chawamushi steam egg which were okay but nothing special.

If you don't live in the area it's not worth trying but it's a decent place if you feel like Japanese AYCE.",2018-02-17 15:48:34

My son has been taking private swim lessons for the last year at the Aquatic Center.  They also have group lessons which he was in before.  I really like the one on one attention he gets in the private lessons.  He moves through the levels much more quickly in private so it is worth the extra $$ to me.  Also 2 people from the same family can be in private lessons together for the same price.  That is what we do with our twins.  So that helps a little on the price.  Their activity pool is awesome.  Lots of water features and slides.  It gets really busy in the summer so make sure to come early.  The line can get long and the chairs and umbrellas go quick.  On the Rec Center side, they have a gym, basket ball court, racquetball court, and lots of class rooms.  My kids have taken, karate, dance, pre-k classes and more.  It is a great way to see if they like something before spending a lot of money on it.  All the classes are very reasonable in price and the instructors have been great.  They also have youth sports like soccer, basketball, baseball and tennis.  My son has had a wonderful experience in their youth sports programs.",2013-01-17 15:45:59

The 2 things worth eating are the Andy's sage chicken and the brown sugar banana flapjacks. I've tried other things on their menu and they've all been disappointing (Chicken and waffles, the Hash). Andy's is a bunch of chicken, potatoes, egg, etc. etc. layered on top of each other with sauce dripping down. Its good- maybe share.

I went here at around 11-11:30am on a Monday. Of course it wasn't packed, but closer to lunch time it started to gather more and more anxious, hungry customers of all shapes and sizes. There were suits, hipsters, mommies, teenagers, etc etc..... The atmosphere is perfect in here. It's dimly lit, it can be romantic if you want it to or just relaxing if you're gulping down a drink with a friend. 

FOOD: chicken drumsticks come in 3 and they're $3 each, minimum order of 3. Cheap for what you get - the sauce was AMAZZZZIIINNNGGG!!! GLORIOUS, DELICIOUS, ORGASMIC you name it. We ordered the third flavour from the end...I can't remember what it's called but it's a version of Habanero. It gets spicier as you move down the list - ending with Naga (ghost pepper which is deadly. try at your own risk...). Super duper amazing. One of the best chicken drumsticks I have ever had.

Then the open faced sloppy Josephine with duck fat fries - it comes on a piece of really really really soft bread, mixed with grilled veggies, delicious sauce and lettuce with some kind of creamy chipotle on top. It was messy but doable and horrible mouthwatering. Just embarrassing how much I salavated at this place... 

Next we have the Haute Poutine - duck fat fries, cheese curds and duck confit.....jesus all mighty....this food must be served to the gods. IT WAS AMAZING. taste buds were just exploding all over the place.

I recommend his to anyone and everyone. They have awesome beers on tap, great witty quotes all over the walls, cute waitresses (i fell in love with mine, have been stalking her since), cheap Jagger....anything anyone could ask for. 

THIS PLACE IS NOT OVERRATED!!!! It's not even AYCE and look how much I'm raving about it...it must be a gem.

I've been here...maybe 3 times. Twice with coworkers for lunch and once with my fiancée because he wanted to try it. All 3 times were disappointing! 

1. Sorry but service sucks....staff don't really seem to be happy to be there or care about their job. 

2. Food is meh. A coworker once ordered an AVOCADO salad but only had one bite of it. Seriously? For an avocado salad there should be at least half of one in there. During my last visit I ordered half a sandwich with a Caesar salad...instead I got a garden salad with some vinaigrette dressing I didn't like. Overall their food always seems to be made half-a$$ed.

3. They no longer offer a choice of an apple, chips or bread. They just give you the bread. So if you've never been there you wouldn't even know that there's an option for an apple or chips. Sooo if you're getting a sandwich, guess what? You're getting a side of bread to go with it...

4. HOWEVER, they have really good cookies, pastries and drinks! At least they have that going! Cookies are super soft and tasty! Also their iced green tea and hazelnut coffee isn't so bad! 

5. Too expensive for what you're getting... I could make a better meal with the same ingredients for much cheaper. 

Basically....never going to panera again! Not at this location anyway",2016-09-14 02:53:35

The glazed lemon marinate on the skin is just screaming with flavor! Literally yelling at me! The chicken is tender, and full of meat so you don't feel shorted on meat. Because I can't finish it I usually do the quarter sides with two sides for $7.95. For the bigger meat eaters, I'd suggest the half dark with two sides $9.25. 

They have a long list of sides. My personal suggestion would be the mixed veggies, hummus, sweet potatoe mash, or the seasoned potatoes. Also, MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT GARLIC SAUCE. It's all about that garlic sauce. If I could write a sonnet on love based on this garlic sauce it would be..""love, you are my garlic sauce, and I would spread you all over my dying chicken, covered in delicious lemon sauce.

Our server, Allison, was just as friendly as can be and we were treated like maybe we were her best friends and I just forgot. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful where the devil is in the details. From an open kitchen to fresh flowers throughout, the decor exceeded my expectations. 

I started with their wedge salad with green goddess dressing ($6) and my better half had the roasted red pepper and tomato with sweet corn cream ($6). Although the salad was good, I wished I had have chosen the soup as it was excellent. If you like tomato soup, this would be a good choice. 

For our entrees, I ordered the house signature wood fired mussels with shallot white wine & fennel broth ($18) I am a ""originally from Seattle"" food snob and know good seafood. These mussels were fresh and the fennel broth was perfect. The mister ordered the fish of the day, a pan fried cod fillet with fresh veggies (our server said the veg was purchased earlier in the day from the farmers market) and lemon butter sauce ($19). This dish too was a thumbs up.

Starting with cocktails.. You're only choice is the shiso martini. Literally the only choice. It's a bit sweet. It's a bit minty. It's all delicious. It's one of the best cocktails I have ever had. 
Stay away from the cherry slinger. I repeat: stay away from the cherry slinger.

On to appetizers.. I would recommend the spicy scallop chips (a scallop and tobiko mixture served on top of pringles with avocado) and a tartar (served with a quail egg).

They had the otoro on special that night, which is the highest grade of underbelly tuna. It was absolutely divine. It was like butter--melted right in your mouth.

Only negatives of the night? We ordered the royal crap roll and instead received the soft shell crab roll. Also, they serve traditional mochi instead of mochi ice cream. I didn't totally enjoy either, but it was cool to try traditional mochi.
