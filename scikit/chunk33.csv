I found this Yelp page by chance while searching for a tea/coffee shop where I could get some work done. Honestly, I'm disappointed it took me so long.

At the employee's recommendation, I opted for the milk tea trio, with roasted oolong tea base. Be warned, with 3 toppings, it's more dessert than beverage! I'm not normally a taro lover, but I enjoyed the fresh taro paste a lot more than I expected to. The tapioca pearls were soft and chewy, and the pudding was smooth and decadent. Despite the roasted tea flavour being less pronounced than I normally like, it was pretty much love at first sip.

I was the only customer at half past 3 on a weekday, so the cafe was very quiet. The background music was tinkly at first, then became more upbeat into the early evening hours as more customers came in.  Because my work laptop has a low battery life, I really appreciated the availability of power outlets! The only thing I would say about working here is that the small tables are a bit low in height, which means you'll likely need to bend over to see your screen. The cafe is spacious, with plenty of natural lighting, and 2 gender neutral washrooms.

Before leaving, I ordered another milk tea trio for my partner, but sadly they were out of pudding at the time. I was encouraged to choose taro balls instead -- not my fave, but I think it's cool that they offer this. I originally tried taro paste and taro balls at Meet Fresh in the US, and had not seen these toppings offered in Canada so far.

Overall, I know it's premature to consider this a new go-to since I've only tried one drink, but I'm really impressed with this cafe. I'll continue to support this local business in giving the big chains a run for their money.

P.S. The Vicinity reward program is offered here!",2019-05-12 21:18:53
EMJlAvL64TX6Y31rBqOaPA,jlu4CztcSxrKx56ba1a5AQ,sjJOsKnXxsQodXMr1i8fsg,4,13,7,12,"The most known mall in Toronto which attracts some of the biggest traffic in all of Canada. Eaton Centre is located right at the heart of Downtown Toronto where Dundas Square and Nathan Phillips Square is.

I would recommend taking public transport to the Eaton Centre because you have to pay for parking and to get to the mall from the parking is a hassle for me.

Eaton Centre has their shops arranged where the bottom floor generally has the more affordable products, and keeps going up the hierarchy until you reach the top brands located at the top and the food court located at the very bottom. 

Eaton Centre has the most intense lineups when something hype comes out, but it's probably also one of the first places that will have that item if you're into being the first to buy things that just come out.

The design of the mall is a rectangle with a few bizzare odds and ends sticking in and out of it, so it might be a little challenging if you want to go around the escalators, but if you're a commuter and go to the PATH, you're probably a pro at it by now.",2018-04-15 11:37:29

Restaurant is decent size. Plenty of tables and chairs to sit at. Menu is up above the front counter. I ordered the burrito with carne asada, flautas, and a side of rice and beans - all to go

The food was packaged nicely for a to- go bag,  I was given many different sauce options. However no utensils or napkins.

For those unfamiliar, it's a dipping noodle with concentrated broth. I've yet to find any ramen place that has good Tsukemen.. until I tried sojo!

I got the Black Garlic Tsukemen. The presentation was super nice and the portion was huge! The broth itself was really good too. We also ordered karaage and sausage as appetizers. Our server was kind enough to bring out complimentary calamari to try as well. I don't usually like calamari but it was especially good, we ended up eating it all. It was extra buttery and not greasy! All the apps were less than a few dollars each. Also, they serve a really good salad to begin your meal.

0 wait time when we went but I expect this place to fill up soon. They have yelp check in for the waiting list which is a major perk.

The pho was utterly disappointing. First, the broth wasn't piping hot. The beef portion was skimpy and it wasn't rare as indicated on the menu. The broth wasn't pungent as it should be. However, the noodles itself was very good - al dente!

If you like kids, or have kids, this is a good spot for you in the summer. Beware that they only sell junk food and there is only one bar. It's basically Wasaga Beach but only minutes from the city. Also worth noting, they don't allow bikes on the Centre Island Ferry. In case it's your first time, ferries run every 15 minutes on the weekend, cost $6 for adults and are free to get back.

xA08VIpxU0SG_d3pwtfyLA,0911xXCgLexupPGkDJusLQ,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,4,2,0,1,"My boyfriend and I were hungry for lunch on a Thursday. We decided to stop by On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina at 11:00 A.M, right as the restaurant opened.

On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina is located at the 95/Ann exit (North or South bound). It shares the same parking space as the In-n-Out and Raising Cane's Chicken. Parking can get a little difficult at this restaurant due to how busy In-N-Out and Raising Cane's Chicken can get. 

Since the restaurant had just opened, there was plenty of table spacing available for us inside the restaurant. Everything was clean and spotless inside. We were immediately greeted by the host and provided a booth table.

Our waiter immediately came out to our table, provided us menus, and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We had requested [2] waters and [1] diet coke. The drinks were out to our table in several minutes along with chips and salsa. By the time our waiter came back to the table, we were ready to order!

Appetizers:
Chicken Satay with BBQ

Meal [Entrees]:
Burrito (steak)
Chicken Fajitas

The appetizer came out shortly after we had ordered our meal, in about 5 minutes. The chicken Satay's were arranged beautifully on the plate, along with the BBQ sauce. I had tried a bite, unfortunately, it was a bit too spicy for my taste. If you like spicy food though, you should order the Chicken Satay's.  The fried breading was cooked perfectly and the chicken quality was very good with the bite that I had.

Shortly afterwards, our meals came to the table. WOW!!! I was left almost breathless at the portion of the entree size meal! You could easily share a entree with a friend or partner. If you order a entree solo, you'll be guaranteed enough food for a extra meal or two.

My boyfriend's burrito that he ordered was huge! It also came with a side of rice and beans, which was a lot as well. The burrito was quite scrumptious. It had Pico de Gallo, beans, steak, rice, sour cream, and onions inside. 

I had ordered the Chicken Fajitas. It came with Chicken, Bell peppers, Onions with a side of flour tortillas, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, pico de gallo, rice, and beans. There was barely any cheese or pico de gallo offered on the side. I had ended up ordering extra pico de gallo for the fajitas. The food was really good though and I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. I had enough food left-over for dinner the same day!

Great service. Our waiter came and checked on our table multiple times while we ate lunch at On The Border Mexcian Grill & Cantina. It was a little expensive though. Our meal came out to be approximately $40.00 and that was with a BOGO entree meal for the restaurant coupon that we had provided.",2019-11-23 20:15:25

For the exceptional mix of fantastic staff, prime location, quality services and unbeatable prices I can't think of another place in the city. I will state for the record that given the opportunity I would opt for somewhere else with some outdoor bath action (bota bota nearby being a probable option). That being said, none of the other spas nearby have an everything-included situation like Scandinave. My preferred deal here is the early-morning massage: for $90 you get a 60 minute Swedish massage followed by unlimited access to the bath and saunas. With that you get the sandals, a locker, a big plushy robe and a towel. It's also worth noting that all of the massages I've had there have been top notch. 

This place really nails it on the details: it's a beautiful space, they really enforce the quiet rule, there's lot of friendly staff available, there's free snacks and filtered water, and most importantly (for me) it's spotless.

I parked our vehicle in the parking lot behind the bank from across the street, but was told after the fact, that there is parking at the rear of this place.  You just have to drive through this narrow driveway to access it.

We were early, despite the fact that reservations were made for our table. The waiting area is not much of a waiting area.  It is the narrow entrance/exit area and there is few seating, so it's basically standing around for a bit and trying to stay out of people's way.

The restaurant is not that big...A bit claustrophobic and the lighting is fairly dim.  When we were shown to our table, the lighting above, was blown out.  We were told that despite having the fixture repaired a number of times, with the restaurant structure being a century or so old, it had a 'mind of its own'. We basically had to read the drink and food menu either by candle-light (available during the evening at each table) or by the lighting of our cellulars.

Our waitress was extremely friendly and had a sense of humour.  Kudos to her, which is the reason I am providing the third star for my rating.  Bless her heart!  She knew the specials of the day and was very professional when serving us our drinks and our meals.

Now for the food...There was no pizza offered during our Saturday evening dining experience.  Apparently it is only offered during certain days of the week.  Just NOT Saturday.  So most of us at our table ordered pasta dishes.  

In my opinion, the dishes were slightly bland.  But you could tell that the pasta was definitely hand-made.  There's the bonus.  

Same goes with the dessert.  No true pizzaz but still somewhat satisfactory.

I guess, in my case, if your better half is your personal chef and cooks with a lot of flavoring and is a cake-decorator, nothing else beats their cooking.

Macarons were awful.  I've had many across the GTA and I'm sorry to say they were really the worse I've had.  The raspberry chocolate tasted like cough syrup and was under baked - very, very soggy, wet and gooey.  Green tea was brown in color (odd) and lacked flavor, salted caramel was the best one.  Pistachio, again, no flavor, early grey ... was that earl grey?  

Donut had a tiny sliver of chocolate hazelnut. Honestly, if you're in the area, give it a try but it's really not worth to go out of your way. There are a ton of better pastry shops in Toronto!!!

I used to kind of frequent this place and the buffet here on Sunday's for the most part they've been pretty good. I met some friends here for a Friday dinner, the hosts were ok, seem too interested in greetings when I addressed them to let them know I was meeting people already there. 

As for service, it was just ok too. I guess we came as our first waitress was about to take a break and she seemed more in a ""rushy"" sense to get our orders in and get out to make the switch. She wasn't too helpful when asking a couple of questions on the menu items, just gave us the short short answers as if she could careless. As she left her replacement was so much better at service and answering the questions we had for the menu items, I understand the previous waitress wanted to take her break but we didn't know until she said something and being in the customer service field myself a customer shouldn't feel ""rushed"" there are techniques training provides to mitigate things like this. Also, the first waitress didn't communicate well to the other waitress on our order so there were things missing that we had to tell the replacement waitress that we had ordered and was not delivered.

Anyhow all the food we ordered was great, which explains the 3-star rating. We started with the loaded nachos app, I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, my buddies had steak & potatoes and orange chicken with fried rice. The only complain I have for food was the nachos was a little bare, meaning not much cheese and chicken chunks were put on sparsely.

The parts of the cafe I saw seemed pretty clean and wasn't too busy. Our replacement waitress was great, it's unfortunate that our first waitress gave us a crappy first impression with a dirty taste.",2019-09-14 21:31:27

Cafe Sanuki is a knock off of Japan's largest udon chain Marugame (for Hawaii yeeps, think our own knock off, Marukame).  

Also guessing it's Chinese and not Japanese (kunbu - Chinese on the menu vs KONBU - Japanese).  It doesn't matter as many everyday noodle shops in Japan are Chinese.  Making this place ""authentic"".  Go fig.

Machine made, glutinous and chewy, properly cooked udon.  Very basic Sanuki broth (lighter style, soy added to a simple bonito / konbu (dried fish / dried kelp) broth).  Ordered cafeteria style, pickup a few pieces of tempura and a musubi, pay and eat.  In and out in 10 minutes without making a dent in your wallet.

The kake (finished broth) and bukake (stop it, dirty minds - add your own concentrated broth) easily the best and the best value at $5.55.  Variants include adding meat (niku), egg (kamatama) and cold (zaru).  Lots of yoshoku and silly Americanized combos as well.  None sampled.  Seriously?  Seafood tomato cream udon?

Very ordinary tempura.  Excessively oily, over cooked, somewhat rubbery from having the batter over mixed.  You get what you pay for.  For between $1 - $2 all good.

Musubis also just OK.  Everyday short grain rice, typical ""fillings"" (spicy tuna, tuna with mayo, plum, spam), crisp laver surrounding it.  Over compacted but flavorful inari (cone sushi).  Again, sub $2, what do you expect.  

New, clean and friendly service.

Solid, quick and cheap just as it should be.",2017-12-04 16:05:47

They said they'd get a table ready for us but didn't say how long it would be and after a few groups went in ahead of us we were a bit confused. After a seat cleared my boyfriends sister went to go sit down on it- 10 minutes later the lady (who still hasn't told us how much longer it would be) walked up to us and asked to use the chair she was sitting on! I couldn't believe it (there were other seats in the restaurant for her to take) and 20 mins later (40 minutes of waiting for her to tell us how much longer it would be). We didn't complain since it was busy but it doesn't really explain how badly we were handled. 

When we sat down we ordered the cheese dish that gets set on fire and they came and gave it to us without us even knowing they set it on fire.... or saying OPA! At this point we were starting to get annoyed. (the cheese was good) 

The waiter came to get our order and the food came and they gave me the wrong dish... They offered to correct it but at this point everyone would be finished eating by the time they would have had time to replace it so i said it was okay. At this point we mentioned the cheese and they brought over another one (they did this complimentary). 

The bill came and we saw they still charged for the wrong order that i didn't eat... We were annoyed and i felt as if they knew that so we didn't think anything would be done so we paid and left.

The hostess was very friendly and a few people even recognized him as he comes here a lot. This was my first time and he was taking me out for a treat. Everything in this place is so delicately placed. I loved the array of jewels on the table, it's a very nice touch. I ordered a very nice glass of cabernet and they also brought out a delicious amuse-bouche. Some kind of cute quinoa ball. It was actually really good, almost too cute to eat. The bread cart is out of this world. There were two kinds with cheese so of course I had to try those, plus my boss recommended the milk one.... That one practical melts in your mouth. I think our waiter knew it was my first time and that I barely got to eat any of the extremely fresh butter so he recommended that I try some crusty bread... And I tried to say no, but I'm so glad I accepted. It was so good. 

Then they brought out some kind of caviar served on top of something with a cauliflower puree. Next they brought out my appetizer of
truffled langoustine ravioli in a foie gras sauce with simmered green cabbage... And it was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend. I had never heard of langoustine before, but Abel said it was like a cross between lobster and  shrimp. He's right that was exactly how it tasted. It was so good. 
The staff was incredibly effective and helpful to ensure that no allergy or intolerance was missed. They take great care in paying attention to detail. My main course was the ribeye and it was obviously very good but they brought out these mashed potatoes and oh my goodness... Best mashed potato puree EVER.

Located in Winston Churchill area, this Cineplex is where the famous iFly location is (this is easily visible when you are driving on the 401 back to Toronto from the West end). The entrance is difficult to find, because this area of fun is made into it's own little village. However, we were able to find the entrance by following folks entering the cinema as well.

Once we entered, the Xscape was located right up front. There were quite a few people playing here, despite the Dave and Busters location being next door. 

Since it was a long weekend, the lineups were MASSIVE. Literally, it was close to being out the door, but this was also because people didn't use the round-about lines properly. If a Cineplex staff came to regulate this, it might have been better. In addition, there were stations were you can purchase tickets from a KIOSK machine. The line for this was confusing as well, it seemed that people can just go to it even if they just entered and didn't actually need to line up for this. 

The ticket entry point was VERY clear though, and blocked off quite well with two attendants at the door. Once inside the movie theatre, there was a lot more space and signs were labelled very clearly where all of the auditoriums were.

My friend and I also grabbed the cauliflower karaage which was a great app and some bao buns -- jackfruit for me, bird (fried chicken) for my friend -- and they turned out to be pretty delicious as well.

I decided to try out bartending, but what school to go to? ABC came highly recommended, and now I know why. 
From the first moment I called, after hours, and got a return call less than ten minutes later, I knew they were all about customer service. 
I visited a night class, and met with the instructor, Larry. He told me all about their program and their business history, all the while telling amusing stories and anecdotes. I was really disappointed that I would have to take daytime classes, and miss out on Larry.
I came to apply for the school during the daytime. The instructor/owner Greg, was very gracious and, even though I was interrupting a class, he took the time to explain everything, how the program worked, what's expected, etc.
Right away, when class, started, I saw that Greg, too, was fun, funny, BUT he took the education seriously. YES: He can yell like a drill instructor, but he also cares like a father to his children. I think if you can't take yelling from a caring teacher, how are you gonna handle drunks at a bar?!
During the classes, Greg (and I presume Larry, too) tell wonderful stories that help you remember the drinks, and have a good time (Brandy (That slut!) who works as a sTinger at the SpearMINT Rhino.. Take the class, and you'll know why I'll never forget this drink recipe!). 

As a newbie to bartending, I took the two-week class: three hours a day, for ten days (Monday-Friday). This gave me time to study. I got to know other students in the class. We studied off each other. The break times (such as when others come in to sign up) were helpful, also, to absorb the information just taught. 

ABC is licensed by the state of Nevada, and their course changes and evolves to keep up with current trends and popular drinks. 

Once graduated, they don't forget about you. No sir! They have a job listing program in which many of the local bars and casinos contact ABC to hire new graduates. These places want to get people before they develop bad habits.

I am so glad we did!  It's located at a good location - relatively close to the freeway.  They offer a wide variety of classes.  Classes are offered every day at almost every hour.  They even have Ballroom Dancing!!!  

Instructors - they are awesome!  I have not had one bad instructor, and there are many instructors!!!  If you feel like kicking it at yoga today, they have instructors for that.  Feel like getting your butts kicked, they definitely have instructors for that as well! 

Cleanliness - the classrooms themselves are relatively cleaner than other studios in town.  They use these microbial mats/carpets which doesn't stink!  (If you've been to hot yoga with carpets, you'd know what I mean - STINKY!)  Practicing hot yoga in a stinky room = no bueno. 

VegasHot also offers purified water for everyone to fill their bottles with, which is AWESOME to replenish your body with electrolytes.  Oh, did I mention it is FREE? 

Students are offered unbelievable rates, and one of the reason why they can offer such rate is because of their ""tipping"" system.  This is one way for students to show their appreciations for their instructors.  

I have had plenty of offers to try other studios in town, but I honestly think I have found the studio I am willing to commit to!  And that's saying a lot.  Yay!",2012-05-04 04:59:13

After the original location in Yorkville, followed by South Beach, the newest restaurant on Queen Street has a definite Asian flair.

Coat check is available upon arrival. The bar sits at the front of the house, surrounded by tables, overlooking the streetcars gliding along Queen Street. A few steps up brings us to the main dining room, with softer lightning and plenty of seating. Japanese maples dominate the centre of the room, while bold wallpaper adorns the walls. At the back, the kitchen is visible through a large amber glass panel.

The menu comprises of offerings ranging from nigiri, maki rolls and salads, through dumplings and small plates, all the way to larger wok, noodles & rice dishes.

I was intrigued by the Japanese inspired offerings, and decided to start with  Mushroom and Unagi Eggplant nigiri, followed by Rainbow Roll. The Unagi Eggplant (lemon, pomegranate) was served in unagi sauce, and did a notable job mimicking the texture of real unagi (eel). The mushroom nigiri (truffled soya) texture was interesting and reminded me of abalone. The Rainbow Roll (ahi watermelon, avocado, crispy mushroom, gochujang) had nice flavor; the crispy mushroom strongly reminded me of deep fried fish texture.They were both nice light starters for a meal.

Our first main course - General Lee's Cauliflower (sesame, scallions) - was seared in a sweet sauce; the outer crust had a nice texture, slightly crunchy; the serving size was on the small size for a main. Our second main - Udon (truffle scented mushrooms, miso coconut milk, chives) - was absolutely our favorite dish of the evening; the coconut sauce was heavenly (not sure if there was green curry or something else in it, besides miso), and paired very well with the mushrooms and greens (I believe baby bok choi and watercress). I wish they had bread, so I could soak and have all the sauce at the bottom of the dish.

On our server's recommendation, for dessert we ordered Hawaiian Pineapple (bubble tea pearls, passion fruit gelato, lime leaf) and Halo Halo (matcha gelato, tropical fruits, purple potato, condenses coconut milk). Hawaiian Pineapple was our favorite; it was refreshing, not overly sweet, and the flavors were simple but memorable; honestly, I could not tell there was passion fruit in the gelato. Halo Halo was colorful and interesting with many different flavors, but seemed that something was missing to bring them all together.

Service is professional and efficient. Parking is available in one of the numerous parking lots in downtown, such as city hall or on the corner of St. Patrick St. and Michael Sweet Ave. Easy TTC access by subway on University Ave. or streetcar on Queen St.",2019-03-31 23:29:39

One of the staff insist on giving us a number for a table when there's one available? Anywho, we ordered the curry beef brisket with rice, french toast and iced milk tea. I have to say I'm most impressed with their milk tea. The tea that they used is legit and brought back memories of local hk resturants. The French toast was awesome too. The crust was light and crispy. There's also peanut butter inside. It might lack originally with the breading, but the taste is on point. I'm most disappointed with the curry beef brisket.

ZJBfHqKVxprmeGcL68SvAw,ZtWi1WgfiiBlKmBA8VS4NQ,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,4,1,0,1,"My first Korean barbecue experience was here at Hobak. The only reason why I chose this restaurant to dine at was because Andrew Zimmerman recommended it. (I think I saw it on Travel Channel or the Food Network) Also, my girlfriend and her husband highly recommended it. Thankfully for my first experience here my friend and her husband came with us. 

Something to know is this restaurant does not take reservations and they are very busy so do not show up with a empty stomach because there is going to be a wait. We ended up waiting about 35 mins for our table. 

Once inside the atmosphere reminded me of a nightclub. There was a lot going on and it was very loud. Being that this was my first time here, I felt a little overwhelmed and wasn't really sure what was going on. Our server was very nice we let her know that it was our first time but the people that were with us had been there before. We were a party of 4 she recommended that we ordered 2 family meals and adding in a extra protein. She told us that this would be saving us money in the long run. (To be honest with you I didn't even take a look at the menu because the couple that we are with just agreed to what she had suggested). The table was crowded with lots of different items to taste (dipping sauces, salt, salads, soup, egg soufflé...etc) we had so much food. Probably could have done without the desert but it was included in the family meal. The whole experience was very cool, I did like that our server cook the meat for us. However, I would've like to do it myself because some of the meat was undercooked tremendously and some was overcooked. The other thing that I noticed was a lot of the meat had a lot of fat on it. If you're not one that likes fat on your steak this is your warning. My husband is one of those people so I ate the fatty meat and he ate most of the shaved meat. 

I would highly recommend this place if it's your birthday because they go all out singing and dancing (which was a huge surprise because I wasn't expecting that! )They have amazing Korean cocktails made of soju and the Korean beer was delicious. 

Last but not least you must check out the bathroom! Not only do you get a lesson in Korean blaring through the speaker they also offer throwaway toothbrushes, toothpaste and mouthwash. (Loved that) 

Overall four stars out of five because of the meat debacle and I felt a little bit rushed to get out of our table since people were waiting.",2019-09-06 18:42:14

ACIElmRvCvwClTGV7YXykQ,JdYkvy8lIodJ0vwJ4jzYYA,_awu1HfNZWgBo6z9RU2CLA,2,7,3,0,"This place is beyond ridiculous!! This hospital has become an inside joke and NO ONE IS LAUGHING but no one cares either! This is the absolute worst care I have ever received and I can't understand why all the bad or less than 3 star reviews are basically ""filtered"". As of writing this there are 63 reviews that are filtered addressing the same issues that I have faced so who wouldn't want to know about this?  I know I'm not the only patient who struggles with their mistakes and incompetence. 
  PARKING:  AN ABSOLUTE JOKE!!!  The lines of traffic are LONG, you never know if the bar is going to rise up and let you in and the parking attendants (if there is one around, it's been 50/50).  I miss when they had actual parking attendants in a booth but to ""save money"" they got rid of them and now you deal with a ticket system and HOPE, WISH, and PRAY it all works out.  It didn't work out for me.  An attendant was standing by the gate but as soon as the bar went up, I moved forward and the BAR CAME RIGHT BACK DOWN ON THE HOOD OF MY CAR!!!!!  WHAT THE *#@!!!  All the parking attendant could say is, ""Why isn't this working??""  ""YOU TELL ME HONEY!""  Eventually, the bar came back up and I FLOORED it past the gate bar so it wouldnt damage my car.  After inspection though, (THANKFULLY the bar had padding underneath) it didn't even scratch my car.  This is still NO excuse!  One of the nurses even told me it's getting worse for parking!  They actually make their employees PAY FOR PARKING EVERY MONTH!  As much as $50 a month! Now they are raising it even more from what they said!  Plus, they do NOT get any discounts on food, (FULL PRICE FOR EVERYONE).  I can understand why some employees are upset and work at other hospitals.
  I was sitting in the digestive diseases area at main campus and apparently I'm just supposed to ""sit and wait"" for an hour of NOTHING before my procedure. What a joke! I wasn't told this beforehand, it just appeared they changed my schedule time (again) without telling me.  I guess I'm SUPPOSED to sit here even before being prepped for a procedure and wait an hour before any procedure without explanation. Meanwhile this tiny 15 chair waiting room is about to become ""Standing Room Only"" it has become so full in the past hour of waiting. Not only that, there is a sign saying ""If you're leaving the waiting area , please stop by the front desk to pick up a pager."" This means you WILL be waiting so go ahead and leave, we'll page you causing an inconvenience to other patients and making them wait longer. If this isn't enough, the secretaries have NO manners or even a care in the world beyond themselves because I kept confronting them on my appointment and they just repeated what I already knew and when I asked for the pager it's ONLY for families! This is just some of MANY issues the Cleveland Clinic suffers from but there is obviously the feeling that  there is some ""covering up"" of what REALLY goes on at the Main Campus because all of these problems and issues should be addressed within the Clinic.  THIS IS NOT WORLD CLASS CARE! It's World Class Carelessness! 
   The ONLY redeeming quality here are the doctors but they can't really do anything about this inconvenience because most of the doctors are not even aware of several issues.  My doctor was upset for me that I waited right around 90 minutes and NONE of her staff, nurses or aides called me back before being prepped for my procedure.  This is POOR communication, POOR service and on top of that if you know I'm upset DON'T insert an IV in one arm and check my blood pressure in the other arm AT THE SAME TIME!!! Nursing 101: PAIN MAKES BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASE ESPECIALLY IF THE PATIENT IS ALREADY UPSET!!  
   I have never been mistreated and ignored like this at any hospital before and it's upsetting.  I was NPO (nothing by mouth so no food or drink) since the night before so I had an empty stomach, checked in at the time they told me (an hour before the procedure) thinking and believing that I would be prepped for my procedure.  Nope, because of everyone there I didn't have my procedure for almost an hour AFTER I was put in a bed so we are WAY behind schedule now.  I cannot believe that the Cleveland Clinic is regarded as high as it is but performs day to day like this.  I have never been scared before a procedure but being treated like this beforehand I can honestly say that I was worried how this whole procedure was going to turn out.  Overall, I lived. Yay.  The doctor was very understanding but the main campus suffers greatly from LACK of communication and that is leading to and causing both patients and staff to leave main campus and go elsewhere.  
     If you do find a good doctor at main campus you have to ask yourself is parking and a high volume of people and lack of communication worth it?? If you can manage that then I commend you and join you because with my health situation on top of finding a wonderful doctor that is difficult enough.",2016-12-30 15:01:49

Used to eat here back when I lived in Las Vegas - also when it was Ivan and Gina running the place. I recall really enjoying the food as well as their company/service but heading there for dinner last Saturday with a friend and my parents, I didn't really know what to expect. 

Good food and excellent service is what I got. 

I ordered the Combo plate: kalbi, meat jun, BBQ chicken, rice and macaroni salad. I loved everything but the kalbi. Something about it - no other way to describe it other than I've had better. It was cooked, so I'm not sure if it was the marinade or the quality of the meat - but my friend didn't like it as well and my parents didn't even try it.

The service was awesome. Gina was her usual hospitable self and even brought out some special dishes for the table. 

Everything was awesome except the lack of parking and the kalbi. If I lived in Las Vegas, I'd be a regular for sure; in time, the duke.",2012-02-17 06:06:50

While they've been there,  they've been serving some of the sweetest Ice Cream treats for many many decades.

Yes, Ice Cream Purists always downgrade them for being antiquated and serving ""Dreyer's"" Ice Cream. However, the multitudes that line the busy streets waiting to get in here on Friday and Saturday nights appear to be contrarian to such elevated Ice Cream perspectives.

Honestly, we come here often. Even if it's just to have a scoop of Ice Cream. We often sit by the bar and just enjoy each other's company. We always order different flavors so that we can share in each other's delightful selection for the evening.

It's nostalgic in the sweetest of ways. An Ice Cream Parlor that still engenders happy feelings of our youth. I first took my wife to Sugar Bowl during one of our dates many years ago. 

Don't come here for the food. The food really isn't what this place is about. You are going to get pretty standard diner fare, and might not like what you get. You come here for ice cream sundaes and the atmosphere of the soda shops of yesteryear. 

We will always love Sugar Bowl.",2019-04-23 06:36:24

My husband wanted to come here for our anniversary. Since I dictate about 90% of the restaurant choices we make, I figured this was my anniversary gift to him! I was pleasantly surprised how nice of an experience it was. 

They semi-recently remodeled and moved their bar to the lobby of the PNC building. It throws you off a little, but they must have needed the room for more seating? Although I will say, I made our reservations online a couple days before on a Friday night with ample time slots available. It still has that same dark decor and ambiance it used to have. I would have figured they'd mix it up a little, but hey, they have a brand/image they want to go with, so I can't fault them.

My tomato salad was good, and thankfully had some fresh tomatoes, even at the tail end of tomato season. I ordered the filet, and like I said, it was perfect. It was a pretty large filet and I devoured the whole thing. No regrets on that. We ordered the cauliflower app, and although they said there would be capers in it, there definitely wasn't. The dish missed something without them. The scallop potatoes were cheesy goodness though, so that made up for the bland cauliflower. 

Our server was friendly and really good about accommodating me being gluten free. A handful of items on the menu are GF, so it's super easy to navigate. They even gave us a complimentary ice cream dessert for our anniversary.

Selection wise they really have a little bit of everything - salad, sushi, egg rolls, cream cheese wontons, coconut shrimp, crab legs, broccoli chicken, and anything else you can think of. The price is also super reasonable too, but they do charge around $2 for soda/tea so if you're looking to conserve some money, stick to water.

I never went to Chuck E Cheese. And of course I never played laser tag. Did I cry? Yes many many times. Lol but I had the beach and the outdoors so I was alright. It just meant I got to enjoy these things as an adult.

I like the setup they have at Laser Quest. In the front they have some arcade games, a couple of hoop games, and an area where they have parties. You walk up to the counter and give them an code name, some name you want to be called. Pick an awesome name. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. When it's time to play laser tag you're brought into this room and explained all the rules. Then you're given your laser tag equipment and it's time to go. During the game when you're shot the name of the one who shot you will show up on your gun. Hunt them down and get them back. It's so much fun and open for all ages. Kind of felt sorry getting all the easy scores. After the game is over they'll announce everyone's names with scores and put up on a board for bragging right. You'll also get a print out of who you shot and who shot you during the game.

They had a deal where you can play all day for the price you'd pay for about 3 games. I was so tempted to get it after playing my 2nd game. Another time. I'm going to be a laser tag dork now. Don't judge me. In case you were wondering I'm not that great. I got a lot of people but they got me a lot more. I was near last place on both games. I got beat by little little people.

The energy level is incredibly high and you never know what or who you will see. For example, after leaving Harrah's at 6:30 a.m. and wanting nothing but sleep, I ran into Hey for Jim (see picture).

He told me he came to Vegas from his reservation two weeks ago and I was the first person of 400 to shake his hand. I asked myself if I was friendly or stupid. Surprisingly, he didn't ask for money. What he wanted was something very different (not that, you freak). :) 

He wanted me to spend the day with him on The Strip to go up to people on their phones to let them know they were ruining society and that we needed to go back to being human again. 

I told him it was a great concept but this was Sin City and people wouldn't care. I then told him I had to get some sleep. He shook my hand goodbye, but it was a trick. Once he had my hand, he squeezed tighter and wouldn't let go. 

At first, I squeezed harder and planned how to disarm him, but the endgame for that option ran through my mind (potential blood exchange and/or jail). Instead, I made my hand completely limp, which he didn't expect and allowed me to slip my hand away. 

Surprisingly, he was sad, not angry. I think he wanted a friend. I told him I'd see him later. I did see him later that night but I didn't approach him. He was drunk and tossed a cardboard sign onto Las Vegas Blvd that read: 'Native. Please Help!'

They have the basics, like sesame paste, hot chili, salt, etc. but I feel like there could be other sauce options that aren't just salty and spicy.

As soon as I walked in the place smelled like burnt popcorn, that should have been my first clue to leave.  I stood in line and waited my turn to get a soda and popcorn and my buddy went to go find us some seats.  When it was my turn I told the guy working the counter that I didn't want any of that burned popcorn and he said they threw it out.  Unfortunately, they have a do-it-yourself soda dispenser and so after you wait in line to get popcorn and a cup for your soda, you have to wait in another line to fill the cup.  This has got to be the worst idea ever, people struggling to balance their popcorn and snacks while working a touch screen with a 100 different soda selections, what a clusterfuck.  I finally get to my seat as the movie starts and I lean back in my chair and it gives out this loud screech so I make a mental note to sit upright the entire movie.  Then my friend starts moving around in his seat and it's also squeaking so I razz him about finding the two loudest chairs in the theater but as time passes I realize that ALL the seats in the theater are in desperate need of WD-40, it was like a symphony of squeaky seats.  Already, the experience isn't going well but then I nibbled down the top layer of popcorn and I realized that the rest of the back was small overcooked kernels.  I spent the next five minutes debating whether or not to miss part of the movie so I could go lay into these swill merchants.

There was a list of Asian-inspired drinks, and I had one with calamansi, which I absolutely loved. We really liked how small and intimate the place was and the decor!

The second time I came was with two friends for dinner. Together, we ordered three dishes and we were satiated. We had the pineapple pork bun, the taro nest and their version of a hainanese chicken rice.

Fortunately, we were able to order one more bun, instead of have to share two buns amongst three people. The meat was incredibly soft and the bun was flakey.

The taro nest/bird's nest is vegetarian, with the option to add meat. It tasted similar to something you could get on Chinatown, but slightly saltier. Our favourite was eating the taro nest!

My favourite dish in the world is Hainanese chicken rice made in Singapore. To my surprise, they had their version here which was somewhat similar and very rich in flavour. Our rich was also rich, but slightly salty My only complaint was that it was so good, I wish I could have ordered two plates.

I feel their quality has been slipping a lot lately and this drink was definitely sub-par. Unlike the early reviews of Chatime, I didnt see any line up at all.  With maybe only one family before me, this spot was empty unlike the other really popular spot (Real Fruit).  

Chatime was one of the original first imports of the really good Asian bubble tea spots.  They've opened a lot across the GTA in the past few years and hitting up most of the malls.  I feel this location really does a disservice.  Sure it's not the terribly fake powdery stuff of eons ago but this was just a really bad drink.  This is a purely take out counter with not many seated areas nearby.  There was only 4 small tables in the shared hallway for the Timmy's, Tsujiri and Chatime.  It does have a few snacks as well but bubble tea is their main focus.  Well, used to be.

Service here is polite and quick... almost too quick.  My drink was made within a minute and though there was no wait... I feel with no pressure to send out drinks, this should have been made a lot better.

Brown Sugar Roasted Black Tea - With less ice and half sugar, I figured the roasted black tea would have been a nice rich flavour and the milkiness be creamy.  What I got instead was a super watery milky lack lustre tea... actually, I couldnt taste tea.  That was a complete shock.  Though it wasn't sweet, it was also super watery.  It was missing the milkiness that I used to find in the Chatime drinks.  Another sad thing about this drink was the bubbles. The previous day I didn't get a lot of bubbles and they werent done well compared to other brands.  Today, they were definitely over cooked... they were mushy.  This is no where as good as it used to be.  2/5

Trader Joe's is a great place for produce. Most of the produce options are packaged in small quantities in plastic bags or mesh netting...so if you are looking into buy bulk, it's better spend money at Costco, but if you need just couple of days worth of them, this is perfect grocery store for you. You can always find Organic and Non-organic options, and the seasonal fruits and vegetables are always good.

TJ's carries some ethnic products that you wouldn't necessarily find at most grocery chains. Their ready-to-eat lunch items are very popular, especially their Salads and Wraps, which they rotate frequently, so you know for sure they are fresh. TJ's frozen foods are better than most, and work well in a pinch if you can access a microwave at work or school. Most of their fish is frozen and vacuum sealed, so we don't generally make many seafood purchases, though we have been known to pick up a set of crab cakes from time to time. And while they don't have the largest selection of greeting cards around, they are some of the most inexpensive options you'll find. You can grab a card from the check-out line, or browse their entire selection next to customer service. 
    
Oh, and customer service!  If you can't find something or need help to locate a certain product, the staff will drop everything (gently, and safely) and assist you, all the while, they are doing it with a smile and enthusiasm! 

Parking is plentiful and this store is spacious so it's easy to mosey around the inside the store, without the stress of many other grocery chains.

Beep Beep!!!

Easily the largest pros of Las Vegas begin here, at The Strip. Just as ironic as the lyrics to this song, those pros are nonetheless curtailed immediately thereafter by the inundation of cons that seem to tailgate from behind.

I consider the ""nice thighs & nice waist"" to this ""brick house"" of a stretch in pavement to undeniably be ALL THAT THERE IS TO DO HERE!

I mean, really: WHATS NOT LEGAL ON THE STRIP?!

Oooh, it's the LIGHTS --- ACK'SHUN... Oh, wait. That's Hollywood! My bad. My bad.

Once, while oh, I dunno - some place Strip-side, I trotted out to valet with my super sized Patron margarita in hand. I'd honestly forgotten all about it seeing as how you can even drink inside of Target & regretfully I offered to toss it out but not before the valet driver responded, ""Dude. I couldn't care less if you took it with you or not. I'm just valet & I work for tips!""

THIS ^, ladies & gents, is the LV Strip & damned if my 3D driving experience thereafter didn't just afford this place it's 5th star!

Gone' head Vega$$$!

Notorious for its glitz & glamour, this is truly one of those love it or hate it types of places. When traveling in, no doubt with your paycheck in tow YOU LOVE IT to death, but upon departing, a nicotine stenched, broken down, desert hungover wreck of a hot mess - YOU HATE IT!

From the Luxor with its beaming ray of light that's actually viewable from outer space..... all the way down to Wynn, Caesar's, Mandalay Bay, SLS & the Stratosphere, your Bucket List just isn't complete without a stop off here!

Let's just say that she NEVER RETURNED!!!

Inevitably my fam- and I found ourselves frequenting ""The Strip"" almost weekly and I was more than enabled to explore virtually every hotel, time share and resort that this town had to offer one by one. 

I ain't a hotel whore for nothing y'all & don't even get me on my parent's ""Elvis Wedding"" vow renewal.

Lawd' have mercy...

The funniest thing would be that years later, in terms of entertainment, N-O-T-H-I-N-G  HAS  CHANGED!!! It's just as much of a thrill to visit The Strip now & unlike one's virginity: EVERY TIME YOU VISIT THIS PLACE SEEMS LIKE ITS YOUR FIRST TIME! The adrenaline rush hits you no sooner than the heat does & without a doubt do you know:

------ ITS GOING DOWN!!!

* I've seen Toni Braxton perform on The Strip!

* I've seen Mariah Carey perform on The Strip!

* I even hit up Tao and met Snoop Dee-Oh-Double Geezy here!

* Thanks to the thin single pane windows at SLS, I even heard Taylor Swift perform while overnighting on The Strip!

No doubt, are my memories of this joint insurmountable (& thanks to Magnums, hand sanitizer and morning after pills, those memories don't come with monthly child support payments!)

Yet, ...EACH & EVERY time that I visit, I find myself entranced by all of the new developments, further solidifying the fact that it's IMPOSSIBLE to run out of things to do here!

Prices here surge!

Traffic is a cluster----! 

& the entire vicinity is packed with people....ALLLL in search of additional methods towards TAKING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY, but as we all know, that's the price you pay for life on ""The Strip"".

Ohhh, Strip. Smh. You're such the tease.

From gas prices or plane fare just to get out here, to the price of one's lodging accommodation itself. From there to the resort fee(s) ...pause for a moment. What the heck is even up with that fee? 

Can anyone make heads or tails of it? 

It's 2017 & WiFi should be free. There. I said it. Add to that, the cost of food, the slots & your choice of entertainment & you're left with a reason to mortgage your home OR BECOME THE NEXT LOCAL WHILE SLIDING DOWN A POLE TO REVAMP YOUR ACCOUNT!

Then, there's the cost of tipping.

As it appears, EVERYONE has their hand out. 

The valet guy. The bell man. Room service. You name it. If the slots & the harlots don't successfully 'jack all of your chedduh', I'm willing to wager that one of the above others will & in turn, here's your ""Wheel of Fortune"".

Come here with infinitely stacked pockets, a tetanus shot & an open mind!, & as ALWAYS, do NOT forget to FILL YOUR TANK IN ADVANCE!!!

Cha-ching!

I've never been to the one in Beijing but (a) I have had duck in Beijing, and (b) I've had duck here in Canada (and other places), and this was one of the better ones. Also, the service we got was really attentive/informative and contributed to us so enjoying our lunch. 

Anyway, we were 3 people and got:
- Peking Duck (half portion) with steamed pancakes: This is what QJD is known for and it didn't disappoint. The duck skin was crisped nicely, the duck meat was tender/juicy without being fatty, and the side pancakes had a good neutral taste and were firm enough to hold everything in. More expensive than other Peking ducks I've had but also better.  
- Jelly (in vinegar sauce): Weirdly crunchy. As in, our friend who wasn't eating it commented that it was crunchy because he heard it as we munched haha! Tasted like the regular jellyfish but again, had that weird crunchy texture.
- Mapo Tofu: Great tofu texture but overly spicy taste (and we even had it at less spice).
- Scallion Pancake: This was my least favourite. Heavy and too oily for me.
- Fried Squid (in pepper and salt): This was really good. The squid was cooked well (not rubbery), the coating/batter was light, and the level of seasoning was perfect.

Overall, we had a good experience at QJD. May not be back because of the cost, but definitely don't regret spending to try it once.",2019-02-24 21:44:21

There is a lot of nasty Chinese food in Pittsburgh and the Sesame Inn is better than most, but sometimes it's very, very bad.  I'm talking about the Station Sq location.  The Sesame Inn in Mt Lebanon is consistently delicious.

I do like getting lunch here because it's quick, it can be healthy (shrimp & broccoli), and it's around $10.  I will absolutely be back because man cannot live on Subway 5x a week and there aren't too many affordable lunch spots in Station Square.

Would I drive all the way into town to dine here?  Nope.  

Also, I have seen some kind of strange things here.  One time the two hostesses in the front got into a loud argument in Chinese, and then there was the time I walked by the restaurant and there was a server that was either passed out, napping, or dead at a table right in front of the window.

I'd heard rumblings of this Junction mainstay across the Yelpiverse and was tickled pink when I heard that this was where I'd be dining this evening.

The decor of this place is very laid back with a certain retro sheen to it (namely because of the 1970's living room set up as soon as you walk in). Aside from that its a pretty unassuming place, great stage set up towards the back for live music, a simple bar to the left. Cool place!

Their beer selection was awesome with many varieties I'd not had (or not had in awhile), I opted for something new and I found myself guzzling down a pint of the Hops and Robbers IPA. It was interesting as it had the IPA hoppy finish with a touch of a fruity beginning. Very different and on my list of faves.

Before I get into the menu items we partook allow me to shed some light on a couple of points. First, they have 2 menu's, one is exclusively for their appetizers (all of which are $5) as well as a menu for their entrees. Secondly, there is a curtain about 1/2 way across the restaurant which is pulled off to the side and it's purpose is to separate the full menu side of the restaurant from the appetizer only side. We literally were the first seat on the wrong side of the curtain and the server wasn't going to serve us entrees - lucky for us the head chef and owner were sitting next to us and pulled some strings to have us served. Bonus!!! Thanks again!

The following was shared amongst 3 diners, we all left stuffed!

Appetizers 

Mixed Mushroom Tart - $5 (x2 orders)
- Light and fluffy tart base (just a little crispy) covered with a mix of mushrooms lightly sauteed and seasoned. LOVED IT!

Butter Chicken Wings - $5 (x2 orders)
- Served 4-6 @ a time, these were cooked and sauced in a way that made me salivate more with each bite. Cooked perfectly and covered in butter chicken curry sauce. I literally licked the plate clean!

Field Tomato Salad - $5
- Huge field tomato, green and red, sliced horizontally and done with a mix of what I believe was balsamic reductions and goat cheese mixed in at each level. A generous portion and very fresh on the taste buds.

Crab Cake - $5
- Light and crispy, not over cooked (hate it when that happens). Not overwhelmingly battered or crabby. Another winner.

Entrees
Beef Cheeks - $18
- My first time ever trying beef cheeks and so I wasn't sure what to expect. So tender and cooked/seasoned beautifully. This dish did not last long! MUST ORDER!

Tagliatelle - $18
- Flat Italian egg noodles tossed with a symphony of mixed mushrooms. The portion size was crazy generous and more than one person could comfortably finish on their own. Loved it - so happy when non italian restaurants can pull of italian cooking perfectly 

Compliments to the chef - he was a super nice guy and his menu was amazing. This is a great spot to come with a group of friends and just dine right off the appetizer menu.

Cheat day approved. We always feel hustled at all of the high-price-point Korean restaurants in town. Out of all of the ones we have tried since moving to Las Vegas, Island Style did not let us down. You seriously get a ton of food for your buck and the food actually tastes good. If you are looking for a small portion, or tiny bite, this is not the place to go. 

You will not even believe the portion sizes here. HUGE. Even the banchan (Korean side dishes) were a generous, heaping serving. My boyfriend and I came here with our massive appetites and we were totally defeated. We ended taking home over 60% of the food. That's nuts, even for us. We decided that when we return, we will only need to order one combo plate and share it.

We really enjoyed the authentic Korean banchan selection. The salt boiled peanuts were shockingly delicious. I'm really obsessed with munching on those tasty little guys. Everything else was seasoned and pickled just right; tangy, slightly sweet, and not obnoxiously spicy. They offered - kkakdugi (pickled daikon radish), kongnamul-muchim (bean sporuts), kimchi (pickled cabbage), cold seaweed, and also my absolute favorite was the addictive cheonsachae with mayo (white crunchy kelp noodles). Flavor rating: 5//5

My boyfriend ordered the meat combo plate that was about $12 - Its a crazy amount of food! It comes with 1 Kalbi rib, 1 meat jun, 1 thin breast of BBQ chicken and a big scoop of macaroni salad. We also substituted the white rice for spam fried rice. My favorites were the meat jun and the spam fried rice! We never had meat jun before, but it was so delicious! It's a seasoned hamburger patty covered in a tasty egg batter. The fried rice also had a bunch of spam. The kalbi had great charred and grilled flavor, but 1 rib didn't offer up enough meat; more of a tease. Also the grilled chicken was a tad bland. Flavor rating: 4/5

I really wanted something warm and comforting: a hot and spicy soup would hit the spot. I had my mind on ordering the Soondubu (hot and spicy tofu soup) but I later discovered that they only carry a seafood version, which I was not feeling at the moment. Our waiter was kind and recommended that I try the Yukgaejang (spicy beef and vegetable noodle soup.) I appreciated his tip, so I went for it. It came out steamy hot, the broth hit the spot. It was slightly spicy and very comforting, yet, it wasn't proportional; I wish there was more noodles, after 3 bites I was left with all veggies, some dry meat and a ton of broth. In the future I would definitely  request for extra, extra noodles. Flavor rating: 3/5

The SKIP list:  
* Spam musubi - The spam was sliced paper thin and there was way too much packed, dense rice. I ended up peeling off over half of the rice. Also, the dark, savory and sweet sauce to enhance the musubi was missing. Flavor rating:1/5

* Pan fried mandu, it came out soggy and the filling was exceptionally bland. Unfortunately, the dipping sauce didn't do much to enhance it. Flavor rating: 2/5

As with any move, there were several items that were just slightly nicked and damaged (a curtain rod, the bed nightstand, a lamp shade, and some wall art). We appreciated that the team was clear and upfront about the damage that those items incurred. 

However, after the team left, we found that our flat screen tv was heavily damaged. Careful handling unfortunately was not the case for this item. It was packed and taped by the team, loaded and then unloaded, and then left in a room with the damage facing the wall and tucked behind some other items. This is not a case of the screen being scratched or the case being chipped, this is obvious damage that should have easily been noticed during unpacking. My husband and I found it odd that the team was very upfront about other damage, but the most damaged and most expensive item appeared to be placed away from immediate view without any notice.  

We reached out to Skinny Wimp to see what sort of coverage they offered for damaged items and unfortunately the basic insurance package that we were automatically enrolled in only covered $0.60/lb. No one ever intends to damage an expensive item, but I wish they would've told us that there were other coverage options -moving in and of itself is expensive, let alone having the unanticipated cost of having to purchase a brand new TV due to a bit of the movers' carelessness.",2017-11-06 18:14:56

We finally made it last night. 

I've seen this place promoted so much and I LOVE Italian. 

We got there and had to wait awhile for our table, even with a reservation. The place was hoppin'.
We were sat and or waiter poured our water and ran off. He was clearly very busy. Due to that, we decided to order everything together. We got our appetizer pretty fast. 15 mins later, no drinks. 30 minutes later, still no drinks. We had seen them at the bar, he just wasn't bringing them. After watching him pour more wine for the table next to us twice, we finally asked him to bring our drinks. I hate having to do that. 

Dinner came out and the spaghetti was really good. The hubs got the Pachamama. It was good too, but very little veggies. It was like 1 brussel sprout broken into leaves. So you have a huge plate of meat and fat with nothing to offset. If you're Paleo, keto, etc.-- you're set!

We asked for another round of drinks. My husband asked before I did. Another 30 minutes of waiting and he had to remind the waiter again. 
When these things happen, we pay attention to see if they're waiting on other tables in ample time. He was. So it started to get frustrating. 

I mean, overall, the food was good. But when you have to ask to be waited on, it just puts a bad taste in your mouth. And no matter what, we still gave him 20%. It's hard to not tip well. I have only tipped very low twice in my life. One time being due to the waiter being blatantly rude. Our waiter was not rude. Just very unattentive. 
And when you're paying well over $100 for a dinner, not including your tip, you'd just expect/hope for better service.

The blind/shades expert just stood there, shoulder length blond hair, Russian accent, didn't offer help just looked away.  I had to walk over & ask her, do you work in this department?  

She looked up the 40% off Roman Shades in 47' & we were thrown shade... $311 for one... What?  She said Roman Shades are very expensive, these were also made-to-measure and that it'd take at least two weeks, wtf?  I understand they are expensive, but I am looking for standard fitted ones.  If I wanted to have my whole house fitted for drapes that would be another story, which they've done for us twice so I do understand blinds & shades ma'am.  

We went to Bed Bath & Beyond around the corner & found the most amazing Roman Shades in excellent quality, colors & the blackout was included.  JC Penneys charges more for blackout or room-darkening blinds & shades.

We had:
Shrimp Gabas - whatever was in the sauce was a nice balance of spicy, garlic, and tomato to accent the shrimp.  So good! 
Cuban - best Cuban I've ever had 
Fried chicken w Pork fried rice -  the chicken was the ultimate blend of crispy salty tasty crust with an insanely fresh and tender inside.  Everyone at the table was going bonkers for this one... and I haven't even gotten to the pork fried rice yet.  Absolutely perfect.
Mac n cheese - the waiter told us it was voted best 2x running and I couldn't agree more with those voters.  I normally don't care to order Mac n cheese at restaurants, but I will make an exception here.  Next time I'm putting some sriracha or hot sauce on the top!

Came here during lunch and every seat almost taken, we managed to snag a spot on the patio. Note to staff, heaters aren't needed in AZ when the sunshine is a warm 75. Service was a little spotty for the food but our server was friendly and warm. 

The menu is simple enough with 15 being the lucky number on most items. You have a variety of steam buns, ramen and sushi rolls to salivate over. We opted for the shoyu ramen and fukushu sushi roll. The serving bowls belied the content. The broth is good but not enough to make up for the lack of enoki mushrooms and scantly piece of pork shoulder. It took about 20 minutes before we got our sushi roll which was pretty delish. My belly was disappointed and still hungry. I'll cheer on any new foodie spot, particularly a ramen one.

That's all this review really needs to say, but let me explain the reasoning behind my statement of fact. Hafez is just an amazing Persian restaurant with a menu filled with many different delicious entrees! Between my wife, my son, and myself we average Hafez near once a week to eat. We've been there nearly a hundred times in the past two years between the current location and the old one they upgraded from and it's ALWAYS perfect! The best dish in my opinion is number 20 the chicken skewers which comes with a nice healthy serving of the best perfectly cooked Persian rice, one quarter if an onion, a full roasted tomato, a quarter of lemon, and a roasted serrano pepper. Don't even get me started on the Taftoon bread it's to die for. I would literally drive to Hafez just for the bread and some butter in the morning. Everything on the menu is worth a try.

Nanay's serves stick-to-your-ribs, hearty, comforting food, perfect for a chilly day! We came here around 11 AM for lunch and were the only customers here. As we left a few more people trickled in.

There were a lot of dishes to choose from, with a variety of meat (Chicken, pork, or beef). There was one section off to the side that had some crispy fish. I got a 3 item combination ($9.50) which included a plate of 2 scoops of rice. On the menu board it said soup was included so I asked which soup was part of the meal. The person helping us out said she could give me a little bowl of broth but not the other contents of the soup (Which included some greens and pork) so I'm not sure if soup is actually still part of the combo deal since my friend didn't get any extra soup for her 3 combination meal.

Each dish I had was very flavorful. I especially enjoyed the pork with coconut milk and green beans. Unfortunately I don't know the name of it but it was tasty! The kare kare and dinuguan I also had were enjoyable. My friend's chicken dishes were also quite good and the broth was lovely.

Drinks are by the can or bottle and include bottled water, Snapple, and various sodas. There is also a free-range container of iced water to serve yourself.

Service was good and the person helping us out was warm and friendly. When we entered the restaurant though the music (Tuned to a mix of ""easy listening"" artists like Barry Manilow) was cranked really high up to dance club level volume! They did turn it down a bit once I asked :)

We decided to go on a date night after seeing a movie, so unfortunately we arrived about 20 minutes before the last call for food. We basically had to guess at how much we would want (my poor husband was stuffed at the end). That was our fault though, so not a big deal. 
The food comes quickly and the quality is good. Not great, but still good. The shrimp dumplings are delicious and safe to eat. They are wrapped in rice paper and don't have any sauce. So don't let a waitress tell you they aren't gluten free because they are (I've received yes/no answers so many times on this. I've never gotten sick and would lose my entire stomach over half a pretzel so I know what has gluten). 
They do have gluten free soy sauce but it tasted weird to me. I usually bring my own to be honest.

Their bomb dust fries were real good too.  The setting has a fast-food restaurant feel, but I guarantee those chicken burgers tasted gourmet.  

I am honestly not a big fan of most fusions, because it's a gamble with an individual's perspectives on ""best quality of both world"".  The Korean seasonings, the freshly cooked chicken, the large juicy quantity, and the perfect sides are all great indicators of my perfect fusion.

Also ended up picking up a few goodies, they had the lowest priced cherries at 97 cents a lb, in ok condition. My biggest issue with Sprouts in general is the stores are very cramped and you are constantly moving out of the way or around staff and other shoppers. I prefer doing big grocery hauls for staples at a Fry's or Kroger because it's a more pleasant experience.

DECOR: 5/5
Located in FMP, this place is pretty easy to miss among all the other dozens of restaurants in the plaza. The sign doesn't necessarily stand out but there's people standing outside which means, uh oh, there's a line. The inside decor is surprisingly very nice. The lighting is unique, the walls are decorated. Their chopsticks are even engraved. The only downside is that their restaurant isn't huge, and considering their popularity, you would wish it was bigger.

FOOD: 5/5
Bottomless noodles! There are a few different restaurants that serve this style of noodles, most namely Dagu. I did a bit of research comparing these two brands and apparently Yunshang is way better. The soup was served a unique clay pot, with all the toppings on a tray on the side. I ordered the curry coconut soup and my friend ordered the Tomato. We really liked them both! Despite being an option to add meat for $2.99, there is already a few slices of pork included in the toppings. If you do add extra meat, it'll come inside of your soup.
I also added a squid tentacle skewer for $2.99, which was a pretty decent price and it yummy, but it was soft and not as crispy.
In case you're not full, just ask for extra portions of the noodles and eat to your heart's content! There's plenty of soup to eat maybe two or three portions without running out.

SERVICE: 4/5
It was pretty busy on Saturday during lunch. We got there and were given a number in line, and a menu to write our order, and waited about 30 minutes. It was a nice day so it wasn't that bad. They're also pretty efficient with bringing your order pretty much as soon as you sit down. If you just make eye contact you can ask for extra noodles and theyre pretty friendly about it. The waiters mainly speak Mandarin but they'll accomodate for English too.
They accept cash and debit, but they took my credit card without any complaints/added fee (maybe too busy to notice).

A warm Japanese greeting as we walked in, and seated right away. The decor is very homey, a comfortable and mellow feel. Very nice. 

What ordered:
Arashi Tantan Men
A sesame based pork chashu with egg, spinich, nori, bamboo shoots, mizua, chili oil, garlic, and green onion.

First things first, the richness of the broth is great. If you like a slightly bitter flavor in your soup, this is it. The quality of ingredients used in the soup is top. Together it made for a good soup. Definitely worth a stop when you need that ramen fix.

There are alot more on their menu that we will have to explore, but for now I'm well satisfied. Thank you Arashi.",2019-01-11 19:45:11

Walking around Tivoli Village realizing how small this ""mall"" really is (how disappointing) we were drawn in by the sounds of a LIVE Jazz band... Wait, LIVE and Jazz in the same sentence?! Yessir!!!

I've never known what the difference between a good or bad cigar, but leave it to my husband to teach me! I've NEVER come across a cigar that I was a fan of, NEVER. As I've told my hubs, ""They all taste like Butt!!"" and his response is always ""You've tasted butt?!?! Eww!!"" Ugh, booger. But he selected one Padrón, an anniversary series... Again-- never came across a cigar I liked-- 'til tonight. I now know about that taste that my hubs speaks of! 

Tonight's lesson: my new fondness of cigars + LIVE (capitalized bc the only other LIVE Jazz I've found is at the Cosmo) Jazz Band found locally + the lovely ladies on staff = our new Friday night hangout!!

Why the star deduction? Here it is:
One person, per use-- UNISEX restroom. Call me a ""potty snob"" but I find it pretty damn uncomfortable going in as a person of the other sex is coming out. I'm the only female in my household and growing up my brother and I shared a bathroom... As clean as my guys are, boys are kinda gross. As much as I want to think that the other sex washes their hands, wipes down the seat and doesn't adjust the jewels all nice and raw, I know damn well that they don't. Don't get me wrong, females are disgusting in their own right, but as nice, clean and easy on the schnozzola, it's just an uncomfortable situation for me.

Love, 
The Potty Snob ;)",2013-04-15 18:32:42

Key point here is that the drive-thru was meant to save some time, as we had to get home to refrigerate our groceries. 

Upon ordering, we were told that the tofu would be another 10 minutes. No problem -- that's okay; I've waited for the eggplant tofu before, and on that occasion they were true to their word. This was at 4:33 P.M.

At 4:53 P.M., we were starting to wonder what was taking so long. In what galaxy does eggplant tofu take more than 10 minutes to make? How about even 5 minutes for that matter, being that the demand was relayed through the restaurant. Did they forget? Were they understaffed? We entered the building with the goofy drive-thru flag they gave us, so to ascertain what happened to our [up until this moment] convenient dinner.

A staff member arrived on the scene to inform us that the eggplant tofu would be another 5 minutes. For the wait to reach 25 minutes was already unacceptable, but what choice did we have? 

5 minutes later, the same staff member arrived to say, ""So, the eggplant tofu is done, but now we're out of teriyaki chicken. It'll be 7-10 minutes."" 

What.

I'm still on my health fix, so I wasn't keen on substituting the protein-rich grilled chicken for any other entree. However, we were damn hungry, so I asked to have my meal switched to honey sesame chicken (which I am delighted is back in circulation). Lo and behold, that chicken was also not ready. From the absence of one entree to two, to *three*, the unacceptable level was fantastically off the charts. 

When we finally got our order, we were asked if we wanted a drink for our time. Many thanks, but of course not. A drink? We spent over 30 minutes at Panda Express for an order that we expected to be ready in less than half the time. They were absolutely off-base today, and I received no good explanation as to why. This experience defeated the purpose of the drive-thru, and paired with perishable groceries and wolfish appetites, was the worst of Panda we've seen. 

Bad job. We'll plan on coming back when you've got it together.",2019-11-17 03:10:12

The playground could use some updates but it's still super fun for the kids. I don't see anything broken or dangerous. There is a walking path and a nice rock river. Very pretty, especially after it rains. You can see the water running in between the rocks. It's located next to a school so beware of pick up and dismal, parking can get pretty hectic. 
People love bringing their dogs here so there is plenty of dogs around. They have a large sand area that is intended to be used as a workout part of the park. After school kids take over that so that's also something to consider. There are a good amount of trees around the walking/ running path. They have a small area next to the playground where you can hold a party. It's fairly small and always busy so Maybe look into reserving the area if you want to use it for a party.

The people that frequent this place seem very nice. I've had two bad moments here with rowdy high schoolers. But maybe it's because of the cold but I haven't witnessed that for a while.

No lie, as soon as I entered the place, my eyes went wide and I wanted to eat everything. That probably explains why we ordered a ton of food. I ordered a Soy Garlic Chicken Rice Bowl while my friend ordered The Belly Bombz sandwich. Then we also ordered 6 pieces of Fried Chicken Wings (lemon pepper wet sauce) and Spicy KBBQ Chicken Loaded Fries. I also got a fountain soda of Coke.

It didn't take long for our food to be ready and I was in Korean chicken heaven. Everything tasted so good and the portions were pretty big that we actually had leftovers between us, so I took the rest home. The leftovers also tasted amazing the day after.

I know what you're thinking mostly because I thought it too. So many great reviews, this place gotta be legit. Well one word....BUGS!! Roaches to be exact. Constant bugs. I hadn't picked up a bottle of bug spray in YEARS until I moved here. If you don't like bugs, don't move here. I stupidly trusted the reviews here that said ""no bugs"" (lies!) and ignored the one review here that mentioned this problem (because it was old 2016) and the one Google review that also mentioned it which was recent (but I thought maybe she was crazy because all of these positive reviews). Listen to me and them, this place has a bug problem. Avoid it at all cost. 

I've had the place sprayed, weather stripping reinforced, entry ways covered in boric acid, sticky tape to catch things coming in around the door frame, peppermint oil! You name it, I've tried it! My bottle of raid is almost empty. Again I've only been here a month! Keep in mind its October! I'd hate to see this place in the summer. 

Home should be a place where you can relax. There's no relaxing happening when you have to constantly ensure you have your raid with you at all times. Its safe to say, I won't be renewing my lease.

As I write this there's a huge bug on my living room wall. I'll attach a photo. Its not a great quality photo but its real. 2 others preceded this one this same evening. Who knows whats happening when I'm sleeping or in the other rooms. I can't save myself but there's still time to save you, don't move here.

I love the 90 minute Mars Power Vinyasa with Susan Holmes.  Her teaching style is effortlessly delightful and deceptively difficult at the same time.  Any class with Cristin Bartles is fantastic because of her amazing energy and extremely pleasant and soothing voice.  The 75 minute Earth flow with Dana McCollough is challenging yet fun because of her awesome personality.

Our company had a holiday/cocktail party here.  If I were to assess the entire event, it would have been 1.5 stars, however I don't know how much of it was the planning committee's fault and how much of it was the venue's fault.  

What I liked:  The space was very nice.  It has some comfy couches and is very clean and hip. The music was pretty good as well.

What I disliked: I'm sure our company would have told them we were planning to be there from 6:30-11:30 and we wanted a cocktail party.  If it's a cocktail party, there definitely should be music, but it was blaring all night.  This would be great if it were a bunch of university students clubbing, but the DJ should have thought it through that it is a COMPANY party and people want to mingle for the first few hours.  At least give us 2 hours until 8:30 to hear ourselves talk and then you can blast the music up at 8:30-9 so people can start dancing.  Another dislike was the infrequency of the food.  I probably had about four bites all night at the venue and I was there from 6:30 to 10.  Another coworker and I got so frustrated, we left at 7:30 to grab some real food.  I don't know if this was our company being cheap, but my coworker said he attended a b-day party here and ran into the same situation.  

My last and final dislike was the food.  While I thought the meat was pretty good, why did everything have to be served on a chip, cracker or just be fries?  You could have at least served it on bread.

As an added bonus, they have happy hour everyday all day during the summer and on Thursdays they have $1.50 oysters. They are served with the most incredible horseradish that we may have put on a variety of our other dishes as well....

Their house wines are only $5 during happy hour and taste great- the white paired perfectly with the oysters.

Although the oysters were small, they were flavorful and the presentation was beautiful. Even when we placed a second order for only 4 more oysters (because we couldn't stop after one round), the presentation was the same as if we had ordered another dozen.

The shishito peppers were good and in the past the brussel sprouts have been incredible but we did not order them this most recent time. (on a side note the size of the portions has seemed to get larger over the years- which I'm not complaining about.)

The hamachi serrano chili roll is always a go to for us.

This time we tried the softshell crab sandwich which was delicious (especially when paired with the aforementioned horseradish).

The burger has been great in the past and for $3 it's a delicious and cheap way to fill up.

The scallop ceviche taco was also delicious.

It's hard to go wrong with anything but it'll add up if you're not careful. You can stick to the happy hour menu and get more than a full meal of food and drinks but it'll cost you about the same as many other sit-down restaurants (but with this food being much tastier). The service is a bit slow when sitting in the bar/lounge area but that's to be expected because it's always packed with people who know it's worth it.",2015-08-06 21:58:15

I stopped into Noci Cafe for the first time, glad to see someone in Galileo's old space.  Both the server and a gentleman who I believe to be the owner worked harder than I have ever seen to make sure they were giving excellent customer service.  They both were so nice to me and all the customers, gladly and pleasantly answered all questions and did everything they could to try to meet the Customers' needs before we even knew we needed it.  I ordered at the counter and the server even came around the counter to take my very small order to my table, after asking me what table I want.  They way exceeded my expectations, which I realized have been set by too much time in Starbucks lately.

The coffee was very good and prices aren't bad, especially for the area.

Unfortunately, the croissants weren't very good.  They weren't flaky, were too soft, didn't have a crispy outside.  Not nearly as good as the perfect croissants Galileo used to make, and I was disappointed because we don't have any good bakeries around here and I was hoping we had one again.  If it were just for the pastries this would be a 2 Star review. However, it could just be learning curve and I hope the pastries will improve in time.

I've never been someone that enjoys frozen yogurt as much as everyone else does.  However, when a friend recommended this place to me, I decided to give it a shot on a recent hot day that we had.

Now, before I begin, let me preface this by saying that I have tried other yogurt places in the past. (My boyfriend loves frozen yogurt). Unfortunately, they were okay, albeit sticky, but there was never one that made me crave going back for more.  That's when Aloha Yogurt stepped in to he picture.

The minute I walked in to a CLEAN yogurt shop (SHOCKER!), the owner offered me tasting cups to try out all of the flavors, which was great because I think he has like 8 flavors of yogurt at one time or something.  Plus I am VERY indecisive.  So that was a huge plus.

After deciding that I was going to go crazy, I packed a bowl of cake batter, peanut butter and coconut (All AMAZING).  I wanted to get a bowl of some of the diary free options, but I decided I would save that for another day.  I don't know what it is, but their frozen yogurt just tastes more fresh and more flavor-ful than other yogurt places.  Maybe because most other yogurt places are so corporate and all about the dollar.  You can tell the owner is there for the customers and cares about the flavors right down to the sprinkles.  (Side Note: He told us he is very particular about the sprinkles he gets from a certain vendor because they're more flavorful than most one can normally buy.)  It's that sort of attention to detail that impressed me.

Then on to the toppings. Yes, they have the usual toppings, including some different stuff like carob chips, granola, kashi and mochi (for the health conscious). The brownie is especially good! It doesn't taste like the usual freeze dried brownie parts that most yogurt places include. I LOVE that they have Ghirardelli pumps for chocolate, caramel and this amazing white sauce stuff.  BUT, the creme de la creme is this liquid version of marshmallow fluff that the owner has come up with that is MAGICAL!!! It tastes like liquid marshmallows mixed with the center of Cadbury cream eggs. I wanted to take home a jar of it! Lol...

Lastly, after packing everything in, I get to the counter thinking I'm going to pay a mint for this monstrosity I had created and the price was INSANELY reasonable.  I think the fact that it isn't corporate allows you to pay for the yogurt and not pay money into the pockets of big whigs that could care less about the people.  We talked with the owner and he is a really nice, young, down to earth guy that just seems to love talking with people.  It's little gems like this place that remind me why I love AZ.  ESPECIALLY when I forget, like on a hot day like today. 

By the way, I'm officially a frozen yogurt convert and now I check the Aloha Yogurt facebook page to see the new flavors every day.  : )",2011-03-20 00:48:16

z1CMWPEW2nrUG9jPud7Qfg,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ,lwC0U4xU7T2qyCBRmrWFXQ,3,7,2,4,"I have no problem paying good money for quality things: vodka martinis made with Belvedere, lavish meals with multiple courses, and top-notch electronics, just to name a few. The problem is that I like so many things (good food and drinks, stylish home accessories, traveling to exotic destinations, trendy phones, getting my nails done, cute clothes and shoes, etc., etc., etc.) that I often end up skimping on quality in order to get a lot more of what I want. 

This is definitely true of my approach to shopping for clothes. Of course, if I had unlimited money, I'd splurge on high-end accessories and tailored outfits, but I usually prefer to shop at Target, Express, or Ann Taylor Loft so I have money left over for all the other things I crave!

Because I usually don't shop for designer items at regular stores, I found Last Chance to be both absolutely repulsive and totally intriguing--repulsive because I can't imagine going through that hell to get a designer purse that is probably ripped and/or fake, intriguing because it was my opportunity to get things I've dreamed about having but always dismissed because I'd chosen to make the trade-off between having really high-end shoes and taking a weekend trip. 

For example, I found two super-cute workout tank tops that were Nike and Puma brand. Normally, those cost around $30, which I'd never go for. I just wear my ribbed tank tops instead. However, for $4 a pop, you don't have to ask me twice! I also found a really nice nude-colored slip (to go under my sweater dresses) that I've seen elsewhere for $40. At Last Chance, it was only $6. 

Apparently, Last Chance also offers guys the opportunity to get some trendy and good-looking items without sacrificing other things they care about. According to my husband, who searched extensively in the men's department, the professional clothes weren't great. However, some of the logo/branded t-shirts were ok, and the real steal was the shoes! He got four pairs of Diesel, Puma, and other name-brand sneakers for only about $80 total. Can't beat that anywhere else!

I definitely think that I will return to Last Chance and suffer through the chaotic mess in order to get a few awesome items that I wouldn't ordinarily buy. However, I think it will be a while before I get up the energy to do so again! 

As a side note--Last Chance does accept Nordstrom's gift cards, so if you have one  you may want to check it out. If you're like me, you might be excited at the possibility of getting 10 new things instead of the one you'd get shopping at Nordstrom's.

She ordered the Steak Burger - Pink and I ordered the XXX Burger - No Pink.  We got our food quickly which was a plus.  But when we each bit into our burgers we noticed that they had switched our Pinknesses (is that even a word?!?!).  Mine was ""Pink"" and her's was ""No Pink"".  She was still able to enjoy hers to an extent, but I had to bite around mine until I got tired of eating the edges and told the waiter who can I mention didn't check up on us after taking our order.  

We saw everyone else's waiter much more.  Finally after flagging him down I let him know the issue and he apologized and told the kitchen to cook another one.  By this point, I was already fairly full, b/c the burger edges and the heaping amount of fries was more than enough to fill my tummy.  

I will say that the fries were very good - I'd probably rate them 4 stars.  So all pinkness aside, the actual taste of the XXX wasn't all that great.  It had jalapenos (fresh not pickled); pepper jack cheese, and this mango chutney.  So it's touted to be spicy, but I couldn't discern any real spiciness - the burger was just blah (even after it was cooked to ""no pink"").  I feel like the actual burger should have some flavor to it, not just the condiments.  Condiments should be there to enhance the flavor, not just mask a mediocre main attraction.  

So while I can forgive Diamond for switching our pinknesses - I can't get past the lackluster service and taste.

First impressions of the restaurant itself are ...it's a cute, casual place, I think because of the menu and bar I was expecting a bit nicer place but it's ok, we like our casual spots too.
Service was good, especially considering how busy it was, but several of the servers (not ours) seemed very grumpy with their customers.
All the dishes we ordered were good.  The Eggplant Sorrentina was out of this world and it will be hard for me to order anything else off the menu because it was so tasty.  The menu is quite extensive.  Prices are pretty reasonable.  Garlic bread was just ok.
I think the worst offense was the side salad.  When we asked how much it was to add a dinner salad our server told us $2, so when they arrived we were happy with them.  But actually we were charged $4 each and it is not worth it. I really miss the days when the salad was included as part of the meal.  When you're paying $13+ for a big plate of pasta, $4 is absolutely ridiculous for a tiny dinner salad.

We ordered an antipasto appetizer, a rib eye steak with crushed blue cheese and a seafood crepe, a sundae dessert and 2 alcoholic beverages.  The antipasto was good, leaving a clean, crispy feel in my mouth.  The steak was big and extremely tender yet a tad salty to my liking.  It went down easy.  The seafood crepe was creamy, and it was loaded with small shrimps and scallops bits.  True to experience, the sundae was a knockout.  It was big, sweet, loaded with fudge and whipped cream.  The glass was an ice cream cone lookalike.  So cute.  

I have mentioned that the venue is pleasant.  The interior decoration is romantic and upscale casual.  The section where we sat allows privacy.  The noise level is low.  There is another section that is larger and more open, so big groups will find themselves more comfortable there. The overall package makes this restaurant a good choice for special occasions.",2014-11-30 00:07:05

Part of City Center, the hotel's decor fits with the concept of the entire complex - a modern, high end sort theme.  One of the newer hotels on the strip, the amenities and creature comforts are plentiful.  Each room is fitted with a centralized touch pad by the bed which controls nearly everything in the room - the lights, A/C, TV, and the shades.  The views from the rooms that face the strip are gorgeous, and I was actually really impressed by their closets and bathroom.  Weird I know.  BTW, the in-room wi-fi should be included as part of the resort fee.

The hotel itself includes several bars (one with pretty good happy hour prices!), a club, a dessert/bakery/chocolate/ice cream eatery, to-go food and coffee counters, their buffet, several restaurants, and some retail shops as well (the Crystals mall is right outside the lobby too).  The casino feels cleaner than most by comparison, and I really liked that the air didn't feel thick of cigarette smoke.  Some people might not like the vanilla-ish air freshener smell, but you get used to it quick and it beats the alternative.  I can't describe how nice it is to go back to your room after gambling without carrying the smell of smoke on your clothes.  All of the workers that I interacted with were friendly and nice...especially a couple of the girls working the concierge desk.  So very helpful!  Outside of a doorman who seemed to be having a bad morning, the service certainly made the stay that much better.  

However, being a pricier hotel does have a slight drawback...if you're a gambler at least.  The table minimums for a lot of the games seemed to average higher than what you can find at other hotels on the strip (most were a $25 minimum).  If you aren't a gambler though, it's not going to affect you much.  Still, after the first time I stayed at Aria (with my own room to boot!), I ended up coming back during my most recent trip a few months ago.  I can't compare the rooms to that of the Cosmopolitan or Wynn/Encore, but Aria is pretty amazing!",2011-06-29 06:11:11

I ordered a bowl of noodles with beef and vegetables. I thought it would be more of a traditional soup, but it had far less broth and more concentrated flavour.

You really can't go wrong booking a stay here - hurry up - summer is ending soon!! Great neighboring properties, good buffet, a small rooftop pool, big good smelling casino, thoughtful tower design with central elevators, and super views of Bellagio fountains.

Great nighboring properties: Planet Holleywood, Flamingo/Cromwell, Bellagio, and CP kittycorner. All these neighbors have something to offer and if you spend your whole visit just at these few mentioned mega resorts you will not have missed much. Bellagio has some of the best food and great stuff to look at. The fountains are obvious but also their large indoor garden that they change monthly. Flamingo also has a beautiful courtyard garden with koi fish and flamingos and many pools. Cromwell offers a great nightclub Drais, lounge and a rooftop pool with stunning views of the famous four corners. CP has one of the best night clubs around and upscale shopping. 

Paris has lots to offer too: A small rooftop pool that is generally peaceful and not so over filled which is shocking as there are so many rooms and presumably people with access. I think because it is small many people pass up on going there - perhaps the casino is that good and the guests never leave their slot machines.  Paris buffet is also great. Last time I checked they cut some corners but it is still very good. Crepes are outstanding with their berry syrups.

Casino has good HVAC system - not too much smoke. Rooms are nothing special in terms of square footage of a standard room and decor is dated. Views of Bellagio fountains are possible for an upgrade charge. I like the thoughful tower design with elevators neatly tucked in the middle to reduce unnecessarily long walks. As with any vegas hotel ask for something close to the elevators. In the case of Flamingo there are elevators scattered all over the whole casino floor. I usually ask for a room as close to the parking garage elevator as possible to make leaving that much quicker. Makes sense if you utilize your car and you came with one rather than on a plane. 

There are better options in Vegas but this possilbly one of the best choices if the price for a room is right. Its worth more per night than Flamingo and Harrahs but significantly less than Bellagio. See if you can get a good deal here or neighboring resorts and you will enjoy your stay.",2017-08-16 08:06:11

 I was craving some Greek food and the normal spot I go to is closed on Sundays. I checked Yelp and was convinced to try this place by the number of good reviews. I stopped in and was immediately a little weary because they didn't have much business. There were 3 tables in the restaurant. I went to the register and asked for a menu to place a takeout order. I noticed that the cashier was also the only waiter. After almost a 10 minute wait,  the guy came back and took my order. I got the traditional gyro with beef/lamb and an order of Athenian fries. I paid for my order by debit card and took the table closest to the register. During the 35 minutes it took for me to get my food I noticed the few people walking in not being greeted,  not knowing whether or not to just sit or wait to be seated,  and waiting for anyone to speak to them for 10 + minutes. Meanwhile the one waiter was lounging at the front chatting with the busboy. 

 Any remotely competent server could've handled this small size group with ease. Finally I asked about my food. Turns out my food was sitting on their back counter. I asked how long it was sitting there and the waiter said he didn't know. I opened my bag before leaving and the food was cold. Not having another hour to invest in this place since I paled in the 30 minute parking I just took it and left. 

Don't come here if you're hungry, on any kind of schedule, or you want takeout. You will regret it. Soggy fries and dry gyro meat don't make me want to put up with this again.",2016-01-04 03:22:04

I'm not sure I can go back to plain, boring, French bread now. The chef makes the croissant on point. Each buttery bite is crispy yet soft, and leaves flakes all over the table- the way a croissant should be. They also used a generous amount of pâté, which is great. I enjoyed that a little too much.
I also ordered a bowl of hu tieu. The portion was huge! Broth was great- one of the better bowls of hu tieu I've had in Vegas. Lot of meat too.
The pho, on the other hand, wasn't amazing. It tasted a bit too strongly of star anise. My boyfriend said it was alright, as the size was huge and meat was good.
The chef came out and let us try a new bakery item, the cronut. It was super crispy and warm and sugary. I wished I wasn't so full.
The restaurant also had fluffy pate chaud. I will be back for the croissant banh mis, macarons, & to try the almond croissant that other yelpers praise.

I'd been wanting to stop in for a while, so I was excited to head in after a Pirates game. As you can expect it was PACKED and loud. But I think what added to the loudness was the live band. I know this is going to age me so much, but I did hate to have to scream just to talk to friends. BUT, let's move on to the beer...

The selection is massive and their menu is more like a book. Pages and pages of beers I've never heard of, but want to try! Because it was so packed I went with an old fave, Wells Banana Bread Beer. This place is one of those joints where if you have a hard to find fave, they probably have it. 

It's BYOF, meaning you can bring in your own food. Would be way cooler if there were a few more good options on the North Shore. But I'm willing to ""suffer"" for good beer. And I think it's a cool concept. Why make bad bar good when you can just concentrate on great brews?!",2013-09-04 02:44:50

On regular jogs I'd run past this restaurant and always wish to go in sometime because of the enticing salsa music I can hear from the outside and the quaint-looking heritage building it occupies. But now that I've gone in and sat down, and experienced what ""heritage"" floorboards feel like and sound like without carpet, and how modern dining furniture accommodates the needs of a ""heritage"" sitting room's weird wall partitions and leveling, I think I'll stick to takeout the next time I visit Planeta Mexico.

The guacamole and tortilla chips were outstanding and flavourful. The smooth guacamole had a perfect amount of lemon juice, onion, and salt which I forever fail at getting right when making it at home. The chimichanga was delicious and I preferred it over the fried tacos (tip: if you order the guacamole, order a main that isn't fried so you won't feel so guilty about eating so many fried items in one meal). Sides of beans ad rice were delicious and fresh, and really gives you a sense of homecooked flavours.

Things they can improve in terms of atmosphere: throw a few rugs down so the floors stop vibrating and creaking whenever people walk on it.  Diners sitting in certain locations of this small and open space can feel EVERY SINGLE STEP.  

Customer service: You are a mom-and-pop restaurant and we sense it. But YouTube some basic service manners so patrons don't feel your hostility when they ask to switch tables due to too many floorboard vibes. And if you've decided to hire an employee solely for the purpose of refilling ice water, teach your employee to pour the water jug using the arm FURTHEST from the customer's face!

Went there this past Wednesday night for dinner. Not many people. Service was prompt but too prompt, we ordered an appetizer, side salad with dinner. The appetizer came out and maybe sixty seconds later the salad and dinners came out. Very poor timing in either the waitress or the kitchens part. No courses and as we ate the appetizer our main course got cold. We told the waitress politely, who laughed, maybe she thought we were kidding or maybe it was a nervous laugh don't know. then she walked away, nothing, no I can take that back, or ""sorry"", or ""I can reheat that"". So the next go around we requested to speak with a manager. The manager was nice enough and agreed with us, he offered to take the food back and had them remake it. I must admit I hate sending food back because I am always worried, what if they do something to the food... but it came back and it was remade, not just sitting under a heat lamp. The server came around quite often after that but it was then almost like two often, I timed it and it was about once every five minutes which is great for drink refills but every time she asked if we were okay and that was a bit much as well. I kept reminding myself better too much service than not enough but it would have served her well just to observe that if we are talking and eating it is okay not to make a comment every few minutes. I read once that the best service is the type that everything is taken care of and you don't realize the waiter is there - and I have had this and it is awesome, but not here. 

So other than the poor service; the food was decent. I tried something different this time and got the two meat platter with pork shoulder and burnt ends. I have never had burnt ends before but have seen it on Food Network. I don't think that this was what is typically called burnt ends it was more like chunks of meat with a lot of fat, but they were good rib pieces. I am always a fan of the pork shoulder. Our appetizer was good, smoked wings, good smoke flavor and not dry; and we shared BBQ nachos those were good as well. Lots of meat on the nachos, which is appreciated. 

All in all, I always have liked Memphis but it may be awhile before I decide to go back there.",2011-09-25 17:40:18

The consensus that I've heard was that the place was fantastic and had great wine.  We had a Groupon $20 for $45 which is always featured so I recommend that because why wouldn't you if its there and your going to dine there anyway.

Immediately when you walk in your eyes are drawn the candles that are lit everywhere and directly in front of you is the redish orange unique chandallier.  Pretty neat.  Ambiance just punched you in the face. I had been here before this became Mezzos and don't remember the details as much as I did this time.  The ceiling is dropped down creating a circled effect which I thought added a lot of character to the place.  To your right is a little sectioned off party room/section that would be good for a large party.  To the left is the bar area which I really didn't get to check out closely being that we were seated on the other side closer to the kitchen.  

The server and guy assisting him were fabulous, attentive and very nice.  I believe the owner was there, however he never greeted us. 

I ordered my glass of Chardonnay and they didn't have my first choice.  Soo I ordered my second choice.  It wasn't too shabby but $10 a glass.  I hate the mark up on wine sometimes. The BF was disappointed they didn't have mixed drinks so he just ordered a soda.  

The bread came out right away.  Reminded me of some bread that I make at home.  Crusty on the outside and doughy on the inside....warm and delightful.  It accompanied a small bowl of oil and balsalmic.  Too much oil for my taste.  I kinda like more of the balsalmic but it was still really good.  We ordered the Caesars salad to share and it was perrrfect.

For my entree I ordered the penne ala vodka with chicken as an add-on.  It came out and looked amazing.  There was way too much chicken though - SAID NO ONE EVER - except for ME!  Sorry.  I like more noodles and a hint of chicken.  There was a lot of chicken and a lot of sauce.  All was tasty to say the least and 1/2 went home for leftovers.  BF ordered the chicken parm with a side of penne with marinara.  This was ALOT of chicken too but he wasn't complaining.  It almost felt like 3 portions...no kidding.  Needless to say we brought some of that home as well.

Overall a great experience.  Ambiance is a 5.  It has outdoor seating that would be amazing to enjoy if it wasn't over 100 degrees outside right now.  I think with our Groupon we only spent $15 over that.  Nice little date night and a definite need to go back and bring friends!

The kids, and adults, just can't get enough of this place. To top it all off, they even have rotating presentations here @ the IMAX theater. They have had the planets and the yellowstone one that were particularly memorable. I watched the Normandy one, and it was alot of fun, in spite of the children that could not contain themselves.

We are from Dallas Texas, where you can throw a rock up in the air and it will probably land on a taco joint. Since we are new to Cleveland, and haven't found much for authentic Mexican cuisine, my husband and I were thrilled to hear about Barrio. Today we tried one of each of the brunch tacos, as well as chips and salsa and guacamole. The chips were super fresh! And this place even gave us chip refills without us needing to ask. They are not stingy with the chips! Pretty good salsa as well. The brunch tacos seemed rather experimental. The chicken and waffles taco was not as good as expected.. mainly because of the collard greens. The salmon taco was weird but.. I mean.. what do you expect ordering a salmon taco? My husband thought it was exactly what he expected and he liked it. I enjoyed my other two brunch tacos of huevos rancheros and huevos con machaca. They could have been warmer and had a little too much sour cream for my taste.. We will definitely return to try the regular tacos! I also loved the atmosphere! Really cool walls and decor overall. 

One suggestion: soft corn tortillas would be much appreciated and make these tacos more authentic. So far, soft corn tortillas seem to be hard to find in this part of the US.

We arrived around 8:55 and waited outside for a few minutes before they opened.  The wife went with the Monterey, which has bacon, egg, peppers, tomato, cheese and onions.  I had the Sunday Morning (eggs, potatoes, cheese) and added bacon.  I'll be honest, I had no idea how big these things were, and I was worried we wouldn't have enough food.  So, we decided to get a William Tell to split.  Plus, we wanted to try one of the sweet ones.

Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  These things are HUGE, such a good value for what you get.  We brought nearly half of the wife's home, and that was with me eating some of it.  These come out very hot, which is appreciated.  No sitting around for these crepes, you get them fresh.  I loved mine with hot sauce.  Lots of cheese and crispy bacon.  I probably liked the wife's a little more, the veggies mixed with the eggs became basically like a salsa.  Again, there was a lot of cheese, which is a fantastic thing.  I think in the future I'll get the Monterey and add potatoes, that will probably be the perfect crepe.

The William Tell was fantastic, basically a nice apple pie crepe.  Again, it was enormous, so we didn't finish it.  I loved the caramel and powdered sugar on top.

First of all, what bothered me most was the price. I tried the Yang's in Vaughn and could understand that it aims to be high-end and matching in quality, but unfortunately the AYCE Mississauga location does not live up to that expectation.

First of all, there are some pros. The sashimi was generally fresh, although limited in choices (probably because it opened at the time) but took a long time before it was served to our table. The garlic stir fried beef tenderloin was also the highlight of the meal as it was salty deliciousness that my friends continued to order.

Now the bad occurs: the menu is very limited in terms of specialty rolls yet they charge a premium price. They don't even have spider roll, which I have seen at every other AYCE restaurant for cheaper prices. I was very disappointed that for a restaurant that decorated itself to be upscale, it lacked menu options and creativity in sushi rolls. Service was a bit slow despite being one of the only customers in the restaurant. It was like a Friday night, and when I went, only half of restaurant was lit and barely filled. It was pretty shocking because dinner time is usually peak period and there were barely any customers.

Lastly, one of the managers or someone higher up came to our table twice to ask if we enjoyed the food... which made me feel uncomfortable because it felt like they were fishing for a compliment. Lo and behold, when we said the beef tenderloin was good, he went into pretentious mode and bragged that the sauce they used and how they prepared it was special, etc. and honestly, I just felt like it was a pathetic attempt to 'win' customers on how great the food is by appearing to casually engage in conversation.

To add insult to injury, they add automatic tip... I know many other places do this, but that doesn't mean I agree. In this case, no matter how poor their food or service is, they still get their minimum tip's worth. 

Sadly to say, I have not been back and will not revisit, unless they drastically decrease their price or have vastly improved their service/menu. Otherwise, there are still plenty of AYCE sushi places in Mississauga that I would choose above this.",2012-07-16 03:55:27

Unfortunately, my experience echoes much of what other reviewers have already expressed. I found Blowfish's fusion offerings to be very much lost in translation. Dimly-(mood?)-lit with a very modern feel, with wooden tables beautifully burned/carved depicting koi fish, with a very distracting instrumental music blaring in the background. Service and staff seemed very nice. The same cannot be said for much of the food. The ""special"" rolls, that we thought we'd order to try something that cannot be had elsewhere, were a bizarre application of spice that only served to obscure the flavour of the main protein of the sushi (such is the case with the Red Hot Curry Salmon roll)---I guess to be fair, we weren't sure what to expect (deaddovedonoteat.gif). The nigiri were average at best and uninteresting overall. The only exception was the foie gras tuna for which is probably their saving grace. An interesting decadent bite of rich, fatty, and savoury, the foie gras tuna was worth ordering a second. For me, Blowfish comes across as a sushi-avant-garde-wannabe with a selection that seems to be a collection of ideas that sound good on paper, but should remain on paper. The disparity between the quality of their food and their overall aesthetic is only exacerbated by the accompanying price tag. At this range, I would look elsewhere.",2017-03-27 00:43:48

I was pleasantly surprised that such a small restaurant would have a stage for someone to play live music.  Alas, this wasn't a night of scheduled performances so the stage was left empty.

The Guacamole Ranchero was a traditional mashed avocado dip served with tortilla chips and salsa.  This arrived with some of the tortilla chips placed separately in another basket.  Meanwhile, the mashed avocado dip was a really big portion surrounded by a select few tortilla chips which made it look like a beaming sun.  It was a neat way to serve the Guacamole Ranchero. 

I felt that this Guacamole Ranchero was a little too sour for my taste.  There was a lot of tomatoes, lemon juice, and onions in it for sure and they sure didn't skimp out on the avocado either.  The tortilla chips were extremely crunchy and crispy.

All of their entrées were served with Mexican rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo with a choice of green (mild), red (medium), or aztec (spicy) sauce.  I chose the Enchiladas.  I chose medium heat for my sauce.  The Enchiladas included three rolled tortillas stuffed with a choice of chicken, beef, pastor, veggies, steak, fish, or shrimp.  It was served with mozzarella, sour cream, and feta.  For my order, I chose fish.  The red sauce turned out to be a little spicy, with the heat lingering for a little while after the first bite.

The refried beans were pretty good.  I especially liked how there were a few tortilla chips stuck into the refried beans which not only made its presentation a nice one but also the chips were thus warmed up and less crunchy as a result (the chips were actually too crunchy for my taste).  The tomatoes in the pico de gallo were fresh.  I found that the Enchiladas were a little soggy especially with the already soggy-tasting fish inside the rolled tortilla.  Otherwise, I did like the mozzarella and sour cream on top of it.

The Taco a la Parrilla also was served with Mexican rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo with a choice of sauce.  This entrée included three soft tacos stuffed with a choice of chicken, beef, pastor, veggies, steak, fish, or shrimp.  K chose shrimp for this one.

This plate was again very colourful and I loved the look of it.  I enjoyed the shrimp in the tacos in this one more.  The shrimps were grilled nicely and had some flavour to them.  The soft taco shells weren't to my liking; I found them too soft and grainy.",2017-04-07 21:20:22

Those businesses we quite unsuccessful. I'm thinking it's based on the location. One thing that Milestones did well was create a beautiful patio. With their daily drink specials they should do relatively well in the summertime.

So we want to Milestones on a Thursday evening and once we arrived there were no more tables available in the patio. We dined in the dining room. Our server who we won't name, wasn't that great of a server, not to us anyways. We first received our waters and my glass had black particles in water so I got a replacement. She was not giving us much attention. The experience that she was providing to us was not very engaging. As much as I pushed to initiate conversation she was not very interested in making small talk. When we received our food and started eating she did not once ask how our food was or if there was anything else we needed. Being a server in the past, I know that's the basics of what u should be asking. 

As for the food that we ordered it was pretty good. The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries. Only issue I had was the portion of fries that I received, it looked like someone in the kitchen ate half my fries before serving it. Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate.

We were greeted and seated right away by a friendly face. I liked how it was clean, modernly designed and not crowded. The waitress gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. She could tell we were new, so when taking our orders, she gave us a few recommendations that we might like. Quite knowledgeable about their menu. 
The nice part is when she walked us through how to eat the dishes properly, instead of letting us act all crazy and just put everything in the hot pot. LOL. I bet that would've been hilarious, but man... I certainly would've felt dumb. 
It was cool of her to check up on the brother, making sure he had enough broth in the pot for the entire meal. She'd also turn the little stove area down notches once in awhile to keep the stuff from boiling. At the end of the meal, she put our stuff together to bring home, which was pretty much the fixings of udon. 
I had the Samurai portion of the Prime Rib with Spicy Miso, Brown Rice, Ponzu and the Swisher Sauces. The brother had Pork Combo Plate (also comes with Yojie Cut Angus Beef) with Sukiyaki, Pasteurized Egg and White Rice. I like me some Prime Rib, but I wish I had ordered what my brother got. The pork just went so well with the broth, then dipping it into the egg. For dessert, we both had the Ramune Float. Yummy citrus sweetness.

After trying a few of the latest ramen hotspots and being rather disappointed, this was a total success! My biggest beef with all the new ramen places is they end up being more about trend than taste. This, however, was some top notch ramen. 

First, the noodles. So fresh and so good. You can literally admire them being made right next to you while you devour your bowl. And they make different varieties, so depending on the ramen broth you choose, it'll be paired with a different noodle type. I had the miso, which came with a round slightly fatter noodle, while my husband had the Shoyu, which came with a skinner noodle. Both excellent by the way. 

One of my favourite parts about this place was that you get to choose from all the classic ramen broths. They have both chicken and porc based broths, which is rare as most places tend to specialize in one or the other. I can't comment on the porc ones, but the miso and shoyu were both excellent. 

And finally the porc pieces were generous and tender, without being overly fatty.

It makes your food more enjoyable but expect this place to have inconsistent  textures and flavours as this place is quite relatively new. Their oyster bar is a one up.

Food (2.5/5)
Oh how far you've fallen since when I first met you. This place had great promise, great flavours, and wonderful dishes. As time grew up they began to revert their unique salads to what it seems like lettuce out of a bag and sauce out of the bottle to save time and money probably. Their seafood was perfect but they seem quite pre-boiled and kept in a heating compartment, either that or the seafood they get now is that bad. The cajun fries are ok, the sweet potato ones are better (extra $$$). The sauces have went from HELLA SALTY WITH A HINT OF FLAVOUR to a little less salty. Ormaybe I've been coming back too often now that my tastebuds have gotten used to the salt? Not quite sure anymore.

Oyster bar (4/5)
Quick, clean, fresh oysters. I knocked off a point cause of the lack of sauces but it isn't their main attraction anyways.

Alcohol (3/5) 
Quite the variety with my favourite Side Launch Bavarian Wheat Beer, they even have an 11$ special thay features 4 or 5 beers that are all 5 oz so you get to taste what they have on tap, great idea! But nothing too flashy as they don't do cocktails (lmao why this is so sad hire a bartender for the love of the Oyster Bar).

Atmosphere (3/5)
It's definately going in the direction of a fisherman's sports bar with all the cute decor ranging from giant crabs to little shipping containers for your napkins and lighthouse lamps. However the music is dreadful. It's basically a Spotify playlist on Canada's Top 50 or someones EDM playlist that I CAN LITERALLY NAME EVERY SONG. This is a place for either every basic raver's dream who's life career is fishing.

Service (5/7)
These waitresses are absolutely lovely, so far I only see one familar face everytime I go and unfortunately I do not like her (sorry) or the guys. I quite frankly dont think they even interact with customers ever (I'm talking about the dudes) as all the times I've gone they're usually just hitting on the girls and then runaway to the kitchen or bar when a customer approaches them; worst case scenerio a customer talks to them and it's the same old line ""let me get someone to help you :) and bashfully skid away in their adidas sneakers. The other unfamilar faces that come and go however are very delightful beauties who are very sweet and nice. Wishing you well ladies!",2017-08-07 22:01:25

In our group 3 people decided to split one, but there are signs everywhere saying there is no knives available, and they won't cut it for you.

Randy is so warm and welcoming.  He is an excellent host and clearly loves what he does.  This is the kind of place that you want to come back to over and over again simply because the owner puts his best foot forward and does all he can for his patrons.

I visited China Magic Noodle House with mixed expectations, but an open mind. The reviews are on the spotty side, but I really wanted to try their hand pulled noodles. 

Once I found the restaurant (on the back side of the building) I was immediately pointed to a nice booth by a smiling server and brought water and a menu. I had heard that the lemon tea was good, so I ordered it and settled in to consider the menu.

I had brought a few suggestions from the reviews I had read, and after some consideration, although I knew it was too much food, I decided on the dumplings (pot stickers) and the #34 XO Sauce Beef Noodle Stir Fry so that I could try more than one thing. I only had to wait a couple of minutes for the server to return with my lemon tea (wonderful!), and to take my order. When asked about the heat level of the heat of the XO sauce, the friendly server indicated that it was a little hot for her, but that they can tone it down to be sure it was not to hot for me. I agreed to that.

The dumplings came out first, and fairly quickly, but were a huge disappointment. They didn't look very good and I could tell without touching them that the wrap was dry. The wrap was tough, and where it wasn't tough it was hard. I initially tried to use chop sticks to pick one up, but it was large, heavy and awkwardly shaped. I tried to cut it with a fork I had been brought, but in was too hard to cut. I gave up and picked it up and took a bite. Even that was a bit of a challenge because along with the toughness of the wrap, the meat inside was very densely packed. I tried dipping it in the accompanying sauce, but it wouldn't absorb any of it. Granted, it was a large serving (8 dumplings) but inedible and not very tasty. I didn't even finish the first one. This was starting to look like a bad idea.

As I decided to give up on the first dumpling, my #34 was brought to my table. It smelled great, and was a HUGE portion. As I blended the ingredients together, it felt to me that the dish needed a bit more moisture to keep the ingredients from sticking together. I also realized that the noodles were extremely long and that I had forgotten to order them shaved (easier to eat), but that was my bad. 

The dish was, however, delicious. The meat was tender and tasty, I really liked the noodles, and that they still had a slight chewiness. Per my request, the dish was spiced to a perfect heat level for me. The heat was present, but not overwhelming. My HUGE serving had a nice balance of noodles, meat, bean sprouts, carrots, etc. Eating the unshaved noodles was awkward, but I didn't let it slow me down. I only managed to eat about 1/3 of the dish. 

I was provided take-out boxes and a plastic bag (helpful), and for what reason I don't know, I took even the awful dumplings with me. I later tossed the dumplings, but found the noodle dish reheated well in the microwave given several minutes at power level 4 in a covered microwave dish.

Overall, I'm glad I came and plan to return again because I loved the hand pulled noodles and lemon tea. I will not be having the dumplings. I still want to try the Ox Tail Soup, and the Noodles with Minced Pork.

I rated this as 4 stars instead of 3 because it is interesting to see the noodles made while you eat, my main dish was REALLY good, and I received prompt friendly service.",2015-07-16 05:45:54

The fries weren't great. They were just ok. Once my granny got her cheese she said her food was good too. My pastrami burger was massive and tasted good, but it was just an overwhelming combo for me.

Le Cirque is a beautiful dining room overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Our table was next to the window so we had a great view. 
The service is incredible and friendly, but the food, I've had better. 

On the menu you will definintely find decadent choices with both appetizers and entrees. They also have an excellent wine list. 
After a few questions about the menu we ordered.

Our appetizers arrived. I had the crab salad, which was a lite salad topped with hearts of palm, caviar and spinkled with pomegranate seeds. Nice and fresh tasting. One of the ladies in my party had the fois gras which she said was very good, another - escargot which she said was good. However 2 of us got the lobster and avocado salad, which the lobster was so tough it was hard to cut. 
When we mentioned it to our server, two men came back to our table, one remarked it must be our knife. (Really? not the response I expected) Uh.. no it's tough.. Since this is what I ordered for my entree, I asked if I could change my order to the Hamachi, they said no problem. 

Our entrees came, two of the ladies did enjoy their sea bass and black bass. However the sea bass presentation could have been better, It was wrapped in potato with a brown sauce.. (brown & white only on a plate, not too appetizing)
Another ordered venison, which she said was good, and another had the lobster risotto which she said was great.  The himachi I had was good, it sait on two pieces of avocado which were topped with rock salt, which was a bit much. Again it had heart of palm which was great. 

They do say save the best for last and it was with dessert. I didn't order anything but 3 of the women got the chocolate ball, which I tasted. Rich dark chocolate poured over 3 to 4 different decadant chocolates. Beautiful presentation. 

Again, the atmosphere nice, the service great, but the food?? For the price, I expected it to be one of the best meals I've ever had. With melt in your mouth food.  Unfortunately, I've had better.",2013-01-27 17:53:05

It's the only breakfast dish I've tried that deserves a repeat performance. The edges of the waffle are a little crispy and the middle is a soft, slightly chewy texture. Do not bother trying the chicken sausage, not good. Very greasy and the texture is kind of gross. I don't know how else to describe it but I spit it in my napkin so I think gross about covers it. Just trust me and order the waffles.

I've had the southwest burger as well. It comes with green chili's, pepper jack cheese, guacamole and a pretty good chipotle mayo. I don't eat cow so I sub in a turkey burger. It's not the best turkey burger in Vegas but it'll do in a pinch. A little dry but it usually is in comparison to a beef patty.

The service is slow and very consistent. It's always slow. Always. I know this going in though so I don't sweat it.

There are two types of bbq sauce: mild and spicy. The mild was a good balance of sweet and tangy. The platter comes with two sides. I doubled up on the greens which were flavored with potato, seasonings and shredded chicken mixed in. The hubby had beans and coleslaw. The beans were excellent while the coleslaw was very mild.

Rock 'N'oodles is definitely one of those good finds! I don't live or work anywhere near downtown and would have probably never seen it otherwise. It's a small building right off Charleston on 3rd Street that would be easy to miss if you were driving by. The restaurant itself is very small and can only seat about 12 people plus a couple outside tables. I love the décor though, it's simple but awesome with an entire wall covered in great albums they've got in really cool little frames.

When it comes to the food, you'll quickly realize why it's called Rock 'N'oodles. All the dishes are named after songs like Great Balls of Fire, Californication & The Devil Went Down To Georgia, just to name a few. Two of the ones we've tried so far now are Buffalo Soldier and Sweet Home Alabama...which I can only describe as versions of mac 'n cheese on steroids! The Alabama is a gouda macaroni topped with popcorn chicken and BBQ sauce with some bacon and onions tossed in. With the Buffalo Soldier you get blue cheese macaroni with carrots and celery topped with buffalo chicken. Now, like I said...steroids! Flavor is spectacular in both, pasta is cooked perfectly and each bite just keeps you wanting more! 

I've noticed some reviews mention small portions. I can only assume the owner/management are paying attention because these are definitely not small plates. We've also tried Born On The Bayou and Paradise City...I was only able to finish my entire plate once. On top of that, the customer service is great and even after my son accidentally spilled his Sprite all over the counter, we were met with smiles and a friendly attitude! Prices aren't bad either, with the most expensive dish coming in at about $12. This is a must try spot!",2014-01-17 06:07:33

I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.

We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  

My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  

In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.

A new-age southern style restaurant in the heart of Venetian.   Quite a few exemplary choices here, just with the strip prices you'd come to expect.

Let's start with one of the best Fried Chicken dishes you may encounter :

Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles ($36): Honey Hot Sauce, Chilled Spiced Watermelon, Cheddar Cheese Chow Chow Waffle & Bourbon Maple Syrup. The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition!  A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion.

Mama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended!  I could eat these biscuits for days :D

Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! 

Fried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. 

Fried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable!

Deviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish

Chicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. 

Florida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus 

Macaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese.

Country Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. 

And for dessert :

Key Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding / mango jelly, light and delicate.

Crunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like.  A bit too sweet for my tastes, but one can figure that out reading the ingredients.

Bacon Butterscotch Cake: Pecan Pie Filling & Bourbon Ice Cream. Delicious cake, fair bacon flavor throughout, with a very crispy bacon piece for garnish. Good! 



Stick with the fried chicken, biscuits and cornbread concoctions, and you will fare well!

The crispy roll wasn't crispy, more... the opposite of crispy.

The entire process was seamless, and it was evident it was in the societies best interest to make sure these lovable pets find the right home.  

I first went in to see a couple of puppies, and I really like 2 in particular.  Because I already have a dog at home, and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me, I put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later.  It is required that if you already have a dog, you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match.  My dog loved Sayuri, but was not as fond of the other dog.  I like to say that my dog chose our new puppy :).  

When adopting a puppy, you also recieve a free exam through the VCA Animal Hospitals.  I think that's wonderful since adopting a rescue dog can be intimidating.

Take the order, deliver the food, that's it.

Most truffles I have eaten do not have coloring, they are simply flavored within the chocolate.  We were highly disappointed and I actually only tried one bite of each and then did not eat anymore.

With my Miso, I had green onions, corn and takana mustard leaf! The taste was flavorful and decadent with a touch of spice! 

The following week, I ordered my Miso with my favorite noodle along with my extra vegetable components just like my last visit but forgot to add the mustard green. I swore up and down to the chef that they gave me Tonkatsu because Miso was spicy last time.  Well, after a discussion with the chef we realized that the takana mustard leaf presented the spicy flavor to the broth, which was forgotten!

The tables are very long, so people have to sit side by side, very close to one another. I find this kind of annoying as there isn't much privacy, but what can I do. I just suck it up. Along the back, by the big windows, are more private tables and seats. I think there are a longer line ups for those areas, as many people want privacy as well. 

When you are seated, your table mat, which is also your menu greets you. As you can see, the restaurant's menu is very long, but that's probably only because it is on one piece of paper rather than the book that we are more used to.

Personally, we love eating curry, fried rice, and their seafood dishes here. Every time I tried their noodles, I had some difficulty finishing it because it was't up to par with the other dishes.

Aside from the menu, you can modify the spiciness to your dish to make it as spicy or non-spicy as you like it to be. In addition to the chilis, you can ask your food to be made gluten-free or vegetarian depending on whether the option is available. Look for the appropriate images beside the menu to see if it's available.

Spicy Mussels:
This is one of our favourite seafood dishes. We added 10 chilis to it, which made our waitress raise her eyebrow. :D For us, it was quite spicy, giving our noses a little kick, but it was bearable. Aside from the spice, the dish was full of basic vegetables (onions, carrots, peppers) and the muscles were cooked well. The sauce itself was spicy and sweet... that's all I kind of remember about the dish. Eaten with the rice, it was enjoyable, especially for its price.

Panang curry:
This is by far my favourite dish in the restaurant. Golden in colour, the curry is perfect with a bowl of rice. I added a few more chilis to make it a total of 5, and it was perfect for me. The coconut milk that they used in the curry balanced out the spiciness, making it not spicy at all for our tastes. I like panang curry over the other types of curry because it has a bit of every taste in it. Spicy, sweet, and savoury all at the same time... I get all my favourite flavours in one bowl! I've tried many Thai curries from various restaurants, but for some reason, this one at Salad King still remains on my top 5 list. That says a lot!

If you're looking for a cheap but well tasting Thai restaurant in the area, try Salad King! Make sure to call ahead to make a reservation if you don't want to wait and/or want a private table.",2015-03-18 18:04:19

Staff  were warm and attentive;  you imagine your at a friend's Estate and all the staff have been instructed to treat you royally, and we were.

Food at T. Cook's  honestly was for the price and everything considered  a 3.5 which ends at  a 4 star average because of the service. 

We did the $99 summer 3 course meal:

I ordered a Cherry blossom cocktail  $12. I was imagining this to come out in some hip glassware with  some kind of cool cherry blossom fruit/flower flair, but no just a normal glass, kind of like you would get any average place.
 Wow the description of the cocktail had me thinking up something divine. Ok back on point,,,
Bread:  Served Warm, toasty (it better be, this is one of  my pet-peeves, it must always be W/T. It was.
 Served with delicious, outstanding pesto. 

I ordered the crab cake for my 1st course and it was good;but it is contending with Crab cakes I've had in Maui at Mama's Fish house. Beach Vs Desert crabcake? It isn't a fair match but a definite honorable mention for desert contender. Regardless I've still got my Cheshire cat happy face on.

2nd course : Neiman Ranch Pork CHop with balsamic glaze. 

Excellent cut of meat ,tasted like steak, but for me the glaze was a little salty. 
This was accompanied by baby carrots & Potatoes Anna, my carrots were kind of hard I really had to pin them down to get a bite prepared. 
I was wishing I had Lorraine not Anna on the potato front; mine were kind of  bland. 

Dessert : Chocolate truffle ganache cake,HOME RUN!! OUTSTANDING!!!!!

Total Bill w tip included $175.  Summary, Considering the overall value and we went here on a gift certificate I might  feel compelled to remove a  star if on our own dime/ dollar. but again customer service was outstanding so I think overall you pay for that and it did make for a special occasion, so verdict remains!

Tons of folks come from all over to sample NC wines, enjoy some great local music, and enjoy a day in the park. Had the pleasure of spending the day at this event this past weekend. Here's my take:

Pros:
The wine selection is fun. I'm not the biggest wine connoisseur in the world, but it is fun to go around to the different wineries representing and sample some of their products. 
Food is definitely worth getting if you intend to spend a gratuitous amount of time at the park. This year, Southern Cake Queen and Roaming Fork were there. Also, they had the epitomized ""fried food stands"" that seem to make it out to every festival in town. 
Symphony Park is such a fun spot. Glad they have it here. It had a lot more character, and shade, than some of the other grounds around Charlotte. 

Cons:
Security. These guys seem to only be ""warm bodies"" at times. So many people were walking around hammered and some were even tampering with vendors' stations. Not exactly a good mix. 
Hours of the festival are a bit long. I think a 5-hour festival is the max it should run. 8 hours allows people to get a little sloppy. 

All in all, I'm glad this festival is in Charlotte. Hope it gets better next year!",2012-10-08 13:04:24

Using the trusty and painless Yelp app, I sought 5 or 6 quotes, most of whom responded promptly, but none were as thorough and polite as Selma with The Cooling Company. She called me directly and clearly explained the various services they offer, including different membership packages.

Based on my honest and informative communication with Selma, I felt confident choosing their company for a tune up and diagnostic service for my equipment. That confidence was well placed as their technician, Joe, was equally friendly, thorough and competent. The work was performed quickly and the difference in A/C performance is night and day. He also recommended preventative services and provided quotes for future reference.

As for the burrito, it's rare that a place can throw potatoes in and have them be light and fluffy, but these guys pulled it off. 

Were it not so far from my house I'd be in more often, but maybe that's a good thing for my waist line. If you're in the area give it a try!

I have severe allergies unfortunately and have had to come here a few times for steroid shots when my face swells and so forth. The've always been great with me.
Yes, sometimes there is a wait, but if there are tons o' people, that's how it is.  One time I came in with swollen lips and and eyes and they immediately saw me for fear I would go into anaphylactic shock, so they DO treat those who need immediate attention first.

However in May/June I went to Thailand and developed severe hives all over my entire body.  A sketchy Thai doc gave me a 'steroid shot' (still have no idea what the hell I actually got shot up with) and they actually got worse.  So after 30 hours of flying, I had my Uber bring me here immediately.

Walked in, freaking out, miserable, itching, and looked diseased.  The receptionist asked me what I needed, I showed her my hives and she immediately got me cold compress bags to put where I could.  When she saw my big huge backpack (I really did come straight from the airport), she asked about it. When I said I just landed  from Thailand, she immediately brought me back to a room. I laughed and told her I didn't have some funky Thai disease, but I was having a severe allergic reaction  she laughed and said ""no no, let's just put you back here"". 

Fine by me.

The doc came in immediately and agreed it was a severe allergic reaction.  Gave me my Medrol shot and my steroid prescription.  And laughed at the fact that I brought In-n-Out with me, but whatever. ;) 

These folks have always been great.  Have I had to wait before? Heck yes, but it's an Urgent Care....  Tip: just say you were in a third world country and you get in immediately. :)",2015-06-21 00:51:52

She's not a big fan of gorgonzola so ordered something else, but this time it had a saffron cream sauce that was beautiful. I had the pappardelle mimmo, which was heavenly. Fork tender scallops, lobster, asparagus with butter, sage and truffle. If it wasn't a nice restaurant I'd lick the plate. We started with the mozzarella with parma prosciutto over arugula salad.

The building itself is quite magnificent. It's the type of place you kind of want to take prom pictures at before they yell at you for loitering. The interior is so chic and modern. I almost convinced my mom to let me redesign my room the same way.

We were seated in a booth and gave our drink orders. The drinks did not take long at all. We don't usually get an appetizer but how could we say no to Prime Rib Yorkies? They sounded so cute and delicious. We also both ordered the Prime Rib dinners which came with salads to start. I got mine with the baked potato as the second side. My friend started off with a Caesar salad and I had the wedge salad with a honey lime vinaigrette which came pretty quickly. The honey lime vinaigrette was a bit too tart for my taste and I think I will stick with the blue cheese next time.

The yorkies were delicious as we had hoped as they had great flavour with the shaved prime rib, fried onion crisps, horseradish aioli and au jus working together.

Not too long after we finished the yorkies we received our entrées. The medium rare prime rib I had ordered was tender and so tasty. I couldn't finish it with the baked potato I got so I had it packed up. My friend wasn't too happy with his cut as it had more fat then he would have liked.

The dining experience here was fabulous and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a special dining treat. The only downside I would say about this place is the entire dining experience was a bit too fast for me. I believe from when we sat down to when we got the bill it was about 45 minutes total. I know that this isn't the case but I felt very rushed.

We ordered the appetizer Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos and chose the Asian style. The lettuce leaves were large enough to hold all the fillings successfully.

One spicy cashew and one sweet cilantro sauce came with it. These were good.

We came here last night for restaurant week. For $50 you get a 3-course meal.  I chose the crab cakes for my appetizer, the 6 oz. filet for my entree, and the molten lava chocolate cake for my dessert.  

The crab cakes were two per serving and they were pretty big. They didn't have too much breading and had a slight crisp on the outside with large chunks of crab on the inside. They came with a slaw that complimented the crab cakes perfectly.

The steak came with a gorgonzola cream sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about the steak with that cream sauce. The steak was perfectly cooked to how I ordered it and it tasted so amazing with the sauce. The seasoning was just right as well. Other than Joe's Stone Crab, this is one of the best filets I've ever had.  

The molten chocolate cake was good. It didn't blow me away but maybe that's because I was stuffed by then.  

The other time I was here we also ordered the mac and cheese and again, one of my FAVORITE mac n cheese's at fancy restaurant ever.  I crave this meal!

In addition, our service was excellent. Our server Danny was very attentive and super nice. My dirty martini was originally made incorrectly and he was so gracious about getting it fixed. Within minutes I had a new one and it was perfect. He even personally stuffed the olives with blue cheese for me.",2015-06-21 00:06:37

They came out in a timely manner and everything was very good.  We actually ordered more wings because they were such a hit.

All were very good. We were stuffed after and everyone commented they'd return.

Recent service examples: Twice got the indication staff wanted us to leave, bill came early, and there were plenty of open tables. One night we went thirty minutes without wait service, when we went to find our waitress, she was upset with us in passive aggressive way. Left food on the table or bar each night, instead of asking for a box to take it home. Waited 20 minutes to get a beer at the bar. (Yes, they are often very very busy.

One evening, they brought out bare tortillas drizzled in cheese sauce with a little chicken. Felt bad for the waitress, who was awesome that evening. Se we went to Culvers to eat after spending $72 at Bear and Bottle for one round of drinks and two apps. Unfortunately, the California theme also comes with West Coast prices for food.

I don't go to very many, but every so often I will get some tickets and I have to say that the Princess of Wales theatre is the best one to go to if you have not-so-great seats. If you are fairly far back, the seats are staggered nicely and you should still have a great view. I was in the 2nd last row for the Sound of Music, and it was still very enjoyable and I still felt to be part of the ""action"" (and yes, there is action in the Sound of Music). 

Now - if you have great, up close seats it is still good but I find the Royal Alexandra Theatre to be the better venue when you are sitting up close. I feel like the seating on the front of the ground floor is better there. I didn't have the greatest view when I was on the floor and off to the side at the Princess of Wales. But with that said, the seats are comfier here.  I guess it really depends which show you'd like to see.

Anyways, the productions at both theatres are awesome and I would go any time. Refreshments are expensive, be prepared. Eat before you go. Sitting through any musical, no matter how awesome, on an empty stomach (or an empty wallet after buying an ice cream and bottle of water) is not a pleasant experience. I must admit, I do find it hard to not get a beer and some chocolate covered almonds during the intermission, though. 

Oh - and show up ON TIME. The show starts 5 minutes after the time on your ticket, at the very latest. And even then, you'll be ticking off people when you have to squeeze by them to get to your seat. There isn't a lot of room to get past when people are sitting down (and they must be TTC riders because they refuse to stand up to let you by). Which brings me to my final point: pee before you see the show. You won't want to get up during it, and good luck facing the horrendous lineups at intermission.",2010-01-08 02:00:24

twPjvBgudT6K8_HcFUrmKg,QkNuVpkhV_wTApylrKOMDg,xvcGZGoLwWpmDMMY1VN-OA,5,2,2,1,"I was happy to be able to check out the new Thirsty Lion location at Scottsdale Fashion Square, and even happier that they were willing to treat me to lunch to do so. Full disclosure here that my meal was covered by the Thirsty Lion, but I assure you that the awesomeness of a ""free lunch"" did not influence my review. I have been to their Tempe Marketplace location, but I've mostly had beer and appetizers there -- try the Traditional Scotch Eggs if you're not counting calories and want something amazing: hard-cooked eggs wrapped in sausage, lightly breaded and fried. They cut them in half and serve with a robust mustard. Yeah, it's better than bacon.

I was greeted promptly when I arrived. My server's name was Lindsey and she stopped by to introduce herself and get my drink order shortly after I was seated and had a chance to look at the menu. Since this was a workday lunch, I stuck with the iced tea, but I did check out the ""adult beverage"" menu since they tout having 25 beers on tap.

The beer list tends toward the lighter side: lots of IPAs, ciders and pale ales. If you're into that, bonus. As for the stouts, I think I saw only two. I believe they offer a 16oz or a 20 oz pour of any on-tap beers. In addition to the beer list, there are some modern takes on classic mixed drinks (Moscow Mule, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, etc.) and another list of signature cocktails that looked interesting.

Based on the ""pub"" feel of the place, you'd think it was the typical things like burgers and fries, fish and chips, and other greasy ""pub-style"" fare. Yes, that is available, but their eclectic menu also has several salads as well as fun items like spicy Mac & Cheese, Chicken Enchiladas, and even Sushi and vegetarian options. I narrowed my options down to three: Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack, NW Pub Burger or Roasted Pork Cubano Sandwich. Lindsey was helpful and told me that she hadn't yet tried the cubano, but liked the two other options. I figured a burger is a good thing to try at a pub, and it had ""maple pepper bacon"" on it: SOLD!""

I opted for the side salad just to try something besides fries. I took the time to take some notes, check my email, and review the drink menu again. I swear it wasn't 10 minutes before my burger was sitting in front of me in all its freshly-grilled glory. I posted a picture... it's a little blurry since it smelled great and I was HUNGRY. This was no paltry fast food-style burger. I had a thick and juicy burger like the kind you'd make at home if you had the time to do it right. At first bite, I noticed the juciness and flavor of the grilled meat was complimented by a little heat from horseradish. This was supported by sweet and salty from the bacon, which had a nice crunchiness as a result of the maple -- it was a bit caramelized and cooked to perfection. The burger was served on what looked like a ciabatta roll, which was good because the burger needed something sturdy to hold it all together. The arugula was put under the beef patty so that it wilted nicely, and the white cheddar cheese was melted very nicely. The grilled sweet onion -- a monstrous slice of onion about 1/3"" thick and grilled -- was very tasty, but it slipped around a bit and required a bit of skill to keep inside the bun while eating. The one thing I didn't notice was the ""gorgonzola infused"" part of the burger. It may have been so subtle that the other flavors eclipsed it, but it might have been one of those things that as such an integral part of the experience that I would wonder what was wrong if it weren't there. 

Bottom line: Messy burger, but awesome.

The side salad had a light dressing... Just enough. The greens were fresh, but nothing special. 

I usually don't eat much dessert, and almost never at lunch, but Lindsey recommended their blackberry cobbler with orange shortbread crust. Wait. What? I asked if the blackberries were fresh and she thought they were. Okay, I've got to try that! The crust definitely tasted of orange, and there were large blackberries inside. If they weren't fresh, they were picked and frozen at just the right time. The filling was hot and tasted of warm spices... cardamom, maybe? The whole thing was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I posted a picture of that here as well. I made a note about the quality of the vanilla ice cream. You can tell a lot about a place from the quality of the ice cream they use in their desserts. This was high quality, dense ice cream with flecks of vanilla bean easily visible... it could be a dessert on its own.

  During the week you will have much more breathing room and less elbowing to do as you make your way through the alphabet-labeled aisles. Mind you, it took me and a group of friends 4 hours to get from Z to R, and A to H. All very good aisles, but I can't report on I to Q. There is just way too much to look through!

 The ideal way to peruse through this very large show is to have a game plan. Go on their website and download one of the show maps. It outlines all of the exhibitors and artisans and where they are on the floor. If you want fashion, stick to the fashion section. If you crave paintings, photography or mixed media, go with the visual arts section. If you are hungry, check out the bistro section; the samples alone will fill you up!

 This Christmas One of a Kind Sale had plenty of holiday ornaments and decor to purchase, which sets it apart from the show they have in the spring. Many artists have returned from last years show, but there are a number of new ones I found and enjoyed (or missed last year). My favourite was the Old Stamp Company which sold hundreds upon hundreds of ink stamps (not the ones you put on envelopes for mail).

 The stamps come in all different shapes and sizes and there is neat demo that shows you how to make truly unique gift cards, tags or bookmarks-a great gift for a kid or any artist! There were a lot of fun kid-friendly toys and games being sold as well, and you'll find hordes of holiday gift ideas.

Certainly that is a testament to their location and they must be doing something well. That said, I remember 10 years ago, their prices were better and their food was better. Over the years, I felt it has been a steady decline and it got to the point where I didn't eat there for almost two years, until today (2/29/2012). There are just so many ""pan-asian"", let me take some crap out of a bag, stir fry it, and charge you $10 for lunch places now in Charlotte, that Fujo doesn't distinguish itself.

I had the lo-mein, couldn't tell the difference from any other lo-mein. Someone in our party of 4 ordered the fried rice and it looked alot better than what I ordered. To be honest, if I wasn't so adverse to paying for fried ""leftover"" rice at ""Chinese"" restaurants, I would've gotten that, because it looked authentic.

FYI, fried rice is usually made from cooled / cold cooked rice. Some Chinese restaurants will use left over white rice to make fried rice, not sure what Fujo does, but I am always weary of ordering fried rice. Also, if the white rice that comes out doesn't look fresh and well cooked, what hope is there that your fried rice is remotely decent? Maybe I'm just snobby, but who goes to restaurants to pay for a meal of leftovers?

I visited here one evening with a companion.  We had never been here before so we joked as we approached the door about how we'd probably be stared at as we walked in, dressed as we were in t-shirts and casual pants.  When we opened the door, BAM - everyone was indeed staring!  That's because the entertainment -a woman playing a stringed instrument and singing-  was seated on a bench in the lobby right in front of the doors, commanding everyone's attention.  This was a rather disconcerting ""welcome"" that had us laughing later at our table. 

I feared that the place would be way too expensive, given the decor and the entertainment, which included a Thai dancer, but the meals were moderately priced, around $10 to $15.  The specials, however, were in the $20 range, and special bar drinks were $10.

I had the Tom Ka Khai for an appetizer, and it was delicious, with layers of interesting flavors. It wasn't as polished, nor as pretty, as the Lotus of Siam's version, but very, very good.  My companion raved over it, as well as over her chicken satay appetizer which was very, very tasty and succulent. MMMM!   She also enjoyed a martini, which was very prettily attired in a flower and a slice of citrus, and sprinkled with what appeared to be a little shaved ice.

My friend ordered the red curry with shrimp, and when it arrived she knew at once that the shrimp was overcooked by its appearance. It was indeed very white and a bit rubbery.  My masaman was quite tasty, though (my companion loved it as well), although a couple of the potato chunks were a tad undercooked. I enjoyed the meal quite a bit overall.  

Being who she is, she set her plate aside in the hope that she would be able to get a different dish instead, otherwise she would ask for it to be boxed to take home.  When the waitress  caught her eye my friend told her that she felt her dish wasn't flavorful and that the shrimp was overcooked, but that she loved everything else she had tasted.  The waitress immediately offered to substitute another meal, which my friend accepted.  The waitress then brought over the manager.  Manager asks how meal was.  Friend repeats story. Manager offers substitute. Friend accepts.

So... some time goes by and no waitress.  The manager wanders by and my friend asks her if the waitress will be coming back. The manager says the waitress is busy with another customer.  She looks towards the back of the restaurant and then has a second thought, and offers to take the order herself. My friend orders the chicken fried rice.

The order arrived but the waitress was now quite subdued.  I didn't make much of it (I hate conflict- I usually don't even send meals back) but I did notice that she never came back to check on us, didn't have a smile for us when she walked by, and was showing that she wasn't happy with us.  Since my friend was quite polite about the whole thing and there had been no obvious rancor I was a little surprised about the waitress' change of demeanor and lack of good service.  Luckily other staff were very friendly and handled duties. I was able to get a Coke from the bartender when he came to ask if my companion wanted another martini.

The strangest thing was when I got the check. The waitress just plopped the check on the table and, chin up, whipped away from us so quickly it startled me.  I usually don't notice subtle displeasure, but this was over-the-top rude, and made my friend angry enough to refuse to leave a tip.  (Me being a wimp I would have left her maybe 10%).

Sigh....
So, the food was very flavorful except for the shrimp dish and a couple of undercooked potatoes, but I really enjoyed the flavors. The live Thai entertainment created an interesting cultural atmosphere. I found the restaurant to be clean, nicely designed and comfortable. I thought everyone was pleasant except for our waitress during the last half of the meal. I'd give the place a 3.5 to a 4, but my companion does not condone unprofessionalism when one pays for a service, so she would give it a 2, so I'm rounding my score to a 3.

Both of us might be willing to try this place again, just based on the fact that the food that we did like was awesome, and the staff, other than our waitress, were friendly and professional.  Personally, I think most people would have a good experience here despite my own adventure.",2008-08-18 05:04:20

However, generally speaking, the food was good. The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because I don't think it was outstanding. There were many dishes that were way too salty for my liking and for the price I pay, I think every dish should be done perfectly.

However, I would love to come back here for a drink someday because the bartender looks like he really knows what he's doing. Unfortunately, I didn't order a drink that day because our table already ordered a bottle of wine to share.",2014-02-05 18:59:18

But after Island Foods, I don't think it's possible for me to forget about roti. Holy crap, this place is so so so good. We waited in a lineup for the food as my stomach began to eat itself because it smelled so delicious inside. And as much as I hate waiting, it was so definitely worth it.

The good thing about Island Foods' roti is that they offer chicken roti using only white meat. Not to mention the delicious sauce and potatoes and the delicious channa roti with chickpeas from heaven...Literally my mouth is watering while writing this review. 

It's awesome, and it's cheap. Island Foods' rotis range from $4.50 to $7.00, which is really reasonable since I've been told other places can go upwards of $12 for the same size roti.

I really can't stand this new trend of Neapolitan pizza... they are usually very doughy and unnecessarily heavy. I prefer a crust that is on the thinner side, not too soft and not too many toppings that you can't taste the deliciousness of the actual pizza dough. I usually stick to Napoletana (Montreal Little Italy) for thin crust and Taglio di Roma (Laval) for pizza al taglio. 
Anyways, I went to Arthur Nosh, next to Adamo, to pick up pancakes for my mother. I decided to give Adamo a try. I had the rapini and ricotta slice and the fior di latte and basil slice. Absolutely fantastic. I know I will be a regular... at least when I am in the area.

There's nothing special about Winco.  It's your typical grocery.  I'm not a savvy coupon clipper or price matcher so I cannot attest to the savings to be had at Winco.  A thrifty shopper I know claims the savings are to be had.

That said there are two negatives that shine brightly at Winco: credit cards not accepted and cheap bags.

Do not come here if your earnings are running low.  I just gathered my weekly groceries and expected to charge 'em.  Not a surprise I was looking forward to after waiting in the long lines.

On my first visit most of the bags were torn up the seam and the handles were split.  For one reason or another the cashier actually helped bag my haul.  How she could hand over bags so blatantly ripped is beyond me.

-rpyY-kxaz52ygEJoXjZrA,mIysRk_cJ5K_BMZ-r06TFw,kPorLswaS8h4xy-notLk9Q,3,1,0,4,"I saw the Titanic Exhibit here on a Saturday morning. It was a fantastic experience which I highly recommend for everyone. But as we walked through it, and especially as I saw all the wide-eyed kids captivated by what they were seeing, it saddened me that a huge number of Phoenician families simply can't afford the tickets. $20 for adults, $15 for kids as young as 3. Do they really need to charge 15 bucks for a 3 or 4 year old to see this with parents? Come on. The exhibit took us about 90 minutes to complete. I'm docking two stars just because of the price, which is shameful for a so-called nonprofit to be charging the public. 

Price aside, the exhibit is wonderful. It's in Phoenix until May 4, 2008. To avoid standing in line, I recommend buying tickets on-line as we did, though there is a fee for that. 

You start off by being handed a somewhat cheesy ""ticket"" of one actual passenger who traveled on the Titanic, with some basic information about him or her. The exhibit wants to put you in the actual shoes of that person as you walk through, which I thought was effective. Only at the end of the exhibit do you find out whether your passenger survived the sinking or not. 

I chuckled at the passenger I was assigned to, who was a prominent Frenchman traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the purpose of designing a bust of the then Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfred Laurier. Of course I felt a personal connection to Monsieur Chevre, as a former Canadian Prime Minister and Montrealer myself. My companion was assigned a 21-year old Englishwoman who had bought a 2nd class ticket, and was traveling with family to New York for her wedding to an American. 

The exhibit is designed to be a comprehensive lesson on the Titanic. It sheds light on how artifacts were discovered and retrieved from the ocean, the design and building of the ship, what the interior rooms looked like for 1st class and 3rd class passengers, lifestyle and daily routines on the deck, and finally the collision with an iceberg and sinking of the ship. Over 1500 dead, out of over 2000. 

Hundreds of artifacts are on display, from personal items, to fine cutlery, to a door taken from the ship. The one that struck me the most was an old uniform top that still had its owner's faded name, ""Broom"", on it. Mr Broom was a first class steward who perished with the ship. All of the artifacts bring to life a snapshot of the world as it was in April of 1912. Even if you're not interested in the Titanic itself (and I am not), anyone who enjoys history would enjoy this. 

There was a guy dressed up as a passenger there who, to my amazement, either had an incredibly impressive fake Irish accent (and I fancy myself as pretty good at detecting fake accents), or he was actually an Irishman. I decided not to ask him directly because answering me would require him to step out of character. He was somewhat knowledgeable about the ship, as I found out by asking him about the decision to have only 20 lifeboats instead of the 32 that could have saved every passenger on board. The cut was essentially made for the sake of having a nice view from the deck. Nice work, ship designers. 

I will say that the analytical lawyer side of me was slightly disappointed by not seeing much that focused on the factors that caused the ship to hit an iceberg and sink. There are exhibits telling the basic story, but I was left wanting just a bit more. Still, by the time we reached the end and excitedly looked up our Frenchman and Englishwoman on the manifest to see if they lived or died, we were delighted to have finally seen this exhibit. We cracked up as we saw one 8 year old girl ironically complain to her mommy that ""her"" passenger died even though he was ""really really rich"". 

Monsieur Chevre and the young Englishwoman, it turns out, both lived.",2007-12-09 01:08:09

I haven't seen anyone talking about their shrimp and grits but it's really good! Perfectly spicy. I'm saying that as someone from NOLA! 

The hot chocolate is also delicious! Strong recommend! 

The sweet potato pancake is a must! We have ordered it a la carte and it was worth the almost $5. I couldn't have 3 myself just because I can't handle that must sticky, thick sweet. The pancake itself has the perfect amount of sweet though. Sometimes we get it in the flight if we are really feeling ambitious. It goes well with the pineapple upside down!  

I will say their hash browns really aren't something to call home about. It's the only part of the meal I felt we could've done without.

I scored a pair of Stuart Weitzman tall, black leather boots for $65.00!!! You have no idea how hard it was for me to not wear these boots for over 2 months. August is no time for boots in Phoenix. Or September and barely now in October. 

I was also pleased with a sweet little mustard leather jacket for $59.00. It's THE softest leather..maybe something other than an old cow? 

My next trip was just so-so. I got a few pieces of jewelry for super cheap, but nothing that I'm getting compliments on. haha. I got a cute little cobalt blue dress for $12.99, but other than that, the shoes over picked over, the purses looked trashed, and the lines were extra long.

As tapas go, It's hard to go wrong with the options here...lots of traditional selections as well as a great number of modern offerings.

Hot lunch item + salad comes out to $7.75. The portions are generous, and the ingredients are high quality.

There are 4 or 5 hot table items that change daily.

My favourites:

- Sweet Potato Quinoa Pie (pieces of apples inside are delicious)
- Chick pea rotis
- Zucchini Lasagna
- Yam Burritos
- Greek Tart

I don't normally like salad dressing, but the strawberry dressing is amazing.

At first, we were seated at a quiet corner. The atmosphere was quiet and calm, although all the tables were taken. A short while later, we were asked to be reseated to the middle of the restaurant because an old couple wanted our seats. It actually didn't matter much to me since I was there mainly for the food, but from there on, we were treated like royalty. I especially appreciated the manager coming out to apologize and offer us extras for the night. 

Now onto the food.. We ordered a pear puree soup for the appetizer. It was very light and certainly something I've never tried before. However, you could still taste the pear. This refreshing appetizer was fantastic.

For the main course, we ordered the Linguine all'Anatra. A small size, but perfect for a small girl like myself. The duck was nice and soft and it sat on top of a flavorful linguine. Pleasant as it is, I think there are better Italian dishes.

Finally, we ordered the cheesecake special. I loved the texture of the cake. It was thinly layered, unlike regular cheesecake. The mixed berry sauce wasn't too sour either. 

If I were to make any criticisms, it would be to turn up the lights just a tad bit. Near the end of the dinner, I found myself full, but also barely awake!",2013-01-02 16:20:49

We got there at 7:41pm.  Instead of saying something like, ""Why don't you sit at the bar while we get your table ready""..or even ""We are running a little behind, we apologize!  Sit at the bar and we'll let you know as soon as it's ready,"" the hostess says to us, ""You're early so there's no table available.  If you want to sit at the bar, you can, or we'll let you know when one opens up.""  I was confused and irritated but didn't want to let it ruin our night so we sat at the bar and waited...and waited...and waited....30 minutes later they finally seat us.  To my suprise, there were at least 5 other empty tables, which by the way, never got sat the entire time.  

The first server who took our drink orders gave us prix fix menus.  I asked if we can order off the regular menu and he said no, they were only serving the prix fix menu, which I can't believe they didn't tell us when we made the reservation.  But again, I didn't want to be a brat so we just said okay since it was New Year's Eve and we were already there and had a concert to go to and didn't want to have to go hunting for somewhere to eat. It was way more food and money than I wanted to pay, and trust me, we don't mind paying money for good food, but I didn't want to spend $125 on a 5 course dinner when all I really wanted was a steak and maybe some mac & cheese.  So the watier took our drink order and never came back.  Somoene else came later to take our food order and we asked him about the drinks we had ordered 15 minutes ago.  He said he'll check and come back.  He leaves as well and never comes back.  15 minutes later our first course comes out.  I ordered crab bisque, which was okay.  My boyfriend ordered asparagus salad, which tasted like drowned plants.  At this point, I'm looking around and trying to wave down anyone who looked like they worked there to find out where our drinks were.  Finally, the a different waiter comes back and asks what we want.  I said, can you find our server for us, we are just wondering where our drinks are. He says in the rudest tone, ""Just tell me what you want, I'll get.""  So I told him I had already ordered a glass of champagne and my boyfriend had ordered a dirty martini.  He left and came back with them within minutes.

Our main course arrived then.  I had ordered the filet oscar with lobster mac & cheese, and he had the rossini. My steak was just okay nd his was more medium than medium rare.  When I moved aside the ""oscar"" stuff on top, I could see that it had been completely over-seared so that it literally was a quarter inch BLACK on top, and there was a slightly burnt taste.  I had to cut off that part and just eat the middle.  The lobster mac & cheese was completely overcooked so that the macaroni was soft and mushy.  It was inedible.  We were pretty much done at this point and didn't want dessert - hence NOT wanting to do the stupid prix fix menu.  I asked the waiter to box up our left overs (treats for the dogs) and to skip dessert.  His response, ""fine.""  He boxed it all up and gave me my check.  As I'm looking at it, a runner brings out dessert.  I had to tell her we had already informed our waiter we didn't want our dessert.  She rolled her eyes and just turned around and left without a word.  WTF!  So I look at the bill and see that he had autogratted 25% already. I waved him down and asked why and he said ""because it's new year's eve.""  At this point, I just wanted to get out of there.  We had an awesome evening planned and I was already so irritated by his attitude and the shitty food that I was starting to feel that if I didn't just leave it was going to ruin my night, so I signed the check and left.

Needless to say, I hope this place goes out of business, as I know it inevitably will.  Both the food AND the service sucked.  I've been there when it was Rare 120 and I had thought the food was okay then, but at least we had gotten good service, and yet that place closed down quickly.

It's actually quite hard to find a restaurant in Montreal that serves these Japanese-style ""comfort foods"" (like ramen, chicken katsu, tempura, chicken teriyaki) for decent prices and decent atmosphere, so this will be my new go-to place!

Ho Su sushi is fresh and delicious and the staff does their best to be as efficient and quick as possible. I've often sat down, ordered, eaten and paid my bill all in the span of a half hour. Now that's noteworthy... especially when you're in a rush to get back to your Queen St. Shopping Spree.

It certainly is a sight to see. The beautiful stained glass windows, high ceilings, seating from the original pews, and brewing equipment featured on the altar all made for a very unique brewery experience. The beer, however, was only OK. None of the beers on the sampling list wowed any of us. My husband did like the Tripel, which was purchased in a snifter-type glass.

We had a few appetizers to compliment our beer. The buffalo cauliflower was seriously delicious - I will be trying to replicate that on my own very soon. The untraditional pierogies made with rattlesnake and cactus and corn salsa were good but nothing special. The rattlesnake was ground and tasted like any ground meat.

The two downsides of the atmosphere were that the tall tables near the bar were very close together and the women's bathroom had a very bad smell, probably resulting from the carpet in the sink area.

Hmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)

Cousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...

We arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a ""Golden brown"" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a ""yes.""  I placed a late order of that, as well.  

While the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!

Also, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(

*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days...",2012-12-04 06:04:13

Same thing with the beer selections and the appetizers. We've been here a few times now, and the food has always been out of this world.

Where I am dinging them one star is the service. 

I get that serving is a crappy job, and that you have to deal with members of the public on a daily basis who do not understand the most basic forms of etiquette or social manners that would qualify them as members of the human species. 

But there are simple things you can do as a server to keep things on the up and up with the people eating, and presumably tipping you, at your job. Like when you serve a beer in a bottle, if it starts to overflow before you get it to the table, go get another one. Its not your money, so don't worry about it.

The second star I am taking down has to do with last Friday, August 10th. I understand that from time to time people want to throw larger parties there, but you need to explain to these social megalomaniacs that there are other people eating in the restaurant, and that this is not the local ""Pizza Shack,"" and that running around taking tons of flash photos, bumping into other tables, yelling and screaming, and acting like ass-hats in general is not acceptable behavior. 

It puts me off the idea of ever going back to Classic Italian due to their inability to deal with the crowd of what I presume are birthday revelers. So much so that in thinking about it I deducted another star. I get that they were a big party, but the rest of the tables in the joint added up to more money coming in than this one party would have. Always mind where your bread is buttered Classic Italian. I've been in when its dead, and due to your inability to hand out some crowd control, you can be pretty sure that I won't be there again.",2012-08-14 22:51:51

The ""Mexican"" sounded good but needed more Dulce de leche - I didn't really taste it enough.

The wait staff was really friendly and informative on the choices and on how to get the most out of the experience there. They have plenty of choices although I felt a bit confused on how they compartmentalized the different combinations.

After going ahead and diving into to the hot pot style dinner, I thought the food was good and the process was pretty fun. At the end we tried the condensed broth after it reduced down with all of the flavors of the vegetables and it tasted a bit flat. Gladly our waitress saw us desperately dousing our dirty water broth with soy sauce and offered a bit of udon soup base that we gladly accepeted. After lacing the boiling water with some of the base it was a compellingly improved product. Overall, I enjoyed it for what it is and recommend it to anyone looking to try shabu shabu for a date night or celebration dinner.

Until now!  I've actually eaten here quite often.  And, there's a reason for that - it's good.  Well two reasons - it's also pretty healthy food (in comparison to MANY other options).

So Boneheads (in the Stonecrest Shopping Center) has several positive attributes:   First, they serve fish - several varieties too.  Mahi, Tilapia, Salmon, Grouper, Tuna and of course, Shrimp!  We are fans when it comes to fish!  AND much of it is offered grilled!!  Even better!  Tonight, I had the Tilapia and it was excellent! Okay, they also have baked chicken - I've had it; it's good too!

Second, while it's not exactly ""fast food"", you DO get your food quickly.  So I think of it as ""swift food!""

Third, the sides... again, several healthier options!!  Grilled Asparagus, Grilled Zucchini, Sweet Potato Fries, and now they've added baked sweet potatoes!  These, of course, are offered among several other options.

But, I need to mention that we ALWAYS start with the Boneheads Shrimp appetizer.  This is one good dish!!  The Shrimp is fried (okay, a little won't hurt!) and coated with their sauce and served with slaw. (1/2 order of the shrimp is about 250 calories)

If you know what a calorie is, and understand how you shouldn't consume all that you can in a day, take a look at their nutrition information, where you will see that you can eat out, eat good food, and have a great (relaxed) time within a reasonable calorie count.

At this location, there is a courtyard right beside the restaurant with several table for outside dining.  On Friday night, they have entertainment - music that is always enjoyable, doesn't tend to have you covering your ears, and over which you can easily carry on your conversation.  In a word, pleasant!!

So, why not five stars?  I think that it must be price.  For swift food, it seems to be edging JUST a little bit toward the ""high"" side.

The food here is pretty great for the price and honestly a little surprising for a box restaurant with a not incredibly appealing exterior design (it's new and clean...just kind of ugly and unremarkable). 
I'm an eggs benedict kind of guy, so I enjoy their 'Eggs Benny' and 'Brekky Poutine'. The first is a well done simple eggs benedict on ham and English muffin: the egg is always poached well and the hollandaise sauce is excellent and creamy. And the poutine...the first time I saw it I knew I'd have to avoid this place or else I'd have a heart attack. Haha. It is fries topped with a poached egg, cheese, and bacon (not bacon bits or anything, but actual crispy bacon), all covered in hollandaise sauce. It is about as disgusting as it gets, but in the best possible sense of the word. Awesome. 
Everything else I've seen served has looked great and what I've stolen off other people's plates has tasted as good. I assume the non-breakfast food is cooked as well also, but I've never had the opportunity to try it or reason to NOT order the breakfast food.
Unfortunately, I haven't had a great experience with the service here. A little example: after a long breakfast meal my companion and I made repeated attempts to get one of the two waitresses over to our table to refill our coffee for the second time. It took way too long to attract anyone's attention (there were only three tables full at the time...1.5 tables each!) and when I finally did, after five minutes of waitresses in the back and at the other end of the restaurant, I pointed at our two cups and said: 'Can we get some coffee?'. She came over poured coffee in my cup, ignored the one directly beside it and walked away. This was so just brain-hurtingly-silly after such sub-par service the entire meal my guest did a spit-take with her potatoes and we couldn't help but laugh for a full minute at the inanity of it all.
You're a breakfast place! Keep the coffee coming! Heh. It shouldn't be that hard and I shouldn't feel like I'm imposing on you to get you to come to my table. This could just be fluke, and one of the three times I've been the service was adequate, but it is stopping me from giving this restaurant the higher rating the kitchen deserves. I will keep coming occasionally and hope the service improves.",2014-02-05 18:33:15

The portion of the ice cream waffle sandwich is ridiculously huge and the waffle has the perfect combination of crispness and softness.  It's so addictive.  

How is this place only open till 5pm?  Think about all the business they could get.  I didn't even mention their hot dogs which are also spectacular.  I had the Chicago Dog which had the right snap and bite to the dog.  The toppings were delicious.

The warm bread pudding was delicious. Their alcoholic twist on an Arnold Palmer was great. I applaud anyone who makes their own limoncello.

Sitting at the bar is fun on the kitchen side, because you get to see all the action and feel the warm glow of their oven. Servers are still very friendly, of course. I really got a kick out of seeing menus cut up and recycled as bar coasters.

Be warned though - their bar only had the ingredients to make the cocktails on their menu. Full bar isn't quite accurate. It's probably due to space, but I hope this changes. I look forward to a nice gin cocktail on the outside porch on a hot day.

Small update: went back for brunch again - had the biscuits and gravy and a seasonal soda. The soda was apple ginger and AMAZING. I say again AMAZING.

As a sports enthusiastic city, an establishment like this one was beyond needed, so I was happy to see if open across the street from PNC Park.

The space is large, right from the door, you have a few outdoor tables, a larger indoor island, a bunch of high top tables towards the long end of the Space. But wrapping around space is my favorite place to sit, the long Bar. Once seated, you can ogle at the vast lineup of seasonal taps from near and far. You are handed a bible of beers, almost literally. Pages upon pages, sorted and filtered by alphabet, different styles, different countries. Just amazing. 

Challenge: what if you like one style and want to try something new or similar? The staff is there to your rescue. Each one a passionate beer drinker themselves, they are quick to give you recommendations to help expand your taste patterns.

Now, a few things to be aware of: 

1. The place does not serve food. They chose to skimp on the kitchen to bring you a more sophisticated liquid diet. Bravo. Also, they completely allow you to bring your own food in, so grab up one of the menus laying around, walk across the street or call up your favorite delivery service

2. Be wary of the ABV. Tasty beer goes to your head quickly so heads up on what you are drinking. Also, when your bartenders make suggestions, it's pretty quick to happen that you go from a 4.2% to a 9.5%.. that happened to me, and i did not see much of the Baseball game I was going to see afterwards.

3. They have a stage for live music, this is just cool so come when there are people putting the pregame in swing

4. It's a beer bible, Just like a easter or christmas mass, some beer are only available seasonally and some are only ordered in small quantities. Usually, with my luck I attempt to order something that is not available. Makes me sad, but even the best place does not constantly hold 1000 different styles.

This location doesn't represent the brand well. The store at fairviee is much more representative of what is in America. 

Also, don't totally agree with a pricing comparison made in an earlier review. There might be some items that seem expensive, but the prices aren't way overboard-almost-100% more expensive on the price tag.

I had gel on my nails that they needed to remove and my guy has dirty nails because he's a mechanic. The two ladies that service us were nice but they seem to not get that certain things should be done for a manicure. My person that was serciving me put the acetone on my nails and wrap them for less than 2 minutes. Obviously you know this is not going to take gel polish off. So she starts filing them and the polish of course didn't all come off.  I had to continuously tell her tjat there was still polish on my nails and before you can put more polish on there it needs to be removed. I had to take the file and do it myself since she clearly didn't get it. After I got my nails clear of gel. She started an arm massage. This was strange  because normally people give a person a hand massage  and it can go up to the arm. But I just got  arm massage  with lotion. aAfter she beat my arm up ahe begin polishing my nails again. The clear polish that she used was extremely thick and clumpy. My nails did not come out good. She didn't put any type of oil on my cuticles she didn't cut any of my hangnails.  I'm very disappointed that I paid 20 bucks for someone that didn't know what they were doing.

- I had the fish special- large piece of white fish topped with some crab meat. They had run out of escarole, so offered it over sauteed spinach instead. Very good, loaded with buttery garlic sauce.

The overall atmosphere is casual, industrial chic, filled with your typical King West crowd. I was lucky enough to enjoy their American Thanksgiving special menu which was perfection! 

My most recent trip to HOTB was on a Friday night. They were pretty full so I sat up at the bar for about 15 minutes until there was a free table. The bartender who served me had the most amazing twirly moustache and made a fantastic drink. 

After moving to our table we ordered some cornbread, it had some spice/kick to it with a sprinkling of pancetta. Great starter to begin our meal. We then ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich, bologna sandwich, ribwich, and tater tots.

Tater Tots are a tried-and-true item. I've had them almost every time I go to HOTB. The inside of the tater tot is like mashed potatoes that melt in your mouth!

The Bologna sandwich is another crowd pleaser, I've never met anyone who has turned down this classically delicious sandwich. 

The Ribwich was a little sub-par/boring. It was alright, nothing amazing. 

All I have to say about the Philly Cheese Steak is that it was magic in my mouth. A++

From the time we ordered to the time our food arrived was just over an hour. Ok I understand it is busy and can take a while.... that is not what bugged me.

What bugged me is that after 5 min of placing our order we got nachos and salsa given to us. Then 5 min later they brought my younger brother (who ordered Fajitas) tortillas. We waited 45 minutes and by then we were starving. I talked to the waitress and asked her when the food would be there. I explained I am diabetic and need to eat at certain times and would I be able to have some more nachos and salsa to munch on until the food came. Well 25 min later food showed up, the tortillas (now sitting on the table for an hour) were stone cold. My brother asked for warm tortillas and the waitress actually refused saying that they were not meant to be warm and that the food was warm and not to worry. The salsa and chips showed up at the same time as the meal. They billed me $6 for them and I didn't eat them. Not impressed.....

The hotel, itself, is wonderfully decorated; the clashing variety of patterns, vibrant colors, and creative fixtures providing that ""boutique"" vibe without affecting the comfort of the stay. Speaking of comfort, we literally looked into buying one of the Kimpton beds after our stay. Our room was spotless, and the rest of the common areas were very clean.

Perhaps, more importantly, the staff was incredibly nice and helpful, and their dog-friendly service happens to be the type of cherry-on-top feature that will keep us coming back for any future visit to Pittsburgh.

If you're looking to stay in a central, city location, I'd definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco. The prices are fair and we really had nothing but positives to take away from the visit. Now, if only the restaurant connected to the hotel were so focused on quality service, it would be perfection!

My server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.

Next, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.

As full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.

I had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.

Paese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...

Because of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.",2012-02-29 23:07:17
XX3_iErCCf0SckMMHD_5vg,82lApbXK-SqT8TrfycMNPQ,uX2yJj5Nn0fP2YJiXsowEw,4,3,0,2,"I will preface this review with the following: I'd like to focus mostly on their yoga classes, as it would seem that their clothing and service has been adequately covered in previous reviews. 

But before I go on entirely, a few quick notes: 
- their clothing and accessories ARE fantastic.  I once scoffed at those who'd pay $100 for ""comfy pants"" but now own 3 different pairs of long pants and 2 pairs of capris.  Actually, when not in scrubs, I LIVE in the pants.  My favourite t-shirt comes from Lulu and I often have ""bra free"" days where my lulu tanks are the first go-to.  I rarely wear the gear to work out (with exception of the groove shorts, which I share between everyday and running wear); I work out pre-showering, and don't want to ruin my expensive gym stuff with stinkiness (that said, so much of their gear is now threaded with ""stink free"" fibers, I wonder if it would be worthwhile to check it out).  But I do often wear lulus for yoga, and have never had clothing issues with range of motion.  
- The staff at all stores, but this store especially, are lovely.  Always very helpful, quite happy to chat (even on a busy Saturday!!), and very upbeat.  The best time to go is during the week, though; they're much more able to help you out finding whatever you need, be it a yoga towel or mat to stop you from slipping away in down dog, a carry-all work bag, or great pair of socks.  

One other element that inspires love for lulu in me is their ""extras"": the yoga classes at this store are Tuesday evenings and Sunday mornings, and they also have a run club that runs on (I believe) Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings.  I've never been to the run club, and so can't comment on it, but I have been to both the Tuesday in-store and Sunday in-the-park (seriously!!!!!) yoga classes where you'll get a free (FREE!!!!) hour long class taught by rotating instructors from studios around the city.  Be warned, as has been my experience with in-store classes at all stores, the classes are PACKED, especially on Tuesday evenings (I've almost taken out an entire rack of tank tops before) but are somehow still calming and energizing.  This summer, the Queen store decided to try something new with their Sunday morning class by moving it from the store into Stanley Park.  Ah-MAZING.  I've thus far been to only 2 classes: one was with a lovely instructor who took us through laughing yoga and a more calming practice and one with Ginger (weee!) from Tula.  Both were so different but so wonderful at the same time.  If you'll allow me to wax poetic/hippie for just a moment, there's something very honest and earthy about doing yoga in the middle of nature.  The class also inspires some regulars; I recognized some folks I'd seen the week previous and there was a familiar and friendly acknowledgement, which (sadly) doesn't happen too often in Toronto.  Also, even though it's only ""supposed"" to be an hour, I don't think I've gone when it's actually ended on time.  I like that when there's no store opening to contend with, there's more flexibility and you can get a great (FREE!!!  Really FREE!!) class for as long as you need.  That said, 10am on a Sunday can be HARD.  I missed last week's class due to my Saturday evening ""events"".  

So, in summation:
- I love Lululemon.  I love Lululemon QUEEN St.  The merchandise is exceptionally made and the service is wonderful.  They actually aspire to be more than a clothing store by offering these ""extras""
- FREE yoga makes everything that much greater.  And free yoga outside?  Wow.  I may be in heaven. 
- My only points off?  Packed in store classes and the early-morning of the Sunday classes.  So show up early to make sure your spot isn't directly between the zippy hoodies and a rack of running tops and, when you're not in the mood for a big Saturday night, make the ""I have yoga in the morning"" excuse and make it an early night.  You won't regret it this summer.",2011-07-28 15:58:26

A little on the expensive side.  The portions were a bit small for the prices they are charging.  I guess they can get away with it, their food is pretty good after all.

But I was wrong..or maybe they changed their concept..

Everything was expensive considering portion and quality.

You can get same or better quality product  cheaper at Gallaria supermarket or H mart as well.

I think gallaria market's seafood part has more good variety and quality of fish for cheaper price.

Everything was way too pricey than I expected and pre made sushi was really poor decorated.

They also have menu for made to order as well but 8pcs sushi and 6 pcs roll was 25+tax which is not worth the cost and wait.

There is no where to eat also it doesnt come with miso soup or salad ..

Just going to high-end sushi restaurant seems to be better option for me.

They have a great menu, good portions of fresh fish (nothing worse than paper thin fish on a nigiri), and it's a comfortable place.  For me, the Dark Horse roll gets Hokaido that extra star - shrimp tempura, crab, and avocado roll topped with toasted coconut and some sort of yummy sauce.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating but it was very loud in the restaurant so it was hard to hear.  My colleagues all enjoyed their milkshakes. Some with alcohol and some without out. I had a black cherry soda that was really tasty.  We also had some fries and fried pickles.  I prefer pickle chips as the spears were a bit hard to eat.  You really had to cut each bite instead of just biting the pickle spear.   The fries were tasty too.  I want to try their burgers another time.,2014-06-11 17:04:52

The food was fantastic. I started with Chicken Tikka, which was tender and moist, pairing well with tamarind chutney. My spouse ordered the Pukka Chaat, and it was a refreshing dish, perfect for summer. For my entree, I had the Lamb Rogajosh, which was tender and sitting in a nice sauce. I tried some of my spouse's Vegetable Biryani, and it was absolutely delicious; I wish it was part of the regular menu! I had some of the Butter Chicken one of my friends ordered and it was very good, the sauce was rich, with plenty of chunks of chicken.

pqdEPyIa_L2KZ9vFvKMRlg,h-Zj9GUJvErqVOw-KPKNng,SJtbwP4_ed2B1AvIXd-EVQ,3,2,0,0,"Ordered the garden milk tea with tapioca. Also sampled a bit of their Jasmine Green Milk Tea. Honestly, overall experience I would say it's just 'OK'. The hype about this place was maybe because of the appearance, and the strong upfront taste. I had ordered a large drink, and my friend ordered the Trio. Both really good, but then we both realized that after halfway through the drink, the taste grew bland, and it tasted more like just ... milk. Though I still want to try other drinks, I wasn't an overall fan of both milk teas ordered. 

On the up side, the service was excellent. Explained the bubble teas I asked about very well. Friendly service. I sorta find it weird that they personally tasted the tapioca with a shot glass before making the drink (Quality control, yes), but from the other side of the counter, it looked like they weren't all that confident with the quality of their tapioca being served at the time. 

Verdict - I would go back and try something else that's not milk tea. Great service. If you're looking for flavourful bubble tea, I would just stick with the usual Chatime or Coco just around the corner.",2016-08-12 21:11:48
s3DktUmaIVGdGU9XDXX5qQ,JVbqMyicxGWlEVPpyo6gpQ,ejKXczjEkm1gzyRdblQm8w,2,0,0,0,"Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.

First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food). 

I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu. 

The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.

Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process.",2008-08-18 04:41:05

1. Amazing happy hour at the bar: 50% off the beer! Can't beat a $3 blue moon! Awesome price
2. The crab cakes were amazing. Huge chunks of crab meat in the perfect ratio of meat to filler. The outside was also perfectly crispy with the right amount of crunch
3. You MUST, and I repeat, you MUST order the Chocolate Mousse for dessert. It was best thing I ate all night. Layers of fluffy clouds of mousse and the bottom layer had a rich rum flavor? or was it espresso? I could not pin it down, but it kept drawing my spoon back for more and more bites until I was scraping the plate clean.
4. The onion dinner bread was different and delicious. The service we had was not that great and our dinner bread did not come to the table until after our appetizers were served and then cleared. But the bread was great- warm with cheese baked on top. I can always tell a good restaurant by their dinner bread and this was pretty good.

The Mediocre: 
Chopped salad: The salad already came with pepper on it and there was so much of it that it just overwhelmed my whole palate. The candied pecans seemed out of place. When I would actually bite into one, it just seemed strange and it did not go well with the rest of the flavor profile. The onion strings on top were stale. If they were crunchier, it would have been enough texture to replace the candied pecans. 

To pass:
1. Sally's New York Strip: sorry to say that you should pass on this steak even though this is a steak house. The steak was cooked perfectly- good grill marks and perfectly charred, but there was no flavor! It lacked seasoning and salt. Sorry to say that I wish I had steak sauce but I didn't want to be rude and ask for it. Also the meat was a little tough. Was not tender like I would expect from a higher end steakhouse. 
2. The cheesecake- not good. Too dense. You're better off going to the cheesecake factory if you're craving cheesecake.",2013-08-03 16:41:33

When we first went here, almost two years ago to the day, they were working out their opening kinks. But now, they are a much smoother operation. I am a fan of the whole locally sourced commitment, and they have very interesting taste combinations. They also dabble in the whole molecular gastronomy thing, which is always fun.

You know how sometimes hosts/hostesses can seem both solicitous and snobby at the same time? The host here seemed to walk that fine FINE line between seeming like he was used to dealing with high status clientele AND that he wasn't sure which class we should be categorized in. We were probably among the first diners that night, so maybe he hadn't gotten into the spirit of things yet, but I felt like I had been weighed, measured, and found wanting. That being said, he didn't do anything overtly to make me feel bad, but... anyway, just a heads up. 

But our actual server was incredibly gracious, and we enjoyed talking with him. We started with compressed watermelon with prosciutto, which was really divine. I haven't had watermelon in so long, and this was like a breath of fresh (spring/summer) air. Hubby had the burger, which was also quite good, and I went with the wild sea bass, which was excellent (and also about 3x more expensive than the burger... eh?!?! what is going on when wild caught fish is 3x more expensive than locally sourced grass fed beef?).  

Overall, we really enjoyed Habitat. The service was nice, and the atmosphere wasn't as pretentious as it was last time. But, it was really expensive for what it was. That is, there are so many more options in Pittsburgh that give the same level of quality of food for less that it's hard to rationalize coming here. But if you are on an expense account and want to impress a client, by all means, Habitat is an excellent choice.",2012-04-28 15:50:15

___________________________
A little over 5 years ago I had A1 come out and they replaced the springs for my garage door and put braces on the door itself.  I had to call them out again and was told the springs needed to be replaced as they were inadequate.  The 5 year warranty on the first set expired.  They have now installed heavier duty springs (as well as a new opener).

I came here in a large party on two occasions and the service was very good - we were always given free small dishes and sometimes appetizers on the house. 

I recommend getting sashimi boats and order some side specialty sushi rolls if you come in a large party. The fish is fresh and the rolls are quite tasty. If you order a large boat and split amongst friends, the cost goes down per person instead of ordering a single bento box entree. I always order spicy salmon roll here - I love the way they do it!

The pmall one is also always busy & I can't say the same for the Richmond one. The Richmond one is bigger and it's opened for longer hours than the pmall one however the quality of the food was not there. The first time I tried Kim po was at the Markham location and it was really delicious. Food came out piping hot and portions were fair.

The interior of the restaurant is modern and nice. We ordered poke bowl called cambodian and curry laksa which got good reviews from most people. Curry laksa was good but wish there could be more noddles in it. The Cambodian poke ball was great. Good amount of of spicy crab and avocado in it. Spicy crab was not that spicy and it seems like regular crab for me. But their special sauce was great! Yes it is spicy! I mixed a little of the sauce and it was good.

Comments on other comments:
- if you want a typical AZ restaurant that piles on the portions, go to any of a dozen chains in the area...Cork's portions are for normal sized people.
- if you don't appreciate fresh, local, small-batch ingredients that require a higher tab, then go to the Cheesecake Factory for a cheese plate.

I stay in this part of town often, so I've been to this location for breakfast a dozen times or more.  Here's the deal.

1)  Service inside is S-L-O-W.  It appears the Drive-Thru trumps the inside customers.  More than once, I've seen my Latte get grabbed and handed out the drive-thru window.

2)  Service inside is inconsistent.  Some of the baristas (one in particular) is friendly but DIZZY.  She gets my simple order wrong maybe half the time.  (How hard is a latte and some oatmeal, or a breakfast sandwich?)

These people have no clue what they are talking about. Aria is fantastic in every possible way. Trust me, I've stayed in many hotels in Vegas from the low-end (Golden Gate) to high-end (Encore) and Aria is perfect.

The beds are huge and comfortable, and I had no problem figuring out the console to control the lighting and curtains. I really appreciated being able to fix them at a whim. Frosted glass bathroom is a tad weird, but I never share bathrooms with guys (and I wasn't with guys both times I've stayed here) so that wasn't a big deal for me. 

Where Aria really shines is in its restaurants and bars: Deuce Lounge, Jean-George, Julian Serano & City Bar all had fantastic bartenders with loads of food and beverage experience. If you want to know what's up with this town, you ask a bartender -- they have seen it all. I also really loved the sandwiches at Jean Phillipe Patisserie and the 24 hour cafe ain't too bad (here's a hint: keep your order very, very simple). 

Yes, there is a resort fee, yes the smell of vanilla is overwhelming, and yes, it is not done in the same over the top gaudy 80s casino style that people want to cling to.

No refills on drinks were offered while we were there. The selection was similar to Sweet Tomatoes, but lower quality. The soups didn't look great, so neither of us tried one- and they were different from what the website said they would be. The breads were ok, with the stand-out being the clearly from a mix cheesy drop-biscuit. Kinda sad. The pasta sauces looked off-color and the pizza appeared underdone and topped with cheap (again- real???) cheese. The desserts were alright- Hubby liked his non-dairy iced product in a cone well enough and I actually rather liked my strawberry shortcake.

This cute bakery is easy for down town commuters to grab something to and from the office. My first thought for any pastry place is, how good and fresh could this taste at the end of the day. I was happily surprised and that's saying a lot!

The appearance looks just ok but the texture, lightness, flavour and filling makes up for the simple aesthetics. 

The plain croissant is my bar setter for any pastry place. This one passed and exceeded a good standard croissant, buttery, flaky, had a dense outer crust with chewy inside like in Paris, except with the Dutch influence. 

The Viking Slice: not exciting for Instagram and also kind of dry looking, BUT WAIT, it's pretty darn good! The chocolate glaze on top is simple like at a donut store(i.e. Boston cream donut glaze) but needed as this adds the extra sweetness to the marzipan filling inside amongst flaky buttery layers. It is not dry at all and very light despite its looks, I really enjoyed eating away at the edges as they were very tasty. 

The names of the pastry are all Danish inspired so I can't remember the names of the box I sampled. But most of the treats have the same similar flaky layers, filled similar with an almond paste and graced with a touch of icing or chocolate glaze. The box for take out is strange as the hole isn't covered with a plastic so always ask for a bag of you're carrying it far. 

This place is great, nothing too fancy just really good and true pastries.",2018-02-11 04:24:47

When the ceremony ran long, snow was falling, and traffic was miserable, I called ahead to the restaurant.

Upon our arrival, we were immediately seated. I had also brought along some personalized graduation cupcakes (which I'd gotten permission for in advance when making my reservations). The hostess offered to keep them in the back, in the frig if necessary, and deliver them to our table following our meal. The dessert delivery happened without me needing to remind anyone.

Tableside guacamole was terrific! I've had this several other places but Vida's is the best in my opinion. The generous serving size was plenty for our table of 8. 

Heard nothing but positive food reviews from everyone we dined with - some got lunch, while others got brunch. 

Service was good. Drink refills could have been a little faster. We had two servers (one in training, perhaps?) - they were both very friendly, and offered meal suggestions.

Though my cash supply dwindles and my waistline protests at the sugar, Steepery is deserving of the business. The drinks never cease to satisfy and the workers are top notch efficient and friendly.

I've made a point of exploring new drinks in each of my visits and I love the plethora of options. Drinking my way through the entire menu could take years thanks to the number of flavor combinations they offer. 

A few standouts are the chai, the thai, the taro, and adding the matcha flavor to green tea mmmm. 

You can't go wrong with any of the chai options. The iced chai is a refreshing milky tea that's robust with that lovable spiced chai flavor. If you're looking for a heartier dose of chai then go for the chai shake and fall in love with creamy, cinnamon goodness. And for those days where it's freezing outside, they've got you covered on the classic hot chai tea latte.

In terms of bubble tea, taro is always a win. Their taro milk tea and the taro shake are oh so tasty and the beautiful lilac color gets me every time. It's a feast for the eyes and for the belly.

Though their avocado shake is a tad watery compared to some other spots, I still appreciate that they offer it. 

Also in rotation of flavors I fancy are the iced matcha green tea latte, the royal tea latte, and the thai tea latte. Can't go wrong with these classics. 

Flavors aside, I love that they'll willing use less sugar in your drink upon request, which is perfect when you're hoping for something a tad less sweet.

Ending on an up note, Jen had Blackstone Merlot which went very well with our meal and the salads came with a very delicious croissant. So delightfully sweet and fresh. Amazing and such a nice surprise. Veggies were veggies. 

I reiterate the service was very good and the food was prepared to perfection other than the seasoning so I am chalking it up to bad luck. We will persevere and will be eager to return.",2014-11-30 00:01:45

But this place sucks. When it's busy, you have to compete with mountains of shopping bags and coats. People take chairs to put their things on which means not enough chairs. Space is tight. 

My fiancé and I felt like sushi and decided to try this place. We were brought to a corner table for two but one of the stools was used for a bag by another table. Than another man started cleaning out a table meant for 6 and gave us a speech about how normally this table is reserved for 4 people or more blah...listen buddy, either ask the other table to give up their stool or shush. We just wanted to eat (I was HANGRY!)

Food is cheap. Sashimi is cheap. Quality is Walmart-grade. Portions are huge though - this one table ordered some rice or ramen dish...the size of that bowl was like that of a toilet bowl for potty training. And I think for $8-9 bucks.

The man at the ""kitchen"" kept on coughing...nice sprinkle of germs with our food.

Wouldn't recommend this place. If you really want sushi, make the drive out. If you are really hungry, really, there are so many other better options.",2014-12-17 20:13:34

Okay, so maybe I'm just a little too excited about this place. But keep in mind that for the past 4 years, I lived in Irvine, CA where the only 24 hour things we had was a 7-Eleven, Denny's, one donut shop, and one CVS store. 

One day I was craving a smoothie and immediately thought, I'll go to a Jamba Juice! Then I learned that they did not have any locations near where I lived. But that's okay because I discovered Tropical Smoothie Café, which is better in my opinion!

This past week, I came here two days in a row because I liked it so much! When I first walked in, I was surprised to see a full menu of smoothies and food, for some reason I thought they just had drinks. Good to know that I can also grab food for breakfast or lunch here! So far I have tried the Acai Berry Boost and the Paradise Point Smoothies. Both were very good and made perfectly (not watery)! I also have my eye on other flavors that I want to try next. On my second visit I ordered the Paradise Combo, which is any smoothie + a wrap, sandwich or a salad (you pick one) + chips or fruit. It was $9.99, but for all that I think it was worth the price. I tried the Sesame Chicken Salad, which was pretty good. They even gave me extra dressing, even though I didn't ask for any. 

Customer service is great as well, friendly employees and no mistakes on my orders so far. Don't forget to join Club Tropical on their website. You get a free smoothie on your birthday! This is my new favorite smoothie place!",2011-01-09 03:36:21

ton kOtsu, NOT ton kAtsu    O =/= A

tonkOtsu means pork bone because they use pork bones to make that white/cream-colored broth.  Ton kAtsu is a pork katsu, or fried pork with panko.  Please get this straight and never confuse the two as they are completely different things.  

I've been here many times.  Although both tokotsu and miso are good (haven't tried shoyu), I personally prefer the tonkotsu for the straight, thin noodles.

It's cheap, authentic, and filling especially if you order kaedama, or extra noodle.  please don't expect them to give you extra soup/broth when you odrder kaedama.  it's just noodles by definition.  If you want more soup, then order another one.

My experiences with this location (and also some observations when randomly driving by), suggests that if you are willing to brave the cold in winter or heat in summer, get here before they open and your wait time can be slightly reduced.  A 2 hour wait is typical, though, so pack some snacks, a blanket and book - hey, if you're a prisoner, make the best of it!.

Having been here three times in a single week, I can undoubtedly say that I would rather gouge out my eye balls with q-tips than come here again any time soon.

You may be asking yourself why ANYONE would be stupid enough to come thrice.  Well, long story short, my driver's license got screwed up and I was trying to fix it.  My first two visits were mind numbing and the people who ""helped"" me were...how do I put it gently...devoid of intelligence.  I mean, c'mon, do these people get any training?  And could the employees look any less interested in helping me?  Ok, I admit I probably look like a freak and come off and abrasive, but at least give me the time of day!  Of course, waiting two hours each time didn't do much for my capacity for patience and understanding.

However, third time was the charm and I got someone who actually knew what she was doing and was willing to chat.  I give her 5 stars for ability, personality and intelligence.

The holiday special meal features Hokkaido milk tea, a bowl of Russian borshch, a choice of steak or salmon entree with a side of vegetables and spaghetti and a cake dessert all for $24.99.

So I decided to choose the steak entree. I had really low expectations and had an odd thought of having steak at a tea room. The hokkaido milk tea was thick and had a creamy texture. I never had something like that before and I thought it was nice. The russian borshch wasn't really hot and lacked something.  The real surprise was the entree dish with steak with a side of vegetables and spaghetti.  It actually looked like the picture for once. The steak was really tender since it was advertised that they used angus beef cuts. I thought the spaghetti looked dull but it was actually pretty tasty. The vegetables were just so-so as they were cold. I find that the dessert is not that special and it came straight out from the freezer as it was solid as a rock.

Didn't feel like cooking for Memorial Day, so we were browsing Yelp for a good bbq spot... 4.5 stars? We were intrigued & started to head there! We were a little confused as we approached it. ""Wait, is it in a house?"" But in the middle of a residential area along Thom, we found what looked like a ranch.

We were surprised that it wasn't a traditional restaurant, but an outdoor ""hole-in-the-wall"" family owned country type ambiance. We fell in line, which we were in for about half an hour (don't forget it was Memorial Day though!)... You approach an area with the menus where your order is written on a ticket, then give it to the people in the food area who prep it, and wait at the the end for them to call you with your order. 

Before we had even tasted the food, we were completely sold on the place. The hospitality and customer service was simply over the top and so friendly from start to finish! We were offered tri-tip samples, given free bottles of water... and they were even offering free cheeseburgers, hot dogs, and French fries for MDW -- which were delicious! Everyone at this place is not only hard working but extremely friendly! 

We ordered the THREE MEAT COMBO.
- BRISKET, RIBS, PULLED CHICKEN.
- MAC & CHEESE, GREEN BEANS. 
(also comes with a little cornbread!)
Also ordered PULLED PORK SANDWICH.

The portions are generous, the prices are decent & the food has great southern flavor! We enjoyed everything & left extremely satisfied. It's a fun non-traditional place to eat since its outdoors (it was quite hot out but the seating is shaded -- might be a little TOO hot in the later summer months!) & the place stayed packed with a long line (per the girl at the register, it isn't usually that crazy)!

When we got there, our reservation was obviously ignored because we had to wait in the INCREDIBLY crowded dining/bar area for a good 30 more minutes, even though we were on time. Reservations are so important to restaurants. If you actually BOOK guests, then you need to be prepared for them. A good portion of those 30 minutes was waiting for them to clear a table and prep it for us. 

Once we got seated, our waitress hustled over and was immediately charming and super friendly. She redeemed the wait time, but I personally hated the atmosphere. Frat boys and pitchers of margaritas spilling everywhere? No thank you. Luckily, we were in a bit of a hidden corner to ourselves. 

The salsa was pretty sick. And not as in ""Dude, those beats are sick!"", more like ""Get that away from me"" sick. I was not a fan and salsa is my favorite part of Mexican restaurants. The pitcher of mojitos we got was bitter soda. Ick. My goat cheese quesadilla was actually pretty tasty, though, and I was so hungry that I ate just about all of it. 

Even though my entree was good, I really don't see myself coming back here.

Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked.


The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.
 

The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!


The Food: 

- Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)! 

This aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.

The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.


- Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry. 

Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors. 


- CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!

- Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.


Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet.",2011-10-27 18:44:36

My husband, toddler son and I stopped in while visiting the Christmas Market on Sunday afternoon. And my main thought about the place....if you're going to be the only grilled cheese restaurant in downtown then be moderately kid friendly! We've been to several other restaurants throughout the city and even directly in Market Square and it was easier to have a little kid with you. In fact, we've been to Pizziaolo several times with our toddler and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. 

I immediately had to use the bathroom and took my son when we arrived. No changing table, despite plenty of space. And the bathroom was actually pretty messy. 

Then we get to our order. We had to specifically ask for a kids menu after sitting down, but clearly we had a child with us so why not give it to us to begin with? Then we order milk from the kids menu which we got after our own drinks in an adult sized styrofoam cup filled halfway. Anyone with a kid will know that it's very difficult to let a 2-year old drink out of that size cup. Certainly not a kids cup. Then we order him a plain grilled cheese, from the kids menu, and it was exactly the same size as my order. The bread was huge! Good for anyone wanting to avoid paying $9 for a plain grilled cheese...just get the kids meal for $5. But terrible for a little kid! Why even have a kids menu? The homemade chips were good and I enjoyed my own grilled cheese but the bad parts of the meal overshadow the actual taste of my food. 

I hate to make this all about my kid but we have been to plenty of trendy restaurants in the last 2 years with him and had no experiences like this. I would have expected this from somewhere like Le Mont but we took him there in May and it was fantastic. A grilled cheese place should cater to all ages. Won't be back.",2015-12-05 06:36:40

However, please note that this was my first ice-cream experience after years of not being about to eat it, so I am probably not the most discerning of judges.

Either way, goodness gracious! It was a cold night and for some reason, my friends and I decided that we all craved ice cream (probably in an effort to pretend it was still warm.) We drove over to Village Ice Cream and its awkward (slightly sketchy) parking lot on a Saturday night and were greeted with a line that was out of the door. Clearly, others had the same idea. 

There are typical flavors, such as chocolate and vanilla, but there are also more creative flavors like caramel brownie (season), pistsachio, etc. When we walked in a fresh batch of waffle cones had just been made, so that delicious smell was also wafting in the air. I got the caramel brownie and my husband got the vanilla. Some of the others got the coffee and the chocolate and everyone was happy with their choice.

The prices were a little high ($5/singe serving) and if you have read my other reviews then you know that I frequently will judge a place if the prices seem outlandish. However, the ice cream was just *THAT* good that I think it's worth it. The parking lot is also super tight (I recommend parking on the street) and the shop itself is a little out of place in the East Village.

The establishment occupies a pretty big space and they are able to accommodate a lot of people. Plenty of tables and chairs throughout. Majority of their kitchen is open as well. You're able to see most of it behind a glass wall. It's a great way for customers to know how their food is being handled and prepared.

Our server, Elaine, was really nice and informative. She told us what menu items are their most popular and recommended a few things, including one of their famous dessert items. But when it comes to dim sum, I don't even need to see the menu. ;] It's one of my fave Asian cuisines, so I have high expectations for it. lol From the shrimp noodle, shumai, salt & pepper calamari, to the veggie noodles and beef tripe, everything was so yummy! Pricing was not too bad either. :]

Unlike most dim sum places, they DON'T serve their dim sum from a steam cart all day. Our server told us that, once lunch is over, they prepare the food as you order. This is to make sure nothing gets left to sit out all day. When it comes to ensuring quality and freshness, you can tell the difference.

The rest of the staff was very attentive and always made sure our drinks were constantly being refilled. Since this restaurant has three owners, their menu has some Malaysian influence too.

Don't pass up on trying this place out! If you love dim sum as much as I do, you won't be disappointed. :]",2017-02-09 11:10:25

I'm a terrible person.

The first time I knew I had a problem involved overnight guests. Somehow they assumed I'd be churning out pancakes and percolating coffee early in the morning. HECK NO. I pushed my friends down the stairs (pfft! to their protests) and off we went. Once they had coffee in their hands and were ready to contemplate making a breakfast order, things were good. 

Sure, I could have turned on the Martha Stewart charm. But why bother? I have LGO in my neck of the woods. Anyhoo, here's a tip, which is going to kill me to share. There's no need to wait in that monster line in the middle of the store to place a food order. It's true. You can place a food order at *any* cash register. 

I just died a little. Everyone that knew that secret now hates me. (So yes! Head on over to the coffee area and place your food order.)

Whelp! An update as I've been prompted. Yes, there are two distinct sides to this operation. The ""Grocery"" (right side) where you queue up for breakfast and lunch. The ""Pizzeria"" (left side) where there is everything else. But I don't see a distinct separation. So my review below is of my top faves. Yes, you have to order the items below on the left side. But you can eat them any where you'd like! When you order breakfast/lunch you usually end up meandering over to the left anyhoo, so there ya' go!

FOOD
I'm already a notoriously long writer. So I'm just cherry picking two favorite food items. The roasted chicken and the smoked salmon salad.

Por quoi?
Well, I had never eaten a roasted chicken quite like the the one prepared at LGO. My supermarket special, which I thought the high heavens of, opening the bag and sighing as I absorbed the heavenly, delightful, smell? That was nothing. LGO's version is an experience. The chicken sighs as it falls off the bone, the skin greeting me with a light crispiness.  If I could recommend anything to pair with this, it would be the caprese salad.

Wait? Did I say salad? I found Phoenix's best salad *ever*. The smoked salmon salad was so delightful my dining companion can't wait to order it his next visit. A manly man. Imagine that. A salad that a guy is gung ho on ;) All kidding aside, this salad was filling, fresh and offered a diversity of textures. All while being healthy. Sometimes salads can be...too rich. There was no ""to go"" box. I ate every crumb to my leggings capacity. 

DESSERTS
I stop in here often for cupcakes and their miniature versions when I have a need to impress. Yes, I cheat that way. (Don't tell my Mom!) A box of their artistic works not only look delightful, they taste delicious. Their chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are ginormous. (And dangerous!)

DESIGN STYLE
The first time I visited I was awestruck by the novelty of the store in restaurant concept. (I'll update my review to show Instagram photos from here.) It's just the coolest place filled with the neatest things. If you need a gift to to buy, I'm sure you can find it here. They stock books, cards, t-shirts, mugs, candles, purses, you name it. I bet their buyer has thought of it. (They even have a special section for children's gifts.) 

WINE/BEER 
On the Grocery side (right side) of the store where the shopping is there is wine and beer you can buy. Had I not been with a regular I would have missed the obvious. Buy your beverage, meander to your table, drink it. (No fee!) Glassware is in the middle of the restaurant.

PARKING & MISC
So yes, this restaurant is popular. Parking can be tight. (But there's now additional parking on 40th & Meadowbrook.) They are bike friendly too! If you have called an order in, don't fret. They have short term parking. Noted clearly with signs and diagonals on the pavement.

Clearly, I {heart} this place :)",2014-03-14 06:28:18

And had no A/C or probably because some areas had no wall to seal the cool air in?  We had fun here but it was freakin hot!  Music was good.

We went to get drinks at the bar.  One of the guys at the front bar poured us patron shots.  He sucked at pouring.  How can you pour wrong?  He poured less than a shot, more like 1/2-3/4 a shot.  My friends paid for it, but if I did he's get a shitty tip!

We went back on dance floor for a little more.  The place was getting too packed and hot, so we decided to hop to another joint...

EjO2T387GyL3C-EDv8lyGg,d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg,pTZ4u-sEQr-yHq2Cl4EMEw,3,1,0,0,"A friend and I went to T Cook's last night for restaurant week. We had been wanting to try this place for a long time and were excited to go. This restaurant is valet only (which, if you know me, you know I have a problem with), so we dropped the car with the friendly valet and headed in. The grounds of this hotel/restaurant are beautiful and very well maintained. We were seated at this table with odd high back chairs that make you feel somewhat secluded from the rest of the restaurant. This would be nice except it seemed that it also secluded us from timely service. We were seated and given the regular menu and left for a long time. We had to ask for the restaurant week menu when the waiter (finally) came back. Not sure why they didn't bring out the menu originally... did they think if they didn't provide the restaurant week menu more people would order off the regular menu (when most of the people were probably there for RW). Anyway, our meal took a looooooong time, with many long pauses between ordering and courses. Otherwise, the waiter was pleasant enough. I started the meal with the corn bisque, which was very rich, creamy and tasty. It was easily the best part of the meal. My friend had the greens with the strawberries, and this was tasty as well. The mains were far less impressive. I had the saffron pappardelle and my friend had the chicken. The pappardelle was alright, but tasted sort of plain considering the ingredients. The lamb was not showcased, the mint it had on it was so minimal you couldn't taste it, and overall it tasted like something you could easily make at home. It also came out luke warm and the ricotta they put on it was ice cold. The chicken looked amazing, but also came out luke warm and had an odd flavor... sort of like a cleanser scent... it was odd. The chicken was sliced and lost any juiciness it may have had when cooked. Though neither dish was terrible, neither tasted like it came from a high end, expensive restaurant. I'm not sure why they chose to showcase these items on their RW menu, but I hope this isn't the best they have to offer, because it wasn't very impressive. The dessert presentation was beautiful... this place really excels in presentation.... but again, it didn't have that 'yummy' factor that is so important in a dessert. I had the chocolate torte, which was fun and had some great garnishes (the pretzel ice cream was surprisingly savory and tasty... the popcorn brittle stuff was awesome), but the torte itself wasn't that great. It was a milk chocolate and would have tasted much better if it were a dark chocolate... it didn't have that rich chocolatey flavor that you envision when you order a torte. My friend had the cheesecake, which was good, but again, nothing special. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here considering the mediocre nature of the food and the price. 


PS when I was leaving, the valet went to get my car and brought someone else's car out.... that's a pretty big mistake... what's the point of valet if they're going to give your car to other people.... eeek. They did apologize and were nice, but I would be pretty upset if someone drove off in my car.",2014-09-25 14:01:06

A pasta dish that was ordered was not available but we were not told that until just prior to the entrees being served so there was only time to take their substitute entree of another pasta rather then decide on another dish if we had been told about the pasta not being available soon after the order.

The down side is that they don't let you sample their premium flavours so it can be a bit of a hit or miss. I noticed, right off the bat, their pistachio is not fluorescent green and has a nice mellow and natural taste. The pomegranate was again natural tasting and it had captured a good balance between sweet and tard. These are the two flavours that won me over. As an Iranian, I know my pistachios and pomegranates and I am very partial towards those who show proper respect to these ingredients. As for the other flavours, the coconut was light, refreshing and definitely one of my favourites. Dark chocolate with chilies is an interesting one. The crema (custard) is wonderfully rich and creamy. 

You can't leave this place without trying a cannolo. The velvety filling and dark chocolate outer coating is a unique take on the cannoli. I was also very impressed by the quality of their espresso. So be sure to pick up an americano or espresso granita when you visit.",2013-06-24 15:09:14

You pick your crust, sauce and toppings: whatever you want for one low price of $8. They also have pre-determined selections if you're not feeling creative or you're overwhelmed by the number of toppings they have. 

Came here for a late lunch and there was only one person ahead of me. I opted for a make-your-own and got multi-grain crust, traditional red sauce, and some usual toppings that I won't go on to list. It appeared to me that you could get as many toppings as you'd like because no where does the menu mention any limitations. However, when you ask for a topping, they don't really put on that much. So I recommend that you get a lot of toppings to get your money's worth unless there is hidden fine print on limitations somewhere that I didn't see. After you order your toppings, they put it in one of those pizza conveyor belt ovens and in a few minutes, it's nice and toasted for you. It comes out in a long rectangle with 8 slices. But wait, there's more! You get the option of topping it with their ""Finishes"" which are herb and spice-infused oils, extra cheeses or sauces. These oils and sauces are also placed on a counter by the door so if you'd rather put it on yourself, you have that option too. 

Taste-wise, it was really good! The crust was thin and crunchy. The traditional red sauce was a little sweet, which I liked. My toppings were fresh, but like I mentioned earlier, not very generous. It did remind me of the taste of Vocelli's but with a much thinner crust. The pizza is probably best for one person and not shared since its more the size of a personal pizza.

When managing such an ""in"" place as The Cowfish, everything needs to run smoothly and have a great staff in place.  This was proved last night when the patio was full and the place was packed!  A minor glitch in the system happened when it started pouring rain.  Luckily most tables on the patio were almost finished and hussled out, but my friend and I literally just got our appetizer (the greatest nacho creation ever) and drinks (they carry Bells's!!!).  A few umbrellas were moved and we dined in the rain.  It was beautiful out and the patio was EMPTY.  Made for a great experience and the food couldn't have been better.  The management staff and a few different waiters came to check on us numerous times, braving the rain (which we both kept laughing at) and made it a memerable time.  I will definiatly be going back to the Cowfish, not only for some of the greatest sushi and such a GREAT menu, but for the ultimate customer service that is so hard to find.  KUDOS to the staff!!!",2012-04-28 13:31:09

Damn one of the 2nd worst BBQ experiences  I've ever encountered. It tasted like they really do serve road kill verse BBQ.

First off trying to find this place is a joke. It's in a neighborhood giving the indication your going to someone's backyard BBQ. Once you get there you enter this overcrowded room to order your food. People are climbing all over each other to order, and I was hit but the door at least 6 times because of overcrowding. Now while I'm waiting I watch some lady handling food with her dirty hands, BARF! 

So after witnessing health hazard 101, I finally get to order.. It's lunch time and I order a Dr Pepper with my meal. But guess what, these idiots don't have any chilled. Most business's have a cooler but JOHNS  BBQ blunder team just sticks the cans in ice, Except at lunch time.

The food is really a 5 star disappointment. The ribs were not moist or very meaty an overly spicy to boot. Someone went heavy on the pepper rub which just added to why the ribs just sucked.. If your a rib joint then act line one and serve quality ribs. However I remembered the boil & grill their ribs verse smoke them slow & low....

Michael and I usually order the Red Robin Tavern Double - protein style - which means it comes in a lettuce wrap instead of on a bun. He does so because he is a recently diagnosed Diabetic.  I do so because I am newly Gluten Free. 
     Today, I happened to overhear a customer place an order at the bar for a burger on the Gluten Free bun.  RED ROBIN HAS A GLUTEN FREE BUN???!!! I asked our server, Bree, about this and she said they've had it on their menu for a few months now.  She asked if I wanted her to bring one out to try but I didn't want her to go to any trouble and declined and said that I may try it next visit.  But she brought one out anyway.
     It was warm and the small piece I tried was soft and had a wonderful, 'real' bread texture! It was great!!! But, unfortunately, within a few minutes, I started coughing. When she came back to ask what I thought about it, I told her that, as good as it was, I had an allergic reaction. Poor thing had to deal with me coughing as we spoke and she felt terrible.  I told her not to feel bad - that I truly appreciated being able to try the GF bun. She kept apologizing and said she would go back to check the ingredients.  
     A few minutes later, the manager on duty, Rick - if I remember correctly - showed up at our table.  He said he heard about my allergic reaction and wanted to make sure I was okay and didn't need any medical attention. He told us that he checked the box the bun came in and did not see any wheat on it. We assured him that I was fine. 
     Bree stopped by again and said the only thing she could think of was that she didn't call out 'ALLERGY ALERT' when she ordered the bun and that the cook would not have changed gloves as he would have if she did announce that first.  Again, we told her not to stress about this. But that maybe we'll try it again, on the side, next visit and to remind our server to call out 'ALLERGY ALERT'.  Can I be that sensitive?

I came here with some friends the other night and left satisfied but without any strong urge to make it a regular spot.  We started with a few cocktails on happy hour special (6 bucks 5-7 M-F).  All were quite good and were made with care.  If this review were for those cocktails alone, during happy hour, the review would be a solid 4.5 stars.  

We waited about an hour total for a table for 4 to open up.  There wasn't really a system to put your name on a waiting list or anything as there wasn't a host/hostess, so people were pretty much just snagging tables as they become available.  Also, they don't take reservations.

We managed to order a few apps (fries, fried goat cheese balls, and the cheese plate).  All were good, though the cheese plate had only one solid cheese and two soft cheeses.  For entrees we decided to split a few dishes, so I ended up trying the pork belly ramen, the burger, a root vegetable salad, and the green curry chicken wings.  I wasn't a big fan of the ramen as the noodles were somewhat under-cooked and the portion was quite small for the price ($16), the burger and wings were great though.  We saw some other tables get the tacos, which we would have given them a try, but they were sold out by the time we ordered :(

Overall, a good experience, and probably the best option in Mount Washington if you're looking for a trendy place off Grandview.  However, I'd rank them slightly below places like Station, Tender, or Butcher and the Rye.",2016-01-17 15:44:33

We ordered a chicken parm sandwich on garlic bread with sweet peppers and fries, and a meatball sandwich with sweet peppers and fries. We also asked for ranch in the comments section. With delivery fee and tip, our order was $30.

The delivery was FAST.  Expected between 1620 and 1630, our food came at around 1610.

Inside the bag, there was one cup of peppers, and to our chagrin, no ranch.  I enjoyed the meatball sandwich, but the fries seemed like they were bland and freezer-burned, no doubt of the frozen variety. My husband thought that his chicken parm was ok. I think mostly sad over his lack of ranch. It was also on the same roll I had, and not any special garlic bread we paid an extra buck for. I don't know what we expected, but it was the same as mine.

I thought that I'd never find anyone that comes close to M&M's infamous blueberry donuts.  But guess what?  Donut Hut located off Desert Inn on the east side of town has blueberry donuts that are as good as it gets.  Even better...you don't have to travel all the way to Anaheim and wait 45 minutes in line to get one.  Here at the Donut Hut, their blueberry donuts are ready, fresh, and are for real.  Their blueberry donuts are crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, which is the perfect texture for a blueberry donut.  Don't expect a plain donut with candy coated blueberry flavor here.  You get the real thing with real blueberries.  Trust me, one of the best blueberry donuts that I've ever had. I also tried their French Cruller, which is only served on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday's.  Still pretty good, but I'm still thinking about them blueberry donuts.

Seang is one incredible man.  He treated us like royalty, served us some great donuts, and even took the time to chat with us.  Read his story.  Incredible...his donuts are too.

I ordered the Tonkatsu with Shiitake Mushrooms. They charge for any extras you have, which is pretty standard of most ramen places, I think. The broth was flavorful, but pretty salty, so I didn't drink the broth after eating the contents of my bowl.

The spicy pulled pork buns are delicious! I find it hard to justify paying that much for two buns, but it was pretty darn good.

I got a Thai Iced Tea. It wasn't too sweet and kind of watered down, to be honest. Hopefully it isn't always like that.

There were four of us and the restaurant wasn't quite busy. So we sat at a table by the street and the friendly waitress went over the menu. It was a nice break from French and I struggled to revive my Spanish.

We got four different dishes, I ordered the plate of the day (see picture) and it did remind me of eating at roadside comida corridas in Mexico city. A mix of three meats (pork, chicken, beef), sauteed vegetables, salad, beans, rice and assorted tortilla chips with mild, medium and spicy salsa. We washed it down with a glass of agua jamaica.

My NY strip steak was really good. The shrimp scampi was okay (which is the reason they didn't get five stars). The meatball soup was great!

I met some pals here prior to the big show for a quick dinner and was mostly pleased. 

Speaking of quick, Steph, our agile, amicable server knew I had little time to dally since I arrived later than my friends, so when I decided that I wanted the Cajun Catfish Submarine, she got it in front of me as fast as a truckstop chuckwagon would. 

Spicy, breaded, and garnished with lettuce, tomato, and an aromatic housemade olive relish, the supple fish was a tantalizing hybrid of Louisiana and Londontown flavors, making it an appropriate meal considering the following opening band's Southern-fried, Sabbathy strains...

The housemade potato chips were a little inconsistent in terms of crispness (some were soggy, others were dead-on), but that would be my only caveat, Rivertowne showing that they remain a more than decent dining option priot to or following an event on the North Shore.

I was drawing a serious blank when the sis shouted, ""ORIGIONAL HAMBURGER WORKS!"" ARR?? *lil puppy ears raise up in a questioning manner*

She quickly drove us there and it was adjacent to Phoenix College and had a cool Encanto vibe... I dug it. It's right next to this paint ur own ceramic pottery place that seemed so cool! When we entered the works...

It is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it's cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!

We had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there! 

Their burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there's no crazy toppings that don't make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?! WTF?? it comes with a boat and a car! sweet!! the perfect sides!! I bet burgers totally taste better on a boat!! Now if only I could get a $1,000,000 to find out if it's true!! But since I couldn't afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese. The sis chose a side order of half zucchini & onion rings and the cuz threw it DOWN that night yo!! TWO half pound patties with cheese! I'm not cool enough to hang with that! :(

We went around the corner, through the labrynth and paid we told the chick our name and got our cups, the soda fountain area is so cool! I love the Iced Tea section, there were many options to choose from! Sweetened black tea and green tea, raspberry and unsweetened tea... lovesit! and my sister's happy to see Red Creme soda can be found there too! 

When the food was ready I walked up to the wagon 'o toppings and had FUN! I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth! But somehow i managed and it was soo yummy!! Freshy cooked over a fire, it was so great! I haven't had such a good burger in a long time!

my ONLY complaint is that I wasn't sure about the daily meal deals... I didn't see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?! NOT COOL!!

But seriously, the people are cool and so are the other diners, there were tons of yummy firemen when I we went! Also, the attached bar looks like an awesome place to get drunk in!! It's totally on the list of places to try out! I really enjoyed myself here and got crazy full off of my huge burger and baby side! I still can't believe the cuz could handle a large double burger!! Craziness!! I'll definately be back with more in tow!

To my yelpers: i say go!! and try the burgers and marvel at the round lil circles of bacon atop of a perfectly charred burger! Load up on the toppings (like I did) and try not to bitch about the small sides (like I did) and try each of different types of tea (like I did) and maybe even a beer or two and don't ask a fireman if you can see their hose... (like I did) cuz they just MIGHT! but BOOO!!! They took me out to their truck instead of getting out of their trunks!!",2008-12-03 22:31:12

The halibut was kinda disappointing, very unflavoured, the matching sweet potato sauce was very overwhelmingly sweet. 
However, the duck confit risotto was very tasty, the rice really soaked up the flavour of the duck, and the mushrooms in there added so much additional flavour to it. It was an awesome dish. 
The grilled calamari we got for appetizer was just grilled well, very fresh, but the matching sauce was very bland and unflavourful.

Small Portions - Sounds like a bad thing but it's amazing when you think about all of the different offerings you want to try.  The nigiri is small, but the fish to sushi rice ratio is on point.  Rolls are typically six pieces instead of eight, and appetizers are small enough to not get you full too quickly.

Fast Service - While the service is not exactly perfect, the food gets prepared quickly and the appropriate amount of attention is given during a busy lunch or dinner period.

Food Quality - There's no doubt about the quality of the food here.  I've been here at least three separate times and I can honestly say, for Las Vegas, this is one of the best places outside of the strip.

The place itself is a lot larger than your typical nail salon, very clean, very modern. There was a line to the door of people so it made me a little nervous. But I figured that was a good thing. I waited maybe five minutes and was out of there in less than 30 mins for a fill and a design. I am very impressed with how my nails came out. They're the shape I wanted and they look great! 
My nail tech was Emma. She was very nice and We had a great conversation. It sounds bad, but I appreciate they all spoke English to eachother. It's hard not to assume they are talking about you when all they do is speak to eachother and laugh in another language. This place I didn't get that feeling at all.

1. The beer list is awful.  The craft brew movement is years old at this point.  Any restaurant in this price level should have one or two good craft beers.

2. The space has some nice architectural features but our table wasn't especially comfortable.  It's crowded without feeling lively, if that makes any sense.

3. Service was up and down.  They were personable and helpful, but it took them a long time to get around to asking us to order drinks, and then they vanished for extended periods a few times after that.",2014-02-05 18:55:11

I had the Eggs Benedict and it was just okay. Granted Eggs Benedict is an extremely difficult item to produce so I'm not sure this one dish should be taken as a blanket review. But it was pretty bland and it was loaded with some green leafy things (not found on your typical EB) that I scraped off.

In addition, and this is a nice bonus, Mountainside is right next door.  I will usually drop my car off and go have breakfast or lunch at Mountainside.  So, I usually don't wait, just get a bite to eat and it's time to leave.

The washes aren't cheap, but they are thorough and of good quality.  Also, the prices are largely in line with what I've seen from other places in the valley.

I've been here 2 or 3 times and on each occasion the service has been bad. I understand the place is in Noda and things seem to move at a slower pace, but it is unreasonably slow here. On my most recent trip, I had to take the checks/cards up to the bar to have them processed because the waitress/bartender never came around to pick them up. Once I gave them to her, she processed the first one after having to slide the card about 5 times. Then for my check, she told me she doesn't accept American Express, which I do understand, so I gave her a Visa. I then noticed a sign above the register that stated no Amx or Discover, but they are using Discover check holders...hmmm. So she tried running my card like 10 times but the computer would never work/accept it. She told me that the owner is in the back pulling reports and it's making the system slow and she couldn't get it to work. (why couldn't those reports be pulled during the day when the bar is not open?) Her alternative to the issue was for me to use their personal ATM. I told her that wasn't an option as I would be charged approximately $5 in fees for a tab that was only $10. She got pretty aggravated and handed me back my card and just said she would handle it. 

Also, the wine list is very small to be a ""wine bar"" and the pizza is not good at all. It totally tasted like it was frozen and heated up in the microwave.

This place became popular on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives. The show featured the Chili Verde Omelette, which I got, because YES, why not eat the thing that was featured on the show, eh?

It did not disappoint. The verde was mouth-watering and the pork was succulent. The good thing was the egg was cooked well too. I can see how something like this could become a mess - but it didn't - it worked! The dish comes with potatoes and a choice of toast. 

The only thing I can ding is the fact that I asked to have pancakes instead of toast, and the waitress told me, ""We don't make substitutions."" So, I said, ""Well that's OK"". I guess it was just a confusion, because I assumed I would be getting toast, and not the pancakes. But when the food arrived - I got a short stack to my surprise. Welp, she just charged me for the short stack, but then skimped me on the toast. Whaaa. Bring me the toast too, why dont'cha?! Especially if I am out-right paying for the short-stack. Oh well. Mis-communication.

You will probably wait in line if it is the weekend. My husband and I did not because we were willing to sit at the counter, but a couple in front of us wanted a table and they did not get seated until we were already halfway through our meal.

Quiche Lorraine:  Served with clementine slices, good, not particularly notable.  La Brioche has better quiche.

When we walked in at peak dining hour, we were surprised to find the restaurant so empty (not that we mind). En route to the restaurant we did find a lot of activity at other bellagio restaurants which makes me wonder why this place did not attract any crowds. The location is also not as attractive as the other bellagio restaurants facing the musical fountains.

The cocktail we ordered on our server's recommendation was the most disappointing $14 cocktail I've ever had. It just tasted like cucumber water.

We always wanted to try the hamachi crudo and decided to give it a shot. It comes with green apple, winter black truffle, tempura crunch. Everything combined it was very tasty with the tempura providing the crunchy texture.

Our server recommended ""three seas"" tasting of japanese fish, bamboo rice, ginger vinaigrette so went for it. There was scallop, hamachi and snapper. They all tasted the same since the ginger vinaigrette was too overpowering. Paying $45 for that dish was a complete waste of money.

We had the TRUFFLE-STUFFED CHICKEN with SAVOY CABBAGE, SUNCHOKE-PEAR PURÉE, FOI GRAS RICE. There were hardly any truffles to be found in the chicken. moreover, the chicken itself was bland and unseasoned. The savoy cabbage had some flavor and foi gras rice was probably the star of the dish.

I am no Genuine Indian food expert, but your average USA Indian restaurant will have the same menu as every other one, no matter what city or state you're in. 

That being said, if that's what you're in the mood for, then FOI will fit the bill. It's in a very sad-looking strip mall, and the management of the restaurant must be very anxious about all of the empty storefronts around them. But the interior of the restaurant is spacious and comfortable, and when I walked in to pick up our takeout order, I was immediatelly greeted by a very friendly host. 

The food was good, as far as overly-oily typical Indian fare goes. We ordered the Tandoori chicken, Tandoori fish, naan, and a cauliflower and potato dish. All were very tasty and served with basmati rice. 

I have two criticisms of the food:
1)the onions in the tandoori dishes were raw. Perhaps if we had eaten there, they would have been served in a cast-iron skillet, which would have improved matters. I'll withhold final judgment until we try it again. The meats were all very good, though.

2)OILY. Oh my goodness, there must have been equal parts oil and vegetables in the cauliflower dish. I wonder if Indian restaurants are under the impression that Americans really do want their food swimming in oil and that's why they make it that way, or if true Indian food, in India, is also as oily as what you'll find at restaurants here? I don't have the answer. 

**I will put in a plug here for Bombay Spice, at Tatum and Shea, which is Indian food made healthfully, without nearly as much oil or cream as most restaurants. I wish I could count on that everywhere. **

So, it was a solid 3-star experience, given that it met my expectations of very oily, very tasty average Indian food. It would definitely earn another star or two if someone in the kitchen made an effort to cook with health in mind. It's really not hard.",2011-01-08 22:25:05

First off, we were greeted by enthusiastic and energetic table staff who proceeded to tell us about the menu and why Holsteins is a step above the rest. We decided to follow the waitress' recommendation and go with the signature burger, the Gold Standard (Gold Standard Burger: dry aged beef burger, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli). The chef has won awards for this burger. And you can easily see why.

A couple of the pieces of furniture were chipped. Sugar Factory was yummy for dinner. The Buffet in our opinion was awful. Food tasteless - except the yummy crepes. Food was also cold, the ongoing movement of dirty food carts was disruptive and it just had a ""cheap"" feel to it.

The 12 oz rib eye steak was cooked accordingly, decent seasoning and was okay without steak sauce. if your steak needs steak sauce to taste good, it's not a good steak. A decent steak shouldn't need any steak sauce. At the same time, it wasn't a great cut or 40 day aged fancy marbled steak but it was reasonable for the price I paid. Decent amount of fat and wasn't that tender but not that tough at the same time. The french fries were pretty standard.

As truly exceptional as the food and drinks are (The bruschetta was phenomenal, and I would sell my soul to learn their Brussel Sprout appetizer recipe) the atmosphere is what is most distinctive about B&R.

Vintage wallpaper, playful taxidermy, books, plush vintage couches, top hats, distressed wood, and antique lighting, are expertly placed to cover every square inch of B&R with class and character.

Went here after seeing a Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder at the Benedum right around 10:15. I felt bad going to a restaurant so close to their closing time, but we didn't really feel like fast food and we love Butcher's offerings. 

Our server Sara(h,?) was great! She never made us feel like we were infringing on her getting ready to go home and was really engaging and able to take the time to talk to us about our favorite dishes and even about some different apple pie recipes which was so fun! 

We had the pig candy which is always delicious and luckily my husband only wanted a little bit so I got a great big portion! I ordered the chicken as I always do and my husband ordered one of the daily specials which was a duck and foie gras tortellini. I wish I could have tried this dish(but can't right now due to the little one), but the small looking portion was very rich and heavy and according to my husband absolutely delicious. The chicken was absolute perfection as always and I am convinced the best chicken dish in all of Pittsburgh. 

Sara was nice enough to let us know when there was about 10 minutes left before the kitchen was closing and tempted us with dessert. We ended up with the salted caramel apple pie and cream cheese ice cream which absolutely blew everything else that we ate out of the water! I can't explain to you how good this dish was other than to say that as someone who constantly is working to perfect her own apple pie recipe that I am not sure mine could ever come close to the perfection that was this pie.

It is a wonderful stop for a delicious meal, a great place to have drinks, a classy yet affordable place to take a date or a fun atmosphere where you can relax with a beer and watch a sports game on one of their large screen televisions.

First off, the food is really good at Milestones and it is definitely reasonable.

I have been there plenty of times where I have ordered an appetizer, a main course, a dessert and a drink and my bill came to $30!

For food, I have A TON of suggestions.

For starters, I usually grab at their famous hot spinach and artichoke dip, the garlic caesar salad or one of their seasonal house made soups.

For mains, they have a wonderful selection so you can eat light or heavy.

For a light dinner, I enjoy their grilled seafood salad, the vegetarian thai noodle salad or the Shanghai noodle stirfry.

For a heavier dinner when my stomach is about to eat itself, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their portobello mushroom chicken, complete with yummy cream sauce and accompanied with linguini.


And to top it off, MARTINIS MARTINIS MARTINIS!

As a lot of you can tell from my yelping, I LOVE martinis and Milestones makes a good old mean one!

They have their delicious signature martinis, which are all unique in their own right.

My favourites from the signature martini list is the Caramel Apple martini, the Bikini Martini, the Caramel Kiss martini (however this one is sometimes unavailable), and the Blackberrytini.

They also have their classic vodka and gin martinis for people who can hold the liquor and strong taste of the drink.

All martinis are usually around $10, which is not bad considering you can pay sometimes $20 at downtown bars.

As well, Milestones has great locations around the city. With two restaurants already well received downtown and uptown in North York, this newer location at Yorkdale offers up the same amazing stuff.

After a long day of shopping or looking to grab a bite before a movie, this Milestones at Yorkdale is a great new addition.",2009-05-19 19:37:04

Anyway the food. I had a bacon cheese burger. My boyfriend got the barn burner (I think) and we both were able to compare it to Burger King. I love BK, but the fact that you can compare the two should say enough. I honestly didn't like it at all. It was really dry, the patties are so thin. I'd prefer one thick one.

Shania still commands the stage like no other.  And Caesar's security/ushers will escort you out if you record her concert like no other as well, so don't do it.  

She's seriously hot though, and she looked so happy on stage.  She let her hair fluff out loose, did the dosey doe and sang the music we all loved.  My friend said she thought her voice was a little weak compared to her past concerts and current country singers today but I couldn't tell, she's hot and the a capella to the 3rd and 2nd to last sets where it's just her vocals I still couldn't tell.  Damn, she's hot.

When I booked our tickets it looked like she had less than 10 dates for this month so jump on it as soon as you can!  She won't be back until March(?).  I wonder if she'll be my +1 to a Yelp event.  

Mrs. Kevin, I mean Mrs. Twain did not disappoint, her band was solid and you can tell they put this concert together with some thought into it rather than last minute.  No luck was needed to pull off a successful 2nd night concert (Knocks under table for Shania! Mutliple times!).  I thought the beginning of the show started off slow but then from the middle through the end it went by so fast, I don't know if it was because I could start recognizing the songs or the songs became more ""fun"" mixed in with crowd interaction.   Regardless she was hot from beginning to end.  But the epic sequences to follow towards the end and leading to the conclusion of the show was just perfect.

Now with the other grocery stores doing what they have to gain marketshare, this location and maybe the entire store seem a bit dated IMO.  I went in to buy flowers since they have always had a great selection and good pricing.  Since it's been a while I waled through.

I have grown to like the wide aisles and big selection of the other stores.  Fresh Market just seems crowded and walking around there isn't a real flow.  The meat counter was understaffed although there was a nice selection.  Walking up and down the aisles there was some pretty good stuff and I found what I wanted.  Cashiers were friendly and the experience was good.  The ""buggys"" were the older metal kind and were dated and rusty.  Definitely time for an upgrade.

What stops me from giving this specific location a better rating is the employees. Not to say that each of them is awful because some of them actually do give good customer service.

However, there are several things about associates at this location that have me RUNNING to the Target that is only a hop, skip, and a jump away.

1. There was an associate with a large tattoo across his fingers. It spelled out the derogatory term that means female dog. He waited on me in Customer Service.

2. Associates with sagging pants. One guy's pants were so low, they were UNDER his buttocks. Which -- because his shirt was rather long -- would not have been visible if he didn't have to bend and reach. 

But he did have to bend and reach. And that's when I saw that his plaid boxer shorts were stuck in the crack of his butt.

3. The associates who ARE rude, disinterested in customer care, etc. Every time I go to this location, I encounter at least a few. These are the associates who never say ""Excuse me"" when they are about to bump into you, either with their bodies or those mechanized pallets full of boxes. They are the associates who attempt to walk  past you as you are walking up to them with a question as well as the ones who pretend not to hear you when you walk up to them and say ""Excuse me..."".

I have read horrible statistics on WalMart's working conditions, etc. and understand that some of the associates may not be able to give their best job performance at all times.

However there are stores where employees ARE able to do so because they know if they don't, they will be reprimanded and perhaps dismissed for lack of adherence to company policy.

While I don't think employees need to be frightened into giving their best, I do think one should take pride in the work one does. 

Especially if one wants to continues to make money doing so.

We normally get the Butter Chicken and the Saag Paneer and mix it up with the other two-- maybe take some home or eat it all-- just depends.

On this occasion, we noticed they had a buffet. I'm not a huge fan of the Indian buffet unless the place does major traffic and even then, it's dicey. Not that I worry about germs, but I find the food to be of supreme low quality-- almost everywhere. We opted for the menu, with the addition of the Lamb Rogan Johst and what I would normally call Bhartha (Eggplant curry) But it was served as whole baby eggplants in a rich spicy tomato gravy. OOhhh... this one was soooo good! The others were delicious,too and almost always are. 

In addition to the fine noshes, I also love that they have a cheap Chilean Sav Blanc that is totally quaffable with spicy stuff for $7 a glass $24 a bottle. Prices for the mains are reasonable here, too. The most expensive curry was our Butter Chicken at $12. Good Times.

Service was fabulous. Two different servers looked after us and we always had lots of water and more importantly-- another glass of wine! Nothing that wasn't full was ever left on the table.

While the food and service here are both of exceptional quality, I find the ambiance to be lacking. No real decor to speak of and the menus were dirty. The bathrooms were also not super clean.

The boy and I visited Portland's Friday evening after not having been in nearly a year. We used to frequent the bar for the great beer list and the amazing BBQ Chicken pizza and fries, so we were a bit disappointed to see that things have changed.

Gone was the list of quirky, hard to find microbrews. Instead, Heineken, Pacifico, and Stella Artois graced the list. There were a few good ones- notably the sweet and strong (8%) Sri Lankan Lion Stout- but all in all, much more pedestrian than it used to be.

Another disappointment set in when we realized the BBQ Chicken pizza was no longer on the menu. No worries though- the Pepe Rosso  pizza was delicious. With herbed ricotta, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and basil, it was much better than I thought it was going to be. Score!

Even with the good beer and great pizza, the highlight of the evening had to be the parmesan fries. These alone make the trip down here worth it. I don't know what they do to them, other than parmesan and parsley, but they are divine.",2008-08-18 15:30:31

The Sunday buffet has shrimp, bagels and lox, hash, eggs benedict, a omlette station and a carving station. 12 bucks certainly beats 40 bucks on the strip for essentially the same breakfast.",2015-04-28 18:34:34

I was getting together with a few friends last night and they picked Leroy Fox South End, being new to the area, I was excited to give this place a try. I've heard the decor is trendy and cozy but the food isn't anything to write home about. With that being said, I tried to go in with an open mind, but now I understand why I was given such stark reviews from the get-go.

Walking in, I wasn't instantly greeted and waited at the host stand for 5 minutes before I was acknowledged. Finally, I was whisked away to a booth.  Again, it took several minutes of awkward sitting and waiting until our server greeted us and brought us water. Without an introduction, or note of specials he left and didn't come back for what felt like 20 minutes. We didn't order until 8:15 and I arrived at 7:30. This seemed very strange. Other tables seemed to be getting rather good service, so I don't know why we weren't. 

The grub:
+Meh. This is a disaster area for a vegetarian. Sure, there are fish options, but no tofu, sweet potatoes or just general no meats. 
+One saving grace- sweet potato tots. These things were like little balls of heaven. They melt in your mouth and there is a subtle hint of cinnamon! YUM!
+White Wine- served at room temperature. NOPE.

The final straw that broke the camel's back was the check game. I had to request the check and 10 minutes later our server came back with checks for us. Awesome. I paid cash. My total was $12.99 and I left $15. Typically if I leave enough with tip, I say something along the lines of,  ""I don't need change"" or ""the rest if for you."" Well, I had a few singles and I was assuming (if it was a good server) I'd get change. Nope. He never came back with my change, so that was his tip. Honestly, I wasn't planning on leaving more because the service was so horrendous anyway. 

TL;DR: abysmal service, too loud for a conversation and not very veggie friendly. Will I be back? NOPE.",2017-12-29 15:31:54

There was a big playoff game so I figured it was a good a time as any. If you like sports, this is a great place to watch the game! While this restaurant has a sports bar atmosphere, it is NOT SMOKY AT ALL and NO SMOKING IS ALLOWED inside. We saw lots of families dining here so it's an a-ok place to bring the kids if you have 'em.

I did love the atmosphere here. The servers all wear team jerseys, or at least they were on the day of my visit. I do not like football but when you are watching a live game surrounded by hoards of cheering fans, it's hard NOT to get into the spirit of things. My husband on the other hand was super happy to be able to keep his eyes glued to the game -- this place has tons of televisions everywhere you look so everybody has a great view. There's even live coverage on the speakers in the restrooms. So if you have someone in your party who loves sports, take them here because if you don't like sports, you can still eat and drink and have a fun time.

Unfortunately, the sports bar atmosphere was the only thing this place had going for it. That and the chicken zingers. The chicken zingers are really fresh, tasty and worth their $10 price tag. They are very thin breast meat chicken strips, breaded and fried before being tossed with your choice of inventive sauces. I'll give Miller's Ale House that, these things are good. 

The service and food was abysmal. Our awkward server was just, well, BIZARRE. We told him it was our first time here and he started almost arguing with me, saying that he knew he had seen me in here before. Um, okay dude, I swear it was my first time here. He also hovered around our booth to the point where we started to have uncomfortable silences. We had some questions about the menu so he answered them and gave way too much information, down to the point where he said ""we don't get too many complaints on that one, but stay away from the fish, I got sick from the mushrooms, etc."" WTF?

After his tremendous vote of confidence, I decided to go with something safe for a sports bar style restaurant -- a bacon cheeseburger. Hubby did the same. Wow, were we way off! The burgers were terrible! I took a bite and said ""this is like a bad version of Carl's Jr.'s six dollar burger."" More like meatloaf, this overdone piece of ground beef was just plain bad. Both of our burgers were overcooked, flavorless and were obviously comprised of very poor quality ingredients. I opted for veggies as my side instead of fries and they brought me ho-hum frozen green beans. They were an obvious afterthought and were flavorless. Hubby had the side salad and I snuck a bite -- we both agreed this was good. If I ever have to dine here again, I think I'd order the salad topped with the chicken zingers.

We had to wait forever for refills and our check. The place got packed but even when it was empty our server was bad. The restaurant itself is huge with ample seating both indoors and outside. They have a nice outdoor patio with fire pits. The bar area is huge but some of the tables are long and tall so you'll have to sit on a stool and share with strangers. The dining area has nice, big wooden booths but there's no padding which means a massive amount of ""butt hurt"" if you sit more than an hour. 

I'm not really a fan of this place. I might decide to give it another try in the future, but I'm not in any hurry to return.",2014-01-17 04:36:08

  Threatened, for years by increasing rent prices in one of Toronto's trendiest neighbourhoods, the Royal has been shut down a few times during some tough times. Today, the Royal is still an indie owned and operated theatre that usually has about 3 or 4 popular films playing and is house for events such as the Toronto Film Festival every year.

  This is the kind of theatre that makes you feel like you're watching a movie in the 1930s. The seats are close knit, and the room is small. The movie projector makes that rattling noise and you truly feel a sense of community and kinship with the other movie goers. It's almost as if you've all been let in on a little secret and are smug that the people outside don't know about it. I love seeing films at the Royal!

 Best of all, the prices are reasonable-about $10 will get you a movie AND a snack during a matinee! I also think the Royal is a great place to bring a date if you're out for a movie.

It was topped with kalamata olives, lettuce, tomatoes, and a type of sun dried aoli. My two dining pals ordered the Chicken Roti, with pear, pesto, Swiss cheese and aoli (um, YUMMM?? I could eat this sandwich every day of my life) and Grilled Cheese with Almond soup. OH, and I cannot forget the POTATOES. They are phenomenal- crisp and savory on the outside and soooo tender on the outside. all the way down to the cumin ketchup. Unfortunately I did not have a chance to try the Almond Soup, as my friend was lapping it up at warp speed. A clear sign of deliciousness.

As much as I loved my veggie burger, I had a slight bit of buyers envy over the Chicken Roti. The flavors are SO clean and unique.

I'm not sure whose brilliance is behind the launch of the Porch, but they deserve many kudos. It is the perfect addition to the campus, and inexpensive!

The salesman was friendly and helpful (as he should be when I spend that kind of dough on a car).  I was smart enough to get my trade in appraised by Car Max FIRST, before going to the Audi dealership.  Since they know that Car Max will honor that value for 7 days, Audi had to honor it as well, if they wanted to sell me a car.  They ended up giving me a little extra.  Let me say that, thank goodness the remainder of the warranty was included in the price, because I ended up having some major issues with the car (a 2008 A4 Turbo) about 3 months after I bought it.

I took the car into the service department, and they were unable to find anything wrong with it.  They suggested I just get the oil changed, which I did.  After a weekend road trip to San Diego, the car was barely running, so I had to take it back in.  Nancy and Brett were both really helpful, and I understand that the situation was not their fault.  They did all they could do.  However, the mechanics could not figure out what was causing the issue.  They started out by replacing some fuel pumps.  That didn't solve the problem.  Then they replaced the transmission.  Still no luck.  Finally, they brought in a specialist from Germany and ended up replacing the entire engine.  That fixed it, but they had my car for over a month.  Luckily, I was cruising around in a sweet loaner 2012 Q5 while they had my car.  It is just a bit disappointing that I had such major issues with a car I purchased just a few months prior.  They still never figured out what the problem was, but it is all fixed.  Recently, I have replaced my battery and scheduled some maintenance (for 35k miles), and Brice, who is the service manager, has been awesome.  The service department is very busy (can't help but think it's because they might sell lemons like they did to me, but whatever), so if you will require a loaner car, you need to make advance arrangements.

It may sound strange, but I work for a luxury hotel, and verbiage is very important to us.  That being said, I really think that the receptionists need to work on their verbiage.  Sometimes when I call, I feel like they are bothered by having to assist me. They aren't always so friendly, which is unfortunate for the cost of the product they are selling.

Service on Audis is VERY expensive in general.  If you are considering buying one of these vehicles, I would suggest the Audi Care package - otherwise you will be paying an arm and a leg anytime your car requires an oil change or scheduled maintenance.  I wish that I would have bought this option, but it was not offered to me when I purchased my car.

Overall, I think that you get personalized service (which is expected), and they do not just treat you like a ""number.""  I can't imagine buying anything other than an Audi in the future, even though I may not have had the best experience this time around.",2012-08-14 23:52:40

I gave them 4 stars because the first time I came here I remember ordering the calamari which was about 10 dollars. It was good but for that price you get a small portion and honestly one person could scarf it down and not even think twice about it. My recommendation would be to get the hotwings instead because you will actually get more meat for the price. 5 pieces were about 6 bucks and 10 was about 3 bucks more. The two flavors they have are lemon pepper and cajun. No, you cant get both flavors if you order 10 pieces. You would have to order separate to get both flavors. Why you cant split it I dont know. The server couldnt answer my question.

The most common question I get is, ""Is it better than Hot n' Juicy?"" My answer would be ""YES!"" Both are similar but Boiling Crab has more advantages namely my 1 thru 5's above. Go eat at both and you can come up with your own conclusion, but as you can see I already gave you mine.

We hoped up to the bar. It wasn't that busy so we sat and ordered a couple drinks - however the bartender seemed either flustered or tired and forgot my bloody at first. No biggie cause it was good. Comes with some bacon too!

The menu is pretty straight forward and simple however the options are so good its hard to decide. We were originally going to get the zucchini fries to share, but decided since sides don't come with the burger, we would get them as a side and get onion rings as well. 

I had the Samburger - which was delicious. The meat could have used a slight more seasoning, but I have a feeling they backed off because of the bacon which is OK because it was pretty salty and took care of that element - but if I didn't have the bacon, it would have needed more (there were plenty of bites with out bacon). Hubs had the turkey sloppy Joe which was just an awesome version of comfort food. They serve theirs with cheese and a pablano to fancy it up - but they totally could have just given you a bowl of it and it would have been amazing.

All around - ok service with great food. Both of us commented that it must have been an off day for the server because he also forgot the extra pickles I asked for - and the service wasn't typical of the Fox Restaurants.

I got the french onion soup, the mussels, and the creme brulee. The french onion soup is fantastic. The soup itself is rich with sauteed onion and bread that has soaked in all the flavor of the broth. And the best part of course, is the gruyere cheese on top, especially the crusty parts. I'm really not doing it enough justice by describing it. 

The mussels are good (but not as good as the soup, ha). I love that they present it in the cast iron pot. Comme Ca's mussels come with whole roasted garlic and sausage. I love the garlic (it's been cooked long enough to be super sweet) but not the sausage so much. It gives it a meaty and heavy taste, and I'd prefer it to be lighter. (My favorite mussels, BTW, is Bouchon or ACote in Berkeley). All in all though, it's still a decent main course.

I'm usually not a fan of desserts, but I love creme brulee and Comme Ca makes a solid one. You can see the bits of vanilla bean in every bite of custard, and the hard caramel is caramelized perfectly. I also had a bite of the pot de creme (orange was the flavor of the day) and it's a light, clean, and refreshing dessert.

All in all, it is really a bang for your buck kind of meal. I've also tried a couple things on the regular meal, and I really liked the oxtail benedict (oxtail is very tender and it's a solid eggs benedict) and the duck and pork belly ""cinnamon"" roll (sweet and savory dish that is very interesting).

This place is quite affordable if you have someone to share your meals with. My friend and I ordered quite a lot and our total was probably $60 with taxes and tips for 2 ppl. We had: 

- The Sampler Platter w/ Hümmus, Babaganüj, and Tabülè. In order of preference, I have to say Tabülè was the clear winner. It's so refreshing and I didn't expect to like it. Tabule at Paramount Find Foods is not even comparable. Depending on your preference, Babaganüj might be a bit too sweet. Personally, I prefer Hümmus and then the Babaganüj. You get pita bread with these spreads and can ask for free refills. If you get this platter, try one of the spreads with Tabule. 
- Cauliflower, was soft and pretty tasty. Nice little appetizer but not filling if that's what you are looking for. 
- Falafel, kind of too crunchy for me but also delicious and a tiny bit spicy. But I'm really sensitive to spicy food. My friend couldn't taste it at all though. Lol. 
- Lentil Soup (bowl size). It was okay, but since there is no cream or butter.. Not as smooth for me. Idk. I think I prefer it with some creamy texture so, probably pass on this one next time. Paramount makes a really great Lentil soup FYI. 
- Kefta, also good. The mixed lamb and beef tasted a bit salty but was balanced by the rice. We were honestly stuffed but had to try it before packing it to go. 

I would definitely come back here. Perhaps to try the Labni (a homemade Lebanese yogurt spread) and the teas. We spotted some diners with the Garlic Tomatoes dish, which looked interesting too. Yeah, we are foodies that eye other people's dishes for future reference. Lool.",2016-01-04 04:04:53

I asked the gentleman behind the counter to put it into the larger cup because of the extra bananas that I paid for. He began to tell me that only sometimes does the banana actually need a bigger cup. When he handed me my smoothie I looked at the blender and it still had a large amount of smoothie left in there which he threw away I was so mad. I went to this location the day before and they happily gave me a larger cup. Thanks for wasting ingredients and my money!!,2018-03-23 15:38:23

Setting itself is pretty nice, a great escape from a somewhat grungy stretch of Queen W.

Now food was all great!  The Reina arepa basically tasted like guac with chunks of chicken.  The corn bread is very subtle tasting, with just a hint of corn.

Mojito with brown sugar cane - Just hit the spot for a warm afternoon, after a stressful morning.  It was also a great, albeit temporary, escape to a tropical island!

Tres leche cake - Came in a rather small ramekin, as opposed to a slice which I've had before at another Toronto eatery.  Size was rather small for $6.50 price point, but well presented.

As previously stated, the wings were dry and chewy, overly so. 

Let me begin this rant by stating I can't stand the fact that they have the following slogan plastered all over the walls of their locations, the staff's t-shirts and headlining their website:

Warning:
MEDIUM is HOT
MEDIUM-HOT is VERY HOT
HOT is VERY, VERY HOT

First of all. The MEDIUM is comparable to a watered down Tobasco. The MEDIUM HOT is probably straight Tobasco. The HOT is probably Tobasco w/ Frank's. Bottom line the wings here are not that hot at all. I was so dissatisfied with the heat I had to order a side of DEATH sauce, the 2nd hottest sauce they had on their menu. Even that received a beat down. I would love to go back to smash their Armageddon sauce, the hottest sauce they offer but I can't justify spending any more $ at this establishment. Also, where do they get the balls to name their spiciest wing Armageddon, didn't All-Stars own that long before them? Regardless, you would think this heat mission statement was coined by a 4 yr old as far away from India as possible. 

In addition to this scoville mockery, I also ordered the spicy BBQ which was nothign special at all. It was so evident this sauce came out of a 3L jug and simpley did not taste good at all.  

To top off the whole experience, we ordered onion scoops only to find a piece of paper in one of them. A small square rectangular piece of yellow paper inside an onion scoop!!! It was unchewable and clearly some form of wax paper as it was fibrous. We informed our waitress and she only took the nearly full basket of scoops away from our table and off our bill, that's it. I couldn't help but notice these are also the exact same onion scoops that All-Stars carries. 

Believe me I hate ranting on establishments, I really do. But this experience was rough. However, despite this 1* review I am certain this Duff's location will still thrive. It was packed the Sunday night I was in there and the parking lot consistently remains to be so.

On the only positive note service was good and staff were attentive. There were a fair amount of LCD's scattered around the restaurant which makes it a good venue to watch football and other sporting events. 

Overall though a terrible experience at Duff's. Such a shame as it is less then a 1 minute drive from my house and they have a nice patio. I still to this day have not had better wings than Turtlejack's, anywhere.",2010-11-23 15:12:55

Very cool that you can see the grill and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. Bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks.

The wings are some of the best in the valley! Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use.

The ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants. We had fried zucchini and fried mushrooms as well because my gf's parents ordered them... Everything was more than satisfying and we all had a great dinner! Worth a shot for sure!

The coconut chicken soup with mushrooms was excellent. As was the wonton soup. 

The basil rolls were good, not great. And they were very small.

The larb was very dry and not at all spicy, which was very disappointing. The pad Thai and the pas see ew were also both dry, and the pad see ew was low on flavor.

We also bought the duck salad, which was decent.

Overall, for the amount we paid, I expected a slightly higher quality of food. Next time I'll likely try a different place for anything other than the soup.",2016-03-07 02:03:38

Our group of seven (including bride and groom) were picked up in a limo from our hotel and transported to the chapel.  Although I didn't personally pay for the package, it also included the flowers and the photographer (in addition to the round-trip limo).  Once we arrived, we had a short time to take pictures before the ceremony started.  There was first a quick ceremony with an ordained minister (I think), and then a longer, more fun ceremony that was led by Elvis himself.  It was awesome.  The groom was Jewish so they even allowed us to do the ""mazel tov"" aka breaking of the glass.

Four stars only because there was a bit of a mix-up with the flowers and when Elivis arrived, he had to be reminded what the bride and groom's names were... other than that, it was pretty flawless.  

We took some of our own pictures in the side courtyard afterwards.  It seems that this place is crazy busy.  Our limo driver was on a tight schedule and there were ceremonies right before and after ours as well.

I have to admit this restaurant became one of my  favorite Hawaiian plate lunch place in Las Vegas.    They have all standard Hawaiian plates, but have taken to another level with their own twist that separate themselves from the others in Las Vegas.

The wait time can be a little long, but looking and tasting what the owners are making in back is freshly made, and not sitting in a warmer.   The restaurant was playing a few old Hawaiian songs, and it was pretty cool to listening them. 

My plate came out within ten minutes, and all of  the order came out on a take out plate, but I was there for the food, and their Ahi Tofu patty was outstanding, and had a nice mellow miso sauce on it.     The Garlic Chicken came with a soy sauce/mayo dip, this dish is a winner.    But it's their Sheared furikaki  Ahi roll, which has a very nice special sauce, that captures most of the locals.       
I was even more impressive with their green salad, which had a tart miso vinaigrette. 

I tried all of the Hawaiian eateries, but this place kills all of them in the Las Vegas valley.     When you're in this place, you forget you're in Las Vegas. and your taste buds are somehow  taking you somewhere to Pearl City, Maui, or a hole in the wall on the Big Island.

Initially, I spoke with Dan - - I hope I got the name correct - - and he showed me a bike that would fit my needs and my price point and I figured out my sizing, which was very helpful because I had also been looking at used bikes and new or used it's an investment and sizing is important.  There is no hard pressure sales here at all.  He answered all the questions I had.  That same Friday I stopped into to rent a bike for a group ride Saturday with another store.

At this point this was my third weekend riding.  Natasha was the leader of this ride.  Everyone was super friendly, helpful and supportive, which I am quickly learning is very common in the cycling world.  There were members of Mcghie's (males) that assisted in whatever mechanical issues arose and gave tips along the ride and made sure everyone stayed together no matter what your level. After there was cupcakes and coffee.  

That same day I received an email from Chris letting me know that if I did find a used bike to bring it in and have it checked out or to contact him if I had any other questions about bikes they had available.

This is a fantastic place and I'd recommend it to any person looking for cheap sushi. I can't think of another place in downtown Toronto that provides cheap sushi that's still tasty and comes with friendly service. 

The sushi roll selection is standard for Toronto and will likely have your favourites. The thing with cheap sushi places is that typically the fish isn't too flavourful. That is the case with this place, but even so it doesn't have too much of that frozen taste quality that other joints do. Also nice is the fact that their rice is very nicely seasoned, providing a bit of a kick to the whole roll.

But perhaps my favourite thing overall, is the free roll or side dish they give without fail to my take out orders. I've had the chance to try new rolls for free which has lead me to order them later. 

This place is also staffed by some really nice folk. They talk to you and ask you about your day. This can be a bit of a rarity in any restaurant you visit, so I found the experience a nice change.

It was about 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and then almost 10 before we got our drinks (1 iced tea and a beer).  It was then another 10 before our order was taken. (The place was semi-busy but not slammed and I saw other servers just standing around at times) We started with the Eggplant Pizzette which were INCREDIBLE with tiny dollops of ricotta (4.5 stars).  We ordered the The Di Fara Special pizza (thin style).  The eggplant came within 20 minutes.  When we were finished a man came over and informed us that our pizza had looked over cooked so they started a new one (He looked to be the manager but never identified himself as such).  About  20 more minutes later the pizza was finally delivered to our table.  It was a great pizza-one of the best I have had in Vegas(4 stars) but given how long it took, it put a slight damper on the whole experience. ( It probably didn't help that the table next to us was seated with 3 very loud and pompous narcissistic  blow-hards that couldn't stop talking even long enough to eat their own food which seem to come out pretty quickly despite the fact that they were seated after us.) 

The manager came to check on us 3x which was good intentions-wise but did little else to make up for the long wait and he responded with a ""fantastic"" in each of our interactions as though he was on automated response.  Almost 2 hours later we left with our bill-our waitress notified us that the manager had graciously removed the price of my iced tea (REALLY???).  Our waitress was very personable.

The decor and atmosphere are really nice-loved the outdoor patio- the music was a bit loud which made it hard to talk  at times.   We are wanting to give this place another chance because the food was good and all restaurants can have bad nights. ..",2012-12-04 04:06:54

Elliot - Our server was a delightful, kind and impressive person.
The kind of service and attention to details were spectacular! The food prep and serving was beautiful. 

Reservations:
I took the vegetarian/vegan meal and my hubby chose white meat diet. They take these details while you call for booking and then they call you back to reconfirm your reservations.

Food: 
They shared the pre-fix menu choices for lunch and for me they mentioned all that they have. and then they started to serve. wow! Not only the presentation of the food was unique but the food as well. We started goat cheese and pesto lollipops & popcorns and a choice of wine, the bottled to be shared between two of us and left over was given to take home. We chose white wine and we got again a delicious French wine (Chartier), which is like 20$ in LCBO and then we were served taro/oregano- truffled cappuccino & shrimp cappuccino(Hubby). The side of bread (we had choices) with 3 kinds of butter, I loved the flower butter. The bread was freshly baked and aromatic.

Now for the mains, I had Quash/cashew Patty along with a fried roll. So yum! so so so yum! It was smoked and garnished with red quinoa. My hubby chose Foi Gras, he got it along with mushroom shaped breads served in a book box, a fried roll and a smoothie(I wish I was served too). the smoothie was beet/green apple and was delicious. 

For second mains, I had roots with hummus- delicious, roots were steamed to perfection, to compliment they had served the side of sweet quinoa and salty sauteed mushrooms.Oh so yum! My hubby had some Bass, which was first smoked in the grass and was shown to him for his approval to serve. 

Now the dessert:
Some berry mouse with sorbet- oh so delicious so perfectly sweetened, along with blueberry cotton candy tree and Meringue to share. Then we got a choice of coffee and tea. they served Nespresso coffee along with Tea cakes (In a to-go box, so that you can take the leftovers). 

Well, It's not over yet.

We also received an autograph from the chef, a jar of eggplant caviar, a big Meringue to take home along with tea cakes and wine.

It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.

Our reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.

Postino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.

Granted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.

We took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.",2014-12-17 21:29:26

The only weird issue about this mall is that it's kind of confusing.  It's not really a square, not really a circle, but it's more of an octagon shape with some weird intersections, so it's very easy to get somewhat lost.

Within 12 hours of posting the review, I was contacted by Shane, the District Manager of Goodyear in hopes of resolving the issue. This is the quickest response from management I've ever received after a discrepancy. I am blown away by how apologetic and accomadating Shane was. 

Prior to contacting me, he had pulled up my invoice and admitted that there was certainly a mistake that was made. He offered me a refund of the overcharged $100 and an explanation. 

This was simply a misunderstanding with a new staff member who was not informed of the promotions in place. From what I understand after the explanation from Shane, Goodyear does offer the ceramic pads at the promotion price. 

I don't exactly understand what the original sales employee had tried explaining to me at the time of payment about the different brake pads that are used, but Shane assured me that Goodyear stocks quality centric pads.

I didn't love the shang beef noodle soup. It was good and filling but I think I enjoyed every other item ordered (including the Dan Dan noodles) more than the soup. I even enjoyed all the individual parts of the soup. I just didn't care much for the broth. Hopefully there's another broth more to my liking because this place overall is really good.

I had the tartufo, and I was so appreciative of their letting me make a couple of changes.  I ordered it without the olives and added shrimp, and it was AMAZING!  I could definitely tell that the noodles were homemade, and the sauce was perfection.  It was a cream sauce but wasn't super heavy like most, and how can you go wrong with truffles, right?!  The shrimp were delicious, and I'm very picky about shrimp.  What was even better was the fact that the tails were off!  I really will never understand why so many restaurants choose to leave the tails on shrimp.  My fiancé ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli with meat sauce.

I feel the same way, the pizza is ok and I have had better in Vegas. 

The pizza is good. It is not bad, but not great. For a chain, I think the taste is just okay but better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. The waitress forget my iced tea I ordered then charged me for it. When I brought it to her attention she said she would take it off the receipt, but no apology for forgetting. 

What I don't like is their prices and their add toppings per topping and pay per topping. I got a personal white pizza (enough for 1 meal if you are really hungry or 2 meals if you are not that hungry). It has 6 small/medium sized slices. The base price is $10 for a personal sized white pizza. Add artichoke hearts $4, add mushrooms $2, add spinach $2, add mushrooms $2. My pizza is now $20 for a personal size pizza! Hmm did my pizza have truffles on it for that price? I did not even get my sun dried tomatoes or extra garlic because it would cost more $$! I think this is a rip off. You are better off getting large pizzas and splitting them if your party can agree to the pizza type. They really should come up with some pizzas that have the toppings already on there. If you think you are being customized by allowing toppings to be placed on for additional charges, it does not work when it becomes highly overpriced. Well this is a big company and I highly doubt they will ever change their method of pricing per topping, so in that case I highly doubt I would be back (not by my choice). 

We did get a free cheesecake for teacher appreciation week and I got strawberry. I was not impressed with the consistency of the cheesecake, it was soft (way too soft and yes there is such a thing). I like a firmer more dense cheesecake personally. The strawberries were kind of odd baked into the cheesecake, so they got weird mushy.

The meat seems to be at its best the earlier you come, but if you walk in around midnight, it can be just a little too dry. 3.5 stars rounded to 4 because of good service, nice big space, and late kitchen hours (rare for downtown).",2010-10-05 20:42:34

Some notes of interest:
The staff is extremely friendly
The food is extremely fresh and tasty
The Zoe's app/online ordering is AWESOME
They have an outdoor seating area overlooking the Southpark towers fountain, Fairview Rd and the SouthPark Mall (and yes, there are umbrellas for shade)
They serve beer and wine
They offer cheap refills if you purchase the Zoes cup
They reward you for loyalty when you submit your Zoes receipts (you get goodies!)

Don't let the lines scare you off. There are lines because the food is delicious and they have an awesome location for a lot of office workers that just walk to get their lunch. If you're in a hurry and just need to quickly pick something up, order ahead, and get in the special line for to-go orders, where you simply confirm your order and pick it up. They do not charge your card until you arrive and pick up your food, so you can pay with alternative methods or add things on if you like.

Also, they have the best Greek salad I've ever eaten, it's delicious! My favorite is the Tossed Greek Salad, that comes with grilled chicken and onions, and pasta salad over the salad. Don't worry carb-avoiders, you can subsitute or remove the pasta salad!

Reminder: Submit your receipts using the zoes app for free goodies!",2014-06-11 14:50:11

The milk bread cinnamon roll is life changing, and they know how to make some killer pasta. The second time I ate here was for lunch with some friends on a Saturday after hitting the Farmer's market just down the street. It's much more affordable at lunch time but still a bit more on the pricey side of the local options.

Check in - slow but expected and understandable - 30min

Room gorgeous - tasteful and modern.  The alarm clock, curtains, lights, TV and music were all controlled by an iPad type device beside the bed.  You are supposively able to check out with this pad as well, but the servies were down while we were there so we couldn't try it out.

Housekeeping - poor, Upon check in, was hoping to lay down and rest, however there was a big white starchy stain on the comforter, stain was dead center in plain sight.  Disgusted, called Front desk to remove that and left to play a few games.  Came back, bed was remade but the same stain was still there.  Called again and had it redone.  We went to buy a few beers before returning to the room experience. 
 
Service - poor, there is no bottle opener in the room, so I called to have one brought up.  Great.  Next day, room service removed the bottle opener, not sure why as I clearly had a few more beers on the counter.  Call for a new one.  20min pass, called back and room service said no record of one being requested.  10min later the bottle opener arrives.  40 min later, another knock on the door and a second bottle opener is delivered

In room dining service - poor, I preemptively ordered a fruit platter and chocolate covered strawberries to surprise my parents in another room.  2 weeks before our flight into vegas I called back to confirm that everyone was set up.  I was told there is no record of my order.  So, I reordered.  Upon arrival, there was nothing in my parent's room.  2 hours later the fruit platter and strawberries were delivered, but to MY room.  Went to the concierge to complain but she was not helpful.  Called front desk from my room to have this delivered to my parents room instead, in spite of ruining the surprise.

Checkout - good, did it on the phone.",2013-01-27 19:47:05

Server was great and first off we ordered a round of shots for the Birthday boy, this took 10 minutes. No biggie. She finally came back and we ordered appetizers, Seafood platter and 2 Roast Beet Salads. 
This seemed to take forever again. Finally after 40 minutes she returned and took dinner orders. 
More bread baskets, more drinks, no bus service, dirty dishes stacking up. 
After 1 hour and 40 minutes, meals finally came out, 2 of were plated wrong, watched as the server removed a Lobster Tail off one plate and relocate to another. After the confusion of trying to convince the food runners who ordered what, we were set. 
I ordered the French Onion soup, was very good. Also had the Filet, which was good too. Wifey had the Prime Rib and hers was good as well. Our friend had the Petit Lobster tail. It was cooked down to mush. Sent back. Our Son had the Surf n Turf. Steak was good, jumbo Lobster Tail was raw in the middle, sent back. Another 15 minutes, they brought back the Lobsters, the small one was perfectly cooked, Jumbo was of course still raw and cold in the center...we were running on 2 hours by this time and he just ate the cooked parts.

This is mainly because I often travel alone and prefer to dine in the bar or lounge area of the restaurant so I don't take up a whole table by myself. I've done that and it's awkward. It also nice to chat with the bartenders, especially when they have real personalities as they do at the Mirage. 

On this trip I just wanted a water and something simple, so I ordered the Prime Rib Nachos. They came out quickly and were excellent. I wouldn't say there were overwhelming portions of meat on them, but it was certainly adequate. The overall size of the nacho plate was so large I think I only got through about half of it. 

This is a nice lounge to people watch. It's right by the front entrance, main desk, and in the middle of the indoor tropical forest area complete with waterfalls. I could sit here for hours and in fact, I have in the past when I had a lot of time to kill. The staff are pretty consistent and by now remember me. Like a lot of places in Vegas, their nametags also show where they're from. So that's often a great conversation starter. 

There are two TVs here which usually show sports. There are also several video poker games right on the bar. If you look straight up, you'll see the sky because a huge glass dome is directly above you. It's very scenic but can also be quite bright. I've seen people sitting at the bar wearing sunglasses certain times of the day, not to look cool mind you but to keep from going blind.

FWIW, the service was not bad. Our server was friendly and quite prompt... once he knew he was our server. Considering that the place was basically empty at 10pm on a Tuesday, there shouldn't be so much confusion.

Farm Cafe boasts that as many as their ingredients as can be are locally sourced. When available. So who really knows what comes from where.

The food here is relatively uninspired. What it clearly aims to be is a generic casino cafe restaurant, but their prices aren't very cheap nor is there anything that screams 'interesting' on the menu.

I ordered a meatloaf ""tower."" I emphasize the word tower because in fact it was just a single slice of meatloaf. I'm not exactly sure how that qualifies as any sort of tall structure. The meatloaf was decent as was the gravy, but the onion strings were overdone and the plate consisted primarily of average mashed potatoes. The best item on the dish was the vegetables, which there were far too few of.

Their only downfall, it was a Friday evening and the place was packed. They had their windows open and it was quite warm out and the place was smoldering. We asked the waitress to have the manager turn on the AC, which he did, but the windows were open, so it didn't make much of a difference.

And the fries...I was not a fan of the fries initially.  But on my recent visit I noticed that they had a whiteboard that listed where today's potatoes came from.  I can't remember where they came from, but they were delicious!  Nice golden color with a crispy-ish outside and soft inside.    So perhaps the fry quality depends on their origin.  And this time they were lightly dusted with the Cajun seasoning, not caked in it.

Five Guys is relatively new to Vegas, so perhaps their QC is still combing through each location.  This location now seems to be up to par, and is now a reliable option for those times where I just need to have a burger.",2011-10-27 19:44:16

(The last time I had one was at Johnny Bistro's which also was made with a black bean patty.)  I especially liked the abundance of goat cheese in it.

K got the Miso Sesame Tuna Bowl which I was really impressed about as well.  Jack Astor's seems to have improved their game!

I moved to Arizona from Chicago. I'm a die-hard Gino's East fan, and quite simply there's nothing else to compare. Granted- I have other pies that I've come to love in my day, and those are magnificent for what they are. But for Jimmy's to advertise themeselves as 'Jimmy's of Chicago'... for me, being who I am, I feel like that's disingenuous and predatory.

Try a few pies in Chicago and you'll quickly learn what Chicago pizza is all about. Now, I just placed a phone order with Jimmy's, and I set myself up for (what I was hoping would be) a tasty pie. It was delivered, credit card slip was signed, and that was that.

Then I open the box.

... WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LIMP PIECE OF CLOWN-ASS DOUGH-PLATE?!!?!?

You make a pie like this in the 'K' streets, you come down to the Southside, and that's when bad things happen to good people. I also ordered some clams- and these people have the nerve... THE FUCKING NERVE... to stuff clamshells full of breading, stuffing, and (God I hope) minced clam meat, then put it on the menu.

You know what...? Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I missed some sort of fine print. Maybe I didn't read the disclaimer. Maybe I should have read a little deeper. But go fuckyaselves- tonight, I wanted a good deep dish Chicago pie, and was willing to try something new (clams with pizza??!?! sounds good!!!). This order bit me in the ass and I'm willing to live with that. And maybe I'll try them out again and they'll blow me out of the water- I'm willing to hope so. But for now- TWO STARS.

Burger was prepared pretty quickly after ordering.
Went a little after 1 PM so it was pretty empty. Headed upstairs to take a look and there was a huge poster for the habanero.

Upon revealing the contents of the wrapper, the burger looked pretty much as it is advertised, which is something I usually don't see when it comes to fast-food burger chains. I definitely don't see it when I get McDonalds, or Burger King, or Harvey's..

In terms of flavor, it's not really spicy at all. Maybe it's the sauce they use that has a little heat.

The room was bright and airy at this location with a clean sleek look and clear sight lines along the open kitchen and bar seating up near where the cooking is happening. Since it was frigid and windy that January evening, with few people braving the weather, we were the only table after the other one vacated and the temperature seemed to be chillier in the restaurant than what warm Italian food should be enjoyed at. They needed to add a double door or at least a To-style curtain in front of the doorway to stop the cold draft from coming in. 
The carbonara was delicious with the smoked bacon not greasy and the pasta cooked to a nice al dente perfection. I also tried the pizza which was tasty and had a nice chewy crust making it easily devoured. The casual atmosphere went well the cab sauvignon. They had a neat Yelp check-in offer of a free dessert so I ordered the Tiramisu which was different and a little lighter than the usual with its ladyfingers for the cake part.

I had always trusted that they did.  Well, be ware. The last time my oil was changed, my windshield wiper fluid was bone dry. I had noticed the place was unusually dead. I had mentioned to the guy that the windshield fluid was completely empty and he told me that is the first thing they do is top off the fluids. I also noticed that their prices had really gone up since my last oil change. Anyway they were finished with the oil change in record time. When I was on my way home I tried the windshield wipers, and it was still bone dry. So my concern was if they didn't even fill my wiper fluid, then they obviously didn't check the radiator fluid, break fluid, power steering fluid, transmission fluid. Last time I checked, they are considered fluids, are they not? So I went to auto parts store and got some wiper fluid which they should have taken care of for the price they charge. My radiator fluid is low, and so is the break fluid. Well I called them back and spoke to the service manager and asked him what kind of an operation they run over there? He claims he had no idea the guy didn't check my fluids and told me to bring the car back, but I already lost confidence in them at this point. So the bottom line is they have a sign out front that lists all the things they do with the oil change, which I might add is NOT cheap, and all they did was change the oil.

I have been here a few times getting your run of the mill stuff- trash bags, paint, a pick to expand the hole in my basement- the usual. My only negative experience until recently was I bought a grill that came with free assembly but whoever assembles them was apparently on vacation and couldn't do it for a week or so -so I put it together myself and am now terrified that it will explode. 

Last night, however, when I went to get a drink from my trusty fridge my taste buds were assaulted by water that could loosely be called ""tap"". Surely this must be a mistake, I mused out loud, because I had just replaced the filter not two months prior. I checked the filter light and it was not on- I was allegedly good. I tasted the water again and sure enough- it was disgusting, unfiltered proletariat water. ""THIS WILL NOT STAND!"" I screamed, picking up the bell I ring to alert my butler to my needs. After ringing it for about 45 minutes I realized my roomate was not in fact home and I would have to take care of this myself. 3 hours later I had figured out how to remove the filter and was looking online for a replacement. 

Now, according to the home depot website there were a variety of products they offered that would fit my needs. There was a name brand, a generic, and each offered them in a single or two pack. The two pack of the generic was the best value but since I'm a BALLER I planned on getting the single of the name brand because I make it rain like that. The website has a cool feature entitled ""check for availability in store"" and what this feature does is it allows you to check for the availability of your product in the store. I checked and sure enough- all four were available at this location. 

To recap- they allegedly have 4 different products that will fit my needs in stock. So I jump in my automobile, smash the accelematrix and I'm off. At the last possible second a nagging voice in the back of my mind said, ""you know what,just in case why don't you bring the old filter with you- worst case scenario you can just throw it out in the store when you buy the new one"". While I am usually a risk taker -I play the stock market, blackjack, go out with girls who live downtown- for some reason I listened to aforementioned voice and brought it with me.

I arrived at the store and by the time I had walked 20 feet had been asked by about 7 employees if they could help me. Having been worn down I said ""You know what Steve? You can"". I showed him the website for what I wanted and he said ""No problem"". Little did Steve know- there was a big problem. Apparently water filters are slightly more valuable than plutonium so they are always kept hidden or under lock and key or both. At this particular location apparently they are also kept in like 5 different locations. After walking around for some time it turned out the product was not available in store- a major defect in the ""check availability in store"" system. Not only was my first choice not available, neither were any of the other ones. 

:(

At this point another employee overheard us talking and informed us there was in fact a secret 6th location where filters could be found. Once we found this El Dorado of tap water it turned out they did have the generic filter in a one pack that I needed- but the price was like 14 dollars more than advertised on the website. At this point I had invested 5's of minutes into getting it though so I bit the bullet and shelled out the money instead of ordering online/waiting for it. 

In closing, Amazon for little shippable things. Home depot for other things. This review is slightly exaggerated- but I emphasize SLIGHT.",2014-05-07 20:11:24

I knew before the reservation was made that my fiancé and I would be doing there tasting menu. As soon as we arrived we were seated and ordered our drinks. I really like that all there beers are draft. The house bread was good crunchy but chewy in the middle. Our first course was a sample of pickled vegetables. It was bright and I could taste each component on its own but not something I would order again.  Second course was a grilled radicchio salad with anchovies. Now I have tried to avoid these little fish by all means. When I hear anchovy I picture little buggy eyes staring up at me from a tin can. However that was not the case. The salad was good. A little heavy on the dressing and carried the vinegar flavor over from the first course. It was good but also something I wouldn't order on my own again. At this point our beer was gone and it was time to move on to something a little stronger. We both ordered cocktails. I chose mercy of the bartender and got something that was a little bubbly but reminded me of Yeager.  I'm guessing its from the bitters which is not quite my thing. My fiancé got a rev dr Daniel hall which I liked. Third course was house made sausage with lentil and pig belly. This was by far my favorite dish. It was spicy, creamy and crunchy. It was definitely the star of our meal. The fourth course was seared yellowfin tuna with fingering potatoes olives and a miso-gribiche sauce. This was also just good. I wish the sear was a little darker. All the components were served slightly warm which was ok I was just hoping for something hot and hearty on a cold night. Desert was good I had a brûlée that was very good and the fiancé got a poached pear with biscotti. The wine that was paired with my dessert (somas nectar) was so good we bought a bottle to take home. All and all it was a very nice meal. I was hopping for something a little more robust on a cold night. If there was a theme to the dinner it would have been pickling. Which they do well. The service was top notch and a different server brought out each dish and was able to explain it.  It was a nice meal but I think next time we go well be ordering from the menu.",2013-11-14 12:47:56

You can walk around for several hours without retracing your steps, and most of it is very quiet, we didn't see people for several minutes at a time.  And it's in the middle of Gilbert.

Wildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.  Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.

Wildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.  The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.  I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.  The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.  The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.

My wife got the chopped salad which was excellent and very unique.  I think they stole it from Cowboy Caio.

If it's late...if it's a weekend...prepare to pay a cover.  IMO, an Irish pub shouldn't be the type of place to attract crowds that pay cover charges.  This actually destroys any cred that I'd give to an Irish pub in the first place.  Disappointing!

The decor...the interior...the layout...pretty damn nice.  The bar and layout is exacty what I expect from a traditional Irish pub.  For a narrow layout anyhow.  The bar itself is about as authentic as you can get.  Very nice!

The atmosphere is nice when you're here early and bellied-up.  The patio is also nice for enjoying the evening.  Weekend nights...just say no!  The crowd is a grab-bag of disappointment.

Which leaves us with the food...it's food.  If it's late...and you paid the cover...and you're hungry...go ahead.  If you're not at Rí Rá, and you're hungry...there are many other fine options.

This location plays  very loud music walking through the store from downstairs to upstairs where the plus size section is I noticed employees in  standing around groups talking and being loud playful I immediately thought wow this must be a fun store to work for. As I got upstairs I didn't see very many employees. You can definitely tell the difference. 
It must of been a long time since I've gone to forever 21 because I noticed the sizing was a little different. Before I would buy jeans by my size but in the plus size section I noticed some jeans were sized Lg XL 2X and so on not knowing what size I would fall in I went In search of an employee in the whole plus size section there was no one around. 
Walking more toward the rear of the store on the second floor I found the sale area. I was appalled by the view of the area. Clothes on the floor every where , the whole area was a hot mess. When I found an employee I asked her what are the size equivalence she looked at me weird , thinking I asked wrongly I repeated my question differently ( I didn't catch her name because she had her tag tucked in her shirt) she said ""how would I know what size U would be only U would know and if U don't the only way to find out was to try them on ( I wanted to slap my head) I work retail when someone asks me a question about sizing we know how to answer those questions based of the brand. Does Forever 21 not train staff on sizing? What if I was buying a gift and only knew she wore size 18 how would they be able to help me if she wasn't there to try it on?

Fear of talking too loudly aside, we had an amazing meal.

First of all, the biggest issue with every restaurant: were their cocktails good? 
Yes! And accurate too! It pleases me so to see aperitifs and classic cocktails. Where else can you get a Blood and Sand? Answer: not sure, but I really enjoy theirs. It also made me so happy to see a proper Papa Doble. Hemingway would be proud - he would also devour the pork shoulder I had, braised in Applejack on top a square of perfect polenta. And possibly order a second. Seriously, the best piece of pork I've ever had.

The menu changes a lot depending on what the chef gets for the week or so. When we went it was pickled vegetable time, so I was disappointed not to be able order the tallow fries I saw weeks beforehand. But that's what a good restaurant does to keep you coming back.

The dining room needs to be warmed up a bit. It's minimalist without the minimalist design. I hear they're painting the walls, so that's a good sign. They are still new. However, our server (who was about the same age as us) was so polite and proper that it made me uncomfortable. Strange, I know, but I felt out-fancied.

One thing about the ambience I did love was the music. Light and hip, and a perfect balance.

Shrimp Tempura Meal: served with the best miso soup I have ever had. It wasn't overly salty like other misos I've had (especially towards the bottom). The salad was pretty good as well, but nothing to write home about. The tempura was on par with some of the best tempura I've ever had. 

Sushi dinner (2 rolls)
Las Vegas Roll: spicy tuna, cream cheese, spicy mayo, eel sauce. One of the best fried rolls I've ever had. It was really, really good. 
Show Me the Love: spicy yellowtail, tuna, salmon, screaming O sauce (similar to spicy mayo). We fought over who got the last piece of this roll, on my birthday. That was how amazing it was. 

Fatty Tuna: I didn't try any, but it looked and I was told it tasted, good. 
Blue Fin Tuna: Again, I didn't get to try any, it didn't look like anything special, and was told it was unlikely that it was actually Blue Fin. :(

They brought me out a tempura banana dessert for my birthday. It was really sweet on the part of our server, and put a damper on us getting dessert somewhere else afterwards, but I was okay with that. :P

$60 for the amount of food we got was awesome. That's about how much we normally spend on all you can eat, and we got just as full but the rolls were better (although we probably won't put the AYCE place out of our list of go-tos).",2013-10-24 06:43:52

Ill admit I was skeptical of the led light treatment, but with a chin full of underground pimples ready to rear their ugly heads, I was desperate. Honestly, they went away. It is 3 days later and my skin is plump and glowing and the under grounders have dissipated ! I am thrilled!

The room, full of clusters of small tables was absolutely packed when we walked in. Our makeshift table for four was puzzle-pieced together with two differently sized two-tops and one of my friends sharing a curiously two sided floating banquette with someone from a neighbouring table.

The food was excellent.

The extremely moist peas pulao, fluffy plain basmati, roti, and butter naan were all great accompaniments too. 

There was a really large staff on hand who seemed to enjoy standing in a row behind the counter, watching the happy diners. The service was incredibly friendly with orders sent immediately via PDA and constant water refills.

Over the last two weeks I think it's safe to say we've ordered around half the menu.

From the starters (we) worked our way down starting with the Tuna Poke, the Fully Loaded Nachos, the Fish and Chicken Tacos and the Pulled Pork Poutine, out of the Small shared plates, the Crispy Calamari and the Banh mi style Jerk Chicken Sandwich. My favorites being the chicken and fish tacos, both deep fried and just super tasty. A giant amount of salad/slaw in each, which is a bood or bad thing. 

The Tuna Club and Crispy Chicken were my personal highlights; the tuna was seared, toasted and layered perfectly while the chicken was unbelievably crispy while being perfectly moist.

The most incredible play I have ever seen and I have a hard time believing I will ever see a play to top it! I cannot speak highly enough about this production and a shoutout to Ovens Auditorium for the venue.

The production itself was a masterpiece. There were two specific acts that have been etched into my memory. The first was the scene in which Jean Valjean was dragging Marius through the tunnel. I was convinced this was done on a video screen, but then Valjean began to appear closer and closer and finally emerged from the tunnel with Marius. 

The second was the suicide of Javert. The effects used here displayed Javert slowly falling by pulling him backward through a dark, dusky fog. The echo of his falling sounded quite realistic. 

The cast was unreal. In an effort to keep my review short I will say that the vocal performances were shockingly off the charts. I was amazed at how great the actors sounded and brilliantly they nailed all their lines.

The best thing going for this hotel & casino is the location. It's a very short walk from the room elevators to the middle of the action on Fremont Street. I'd say literally 1-2 minutes from elevator to Fremont (depending upon how fast you walk). 

But be forewarned, the rooms are very tiny and you've got almost no counter space (see photos). Put it this way, I'm a guy. I shave my head. My counter space needs are about as minimal as they come. But I found navigating the bathroom extremely challenging. I almost had to use the bathtub ledge to place a few items. 

The toilet is right there by the sink, too. You could literally sit on the toilet and shave in the mirror at the same time. I didn't, because it would be creepy. But you could. 

The room is pretty much a bed and TV. The bed takes up more than half the room. The closet is adequate. So all in all, just a very tight room but it serves the purpose. I slept well here. Staff were professional and had no issues to complain of. 

Again, the major advantage of staying at the Fremont is the access to Fremont St where everything happens. If you just want a room to crash in, this is a good option.

It closes on weekends, making it difficult for me to visit. We arrived right after the lunch rush, and were greeted by two of the staff. The menu is small but appropriate for the type of establishment. It had falafel, shawarma, grape leaves, Mediterranean salad, and yogurt called Labni. 

For appetizers, we decided on the grape leaves. After that, we ordered the falafel platter which included a Mediterranean salad, hummus and tahini dipping sauce.  We also ordered the lamb/beef shawarma plate and substituted the rice with Labni.  Their version of hot sauce, called schug, was also order for $.95 extra.

Grape leaves had a nice presentation but were served cold. The coldness made them firm, bordering on hard. They had a great spices mix and lemonony flavor. They seem similar to the canned grape leaves I have purchased many times before from Mediterranean establishments. Either way, they were tasty and I would order them again, but slightly heated. 

The falafel were definitely good, crunchy on the outside soft yet not greasy on the inside. They were not great but they were tasty. The tahini sauce needed more salt. It did have a nice texture and worked very well with the falafel.  The Mediterranean salad was chopped very diligently and had a nice fresh taste and made a great addition to the falafel. The hummus was creamy but also need a bit more salt and garlic.  The lamb/beef shawarma pita sandwich was surprisingly light. Wrapped in a grilled pita along with Mediterranean salad, the meat was well spiced and not fatty. I substituted Lebni for my rice, it was thick and slightly sour as it should.  I do believe this lebni was store-bought and not made in house. Also, the pita bread, grilled nicely and definitely fresh, was just your regular, every day store-bought pita bread. It would be a nice touch for this restaurant to have a different type of pita bread such as handmade or fluffier pita bread. The surprise, for me, was the hot sauce. It was called schug, and had a nice strong kick. I added it to every bite I took of falafel or shawarma. 

For dessert, we ordered the Malawach, a cheese- filo pastry that came with tomato chutney. It was extremely fresh, not over dry considering it was made with filo dough, and had a real nice savory flavor to it. Definitely a great way to end the meal. 

Overall, very solid food, but not mind blowing. For sure, everything is extremely fresh, In fact they ran out of a number of items at the end of the lunch rush, which I respect. A restaurant should make their items fresh everyday.  I am looking forward to returning and trying other items off their menu.",2016-01-30 02:39:18

Our server was very nice. A little too casual, but he was doing okay. He knew the menu and the options, so I can say he was on his game as far as server professionalism. 

I had the Surf & Turf, which was good, but not great. The side of asparagus was over cooked and tasted like something gourmet that you tried to cook at home, but didn't get quite right the first time.

Like, super tasty. Can't emphasize enough. But the last time I was there I had a really bad experience. My well-vodka soda tasted like it was poured in a poisoned glass. It was beyond gross. Undrinkable. I tried. My buddy had a well vodka cran. Same exact thing. Something was off. So after trying to choke it down I complained. I said, it's not a big deal. DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT, but... it's gross. There is something wrong with something. So the fucking manager comes out and tells me that well vodka doesn't taste good. Thanks, Asshole. I drink well vodka ALL THE TIME and it doesn't taste like a chemical cocktail. So then he tells me that it comes out of his pay. Dude, are you serious right now? I just wanted a new fucking drink. Didn't want to enter psycho therapy with you. I'll pay for the drink. So now I don't want to go there anymore even though the food is really really good. Amazing.

From the tire swings to the trailer, they made sure every aspect of the restaurant stuck to the theme.

There were about 30 of us and most of us just ordered appetizers. 

I ordered the mussels, and that was probably the best thing I had all night. The sauce was a little more on the spicy side, but that made it more flavorful to me than the other things they had on the menu. 

The spicy pork shanks were ok as well, nothing spectacular. 

The pork rinds were good, but I would have wanted them to be crispy. I liked that they came in a paper bag, but a lot of them were a stale, like it had been sitting out there for awhile. 

The dry chili fries was a little disappointing as well. I actually don't like my fries too crunchy, I even like it a little soft, but just like the pork rinds, it was a little stale to our taste. I did enjoy their ranch dressing though! 

The pretzels and cheese dip was good as well but you can't really mess that up.

I tried the smores drink and yes, I did it for the gram. Don't get me wrong though, it was definitely picture worthy but that's about it. It didn't taste as good as they described it, I barely drank half of it. Some of the drinks I enjoyed from my friends were the fig mule and the camp sangria! 

I still enjoyed my time here even though the food wasn't amazing. I think it's good for big groups. Even though there were about 30 of us, it didn't feel like we were too loud or overwhelming to other customers. Maybe I'll try to come back for happy hour, just for the tire swings, and the drinks.",2017-08-07 21:16:36

I ordered the shio pork ramen in a light soup with thick noodles and pork shoulder. Our family ended up ordering all the flavours they offer - shoyu, miso, & spicy jalapeno.  I loved my order - not too salty and the overall flavour was well-rounded. For my family members, some found the shoyu soup salty (it has soy sauce in it); the spicy jalapeno was good but caution - spicy lovers will find it just right...those that can't take spice well will definitely feel the heat. The miso was really yummy, no complaints. Also ordered the goyzu dumplings which were delish with their yimmy sauce.

Service was great - friendly and accommodating.  

I'd come here again or maybe check out the other locations. When you're here, ask about the Kinton Bowler rewards program - every time you finish a whole bowl, you get your card punched out and reach reward levels at 10 bowls, 30, 50, 100, 500, & even 1000.

d72smWtsfdswQFEwKCZoiw,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,QvC9BTeewBxMgdUadFglKw,3,9,8,10,"The Promenade Cafe is the cafe of the J.W. Marriott Resort at Summerlin / The Rampart Casino. It is the go to restaurant for casual dining in this Summerlin property.

  In the last couple of months when I was in the area I had dinner here. What strikes me about Promenade  Cafe is that it is inside an attractive casino resort that is surrounded by golf courses and upmarket homes, yet charges prices similar to a Boulder Highway casino. On both visits, I'd enjoy a taste of Boulder Highway in the heart of Summerlin. 

  The two meals that I enjoyed here have been the chicken fettuccine and spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccine is one of three $9.99 deals where you pick a soup or salad, a listed entrée, and choice of a listed dessert. Of course the beverage and tip accelerate the bill to around $15 which is worth it. The food was good. The strawberry cheesecake was puny. On this visit the tone of the service was Allright with the exception of a major restaurant etiquette no! no! When a guest is still working on the entrée, you never ever place the dessert on the table. Talk about being hurried. And why? I was one of the few guests in the restaurant. On Saturday, I stopped here after Dessert Shores where I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs that included soup or salad. It costed $7.99 comparable to an old school casino. Spaghetti with meatballs is also one of the few $9.99 dinners. The $2 difference is the puny dessert. The chicken noodle soup was in a bowl in lieu of a cup that is the standard in many resorts. I appreciated the larger portion. The spaghetti with meatballs was okay. To be honest this is fool proof course that is impossible to mess up. But it fell short of the spaghetti & meatballs that I am a fan of in the Railroad Pass Casino. Three meatballs accompanyed the spaghettis. It would of been nice if Promenade Cafe offered Grated to put on the spaghetti as most places do. Maybe this is why the spaghetti lacked flavor. 

  Spending some time here, I observed that the Starbuck's down the hall closes around 9 P.M. In the later hours of the evening this is the spot for coffee.

  In conclusion, Promenade Cafe is a decent restaurant  to enjoy an old school casino style dinner in the heart of Summerlin. Compared to the cafe in the Sun Coast  a traffic signal south on Rampart Boulevard, I prefer it over the Promenade Cafe. My final verdict: Promenade Cafe 3 Stars.",2015-07-16 07:23:53

I left feeling pretty disappointed. 

I don't like waitstaff who start out very nice and then snub you when you just order an appetizer and drinks. It was lunchtime, not prom night. Geezus. Our waiter's attitude changed instantly when we ordered a bruschetta, kids meal and drinks. He actually said, ""That's it?""  He never came back to check on our drinks or to clear dishes. He was in an ass-kissing conversation with the table across from us when he dropped off the check, it was an absolute after thought. 

The bruschetta sampler was delicious, and my daughter liked her kids lasagna, but I won't be coming back thanks to the service. I am not willing to risk putting our group of friends & family through crappy service for an expensive, special occasion dinner. 

I understand that society believes it acceptable to tip off the dollar amount of a meal. This is why waiters get annoyed when you don't spend the big bucks, I get it. I, however, tip off the quality of the service. I believe a customer who orders an ice tea deserves the same great service as a customer who orders a $500 meal.

The premise of the show is about a brother and sister in the ancient empire. That's pretty much all I could tell you because the story line was so difficult to follow. Read the background before hand it'll help a lot. 

The actual action that you expect from a cirque performance was really awesome! Although I felt like there wasn't enough of it, there were parts that moved way to slow when I wanted to see the action and stunts that cirque is known for.

Here's what I've ordered during my past two visits:

Appetizer: Artichoke 'Guac'
Dip was delicious and definitely loaded with artichokes. The pita chips are seasoned and went well with the dip, but it's just one of those appetizers that you grow tired of eating. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?userid=epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg#MvQoV9XiC9Kavdjkf83eag)

Burger: 'Big Fat Greek'
Tastes like you're eating a gyro, except in burger form. Delicious, but I think it's too salty. 

Burger: Korean 'Bull' Gogi
Burger is very yummy and mouthwatering. All the ingredients (beef, kimchee slaw, fried egg) complement each other. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?userid=epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg#aatTtDjdpUhV4FIwjmVzSw)

Milkshake: Drunken Monkey
Excuse me, but I have to use the 90's term BOMB. Because this was probably one of the best milkshakes I have ever had. It consists of Reese's, Banana, Malt, and Frangelico. I split this with a friend since I didn't think I could finish a milkshake after having eaten my burger and appetizer, but I'm positive I could've finished this without any help.

I like Holsteins -- really -- but it's definitely not a place that I'd hit up every time I have a burger craving.

The first time I was pregnant and I think that was effecting my taste buds and overAll opinion of this place. Two years ago I would have given it a one star. The smell of the place made me want to vomit and the food tasted horrendous. I think it was the smell of the grease that had the affect of me.

Now, though my uterus is unoccupied and feeling happy. So we came here a few days ago to give it another go. This time I could actually walk in and breathe. Yay!

Sweet tea is delicious and fresh, their lemonade is awesome. Freshly squeezed throughout the day and perfectly sweet and sour.

The customer service was fantastic. A manager came over to ask how we were doing and answered my husbands questions. 1. If they were going to build one closer to redrock.. The answer was no. And 2. If they were going to bring it to the strip or east coast.. The answer was also no. Boooooooo ;(

Wow, how things change as you get older.

The outside is nice, in a strangely tacky way with the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe and several other important Parisian landmarks I can't remember the names of all on top of each other. The inside is a claustrophobic mess. It was built in 1999 and yet if I didn't know any better I would probably think it's much older.

Anyways.
Things I've heard: Ray J likes to hang out here. Of all places on The Strip he chooses Paris.....don't ask me.
Interior and Decor: Very little space inside as already stated. Even on a non-busy traveling day and/or weekend it's still crowded. The fake sky on the ceiling sort of implies that the Eiffel Tower is higher than the stratosphere (the actual stratosphere, not the tower).....yeah. The fake trees and plants inside are quite hilarious. 
Food: The Le Village Buffet is one of the best in town. Everything else is very French save a burger place in the back.
Miscellaneous (or in other words I don't know what category to throw everything else in): The restrooms are awkward. If I have to drain the weasel when I'm in here (and I strangely seem to be in this place a lot) I actually will walk all the way to the bridge in the back and use it in Bally's. No barriers between the urinals, and the appearance of the stalls make me feel uncomfortable. They're just weird. Also, the shopping area is also very French, and not in the Chanel sense. Le Enfants probably is a store for babies and/or children, whatever the names of the other stores mean....your guess is as good as mine, unless you know French.

Amsterdam always seemed more appealing than Paris. Maybe I would like it better if it were an Amsterdam themed place? Oh well, at least you can get a crepe pretty much anywhere inside here.",2011-01-09 07:41:03

Flowers are nice, but a dessert from Bobbette and Belle is sumptuous!

My wife loves, loves, loves cupcakes, so I had to treat her to a Bobbette and Belle cupcake. You'll notice right away the selection isn't as extensive as some other bakeries but the quality is prominent.

I purchased the following cupcakes, salted caramel, a hazelnut and a chocolate cupcake.

The most noticeable element of these cupcakes was the buttercream icing. Creamy and lightly infused with the flavor of either caramel, hazelnut or chocolate,  the buttercream was a wonderful change from the typical mountain of frosted sugar you find with other bakeries.

Not that we don't like mountains of frosted sugar, but definitely a wonderful change from the mainstream.

I would definitely recommended the salted caramel for a first time experience!",2016-03-17 17:38:59

Burger Bar seemed to have a lot going for it - fun spaghetti western playing on the TV, retro drink menus that I remember from when I was a kid, promising menu, etc.  But alas, the great music and fun decor could not save this place from its bad service and mediocre food.

Our server was pleasant but didn't seem overly concerned with actually helping us.  She told us everything they were out of (onion rings, some of the beers, the organic burgers) and then claimed that the organic meat and the non-organic meat most likely came from the same cow.  ""It doesn't mean anything,"" she said cheerily.  

The spinach salad was pleasantly acidic but way over-salted.  Our burgers came and almost every order was wrong.  I had ordered lamb with tzatziki sauce but received a regular burger with mustard.  My tzatziki ended up on my husband's veggie burger (which tasted like a dry, not-fully-cooked falafel patty), my friend's side salad never came.  My hamburger bun was tasty, but my friends' all agreed that they would have tasted better toasted.  

Our server put the bill on the table at the end of the meal but then never came to collect.  All in all, while we enjoyed the eclectic Blur, Michael Jackson and Fleetwood Mac soundtrack, we won't be coming back.  There are far tastier (and cheaper) burgers in the city.

We tried many of the salads and small plates and they were all good (I guess they worked their kinks out) Here is what we had: 

onion and tomato tart - very good, the onions were nicely caramelized, so their flavor was not overly strong... yum!

Cornbread salad- every element on this dish was delicious, the okra was perfect, the sauce was good, the beets were even good (and I do no like beets)

The brioche rolls - these things could be addicting, they are served with some wonderful apple butter and when eaten together, they are a good balance of sweet and salty. 

Dirty rice croquettes- these were my overall favorite... they were bursting with flavor and extremely filling. They were spicy with a nice fresh element from the greens served with it and the pea shoots. Overall, a real winner. 

Watermelon salad - very light and fresh, yummy

Gumbo- nice flavor, a little less spicy than I would typically like, but overall a solid dish. The small plate is a small cup, but it's hearty. 

The broccoli and cauliflower casserole - this was ok, but parts of it were ice cold.... not great. 

These small plates were more than enough for the 3 of us, we were stuffed and didn't even finish all of the food. 

We also had a couple of cocktails. The Austin mule was delicious... perfectly gingery and citrusy.

The eggroll was accompanied by some type of fruit sauce (pineapple maybe), that was also, just ok.   The entree, where do I start?

While I don't think it is the highest restaurant in the world anymore (that's in Dubai), it's certainly the tallest view of this city. The entire outer edge of the restaurant completes a full revolution in a brisk 72 minutes (and why people are determined to test this is beyond me). This gives you a wide vista of the lake, Toronto Island, and the downtown core.

As a non-tourist to Toronto -- and therefore not effervescently soaking in every wonderous facet of the tower -- I found getting here a little annoying. There is a green-screen photobooth on ground level (which we sprinted past) and then a wait at the elevators, and then yet another wait to get into the restaurant; odd considering it's reservations only. It was a relief once we were seated. 

The 360 has the atmosphere of an upscale chain steakhouse. Note that there are some tables NOT situated directly next to windows, and I would feel hosed were I seated there. (Mostly two-tops.) Probably worth clarifying this specifically when making a reservation.

Much has been said about the high-prices here, so I will only chime to agree that yes, the menu is pretty overpriced for what you get. You'll probably end up ordering either the $55 or $68 prix fixe meals, as scanning a la carte pricing might give you vertigo (shrimp and grits: $50?). I opted for the bigger prix fixe.

We started off well. The charcuterie board was served with Kozlik's mustard and had some nice Quebec cheeses. And there was a dill gazpacho served in a shot glass as an amuse bouche. Ooh la la. My entrée (which took a while) was a prime rib with bread pudding. The prime rib was cooked OK, but it wasn't stellar. I can't put my finger on it, but it just wasn't melt-in-your-mouth succulent. The bread pudding is easier to assess: burnt and bitter. It was truly terrible, and I wish I hadn't even taken a bite.

My goat's milk vanilla ice cream for dessert was topped with dulce de leche and caramelized bananas. Not a bad way to end off a meal. By the time we left, the sun had set and downtown had transformed into twinkling lights against the darkness. (Our 7:30pm reservation let us catch the skyline in daylight, and let us enjoy the sunset too.) The atmosphere is definitely enjoyable, but food-wise you're likely to be disappointed.

Obligatory Title Pun: Unsuited for TOWERING expectations.

Menu Readability: Well-designed to make you order the prix-fixe.

Need to mention: No patio. Unless you want to die.

The pro:  
 - Service is good.  Attentive, prompt, friendly and very competent.  Even on a VERY crowded Saturday night when the place was absolutely packed. 

The con:
 - Bland and poorly done food.  The soup was tasteless.  The bison rib-eye was all gristle.  Wilted lettuce on the salad and if there was ANY dressing on it, I couldn't taste it.  The fries were typical dive-bar fare.  The only exception were the two pizzas at our table.  Both were very good.  

So I guess if you're looking for great beer and tasty pizza, this is your place.  If you want good food, done well, head somewhere else.

HINT:  We had a reservation but were told that we'd have to wait about 30 minutes ""until our table was ready.""  We saw a bunch of empty tables in the bar area and asked if we could wait there and have a drink (or three).  When the server arrived, she said that we could order from the full menu in the ""bar.""

My friend's lemon square was unbelievably sour that she couldn't even finish half of it but at least the crust was nice. Maybe I should have just stuck with their signature desserts instead.

I guess considering its a store front compared to some companies that deal online or through supplying boutiques/natural grocers it's a bit understandable. I go for more flavored type teas here and buy some of the finer varieties elsewhere as the quality has also been better on those for the price (IE jasmine pearls which I love). I still like that Teavana introduces a lot of people to loose leaf tea as it's accessible to most and has variety.

The thing that changed my mind about this place is the attitude of the customer service. It's friggin tea being sold at a skeevy used car sales upsell and high pressure. They make commission but that shouldn't make service suffer to try to get more sales. I've been in sales jobs with quotas and making a person feel they are being squeezed isn't the way to go. 

I want two ounces of this tea. ""Is 3.8 ounces okay?"" NO. That's double what I asked for. If I like it, I'll come back. I just want a small quantity of new teas. 

Even if I'm buying a few items and said there is nothing else, they still are relentless. Do you need a tea maker? What about mugs? A travel cup? Sugar? Honey sticks? Tea bags? Would you buy my soul? 

This isn't a isolated incident. It's happened a few times I've been in and my visits get less because of it. My fiance has complained about this the past few times he's been to this location and other locations. 

I drink tea daily so I could be a really good customer if I was just treated as not dollar signs and sales quota. I think I can live without setting foot in Teavana from now on.

Because in spite of your oddities, and your hit-or-miss inventory, and your hit-or-miss employees, you are truly magnificent.

Whatever you want, they're probably got it. My one issue with the inventory is that I frequently shop here for gifts, and it's not uncommon for Zia to have literally dozens of gift list items only as used copies. Some people don't mind receiving good used stuff, but when I need or want to buy new, it's kind of a bummer.

And now, a secret, since several people have mentioned bearing the local record shop's higher prices: Zia usually discounts for preorder and release. If you know there's an album coming out that you want, either preorder it or go buy it the week it comes out. You'll save 3 or 4 bucks over going in the next week.

We go here for the AYCE yes the all you can eat sushi. They have good rolls and a nice generous selection of options.

I tend to order half rolls so I can try many, that is not a problem. 

You go here for the food, to eat and get your fill of sushi. Not for the service, the guys behind the bar making your rolls are attentive however not friendly and they never smile or talk to you other than the ""thank you"" as you are almost out of the door.

We ordered: 

Billionaire Burger - Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo 
----For $30 ($2 for added mushrooms) this burger was just okay.  Foie gras was kind of small, burger was cooked medium-well instead of well.   Came with side of fries.  

I prefer the Rossini at Burger Bar.  At double the price it's kind of high, but the taste is 5 times better.  

'THE RISING SUN'  - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado

$17 - Tempura avocado was huge, bigger than the burger and it looked awkward and hard to eat.  Bun seems hard to balance on top of it.  Otherwise it was not a bad burger as well. 

TRUFFLE LOBSTER 'MAC N CHEESE'  - Creamy Tallegio-Mascarpone Sauce With Maine Lobster And Black Truffle

$16.50 - Enjoyed this the most but Lobster Me does this better.   The single potato chip w/ lobster that comes with the mac and cheese plate was a great addition to this.  Should be it's own appetizer.

Mind you, the food was not bad.  However, we looked at the menu online and there were many things we wanted to try.  However, when we got there, they said their menu is cut in about half during the summer (wish they would have said this on their website).  the two appetizers we wanted to try - yellowfin tuna lettuce wraps and smoked salmon - were unavailable.  In addtion, the pistachio encrusted salmon was unavailable durign the summer.

We ordered some salads...i had iceberg wedge which was fine, but honestly, better (any way bigger) at any steakhouse.  For entree I had a fish called barramundi.  It tasted fine (but nothong special), and it cost 27$ and came with nothing of subtstance except for some avodacdo on top.  Even worse, there is not even an option to order any sides! 

Another person in my reservation had the filet mignon (36$).  It looked pathetic.  He ordered it med rare and it came med well.  I woulda sent it back but he is too nice.  Also so small, maybe 6 oz at best.  He said it was dry and lacked flavor as well (what do you expect when you serve a super thin filet mignon med well).

Lastly, we ordered 2 entrees to share, and they brought it out on seperate plates which is nice.  But, without mentioning anything when we told the waiter that we wanted to share the entrees, they added $5 to each entree we split!  Our bill for 5 people was over 200$ (4 of us and 1 child) and we ordered a bottle of wine, and they are nickel and diming us for 5 freakin dollars?  What a joke.  We complained, and they took the 10$ off the bill for the 2 shared entrees, and decided to add gratuity onto the bill instead, which was fine since the service was pretty good (except for failing to tell us taht it cost money to share a meal, when we would have been perfectly fine just asking for an extra plate).

Also had 2 desserts, 10$ each, which were OK but nothing special.

The place is very small, but nice and cozy (maybe about the size of Mi Cocina Mi Pais). We went after traditional lunch-rush hours, so it was not too cramped. I'm actually glad they opted for a small location. Several of our favorite places have gone out of business lately due to too much overhead, so it's good they are keeping their expenses low. We had our toddler with us, so we opted for the outdoor seating and all was well.

We tried a variety of Filipino dishes and everything was great. I had the chicken adobo and kaldereta--both were excellent, as was the garlic rice I had on the side. My wife and niece, who are both Filipinas, also were impressed with the food--especially the cassava cake, which they raved about. Karey's also offers Mexican-Filipino fusion dishes which we did not try this time, but I might go for an adobo burrito or something next time and update the review. The service was also outstanding--super-friendly and fast. My wife ended up having a very nice long conversation with the owners after our lunch. 

Living in a Fil-Am household we are always looking for new places to stock up on Filipino food. My wife is a restaurant manager (Panda Express), so the last thing she wants to do at home is cook--and as for me, well if it does not involve fire or barbeque sauce its better that we not go there. So, we order take-out food frequently. Along with Wholly Grill, we now have two new staples. I can tell right now I will be stopping here on my way home from work A LOT!

I'm giving Karey's five stars based on the fact that the food was good, the service was fast, and the owners were super-friendly. That goes a long way in my book.",2009-10-13 19:54:10

I explained that I wanted ""mostly foam"" in the drink and she proceeded to start the drink.

Once milk reaches a certain temperature it spoils & scalds, but I also don't think that was taught. She repeated this 5-8 times until she got foam, often refilling the pitcher. It took about 10 minutes to get my (small sized) Capp. I definitely give her two stars for effort- the ignorance is not her fault.

My husband and I judge whether we will re-visit a Japanese restaurant by the quality of its sashimi. Sashimi is usually the first thing we order in a Japanese restaurant, and sadly, it also often ends up being the last thing we had in most Japanese restaurants. Although sometimes we have to put up with skimpy pieces, rough uneven cuts, and fishy aftertaste, the husband and I are in our unwavering quest for the sashimi we want to come back for.

Then we found Sushi Ken, with its beautiful, thick-cut sashimi, thawed to a soft, buttery texture, and no fishy taste. Plus, reasonable price too. 

Because I have a soft spot for ramen noodles, I also ordered the combo of Tonkatsu noodle and beef curry for $11. The ramen is okey, probably not good enough for people from NYC or CA who are pampered by good Japanese restaurants. To me, it is satisfying because it is comfort food. I am forgiving as long as I can have one when I need one. 

The beef curry is quite generous in portion given it's like 3 bucks extra in addition to the ramen if you get them in combo. Again, it is not outstanding, but good enough for me.

I think service was great during the time we were there. Most servers were Japanese and were very friendly. The menu has a large selection of food. To us, they did one thing, and the most important thing right--sashimi. We will be back, soon.",2012-10-08 18:20:01

In the dying breed of ala carte sushi restaurants standing up against the evil that is all you can eat (mostly chinese run) sushi restaurants in all cities, this is one of the few gems left. 

Don't get me wrong, I still like ayce and buffets because lets face it I like getting my bang for my buck. But I won't agree that the quality is the same and sometimes I just want a good top quality piece of fish in my dinner instead of slivers of slightly less than fresh fish. 

The vegetarian bento box my friend got smelled and tasted delicious. She especially appreciated the fact that you can choose the items to include in your bento which at other places she remarked always costs her a few bucks extra.

They also did the bibim sauce on the side which is rare in chain run or other korean restaurants in sauga. 

They have discounts on their daily rolls of the day specials! Also a plus is that their salad is never limp and lifeless but fresh and had a delicious dressing on top.

We ordered the Tree Top, the Brown Velvet and the infamous Orange Blossom (winner of Food Network's Cupcake Wars).
The Tree Top's frosting was amazing, it was a chocolate cupcake topped with chocolate buttercream, pecans, coconuts, and caramel. The frosting seriously tasted like Samoa Girl Scout cookies, which are my fave!
The Brown Velvet tasted like a standard Red Velvet cupcake and one Earth Day cupcake resembled it uncannily. The only difference is the Earth Day cupcake has a tiny Earth chocolate ball on top for a garnish, otherwise it is the exact same cupcake, (reconfirmed by the staff) which was a little disappointing both for the ED theme but also as there was nothing notable about it.
Finally the infamous Orange Blossom cupcake was airy with a touch of orange zest crunch in the frosting. The flavors were subtle and I wasn't a huge fan of this one, fame or not, simply because the cake seemed too bland compared to the frosting.
Overall, cupcake-wise I believe Urban Cookies focuses their creativity and attention on frosting, but should amp up their cakes.

After his Iron Chef fame where he defeated Bobby Flay with his Lobster Poutine, demand has been through the roof.  Rumours are that his restaurant, Garde Manger was booked out by 3 months!  In hopes of offering more of his yummy food to eager diners and without wanting to disappoint and turn away his customers - Le Bremner was born.

The ambiance is not too different from Garde Manger with its dim lighting and wood-accented furniture.  However, I was able to nab a reservation a week ahead which was a blessing. The servers here are all very knowledgeable about the menu and can make some great recommendations.  I must urge you to try one of their yummy cocktails with housemade syrups.  I opted for the Posemary - which was made with gin, sake, lime syrup, rosemary and grilled pears.  I was deeply and utterly satisfied.  I dare say this was the best cocktail I had ever sampled in my life!

Bread sticks were offered to us, and I felt like picking one up and conducting a symphony when I saw how long they were.  They were buttery and salted.  To start we got oysters on the half shell which hailed from New Brunswick  (Chiasson and Village Bay) oysters tonight. It was accompanied by a supporting cast of regular and cucumber mignonette with fresh horseradish, lemon and Sriracha.  These were one of the freshest oysters I've had in a long time.  We devoured these quickly.

Our second starter was the Lobster Toast au Gratin, which is essentially a Croque Madame with lobster meat in it.  This would be the one dish that stands out in my mind when I recall all the wonderful culinary delights I sampled in Montréal.  The béchamel sauce, the chunks of lobster meat, the buttery toast and the perfectly poached egg was like an epiphany in my mouth.  It was oh so creamy and oh so delicious!  I am dreaming of it right now... If there were only one thing I could change about this dish - it would've been the bread as I found it broke the delicateness of the overall dish.  The bread was a very sturdy bread.  I would've preferred something a little thinner.

For mains I ordered the Halibut which was served with Crispy Pork Rinds and Chantarelles on a bed of Mash.  Le Bremner - how could you, Titan  and ruler of all things seafood, manage to burn my halibut?  It was as shocking and disappointing as learning that Santa was really just some chump in a suit.  So close to being a perfect evening!  I expected the crunchy (from the pork rinds), but not from the sound of biting into an unpleasantly burnt skin.  The flavours, however, were perfect!

I also sampled the Cheese Steak which was topped with arugula and the thinnest fried onions imaginable.  The steak was tender, but I thought there wasn't anything special about it.  I wonder...If I hadn't tasted the wonder that was the Lobster Toast if I would've praised it more?

For dessert we had the Pear Tatin. Anything with the word tatin in it usually means longer prep time, so if you are opting for this, you may want to time it better so that you're not left nursing a glass of water and twiddling your thumbs when dinner is over.

The espresso at Le Bremner was so powerful I was almost thrust out of my chair.  Alas, once the dessert came, it evened out the imbalance of boldness and sweetness :)

The tart tatin came out piping hot, and was topped with ice cream.  A la mode boys and gals is the only way a pie should be eaten!

Verdict:

Being the restaurant that served me up my most memorable dish, I can't say that Le Bremner wasn't good, but is it one of the top 10 places I'd recommend?  I must say no.  The irony that I found out Chuck Hughes lost to Beau McMillan on the Iron Chef: Super Chefs only 2 days prior to my departure was an omen? Some would argue that in his defense, tofu, the secret ingredient of the battle was not Chuck's forte.  My argument - if you are a celebrity chef, I expect you to know how to cook with any ingredient that is presented to you.

Although my most memorable Lobster Toast was consumed here, the tragedy that was the burnt halibut will also remain in my memory.  The Lobster Toast is to Chuck's first win on Iron Chef as the Halibut is to his recent loss on Iron Chef :p",2011-11-30 13:55:15

Apparently, while I was away for college, a location sprouted up in Vegas as I enjoyed the shrimp from its SoCal counterparts. Right, duh, I knew that.

Fast forward about eight months later, we finally put on our bibs and started peeling shrimp. Got my usual order of one pound of shrimp with the whole shabang of seasonings and XXX for the heat. Perhaps my tolerance for heat and spices went up, but the XXX seemed really tame! I also love eating the chunks of cooked garlic in between preparing my next seafood sacrifice. Their Cajun fries are seasoned well like their marine friends, and their sweet potato fries also make great accompaniments.

Considering it was a late afternoon lunch and didn't seem that busy, I thought the service was lacking a bit. It took a while to flag down the waiter for water then the bill. I've had more attentive service at busier Boiling Crabs that were practically overflowing with people.

So why has it taken me so long to finally try this one, despite it being located a mere stone's throw from our house? Good question. Maybe I found the name itself, Sugar Donuts, redundant. Does it mean that they have extra sugar and do I really need to be reminded of that? Hey I already know they're bad for me! Regardless, my fellow Yelpers had too many great things to say for me to stay away forever...

So, at a weak moment on a Friday morning, I popped in and picked a pair. First of all, they are huge and run $28 for dozen and $15 for a half dozen, which is about twice as expensive as the big chains, but appropriate based on quality and quantity. Out of a dozen or so different choices, I chose everyone's favorite these days, the trendy maple bacon donut, and the standard plain frosted which they call Vanilla Bean.

I enjoyed both as each had its own charm; however, as a bacon donut fan, theirs is my least favorite of the five or so I've had elsewhere (such as Duck and Rise). About the size and shape of half a softball, it is more like a big honey bun that a donut, which for me, meant too much bread and the bacon itself was just too fatty and sat precariously atop in what looked like globs. 

In fairness, I need mention that none of this offended me so badly that I didn't polish of the entire thing (including the crumbs) and I have every intention of returning for more research. Oh yeah, it's definitely a Gotta Try!",2018-02-11 03:45:41

I have to say for the $2.95 price tag on their selections of hour hour menu, the food was delicious and the portions were fair.

My favorites on their new Spring 2011 Happy Hour menu are the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (the Black Pepper Sauce is great with pretty much anything savory, try it withthe BRIO Burger or the shrimp from the Shrimptini), followed closely by the Marghita Flatbread.  I would also recommend The Beef Carpaccio, BRIO Burger,and as far as their Strawberry Lemonade (non-alcoholic).

If you are not working during the weekday afternoon,and happens to be at Town Square shopping or watching a movie or whatever, drop by for inexpensive and very good food.  But plan on arriving around 3:30pm,as the HH is only valid at the bar area, which fillsup rather quickly.

Thanks again to Suki L for organizing the UYE here, so I try their HH. And like Anthony M, I think this is also one of my favorite HH in Vegas.

Decor: 5/5 It reminded me of the decor at The Cheese Cake Factory, but with their own twist.  Ilike it.

Ambiance: 4/5  It has good atmosphere.

Service: 5/5  The bartenders, waiters,bussers were all great.  Even when it is busy, they paid attention to the customers making sure our orders are placed and our drinks are refilled.

Food:  4/5  Based on the HH menu only.  I liked most of the food I ordered, while some I am glad I tried but would likely not order again now that I know which ones I really like.

Price:  5/5 for HH
            3/5 for non-HH.

Obviously you can never compare to the quality back home but it's really not that bad! The skin is charred perfectly! Other items on the menu are pretty delicious and well made as well. 

Service - well it's a typical Chinese place, what service are we talking about? Just doesn't make any sense to me though because the place is considered fancy with the decor and everything.

My husband and I after a long wait, finally made our way to visit San Remo. We live around the area and despite the cold sunday - it was just the right day! We had some friends coming over and I didn't have time to make dessert. 

I'm not sure if its the fact that we went their on an empty stomach, but everything was just delectable. To eat there for breakfast we had: Blueberry Danish, Carrot Cake and two cappucinos. TO GO we got two nutella donuts, a gardoni and a pistachio cannoli. My overall review was that the pastries were very good just as most italian pastries are. My only complaint was the coffee. Unfortunately because it was so busy, I think the person who made our coffee rushed it a bit, so my cappucino was a luke warm to cold.

So my husband being a darling replied, we'll go there after we pick up some plants as a reward to me for being a good husband. Yup, I got me one of the good ones.

So after much time mulling over what plants to get, we headed over to Torpedo Comics. To me, it seems like it is out of place as the location seems rather industrial.

First, the outside is very appealing as they have some characters painted on the outside of the store.  As you walk in, it is very nicely organized and clean. And best of all, no empty war of wizard tables in the middle of the store keeping you from getting to the good stuff.

Over to the right, is a glassed off section with a Yoda statue in it. To me, it resembles the Yoda fountain they have at the Lucas Film studio in the Presidio. The room also had boxes of comics in there but you can't get to it because the glass doors are locked. Smart idea because if it were open, my husband would have been all over Yoda.

As you walk in the store, they do have a large glass case, in the shape of a rectangle, with all the hard to find pieces in there. They had a few old copies of the Annie book series and even had a Luke Skywalker speedster with ObiWan that was sold in the 90s. At least there was one since I bought it for my husband. I though the item was reasonably priced at $25, but the owner was kind enough to discount it and we were able to get it for $20 along with a funko that I wish I could remember what it was, but also reasonably priced at $8.

On the same glass counter, nearer the door, were stack of t-shirts that they were selling for only $10. Most of them were of Harlequin ranging from S to L. They did have a Boba Fett polyester type hoodie that was $25. Thank goodness they didn't have my husband's size.

Ever watch Comic Book Men? If you do, they even have their own ""Bryan"" that doesn't work there but is there all the time working...go figure!

We did learn from the owner that they will be moving to a new location somewhere on Rainbow. You'll have to follow them on Facebook to find out when and where they will be moving to.

While at the Fashion Show mall, my boyfriend and I were coming down the escalator when he spotted the display of ice creams here. It looked enticing so we decided to check it out. We each sampled a flavor. I tried the birthday cake, and it literally had no taste whatsoever. I don't know how that's possible for birthday cake, but it honestly tasted like absolutely nothing. He tried one of the peanut butter flavors, and obviously didn't like it because he decided not to get anything here and went and got a pretzel next door instead. I felt bad not getting anything though, so I ordered coconut sorbet in a waffle cone. The whole ordering process was awkward, because I ordered it and was waiting for the girl to give it to me, but she walked away to the other side of the counter and didn't come back. I finally went over there, and apparently she was standing at the register waiting for me to pay. I thought that was strange because normally you get the ice cream first and pay at the end, but whatever. So I paid, and as soon as I did a group of people came up to the register. Rather than get my ice cream so I could leave since I had already payed and then take the next customers, the girl answered several questions for the group and then took their order and rang them up. The whole time I was standing by the ice cream counter patiently waiting for what I had bought, which I honestly didn't even want in the first place, I only ordered it since she had let us sample first and I felt bad. I seriously considered telling her to just cancel my order while I was waiting, but I definitely didn't want to make a scene. Another employee eventually came out and got my order for me, while the first girl was still with the other customers. The coconut sorbet was definitely better than the birthday cake ice cream, but it still wasn't great. Not much flavor and the texture was hard.

Yesterday, National Vanilla Ice Cream Day led me to this very Golden Arches. 

  The McDonald's cone of soft vanilla ice cream is a treat that brings me back to when I was a little kid in the late 1970s when my grandfather treated me to this ice cream in the Whitestone Expressway McDonald's  (Flushing, New York City). Somewhere along the way I grew tired of vanilla ice cream. This cone of soft vanilla ice cream that I celebrated on National Vanilla Ice Cream Day was the first in at twenty years. You know what? This soft vanilla ice cream in a cake cone tasted delicious and changed my negative opinion of vanilla ice cream onto a positive one. It is only $1.08 after tax and one of McDonald's best kept secrets. 

  It was more than vanilla ice cream that led me here. I had been hiking for hours up in Mount Charleston and was going to meet up with my brother. I was in the mood for quick, convenient, and inexpensive fast food. After hours of hiking in Mount Charleston my tired brain was in a state where McDonald's was as good as Bachi Burger. Before participating in National Vanilla Ice Cream Day, I ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese meal that came out to around $6.40. After hours of hiking in the mountains, it really hit the spot. 

  As far as McDonald's this is a modern location. They have the computerized menu and the screen showing the orders that are ready. There is also a mini lounge with two plush chairs. 

 There were some opportunities in cleanliness and service. There was one very young woman that was taking orders. From my observation she seemed to be brand new which caused her to have to call the shift manager about a credit card and a customer mentioning that he waited twenty minutes for his cookies. When I left, what seemed to be an off the clock McDonald's employee was joking with an employee that he is not supposed to use that language in front of customers. As far as cleanliness, the trash buckets at the Coke machines were also overflowing. In reality this is the quintessential McDonald's. 

  In my opinion McDonald's is solid but not great fast food.

I REALLY wanted to eat here, but to no avail. When I called back and asked to place an order they asked to place me on hold again. Forget it, this place is too busy for their own good. No sandwich is worth that!

Environment:
So the restaurant is located at a plaza that's opposite of First Markham Place. I made the mistake of skimming through Google Map and drove right into FMP until I realized my mistake. The plaza Ten Ren is in is not the most recognizable, and the entrance is actually at a side road, even though it borders HWY 7.
The interior of the restaurant is nicely renovated, but the tables are a little too disburse in my opinion, which makes the place seem cold. There is a Ten Ren retail tea shop sharing the same space.

Food:
I noticed that the prices here are on the more expensive side for casual Taiwanese style restaurant. The bubble teas can cost around $6-7. They have combo deals for lunch and dinner, but I find those to be a little pricy as well. The items do get below $10 once you flip to the end of the menu, however.
I ordered the waffle and the Wuxi ribs with noodles. The waffles were pretty good. I like the presentation, good for photos. I do which they have syrup for the waffles. The Wuxi ribs weren't authentic. They were still nice and tender, but it doesn't have the authentic sweet and sour taste.

Service:
The restaurant was under staffed when I was there. It was difficult to find the server sometimes. They don't always speak Mandarin and/or Cantonese either.

I probably won't be making another visit. The food didn't wow me too much and I think it's a little over priced.",2016-04-23 01:30:22

I had driven by Yum Cha several times since it is close to my house, but I finally found someone to go try it with (dim sum is hard to eat alone). The restaurant itself is fairly large, and the birdcages hanging from the ceiling are very distinct. The interior was clean, and service was actually friendlier and more attentive than usual for a dim sum place. It was also not too crowded, but also not empty, so a nice balance and no wait before getting seated.

As for the dim sum itself, there is a hybrid system of a few carts that come around and food over at the counter. I haven't really seen this setup before, but anything you order up at the counter will be brought to your table. The food itself was not bad; not the best dim sum I've ever had, but I also haven't had any other dim sum in Las Vegas to compare with Yum Cha. 

Prices seemed reasonable; I didn't really pay attention to how much each dish cost, but we were pretty full at the end and the subtotal was about $20 per person for our party of two.

I read about him about a year ago, so when I learned that Dom DeMarco's was coming to Vegas, I was hot to try it.  What galvanized our visit to the restaurant last night was an impromptu firepit lawn party in my development:  one of our neighbors knows the owners, and had a couple of pies - round and square - for us to eat.  I got there late, natch, so all I was left with was a very cold Sicilian slice.  And I was blown away.

We were impressed with the restaurant's decor - modern, upscale, but the seating was uncomfortable for me.  Nice-looking fake leather webbed chairs and the upholstered booths had me sitting way too low for short little me, so I felt like a dog lapping out of a bowl.  (I did try one of the few straight-backed chairs before I left, just for comparison purposes, and they were fine; if we go back, I'll insist on that).  The patio, with its big, glass-covered patio, looked awesome, but it was too cold for it to be up and running.

Our waiter, Roberto, was completely unfriendly.  It's amazing how a friendly waiter can have an impact on my overall impression of a restaurant, and his demeanor definitely detracted.  In fact, I started a conversation in Spanish with a very friendly busboy, whose hometown in Mexico was my old home-away-from-home, and after a couple of minutes Roberto gave the busboy a curt and nasty signal that implied he needed to get his ass moving.  This kind of thing makes us feel like commodities, instead of valued customers.

Now for the food:  I've never been a fan of Sicilian (square) pizza but, because of the previous experience, we ordered half a square Bella Napoli, with tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and EVOO.  I have to say I didn't enjoy it as much as the cold one from the other night, which may have had sausage (it was too dark to see what was on it).  This pizza was grease personified, and with the tomatoes dripping all over the place, it needed to be eaten with a knife and fork which, to a Native New Yorker, is a complete sacrilege.  And $17 for half a Sicilian pie is pricey.  (Note to management:  sharper knives are needed!).  Still, it was good, but needed a bit of red pepper to liven up the flavor.

The little touches are nice - the water bottles that sit on the table, the heavy plates made in France, the modern pizza tower (though it didn't work for me in my sunken-down seat).  

If it weren't for the ambience, I'd be giving this three stars.  But since my credo is ""You CAN eat the atmosphere,"" I've bumped it to four.",2012-02-29 23:56:51

We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap ""free range"" chicken breast that was grilled.

We were seated really quick, which was good. Service wise I have no idea until this day who our server really was. No one really came over to take our drink orders, we came back with just two glasses of water at our table. Other than that, it was just different servers coming by to grab our plates. 

I honestly dont think Spoonful had that much selection compared to Mandarin either... considering that half their restaurant is dedicated to desserts. I ended up just eating the exact same thing on all three of my trips because there weren't that many options that stood out to me. 

I was excited for their ribs but it was just fat when I started cutting into it. Even got the ribs again during my second run but still ran into the same problem. Crab legs were so soft the tool they provided to help us crack it was pretty useless.

I couldn't wait to try the dessert - but again I was left disappointed. The only desserts I enjoyed were the green tea ice cream and fruits. Most of the desserts there seemed like they were purchased from the grocery store lol

Fried chicken: it did not have a lot of chicken but it was delicious. I would recommend to squeeze the lemon on top of the chicken if you like that.  

Yakoyati: comes out hot on a skillet. Wait a little bit before you start eating because it is extremely hot. They are crispy and you can taste and see the octopus inside it. The sauce compliments the yakoyati really well. They are also a good size as well. 

Miso carbonara: this is their most popular dish. It is a little bit more expensive. This is my favorite overall and it is what keeps me coming back. The broth or sauce is creamy without being oily.

I grabbed a special combo meat bahn mi #11. It was decent, but I've had better and it needed more filling/sauce/pickles/everything than it did. BF got a ham, turkey, cheese croissant. Decent, but not something out of the ordinary. The one thing that made the sandwiches less enjoyable is the haphazard way of throwing the ingredients in. Really, with no crazy rush of people waiting for food and a dozen employees around no one can be bothered to evenly spread out the toppings? 

I got a avocado shake and the BF got taro shake. Again, standard. Now the drinks made the guy at the register really confused. The BF was debating on a taro drink, but asked if they can do it just on ice instead of smoothie. The guy told him to ""get a Italian soda. I like passionfruit"".  So the BF then says, ""I'd like a regular Sierra Mist"" so he can get something simple that won't confused the guy. The guy looked so confused and looked at the board behind him for minutes and goes ""coke??soda"". ""Yes, that is a type of soda up there"". He didn't know how to ring it up and just rang up some tea that wasn't even the same price. The BF just told him to cancel it and ring up the damn taro smoothie if that was easier. Seriously, you don't know what Sierra Mist is? 

Another ding is that all the tables were dirty. All the booths were dirty so we went to find the least dirty table. At mightnight you seriously couldn't find time to wipe tables with 10 fucking staff members and maybe 2 tables occupied??!!

After a long but somewhat understandable summer line up, we ordered  Royal no. 9 and an oreo devil slush. 

The royal no.  9 was not cold enough as they didn't take enough time to shake the drink and it was very watered down.   There was hardly any tea flavor and none of that special blueberry notes compared to our first try.   I think the newer staff along with the long line up contributed to a less tasty experience. 

The Oreo devil slush tasted of chocolate powder and ice, no cream.   It was layered oddly with Oreo crumbs in the middle and the top which made for a lumpy consistency.  

We didn't know which drink tasted worse, but it was a close tie.   

Due to the inconsistent bubble teas we received from our first (and less busy) visit, we will not be back for more expensive and less tasty bubble tea.   Hopefully they'll find a way to be more consistent with their drinks.

I was sold the moment I saw the fried green tomato BLT online prior to visiting. My initial plan was just to stop in for a few pieces of chicken and some fried green tomatoes but ended up ordering a mini feast for myself. Going through the menu I saw cheddar waffles...CHEDDAR WAFFLES!!! with spiced watermelon and chicken. I'm use to the traditional chicken and waffles so I had to give these waffles a try and I was blown away. DELICIOUS!!! Adding maple syrup to the waffles didn't take away from the cheddar flavor mixing quite well. I glanced at another table and saw the mac and cheese so of course I wasn't leaving without ordering some also.

Funny story for kicks. I came to Yardbird after drinking on the strip with a friend and ended up going into the restaurant next to Yardbird thinking it was Yardbird before realizing it wasn't. Ordered drinks and everything only to have to leave and go next door. This actually gave a couple of staff members who were very nice by the way at Yardbird a good laugh when telling the story.

Chilly outside temps meant our table by the door was rather unfortunate with so many people coming & going & holding the door open for extended lengths of time. Brrrr!

Now, I should point out that this place is known for their sushi. I don't each fish - raw or otherwise, so I can't speak to what they're known for; other than to say my friends all raved about the Tiger Roll & Christmas Roll. I did, however, order the Daily Vegetable Special and the Vegetable Tempura rolls. This was my first time trying anything remotely sushi-related and my first time eating with chopsticks (they don't readily provide forks!! Well, they might if you NEED one and ask for it.) Our food was served in a very elaborate wooded boat, which was fun. The servers were very quick with our drink orders & refills.

I thought the food was flavorful & fresh. I'd skip the fried bananas & bananas sushi for dessert, but others seemed to enjoy the green tea ice cream for something unusual.

It's also fast moving because the staff knows you want to get outside and see those rocks!

The outdoor path to the basalt rock mound is wide and clear, though a little scary with all it's ""rattlesnake habitat"" signs. I'm not gonna lie: the petroglyphs are awesome. There are about 1500 images scattered across the rocky hill, and it seems like they are all facing the same side. It appears that the hill and the the rocks were very important to the people who carved these images and many present day tribes claim symbolism that pertains to their culture is found on the rocks, so maybe it was important for more than one group. My guess is the location was important because it was related to some ancient volcanic activity; that is how basalt is formed.

When the smoothie arrived, it tasted fantastic! It was so good but a little too sweet for me. 

This cafe is okay but I didn't think it was anything too special. My advice to the restaurant would be, when people come in groups, not everyone wants dessert. Perhaps it might be wise to add some snackable items onto your menu like edamame and other things that aren't infused with sugar.

Rightfully so it looked like an army had gone through.  We grabbed some cheese, fresh seafood and went to our table.  

We talk to Ira the manager and explained that we understood we were late but we would still like to have food that was hot and fresh.  He and our fabulous server Evan then set out to create a mini buffet for us at the table next to us.

We had:

- honeydew ham:
I wish there was more prosciutto (jambon / ham) because the honeydew was in abundance and definitely sweet (the waiter revealed the sweetness is balanced with syrup injections)

- lobster tail salad 
Definitely the best dish of all, with perfectly pouched lobster tail and subtle dressing on a crispy bruschetta.

- shrimp ceviche 
The zestiness and heat were perfect and the shrimp was perfectly fresh.

- octopus a la Gallega
Octopus texture was incredible: not at all chewy. I wish the paprika was used more sparingly because it covered up the fish flavor. 

- yellowtail tiradito 
Yum! Fresh and creative. 

And for dessert: 
- Crema Catalana

When I called ZinBurger to inquire about their ""Vegetable Burger"", I was told it was made with eggs but that if I could wait about an hour before coming in the chef would prepare one without eggs to accommodate a vegan. 

I though that was awesome and I was very thankful! 

So we get there and of course I order my ""Vegetable Burger"" with no cheese and no mayo. I also asked how it was prepared: fried? 
The waitress told me they were grilled, another plus! 

Husband orders the Samburger, No thousand, add an egg and we shared an order of hand cut fries. 

Food arrives, it looks good. Although I notice my burger was not grilled it was most definitely pan fried, but it wasn't greasy at all so I was OK with that. 
What I was not OK with is the fact that it is called a ""Vegetable Burger"" and it is in fact a ""Black Bean Burger"" and should read as such on the menu. If I had known it was comprised 99% of black beans I would have likely chose another restaurant to eat at.
 It was just bland I had to slather it in mustard for any flavor and I only ate half. 

On a scale of 1-10, 10 being best ever, Husband gave his burger and Creme Brulee shake a 9.

Once on the plane before they close the door the flight attendant brings you a tag that was attached to the crate to confirm that my dog was onboard.  Relief when you get that tag.

First things first- I'm a pescatarian and I absolutely love that they offer a meatless/vegetarian/vegan burger option that isn't a craptastic variation of a ""bean"" burger. Bean based burgers are almost always a culinary abomination- too messy, too crumbly, taste nothing like an actual ""burger"", too many weird chunks of food in there, they always fall apart after the first bite, taste is sometimes really bad, etc., etc. 

Aioli doesn't bother with this nonsense. Instead they offer the Beyond Burger which is an excellent veggie friendly substitute you can find in some grocery stores.

Aioli has several great burgers that can be made with a Beyond patty instead of meat. My fave is the Italiano burger. It has fresh mozzarella, a yummy balsamic sauce, a basil garlic aioli, and a tomato (I leave off the bacon, obvs). This thing is delicious! I am addicted!

I've tried most of their sides- the traditional fries, the sweet potato fries, the onion rings (I think they are not on the menu all the time), the elote, and the roasted farm veggies and literally everything is so tasty. I can't believe how good the food is here considering it seems like ""just"" a burger joint.

They also make amazing and unique shakes and floats. The birthday cake milkshake has actual pieces of cake at the top and it is so freaking yummy I can't even deal. One of the best shakes I've ever had!

I also have to say, the service here is fabulous. Her name escapes me but every time I go in, the nice blonde lady at the counter is SO welcoming and sweet! She makes you feel like a part of the family. I went on my birthday last month and she overheard that it was my special day and at the end of our meal brought me a complimentary piece of cheesecake since she's seen me there a few times. SO NICE! I am bowled over by her kindness every time we visit. I hope this place stays around for a long time and potentially expands. It can get crowded quickly since it's in a small space, but maybe they will open new locations or move to a bigger space (STILL IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD PLEASE!) in the near future.

Great  time if you are totally into 80s music or not.  I found myself transporting back into time in no time.   I was not totally sold on coming here but a group of friends celebrating a birthday decided to make this our last stop after a fun night playing bingo in our 80's attire. 

The 80's cover band was awesome and I quickly found myself dancing in my seat and next onto the dance floor!  The band members were dressed in nerdy attire and they were so entertaining. 

The place was packed with all age groups dressed in normal to crazy 80's attire.  There were couples and groups of people showing off their moves (among other things) and there were for sure moves I had never seen or maybe conveniently forgot about. 

I can't recall the exact price of the cover charge but it was ridiculously inexpensive and I do remember thinking they could total charge more. I really had forgotten how much fun the 80's were and Spazmatics brought it all back.

Really awesome time and would most definitely return!",2014-10-27 15:07:17
jbvFbNqXFi-n3IiWPUbezg,PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg,4,2,1,2,"ARIA is probably not the best hotel on the Strip but it sure is nice (and well situated in the middle of the Strip) - if you're looking for both comfort and location, ARIA definitely has the right touches.  

Cost-wise, everything is (unsurprisingly) a bit on the high side from restaurants to coffee and whatnot.  There are some cheaper eats if you don't mind walking a little bit across the street like at Planet Hollywood - just be aware that you're going to pay for a bit more nearby.  Still, even though they're price, you do have some solid choices like Julian Serrano to Lemonagrass.  

The casino floor is relatively classy and fairly nice.  It is smoky sure but it has definitely a more mature feel to it with some piano moves going on at a bar to the nice number of tables all-around.  

Service on our part was pretty solid all around.  The only drawback I had was the wait for the room which was going to be hours longer than expected.  Luckily, I was motioned to go to a customer service rep. who helped me get a room immediately (had to slightly downgrade to a lower floor but the rep. was kind enough to still make it as high as possible).  Everything else also came on time or fairly quickly whether it was the housekeeping to the luggage.  

The king bed room itself was awesome.  Smaller than a suite but thought the bed was super comfy and the tech. in the room was cool (the shades opened up automatically as I walked in which was a great touch).  The restroom was also neat and beautiful.  I thought the decor of the hallways were a little too retro but everything else design-wise was great (especially love the lobby which is always decorated with something beautiful).

One final worthy note is the location.  It's really centralized so you can really not go too wrong unless you have to be the far north or south of the strip.  Otherwise, the Cosmo/Monte Carlo/Planet Hollywood are a simple walk away.  

All-in-all, it's not the best hotel stay I had in the world but it was well worth the price and worth the location.",2016-02-23 23:21:47

As an avid traveller, I have eaten in many establishments from mom and pop hole in the wall restaurants to top of the line fine dining from Seattle to California.

This place has the potential to be the place to dine in old Scottsdale with an awesome location and great patio, and old school charm, I have to say that was the main reason we stopped in.  I agree completely with the other reviewers that you should check your bill before paying because the bill is filled in by hand so you really have to know your prices or else you could be paying more than what the menu price is.  Really, a restaurant in the heart of Old Scottsdale should be electronic in 2015.

To start, no host, just an older fellow in street clothes (Jimmy Hendrix golf shirt) wandering the parameter of the patio and inside, and a heavy set gentleman tending to obvious regulars, over zealous as he was, seemed like a nice guy, that is if you were a regular...""how's you's doin? You's need anyting else?"" as I overheard.

Our waiter was nice enough, older guy who was just ok, but felt that he kept trying to up-sell us on booze and on bread...I'm off carbs but my husband gave in and we agreed. We specifically asked that there be no pork in any of the dishes, and was assured that won't be an issue.

Starter salad was way overdressed and was basically bagged lettuce mix with one slice of cucumber. Hello tomatoes? Onions? Olives? Anyone? Fail.

I tried the tomato cheese bread, because it looked really good and who doesn't love gooey, melty cheese? It was good but definitely not worth the $8 price tag for 4 small pieces, sauce was really acidic and the tomatoes on the bread were obviously canned. 

The entrees all arrived with a pasta, while there was a veg option, we were never offered this and was told after the fact that I should have asked for it. Luckily my sons dish came with little chunks of bacon so he ended up eating the side of pasta that came with my dish ( it was not mentioned anywhere in the description but we made sure to mention it when ordering the spaghetti and meat sauce for my other son, that there is not not be any pork in any of the dishes.) I ordered the steak of the day which was supposed to be a ribeye (it was not...and it was way over done) no sides with the steak just a slab of meat swimming in a butter lemon sauce.

 The waiter was nice enough to offer to make another dish for my kid without the bacon but seemed upset, when we pointed out the obvious mistake.  Then we noticed big meat chunks in the spaghetti in my other kids dish and he assured us that it was not pork...I wasn't buying it because it was very white in color and at this point I cut it open in front of him and showed him the color- said he was sure that they only use beef.  I just had to take his word for it and accept this entire dining experience as an expensive lesson learned.  

Bill was just under $100 with no drinks/booze, one app and 3 dishes...I later realized that $5 was tacked on to cover my sons starter salad even though he couldn't eat his meal because of the bacon- it's not a big deal but felt that was really tacky when it was obviously their mistake.  Getting nickel and dimed and skepticism for what really was in our food is enough for me to not go back,",2015-02-16 07:33:10

And. It was SOOOO anticlimactic. Unbelievably disappointing. I went with a fellow Honest Ed's virgin and as soon as we walked out, we both said, ""Dollarama is better"".

All those years, I saw awesome deals in the windows. $4 sweatpants! $1.99 slippers! All sorts of cheap goodies! And then when I stepped inside and literally just saw bins upon bins of...garbage? My dreams of a giant cheapness heaven were crushed. It was just a huge space filled with junk. :(

Honest Ed's is very similar to dollar stores, and Giant Tiger and all those other chains, except they are more of a department store in the sense that you can buy figure skates and baby strollers and wall art here as well as many floors of useless crap that may indeed have come off the back of a truck.

It's an interesting place to check out, but, tourists, please don't let this gargantuan garage sale be the representation of Toronto that you leave here with.

We got to the park around 6:30, and the fireworks were not scheduled until 9pm. It's a very large park with plenty of room for hundreds to set up camp and enjoy a show. Food trucks were set up on the street and the local PD did a great job blocking streets and patrolling to keep the evening safe and secure and make access on the way into the evening very easy. The firework show was well done, but lacked speakers/music loud enough for the far west side of the park to hear, so for people watching in that area it was a quiet show. The large, and normally gorgeous to look at, fountain remained on the entire show and obstructed the view depending on vantage point. This is something that was not a big deal, but made low flying fireworks appear hazy.

I was pleased with this restaurant. They had great food and offered lots of variety in the menu, including rice dishes, pho, buns, and more. I never tried quail but it was surprisingly good (it tastes like a saltier/chewier/bonier version of chicken if you're curious). The sauce on top of the quail topped off the appetizer - I would recommend it. We had another appetizer - the tofu spring rolls. It tasted very healthy and clean, and I liked the peanut sauce that came with it. 

I ordered the chicken ""bun"" noodles, which had rice noodles, lettuce, chicken smothered in sauce and a side of fish sauce. My friend got the vegetarian pho, which she enjoyed. 

The server checked in pretty often and were very polite and helpful with our order. While we were unfamiliar with some of the menu items (like the quail), she provided us a detailed explanation of what the appetizer would entail. I'm glad that she did, because it convinced us to get the order. Yum yum!

I'd been here once before for an Elite event, and remember the good times, and great food, but I wrote a review for the event. Now, I am proud to write this review and share this lovely restaurant with you.

The lunch menu is fairly simple ($10 per dish). Each item comes with house salad or soup. Get the salad with their house dressing. It's a fantastic balsamic vinaigrette. The plate is glazed with a balsamic reduction for show. And it's sexy.

My Dad and I ordered the Chicken Parm. It came with a side of rigatoni. It was so nice, The chicken was nicely breaded and crispy. Not oily, but had a baked in taste.

My angel of a mother had the Salmon which was topped with a lemon caper sauce, and also had a side of rigatoni. It was a fantastic combo.

The dinner menu is a bit more upscale ($25-$50), but I recommend this place for any special meal. The restaurant has been in business for over 25 years, and they know what they are doing.

A special date. Don't bring an ONS here. 
An announcement dinner: ""We're getting married:

I'm not into knick-knacks and had a tough time choosing an item to paint from their rather large selection of ceramic pieces which range from signs to hang on your wall to picture frames, serving platters, and bookends. You pay for the item you choose to paint and the store provides the supplies - paint, brushes, stencils and stickers, sponges - anything you can think of to help create your masterpiece. 
What I found that I enjoyed the most out of this was that it was relaxing. I'm constantly on the go and it's often difficult for me to mellow out with my yap shut. When it was all said and done, meticulously working on a small art project for a few hours actually bounced me back better to me than an afternoon siesta. I can't say that I'm going to do this on a regular basis but I tried it, I enjoyed it, and it's been filed in the mental rolodex.",2009-08-03 21:16:24

But before I get into that, I just wanted to mention the great vibe this place had.  The place is just a few weeks old so the staff had that wonderful enthusiasm that I hope doesn't wither as they establish themselves.  Keep it up, team!

We were given a customized box that consisted of salmon, seaweed salad, crab salad, edamame, pineapple, zucchini noodles, crispy ramen, crispy onions, house sauce, spicy mayo, sesame seeds and sushi rice.  You may have just read that and thought, ""Wow! Look at all those ingredients!"".  Now here's what I have to personally say about this: dis tew much.  Mind you, I loved the house sauce and the crunchy ramen but again, it was too much.  There was way too much going on.  With all that's going on, you would think that they would have some avocado in there which is a key ingredient in a poké bowl, or in their case, a box.  With all the ingredients, the amount of fish was also not as generous as I had hoped especially compared to previous poké spots.  If I had to pay full price for the amount of fresh fish, I would've been a little disappointed.  

If I may, I'd recommend cutting down on the extra ingredients such as edamame, pineapple and zucchini noodles or at least instead of the noodles, present it in small cubes. Also, please throw some avocados in there. If you're going to skimp out on the fish, the avocados will at least add some of the buttery texture and flavour to the dish.  It would also probably go great with your house sauce.  

I'd rate the box itself 3/5 but overall rating a 4/5 as I'd still like to be considerate of their warm hospitality and also the presentation.",2016-11-10 03:11:21

I really wanted my experience here to be better :( 

However, this is only based on the cupcakes. I have passed this place quite a few times, as well as seeing them on TLC. I had always wanted to stop in & try them out, which I finally did.

The shop is definitely very nicely decorated & clean. The staff was very friendly & helpful. On the day I was there, the owner was making a cake of the Palms, for George Maloof. It did look pretty cool too. She was the one who actually helped me as well.

I ordered Red Velvet, Strawberry, & Peanut Butter Cup cupcakes, & they definitely looked great! Unfortunately, that is about the only good thing I can say about them. The cupcakes were pretty dry, almost like they may have been a little overcooked. The frosting was too grainy & didn't really have too much flavor, with the exception of the Peanut Butter Cup, which was pretty good. 

I don't know if maybe I came too late in the day, it was close to 3 in the afternoon, but that really shouldn't make too much of a difference. However, I think I will definitely give them another shot, just for the fact that I want to try the ""Island"" flavors ;) Having lived on Oahu for 4 years, I gotta show my support! That was a major reason why I moved here afterward in the first place. After all, Vegas is the 9th island :D",2011-02-14 01:23:12

The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).

However, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.

In general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu...",2012-07-16 01:17:34

Devastatingly disappointed.  I started with the scallops & calamari...which were good.  The homemade bread & pesto was good.  Then to the entree.... I had the seafood pasta with garlic sauce, clams, shrimp, scallops, calamari, and mussels.  I was excited to try it because the waitress told me they have fresh seafood brought in daily.  What could be wrong?  Well..the sauce was not was not what I expected.  It was very dry and not creamy as I had hoped.  The seafood on top was extremely fishy.  I have had plenty of pasta seafood dishes and they usually blend very nicely..with a balance of flavors...NOT this one.  Blah!  I sent it back which I despise doing.  I then ordered the lobster ravioli.  Could it get worse? I literally wanted to cry.  The ravioli was black instead of the traditional white. That just grossed me out.  The sauce on top was their house made slightly spicy marinara, which was delicious, but did not go with the ravioli-completely conflicting flavors.  The lobster inside was fishy. Overly upset.  I didn't eat anymore after the first bite.

The dessert was ok..tiramisu had a good flavor but was sort of mushed all together.  Panna cotta was good.  

Service was phenomenal.  Our waitress and even the hostesses were extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  I loved hearing my waitress describe the food..A+ for her.

Ambiance is awesome, feels classy but you definitely can come dressed casual if you're just hanging out in the bar/lounge area. The bartenders are friendly and will make you custom drinks if you ask. I've only had items off of their late night menu, so I can't really comment on the pricing for dinner. For the quality of the steak, the late night menu is very reasonably priced. 

They serve beautifully cooked and seasoned meat, with several different options on the menu. The steak comes cooked with a giant onion ring, which imparts a great flavor and juiciness to the meat. The one thing I dislike is having to order fries or a side dish separately, but the portions are generous so I can't really complain. Cocktails are creative and delicious, but be warned that they are a bit expensive for Madison. 

I recommend coming after a light (read: almost non-existent) dinner so you can splurge and really enjoy your late night meal. Come a little before 10pm so you can get a seat, and be prepared to spend about as much as you would on a moderately priced dinner.",2013-01-27 19:23:56

First off BRAVO for the all day breakfast! And it comes with free soup on the side! Already a fave!

Came here twice in a row, so I feel it's only fair to do a review!

I came during dinner time and lunch time, both times were busy but not packed. As we entered the restaurant, I noticed the decor immediately, from historic pictures of the Philippines and different nik-naks on the shelf symbolizing what Philippine culture is all about. It's great, clean, cozy and kid-friendly.

You have to order in the main cash and if your going to eat in, they will give you your receipt and a table number.

For lunch: 
I ordered Tapsilog (fried sliced beef with rice and eggs. It also comes with pickled veggie called Atchara and a slice of cucumber and tomatoe) , and Iced Tea (mmm, refreshing!) While my Dad ordered rice with Caldereta (Tomatoe base beef stew with peppers).  Both dishes were a good portion and they both came with soup! The soup is a beef base I believe, just by looking at the dark colour and the bold taste it has. It's not salty. It's just right!! You can serve yourself ice water by the cutlery station. 

The service was fast and the servers were kind!

For Dinner:
I ordered longsilog ( Filipino sweet breakfast sausage and rice with egg), also came with soup. My Fiancé  got the Beef Pares Silog ( beef adobo like stew) with rice and eggs. Both dishes were Great! No complains, I just had too much rice #firstworldproblems 
We also ordered the siomai and it was really good!! A must try, the sauce is what made this dish amazing! 

My only concern about this place is, if a first timer came into this restaurant, I wouldn't know that I had to place my order first, and second the people ordering for take out, all wait in the front after ordering and it just makes it more congested in the front and some servers get confused and flustered.

-Qpjbs2W_0Sfq5Auxvf5Dg,kxz6Q2AERQeo9x6nnbHZNg,UC2dfjZg8mrRh10maovQfw,2,3,1,1,"I realllly wanted to like this place based on the reviews that I've read, but unfortunately the quality of food I received along and the price tag was too disproportionate for me to give this place an A-OK rating. Price wise I would say they are trying to get at the level of Skyview, Dragonboat and Spring Villa which is obviously higher end. They also had a lot of over the top dishes like Shark Fin Siu Mai to ""justify"" this slightly higher pricing. However the aforementioned Siu Mai was dry and tasteless with 2 slivers of shark fin. I personally am anti-shark fin so that's fine BUT I do get the feeling that a normally s/m dish is now being charged as an L dish for two slivers of shark fin. 

Second example of disappointment was the big bun (Dai Bao). It had obvious signs of being re-steamed (the dough was mushy at certain parts) and was definitely not fresh and nor did it taste like it was. We didn't come here too late in the day so the re-steaming can't easily be justified.

Final disappointment was the durian puff pastry that I was reaaaallly looking forward to since I'm a huge durian fan. The pastry was neither buttery nor flaky. In fact it was powdery and tasted like flour. The durian filling also tasted like it was mixed with a disproportionate amount of flour which is especially disappointing when it is being sold as an L dim sum meaning that it's one of the more $$ dishes. That's some pricey flour I got there. 

(Note the 3 examples were not the ONLY disappointments but the most memorable ones) 

The only reason to justify a return to this is for the early bird special. Since there are more L, XL, and SP dishes than there are S/M dishes it will turn out to be more worthwhile during early bird b/c the feeling of being ripped off will be lessened. Otherwise I will not recommend this place aside from good decor and mediocre service. There are better high end dim sum places out there with food that actually warrants the price tag. They do have an interesting menu, I only wish that they were able to execute properly.",2014-06-28 01:24:21

I did not think you could have a gastronomical meal with Portuguese cuisine. I was wrong... Very wrong. This was a delectable experience on every level. 

Is it expensive? Yes, about 70/person, no alcohol. 
Is it worth it? Yes, it's that good. When a restaurant offers such a wide array of fresh fish, it's only normal that the meal is priced accordingly, without mentioning the downtown location.

Enough about details... Let's talk about the food.
Salmon tartare: fresh, delicious (If I must criticize, chopped a little too coarsely for my taste).
Octopus: absolutely delicious. Well balanced and originally garnished. 
Fried calamari: simple but very good.
Black cod: great... Just great.
Seafood rice: so tasty and everything was exceptionally fresh. 
Mixed desserts: wonderful. 

The service is friendly and impeccable. The restaurant is beautiful. Reservations are strongly recommended.

Note: yes, there are good options when it comes to Portuguese dining in Montreal, but no one comes close to Ferreira for quality, freshness, taste and service. Enjoy!",2015-09-24 02:42:15

We had tuna tataki, langostino roll, Philadelphia Roll (in honor of the Phillies advancing to the NLCS), spicy tuna roll some gyoza and miso.  Our intent was to have enough to bring home, and we certainly did.  The tuna tataki was the star of the show - I would recommend that anyone who has not been to Sushi Ken should give it a try just for the tataki.  It was excellent - and only $6.95 for a very generous portion.  I was stunned.  The langostino roll was spicy and delicious for and the Philadelphia roll was pretty standard - which is not a criticism, Philly rolls are what they are.  The spicy tuna roll was over the top with spicy tuna mounded on top of a normal spicy tuna roll.  Very impressive for the price and in comparison to other places.

I've often heard other say they have long wait times of 30 mins or so, but my cousin and I have tended to be pretty lucky in the sense that we're always seated the moment we walk in.  I don't recall ever waiting once.  Then again it's always the two of us, I'm sure if we had a big party it would be a longer wait.  And we're also always willing to sit next to the bar or at the bar if it means getting seated faster. Sitting at the bar and eating my food isn't going to kill me, it's not the end of the world.  You can still see the person next to you and hear them talk.

I'd suggesting calling by phone and making reservations before leaving your house to drive there.  If the average wait time I see for larger parties is 30 minutes and it takes you 30 minutes to get there, then it should work out just perfectly.

I see a lot of negative reviews on here, which it's been 4 months since I've been here but I'm surprised if it went down hill that quickly.  For now I'll still say I'll go back when my cousin is in town next month.  Perhaps I'll update my rating then.",2014-04-19 16:19:17

Today totally different story. I had gotten a full set last week. One of my nails broke and I went to get it repaired. I went in yesterday (Tuesday) David who originally did my set wasn't there. So I had to see Elvis (which I didn't want to bc I read a bad review about her from the previous day). I did anyways because I could not walk around with one broke nail. She did not seem excited to work with me either. When she finished my nails were not straight. She also didn't talk to me I had to engage the conversation. When she was done she turned around and talked to an employee the whole time and was on her phone. And just seemed so MISERABLE TO BE THERE. Today (Wednesday the nail she repaired broke again. I called and spoke to Julie (owner) she said they would fix it. I told her I wanted her or David to fix. I got there and they put me with Taylor. I originally wanted my broken nail fixed but decided to cut them down bc they were not straight or even so I cut them down and did shellac color. Taylor did an amazing job and was very friendly. She was going to charge me for the color. Which is what I thought I was being charged anyways when I spoke to Julie on the phone bc Elvis clearly did a bad job the 1st time. I get the cash register and Elvis comes to ring me up. She starts questioning Taylor and then Decides I need to be charged more then shellac. Asks Julie (owner) and they charge me for cut down and color $40 and I paid $10 for repair yesterday. I have been in then customer service industry for years and I did not receive good service from owner and employee Elvis. It was her mistake she did my nail to thin and it broke but I ended up paying for her mistake. I also drive 30 min to go there bc I do think everyone else in that building does a good job but they lost a customer after today. I will not be going there again. I recommend not seeing Elvis!

The problem I had with The Summit is that I wasn't sure what kind of place it was trying to be. It had all the looks and feeling of a ""modern"", trendy bar - with garage door walls and cool lights - but it really liked some sort of cohesive atmosphere. The The staff treated us like we were at a dive bar. They pretty much never came back to us unless we hog-tied them and getting a smile and anything less than an awkward shrug seemed difficult. This would've been fine if I were only paying $3-6 for my beer, but I paid $9.

Also, the layout was odd. There was all of this space in the middle that could've been used for more cocktail tables. 

Overall, I wouldn't be against going here, but it probably won't be from my own suggestion. If they offered some appetizers or finger foods, then it might be more appealing. I think the service needs to match the look and then it would score a little more.",2013-10-24 15:16:43

The restaurant ambivalence is clean, rustic- modern. I would recommend a seat by the bar if you are dining with a dyad so you can watch the cooks/bartenders do their thang. 

We ordered the special seafood ceviche, grilled octopus, and curried lamb. 

The ceviche was a mix of different ingredients that reminded me of a smaller Singaporean slaw, but it was bland to me. It didn't really mash together for some reason for me. $24

Grilled octopus was flavourful and soft. We ordered this because other yelpers recommended it. It was good. I liked the presentation and taste. 

The lamb was to die for! My fave thing from what we ordered. It was moist, tender, and soft. The presentation was very pretty. I liked the pineapple curried sauce. Beware of the green sauce, it's spicy. I liked the pairing of quinoa banana. Gave a nice contrast to the dish. Definitely my fave! 

The drinks looked nice, but were underwhelming. We had the and also, and Georgetown storm. It wasn't very creative and it was a bit watered down for me. I would say, I liked the cocktails at Dailo way better. 

Overall, i felt bent was a bit of a copy cat of lee in the sense that some of the menu items were from lee's, like the Singaporean slaw and tong yuen. I was disappointed that it didn't have a lot of its own uniqueness.

I came here on Saturday 2/22/14, with flu like symptoms. Since we just got done eating at Jackson's Bar and Grill off of Jones and Flamingo, this place was the closest one to us (Off of Durango and Flamingo) that was still open.

As soon as you come in, you have to do a double take because the first thing you see are modern furniture and nice paintings on the walls. At this point I thought I must of been really sick or because I thought I was hallucinating. You would think you walked into an Ikea that doubles as an art museum. The décor looks nothing like a walk-in medical clinic. There is even a nice sized flat screen tv down on one end. 

So my wifey signs me in and she fills out paperwork for me. Shout out to my wifey for taking care of me this whole time! As we sit on the really comfortable love seats with what I assume was simulated leather, (Because why would a walk-in clinic have really nice leather furniture?) I cant help but look around and actually keep thinking to myself how this waiting room looks more like the lobby to what you might find in a nice hotel.

After about 10 minutes they call us in. At this point, my wife had to wake me up because the love seat were sitting in was that comfortable. I would not have minded waiting even longer because who wouldn't want to get a nap in before getting seen by the doctor? That sounds crazy saying I wouldn't mind waiting longer when the average normal person just wants to get in and out as soon as possible. 

So the doctor's assistant does all the basic stuff like checking my vitals, etc. Then the doctor comes in, does his thing, and then im sent back out to the lobby to wait for my paperwork of prescriptions to finish. I would say from the time we walked in to the time we were dismissed took about 45 minutes. That would be the equivalent of the Jimmy John's motto that they are so fast that it will make you freak!

In conclusion, I am doing this review a couple days later feeling much better and remembering just how nice the receptionist (and cute too!) was including the doctor's assistant. The doctor himself deserves a lot of kudos as well for he went over everything I needed to know and I thought he genuinely cared for my well being. I guess I was so sick that I didn't get anybody's names but if I ever go back there again for any reason, I will update this review accordingly. I also wanted to add that the bathrooms there were very nice and very clean. I know this place is still new but im hoping that the service stays superior and that the 5 stars I gave them wont drop down any further than a 4 because any walk-in medical clinic with great service is hard to find.

It's definitely one their most flavorful dishes on the menu. The chorizo adds a whole new depth of flavor and every now and then you get that hint of cilantro which meshes well with the tomato-based background.

I was very impressed with what Mason's Creamery had to offer. Egg waffles, which are very difficult to find in the states, were sold here as a an accompaniment to the ice cream selection. The ice cream selection itself was very unique, as they made their own ice cream flavors and the selection changes on an almost daily basis.

The Facebook page mentioned that Mason's was serving Ovaltine ice cream, something I really wanted to try as Ovaltine is a staple breakfast drink for me. While they didn't have Ovaltine available that day, I was able to sample hot chocolate flavored ice cream instead, something I had NEVER had before. It was very very good, and had all the flavors one might expect from a hot chocolate, only frozen. The salted caramel, a more common ice cream flavor, tasted a lot better than what I'm used to from other places, so I ended up getting an egg waffle with salted caramel ice cream, hot chocolate ice cream, and Nutella whipped cream.

Talk about pushing the boundaries of ingredients and experimenting with brand new flavors. I'm often skeptical about new fusion styles, but Mason's nails it with the execution. The Nutella whipped cream has all the texture of whipped cream but all the rich flavors of Nutella. The egg waffle, rather than being stored and used like other waffle cones, is made fresh on order and tastes really soft and chewy. The salted caramel and hot chocolate flavors blended very well with the whipped cream, and the egg waffle absorbed all the flavors very well. Everything fit together super nicely, rather than being a mish mash of different flavors that were fighting each other for dominance.

It's rare for me to have ice cream this good, and it definitely ranks among the best I've ever had. This place is HIGHLY recommended to anyone looking for a one of a kind ice cream experience.",2017-02-19 16:41:08

We didn't know what to expect, but after seeing that most of the customers were Asian, that was a good sign!

The beef and five kinds of mushroom dish (with a generous helping of wood ear, button, straw, enoki and abalone mushrooms) was seasoned perfectly and made our son very happy!   The Shanghai noodles with shredded pork was devoured in less than 5 minutes.
      Despite the fact that the steamed man tow (soft white fluffy buns) with condensed milk was not on the dinner menu, our server was able to accommodate my son's request (man tow is one of his favorites).   The salt and pepper squid was fabulous--it was fried to perfection with a minimal amount of batter and best of all, there were no raw onions on the plate!

Between the 2 of us, we have tried 3 sandwiches (usually, we split one 8"" sub; can't remember what we had on the first visit. But, 2nd visit was a Meatball Sub. And on the 3rd visit, she wanted to try the Hook N Ladder Lite, so I had another 8"" Meatball sub all to myself 8) ). But, when we split a sub, the staff brings the sandwich in 2 trays with a slice of pickle for each of us. :o 

But, I was surprised to see some complaints about the cost. For what I get at Firehouse subs (1, 8"" Sub and 2 Small drinks), I usually can only get the sandwich at another place that I go to.

Also, they ask for your name and give you a number, usually (only got a number 2x). Personally, this double-redundancy is probably not needed for the size of the place. But, I can't see taking off anything for it.

The steak is freshly grilled and you can see fire go up as the griller puts a new steak on.  T-bones are good, but really gotta be careful with the rib steak.  I've had some good ones and some super chewy ones.  Today, I asked for medium and my steak came rare plus.  Not perfect grilling, if you ask for a medium expect a medium rare to medium well.

We'll get to that later.  I was here about 2 weeks ago on a Friday night because I was craving fried catfish (yes in Phoenix) and some really good potatoes.  I yelped ""Catfish near 85016"".  Texas Roadhouse didn't come up with in the first 2 pages so I took my researching skills to Google :)  I know steakhouses usually have different kinds of fish options so I checked Outback Steakhouse first .. no catfish.  I checked Longhorn second ... no catfish.  Then it hit me ""Texas Roadhouse"".  I checked the menu out online, saw catfish listed, along with various options to dress my potato.  Win!!  

Again .. it was a Friday night ... around 9ish.  There wasn't a wait at all but I sat at the bar anyway.  I decided not to drink and opted for freshly brewed peach sweet tea instead.  It was delicious!  I ordered a 3 piece catfish dinner with seasoned rice and a side salad.  It came out within 20 minutes, pippin' hot and oh so damn good!  The salad was a little on the Blah side but I did't care that much.  The other options for sides were green beans, sautéed apples, a sweet potato (loaded or not), regular potato (loaded or not), mashed potatoes, cole slaw and fries.  The catfish dinner was pretty big so I had plenty of leftovers to take home. 

My boyfriend loved the leftovers so much he said .. Man .. We gotta go back tomorrow.  So we did :)  We went back to Texas Roadhouse the very next day and shared the 3 piece catfish dinner with a loaded sweet potato and seasoned rice to -go.  We live about 13 minutes away.

The octopus appetizer was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, which is one of the hardest culinary feats. Most places overlook it, but they prepared it so it cut like butter. Served with a great olive tapenade.

Yum!  The hot dog was good quality and the chili was better than I expected.  Had a side of potato salad that was pretty good also.  They have a refrigerator case for your drinks, cans of soda are only $1.  They also had glass bottles of Coke and Pepsi.

If you are feeling mildly, but not completely, adventurous the bento boxes are a great compromise, where you can try the burger of the week, sweet potato fries, sushi, edamame and the thai cucumber salad. I don't care for the cucumber salad and they will double up on edamame instead if requested. If you are all in for the fusion experience, I liked the Taste Explosion Roll or the Turfin' Surfer Roll.

I got the potato rosti to start, and I think it may have been my favourite course.  It was interesting and a bit different, with quail egg and arugula (I think).  The bf's mushroom soup was good, but a member of our other dining couple who also had it commented that it could use a bit more creaminess and I agree.  

Entrees!  I had the hanger steak, which was perfectly cooked and swimming in a very good jus.  Onion rings crowned the steak, accompanied by big fat fries, which were good but didn't blow my mind.  Beef got the whitefish, which had a crunchy pilaf going on--solid but not amazing.  Our companions got the fish and the veggie gnocchi, the latter of which seemed to leave the worst impression of all our entrees; not just a few little pasta buds were left unfinished.  

We ordered cocktails--which is to say, I ordered cocktails for bf and I--being inexplicably indifferent to the steep price point ($14-$16) that ranged from very good to just okay.  The cocktail offerings are unique, but I'm not sure that all of the somewhat esoteric ingredients made their way to my taste buds.  The alcohol, however, reliably made its way to my head in time for dessert.

I got the banana bread pudding, which had caramel slathered liberally on its top.  The pudding itself was a bit jiggly/moist for my taste--the kind of texture that reheated bread pudding takes on.  Beeef got the semifreddo, an ice-creamy custard type dish, and it was stellar if small.  Another of our companions insisted that I try the chocolate cake and I was glad I did because it may have been the best I've ever had.  Rich, and just the right balance between dense and fluffy.  I'd go back and order just that and wine.  

Atmosphere and decor:  beautiful--high ceilings, soft lighting, pretty art.  It has the rustic-modern feel that many TO establishments are sporting, but it pulls it off on a pretty grand scale.   

I have a tough time pinpointing what it was about Boehmer that just didn't do it for me, and I guess at the end of the night, I hadn't felt strongly about any one dish.

Fur dinner, the entrees, lack invention and the kitchen lacks consistency necessaryto qualify for a higher rating. For their price point, one would expect something a little more ""cheffy"" on the menu. Rosewood does not provide that type of selection. Just what I would call a more or less standard menu. 

In the end, I will continue to take up my stool at the bar, have a couple drinks and enjoy the atmosphere, but I won't be joining them for dinner.",2017-11-06 19:16:31

Cons: None, place is pretty great

It's a good idea to pick up one of the menus as you walk in (and before you step up to the ordering counter) because there's a lot to choose from!  Their speciality is rotisserie chicken with a Mexican or Tex-Mex flair.  My favorite dish is the chicken and black bean combo con queso.  Why?  It's chicken, two sides/veggies, black beans, and cheese.  YUM.  Top that with one of their hot sauces and I've got a double YUM.  Now comes the difficult part:  deciding which two side items from the list of about 15.    Garlic or mashed potatoes?  Spinach?  White bean au gratin?  Baked apples?  AARGH.  I can't decide!

The red curry came in a little bowl on a plate with rice, a small eggroll, wonton chips, and a dipping sauce. I thought that the dish was a bit small compared to other Thai restaurants I have been to. Since I went during lunchtime, it also included a small bowl of soup at the beginning. The soup was very salty and flavorful. I think the soup was mostly a strong chicken broth with a garlic flavor and it had some rice in it.

We travel extensively (and have spent many nights in 5 star hotels) and found this experience to be most excellent. The check-in process was efficient. Era was attentive and made sure that she assisted in making this stay memorable by offering a complimentary upgrade and other tips - she was just wonderful! Our suite was quite well appointed and modern. We were on the 50th floor and had a fantastic view of the strip and airport. One of the best aspects of this hotel was housekeeping - this is something that I don't often comment about, but the housekeeping staff was so friendly and attentive. The room was serviced each morning and night and it was quite apparent that careful attention was paid to ensure that the room was in pristine condition. The staff would even ensure that my iPhone charger was neatly placed near the bed. They were always friendly and engaged with the hotel guests. 

We have visited the spa in the past and highly recommend a Spa Suite. We dined at Aria Cafe and had a very average experience. The dinner menu was limited and the service was a bit slow, but the food was good. We took advantage of the lounge and refreshments that are offered to the Sky Suite guests on a few occasions and enjoyed this. We had a car while in town and parked in the self park garage. We were always able to find a parking space and the walk into hotel wasn't excessive. WiFi was included and was fast enough that I could work efficiently.

And up until just a few seconds ago, I was still completely uninformed about the significance of ""Blue Ox"", except it has some connection to Minnesota.  So if you are curious about the name, here is a brief Cliff Notes notation about this trivia:

Blue Ox is actually named Babe, and is Paul Bunyan's animal companion.

Blue Ox was also a professional roller hockey team based in Minneapolis, MN, that used to played in the Roller Hockey International League.

But if you are expecting the interior of the tavern/sports bar to be all blue, you will be disappointed.  Hues of light pink is what you will most likely be covered with regardless of where you decided to park your hiney for the duration of your visit. But don't worry, your eyes are very good at filter that out, but it could get problematic when you try to take pictures of your food, menu or other picture worthy subject matters.  

Anyway, I was here recently to catch the slightly more than half of the most boring Super Bowl event in recent memory. The place was fairly busy, but there were still a few tables and booth that were unoccupied when I walked in.  The average age of the patron was easily over 35 (and I am lowballing my guestimate), so if you are looking for young wild and crazy sports bar scene, this is probably not your best bet.  Best surprise of the afternoon was the complimentary half time buffet that was sponsored by a local law firm (the hot links and other sausages and sides were a definite hit).

Their regular menu is your typical, non-gourmet bar food.  You have your appetizers (mostly fried items and nachos), salads, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast items.  I had a bowl of soup (changes daily), and one of their burgers on both visits.  Food is decent and portion is relatively large (but nothing to rave about in our local weekly magazines), and most items are under $10.  

Service is decent. The waitresses checks up on you regularly, so your refills or next order of beer is practically effortless.  If you stop in to this sports bar when there are no games on, you could save $1 with your Yelp Check-in off.

Overall, I like this vintage sports bar that has persevered through the years with the occasional event promotions to draw in regulars and snag a few newbies.  Good experience if you are looking for something different from your regular routine.

Double check! After Ling Long Legend closed down at FMP I was really concerned that I would no longer have a go to hand pulled noodle place to satiate my cravings. Then I discovered Magic Noodle who makes equally good chinese hand pulled noodles and along with an extensive menu of northern chinese snacks and apps! 

On my visit I tried a few of their skewers and the noodles and was very pleased with the flavours in the dishes. The noodles had the perfect bite (in my opinion) and the skewers were hot and juicy without being overly seasoned. Super happy to have this as a go to northern chinese lunch place that offers affordable pricing and reasonable portions!

Be warned for lunch time though since they tend to get really busy. I would recommend visiting during non-busy hrs so you don't have to risk waiting outside for a table!",2014-06-28 01:10:07

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of macarons and will spend the money necessary for a tiny piece of heaven in my mouth. Since I've heard a ton of good things about Coquette, I was ecstatic to finally try this place out! Imagine my surprise when the first highly anticipated bite of Coquette's macaron took me on a long road of ""Meh"". 

Coquette really tries to go above and beyond with their macaron flavors and presentation. The few times I've been here, they had a variety of macarons ranging from mango lassi, drunken cherry, bubble gum, spearmint, and avocado. Of course, they also have the boring flavors of chocolate and vanilla. Being the adventurous Yelper that I am, I opted to try out the mango lassi, bubble gum, spearmint and avocado. YOLO! 

Avocado: Bleh. There is absolutely NO flavor to this macaron. It felt like I was eating a piece of bread. Avocado is something that goes well with other things, so it would've been better if they added (oh I don't know...) soy sauce or pepper to it? I may be just pulling things out of no where, but it seems to fit their adventurous theme.

Bubblegum: Interesting concept, but no. It tastes really weird. As a little kid, you were taught to never swallow your gum. Well, eating this macaron made me feel like I was breaking all kinds of rules. 

Spearmint: this is one of their specialty macarons, which cost 50 cents more. If you're into mint chocolate chip, then this is your macaron! 

Mango lassi: YUM! This one is actually pretty good. 

Overall, 2 stars for their macarons, but I'll add one more star for the service and decorations and another star for their delicious non-macaron desserts. I've tried to tart citron and le bonbon, both of which are delicious! :)",2014-06-11 15:51:35

My  husband and I have traveled all over the place and have had our share of really good seafood. This place is one of the better places that we have been to (especially considering that there is no ocean nearby). This is hands down the best seafood place we have eaten in Las Vegas.

We used Open Table to make a reservation, as we were not sure how busy it would be. It was a good thing that we did. This place filled up once we were seated (and I understand why!) 

We were here for dinner.... The starters / apps all looked so good that we opted to split 2 of them and split one main dish. We started off with some of the freshest and tastiest Tuna Poke that we have ever had. The serving size was actually more than we were expecting, as well. Our main dish that we split was the sea bass. It was cooked perfectly! We didn't plan on getting dessert here, but we did. We got the chocolate sea salt and caramel (it has chocolate sauce, candied hazelnuts, chocolate crumble, and Nutella gelato).. I'm not a big fan of chocolate but my husband is. I had just a few bites, and it actually worked and wasn't a full overload of chocolate. My husband was happy to eat the rest of it by himself, once I couldn't do any more.

The staff were all very knowledgeable and super friendly. I can see why this place keeps getting such good reviews. It is hard to stand out in such a food place like Las Vegas, but I can see how and why it does. It's one spot that stands out above the others, where you can remember what you ate long after you went there!",2018-03-23 14:10:16

Prices are very reasonable, with packages starting from $7. I was very satisfied with the $10 one. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for! Credit cards are accepted in the front machine. 

Turbo dry does not completely dry, although that is to be expected since this is a machine. Protip: have a microfibre cloth handy for this reason. Additionally, metal parts of tires needed a little more love, but that's something I didn't care about at $7-10 a pop.

 Of course, this is a drive through car wash so it's very fun to sit and go through!

Vacuums are free to use after the drive through. This is where things start sucking... pun intended. The vacuums were extremely weak and I felt like it wasn't sucking anything up. I tried a few others and the sucking power was the same. The air was super weak and I felt like it wasn't picking up a lot of dirt in my car.

All in all, great for a quick car wash and DIY vacuum for the price. I'll do this when I just need my car to look clean and obviously go somewhere else for the thorough hand wash when it really needs it.",2017-10-24 21:45:23

This place is amazing.  I never would have considered coming here if my friend had not needed something and promised me lunch if I went with her.  I don't fish or hunt or do most outdoorsy things, but this place is so cool.

There is a river and fish and a climbing wall and a fudge shop!  Yes, a fudge shop; with very good fudge BTW.

They have everything one would need for the outdoor life and look forward to going back and spending more time going thru most departments (can't see going thru hunting, but you never know).

One and only caveat so far, slow check out.  I went there the day after black Friday and was in a long line with only 1 checker.  1.  ONE.  - They finally brought one other person but didn't seem to make much of a dent.  I hope it's not always like this.",2011-11-30 00:42:23

You never knew what they would have but always interesting things would be on the shelves.  This is how I feel about Practical Art, a little art shop that you would miss if you didn't know it was there.  From baby sweaters knitted by a lady over 90, to small robots, to all kinds of ceramics, to art on the walls, Practical Art has a bit of everything.  I found a candle that reminds me of the fires at the cabin at Kohl's Ranch.  It is a fun shop that has a special showing by a different artist every month.  The real beauty of Practical art is that everything is handmade by Arizona Artists.  So if you want something really individual, you can go there.

I would  park in the back, though they have a few spaces on Central in front.  It is much easier to get in and out.",2018-01-10 01:14:08

Our reservation for 6 diners at 7 was for the beautiful patio, which we always prefer. They have a fire pit and numerous heaters, so we were comfy on a cool fall evening. 

We ordered cocktails, which took some time but they had a full house. Soon after we ordered appetizers and entrees because the apps are so big, three of us had those instead of entrees. 

For the table, we had a cheese tray, loaded with six cheeses, fruit and various breads. Two ordered soup. Tonight they served oriental onion and beef broth with crispy rice, cilantro and a heavenly addition of mushrooms. Mine was outstanding. The other who ordered soup tipped the bowl at the end so as not to miss any!  

One of us had the pecan smoked salmon (app as an entree), two had the Harissa spiced mussels (app as an entree) while the guys had halibut, rag pasta with veal and ahi tuna. 

Nothing but yummy sounds from the girls with the apps as entrees and the halibut entree. I ordered the ahi tuna but also tasted the veal. The tuna was seared perfectly and had a flavorful soy broth to dip into. The veal pasta was excellent as well. 

We were visited by the two house cats during dinner. They weren't looking for handouts. Just wanted to say hi!

As I've previously noted, with some minor updating: ""The rooms here are amazing, as are the guest services. Looking for Spa Day? Well this Hyatt is the place!  Looking for a beautiful sunset dinner by a fire pit?  No question, then you have to come here.  

If you are lucky to be a Diamond Club member, their Regency Club is one of the best in the world.  I would rank this Hyatt alongside Brenner's Park in Baden Baden; the Savoy or Jumeirah Carlton Tower in London for WOW factor. Simply outstanding!  Stay and enjoy the sunsets and Gondola ride after dinner!""

Our couples massage began with a relaxed, tranquil time outside in their shaded portico (photo), sipping cucumber and fruited mineral water, overlooking the Spa's private pool. 

After a few minutes, we were escorted to our room by two massage therapists to select our scented oils. The hour slipped by ever so slowly and was over before we realized it. Wow, they were very professional and made us feel renewed

But that wasn't the end of our visit. Again we returned to the portico and some quiet time by the pool. One of our friends who was also here for a Spa Day soon joined us. We enjoyed some delicious flavored teas for the rest of the afternoon and some good conversation. The shopping in the Hyatt, though small is excellent. 

As noted before, ""...we have stayed at this Hyatt Regency many times when we lived elsewhere.  But now that we live in the valley, it has become a fun place to go for dinning (See: Alto Ristorante e Bar and SWB Southwest Bistro).""  

Come, eat, relax, stay, visit; you'll be glad you did!  Five Stars, simply the best!

B9MeCkXYH9Vhx_at8yw40w,3tLPT5PzOemSed-ERxwSQg,SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw,4,1,0,0,"I came here after reading the reviews. I have bounced around between pizzerias in town and was hoping to find one closer to where I live that I could count on. After moving to town from my native NYC you could say I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but not enough of a snob where I can't/won't admit a good find.

First thing I noticed is that they don't greet you. Maybe if they weren't busy and were waiting for an order they would, but they were moderately busy and there were multiple guys behind the counter. Each and every guy that was behind the counter looked at me at separate intervals, but not once did anybody say ""how you doing, just give us a second here."" I don't need handholding, but  some sort of ""be right with you"" would have been cool.

Guy who took my order was quick and efficient. I ordered and I waited, decent sized order and wait time matched what I ordered, which was fine. They even had it done a bit quicker that I had anticipated. I was taking it to go.

Redeemed the Yelp offer for free garlic knots with a large pizza ordered, which they forgot to give me (the knots lol.) Luckily I said something while still there, and they gladly handled that on the spot. Better to have it happen there than discovering it once I got home.

Ok, now to the food: 

Lg. White Pizza with pepperoni & fresh garlic - very little grease (which is hard to do on a pizza with cheese and pepperoni, so kudos there.) Dough could have been more crisp, but I had read reviews about their crust and knew what to expect. Still really tasty and they don't skimp on the toppings. Nice guys!

Medium Wings - They were ok. I think they would have been better eaten in, not ordered to go. 

Bistro Fries - not bad, just not my cup of tea. Saw pictures on the site/yelp with what looked like stringy cheese. Yeah, there was none of that. One of the reviews raves about them, I wasn't that fond of them. Personal taste, they were fine...I just wouldn't order them again. 

Garlic Knots - tasty, crisp...loved 'em. 

Overall I really like this place! If you come back with your receipt you get half off a pizza within three days...nice touch! I think next time I visit I will order to eat in, I'm confident I will be even more pleased with an order fresh out of the oven. 

Thanks guys! Good stuff! I'll be back!",2018-01-21 17:06:03

We had a great waiter who provided us with great selection and just had an overall friendly demeanor. The prices were shockingly affordable. The pizzas hovered just above $10. Bread and olive oil is served when you are seated. We ordered the antipasto for an appetizer. It was excellent. It was a fairly large platter of different Italian meats and cheeses. I had the salsiccia pizza for my entree. It was great! It was a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce, Italian sausage, and cheese, prepared in a much more gourmet manner than your local Pizza Hut. It definitely had a kick to it. For dessert, I had the nutella macaroons. They were excellent. There were two large macaroons with chocolate, hazelnut, and almond flavoring in them.

We had a reservation and were seated a few minutes late, no big deal. Ordered the stuffed shrimp appetizer, Beef Salad, the Crispy Duck Red Curry (signature dish), and Pad Kee Mow.

The food was above average, but I have definitely had better Thai food for about half the price. The ""Crispy"" Red Duck was not what I expected as the skin was rubbery and inedible, actual duck meat was pretty good though. The ambiance was definitely geared toward younger crowds and dates which was nice. Service was average, the waitress forgot our order of Pad Kee Mow so we had to order it midway through our duck curry. At the end of the meal, we asked to look at the dessert menu and she came back with the check instead. Not the greatest listener.......",2012-07-16 14:17:43

I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.

Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.

My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. 

We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.

The actual takoyaki was nice and hot but it was definitely lacking some sauce and mayo. I want lots! And I was mislead when I ordered takoyaki with cheese I thought the cheese was inside .

Saffron Patch is a tiny bit hard to find since it's in the lower level of an office building. Once you get past the scavenger hunt, it's all good. 

I'll begin by saying that the ambiance was exceptional.... ""for an Indian restaurant in Cleveland."" Let's be honest here people, most Indian joints around here just look terrible and make you want to order take-out. (I said MOST, not ALL. Simmer down. I'm not trying to be offensive. Just honest.)

We had a reservation for my sister's birthday. They put us in an intimate little room with glass, pocket doors. Those doors really came in handy because the place was almost packed and it was very loud in the main dining room. When the doors were open we could barely converse. The acoustics seemed to be a bit dodgy. 

The food was very good. I sampled at least 7 different dishes and none of them were a disappointment .... save for the Tandoori Chicken but that's not the restaurants fault. (It's just a boring dish that people order when they're not sure what else they should be ordering. Again, no offense.) 

The best thing about the meal was the spice factor. They go on a scale of 1-5. I can handle quite a bit of heat but wasn't entirely sure how hot my food would be so I played it safe with a 3. My nose was running a bit with the 3! Others in our party went with a 4 and all were very happy with their respective levels. I think I'll try a 5 next time. 

Only downsides to our meal were that we ordered garlic naan but received plain. And also, the food here seems to be pricier than other Indian establishments. We're probably paying more due to location/high rent factor. Sad face! 

Overall, Saffron Patch was delightful and I'll surely return.",2011-04-22 16:49:11

Tons of great shows come through this town and the NC Music Factory houses quite a few of them. The Fillmore is definitely the premier venue for medium-sized shows that roll through. 

This place is a great size for the acts that make a stop in the Queen City. Tons of floor space and a few chairs lining the main floor around the stage. The one thing that irks a constant venue-goer is the VIP section(s). The upcharge is ridiculous for these areas with hightop tables and chairs. Definitely not worth it unless you're wanting to pay upwards of an extra $30 or more depending on the act. 

All of the equipment in this place is top notch. The sound coming from the stage is always clear and is even better in the back of the room. Always pleased with each show. The staff does a great job of running sound. 

Here's the kicker. The drink prices are insane. If you're looking to score a bud light or something even more high end, have fun paying over $7 for it. Not even craft beer and you want someone to pay $12 for a 16oz beer? Pish posh. 

Parking can also be weird. I've been when it was free and also had it cost $10 to park. Just depends on the weekend, but I'd be sure to keep about $20 of cash on me at all times just to be safe.

The place here is a great addition to leslieville. The decor is modern, yet homely. You wouldn't think you're in a middle eastern place, but it isn't that far removed that it's out of place. 

Food is a bit expensive, but expected. Appetizers (mezze) of hummus and babaganoush with pita can end up being $15, when normally these are staples that are given for free and in generous amounts when in the home country.

I got the Kefta - they have three kinds, one that is plain, one that is sold out and one with tomato sauce. It was tasty, but not mind blowing. 

Service was slow. We were there for a good 30 mins before our food was served. I was also quite disappointed when I took home my meal, that it was in a cardboard box that eventually soaked through, and leaked all over my car. Wasn't fun to clean, nor was it appetizing to eat afterwards.

Numerous questions required visits to others with more knowledge and all were answered clearly and promptly.

All of the food was good to quite delicious, however the pricing is beyond what Scottsdale will tolerate with the number of very good and not quite as pricey offerings in town.

The rye old fashioned was very tasty although $12 for a tumbler with the now hipster single massive cube of ice and maybe, at very most, 3 ounces of liquid left me feeling cheated. Thankfully they did fulfill my request for TWO of the dark cherries (which ended up being Luxardo cherries even though they are not listed that way on the menu.)

We ordered the chicken arancini as an appetizer and when they came out we knew all the portions were going to be very small and overpriced....artfully arranged plate with four, less than golf ball sized, arancini with a tablespoon of very tasty tomato jam, a tiny amount of cilantro cream and four paper thin and minuscule pieces of dried/candied jalapeno for $9. Okay it doesn't sound that expensive right, it was just that the arancini themselves were not that interesting, only the accoutrements which were in short supply.

They split a wedges salad for us in the kitchen (nice touch) and it was very, very good, however with a few tweaks it could be stellar. One issue is that the candied bacon was about too smokey (they smoke it in house) AND that it was chopped up so fine it was like crumbs - no slab or thick cut bacon texture really. We want to see and feel that baconness... A nice add was the roasted tomatoes. The other issue is that all of the toppings were in separate little piles and not strewn about the salad imparting the flavors all over the wedge. If that salad either had all the toppings dropped all over the salad OR it were brought out in it's wedge form and then tableside chopped up and served like a chopped salad it would have been fantastic! Having to scoop up all the bits from the piles was too hard to get the mixture of ingredients right per forkful. 

My order for dinner was the Tuna Taco Trio appetizer using jicama as the shell instead of crisp shells. The flavor was good (not great because the tuna was a tad fishy as if they had not cut out that really dark, smelly line of the tuna.) It had a nice a sweet and spicy jalapeno syrup and decent (but not special) red cabbage slaw. However the price really was crazy. Where do they think this restaurant is - Beverly Hills? $12 for 3 tiny tacos that equaled 6 relatively small bites of food is ludicrous. It was doll sized tacos, really. 

The braised Asian short ribs were very tasty as well, nice tenderness and a not too salty and nicely rich sauce with garlic, ginger and sesame. The roasted carrots and Asian broccoli (long, thin, stalks like broccoli rapini) were perfectly cooked. It was again on the smaller size for a $27 entree, but not anywhere near as overpriced as the Tuna Taco Trio was.

We will return for lunch, probably on a Thursday in order to double dip on a much more reasonable menu pricing for lunch dishes (and a Korean Crispy Chicken Sandwich which sounds awesome and the 50% off on wines on Thursday. The Happy Hour pricing (3 to 6 pm) seems okay for the drinks but not particularly generous for the food specials.",2017-01-15 00:02:00

Perfect for an intimate evening with your beau, a light lunch with your shopping partner, or a celebratory meal with a group.

Having dined here so often, there are few dishes I haven't tried. These are my favorite that are classics and, unfortunately, some items that have since been removed from the menu (seasonal, making room for new dishes):
CALAMARI FRITTO MISTO: It's no surprise that I love calamari and it's one of my *benchmark* dishes to try at new restaurants. I like their batter, the lightly-battered peperoncini that creates a nice, refreshing note, and their delicious marinara for dipping. I do not like the creamy sauce (not really sure what it is) that is also served.
LOBSTER BISQUE: This is definitely one of the best lobster bisques (or bisques in general) that I have eaten. Nice pieces of lobster and this version is finished with a touch of sherry. Delicious. BTW, the cup is enough; trust me, don't go for the bowl unless that is all you're planning to eat.
POLLO AL FORNO FLATBREAD: Grilled chicken, tomatoes, bacon, feta cheese, green onions with a tomato sauce and creamy parmesan. SERIOUS YUM. The bread is the perfect thickness, creating the right vehicle for this delicious medley of ingredients. Sadly, this is no longer on the Vegas menu!
CHICKEN MILANESE: Romano breaded chicken with herb spaghetti served in my favorite sauce - pomodoro. The breading is crispy without overwhelming the dish and I love their interpretation of the pomodoro.
CHICKEN LIMONE: PIccata-style chicken with a blend of lemon, capers, and white wine - another preparation I really enjoy. The chicken breast is always juicy and the sauce is tangy. They used to serve it with their cripsy potatoes (large chucks of well-fried/sauteed potatoes with herbs and peppers - think ""Potatoes O'Brien""), which I really liked.

There are many salads, appetizers, pastas, flatbread, and bruschetta that they offer, I've eaten, and have enjoyed very much. You can't go wrong! The only dish that was less than satisfactory was the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto; bleh.

This year, they introduced ""The Lighter Side of Tuscany"" with menu items that have reduced calories (I believe they are all below a certain amount, say 600). I tried the INSALATA BRIO: Mixed greens, roasted red peppers, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, grapes and candied pecans tossed with an Italian vinaigrette and balsamic drizzle. Just 345 calories! Well, I removed the gorgonzola and asked for the dressings on the side, so that I could get it as ""Vegan"" as possible. Very delicious!

They have a specials menu that is updated daily, so make sure to check it out because their seasonal cocktails are certainly worthwhile. Some of my favorites that were offered in the past (and I believe one may have become a permanent menu offering) are the STRAWBERRY BASIL LIMONATA (Muddled strawberries and basil in a limonata, so refreshing and yummy) and the APPLE CIDER MARTINI (A little brandy, apple cider, spiced rum, lemon juice, rimmed with cinnamon, YUMMM).

Ever been judged? Felt like 2nd class? Well, this is where you can be. 

Came here with a friend who recently had a baby and was on maternity leave. She had been approved WIC and was already self conscious about using it. I told her it was nothing to be embarrassed about that, the program is there for individuals who needed it and she wasn't abusing the program.

Walking in we went around the store to gather the WIC items and I noticed it was difficult to decipher the WIC items from NON WIC items. I've noticed in other stores while walking thru (such as Albertsons, Food for Less & Smiths) that they have the shelves properly marked so that when I get in line, if a person in front of me has WIC there aren't any problems. I like simple transactions and I'm sure WIC members do too.

So as we walked up to cash register 2, the lady tells us with an attitude ""Oh I dont take WIC"". Confused my friend says, ""Okay well where do I check out then?"" The lady says on 5. I look down the line and notice that lane 5 isn't even open. So, we go to lane 5 and wait, no body came or anything. I tell my friend to hold on i'll get someone to help us. Yes, I'm the one not afraid to speak up. (As my mother in law calls me, a tiger. She never speaks up for herself either). I find a manager and tell her we have WIC items and she says that they aren't doing WIC today. UM WHAAAT?! I thouhgt that was illegal. You cant turn down a WIC member. 

My friend gets annoyed and say meekly, lets just go. I being the eye of the tiger hha say no thats not right. She hushes me up and we leave and go to a different store.

I being upset call for my friend the vons headquarters. Yes, I'm not afraid to stand up for something I believe is wrong. Turns out, I was right. it IS illegal. The man named mark on the phone tells me that the manager should have given us the items for free because it wasn't my friends fault that vons wasnt accepting WIC. 

Hopefully this doesn't happen to other WIC members. If it doesn, stand up for yourselves! Only cause i wont be there to do it for you ;)",2012-03-01 00:54:56

I finally was afforded the opportunity to go and found it to be passable. Mind you, this review obviously pertains only to the South Hills location. Maybe the other(s?) are very different. 

We had lunch and I was able to photograph 4 entrees and personally try the soup (beef and barley) and a salad (seafood Cobb). 

The soup was good but unimaginative. But then again, it's beef and barley. I think it's kind of the point. Actually the beef itself was quite good but there were only a couple pieces in the cup. It reminded me that the one consistent thing I've heard about Atria's is the pot roast nachos. So maybe next time. The beef certainly gave me hope. 

The seafood Cobb salad decent but not great. The dressing I chose (light balsamic) was weird and gloopy although it tasted ok. The seafood was ok, and relatively fairly apportioned. The salad itself was basically an American mix primarily consisting of iceberg. 

Neither of the two dishes were anything to write home about. However, one of my lunch-mates had the meat loaf and he stated unequivocally that it was a 4 out of 5 stars. And I have to admit the plate did look delicious. 

The other two had fish tacos and chicken piccata respectively. The fish tacos were well received although not memorable, while the chicken piccata was decidedly unappealing.

The traffic near Shea and the Loop 101 is killer during the day and after work. However, I finally decided to go at 9pm on a Saturday, when the streets should be dead. Good thing they were, because I had to pull a U turn to get into the shopping center that houses Sweet Republic. 

Outside, there is ample parking and a few patio tables/chairs set up. The inside is well lit with many tables, chairs, and half-booth seating. There are two display cases with freshly made ice cream, an area with delicious toppings, and an ice cream freezer filled with to-go pints. Oh, and there's a game area where you can pull out an old board game and play with your companions. 

When I first entered, I wasn't sure where to start. While there is a board displaying the flavors of the day and the items they offered (sundaes, shakes, coffee, etc) I felt I needed to look at the ice cream to get a better sense of what I wanted to eat. After a few samples, my husband decided on the coconut and lemon in a waffle bowl. I went with a scoop of coffee with toffee brittle, salted caramel sauce, and a freshly toasted hand-made marshmallow on top. It was delicious!

I've had nakama bookmarked on Yelp for close to four years. I've always wanted to go, but never really made the time. Got asked on a date here, and couldn't turn it down. I love sushi.  So, this cant speak to the hibachi tables, but maybe someday it can. 

Arrived at 8pm on Saturday for our reservation, and immediately were seated at a (wobbly) table by the window. We knew we were there for sushi, and we couldn't wait to get to ordering. They have paper sushi menus you can fill out with a little golf pencil and turn in like homework to make your sushi appear. We just kept checking boxes. Haha! So many amazing choices. Thanks to everyone who recommended the Hanalei Roll, it was amazing! 

So the order went a little something like this; Spider Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (much to the disappointment of my date did not contain penguin. KIDDING), Spicy Crab Salad Roll, and the Crunchy Philly Roll. When Leah, our server, brought them out we (and our little wobbly table) were a little overwhelmed. But we made it disappear quite quickly. 

Neither one of us really liked the Penguins Roll. Seemed like it was just..missing something. The spider roll is forever my go to when trying new sushi. It was great. The Hanalei Roll, as previously stated was incredible. Who knew you could flash fry sushi?! The crunchy Philly Roll was about the same. Really good and disappeared quickly. My amazing date really enjoyed the spicy crab salad roll. Leah recommended it, and it was an excellent choice. 

Everything was really great. No complaints on service, Leah made sure we had everything we needed quickly, and kept our water glasses full. Let's turn that music down a little bit, remember, this is Nakama, not Jimmy D's.

Most of my previous review still stands, but I definitely had a wonderful experience which is why I give this 5/5. This is not your typical, fast paced restaurant. The chef really makes each meal from scratch and alone, so yes, your meal in a bigger group or depending what you order may come out first before the others. It's definitely a homey feel. You really need to have patience if you want to eat here. For my experience, I thought the pace was great since we ordered lots!

I made a 7pm reservation for Friday, and when I arrived only a table of 6 were in the restaurant. The server was really kind, and she gave us her recommendations. I had called in advance to ask for 2 orders of the lobster risotto, since I had a few colleagues rave about it recently and thought I just had to try. We also ordered caprese salad, fried calamari, linguine alla vongole - clams in white wine pesto sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the mushroom gnocchi. Yes - this many dishes shared between 4 people. We started with bread, as well as an app on the house (grilled zucchini with squash on top). Everything was delicious. I would prefer to try the grilled calamari next time though. In terms of the lobster risotto, it's not a traditional risotto but made in tomato sauce. If you love lobster, this dish or the lobster pasta is your ideal meal. It comes with a whole lobster! I would also recommend the linguine with clams, and the mushroom risotto was so delicious. Tasted fresh, and full of flavour.

At the end of our meal, the Chef also gave us creme brulee on the house - also the best creme brulee I've ever had. Just the perfect crust, and the dessert itself wasn't overly sweet. I'll definitely be back and hopefully it would take me a year to do so. This place is a gem!",2017-05-13 16:53:39

The foods are not outrageously delicious nor the design, wowing. The staffs are not fantastically friendly, or the menu distinctive in any special way.

It's a Chinese run Restaurant with some Vietnamese dishes.

The Bun (vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring rolls) was average but in no way competitive in taste or price of ""Pho Mi 99"" (in Vaughan). The Pho was bland and definitely could use a few days in the kitchen with the cooks from ""Pho Vietnam"" (Scarborough), and lastly, the Com (rice with grilled chicken and a piece of cha) is plainly alright.

She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had the best attitude.  As far as the food goes, we weren't too impressed.  We ordered the clam chowder, catfish Ruben, and catfish with grits.  The one thing we would come back for is the clam chowder.  The Ruben was ok, but the catfish wasn't really fresh. The best thing was my side...the braised greens were awesome!  And all of this was very over-priced for the quantity...we left hungry.  We would probably only come back for appetizers and drinks with friends.",2016-04-23 12:04:01

Let me start out by saying I've had a lot of sushi in my life. I've lived in Calgary, Toronto, and Vancouver, and THIS place. This specific restaurant is my favourite sushi place in Canada. I've been in Toronto for the last 3 years, studying downtown, and try as I might, I cannot find another place that even comes close to what Kinjo is (and yes, I've been to Wow Sushi up near Yonge and Bloor). Vancouver understandably has better materials, however I weep for the fish which are, more often than not, ruined by the unforgiving hands of amateur chefs. Kinjo is different. The food hits all the right spots on your tongue, and I just don't know how they do it.

I'm not sure if the baby octopus (menu item #75 or #68. It's been years) is still on the menu or taken off the menu, but that was the best thing ever. All of their rolls taste amazing, and after going to Kinjo, I now refuse to eat my sushi with anything other than sweet soy sauce. Seriously, I go to a sushi place, taste their soy sauce, and if it's bad I ask the waiter for sugar, which always gets me this perplexed look, but I just refuse anything else. 

I seriously want to fly back and stay for a month simply to enjoy their sushi. It's just fantastic. I'm not one to seriously exaggerate, but Kinjo is like the freaking Tom Hiddleston of sushi restaurants. It messes with your standards, and anything after it gets compared to this golden standard but none can surpass it.",2013-12-07 18:05:22

I ordered a chicken fried chicken for only $4.50 and $2 extra dollars for some sweet potato fries.  That's price that's hard to beat.  As for the food, it was hot, and tastes good.  The gravy is especially exceptional.  The little lumps of meat mixed with the veges and other ingredients come together perfectly.

There was nothing particularly wrong with them, but there was nothing spectacular either.

I will say that I have rarely seen a restaurant that tries so hard to satisfy its customers.  The wait staff and the manager were very attentive.

Can't tell you why, but we had to. The place was nearly deserted on a mid-week evening around 8:30 or so. As per usual, if you've walked into one Chili's (or Applebee's, O'Charley's, Outback, Olive Garden, etc) you've walked into all of them. Nothing surprising there.

They sat us down and browsed through their menu. Shitty beer selection but I already knew that. So, I ordered water and a Sam Adams Boston Lager for Becky and I to split (since, you know, we still had kids to go back home to).

The waitress was nice and serviceable.

Their menu had the usual fare. We didn't browse a whole lot. They had some special where you get two entrees and an appetizer for $20. Of all the things available from that sub-menu that sounded appealing were the fried shrimp, which I ordered with french fries and cole slaw, and the 6-oz. sirloin, which Becky ordered with a baked potato and steamed broccoli. For the appetizer we chose the corn guacamole.

The appetizer came out pretty quickly and it was a very nice  portion I must say. It did not taste like it came from some reconstituted power and the only true complaint, as far as flavor, was that it needed cilantro. Aside form that, it was ok. Not entire sure why they called it ""corn"" guacamole as there was hardly any to speak of.

The Chips... wow.. those things are a joke and they should be ashamed to call themselves tortilla chips. Doritos have better tortilla chips than this crap. They were paper-thing and broke every time you tried to scoop some guacamole or salsa out. They didn't taste horrible... but you couldn't dip them into anything. The salsa was ok as well. Nice and roasty but no heat.

Then our entrees came. Becky got the better deal out of this fiasco. Her sirloin was nicely cooked medium-rare, her baked potato was pretty standard, topped with the usual goodies and the broccoli was nice and crunchy. Everything on her plate was pretty nice and tasted good.

I, on the other hand, got a miserable 8 shrimp on a mountain of soggy fries. They tasted ok, the shrimp did, but I was not happy with the portion I was given. 10% shrimp 85$ fries and 5% of my plate's real estate went to two ramekins with marinara sauce and sour cream. I barely touched my fries, the marinara was pretty bland and disgusting. It's kinda hard to screw up sour cream from a tub, so that was ok but overall my dinner just sucked. The cole slaw was pretty standard but pretty bland as well.

My plate was a prime example of why we don't go to chain, casual-dining places. They just suck. Definitely won't be going back to ANY Chili's unless I have to.",2012-02-01 20:48:44

The menu offers diverse options for those following a plant-based diet and people who just want to eat healthy food. I've been dining here since they opened, and am slowly making my way through the expansive menu. They are open for lunch and dinner every day, and lunch specials on weekdays. 

My favorite dish is the fresh ginger stir fry. I've had it with mock chicken and tofu, but want to try the mock beef next time I visit. Other items I've tried and liked: dumpling curry (which is listed on their online menu as ""dumping"" curry - fix that!), green curry, house fried rice, veggie rolls, pot stickers, praluck, onion and black pepper stir fry, jungle noodle and soy chicken wrap. All are great! I'm surprised that they don't have a red curry, given they are a Thai restaurant. Their online menu lists one of my Thai favorites - Tom Kha Kai (Thai coconut soup) but it's not on their printed menu so I haven't tried it yet but want to if it's available. The one item that everyone loves - orange soy chicken - is great, but it doesn't come with veggies so I get a bit bored just eating chicken chunks. They offer different levels of spice for stir fries and curries, but don't tend to over spice. Ordering ""medium"" gives you a hint of flavor, but is not overpoweringly spicy. The veggies are fresh and crispy. 

The main downside of Vegan House is that they don't staff appropriately. We were there on a Saturday night when there were several events happening downtown, a big vegetarian festival in Scottsdale that attracted vegan tourists, and a convention. They only had one waiter, who was literally running from table to table. We saw some people wait for awhile and leave without having been acknowledged, and I think I may have seen someone dodge their check because they were tired of waiting. We were served promptly and pleasantly (in part because we knew what we wanted and didn't ask questions like most tables around us did), but it was stressful watching him stress out!

Came here primarily for the ramen and the fact that they serve Yakitori. Arrived around dinner time to a full house, patio and interior but found it's business due to the lack of staff. Took about 5-10 minutes before actually being seated. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and a Gyu Tan skewer (Beef Tongue). 

The ramen took a bit to come out, but I was pleased. It definitely is a large portion, noodles eggy but on the thinner side (think Chinese egg noodles) and cooked a tad bit over. The broth itself was rich, not too fatty but very opaque and had an interesting smoky flavor to it. Smoky broth was a first and I really enjoyed it, it definitely gave the ramen richness and umpf! You get two thick, but tender and fatty pieces of Char shu, a marinated half boiled egg which is probably the best ramen egg I've had here in Arizona along with typical toppings such as green onions, a tiny bit of bamboo shoots and a small pieces of seaweed. Definitely a better ramen than that you can find here, though I wish they had some Chili Powder or crushed garlic on the side to add. 

The Gyu Tan skewer was kind of sad. Tiny pieces of beef tongue on two skewers, though tender and flavorful I felt that a little green onions or splash of lemon would've elevated the skewer. It was also $5, yikes!

Service is pretty slow, to the point that a few people left while waiting to be seated. From waiting to be seated, getting our order in and actually getting our food took an hour. Also when our food did arrive we didn't get any utensils or napkins. Price point is decent for ramen and typical, skewers are overpriced and lacking. Typically, skewers should be around $2 and upwards only for seafood and seasonal market type items. 

*Take aways: good, solid bowl of ramen worthy of 4 stars*

All the items that are in this store started at nordstroms then went to nordstroms rack then found themselves on the messy racks here. Majority of the items are missing buttons, have broken zippers, large stains or clearly worn then returned.

The rules posted on the wall are there for your protection... Yes I'm not joking. Crazy women in need of a good bargain can be extremely scary!

But the first key to success is knowing you have a problem right?.... Oooooh look at that amazing Chole handbag over there!! 


The trick to this place is make friends with someone who works here and have them sneak you the details on when they get their shipments. Yeah yeah I know that's cheating but come on I need more shoes... And more clothes... And we'll I could also use a new handbag... And sunglasses. 

Don't be surprised if you go before they open and find a crowd outside waiting for the doors to open.

The drinks are awesome -- I had an updated Sazerac that just sang on my palate.  The service is a joy, just like Beckett's Table.  But the menu is not quite as tightly controlled as at Chef Justin's earlier place;  while my Duck Confit rocked, and their Brioche Parker House Rolls are transcendent, my companion's Pork Loin was overcooked to the point of dreadful, shoe leather quality dryness..  The dessert selections are rather more interesting at Beckett's Table as well.  Restaurants can all have off menu choices or line cook mistakes, so I'm not going to give SR a thumbs down.

I usually arrive on Sunday nights. The music is the best that I have experienced, as it is actually mixed, creative and ""club"" music, not simply Top 40 hip-hop with a DJ using beatmatching software. (I love to dance to hip-hop when it is done right, but when I show up at a club and 75% of the songs feature the word ""SHAWTY"", it is time for me to leave.) Plus, if you want hip-hop, you can slide downstairs to the Playboy club; they do a decent job with hip-hop, but I find the decor disappointing. There is no reason that Playboy needed to try to fit into an Ed Hardy world of badness. But, I digress, so at Moon, the music is right, which means the dancing is right, and generally on Sunday nights it is not too crowded. I hate crowds, as I actually like to move on the dance floor, not just bounce up and down. The staff is always pleasant and professional. The view is amazing. The roof is a nice spectacle.

This is a great ""occasion"" restaurant that would be perfect for a date, anniversary dinner, or birthday dinner....I say ""occasion"" because it's got that price point that's just a step above normal/everyday restaurant, but not quite fine dining prices.  I wrestled with the prices all night because the entrees I think are fairly priced, but some of the other items like drinks and desserts, are insanely over priced.

DECOR: The decor is really simple and elegant.  This place so reminds me of the places I love in Hillcrest in San Diego.  It's got a ""down home farm chic"" feel to it.

DRINKS:  All 5 of us in our party got the Mosc-ito because we love us some ginger beer.  This drink is a cross between a Moscow Mule and a Mojito.  Very good, a bit sweet.  At $12, it is a pretty expensive cocktail.

FOOD: I got the turkey bolognese ($18) and enjoyed it immensely.  Really flavorful, a perfect portion so you weren't carb stuffed, and neat looking noodles.  Two of my friends got the Brick chicken with mac and cheese ($22), and they both ate every bite.  My other two friends shared a salad and a flatbread pizza.  The salad was tiny for the $9 price tag.

DESSERT: This gets its own section because the desserts here are amazing.  A little apple pie that comes in a paper bag, bread pudding, and the OH MY GOD salted caramel chocolate ice cream.  Here's my beef:  all the desserts are $9.  For a freshly baked to order pie - yes, fair.  For a bowl of homemade bread pudding - yes, fair.  But for 3 scoops of ice cream???? No, not fair.  You're telling me EACH SCOOP is $3???  It made me sad because the salted caramel chocolate ice cream was delicious, but I will probably never get it again because I refuse to spend $9 on ice cream.

A guy server/host came and greeted us but there was already a table waiting so we sat down. As we sat down we asked for a pot of tea and the server asked us how many cups because the female server (don't know her name) didn't explain well about the pricing of the tea. Had to clarify with a different server and apparently the tea is unlimited but they charge $2.00 per cup... that is ridiculous and it's the first time ever I've encountered a restaurant doing that. 

Moving on, I ask the female server for some menus and she walked away without acknowledging that we've sat there for almost 10 minutes without menus! I saw some random menus laying on the counter and just went for it myself. She came back with some water and I had to ask if they charge for water because in some restaurants they charge for filter water... she then told me ""well if you want me to charge then I'll charge it."" Excuse me but I was asking a serious question and all she did was walked away before I can say anything. At this point I'm really piss at this girl, she's rude and obnoxious. We had to get her attention several times to take our order and when she does she only asked two out the nine people that was there what we wanted to eat.. are you even serious because she can't even perform basic etiquette of being server... 

Prices are freaking ridiculous here. Seriously, almost 13$ for a bowl of Pho... $4.95 for two rolls of spring rolls that are smaller than usual. Egg rolls tasted like it was refried several times, oven baked catfish was not marinated well at all, the sauce that came with the fish (mam nem) was so inconsistent with one being so bland and the other being very salty. 

She never checked on our table to see if we needed anything and it's so unethical to treat all the other tables so nice and professional but when it comes to our table she gave the worst attitude and never acknowledged us when we call her. Asked for her name and she said ""why do you need to know my name"" and pointed at the receipt book then walks away! I've seriously gave up at this point as I was there for a birthday dinner so I didn't want to cause any scene. 

I just think that the service here are very rude and it's unethical to be treating every table with respect and professionalism but my party had to worst night with her. We didn't come here for free food! We pay for our food and also gave her a 15% gratuity and that's how she treated us.

We were there at opening today and the ground by all the chairs near the wave pool? FILTHY!! Huge chunk of lord knows what right by the seats we found in the shade, crud everywhere and the lounge chairs are covered in black marks, stains, dirt, and random grossness! Do they even clean this place? Anyway, that is my huge rant for the day and I will move on to other points.

It's my third year here and again I cannot go over 2 stars for the place. We obviously keep going every year, and I do think for the Gold Pass it is a decent value if you go frequently. They are always fairly busy so I don't think they are hard up for customers. I think the only way it is worth it at all though, is to get a season pass, and go for a couple hours once a week. If you go right when they open (weekdays), you can easily get seats in the shade, ride every slide the first hour, spend the second hour between lazy river and wave pool, then head out before it gets too crazy. That seems to work well for us since we are just down the block but maybe not practical for people who live farther out?

As far as employees, it is a real 50/50 type situation. They are all pretty much kids it seems, and either very friendly, or will barely look at you and moodily stare into space. Typical teens I guess. I will say once we got a cabana, and there was a mix up so it took a while, and everyone was really nice from the office people, to the cabana hostess, so if you spring for that, the customer service is very good. 

The food is ok, I actually like the waffle fries most days and you do get a discount with a Gold Pass, so that helps. The waits can be crazy long during the normal lunch time though so be prepared or eat early or late. The lazy river is fun, but again DIRTY! Filled with all sorts of bugs and leaves and other things?!? Now I realize it's outside, but it is much dirtier than other parks I have been to, so I know there must be some way of keeping it cleaner that they are not doing over here. Wave Pool is fun, and big, which is nice. 

Also, I have to say I am hugely disappointed that they made the one slide a game slide you have to pay for. It is free with Gold Pass, but my kids have Silver and that was my little ones favorite slide and now you have to pay money to ride it. They billed it as this huge ""NEW FUN SLIDE!"" but they just used an old slide, so not only did they not build a new slide, they made one they already had in their park cost money. Just screams MONEY HUNGRY to me :-(

Anyway, I think that is kind of the basics of this place. We all go because there really isn't much else to do with your kids in Vegas, and I do think that in some ways WetNWild does try to make things better or listen to their customers (for instance it does seem like there is more shade this year), but with their constant adding new things that just cost more money (the slide, the picture bracelet, the many (empty!) daybeds), and not even being able to maintain a clean environment...I am just not impressed.",2015-07-04 04:05:59

I've tried many of the items on their menu over the past 15 years that I have been going there. The chicken breast sandwich is probably the best anywhere and has a delicious teriyaki marinade on a large toasted bun. I also love their vegetables, my favorites being the garlic new potatoes and the squash casserole. The Jacko Pork on rice is another uniquely tasting dish and the BBQ meatloaf (Friday special) is another top pick for me.

My 2 favorite things on the menu are, strangely enough, the reason for my 3 star rating, each for the same reason. I will explain. I'll start with the incredibly delicious Chicken Pot Pie, a Wednesday special. Next would be the Black bean and rice chicken con queso, or the same thing without the black beans. Here's the problem. Nine times out of ten, not an exaggeration, I get bones in these supposedly ""boneless"" (as advertised) dishes. There is nothing more aggravating than to be chomping on your food and biting into a bone or other inedible chicken parts. It ruins the entire experience because now, I have to sift through every remaining bite before putting it in my mouth. And it happened yet again this week with the chicken con queso. A one inch bone, enough to make you bleed if you bite into it wrong. 

So, am I just unlucky or is it just a coincidence? Apparently not. While discussing the chicken pot pie with a few co-workers a while back, each admitted they also had gotten bones, even an entire wishbone in one persons pot pie. This is inexcusable. 

I think from here on out I will stick to the veggie plate or chicken breast sandwich. I would without a doubt give a 5 star rating if not for the bone fragments.",2016-05-07 08:20:41

The last pizza I ordered was the potato pizza and I honestly ate two slices to be polite to my date as I really did not like even the first bite. The rosemary was totally overpowering and the potatoes didn't taste cooked all the way through. I'm not a fan of the crust or lack of sauce. It's more like a flatbread. Just a little misleading.

Only one of us in the party had dined here previously, and she was not too impressed at that time (but wanted to give them a second chance).

The restaurant interior was low key but modern, with one of the walls proudly displaying part of their wine collection and another wall decorated with framed fine wine labels.  Pretty classy impression on a moderate interior decorating budget.

The service was good. I was parched but my glass of water was refilled frequently without having to ask the wait staff to do. After looking over the menu for what felt like 1/4 of eternity, we finally picked out three items to try for our dinner.

My favorite is probably the Pad Hed - Shitake and Shimeji Mushroom Stir Fried with Brussels Sprouts and Lotus Root. Excellent!  And it was the first item to disappeared from our table.

We also tried the Panang Curry - Slow cook Beef in Panang Curry.  The beef was tender and has good flavor. Overall, a decent dish but nothing that will screams ""You must tell everyone to order this!"".

Last but not least, Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) - Flat Rice Noodles, Bird Eye Chili, Garlic and Basil and Ground Pork.  Decent but still wish the portion was larger.  

Taste: (3.5/5)  I think the key is finding their better menu items.

Price/Value:  (3/5)  Average price, but portion on the smaller side.

If it's your first time visiting, get the one minute tutorial about pricing from the greeter. One woman was irked that she didn't get the schpeal, but there were like four guys greeting people when we arrived. Basically, anything under $20 is not negotiable. Everything is organized well enough, but you are still pleasantly surprised to stumble across things. I found a console that was way overpriced at $100, negotiated, and got a pretty high counter. So I walked away. No big deal. They tell you to expect 10 minutes, but I only waited two. I came across some great vintage items for ridiculously good prices--even before negotiating. 

The staff is outgoing and friendly. The merch is clean. The options here are endless. I took my husband, who hates these outings, and he got lost in the tool aisle and was impressed by what the store had to offer. 

I took one star off because the air wasn't on. IDK if that is how it's going to be, but as it is almost June and the store is massive (thus needing air circulation), the air needed to be on. The people who worked there had a great sense of humor about it, though.

One of the group frequently visits another Asian Legend  location and has always raved about the food. Based on her ravings about the place, we decided to give it a go on a Friday night.
As our friend was here before, she wrote down our selections and passed it to the waiter. I don't know if this is par for the course here, but I noticed small pads of paper on most tables and a pencil as well. Perhaps it's done this way to avoid confusion, as the menu is fairly large. Anyways...it worked and we received all the items ordered. 
We ordered far too many dishes to comment on them all, so I'll list some of the hits and misses
* Steam Soup filled Dumplings with Ground Pork - the person who recommended this place said this is one of her favorite dishes at Asian Legend, so she loved it. Being a ""newbie"", I found it interesting. Not sure I would order it again, as it was a bit salty for my liking, but it's a neat combination of items.
* rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef - the onion flavor is fairly light. I found it to be a bit on the gummy side (I had an end piece)  but all my dining companions loved this dish. 
* Vegetarian  Spring Rolls - ugh. Not very good unfortunately. I've purchased frozen ones better than what we were served. 
* General Tao Chicken - had a nice heat to it, generous portion size. Very good.
* Stir Fried Spicy Shredded Beef - complex flavours which were completed overwhelmed by far TOO much salt. Generous portion size. 
* Fried Sliced Noodles with Sliced Beef - pretty flavorless 
* Sautéed Baby Bok Choi with Garlic - the hit it of the meal. Cooked perfectly with an intoxicating aroma of garlic. Perhaps the best I've ever had at a restaurant.

Our male waiter was very good. When we saw a dish on someone else's table we asked what it was and asked for it. He came back laughing a minute later to inform us we had included that item in our original order. He was attentive and friendly. 

So, based on some of what were ordered, a few dishes were definitely misses, some were fantastic. I'll most likely visit again just to sample more items.",2015-06-21 12:36:58

I love a good bowl of ramen! Since coming back from a trip to Japan a few years ago, I'm constantly on the hunt for the perfect bowl. I think I've found that here at Konjiki. I was so excited when I saw this chain arriving in Canada and had to get in line to understand the hype.

When the restaurant first opened, there were lineups out the door every night, now it's definitely easier to get a spot. I've come a few times now and I've never been disappointed. 

The restaurant is really nice inside, high ceilings and bar seating in the middle makes it look modern and cool, yet it's still comfortable and welcoming. Service is always good, water refills are regular and frequent which is important when eating salty ramen, and food is always brought out quickly. We're usually in and out of the restaurant within an hour, sometimes even half an hour depending on how hungry we are! 

Now for the food, With regards to the ramen, i've only ever gone with the shoyu clam broth ramen. I was worried the first time I tried it that it would have a strong seafood or clam flavor but it adds a wonderful depth to the flavor, not fishy at all. The broth is amazingly complex, there's hint of the clam, the truffle, the pork and chicken flavors all meld together into something amazing and the toppings work perfectly to add texture and pops of flavor that are different in every bite. I like to add an egg which is perfectly soft boiled and makes a perfect gooey bite. The sous vide chasu is soft and luscious, yet somehow light. This is the perfect bowl of ramen, really. It's different yet it hits the spot when I'm craving ramen, in fact, I don't think I can go back to other places, it's that good. I've also tried the karaage and it was good but not any better than I've had elsewhere! Definitely worth a try if you're feeling extra hungry!

Price point is average, maybe $1-2 higher than the average bowl of ramen. It's worth it though, I feel like it's a higher end bowl of ramen. I do wish the egg would come with it though, I feel like most ramen places include an egg but I have to pay $1.50 to add it. Again it's a worthwhile expense but it does start to get pricey when you start adding a bunch of things. It's not necessary but it's delicious! 

Overall, get here fast, it's perfect. I'd love to try the other ramen options even though I keep going back for the same one, they even have a lobster ramen on Wednesday's that I'd love to try but I'm not sure I'd want to pay $30 for a bowl of ramen! Try it, you'll be hooked!!",2018-09-25 16:46:33

Totally overwhelming for someone as ignorant as I, but I have been back twice now - here are my 5 star reasons:

1. Mom's Chicken, as EVERYONE else here has said. Mr. Rosie S. was very impressed! And he doesn't even LIKE fried chicken.

2. Sushi!!! Yummers! This is the best place in the area to grab ready-to-go sushi! Yes, I know sushi is Japanese. 

3. NOOOOOOOODLES. Just wow! The selection here is one of the best in the GTA, I think! Just amazing. You could become the next Ramen Rater with JUST the supply at this location. Huge selection.

4. Clean, bright, great signage. Everyone is really, really nice!

5. THE EXPERIENCE! I feel like I have travelled across the world when I step in the doors here - I just love it. Bonus = everyone is friendly and speaks at least some English!

FLlKsZ-N3udStxVkX9XFEA,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,nfdNvM0HFCDmnJ5eHMnuNg,3,6,9,3,"You'd think I'd have gone to Miracle Mile already, considering how close I've lived to this joint for the past 18 months, but given I work nowhere near it so that I could easily drop by for lunch, and that it never seems open when I drive by it at night, my chances to eat here were slim to none. 

I thought Miracle Mile was closed on the weekends, and I was going to try out the Kokopelli taqueria a few doors down instead, but as I was walking towards the latter, I saw that Miracle Mile had its tables and umbrellas out, and so I walked towards it.

Open! Score!

I walked in, and was taken aback by how mf'ing HUGE this place is. I'm serious. It's like airport hangar size. OK, maybe half the size of the Best Buy around the corner, but still.

Now comes the intimidating part - the New York Jewish deli-cafeteria-style ordering bit. It seemed like everyone who was in line knew what they wanted before they even got to the front. No stalling. No indecisiveness. It was all ""pastrami on rye with two latkes and a pickle"" and move on. Total Soup Nazi style. Any delay and you got both the people behind you and the guy behind the counter giving you the evil eye. Man, it's Sunday! What's everyone's hurry? Day of rest, people!

So I got to the front, and not wanting to waste one second, ordered the roast beef on kaiser roll. ""Hot roast beef, right?"" said the guy. I wanted cold, but said yes anyway. Did I even want roast beef? Whatever. Sandwich, fries, and pickle came to about $8.25 with tax, which seemed a little high to me - especially since all that was in the sandwich was the meat and one small dinky slice of swiss cheese. 

I then took my tray, sat down, and picked up my sandwich.

Or more accurately, I tried to pick it up.

The bottom half of the kaiser roll had completely disintegrated thanks to the juices of the roast beef, and all the contents just fell through my fingers and onto the plate. Okay, so it was now a fork and knife meal. I'd have thought for $8.25 the bread would last at least a couple more minutes. My fries were lukewarm and a little limp & soggy, which was a downer. I mean, if I'm going to partake in ingesting solid cholesterol and then feeling bad about it afterwards, damn at least those fries better be hot and crispy and worth it. 

In any case,  I sat around and ate my meal while lazily reading the New Times. Regardless of the sandwich malfunction and the sad fries (wah wah), it's still Sunday and I'm still going to read something, like the ""Ask A Mexican"" column on page 5 or wherever it is.

I'd say the meat of my sandwich was pretty decent (albeit sprawled on my plate and not in my hands), but beyond the kaiser roll being flimsy, it wasn't a great roll taste-wise. I was expecting a lot better, for some reason. But maybe it was because I chose my meal in a slight panic that I didn't order correctly. Who knows. There is a lot offered in terms of both hot and cold sandwiches, plus many other dishes (mac n' cheese, chicken salad, etc.), and of course, latkes. How many places do you know have latkes ready to eat? In Phoenix, anyway? But my experience here was lacking a bit, which is a bum deal, because I really wanted to like it and have it become one of my weekend institutions as well.

Miracle Mile apparently is a very popular daytime destination as it's packed to the gills during weekday lunch hour (which is crazy for me to picture every table in this humongous place being occupied). Whether I'll be back again is a good question, but at least I know in the future that my brain needs to be switched to ""on"" as soon as I step my foot in. Nothing like Grandma Ethel sighing loudly and impatiently behind you while you debate the merits of rye or sourdough in your head.

Vicentina's came as a recommendation from my wife who used to work in the same area and I have to say that it's a pretty good option.

They get very busy at lunch so I STRONGLY suggest that you order online before heading over to pick up your sandwich. They have a +$3.99 optoin for double meat and I have to say that the one time I chose this option, I was overwhelmed! That is saying a lot because I'm a big eater!

I've been slowly making my way through the menu of options and I have to say that the Porchetta has been the best so far. The veal is completely underwhelming and while the steak is good, the slices are large and chewy to a point that you are pulling two or three mouthfuls of meat with each bite and having to manage it on your plate afterward.

I ADORE The Kitchen!  So much so, I ended up visiting three times in one week :)  [Unfortunately, I only have photos from the first two visits, as I had misplaced my SD card after the third].  Wow, where do I start?  The front of the venue reminds me of an AJ's Fine Foods, or a (very) mini-Whole Foods: there's the bread aisle to your right as you walk in, cash registers to your left, and straight ahead is the cold food section where you may find deli side items (along w/ roasted veggies and crisp asparagus spears), as well as prepared paninis, which they'll grill for you, if you want.  Try the white cheddar w/ truffled butter on sourdough- to die for!  I get it EVERY time, no matter what else may strike my fancy during my stay here (and I'm here for HOURS, no exaggeration).  Beside and behind this deli counter are cases of pastries and pies, charcuterie products, and cheese!  There is also a soup kiosk, as well as a sandwich station.  There is a self-serve dining section in this room, w/ a couch, or two, and coffee table, as well as bar-height tables and chairs, and a couple of electric sockets to plug into while you utilize free wi-fi!  While the sandwich maker will happily oblige you in slicing a loaf of bread you picked up from the many shelves and even toast a few slices for you to have w/ the half-pound of Tuscan chicken salad you sampled first at the deli counter, make no mistake in thinking you'll be able to flag someone down as you dine at the self-service area.  Once you pay for your items, you're on your own.

If it's effusive service you want, head over to the back of the restaurant where you'll find a wine bar to your left, a lovely dining area in the middle, and a bar counter to the right.  There's even patio dining in the back, but it was too cold to even consider that option then.  You'll find live music between 6p and 9p on Friday nights.  The times I spent there, the group Slave to the Groove played.  One of the two musicians used to be a chef :)  In between the sections of self- and full-service, you'll find a coffee bar, featuring Portland Roasting Company coffee, where you may also purchase pastries, such as muffins, cookies, and scones, and to its right, you will find the pizza/hot grill station, where pizzaiolos/cooks busily prepare your pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, or even roast prime rib while you wait!  (The lay-out of TK is, to me, nicely done.  I wish my home could feel like this!  Oh, and did I mention there is free wi-fi??  Not hard to imagine that I've spent hours here, now, is it?)

Before I go on and on, let me just list a few items I really enjoyed: 

1. White cheddar panini w/ truffled butter, $4 (don't forget to have it pressed!).  Perfect w/ that $5 glass of wine during happy hour.
2. Prosciutto, goat cheese, fig, and arugula bruschetta w/ aged balsamic vinaigrette- a great deal on their happy hour menu!
3. Apple crumble w/ vanilla-bean ice cream!

p.s.  Their caffe latte is superb!  I have it w/out sugar, so that I can justify splurging on a cookie (or two!)- the white chocolate macadamia nut or the oatmeal-raisin pairs up well.  (I'd pass on the chocolate chip cookie- the chips used aren't of great quality, IMHO).   

Whether you're here for lunch, happy hour, coffee break, or dinner, you'll find The Kitchen a worthwhile choice.  (Did I mention they also serve breakfast?  Menu looks divine; I haven't been, but if someone sets up a breakfast UYE here, I'll try my best to attend!)",2010-03-13 00:14:56

The set menu included choices of:
- scallop sashimi or marinated trout
- wine poached egg with beet, bacon, grape salad or beef tartare
- chocolate cake & frothed caramel ""earthquake"" with coffee ice cream or caramel profiteroles with vanilla ice cream

Though not overly remarkable visually, all the dishes were well presented.

Unfortunately the scallops weren't well cleaned before plating and contained bits of sand/shell which provided an enamel-grinding crunch.  Overall the plainness of the undressed scallops could've used a little boost of fleur de sel & pepper at the least.

The wine-poached egg with salad was a curious dish.  The egg, besides its color, wasn't remarkable.  It didn't take on a particularly interesting flavor from its bath in vinho tinto, but the salad nest around it was quite good in all respects.

The seared beef tartare on the other hand, was pretty damn spiffy.  The searing added a steak-like flavor to what I normally find a pretty plain-jane raw beef, texture-focused dish.  Marinated mushrooms tossed into the mix bumped up the umami quotient to tastebud teasing levels and the dense, crunchy crouton-like bits tossed in provided a texture contrast to the normal meat-mush-a-thon.

The desserts were both good. The chocolate cake / frothed, caramel brittle looked like an 8.8 on the Richter scale of dulce-de-cocoa upheaval (check out the photos).  Profiterole cream burgers, with a heavy drizzle of bittersweet caramel rounded out the browned sugar one-two punch.

The noise level is on the high-end at full swing.  For a quiet conversation, I'd recommend Birks Café, with its open mezzanine/sound-escape setup.

The sandy scallop affair was likely a one-off issue and the red-wine egg bath was likely created for the MTL-à-Table menu, so overall this a 3.5 star rating.

Service was TERRIBLE and there were hardly any diners in the place.  It was far from crowded.  We asked our server for more water and a few lemons, and he forgot both, even after we reminded him.  We had to help ourselves from the lemons at the bar- LAME.  Then he made some comment like, ""I could have brought those to your table, you know,"" full of attitude.  

When we finally got our bills (he also had major 'tude with giving us individual tabs), he had given us all of our change in quarters.  Some of us had more change than necessary and some of us were short-changed.  NONE of us had the correct change.  At this point I lost it and proceeded to go pretty much ape sh*t on our 45 year old server with a comb-over.  ""Excuse me, look- all of our change is completely um, how do i say this, NOT RIGHT. AT ALL.""  He gives me a blank stare and then shrugs it off: ""Sorry, we don't have any other coins except quarters here.  We give change in quarters."" Then he smiles sweetly and says, ""Would you like to speak to the manager, miss?""  the rest is pretty ugly from there.

Now, let me clear that i am not expecting the world's greatest meal OR service from America the restaurant inside a Vegas casino.  However, I do expect to get what i pay for and that includes getting the correct change back, NOT IN JUST QUARTERS.

Have been many times to Melting Pot's here and out of state and its consistently great.  Last night we went for Ladies Night Out, they offer all 4 courses for $35 and $5 of that goes to Susan G. Komen Foundation.  They do this a few times throughout the year and other times they benefit St. Jude's Children's Hospital.  A chance to eat well and contribute to a good cause?  Sign me up!!

There was 3 of us and in the past they would put us at a table w/2 burners, but not this time.  In the end we really didn't need different cheese/chocolates anyway.  

We started with the cheese they are offering on the Big Night Out, it was some sort of french mixture with brie, gruyere, swiss, bacon, truffles, chives and wine.  It was delish!!  Followed that up w/house salads, I love their house dressing.  Then we had our entree.  If I go on a non-charity type night I never order the entree, I don't think its that good and I would prefer tp fill up on the other stuff, but it was included so we ate it.  It included, 3 shrimp, 3 pieces of chick, 3 pieces of steak, 2 ravioli and a bowl of potatos, mushrooms and broccoli to throw in the pot, and 6 different sauces to try.  

Last but definitely not least was the chocolate.  We went with the cookies & cream, it was dark chocolate with toasted marshmallow and oreo cookie pieces.  Sounds awful right?  It comes with strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice krispy treats, and different coated marshmallows.  My oldest sister and I were soo full at this point but we couldn't make ourselves stop dipping all the yummy treats into that warm chocolate, our younger sister kept making fun of our gluttonous ways, but I didn't care. 

Melting Pot is not the type of place you go weekly or monthly because I really feel like you need to be in the mood for the whole experience and for the almost painfully full feeling you will most definitely have when you leave.  But its great for special occasions or to help out a good cause.",2010-10-07 13:35:12

I remember the Taiwanese style noodle restaurants in Vancouver - the crepes / wraps were crispy and piping hot, lots of flavour and loaded with meat. The beef brisket bowls of soup were flavourful and the meat was tender to the touch. Pa pa Chang's, in my opinion is moving in the right direction... I blame myself for seeting such high expectations.

People weren't kidding when they said this place was small.... a mere 8 tables tops, with a few that allows for communal seating. Luckily, I was surprised that on a Thursday night at 6, the place was empty except for another mother with her daughter.

I looked at the pretty pictures as my bff was excited about order tako yaki and all the other fried goodness that I was sure would be tasty. I was eying the crepe, and reminiscing about my Vancouver adventures. We felt like the beef noodle soup was a must order and went with that as well, along with a plate of fried tofu.

Food came out quick and I'm not sure if that's a a good sign. The crepe was first to come - we chose to have the meat floss filling. At first look, maybe I ordered the wrong thing... the crepe was not crispy at all, but I was open to new things. At first bite... the taste seemed off as the texture was soft and soggy like, and I was not expecting to be having mayonnaise in this... totally off pudding. There were shreds of lettuce and as often as this sounds... it felt like an Asian style Big Mac... and I'm not saying this in a good way..... I think what I was thinking of was the flatbread all along.

The other items came out and they were much better. I'm never sure about takoyaki because I feel like there is too much batter, but this was very tasty and well proportioned. The fried tofu was not over battered and lighted crisped with a good portion of tofu on the inside. Meanwhile, the beef noodle soup was okay... but could have been better. The beef was not super tender like I would have hoped which I believe is the main seller of the dish.

Overall the entire meal was okay. I have other noodle places I need to try before coming back,",2013-11-14 20:47:57

NOPE...First of all let me be very transparent. #1 You are 100% we NEVER met in person but we did talk on the phone several times. I don't know you, but I did hire you based on your reviews. You were going to charge me $75.00 we disussed if i should send my PA with check or cash or if you could bill over the phone...and YOU not only set an appt, but YOU asked me to email you the times, address, the contact info, and my credit card info. I sent you that email and although I refused to include my CC number in it. Thats not very secure is it??? I viewed it as an oversite. Instead I asked you to have your office call me to take payment and YOU called me back to get that info. Why would I do that if it were FREE????? #2 I haven't  yelled or acted unprofessionally towards you YET ( just wait its coming),  but this is MUCH more than I can say for you, or whomever your representatives are, not withstanding perhaps a nice lady that I think worked in your office that I so so recall,  #3 It wasn't a house sitter it was a personal assistant she was a lil frusterated and may have taken a tone, and I was clear that I understood that, hell I noted it in my review. #4 now that I am done being professional and I have blocked you from making charges on my credit card I have one thing to say....  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_orP5JHZWE . Photos don't lie... I have emails, call logs, and an email from you confirming... NOW I am posting photos because you claim I never hired you that it was free? Well heck why would anyone complain about FREE? Then again why would you, a business take the time to get my credit card info if it was FREE???  Why did I end up hiring the home inspection company $65.00 to do a termite inspection because you were going to give me one for FREE???? Call me out again... because in the words of Mr T. ""I pity the fool"" oh and PS this is why people believe my reviews...

Lets get to the food. As far as burger establishments once again i will say that when you charge $20 a burger it better be awesome. I will say that Im a little upset that i spent $70 for 2 burgers and 2 beverages and that was including tip. But spending time with my cousin who was staying here at the cosmo made it worth it.

Fun-Ghi Burger (3/5)- By itself it would have probably been too much but i added a fried egg and it made the powerful truffle flavor balance out. without the egg i wouldnt have enjoyed the burger as much but i did like it. 

Turkey Burger (4/5)- My wife had this and she really enjoyed it and said it was well put together.I dont have anything specific to say about it because i didnt try it.

The only way we'll be back is if we go with friends or family it is a great place to socialize and very laidback. Service was great our server really took care of us and for i will be back to enjoy some more burgers. Looking forward to trying the Rising Sun.

I went with the Chili & Cheese Omelet ($7): Cheddar Jack Cheese, Green and Red Bell Peppers, Green and Red Onions, and Mama's Chili. The chili was a bit sweet and watery in consistency...I'd order something else next time around.  I also noticed the eggs weren't as ""fluffy"" as I am used to, comparing it to other omelet specific spots in town.

Since their chili is relatively popular, I either missed it on a good day, or my taste buds prefer thicker-hearty chilis with a hint of spice. This was a bit sweet, boring and not for me.

I think they do this on purpose to get you full so you don't order more sushi.  Tip:  Order as much sushi as you think you can eat and wait for all of it to arrive before starting to eat.  It worked for me!  The hubby wasn't as fortunate and spent a lot of time waiting for his sushi to arrive.  The kids just ordered from the regular menu and finished their food long before us.

It's open air with outdoor seating, and the service was great.   Our waitress knew the menu inside and out, which was great, since the entire menu looked incredible.  We started with the wings, which were a delish (not spicy) twist on an Asian/sweet wing.  I ordered the beer braised short ribs with cheesy grits, while my BF got the torta.  We both agreed that my meal was the best, and although some of my meat was all fat, the flavor was fantastic.

I love the decor and ambiance. Service was just ok as my husband had to chase down our server to pay. I had asked for a more private area since I had the baby with us and just in case she decided to scream her head off we wouldn't be the center of attention. 

We started of with the New England Fry.  Yummy seafood with just the right amount of crispy and not overcooked.  I decided to go for the Banana Foster French Toast in hopes that it wasn't too sweet. My husband got the all popular Biloxi chicken sandwich. My French toast was amazing...the cornflake crust and the thick bread with caramelized bananas soooooo good.  My tummy rumbles just thinking about it. It definitely was just the right amount of sweetness which my palate isn't too sweet. I was super excited to try the Biloxi buttermilk chicken sandwich as many people have compared it to the famous chick fil a chicken sandwiches but I was a bit disappointed. I wasn't in love with the sandwich and I didn't think it was OMG good. It was decent but I wouldn't order it again. Maybe it was just an off day but in any case I wasn't impressed. 

Overall service was ok for a Sunday during brunch. They weren't packed or anything like that.  This place is pricey for brunch but I would like to come back for dinner and try that.

I was getting hangry anyways :p we opted to go for Moxie's as the bf has been craving it for some time. We were greeting at the door and offered the lounge. We sat ourselves and the booth I picked unfortunately had quite a bit of crumbs on the seat.

The boyfriend had heard through word of mouth that the moxie's chicken enchilada was really good. Therefore, that was our selection for the day (we got some dry ribs as well). Our server was super attentive and filled our drinks quite quickly throughout the meal. The wait for the enchilada was quite long, a good 25 minutes; the food came warm at least. 

I found the dry ribs to be under seasoned and tasted heavily of oil. No real complaints or complements for their chicken enchiladas either. They had plated chips with the enchiladas, so we had something to scoop up all the left over sauce and cheese on the plate.

I personally don't mind eating in the lounge, but the bartender throughout our whole meal spent a majority of his time chatting with two girls at the bar and actively eating from across the bar with them.

One of the biggest Beer selections that I've ever seen under one roof!  And not just domestic crap, but imports, micro-brews, etc.  They had Magic Hat on Draft!  :)
Great Food;
Reasonably Priced;
Casual atmosphere;
Fast, Friendly Service;
a TON of TV's and VERY sports friendly!

CONS:
I wish the menu were more creative.
Lots of burgers and sandwiches, wings and typical bar foods and appetizers.


Suggestions:
My husband ordered the Pittsburgher (a big burger) and said it was really good.
I ordered the Swordfish (that was on for the Lenten Special) and it was also pretty good!

This place is tucked away in the recessed end segment of a long strip mall on Apache Blvd, so it's easy to miss if you're not looking out for it. Service is fast, and the food is relatively inexpensive - prices are just a tad over those of most Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley. Their pho is OK, though I find the flavor to be somewhat one-dimensional, without the herbal complexity of the pho in, say, Pho Thanh or Pho Avina. And I find the pho to be a bit on the salty side. A squeeze from the lime wedge served on the side helps cut the saltiness, while the fresh herbs served alongside the pho help to give the flavor a needed boost.",2013-10-24 05:46:00

This restaurant is set up so you can create your own Mediterranean meal, be it a pita wrap or bowl , and it is vegan, vegetarian , and meat eater friendly. 

I love Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food for the flavor and Cava does not disappoint, simply because it's 'fast-food'. There is no drive-thru, you do have to go in.

This visit I did a rice/grain bowl mix with Saffron rice ( brown is also available) and lentils ( these were black lentils). Because there wasn't enough falafel for to truly call it a serving, I got half falafel and half seasonal roasted veggies as my protein. What's cool is they'll let you sample sauces and spreads ( Baskin Robins style ) before you add them to your bowl. The Spicey feta was SO good, topped it all off with even more fresh veggies ( onions , lettuce, purple cabbage, etc) and a Tahini dressing which was BOMB.

I referenced Saddle Mountain Brewing Co. in my review of the Goodyear Ballpark because they serve Tail Dragger beers on draft. But this brewery offers more than a great selection of beers brewed on site.

Saddle Mountain Brewing is themed, from the names of the beers, to the menu and the decor, to honor the military. Flags were being hung outside while we waited to order. It's mostly centered on aircraft, so clearly, they are trying to make a connection with Luke Air Force Base. Regardless, it's a cool place to hang out for a few beers, but this place has a kitchen that could stand on its own.

Having been here several times before, I have noticed that the menu continues to evolve. The Jalapeño Bombers are my favorite appetizer. On other visits, I've enjoyed everything from pasta to gumbo. Today, it was time for a good old burger. The Triple B, with BBQ sauce and onion rings was cooked perfectly. And I enjoyed (my favorite) Tuskegee Red Tail and a Warhawk  with my meal. The food and the beers have never disappointed!

There are a lot of breweries popping up all around Arizona. This one has been around for a while. It reminds me of Four Peaks in a way, because that was the first brewery where I enjoyed something more substantial than the typical bar fare (and the beers are that good). Because Saddle Mountain continues to offer a great selection and rotation of beers paired with an excellent kitchen, they deserve an even stronger following. Keep up the good work, and God Bless America!",2016-05-31 05:52:56

I particularly love their blueberry scone (it sells out so fast though!), toffee pudding cake and their butter tarts - these ones are definitely a must try here. The hello dolly square, brownie and caramel scone are also good. Great selection of squares, scones, cake slices, tarts, cupcakes, macarons, and beverages like lattes, Sloane teas, etc. all in a really charming setting. It's easy to see why it's always busy. 

There are a few seats right by the entrance and more seats after the display case and cash register.

You can get guided tours where you get more in depth info, however none were starting anywhere close to the time we were there so we decided to do it on our own.

The work is spread out nicely, however I was hoping for more info on each piece.  At most there was 1-2 lines of description.  A lot of pieces said ""Most likely from Iran or Most likely from Turkey..etc).

There is a small cafe which I did not try.  It's place right in the middle of the first floor which I think causes some congestion in that area.  It would have been better had they put it off to a corner.  

Apparently there are performances here so check the website to see the calendar of events.  I think that might be interesting to see.

Very interesting history of organized crime and primarily Italian immigration in this country.  Special attention paid to the Mob in the growth of Vegas too.

I've used the audio tours in other museum and thought they really added something to the tour.

I was accompanied by two strapping young gentlemen. We viewed the menu and expected for the prices that the servings would be adequate and filling. 

Nope. So we were seated at the bar while waiting for a table, and the staff was generally friendly and attentive. The decor and layout is like many a hipster restaurant in the Toronto area. Nothing particularly riveting. When we were seated after about a ten minute wait, we were crammed into a small table - tables of the same size were being used to seat couples, but ours had an extra chair. Our side plates didn't even fit on the table which made the sharing aspect of our experience redundant. 

One of my dining partners and I both ordered the beef dip, which was the special on Wednesday. Had they created one sandwich, cut it in half and served it on two plates hoping we wouldn't notice? Was it really that small for $9? It was a great sandwich, but tiny. TINY. The beets were fine - a little under-seasoned and lacklustre. The brussels sprouts were great. My other friend ordered ribs which came to $19 and were not what one would expect to receive portion-wise for the price.

Once seated and greeted we ordered two shots and two beers. The shots came in sticky glasses and one of the beers had a floater in it. Thankfully, our server was nice enough to switch my beer out for a new one. 

I ended up ordering a PBR Burger with french fries and my boyfriend ordered chicken fingers. After seeing the chicken fingers, I kind of regretted getting a burger. The burger was vooked as requested, but it just wasn't what I was desiring. The chicken fingers appeared to be panko breaded. My boyfriend also got the Doritos mac and cheese which really was just average mac and cheese with crunched Doritos on top... don't let your curiosity get the best of you here...the mac and cheese is not all that great. 

Honestly, the best part of my meal was the french fries. They were so crunchy and golden, just like I prefer them. If it weren't for the french fries and the exceptional service, I likely would have given this place lower stars. So thank you Bronson for your excellent service and patience with my family...and PBR do NOT change your french fries!!

So, imagine my joy when I randomly drove past Mucho Burrito, a burrito joint that I hadn't tried yet. I wasn't expecting authenticity like many others scathe the chains for, but I was hoping for something tasty.

I give the place kudos for cleanliness. While I wasn't eating there, I certainly appreciated how presentable the place was, though dead at the time.

The woman serving me was little help. Being that there are 2 menu signs, one to your left, and one behind the server, it's confusing for a newb. Despite the fact that I was the only customer at that moment, I felt like I was seriously being rushed, and I didn't care for it at all. I quickly decided on a mucho burrito with chicken and steak, and before I could even start specifying my toppings, she dumped about six pounds of rice on it. I don't normally get rice, but I'm no ricist, so I let it slide. I picked out my usual suspect toppings, and anticipated the wait time while the burrito would be cooked. Hah, nope. She hands it to me as soon as the last topping was on. I suppose the toppings are kept warm in their stainless dungeons, and that may explain why the toppings didn't look all that fresh or inviting. The price was right (slightly more burrito than you would get for the same price at Burrito Boyz), but I was too suspicious of my new burrito friend to care.

Sure enough, not a damn thing stood out with this burrito. Every single topping was bland, and certainly not worth 10 bucks. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that Taco Bell's burritos are miles better than this lame-ass place, and that says a LOT.

And to add to the experience, some hours after consumption, I ended up a complete pukey mess. It took a few hours for the hell-wrap to vacate the premises, but it was enough damage to make my stomach sick for the next day as well. And to kick vagueness to the curb, I didn't eat or drink anything else that day, just water and this poor excuse for a 2nd rate option of a Mexican food lover's meal. Mucho Burrito is mucho no es bueno! Aye chihuahua!

Bonus kick in the cajones: I figured assigning my first ever 1-star review on Yelp was going to make me feel bad for whoever I was giving it to, but I draw the line at making me physically ill. Congrats, MB, you sub-par burrito putas get the ""EEK!""",2012-03-02 07:07:57

Truth be told, I really didn't need more dessert that day but I really wanted something spectacular to make up a very disappointing lunch that I had.

There were a bunch of items that looked quite enticing, including alfajore cookies (which I adore!) and a caramel flan.

My final pick was a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake! I shared it with my friend and we were both very happy with the cheesecake. The texture was more crumbly, rather than creamy and smooth, but I prefer my cheesecake like this. The dulce de leche was rich and delectable, a perfect match with the cheesecake.

We opted to sit at the bar not because it was busy but because we wanted to catch a game. The bar tender greeted us but was quite short for a bar that was 1/2 full but not busy. 

We started with some waters, a speciality drink, and a milkshake. The Milkshake and the speciality cocktail (winter warmer) were excellent. The shake was thick and tasty but easy to drink. The mixed drink was well crafted and mixed. In addition, we had an appetizer of chachos. They were nachos like I had never seen them before made with homemade chips and chicken. They were simple yet inviting, rather tasty.

As we move on we continue to ask questions about the menu and could tell the bar tender just didn't really care. It was also quite obvious that of the two ladies behind the bar they didn't work well together at all. The service overall wasn't terrible but it's not what I expect at a higher priced ala carte style restaurant.

For dinner we both ordered customer burgers and a side of tater tots to share. I ordered my dry aged beef burger medium and it was certainly closer to rare. It didn't bother me a ton as you could tell it was well cared for. My dining partner ordered a medium buffalo burger which was overcooked. The tater tots were okay but the seasoning was extremely poorly distributed across the tots. 

For such an expensive meal I expect something close to handcrafted perfection. BRGR to me is a knock off of Burgatory. I'll give it another shot but the truck was a lot better.

Perhaps this location needs a little more expertise from the other locations in the front and back of the house. As many have said before I could have easily walked to several other locations in the Galleria to stellar service and food.

I can not recommend this restaurant.  One look around and you see a sea of non-Asians seated at the tables and you should not walk, but RUN out of there.

I went tonight on a rainy Tuesday night with 2 girlfriends, and we ordered a feast of food (thinking there would be a 4th person to our trio).  From an overly doughy cripsy spring roll, to the dumplings in a broth that tasted suspect; General Chicken that had no heat and tasted oddly of fortune cookie batter, to the Cantonese noodles with bean curd and vegetables that was very ""meh""; the overly garlicked green vegetable, the over usage of water chestnut as a decoy for actual scallops in a scallop dish, and the obligatory few dim sum choices like the shrimp and veggie dumplings that were very chewy and very un-al-dente.  And the sticky rice with pork that was bland.  Ugh.  

This place was just awful...they use MSG in *EVERYTHING* and you will feel it during your meal and worse, afterwards.

Nonetheless the layouts are all the same so if I just continue to meander, eventually I will find what I am looking for - and then some (because I'm female and will shop anywhere).

Of the many times I have been here the ONLY time I have ever received any help was in the gardening section. I was very impressed by the young employee's (sorry, I forgot your name!) knowledge because I was throwing question after question at him about temperature, water schedule, shade issues, and if he thought the plant was hardy enough to survive my black thumb. I came out with some great plants, pots, and fertilizer. Unfortunately, two plants died, but that was because of too much direct sun and not being mature enough to handle that kind of heat. What is great about Home Depot is they have a 1 year warranty on their plants so keep your receipt and bring in your dead plant and they will give you store credit. I did not partake in this warranty due to sheer embarrassment, but I still think it's great that it is available.

My faves are the chocolate sorbet and the coconut sorbet. The chocolate sorbet tastes deeply rich. I haven't tried all the flavors, but why even stop at the ice cream. They have plenty of other treats to try. Please do try the marshmallows and the almond toffee brittle. They have got to be among the best things I have ever eaten. They taste sweet and flavorful and taste fresh. The marshmallows are like no other. These are what marshmallows are supposed to taste like.

I ordered the Crab Rangoon (my go to white guy Thai dish) and the Lad Nah (Lard Nah) with pork and Chinese Broccoli.  The Crab Rangoon wasn't bad, but with imitation crab it also wasn't inspiring.  The wonton wrapping was well prepared, but the filling just didn't have much going on.  The sweet and sour sauce was light and nicely jammy.

The Lad Nah was disappointing.  The noodles were cooked unevenly, with most of them being undercooked.  I couldn't eat most of them.  The pork wasn't bad, a little on the chewy side, but not bad.  The thinly sliced Chinese broccoli was nice enough.  The gravy had a light sweetness to it, something that I'm not used to in Lad Nah and something that didn't really help the dish.  It just wasn't very good.

The food is okay, but very expensive relative to the portion size.  I tried to order the savory crepe but they ran out.  Mon Dieu!  That's like a bar running out of beer!  I got instead the breakfast croissant with bacon - decent, a bit petit, but definitely not worth the price.

My wife ordered the French Omelet - nice, fluffy omelet filed with ham and gruyere and topped with fried potato straws.  This dish was actually pretty good.

With that being said, I absolutely love that most everything at Pomegranate Cafe is vegan & organic & bonus stars for the raw options. I went there the first time towards the end of October & I had some kind of a burrito. I ate the whole thing, it was delicious. I then ordered a caramel coconut drink from their coffee menu along with a desert. Everything was delicious. After I was finished m I went to the bathroom to wash my hands & I am not sure what happened but shortly after I came out, I got nauseated. I puked all my lunch which is way odd for me to so b/c I NEVER vomit/puke or anything. Not even when I  sick. Maybe I was so excited I ate too quick & too much? I don't know. Another weird thing that happened was, during our lunch, I asked to keep one of the menus b/c I wanted to continue browsing through (it was my first time there) I was told I couldn't b/c they were short of menus. LOL. Odd. Then a few minutes later she gave me back the menu. Alrighty. Ha!!

My B/F said that we should not come back b/c he was sure it was the food that made me sick but I refused to believe. We went back again a couple of weeks later & I had he raw tacos. They were good. We had a good experience. Except when I ordered my caramel coconut drink from the coffee menu, it didn't taste the same as last time. Like AT ALL. I ended up throwing it away. But, overall, a nice experience.

My 3rd visit just a couple of weeks ago, I ordered the French toast and was very disappointing. There was nothing French toast about this French toast. It was a pastry, like banana bread.

Pros:
-the have groupons all the time so you can usually get tickets for $5 (sun-thurs)
-you pick your seat ahead of time so your guaranteed a seat, plus the seats are huge!!
-the pretzel bites and fries were good
-drinks are $3.50 plus you get free refills. A lot cheaper than regular movie theaters 

Cons: 
-due to limited seating, you may not get the preferred seat you want if you don't purchase tickets in advance 
-the waiters are constantly walking around and talking to people so that's annoying when you're trying to enjoy the show
-some of the food is hit or miss. I had the quesadilla and it seemed as if it sat under a heat lamp for hours 
-in some of the theaters half of the service lights are out. In my row of 4 only one button actually worked. 

The last time my husband and I were here we had to ask 3 times for our drinks. I ordered a quesadilla, which was suppose to come with sour cream, and they forgot the sour cream. I had to ask again 3 times and then they ended up charging us for it. Lastly we tried to order the Wednesday unlimited pizza special and they said it was 1 per person, however the group next to us of 4 ordered and split it.

It really makes me wonder what they feed to raise these farmed Atlantic salmon to make them taste so terrible.  Very disappointing.

It was one of those recalls that are just for convenience if that makes sense... but we were at the 30 days and we had taken it to Fiat first since we have had multiple fiats we just prefer the dealer. They actually suggested to take it back to Carmax since they would need to charge the deductible on the warranty so we did. Carmax Service made appt and was ready for us. No waiting no nothing. We left it there since we wernt sure if the noise was the recall or not. They called later in the day to let us know parts wouldnt be there until the next day and the car was back together if we needed it, we could pick it up. We left it the next day about noon they called it was ready, no charge, everything done... no more noise! I can say that so far CARMAX has been very good to us and has done a great job!

OHl3NPwF_5b19zN_OmvMCA,KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,5,36,14,22,"With Kkulmat Korean Kitchen and TangTangTang opening up in recent weeks, Korean food in Las Vegas has taken a turn for the better. While KBBQ is all over the place and recently opened restaurants have taken towards improving the scene, non-BBQ restaurants have been hit and miss and most of them lean towards being bars before restaurants.

There are a few options around Las Vegas that have good Korean food, but Kkulmat and TangTangTang legitimately have the taste of Korea in their cooking, with very little to no lean towards ""fusion."" When I eat at these places, I think of my mom's best dishes or eating in Korea or perhaps Koreatown in LA.

TangTangTang has only been open a couple of weeks, but word seems to be getting out that there is a Sulleongtang-specialized place in Chinatown. The very professional wall signs made me suspicious this was a chain or had an established base somewhere else and I couldn't help but ask and learned that there are locations in Korea. So this one probably isn't as mom and pop as a lot of the Korean restaurants, but brings with it some history and an established menu.

Sulleongtang (an ox-bone soup that is light in flavor - you add your own salt, green onions, and whatever kimchi or radish you'd like), Naengmyun (Buckwheat noodles either served with spicy sauce or in an ice-cold broth), Ddukguk (rice cake soup optionally with dumplings and such), and Galbijjim (a stew featuring braised short ribs in a rich thick broth with veggies) are among the dozen or so options that are featured on the menu (with varities of almost all of these). They also have Bossam, which isn't particularly common which is a steamed pork belly served along with condiments and is traditionally eating wrapped in lettuce, though we didn't have wrapping lettuce when we tried it. Additionally, they have some BBQ plates like LA Galbi.

We haven't had a chance to try everything (and probably wouldn't ever try it all) but the Sulleongtang is solid. I found the broth a little thinner and lighter in flavor than ideal (for the best I've ever had, nothing competes with Han Bat in Los Angeles), but when mixed all up still creates that marriage of flavors that makes it very satisfying. Don't be shy about adding salt and green onions and throwing in your rice and kimchi. One thing that is particularly nice is their brisket is the best I've had in this type of soup (it's often an afterthought compared to other parts of the dish). Oh - the kimchi here is delicious with a strong garlic flavor and a satisfying sweetness to it.

My personal favorite so far was actually the Kimchi Dumpling and Dduk (rice cake) soup. It has a ton of flavor enhancing the flavor of the Dduk and Dumplings and was very satisfying. The egg and brisket complete the dish well. 

The Bossam was quite good, though we felt the pork belly was a little overcooked. Instead of being melt in your mouth, the meat was a tad tough. When eating a piece with more fat than meat, it was a little better.

Lastly, we tried the Gamjatang in Hot Pot form to be shared. Pork neck-bone stew is not my personal favorite, but it was pretty decent with the meat falling off the bone and plenty of potatoes and other veggies with lots of spices added. Still, it's a little too much work for me to eat!

Service was quite adequate, with servers generally on top of things. However, I will note that the first day we went they were out of Sulleongtang and were running out of Bossam so we had to get the smaller portion. For a place that hasn't been open long, understandable if a little frustrating. Still, it didn't take away from our experience as we were able to try more dishes this way.

Prices are definitely reasonable - Sulleongtang alone is plenty to feed a person and is priced at 9.99. Other dishes are generally around the same price or a little more expensive with most of the individual portion sizes not exceeding 11.99, while bigger share-sized stews hitting almost 30 dollars and Galbijjim (which is normally quite expensive) nearly 40 dollars. 

I was surprised this place didn't get much coverage - but nearly every table was occupied at lunch on a Saturday so I think the word is getting out there. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some solid Korean food that isn't fusion, bar food, or BBQ and along with Kkulmat have definitely upped the quality of available options in Las Vegas. If you haven't tried this type of Korean food, you're are definitely missing out!

We live super close to the water park & just never really got around to visiting.  The swim event provided us w/ the perfect opportunity to check out the entire park for free & we absolutely loved it!  We met up w/ family & friends, total of 6 adults & 6 kids and we all had such an awesome day.  The free swim event allowed for one parent per child for free entry.  Since we only have one child and both my husband & I wanted to go we purchased a single Adult Daily Pass at Nellis Airforce Base for $25 (Hubby is a veteran).  Parking was free for the event but normally $7.  I used to LOVE the old Wet-n-Wild as a kid way back in the day & was so happy they decided to open up a new one, close to home.  The new park is a lot smaller or maybe just felt that way as an adult now but still tons of fun!  They have an awesome toddler & kid's area w/ lots of smaller slides & splash zones geared for children ages 3 & up.  My fav was the lazy river, I'm such a chicken w/ rides, lol.  They have life jacket type floaties for the lil ones to use so no need to bring your own unless thats your thing.  They also have plenty of canopy & umbrella shaded areas w/ chairs & loungers so no need to rent a cabana unless your foo foo & need a butler to serve your ass, lol.  We brought in water & snacks (they permit bottled water as long as they are sealed & snacks no larger than 3.5oz). We bought lunch at the park, we ordered the chicken sandwich w/ fries entree & the chicken wrap w/ fruit entree (drinks sold separately).  Reasonably priced & pretty yummy for park food, our total was less than $20.  I did splurge on a regular sized Icee which was around $5 but so worth it for such a hot day under the sun.  The fam & I had such a great time, we're probably gonna grab ourselves season passes next time.  Such an excellent place to spend the day w/ the fam.  

So we ended up purchasing 3 season tickets for $185 at the base and literally the next day Wet-n-Wild has a new promo going: buy a daily pass for $39.99 & get the rest of the season free.  Bum deal for us, could've saved a bit had we known about the promo.  I had to knock off a couple stars cause the last two times we went in, the bag checker had beef w/ us bringing in snacks for my toddler son.  Per Wet-n-Wild's website:  Coolers may contain:

Baby-friendly snacks in 3.5 oz individual serving sizes (cracker packs, teething cookies, fruit snacks, etc)
Baby food in plastic containers
Factory-sealed water bottles

We get to the gate the other day & the bag checker has issues w/ us bringing in a 1.13oz snack size bag of chips.  The bag checker, Remy gave us a scolding, not sure why cause it meets their crappy cooler policy, but said he would allow it this one time.  So today we get there and there were two bag checkers, possibly one in training & wouldn't allow us to bring in a 1.9oz snack size of cookies and made us throw them out!  This was so freaking annoying cause the snacks we have brought meet their policy.  So this time we ask to talk w/ a supervisor regarding their B.S. Cooler Policy.  We ended up speaking w/ Dominic, one of the supervisors and he apologized & admitted Wet-n-Wild was in the wrong for not allowing us to bring in the snacks.  He comped us 3 free meal vouchers and said he would inform his staff about following the correct policy.  I think its pretty crappy how strict their cooler policy is, they already make money off the tickets.  They are nickel & diming every consumer, not everyone wants to eat their park food, especially when the lines are ridiculously long & its not the healthiest food choices.  For many season ticket holders, going for just a few hours and bringing a little snack for our little ones really shouldn't be a problem.  Get it together Wet-n-Wild!!!",2016-07-15 01:47:36

After asking around, Rol San kept coming up as a standby. I have to say that reading the reviews made me nervous that food was going to suck, we wouldn't get a table (4 adults and 2 babies), or that we were going to get ripped off, but none of that happened. Rol San is completely, totally acceptable lol. Based on tips from other Yelpers we walked straight to the back. I think it was almost 10am when we got there and we were able to get a big table for the 6 of us. The food is relatively average - I wouldn't say it is better than other places, but it is certainly not worse. Not being able to read Chinese made it a bit challenging to remember what items were what based on the English translation, but it was fine in the end. I actually kind of liked being able to look at the overall menu and order everything all at once - it made it easier to pace ourselves and not over-order. 

With respect to the food, a sample of what we ate:
- Squid tentacles were fine, golden and not over-battered. 
- Soup dumplings (not xiao long bao) that were filled with meat and sitting on lettuce leaves - pretty tasty (I have to assume due to msg lol)
- I liked the lotus leaf sticky rice with meat - they were reasonably plump and filled up. 
- Deep fried chicken wings - these were awesome as I LOVE chicken wings and never see this at dim sum. We got 5 middle sections (yessss), large ones, crispy and delicious - they reminded me of the kind of wings you'd get at a Chinese buffet. 
- Black bean pork ribs - one of my favourite dim sum items - really like them.
- Turnip cake had a nice sear to it. 
- Curry cuttlefish are lightly curried, not too strong. 
- Siu mai were actually decent - I don't usually like them but these were well seasoned and you get a clean porky taste. 

The service was almost non-existent beyond coming to get the order paper, but it also wasn't rude. If we needed more napkins or water, we had to go to the front desk. Everything we ordered arrived, and it was nicely staggered - I don't think it was on purpose but it meant we got a steady stream of food. We were charged the correct amount - they did add on a 13% service charge for our group of 4+2, but that was fine, and the total came to about $25 per adult. They accept visa which was great too.

As far as prices, Culver's is a little higher than other fast food chains. However, they do have a snack pack deal for around $5.",2017-03-27 03:42:29

First off, I don't usually like Milestones. I was never a fan of their food. Having finished work, we went there for some food. They lost a star because of the appetizer. It was the dip and the chips tasted like it was handled by sweaty hands. Not my favorite dish..... the dip was pretty good though. 

We ordered the meatloaf and the steak. The steak was nothing to write home about. What can i say, steak is steak. Unless it is an amazing cut, it all taste the same. The baked potato was a little bland because they just added green onions and sour cream. Other places, they would add things like bacon bits, or butter, but not this place....second lost star

The meatloaf was pretty good. It was a little spiced, but not too spicy. everyone enjoyed it. 

Overall, the price and the service was pretty good. A dinner for 4 ran just over $100. They have a special on Wed where couples dine for $50 and it includes 1 appetizer, 2 course, and 1 desert. Overall a good value.

But anyway, you may remember that this is the former location of the Locker Room. These guys have done a fantastic job of classing up the decor. It's nice. Not cold and pretentious nice, but comfy and clean nice.

The old wooden bar has been replaced with a dark grey granite slab. The dart boards are gone. Now in that area, there are now some low, angular couches for conversation and looking pretty. 

You'll also notice LOADS of flat panel TVs. Well, duh. It's a video bar! Sure, you've got the usual bizarre euro techno videos playing. Thankfully there are clips of TV shows and movies interspersed.

For instance, on comedy night, you're likely to see some bits from Will & Grace, SNL, and MadTV. Musicals night will have parts of The Sound of Music and Grease.

They've also added drag bingo on Mondays. It starts when 2-4-1's end, but they are replaced new drink specials. Plus, if you wear a big hat, you get dollar shots. Sometimes they offer them to you anyway, hat or not! 

Of course, the bingo is fun too. $5 gets you 4 cards which you can re-use each round. Some prizes are a little lame, but others are pretty cool! The night I was there, the grand prize was tickets to see Eartha Kitt. I could pass on that. But I heard another time it was a trip to Rocky Point for Pride.

The slaw and beans were ok, the ribs he said and I tasted and agreed, were dry and tough.  I had fried catfish which came out looking amazing.

The ambiance is casual-yet-classy, with either booth or bar seating. It's somewhat loud, but still great for bringing a group of four and chatting it up. 

I really enjoyed the frites, which came with an assortment of delicious sauces the chefs are proud of. I hate ketchup, but the *curried* ketchup was outstanding! And while we're on the topic of curry, there's always the curried cauliflower app. Bring your herbivore friends to Joe's to start off your night and I don't think they can complain too much. 

Of course, there are more rich options as well. Lots of twists on steak, and plenty of items featuring chimichurri...it's like a western European's take on Argentinian entrees. The signature item is a ""B.I.G."" burger, yet another throwback to the 90s rap motif. 

As cool as this is, I'm more excited for the drinks. When you're not getting a 40 oz. (YES, this is totally a thing you can order here), you can indulge in a modest, but delightful craft beer menu. On top of that are the *cocktails*. Designed by the mastermind behind my five-star review of Last Drop at the Hermosa (Travis Nass), these beverages are aiming to pack a tasty punch--at a single-digit price. And while not everything blew me away, I will say the Gin and Juice is choice. An absolute must. For the weaker among you, try the Sunnyslope Ice Tea. And like the rest of the service, these will fly out so fast as to appear effortless, all courtesy of a kind and fun staff. 

Now that retro themes are at the cusp of syncing with my childhood memories, I'm starting to feel old. I can't tell you *that* much about the early-mid 90s, only that they were seemingly awesome, harmonious, and certainly much more fun than the late 2010s are shaping up to be.

I must confess that I previously just came here for the view and vibe (totally 5 stars), not for the drinks and food. But all of that has changed. The martinis are oh so fab (the Mango Madness is my favorite - 5 stars) and the appetizers are a great quick bite (especially at 1/2 off).

Being me, I, naturally, went right for the chicken wings. They were done sorta lollipop-style. The wings were huge and looked like they were butterflied. And the whole wing (lollipop bone and all) was breaded and fried. The sauce had a nice kick to it (one size fits all - no mild, medium, or hot options). It was spicy, but had a lot of sweetness to it. And instead of serving a side of dipping sauce, the wings were topped with blue cheese crumbles.

Complimentary Sourdough Bread, it was cold. (period). Didn't even finish it. Suggestion... why not keep it warm? Came with whipped butter but still would prefer it warm.

Starter (Ember Grilled Hen-o'-the-Woods Mushrooms)
- Wow, these were literally the best mushrooms I've ever had, and i'm not vegetarian
- The slight char brought out an aromatic and smokey flavour, which was quite unique
- One of the dishes which I would order again

Gf ordered half order of Russet Potato Gnocchi and it was filling enough. She liked it but I thought it was quite plain.

I ordered the (Ling Cod on Celery Root Velouté) but they were out of cod and I believe it was replaced by some fresh caught Mackerel. It was very well cooked, 3 pieces of fish (which was more than I expected), slight crisp on the outside but moist and great texture. A creme-ie soup like sauce with few brussel sprout pieces and some hazlenut chunks. Had great taste and textures.

The short and not so sweet story: two of us ordered the veggie club for a late lunch, unfortunately said sandwich came out with mayo on it, totally unexpected since it was not in the description though it was listed for other sandwiches, plus the club was touted as being made with tomato basil jam on vegan bread so I didn't even think to ask if it had mayo...Anyway, I do not, under any circumstances, eat mayo. I went up to the counter and verified that it was indeed mayo. The counterperson was nice and she offered me a half sandwich without mayo. The kitchen person said she couldn't make a half sandwich. So I said, how about just a two layer club, instead of the three (like one piece of bread cut in half and assembled together with some veggies? The counterperson seemed to understand this to be a solution and I thought I had some lunch coming. But It never came. I would have liked to have witnessed some cooperative communication instead of a timid server trying (but not hard enough) to make good in spite of an oppressive bitch. I would have paid for another damn sandwich if that's all it would have taken to get fed, or I would have left to find lunch elsewhere if I had been informed that my request was unreasonable. Disgusted, I decided just to get a soy latte on my way out, but they did not have the soymilk that they advertised on the board for an extra $.50, the icing on the cake of my void. So, I don't trust the chalk board, I sure as sugar can't rely on the staff to work together as a team and judging by my sweet toothed partner's reaction, I don't even believe they can make a good cookie.",2012-08-15 00:49:03

He's actually called me at 12:30 at night, from a bar, talking about how he wants Indian Food. It's as though he can already feel the hangover coming on and wants to make sure his priorities are in check. 1) Get home (or wherever) safely 2) Indian Food. I may have mixed up the order.

This Indian Delhi Palace is apparently under the same ownership as the Tempe location, but I like this one much better. For several reasons:

1) The Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING. Like, I've never had buffet food this good before. I don't really like Tandoori Chicken. Honestly, the color kind of freaks me out. I know it's from the sauce or whatever, but chicken, on the bone, with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird. I'll pass. But boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce? Don't mind if I DO!

2) This location has a much larger variety of dishes, especially vegetarian dishes, which are usually my favorite offerings at an Indian lunch buffet (see above about tandoori chicken freaking me out).

3) Um, hello? It looks like a freaking palace. These guys did not hold back and I freaking love them for it. I actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are. I wouldn't mind if Souper Salad and Sweet Tomato hopped on this trend already. I mean, how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? Not that hard really. Up your game, guys.

However, the only complaint I have about Indian Delhi Palace, and the primary reason why Flavors of India remains my favorite Indian Lunch Buffet has to do with the atmosphere. Yes, I appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets, but Delhi Palace doesn't have any booths. And when I'm hungover, I need a freaking booth. I need my own little eating sofa. I need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like I'm enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat. That's what I need, and that's what Flavors of India gives me. Oh, and some Bollywood wouldn't hurt either.",2009-10-14 04:02:23

Had this been a review for last year, it would have been 5 stars.  We went here last year for St. Patty's Day - they have a great menu of roasted potato soup, corn beef/cabbage/carrot/potato and creme brulee for dessert.  LAST YEAR we were served Guinness with green sugar rimmed glasses and the bartender gave us green beer (although they supposedly weren't allowed due to a mess on the bar the previous year).  Our waiter was GREAT!

Jump ahead exactly 12 months.  We returned for a repeat of the great time we had in 2010, however, we were met with HORRIBLE service and a bartender who REFUSED to add sugar to our Guinness!!  REFUSED!  I have NEVER been refused something so simple, plus they set precedence for it the previous year.  MARY was the bartender and BONNIE was our server - UGH!  NEVER AGAIN!  I even showed Bonnie a photo of my beer on my phone with the ""America"" napkin under it.  She really didn't care.  She also only checked on us once the entire 2 hours we were there, and we had to hunt down people to get us refills on drinks, and pay our bill.  The table next to ours agreed with the bad service when they had to yell for someone to take their bill, too.

The food was okay, the presentation of the corned beef/cabbage was much nicer last year.  And the dessert was blah.

I was pretty excited for these items because I have never had vegan or gluten-free anything on purpose. What can I say.... I like my meat and gluten.

I ate the brownie that night after dinner. It did not have any almond flavor, was more of a cake consistency, and definitely bitter. Now, these all sound negative but from what I know, brownie preferences vary. So I would say that if you like fluffier brownies and dark cacao, then this is the brownie for you. I, however, do not. I like 'em dense and chocolate-y sweet! I saved the scone for the next morning before a huge test. I woke up feeling not so good :( and figured it was something I ate for dinner. But still, I ate half the scone while driving to my test. It was decent but a little salty. Later on, mid-way through the exam, I just started having a heavy rock feeling build in my stomach. Stomach cramps, nausea, and lightheaded-ness hit me. Ugh. UGGGGGGHHHHHHHH. Ugh ugh ugh.

I haven't eaten anything solid in 48 hours and Gatorade is now my best friend.  Now, do I blame VST?

So....when the jerk-off category of ""New York-style Pizza"" fails to move your taste buds to orgasmic heights, and you want real Italian pizza, go to Settebello or Ferraros.

So, why only a 3 start rating?  Plain and simple - quality of service.  The staff here is by far the least knowledgeable about sushi that I have every experienced.  It's clear they all want to be there because sushi is expensive and that's how tips get bigger.  Bartenders are completely uninformed about sake, which should always be an easy sell with sushi.  I had a server ask me to cash out in the middle of a meal once so she could go pick up her kid.  Just in case the managers care to read these reviews, a complaint like this should always come with some advice.  A better way to handle a server leaving in the middle of a meal is to transfer the check and let them collect all or part of the tip the next day.  Share some knowledge with the staff about the ingredients in the kitchen and why customers should love the product.  I could go on, but I'd rather focus on the food.

Sul lung tang: it's a pork bone broth that's very rich but they don't salt it. When it comes you have to add the salt that's on the table. I thought it was good but it's not the best I've had. But I did thoroughly enjoyed it with my rice and kimchee. 

Pork neck soup- 5 stars. Soo good and the soup is packed with ingredients. I'm definitely gonna order this next time. There's a boneless version too but I'm thinking the bone one has more flavor. It's a little on the peppery spicy side. 

Bossom - 5 stars. The meat was so good and tender. It's pork belly meat that you eat with various pickled veggies. They give you pickled radish, some leeks and another pickled spicy root veggie. It was so delicious!!

I came here for my mother's 50th birthday (so those reading with birthday dinner ideas have something to go off of). Inside, it's a big large room split with a big sailboat model in the middle of the room. The other side of the room is just a bar and s couple of small tables. They also have a full rowboat hung from the ceiling. I definitely got the feel that they should have amazing seafood dishes.

For the starters, I got the Lobster Mac n Cheese as well as the Lobster Chowder. And I think I agree on some of these other reviews. Their starters were good! The lobster chowder was full of deliciousness and had a certain kick to it, as a chowder should have. The Mac n Cheese is definitely good, the only problem about it is that it's served in a huge dish with a small portion. And for $9 I don't know if it's worth it. I can say though that it is tasty and very cheesy. They don't use the usual macaroni, and it's a little thicker.

My main dish, I ordered the Latin Mopped & Brined Pork Chop. And considering its the most popular dish of the restaurant, it better be good. And, it was. The sauce was very intriguing to my taste. It kind of had a BBQ taste, but at the same time it felt like it was mixed with worchester for that type of spicy vinegary kind of taste. Anyways, I can't explain it but lets just say it's a treat. It's also served with a bell pepper filled with diced carrots and celery stacked neatly on top of a small fried grits cake.

For dessert, I ordered the Butterscotch Creme Brûlée. And, it was a delicious. The only problem I found with the dessert was that the cookies were a little hard. If those cinnamon cookies were soft and the type that just melts in your mouth... That dessert would be perfect. (For those who were wondering, there wasn't a free dessert for the birthday girl D: but they put a candle in the dessert that she did order)

They gave us tags with gangster names and a mobster narrator as our guide.  While walking through different segments, there were about 4 actors that we came in contact with that helped lead us through the exhibit--other mobsters and a cop.

Before this part, though, you have the option of taking pictures (which we opted to buy for $20, and got 2 of them with different backgrounds).  

I did like the different decor and sets that they used in this exhibit--from New York to Vegas, a jewelry store (staged to look like it was broken into), Hollywood, and at the end, your fate was definitely decided.

The experience itself involved reading about mobsters/events that led to the creation of Vegas, their personal effects, and a documentary about the making of The Godfather movies and the ties to the mob (if you stay and watch it in its entirety, approx. an hour long).

I was pretty interested in learning about the historical ties that the mob had to Vegas, and I honestly enjoy reading/going to museums, so this was definitely my type of activity.

Our waiter asked my husband what he enjoyed most in food and helped him choose the BBQ shrimp dish.  I needed no assistance, as I listened to him speak with hubby,  the passion with which he described the dishes I knew to order one of the most difficult dishes to prepare on that menu, well at least to prepare it properly, the way a true Southern chef will.  It needs experience, patience and LOTS AND LOTS of love.  Lola's has this in spades so I ordered the Etouffee.

There are a few dishes I NEVER order out, like Moussaka, Lasagna and Etouffee.  These are dishes that personify their prospective ethinicities and are rarely worth eating in a commercial setting.  Well Lola's Etouffee is as good as it gets.  As soon as I took that first spoonful in my mouth I was transported back to New Orleans and their amazing cuisine.  The crawfish perfectly prepared, the sauce was spicy and the vegetables were chunky and fresh.  It is served with rice and a basket of freshly grilled bread.  The bread dipped into the sauce is amazing.  I skipped the rice and just used the bread because it tasted to wonderful together.

Hubby loved his BBQ Shrimp dish and devoured the entire dish before I was even halfway finished with mine.  He said the shrimp was also cooked perfectly and the sauce was fabulous.  He loved dipping the bread in his sauce too.  We also had crab cakes and crawfish puppies to start with, both were EXCELLENT.  I would go back for those crawfish puppies any day of the week.

Unfortunately we were stuffed and avoiding the sugars, so we did not indulge in the desserts, but I think we will have to make an exception next time and have some.

Side note for my doggy lovers, they do accept dogs on the patio as long as they are leashed and well behaved.  Also rumor has it they are opening a second location in Summerlin at the end of the summer.  I CAN'T WAIT, they will be oh so closer to us then.",2014-05-26 03:41:14

I'm gonna say the reason I am even writing this review is the pasta I received.  It was unforgivable.   Pappardelle portobello Alfredo was the name of the dish, it had three mushroom bits on the whole dish.  IA had to ask for more sauce because it was so dry, and the pasta was mushy.  What a tragedy to have overcooked pasta at a pasta place.  :(    Rosemary chicken needed more sauce as well.
The tiramisu was gross.  Tasteless except for the old coffee mush underneath the mascarpone.  
I am so glad that the salad was good and never ending, otherwise this pregnant mama would have been a bear.  
I was peeved at the service time, it took 10 to 25 minutes to get water.  What was so irritating about that was that there were four or five servers hanging around the bar shooting the ship the whole time I was there.  
I called and talked to manager Lisa and she listened attentively and offered an apology.  I appreciate her listening and empathizing so they've got that going for them.  She offered a gift card, so we will give it another try and hopefully it's better this time around!",2015-06-08 23:13:11

Vidas is in a prime location, hence gets a fair amount of business just due to that fact.

Then what? Their food was probably between 3-4 stars, note the ""was"". I had not gone to Vidas for 2-3 months, but this visit was a severe disappointment. Not only did they raise the prices on their menus, they made it so you can't select your side from their list of sides when ordering from 3/4 of the menu.

Let's get onto the food... there is something to be said about a restaurant when the chips and salsa are the best thing for your meal. I ordered a Cobb Salad, but due to the ""loudness"" in the restaurant, the order was taken as a House Salad. Sigh... I was in a rush, so I did not have them make a new salad. Either way, the salad was ALOT of iceberg lettuce. There was 1/4 of an avocado, some corn, and simple beans. Fairly bland dressing... all for $7. I am not sure what part of that salad constitutes the extra $4, maybe the location?

Another person ordered a ground beef taco. People at Qdoba, Chipotle, or any of the fast food ""Mexican"" joints at least know how to drain the fat from the meat before putting it into the taco shell. Vida apparently does not understand this process. The taco my friend got was a soggy mess dripping with grease. When you can see your reflection on the taco, not good.

It's a great addition to just plain grilled veggies. 
The sauce and seasoning on the table were both tasty. The sauce which looked like soy sauce had a very light/mild flavour which was not too salty. It tasted a bit like cooking wine. The red seasoning was a blend of spices that I think included paprika and Cajun.

I finally decided to check it out on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm. The parking lot is always full here. There's the coffee shop, a tattoo place, and Table Thai restaurant.

The outside windows are heavily painted, so you can't really see inside. When I walked in I was surprised to see the place about 80% full with people and their laptops. Its much bigger inside than I imagined, as well as having an outdoor patio. Now I know why the parking lot is always full....I always thought it was people going across the street to Sunset Park. 

The staff was friendly and patient with me because I'm not a coffee snob, and I just wanted a iced coffee, preferably a mocha. The lady explained a couple of my options and I went with the cold brewed version with a little bit of cream and white mocha flavor. The coffee was smooth, no bitterness, and needed no additional adds. Delicious!!!!

This is definitely Hipster central. Almost every guy in here was sporting a beard, checkered shirt, and jeans...even on a hot afternoon. Most looked like they had never seen the sun. I don't know about you, but when the temperature is above 80, you will find me only in shorts, flip flops, and a nice comfortable lightweight shirt. It wasn't like the coffee shop was A/C'd down to 70. I just find this a bit....strange. Almost like ""Hey lets go to the coffeeshop"" ""OK, I'll get my hipster wardrobe on and we can go"" LOL. Now don't get all offended, this is just a simple observation. I only saw one other guy wearing shorts out of 20. 

Another observation is that other than their own group or partner, no one even looks at anyone else. They are either buried in their laptop or other device. No smiles, no human interaction. Its the exact opposite of a bar/saloon atmosphere.

I'm not too keen on that. I like the fresh food counters and the tweens who work at Loblaws.  They're are super cheerful and polite, unlike those Food Basics tweens--I'm not too keen on those lack-luster tweens. The display of cupcakes was enough to make me relapse on my cupcake sobriety.  

The customer service is prompt and I'm very keen on this detail.  I don't care for waiting in lines, and I'm not too keen on Metro's mostly automated self-serve checkout. Not too keen on the creepy person who stands at that podium telling you to take your bag off the counter.  

All in all, I forgot to mention how much Loblaws' cupcakes stink. It's very frustrating cuz they look attractive but in reality, they're just don't taste good enough.

These people are sandwich building pros. One of us has tried and enjoyed the breakfast sandwich, but my go-to is the grilled cheese with peameal bacon (the Hogtown). It comes with the grainy mustard, but I ask for the home brown sauce on it as well. Sandwiches sometimes take a little bit of time to create, but it's worth the wait because all these things -- the bacon, eggs, the bread -- need to get a little greasy on the grill. And hot!

Rasher's is generous with the condiments -- you can have any combo of sauce on your sandwich, or get some on the side. One problem is that they don't have this list listed anywhere. (Who would know that the delicious brown sauce exists?)

Bathroom doors are cool and thematic -- meat locker style. Press the red knob to get out.

We went by a few times a few months back and were surprised to find it closed, and the hours weren't posted on the door. We were worried Rasher's had gone out of biz!

Loaded fries - fries could have used a little seasoning topped with melted cheese and bacon. Bacon tastes precooked and not real bacon. I don't recommend those. Not even ketchup or ranch could save these. 

Cheeseburger Flatbread - flatbread topped with ground beef , cheese , bacon , tomato and pickle , flatbread is usually crispy. Not here. It also has barely any pickles which makes this dish IMO. Usually this is something I always order because it's tasty. I didn't enjoy it at the this location. 

Nachos - tortilla chips with melted cheese , ground beef , salsa , beans , sour cream and guacamole. They didn't skimp on toppings but they could have gave more salsa for the heaps of chips. The guac tasted like it came out of a bag.

I first came down to the Burgh to attend Point Park University.  They used to schedule a welcome back party on the boat every year in August our first week in school.  The first time seeing the city from the river was so magical for me!  I think that's when I feel in love with it.  Seriously, you can get the view from the highway, the tall buildings or even Mt. Washington, but this is a totally different perspective.  One you can get to by yourself.  I just love it!

I looked forward to that time on the boat every year!  It even put so much of an impression on me that I considered it for my wedding.  Ultimately we decided to have our wedding in Erie, but if we would have had it in Pittsburgh, it would have been my first choice.  It's just such a unique way to experience the city!  

They usually sail a good way along each of the rivers so you get to take in every last part of the city.  I love being able to float past all the main hot spots of the city, especially the Point and the Stadiums.  And you can't beat that cool summer breeze coming from the top of the boat. 

I love that they offer a slew of different cruises, from the family ice cream sundays to the dinner and dancing cruises and everything in between, they pack that schedule full!

I did my homework looking into KIA Soul cause it fits all the things looking for my needs and most my budget range. I just went right down the KIA Soul tell found the right one. We sat down starting talking numbers came up with deal that comfortable with and later that night walked off the lot with new KIA Soul. 

Every step along the way never felt like had to buy the car on the spot. Not that any car person is not friendly cause really only way they make money is if you walk off the lot with car. The salesperson Michael great guy and really thorough came to explaining all the features and had answer for any or all my questions had about the Soul. If there any salesman recommend at Findley Kia Michael is the guy. The finance department sorry forget the name. It came to extended warranty or GAP (he had explain that one since never heard of it before) never push or felt pressure that NEED it. He immediately got the vibe truth between the factory warranty of new KIA the six year bumper bumper coverage then ten year 100,000 warranty. No on any extra warranty. No other car company that can do better in my mind or peace of mind think about my old car.

The last step in the process the gentlemen again sorry forget his name. He went over the features of the car with me was great. Sent me on my way.

I had the mushroom over spinach with cheese as an appetizer. It was in a tub of cheesy cream sauce. Way to heavy for my taste. It would have been much better with just a touch of sauce.
The veal piccata actually had a lovely sauce with angel hair pasta. Unfortunately the veal was really chewy. Not sure whether it was the quality or the prep. 
My husband has a gluten allergy. He had a severe reaction to his dinner. We're not sure what it was from. Perhaps the GF pasta wasn't cooked in separate water. Don't know. I wouldn't recommend it for the gluten intolerant.
On the plus side the service was great and the wine list had some lovely choices.",2014-05-07 20:12:59
-vx1vbXltLHYT5meo1pX8g,IC6j_3C7-LuOjEcHN-OHVQ,xvcGZGoLwWpmDMMY1VN-OA,5,0,0,0,"Having lived in Portland, OR the last 5 years - I've become somewhat of a food-snob and sometime critic. I loved living in a town that is known for it's fantastic dining - unique food trucks - and utter lack of national chain restaurants.  Moving to Phoenix was a good thing - I love the cactus, the sun, and swimming pools.  But I also love exploring new locations to dine.  I enjoy exciting menu options - new things I've never tried, old familiar things that are re-created, and old familiar things done just the right way that you expect.

How excited I was to receive an invitation for a complimentary lunch at the new Scottsdale location of the Thirsty Lion Gastropub and Grill!  I have to admit - I was a bit pensive thinking of how my previous experiences would translate to this new location. 

Walking in the front door - all concerns disappeared.  Staff at the front of the house were efficient and friendly.  Just what you expect.

We were given a choice of seating locations and selected one by the window.  They even have some outdoor seating that would be fabulous in this wonderful spring we're enjoying.

Our Server - I believe it was Matt C - showed right up as soon as we sat down and took our drink order.  Matt was just like the others we had met - helpful, easy to chat with, efficient, and present when he needed to be without being a ""helicopter server"".

We reviewed various appetizer options - I was impressed with the list.  We quickly settled on the tempura beans.  While we waited for them - we reviewed the menu.  I noted that I was pleased with the number of menu options that I had to choose from - not too many, not too few... just right.  And very enticing.  I love it when I have a hard time choosing between several options - rather than trying to zero in on the least offensive one!

The appetizer came out suprisingly quick - hot, tasty, and an appropriate amount for two people with an appetite.  I would have preferred they had a little less batter - but not so much i hesitated to eat them. They were awesome!  The dipping sauce served with them was very very very good.

We next narrowed down our main courses.  Dining companion went for the fish and chips - I struggled between the enchilada stack - it sounds awesome - and the Reuben.  Matt said both were solid - but he LOVED their ruben.  Ahh - it's March.  St Paddy's is coming up ... and since I had had a nice big meal last night - I hoped that the sandwich would serve a purpose - to fulfill it's role as a delicacy that ""a king uses to purge himself of the ""demon of gluttony"". ""  Sorry ... this sandwich was so good - I believe their Corned Beef did the opposite to me.  I asked for a side of grain mustard - I don't know if it's home made or not - Matt told us that they use fresh product everywhere on the menu.  It shows.  The bread was the freshest rye I've ever had.  Every ingredient seemed as if they had labored for days to find the right product or recipe to complete my dish.  Loved the fries - but I just can't get over how much I loved my sandwich. 

My dining companion had the fish and chips.  I tasted a bite with the tarter sauce and loved it.  Very solid.  He substituted the fries (which I LOVED with my Reuben) for a salad.  Blasphemy! lol... his salad was fresh and the dressing again - tasted homemade.  If it's not - they've found a great purveyor!   He filled up quickly - so I was able to taste his cole slaw.  OMG - seriously the best coleslaw I've ever had.  Too often it's over dressed, over sweet, watery, bland.  This was perfect.  I could go back just to have a side of slaw!  (Next time - regardless of what I order - I may just get a side of slaw!)

Desert was good.  He had the creme brûlée - very good.  I ordered the blackberry cobbler with an orange scented crust and vanilla bean ice cream.  Very very good - only criticism was that there was a little ""too much"" blackberry... but hey - i'd complain VERY loudly if there was't enough. 

Service was solid - Matt was perfect.  Kitchen sent out the food very fast, well prepared, hot, and spot on.  Manager circulated through to check on all patrons.  Smart.  How else are you going to know how things are going.  I'm surprised more managers don't show up table side!

The location is fantastic.  Decor makes you feel like you're in a pub as expected.  Several tables filled - one with a very large group that seemed to enjoy just as quick service as we did at our table of two.  Bathrooms were easy to access and spotless.  

Bottomline - Home Run! (Oh wait - that's what I need to do next - spring training games and then back to the Thirsty Lion for more fantastic dining.)  

Thanks for the invitation Thirsty Lion.  It's gutsy thing to open yourself up to folks who like to critisize restaurants online.  You've got it figured out.  Bravo!  And thanks for bringing a bit of Portland to the Sonoran Desert!",2015-03-05 04:47:05

This place has been my go to weekend breakfast spot for years. Hello, day drinking begining at 7am on game days?? You know me...sign me up. I am eternally in love with the home fries, and have been known to stop by just for a side of them ""to go"" 

But I went last Thursday with my 7 year old niece Isabella who was home sick from school (whole other story starting at about 5am which started with my sister calling...""Please Nesto watch her for me or I'll lose my job"") As a bachelor who eats out a lot, not a ton in the fridge for a kid....so....breakfast? Get in the car.

Seated right away, as always. That's where the service stalled. Birds chirping as my niece looks at me with big sick-y eyes. No water, no server, busser or hostess to flag down. 

Finally blondie comes up and looks a bit irritated to se us. ""Do you know what you want ('yet'? seems to be the unspoken word she wants to throw out to finish the question) as if we have been wasting her time in the 10  minutes we haven't seen her. Yes we do. Pancake and OJ for Bell, Coffee two eggs over med, home fries and dry rye for me. 

She turns, grabs a tray of complimentary pickles off a side bar and slides them onto the table. The bright green are great. Garlicky and crisp. 

5 min, she brings the drinks. kids cup for Bell. No straw. I don't notice it immediately but blondie is right across the isle helping a guy in a tie so when she turns I get her attention. Again she seems pissed that I asked for a straw and drops 4 on the table. WTH?
 15 more minutes for food. I am a little interested and not pleased with the fact that the butter and syrup are in disposable pre-packaged containers. Has this always been the case? I am not a pancake eater, so I don't really know, but the place is a BAKERY. Surely they can dole out some butter and have syrup on hand. That was kinda weird. 

I was so distracted by that, that I realized after blondie left. NO friggin silverware. OK, now I am starting to get miffed. Flag her down again.

Potatoes, cold. Final straw. The rye was delish. Love that stuff chewy and flavorful. But largely, we left two almost untouched plates as we left the place. 

Maybe it was just a bad day for blondie. But that was not a great experience at one of my favorite places. I even forgot to buy a loaf of rye dammit.",2011-02-14 18:56:35

First round didn't go well at all....long wait for the table (1hr), long wait for the food (45min), long wait for the dessert (20min)....food was overcooked and not amazing. Crazy loud club like atmosphere. Was it a fluke? Everyone else seems to love this place!

So round two...Came in on a Tuesday night with a reservation...not needed. Sat down and ordered fairly quickly. Never received the comp popcorn. Got the food, perfectly cooked, but never checked on. Had to request for refills twice. I was given the bill WITHOUT being asked if we wanted dessert (we did)....not even sure if I got a thank you.  

I asked the server for a milkshake recommendation, (they make all shakes virgin if requested), and was told about the twinkie cake. I presumed it was a twinkie shake, so when it came out, I sent it back and ordered something else...with her giving me attitude and wondering why there was a problem.

This was a great hamburger, with a nice and thick slice of foie gras! The onions added a nice consistency and taste, but I didn't really notice the truffle mayo. The burgers here were coming apart as well, and it didn't pack the punch I've had elsewhere in town, but good overall! I'd say it might be a #5-6 on my scale!  4 stars!

It was built in 1927 and was billed as ""Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement."" It's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a ""photoplay"", but you'd also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. 

The grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. 

Let's face it fellow Yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you? 

Okay. 

I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! 

The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD ""The King Is Dead"" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached #1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called ""progressive rock"" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an Americana/Alt Country sound. So much so that the single ""Down by the Water"" reminds me of Firetown's ""The Good Life"" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that's another story). 

So it was no surprise that after doing ""The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3"", Colin Meloy told the audience ""I don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We're not a prog band anymore. We're a folk band."" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. 

There was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee's accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song ""Rox in the Box"". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song ""Rise to Me"". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! 

But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul. I should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the Decemberists. Now you know where I get those genes from. 

As I mentioned, Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. His father is the iconic Steve Earle (another one of my favorites). Justin gets his middle name Townes, from Townes Van Zandt, of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.",2011-04-22 22:13:28

I was a US Marine stationed overseas on mainland Japan for three years. During those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of Japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.

The ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is FAR from authentic. 

The broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.

The biggest difference is the price. Here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?

90YRHRcOB4mJqTHaIQqXbQ,Uo5dPwoDpYBzOnmUnjxJ6A,SZzFdGOC3M8voFjdRgmXhg,2,2,0,0,"Tip # 1 - Do not go as a group of 6 people, you will be squeezed into a table designed for 4 people, even though you made reservations over a month in advance... 

Tip # 2 - Order the meats first, specifically, the beef and lamb items, they take forever to come to the table. I find that pretty shady for AYCE.

We had a pretty bad first experience at Shinta and it was unfortunate because we were celebrating Father's day and it would have been difficult to get a table elsewhere without a reservation. We had made reservations over a month in advance and they seated us at a booth designed for 4 people with an extra chair added to the end. The same booth next to us had 2 people seated there... When we explained to the hostess that this didn't make any sense, she had the audacity to attempt to blame us, and said she thought our reservation was for 5 people (Note: We never altered this reservation, it was always for 6 people. Your mistake is not our fault.); the manager eventually showed us another option and it was a table with 2 grills designed for 8 people, but we weren't allowed to have the second grill and they put up a wall to divide that table in half and added two chairs to the end to fit us. He did throw in a pitcher of watermelon juice to make amends... I would have preferred proper seating. 

Food - It was mostly good. We did the Angus AYCE. Be cautious of the lettuce, it's not the cleanest. Beef cuts are pretty limited here in comparison to other Japanese AYCE BBQ. 

Service - The servers were somewhat slow and forgetful but overall nice. 

I guess I would come back if I was craving Japanese BBQ and in the area but I know better places to go to instead, and I would never come back as a group of 6 people.",2018-06-19 17:05:55

-Coconut Seafood Curry: A lovely medium-spiced curry with fragrant basmati rice accompaniment. The portions of seafood were generous, and it was a very comforting main that didn't actually feel that heavy!
-Mango Panna Cotta: This was good but nothing to write home about. Very fruity, and a little on the heavy side. Really liked the water that came with it. I thought the portion was a little too large, where eating it becomes a bit tiresome.

I told her exactly that and I asked to speak to her manager. The manager was polite and told us she talked to her server and that she would make sure we would get another table with another server.

My overall experience was so-so but the food was pretty good. We went on Mother's Day. I believe someone in our group made reservations so there was no wait.

Here's how it went down from beginning to end.

1. We were seated at an ""extended table"" in an awkward location. Right near the front door and the ""extension"" seemed to be a small table that was shorter than the main table and tilted towards the floor the slightest bit so we had to be careful NOT to put anything near the join. Which was hard to remember because the whole shebang was covered with the same piece of butcher's paper (?).

2. Our drink order was taken. Drinks received soon enough but someone in our group had to ask for bread.

3. Food order taken. I applaud the staff for getting everyone's food out almost simultaneously. We were a party of nine or 10.

4. Wait staff was very attentive but forgot the side sauces some asked for.

5. Leftovers were boxed to go upon request but returned to the diners (me included) without a bag. Initially I thought they didn't HAVE bags. Then I noticed other diners exiting with bags so I asked and received.

(It just makes sense to me that a customer leaving one's establishment with... anything would be given that item in a BAG. A bag displaying one's establishment name or logo is also a means of free advertisement as I will re-use a good bag until it falls to shreds.)

6. The waiter knew to ask if  and how the bill should be split.

Peeve: The way their prices are displayed on the menu.

I want some place relatively quiet (I can put on headphones), not too busy or too many distractions (hate when the guy or gal sitting 2 feet away from you just can't stay still) , open until a half decent time (at least 9 pm), has power plugs, serves coffee and a decent snack. 

Starbucks you say? The one @ southdown is too small with people constantly coming and going (and it's dang cold in the winter there). The one @ South Common suffers similar problems. The one @ Dundas and Erin Mills is way too busy. 

Second cup? N/A

iCoffee (a nice little find I made in Clarkson) - great, but open til 5pm.

Enter Artisano.  

1) It's a bakery/cafe, so you get good food (priced around $10), half decent coffee ($2), and a variety of baked snacks ($2-5).  

2) It's big, so you can find your own little corner. Also big enough that you're not distracted by hustle and bustle (population density).

3) It's quiet, at least, quiet enough when you throw on a pair of headphones.

4) And there are plugs!

5) It's open til 9-9:30pm daily.

Its menu focuses mainly on mid to southern chinese cuisine and doesn't have a lot of northern chinese cuisine selections. Some of my favorite dishes there include: jade tofu, spicy fish, cumin lamb, and many many others.  I will have to warn you that they put a lot of MSG in their dish (just as any chinese restaurants in town) and you'll feel very thirsty afterwards.

Some of my bad experiences there include:
1) one time we ordered a vegetable dish. After we were almost done with it, I saw a blue rubber band on the plate... So my guess was they didn't wash the vegetable properly - they probably just rinsed them under the water and didn't even remove the rubber band. That was a little upsetting. So I talked to the manager and they took off the price of that vegetable dish from our bill.

2) One of the new waiters was very friendly, almost too friendly. He was joking about my last name but I thought that was very rude and insensitive and even immature of him. So I confronted him later and he sincerely apologized.

Husband and I both noticed we had to talk louder because the children were yelling around us.  We ended up leaving as soon as our meal was done.  I'm  not a fan of children screaming in my ear while they play games and I'm trying to dine.

I may have been spoiled by the first time, which was in New Jersey.  At that place I was able to customize it to the skies: choice of the regular pork broth, or chicken, or even vegetable.  Too salty?  ""No prob, we can do low sodium."" And I was able to have chicken or shrimp (can't remember which) instead of some fatty pork.

It wasn't that way at Monta.  What you see is what you get, complete with photos.  And since even as a kid I was nauseated by even the tiniest bit of fat on any meat or poultry, I couldn't stand the pork that was in the bowl and had to remove it.  I'll take a nice, lean piece of pork loin any time, but not the stuff that makes up the choices at Monta.  The broth was pretty decent, and I'm a sucker for noodles of any kind, but the ramen here will never be my comfort food.

650QSmmJ_MaF4WN1V_gFZA,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,1,1,1,"""Table 17 is the rare restaurant that's both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,"" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013.  That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.

I wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.

The kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.

A meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.

I've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.


Oysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.

We opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.

For our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).

The Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit ""salad"" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.

Our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.

Side dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.

As with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.

The message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.

Our meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17.",2014-09-10 13:50:35

Thankfully, we were served right away because we opted to be seated outside. It was windy and cold, but thank god they had covers that made prevented the draft from entering. 

The ambiance was romantic with many guests dining in with significant others. But this was also enjoyed by friends and family as the room was filled with muffled chats from everyone. 

Our server was overly friendly as she helped us order our food and checked on us pretty frequently. They really cared that your beverage is filled to the rim so they often came back to refill our drinks when necessary. That was quite impressive for me. 

We ordered the Chicken Pesto, Bolognese, and White Truffle Garlic Bread. 

Chicken Pesto: I thought the pasta was not cooked thoroughly which made me enjoy the chicken instead. But it was delicious overall. I've always thought pesto didn't taste much so I was happy to learn that they have a different style of pesto that had hints of flavor with this plate. It wasn't too salty and you can taste the hints of garlic with it. Delicious. 

Bolognese: Loved the cheese and the meat sauce that went with it. It was simple but heightened in another way as I enjoyed every bite of this meal. Would I order it again? Certainly. 

Garlic Bread: I've heard a lot of good things about this plate, but I wasn't too impressed by it. I understand it's made with truffle but that wasn't enough to give it that ""wow"" factor for me. I also thought the side of cheese was a little weird as I couldn't figure out if it was indeed cheese or butter. 

Also, serving the garlic bread was delayed as they gave it to the other table next to us. To our surprise, they apologized for the mishap and made a fresh batch, free of charge.",2018-01-21 15:40:05

The reviews seemed ok and I live close so I thought it would be worth trying even though I have several sushi places I usually am willing to drive to.  This meal was a complete waste of money.  I have had bad sushi before but never where it was spoiled and unable to eat it.  I sent my Amaebi back to the Chef and not only did the staff not find some fresh shrimp to replace it with they didn't even mention it again.  I didn't ask for it to be replaced as I was so turned off from it I don't think I could have eaten it if they did give it to me. Several other types of fish they served was smelly and fishy but just starting to spoil and still edible but not enjoyable.  The rice on the sushi was warm and the fish tasted like it had been unthawed.  I inquired about the rice being so hot and the lady told me the health department makes them do that.  I eat a lot of sushi and nowhere else have I found rice like this.  My daughter had chicken teriyaki and they gave her very little chicken and it was completely dried out and overcooked.  Waitresses seem nice when you sit down then tend ignore you when you want to order more but I could live with that if the food was ok.  Complete waste of time and worst restaurant experience I have had in Vegas in over 20 years of living here.  This place will be out of business soon.  If you can't even eat or slightly enjoy a meal it doesn't even deserve a 0.  My wife enjoyed her desert a lot and said the coconut tempura shrimp was pretty good but thought her sushi was no good.

The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the cafe has a cupboard of board games, a separate cupboard of magazines, 2 darts machine, an old jitz table and a few mah jong tables. 

The menu holds no surprises - your standard mediocre bubble tea options and quality reflects the same.  But of course the main attraction is the items listed above - and with the least expensive drink at $3.99, this is a great place to play board games with a bunch of friends. Unlike the famous Snakes and Latte, no additional fee is required to play board games. 

There are a wide variety of board games/card games here. While about half the options are Chinese games, there are still a lot of options ranging from your standard Settlers of Catan to a few zombie games. Since the cafe isn't really new, a few of the games look pretty battered but the few games I played were not missing any pieces. One of the card games I picked up was missing 1 non-crucial card out of a deck of 120, so overall I'm impressed. There's rarely anything to do at night in Markham so the cafe (with fairly late hours closing @1am Mon - Thurs) is great for the low price.

The douchey hipster bitches irritated me because they each took up an entire table (reserved for 2 or 4 patrons), and then proceeded to scowl and dart death stares at everyone else who was trying to talk or eat or make noise. LISTEN UP ASSHOLES, IT'S NOT A LIBRARY, SO DON'T GET PISSED WHEN THERE ARE NORMAL SOCIAL NOISES COMING FROM A PUBLIC CAFE. Besides, you are going to fail your exam/write something dumb on your macbook pro anyway, so either put your intellectual props away, or stop being an ass.

The bar itself is merely alright. Overall it's a decent enough place to sit down for a drink. It's location is just far enough from Yonge and Eg to avoid totally inflated food and bar prices, although Davisville isn't exactly skid row so prices remain what I'd deem as average.

If you weren't aware, you can easily miss the fact that there is an upstairs part to the bar. It's a little more unique but again it's nothing special and doesn't really have a ton of ambiance.

The food also lacks any special quality to it. I ordered a Kramers Burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger. The bacon was cooked perfectly as was the burger. Some nice crisp cheddar adorned the top of the burger and the lettuce and tomato were also fairly fresh. Good bun as well. What made it average however, was that the burger patty had an off taste to it. I can't describe it any other way but to say it tasted stale. I don't know how that's possible in a burger but it's what it was. On other occasions, I've had the wings and they were okay as well. Salvaging the dinner however, was the French fries. They were double fried and very tasty. The burger came with a side of chipotle mayo which was a nice touch for the fries (intended or not). 

Staff was very friendly. Our waitress was one of the only servers on our floor on St.Paddy's Day and she was extremely pleasant, smiled a lot and did her job well. The staff overall has been excellent save for one bartender the first visit who was surly.

Overall a decent enough bar. Clean, good drink prices and decent table space.",2015-03-18 19:46:20

The past couple of times the food has been inconsistent and sub-par. I always get the same items. The octopus and the scallops used to be to die for but not anymore. When I first had the octopus, it used to come in a very generous amount on a bed of greens. Now, I feel like they give you 4 small pieces mixed in with the salad and it's not as tender. The scallops used to be amazing but they were watery and lacked flavor the past two times we came. Also, the calamari has changed as well. It was chewy and they no longer give the same amount they used to with the fried lemons. I'm not sure if the chef or owner changed because we noticed several differences in the quality of the food. Needless to say that I think my days at honey salt have come to a halt. There are better places to eat at now. Quite disappointing.",2017-01-02 12:00:59

I have tried the basil rolls, pad see-eu, and masaman curry, and all have been outstanding. While I do not usually get tofu, theirs is delicious, and so I always choose tofu instead of meat at Basil.  Portions are large enough that you will likely have enough for leftovers.

You can expect a wait for lunch if you arrive after noon, so I recommend going a little earlier.  Service is extremely fast, though, and always attentive.

My family and I made reservations for 5pm, right as the restaurant opened for dinner. Good thing, too - the line of fellow diners waiting for dinner to start literally stretched out the door and down part of the sidewalk. The restaurant was full within minutes of officially opening for evening service. So yeah: reservations are definitely recommended here! 

Despite the place being full of people immediately from the start of service, we never felt neglected during our visit. The dining staff were prompt and efficient, as were the extra busy bartenders. I especially want to thank the staff for patiently explaining parts of the menu to my excited carnivore father. He was having trouble selecting an order and had a lot of questions, all of which were answered thoroughly.

He ended up ordering one of their specials at the time, while I opted for scallops atop a blue crab risotto; my brother the roasted chicken; and my mother the brussels appetizer. Everything was fantastic! The cuts of meat were tender; the main and side dishes alike were well and uniquely seasoned; and the meal as whole was expertly crafted and very deserving of the prices being charged for each plate. In addition to enjoying the samples from my family's plates, my risotto - despite being a bit rich - was such a tasty delight that I just HAD to eat every bite of it!

We all left full and satisfied, and all agreed that we would happily come back for a future special occasion. Thank you for the amazing birthday noms, guys!",2018-06-19 17:07:12

With pharmacies, it is with service and competent fulfillment of your 'script that the rubber meets the road.  I never got to do business with them, sadly, because of the following:

--2 bungled phone calls, one where I was placed on hold for 15 minutes and forgotten when calling in about having a compounded medication made.  The 2nd phone call, the tech who took the call couldn't answer my questions competently.
--Each time I spoke to somebody, the price for the Rx increased a few dollars.
--Finally I drove to the pharmacy to get more information in person, and had to wait while the counter person spent far too long socializing with other people who didn't appear to be transacting any pharmacy business.  I finally interrupted the party, and I was boredly given a 3rd price for the prescription - higher than the previous 2 quotes - and was told that the person who could answer my other questions was unavailable.  I asked if this person could call me upon his return, and was told I would have to call back.  I was handed a marketing pamphlet for my trouble.

Really good - they also have extra spicy tuna off to the side that you can add to the top of this. mm so good. the shrimp pad tai was really good also. Ooh and the orange chicken I had a piece and it was really good. 

I also tasted a piece of bamboo salmon or mahi mahi - I wasnt impressed at all. But the sweet potatoes were delicious. Probably the best I've ever tasted. They also serve wine- no riesling but they have chardonnay, cabernet sav, white zif, and you can tip the servers. The dessert line is insane! I didnt even taste the desert the 1st visit.

H - you are a terrific server, we felt most of the time that you were there just for us. You were ever present and always clearing our table, etc.
We dined on clam chowder (Fridays on sale for $7 a bowl as opposed to the reg. $10).
We also had calamari that was well prepared, tried some oysters that tasted just like the sea. Divine. And the side order of scallops. Yum, fresh, everything and served hot when it needed to be and cold when it needed to be.
Atmosphere was ok, strange mix of music. Spanish, reggae, classical.
One note - the manager at the front in the suit hovering at the hostess stand - we would have loved it if you interacted with your guests a bit. Feedback makes you all that much better and you would have learned how much we loved our food and our server.
Parking - validated at the Hyatt. Nice.

The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious, but it was kinda odd with the tub being in the shower, but still being separate. I wish I would have taken a picture so it makes sense what I am saying. The room was a little small though in my opinion, but it was pretty comfortable. There was all the cool electronic fancy doo da stuff in the room which was cool, but I really don't think the room was better than a room at the cosmopolitan or MGM signature

The casino was very nice and the cocktail waitresses were really cool and brought us shots of patron while we were gambling

The pool complex was really cool with a lot of pools and had a really fancy feel but not fancy to the point where one would feel out of place. The cocktail waitresses were really nice at the pool too and ask if you needed drinks

We lost our keys a couple time but the staff at the front desk had no problems giving us new keys and making sure we tossed the old keys. I did have an issue with being charged $20 for a bag of chips from the weight sensitive plates in the room, but they took it off when we checked out with no questions asked.

We sat for long period before we were able to flag down the owners son. But we hardly noticed since we were having such a great conversation. 

We were also fortunate on this visit to order off menu that delicious dish of Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce.  It was a reasonable $9.95, and a old favorite of mine. Sadly I couldn't make the same deal to get some Sichuan Won-Tons. Oh well, the Fried Pot Stickers for $5.95 were very good substitute!

Our appetizers were complemented by some Plum wine and LI Ice Tea.  My friend Marvin loves this place and so do we. http://www.yelp.com/biz/jade-palace-scottsdale-2?hrid=RRwVjbbyGOQSFkDY8VfAmA

Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Their Injeolmi bingsoo (Korean milk shaved ice with glutinous rice flour) was very good!! The powder is very flavourful and there were some Mochi as well. Sweetness of nice is just right and the ice was NOT MELTING AT ALL which is common at some other bingsoo places! We ordered a large and it was quite enough for the two of us. The decor is basic and nothing impressive. It was a little cold in the store but overall the experience is great. I am looking forward to come back again and try other flavours.",2017-03-27 23:04:22

I went on their grand opening day, which also happened to be my birthday! If you don't already know, if you hit What A Bagel on your b-day they give you a dozen bagels for FREE! It might seem like too many bagels, but those suckers freeze well. I especially like their ""everything"" variety. 

Anyhow, aside from my bagel swag, I had an egg salad sandwich on a bagel. For what it is it was way too expensive (almost $10 for a bagel sandwich and a drink). I feel like a bit of a B for complaining about the price after they gave me free food, but when it isn't your special day, that's a lot to spend on a bagel sandwich. 

The staff seemed quite disorganized, but as they had just opened I'm going to let that slide. I'll update my review when I'm next there. Bagel.

I feel like people can legitmately say there's a difference between Tex Mex and authentic Mexican.  Is there really an authentic Chinese food?  Is General Tso a real person?  All these questions...irregardless....

I love this place!  I think the shrimp rolls deserve the highest rating with a nice crispy outside and crispy cabbage inside.  My go to meal choice of Sweet n' Sour chicken is always fab.  I love that they put enough sauce on (which is a lot, so beware if you don't like a lot) that I can mix it up in my oh so healthy white rice...cough cough.  And I LOVE that they give you free tea and it's good!  I never use sweetener.  It's some sort of Jasmine blend and I always enjoy going with people that don't drink a lot because I usually drink it all!

And for realz, how do you beat the Lunch Special?  A choice of Egg Roll or soup: fried rice, steamed rice or brown rice and tea for $7.50.  Bam, full until....2...hours....later....But that's the joy of Chinese.  And boy did it taste good going down!

I ordered the rose/lychee green tea while my friend had the starry night with passion fruit and sprite. The medium size drink was filled halfway with ice and the large was filled 3/4 with ice.

I drive past it every day and know they are not open late so today was a day I could take advantage and go try their food for my first time. I had heard good things and also read some good reviews. I am not as much of a burger person as my husband so I had to bring him along too for an added opinion! We arrived, got one of the last parking spots (just a small little plaza, be prepped to park on the road) and in we went - greeted nicely and promptly. The place was cheery and bright, brought me back to the 80's with the Ms Pacman and Donkey Kong video games! We perused the menu at the counter and we made our first mistakes. When you find a place known to serve a good, fresh burger, why mess it up by ordering a ""novelty"" burger? I wanted to have a special burger for some reason and strayed from my tried and true lettuce, tomato, extra onion and ketchup. Sigh. So, starving and my eyes wild from the ample choices, I ordered the Fay burger that had 1 patty, fried mushrooms, fried onion, the regular fixins' and mushroom sauce. Did I NOT think that this would be a mushy burger? Sigh... so when the burger came, I had to eat it as fast as I could and any thoughts I had of taking half of it home with me were dashed. Just too messy and the lettuce in the burger would not have lasted the trip home due to the mushroom sauce. It was not a bad burger - at all - but as I was eating, I was craving fresh, crisp onions, crunchy lettuce and tomato and would have liked to have tasted the patty more. I messed up! The size of the burger was good, knife through the centre to keep it together. The sesame bun, just OK. I like mine a little softer. Boogie's boasts that they have 100% fresh burgers, Alberta beef to boot, this is a good thing. My husband had a Sam's burger that had 2 patties, signature red sauce, fried egg and the fixins'. He was not keen on the red sauce which was a mix of ketchup and relish. He wishes too that he would have kept the burger simple. We each ordered a small fry and we could have easily split one. I very rarely eat fries - when I do I want them to be very good but they were just average. We had a nice booth and the restaurant was not that busy so it was an enjoyable place to have a late lunch.

Going to a concert with my parents!  Hey, both Mom and Dad are Mellencamp fans too, so we made an evening out of it.   Once again, this is more of a concert review than a review of the facility.  Look out Rolling Stone Magazine!  

I'm sure most of you are familiar with Mellencamp's material, especially his 1980s stuff.  He started off as a young punk (but not a punk rocker) under the name Johnny Cougar, a name he always despised.  He had a minor hit back in the 70s, ""I need a Lover"" but had a breakthrough with ""Hurts So Good"" and ""Jack and Diane"".  By then he was known as John Cougar.  He hit his stride as John Cougar Mellencamp with the album ""Uh-Huh"" and his best known work, ""Scarecrow"".  He had a string of hit singles including ""Authority Song"", ""Paper in Fire"", ""Lonely Old Night"", and ""Rain on the Scarecrow"".  His last major single came in the mid-1990s, ""Key West Intermezzo"".  By then he dropped the ""Cougar"" name.

If you went to this show expecting to hear those songs, well you did get some of them.  But this time out, it wasn't about the hits.  Mellencamp's show began with a documentary on the making of his new CD, the stripped-down ""No Better Than This"" and last year's tour he did at minor-league ballparks (Wilco did the same thing this year).  
The new CD was recorded at the legendary Sun Studios.  About that documentary, I was wondering why the concert starting time was 6:30pm!

When Mellencamp & Co did take the stage, they went right into ""Authority Song"", but if you were expecting the usual uptempo rocker, were you in for a surprise!  They did a rockabilly version of that one.  He reinvented some of his other work too--a guitar and fiddle version of ""Jackie Brown"" and a honky-tonk version of ""Jack & Diane.""  

The new material got a work out too, and believe me it stands well with some of his best, even if it's a little stark.  ""Save Some Time to Dream"" is an amazing tune as is ""The West End"".

Artists like John Mellencamp and John Fogerty may not sell as many CDs as they used to.  But isn't it great to hear artists who still pay attention to their crafts and who still can write good material?  Instead of others who keep slogging through the same tired old hits year after year.

So not sure if this is an issue with the Yelp app or their system, but I recommend just calling to place your order. 

The curry itself is not bad but I do find other places to be better. Cons:
-small overall portion for the price 
-they gave us very little curry barely enough for the rice itself let alone the proteins 
-takoyaki was mostly dough and no mayo on top and had that freezer smell to it 
-the girl that packed our order threw the takoyaki in the bag and tied it up so tightly that the box flipped and it ended up looking real gross 
-they put the red pickles right into the curry for my meal while they put it on the rice for my friends meal, so my pickles were hot and soaked in curry which I did not like 
-they gave us sweet chili sauce for gyoza instead of  gyoza sauce??

This place is super close to my work so if I was craving curry I would come again but definitely not my first choice for curry.",2018-04-27 20:18:47

The restaurant has an upscale diner feel, with a sports television-filled bar, comfy booths and lots of tables for both one-on-one encounters and family outings. I loved the lighting, which was just right at not-too-bright, not-too-dim, and despite the construction currently surrounding the restaurant's streets, it's nice to have a downtown Phoenix view while you nosh.

My pal and I recently dined there and tried a ton of menu items, a great variety for both fans of the build-your-own-burger concept, as well as vegans and vegetarians. We started with fried dill pickle chips ($5), which came with a sweet apricot sauce. I liked the sweet and salty combination, and the pickles were fried to a great consistency, light and not greasy.

We also split a big caprese salad ($7.50), which came with marinated red and green tomatoes, red onion and thick slices of mozzarella. These two items alone would have filled us both up. I loved the green tomatoes, which is a unique touch to the tomatoes you usually get in a caprese salad.

The build your own burger process is the really fun part. Grab a sheet of paper outlining all your burger options, and fill it out, sushi-style. There's a housemade vegan option, as well as bison, turkey, chicken and tuna burgers. Get it with a bun (options include a vegan ciabatta and pretzel bun), or go bowl-style and forgo carbs. There are a dozen cheeses to choose from, 26 sauces to add, and nearly 50 toppings to pile on, including dried cranberries, quinoa and marinated artichokes. Premium toppings include an egg, bacon and chili. Add a side for $3, from shoestring or sweet potato fries, to seasonal grilled corn, and you've got a very filling meal - I couldn't finish a quarter of my burger and crispy onion strings combo after the appetizers.

For my burger, I ordered the vegan patty on a vegan ciabatta bun, with herbed goat cheese spread, house mustard, a lettuce blend, alfalfa sprouts, tomatoes, red onion and dill pickles. Although I added a ton to my burger, everything was portioned well-enough so I could hold it without a problem and cut it in half cleanly. The vegan patty was delicious, and I'd highly recommend my flavor combination if you're looking for a great veggie option. If you're vegan, there is also a vegan cheddar, which really made me appreciate how well The Counter is mindful of all its customers.

You can also build your own salad, or order a burger on their menu in a combination the restaurant has concocted. Besides a full bar, one of the other cool aspects to The Counter is that you can order an adult shake, a sweet treat with your choice of spirit or liqueur.
Besides the tasty food and welcoming ambiance, my pal and I thought our service was stellar, especially considering all the things we ordered. We received everything promptly and were checked on diligently, which we were really thankful for.",2015-08-19 21:25:23

I had driven and walked by Blue Star diner enough to know that it looked like my kind of place. Prices, no, not cheap but I have not really found ANY place in Calgary that feeds one cheaply! In ONT, we could get breakfast deals for $3.95 a person - do these places exist anymore? Anyways, I went early as there was a line up and I wanted to be a nice friend and get us a seat. The server was SO busy but had the time to greet me when he could and brought me and anyone who else in line wanted one, a coffee or tea. The diner is small and they count on quick patron turnovers to get the people in and out. Finally I was seated after about 15 minutes, my friend showed and I realised how HOT it was in the place. BUSY! My friend ordered the stuffed French Toast and she loved it, she said she would order that again. The hash browns on her plate looked so good but she was too stuffed to touch them and I refrained from stealing any of them somehow. Ha! I ordered a lunch type meal, that being the chicken club with avocado. I cut it in half right away to bring half home to my husband as he is the TRUE tester of a good club sandwich!!! I got the bean soup instead of fries and I quite liked it. $1 upgrade for that. Coffee cups never went below half without a refill from the staff and they were very accommodating, making sure that we had everything we needed. Of note - if you wish to have egg white with your meal (I originally wanted 2 fried egg whites, toast and hash browns) they will not do it unless the whites are scrambled. Ick, I passed on that, not for me. And not for any amount of money would I ever be able to choke down an egg yoke! What we did have to eat was very good and we will likely be back. Everyone else's plate in the joint looked better than the last! With tip and everything, $40. Not something I would partake in each weekend (as this cost of course did not even include a boozy drink!)  but the Blue Star Diner was what I would consider a treat. They do a great job!We left at 3:00pm and the line was still out the door! Oh and my husband gave 2 thumbs up on the half club sandwich!!!!",2011-11-30 07:41:43

There's just not enough modern Japanese snack houses in Markham...so when I heard there was a place serving Unagi Don tea time specials for under $6 during off peak hours... I knew I had to give this place a try.

First thing I realized is that their menu is COMPLETELY different from what's mentioned online. Most of the Moji offpeak lunch special items are a lot worse than they were before. They got rid of the Chicken Teriyaki and Takoyaki and replaced the dishes with cheaper options like edamame and (really little) tempura don. The Gyudon was still there though. Thank goodness.

But here's where the bad news gets worse. It takes me like 10 minutes to call down the ONE waiter who was working at the time. But if you thought that was bad... I waited over one HOUR to get the two specials I ordered. I thought this was ridiculous since literally everyone during that time frame was ordering the same thing. I saw five of my exact order pass me over the span of the one hour taunting me. To think there would be more staff working during the busy time... or at least try to cook the dishes a little more efficiently?

I was absolutely starving by the end of it all, and the food (although pretty decent) just wasn't good enough to make up for my long wait.

Now I actually like the concept, lots of meats, cooked well, full of flavor...And way over priced....

I love meat, beef, pork, chicken, hell give me deep fried budgie (google it Americans) in garlic and I would be happy.

So I am left conflicted, lots of good meat...for a price that's lets face it folks, in Vegas you can get a very good steak for, i'm sorry, but when these restaurants started showing up in Vegas dinner was $25 -$30, now they are $50 and up...Seriously, look long and hard at what you are getting, they just don't make sense...But I let the wife pick dinner...

So, after a quick ""no"", ""But you said I could pick"" conversation she headed of to groupon, where she came across a deal for this place....Plus she had a credit with groupon that covered the cost...

Ok meat plus a meal I had already payed for..Works for me.

Service was good, seated quickly, waiter friendly, diet coke delivered quickly, though the refill took time to come...

But it's the food you want to know about....Well frankly, the meal was ""free""...And I think we were charged to much.

The meats were dry, the fish were cooked to death, the shrimp tasteless.

The one saving grace was desert (yes we went to an all you can eat meat place and still wanted dessert, that should tell you something)...I had the tiramisu, the wife had the cheesecake, they were both very good.

Finally checked it out after reading a description of their January sandwich of the month, ""The Resolution"". This sandwich special is a grilled chicken breast with shredded kale, green bell pepper, pickled cucumbers, avocado and vinaigrette dressing on a bun. The sandwich was tasty combination of veggies and the chicken was juicy and tender. The other items ordered was a fried chicken breast and french fries. The fried chicken was tender inside with a crispy skin. The taste of the crispy skin was different than other places and was not my preference. The skinny fries were hot and tasty. The portion size was large enough for two people although the small size was ordered. 

The restaurant has a bright and comfortable feeling. Seating is choice of tables or booths. Orders are placed at the counter and the food is delivered to you. Except for the fountain sodas that are self serve. A server continuously makes the rounds checking your satisfaction and removing finished items.

There are many choices for chicken just like burgers. At Blue Ribbon it's all about the taste of the fried chicken. It's just different to what I prefer. I will keep them on radar for the sandwich of the month.",2016-01-30 19:13:53

Decent but not fantastic options: the golden and red beet salad (the citrus was a bit tart for my taste); mixed seafood ceviche (while this version is very good, the sampler trio at Lolita's Cantina is better -- see my previous review); and the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (too much goat cheese and not enough peppers).

Ordered:

Charred Calamari-  We are Calamari freaks and were definitely excited to try Comme Ca's interpretation.  The presentation in itself was already unique.  The squid was served whole (uncut w/ tentacles and all) in its' own ink alongside some crackling capers!  $15 for this and totally worth it!

Fries- The fries were pretty normal.. nothing spectacular about it that made it distinguishable from your typical french fry.  It was good, but I'd personally pass on this.

Slow Cooked Veal-  This was extremely good and just melts in your mouth.

Classic Bouillabaisse - This was basically a seafood stew where the base was a Lobster broth. This was the culprit of the missing star in my rating.  I feel that the description sounded amazing, but I just felt as if it had a missing element to it.  Definitely not worth the $35 price tag.


Egh, I wish I could remember which Wine we had.  It was really good. So good, that we finished the bottle with no problem!

If you have been to Texas before and have had REAL BBQ, this place pales in comparison but we were in the area and I had heard U Gotta Eat here had just done a taping at this restaurant. So it has to be good, right? 
Walked in a little after 5pm and there were only 2 other occupied tables. Got a booth at the top which is a really cute little area past the open kitchen. This place was clean and I liked the casual atmosphere and the lovely aromas coming from the cooking area. I like open kitchen style.
Service - lackluster. They lose a point here. The waitress would barely answer your question and flit off to wherever. It's not like she was busy.
We were counting on the food to be a hit. Not so impressed. :(
I ordered a rack of ribs so I could bring half home and I was really excited about the sides including the corn bread. The corn bread is said to be made daily. Not sure about that - it was underwhelming and cold. Would it be too much for them to warm it up a bit if they boast that they take the time to make it fresh? The rack of ribs was the smallest I had ever seen. Seriously, half of what you would get at Tony Romas, just to compare. I forget to mention to the waitress that I wanted baby back ribs and I got the defaulted St Louis Style (I was not asked either which I wanted). Fattier and NOT fall of the bone tender. I just wanted to cry! The bourbon maple sauce it came with was good but I had to ask for extra and the ribs do not come all nice and gooey and saucy. 
Also on the plate was a tiny potion of beans and coleslaw. Both not bad. The beans had a hint of spice to them which I liked and the coleslaw was decent. 
My chosen side was the mashed potatoes. I asked the waitress if the potatoes were real mashed or packaged prior to ordering and she stated that they were real, homemade with some added fluff filler. WTF? What does that mean? OK, I will bite, I got them. NOT real potatoes, I do not care what anyone said and they were not fooling me by dumping the oversalted gravy on top of them!
Ladies and Gentlemen, while this may sound like a heap of food, it was so not, it was ridiculous!
My husband got the 2 meat option which included a very small portion of brisket and a tiny smoked chicken breast. He was done eating in about 10 minutes or less. Sad. His ordered side was the burgoo soup - spicy, flavourful and warm. 
The woman seated next to me long after we had finished eating had the baby back ribs and I could overhear her saying that they were fall off the bone tender. I could not help that I felt that I had got ripped off. The waitress knew it was our first experience there, why would she not have made it the best meal possible for the same price to us? Why, to save the restaurant a few bucks on the crappier ribs?

The fresh loaf of warm bread was a very nice way to get the meal started. I always appreciate warm bread. As for the rest of the menu, well it ranged anything from average to not so great but they all had one common trait; a little bland and a little overcooked. My chicken breast was quite well-done and a tad too stringy but where it's lacking is flavour and a skin to be remembered. I couldn't tell the difference if this was 9 spice or 2 (salt & pepper). My fregola was very al dente, almost raw but charred. It added a little too much chewing and texture to the dish and I would imagine most probably had a difficult timing eating this stuff. Next we have the bison pappardelle where the bison had a lot left to be desired. A little dry, very bland and exceptionally stringy. I have to say this dish was a little amateur in it's execution. It was a sad dish to look at and taste. Last but not least the salmon and I don't have to convince you that it's bland. Though it was somehow tender unlike the former two dishes.

The dessert was well executed and not exactly too memorable. The space is quite nice, classy, clean and comfortable. As I had mentioned, our lunch took over 2.5 hours so I don't think I need to comment on the service, it's pretty self explanatory.

All in all a pretty forgettable meal and experience.",2017-02-09 21:42:20

This past Friday, I was almost denied entry by the bouncer who said no ""open back"" sandals were allowed and I wasn't allowed entry due to dress code policy. I was truly astonished. It's a hot day, and practically every pair of women's shoes in a sandal style are usually open back. I almost walked away before the bouncer changed his mind and conceded saying it appeared as if I had a heel on the back (uh, what?). I came inside and noted that several females were wearing shorts so short you could see butt cheeks (and I'm not hating - if you can pull it off, all the power to you). I think my sandals were a little bit more appropriate in that moment.

Secondly, friends decided to use the bathroom and learned the hard way that you can't get back in after doing so, and you're essentially redirected to the line. That's the first time I've ever heart of that rule.",2018-07-08 00:09:15

The mussel soup probably had like a good 20-25 mussels in there too. Is the soup base anything special? Naw. Are the mussels fresh? Probably the frozen ones.

We first walked into Yardbird to meet up with some friends after attending a convention. Upon walking in I was instantly impressed with their decorè. I am a huge fan of restaurants that make you feel like you walked into a completely different era or country. Onto their menu... the menu is a bit underwhelming as far as food options go if you are gluten free or vegetarian (me) but it was great for our group who all happen to enjoy flour and meat. When our server approached us she immediately went to clean the table rather than saying something along the lines of ""excuse me let me get this out of your way."" We also had to ASK for a menu rather than being handed one. When we were finally asked if we wanted something to drink, we responded that we wanted something non-alcoholic but she didn't list all the options and seemed irritated. I went ahead and asked if they had lemonade and luckily they did and they muddle the fruit and squeeze the lemonade fresh, so I was instantly sold.

I went ahead and inquired and she said ""I'm not sure when but we have a private event and I was told its last call now for food and drinks"" When I asked what time we would need to leave by she didn't know and would find out, but do we want to order? I went with their warm cheese and watermelon appetizer since I wasn't too hungry and the pictures of the salads on Yelp were underwhelming for the price. My boyfriend ordered the burger and mac and cheese as a side. Unfortunately the watermelon was so thin and light it wasn't rebought to even satisfy my moderately hungry stomach and it was too late to order anything in addition and we needed to ""rush"" to finish in time before getting kicked out for the close. Personally I think that anyone who shows up two hours before a buy out should be notified. Some of us like to sit, enjoy and communicate while we eat and drink, not rush through food in under an hour. Needless to say I left very displeased after this first visit. 

Second visit. 

Only a few hours later we stopped back in for the private event after hearing that a group of our new friends from the convention would be attending. I was not looking to drink but since there wasn't table service we went to the bar to grab something refreshing. I decided to go for a tea and was pleasently surprised that the bar back left the bar to the kitchen to fetch me this lovely tea kettle hot tea and entire box of tea bags to choose from. They also brought the kettle out with honey and a variety of sweeteners. 

Pros: 

-Ambiance 
-Unique Menu 
-Amazing Tea 
-Fresh Blackberry Lemonade 
-Great bar staff customer service even those who weren't drinking alcohol

Cons: 

-Limited gluten free options
-Poor server customer service
-Not enough notice that they were closing early 

All in all I would come back for the appetizers and tea but it's not likely that I would choose to eat here since there aren't many options for me and their salads didn't look appealing from the photos.",2017-10-25 01:58:54

Enter myself and two co-workers. We work close to Downtown and we stopped in at Stewart & Ogden for lunch. We were on the clock so we hoped service would be quick and there wouldn't be too many people. Luckily we came at a good time because there weren't many people there.

Ordered:
Ahi Tuna Sliders with Tater Tots: Grandly awful. The bread, although looking pretty was dry as a bone and tasteless. It was like cardboard. The teeny pieces of ahi tuna were so freaking salty I could barely stomach them. The slaw inside was unmemorable. The tots, while brought out warm and crispy were also REALLY SALTY. Just an overall failure of what could be a really great dish. They should take a moment and go have the Ahi Tuna Sandwich at Yard House to understand what these sliders should really taste like.

Tomato Bisque (by both my co-workers): They said it was good, and the presentation was really cute with little goldfish crackers.

Side of Fries: Salty. TOO SALTY.

Caeser Salad with added on Chicken: The salad looked blah. My co-worker had to ask for extra dressing, because although it was mixed in, there wasn't much. The chicken was dry and she said the Romano cheese had melted under the heat of the chicken. They didn't even bother to give the chicken time to cool a bit before throwing it on her salad.

Decor is odd. The yellow IKEA like chairs really throw me. They should be replaced to go with the rest of the restaurant which is like, ""chic diner"".

The problem is in the kitchen though. Honestly I would have sent my food back had I not been limited with time and on the clock for work. The food is simply not good. I really doubt I'll be back, but I'll keep an eye on the Yelp reviews to see if they improve any.",2013-12-07 22:47:47

I always get the same thing here, which is the taro milk tea, but without red bean. I prefer the taro milk tea here because they don't have chunks of taro in it, unlike their competitor (who I also like, just not their taro milk tea). I usually get the tapioca. 

I find that their teas are quite sweet, so 30% sugar is plenty even for a huge sugar addict like me. Now that it's winter I will get drinks without ice. When it get warmer I may get 50% sugar with light ice. 

I tried their pudding once and did not enjoy it at all. It tasted very herbal/medicinal for some reason, kind of like grass jelly. I will stick to tapioca!

With it's drop ceiling, the dining area is somewhat simple, though made interesting by the large wooden tables that still resemble trees. But there's no doubt that the food and cocktails are the shining star at Legume. The menu changes constantly, making it appealing to regulars who are foodies and not in need of having the same thing that they enjoyed on their last visit. The menu is about as small as it gets, usually with about five starters, five entrees, one or two salads and a soup. In addition, they try to source most of the ingredients locally, but also offer up some not-so-common fare. Real foodies are likely to love it, but your less adventurous friends may be a bit turned off. Their cocktails are great. Those who put themselves at the Mercy of the Bartender (literally, that's the menu item) are usually very pleased with what they get (and it's not always the same!). The wines by the glass are a narrow, but interesting field. I've found that whatever starter includes cheese tends to be a winner. The salads are usually quite good. I've found the entrees more likely to be hit or miss. They recently featured vegetarian fare, so I tried the Vegetarian Exposion (with Yellow Corn Grits, Garlic Scapes, Maitake Mushrooms, Roasted Cauliflower, Turnips, Pea Shoots, Salsa Verde and Morita Chile Aioli), which was very good, but not one of the choices that I'd run back for.

Huge disappointment since this is (A.) a 'beer co' and (B.) a 'Grayhawk' company -- you should carry local beer.  So we shrugged our shoulders and ordered food instead.  The menu was really disappointing but we found things to order.  When the food arrived, it was mediocre.  Not awful, but not delicious at all.  If it weren't raining outside, we would have left.  We finished lunch with a consensus that we'll never be back nor will we recommend this place.  Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers was much more fun, lively, and offered a better menu.  The decor of this new 'beer company' was confusing.  Subdued colors and accents (like a high-end coffee shop) and meals are served on tin trays (ala prison.)

This place has a Chipotle concept, but with Indian cuisine. You pick either burrito or bowl, type of protein (lamb, vegetarian tofu, or vegan tofu), type of rice, then you can turn it into a combo if you'd like. I got a tofu burrito on wheat tortilla with lemon brown rice and fries. My brother got a lamb burrito on wheat with brown masala rice. We also got mango custard and special sauce on the side for our fries. They only had 3 small tables on their patio which were all occupied, but I didn't mind because I love having picnics anyway, so we went down the street to a park and had a nice picnic. 

Both burritos were very flavorful. The veggies, rice, and meat/tofu went together so well. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the burritos. The fries were perfectly crisp and seasoned. My brother ended up stuffing his fries in his burrito and eating it like that. I had mine on the side with the special sauce which was almost like a tzatziki sauce. Either way, the fries were yummy even by themselves. 

I will definitely be back and I'll probably try out a bowl and some veggie samosas next time. $10 for an organic well balanced meal with a side and drink really isnt a bad deal at all!",2016-03-17 21:42:47

It is also a great place for dinner before or after a movie at Town Square. The main dining room has high ceilings with white fabric billowing across, while the private dining area is separated in a replica/ re-construct of the colloseum. 

My boyfriend and I ALWAYS order the  ""quattro"" bruschetta, which  allows the sampling of several varieties, including roasted red pepper and mozzarella and sliced steak with gorgonzola, arugula, fennel, tomato and Italian dressing. There is always one item of the quattro that change. 

A main salad that is a particular favorite of mine is the steak salad. The steak slices are prepared the same as the one used for the bruchetta. The dressing is incredible as well. I have also tried a chef special, which was a scallops with pasta. This may sound very generic, but the scallops were done so well that I now ask if they ever have it available. They do, however, have a great substitute, whichis the scallop and shrimp risotto. This platter is amazing. If you are drinking their chiantis or cabernet sav. it will help bring out the spice of the meal. 

I am a huge fan of desserts, and for me, Brio does not disappoint. One of my favorites is the panna cotta, which is served in small espresso cups filled with the panna cotta, and a small amount of shortcake at the bottom, drizzled with strawberry syrup.  I have also tried the tiramisu, which is great as well. And yes, I have had two servings of dessert during one meal

I am not interested in all you can eat or big sushi boats so I will have to investigate the rest of their offerings.

Update - I did check the menu and they do have some take-out combos that look like they might be a good value. Stayed tuned...",2016-01-31 00:55:34

The sandwiches are okay but definitely overpriced.

The lounge upstairs is pretty small. With just 10-15 people I think it might start feeling crowded. Bongs and vapes are available for rent. No charge to get in but you have to buy something. The lounge was empty the few times I went. No atmosphere.

The Hawaiian shirts are borderline roundhouse kick to the face material.

I had to speed shop with Roxy waiting in the car. I just grabbed everything Joe brand(which i notice is pretty much edging out all the other brands). Gloucester cheese, vegan slices, exotic mushroom pizza, veggie breakfast sausage, lots of bread and the awesome cinnamon twists all went in the cart. I checked out the much recently touted Simple Times. If it came in pint cans, bought. But i don't collect 12 ouncers. So i settled on Mission Street Blonde Ale for 6 bones. 

Then came the capper. My ultimate F.U. to the unindustrialized world that needs my money just to eat.  I entered yuppie overdrive and bought some sushi to share with the dog. Take that, starving peasants. I'm no sushi expert. I just got maki made with imitation crab. I thought lobster might be a bit much.

The food was perfectly fine, but if you care about what you put into your body, stay far away from the nutrition info! Seriously, the ice cream scoop-size of butter that they served with my French toast was absurd. Is it humanly possible to use that much butter on three little pieces of bread?

I digress, though. If you're looking for a traditional, heavy breakfast, Bob Evans can fill that need. The staff at this location was nice, handling our friends' baby with the type of care that you'd expect from a family-focused eatery. The food came out quickly, and the quality was good for the price point, and we were out of there in no time, without ever feeling like we were being rushed along.

The salsa has a nice zip to it; I can't take really spicy stuff and I loved it, and my husband who craves nuclear-level spicy loved the salsa, too. My 9-year-old son, who is autistic and not one much for commentary, declared, ""These chips are really good.""

I had The Winner Salad. Yum! Great size for a salad, not too big and not too small. The turkey pieces are actual thin cut turkey breast and the salami is awesome. Some places skimp on the cheese, but they served up lots of soft cubes of fresh mozzarella. The vinaigrette was lovely and fresh. If anything, the bread served on the side seemed very bland in contrast,

Canyon creek restaurant is listed as a contemporary steakhouse.  Came here on a Wednesday around noon for a Winterlicious lunch.  Had to wait in line at the front desk for around 5 minutes.  Because the restaurant is below ground level lighting was very dim.  The modern decor is a mix between sports bar and lounge. 

Upon arriving to our table, each had cutlery, menus, glasses of water and a candle (with real flame). Items on the menu had a mix of western and Asian food which is a surprise.  Service was friendly but was slow in getting all our courses.  Restaurant looked to be about 80% full.  Was hoping to finish lunch within 1 hour but it was 45 minutes longer.  They were nice to give us extra bread when asked though it took about 30 minutes to get it and we were finishing up our mains.  

Candied Atlantic Salmon served with golden beets, citrus segments, pickled Bermuda onion and tangy horseradish crème fraiche.  Was the best dish I tried for this lunch.  Each bite had a different yet enjoyable taste.  Would highly recommend this dish.

Vietnamese Roast Beef Pho rice noodles in a rich and spicy beef broth with Thai basil, fresh bean sprouts and crispy wonton.  Friend said the beef was good but everything else didn't remind her of pho.  She still enjoyed it.

Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich crisply coated, topped with buttermilk jicama slaw, cilantro, chipotle mayo and jalapeño.  I tried a piece of the chicken and seemed dry but the fries were good.

Peach Crumble juicy peach chunks smothered in cinnamon brown sugar streusel and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  My friend said this dessert was realy good.

Salted Dark Chocolate Ganache decadent double chocolate with lemon zest, crème fraiche and a soft oatmeal crust.  Looked like a chocolate bar but tasted like chocolate mousse. Wasn't too sweet or bitter.  Portion size was small.

Carrot Cake made in-house with creamy molasses icing, caramel and candied pineapple.  Had a veriety of textures which I liked.  The flavours were average.  Probably wouldn't get this again.

Some food were better than others.  Most items I tasted were average and only item that stood out was the candied Atlantic Salmon.

They were accommodating with my lactose intolerance, which I didn't expect with a fixed winterlicious menu! They offered the lobster roll on lettuce instead of the regular bun that contained dairy. The portion of lobster was pretty small though.

I recommend: pad thai, top it with extra peanuts, bean sprouts and CHILE sauce mmm, the panang is outstanding with white rice, yummy sweet potato tempura.  Kalbi is HUGE.

The ambiance of this restaurant is your typical Cantonese restaurants in Chinatown. Nothing fancy, but quite clean and tidy. Pictures of food on the wall. Wait staff is very helpful. 

First lunch, we ordered:
1. Spicy beef slices -  $3.99. Beef is slightly tough, but otherwise an excellent dish. If the beef slices were soaked in the porridge, it is softened a lot. I will rate this dish a B+. 
2. Jelly fish - $3.99. Good tasty dish for appetizers. A solid A-.
3. Onion Pancake - $3.00 . Another solid B+.
4. Meat Ball  Porridge - an excellent bowl of porridge.  A solid A. 

Then for dinner, we ordered:
1, Scallion Crab - a super dish. One of the best crabs I have had. An A, no ifs or buts.
2. Broccoli in white wine sauce - another solid A.
3. Spicy beef slices - a repeat from this morning. 
4. Steam Bleeker Fish 荀殼 - We made an error on this. This type of fish should be pan fried and not steamed. If it were steamed, the fish meat texture will be too mushy. Not an issue with the cook. Still it is not a great dish. 
5. Princess Chicken ( 貴妃雞 ) --   too tough but when we were asked how the dishes were, we indicated to the waitress and this dish was not charged. This dish would have gotten a D+.

Both lunch and dinner were served with house soup -- Cantonese soup. Rice comes with the entrees. Tea is without question, part of the meal. 

A very enjoyable dinner place. If you like Cantonese seafood, you will like this place. 

I have a rough time to give any Chinese restaurant a 5 star, but this one comes close to it. But because of the ambiance, because of the fish dish, and also because of the chicken dish, I lowered it to a 4 star. Although, I can be talked into giving it a 5 star.",2016-04-23 18:58:48

I really like this incarnation from a solid restaurant group.

Bourbon and Bones on one side and CBCB on the other make a trifecta on this block.

Ambiance is cool and casual, wood, stone and concrete everywhere, the ropes are out of place but the place is relaxing and nice.

We sat at the bar and I have to say the prices are so fair that I think I could be a regular here, service was certainly good enough. I really liked that management was visible and worked close assisting the staff. One of the cooks held our door on the way out and didn't miss the thank you's and goodnights.

Tasty drinks and real good food make this a winner and a must stop when in the area. With the ultra casual Cold Beers and Cheese Burgers on one side and the Ultra sleek and pricy B&B on the other, this place is one great Mama Bear.

To be clear: there will always be some issues, this is natural; although, the main problem at Life Is Beautiful Music & Arts Festival is that they don't seem to be insomuch as trying in some areas. They are advertising in mass to the masses, and most people go to just one concert a year, so this would be the time of their lives no matter how mediocre it was put on. 

First, my biggest gripe from the initial review in 2013 was the lineup. Boy was it shitty! Of course this is somewhat subjective, although my three-pronged test of (a) unique bookings; (b) once in a lifetime collaborations; and, (c) memorably factor among the haze of all other events was certainly not met. 

Year two included two hip hop nights (headliners) and one seldom-to-perform subheadliner  (Lionel Ritchie); the third and best headliner was the soon-to-be-inducted Foo Fighters. All in all great: this year saw an expansion in the length of the festival as well as the festival grounds. (And police roaming around.)(Is the latter just a natural ""improvement,"" or related to the genre headlining two of the nights? Only the decision-makers can say.)

So why the downgrade of a star if the headliners are superior and that was complaint number one from the inaugural year? 

Well ...

Speaker lectures
You book Pussy Riot in an absurdly small capacity venue? Are you serious? You are lucky that their followers are peace-loving; had it been Rage Against The Machine ....

Water points
Where in the bloody fuck are they? They appeared to be significantly increased (perhaps three times more than 2013?), but it still not enough. Bottled water was decreased to 3$, but that is still 50% more than Coachella's 2$ bottles. 

Ferris wheel 
No single riders is a preposterously offensive policy. I heard of this from someone who was simply attempting to finish the application bingo card thing. The signs say 5$ per person. 

Art
What was great the first year changed into a somewhat mediocre affair in the second. Gone are the festival-goer driven installations like the heart that is now in front of Container Mall, and the wall of bricks who seemingly are kept in storage throughout the year. This year you could draw or sign a banner again, and draw on a balloon. (Pesky balloons that would block the view of the stage for those behind them. Genius.)

Food
It looked good. I did not partake in buying any this year so it will not factor in my review. Go to others for that: I am here for the music. 

Music
Best of 2014: Matt & Kim (Western stage)
Best of 2013: Smith Westerns (Red Bull® bus)

After Coachella installs a V.I.P. area -- which is ridiculously unfavoured by the general festival-goer -- LiB turns around and adds one to the Downtown (main) and Ambassador (outdoor) stages? Seriously? Take a wild guess as to who was in the V.I.P. area at Coachella earlier this spring apparently. 

Instead of attending festivals and borrowing from their absolute most shittiest idea, Rehan should attend Bonnaroo and learn how they run the comedy tent (so the same system can be applied to the lectures). At least borrow good things from other festivals.

Service:
excellent.  our waiter was always around while we were looking through the menu to give us suggestions and answer any questions and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  drinks were always full and extra sauce was brought out fast

Atmosphere:
a little casual and kicked back feeling, but still a little more fancy than most casual places just due to how it felt in the restaurant probably because of the lighting and the layout

Food:  (the most important part, right?)
I will start out by saying that if you have ever been to Unami, it is very much like that, but i felt it was even better.  I got the gold standard burger, and it was very good.  the patty had that great fluffy texture and not super packed like at most burger places which made it extra juicy.  the tomato mix they put on it made it very much like bruschetta and was a nice change from just a plain old tomato.  the arugula on it added a nice bitter taste to contrast with the tomato and meat, along  with the bite from the goat cheese cheddar that they put on.  just to throw it out there, the goat cheese threw me for a loop because i am used to goat cheese being very soft like it usually is, but the goat cheese cheddar on the burger was a pretty hard texture, almost like a parmesan but it still had that amazing goat cheese taste.  the bun was to me a standard type bun that you would expect at a gourmet burger place, but it was toasted just right and soaked up the juice from the burger patty very well.  I also got an order of the shoestring fries which were seasoned perfectly that i didn't even bother asking for anything to do them in (i usually dip my fries in blue cheese dressing).  the fries were very crispy since they were pretty thin, but salted perfectly and there was a decent sized portion of them also.

the only thing that wasn't super awesome to me was the prices (i believe the gold standard was around $17) but for typical vegas prices, it isn't too bad.  and considering it was bigger and better than unami for around the same price, it isn't that big of a deal.

I was unable to finish it so I took half home for steak salad the next day.  The steak was very enjoyable sliced thin and served cold on a salad the next day.  Service was very good.  Atmosphere, for my taste, is way too kid friendly.  I prefer not to dine surrounded by fussing children.  This is what I'd classify as a family oriented steakhouse.  Unfortunately, though the price and product are both quite good, I'd rather pay more and go to a proper steakhouse where there are not lots of kids.

We waited about ten minutes for a table, and then received our banchan.  I wish they had more, but the potatoes were yummy and the kimchi was also solid, not too acidic and the right amount of flavorful.

For starters, we had the dukbokki and the kimbap.  The dukbokki was hot, had a little kick of spicy, and the sweetness wasn't overdone. As for the kimbap, I really enjoyed the consistency of the rice and how warm it was, a super satisfying dish.

For mains, the seafood jungol was a little bland for me; it was a lot of spicy but lacked salt. The beef bulgogi was extremely tender and one of the stars of the meal. The jambong was the perfect hot soup for a cold winter day; it was like a more flavorful jungol that was slightly less salty with noodles that were kind of like udon, but slightly thinner.

I ordered medium wings and they gave me an order of hot. That wasn't a big deal. Accidents/human error happens. It was the way the MANAGER, of alllll people, handled it. I ordered my wings about 20 minutes before my cousins ordered theirs. As I took the first bite, I thought, ""Wow, these are really hot for medium,"" but I kept eating because I didn't know better. By my second wing, I'm sweating and thinking, ""These can't be their medium. They are way too hot to be medium."".....so I ask my other cousin to try a wing. He agreed that they were extremely hot and that they must have accidentally given me hot. His sister and her husband dipped their finger in the sauce and were like, ""Whoa, you need to say something because they probably gave you hot by accident."" By this point, 2 and a half wings had been eaten. Just before the MANAGER came to give us another order of wings (that my cousin ordered LONG after I ordered mine), my other cousin and her husband also tried the sauce. She said the medium didn't taste like mine. So....I asked the manager if I had an order of medium or did they accidentally give me hot. He looked at my wings for less than 2 seconds and said I have the medium. I said, ""Are you sure?"" He said yes in a very irritated voice. So I questioned again and asked him how he knew. He said that I didn't have a red toothpick.....so I pick up the red toothpick in my tray and say, ""This one?""  After he saw, instead of taking blame, he said, ""Oh, then you must have ordered the hot."" I said, ""No, I didn't order hot. I ordered medium. What happened?"" Again, he places blame on me and says, ""Oh, then you grabbed someone else's order at this table."" He said it in such a way like he was not going to do anything about it because it was my mistake. During this whole time, I am remaining calm and being very polite. My cousin could not believe the way he was handling the situation with such an attitude so she gets involved and we all say that nobody at our table ordered hot. I couldn't hear what he said to my cousin, but I see him nodding his head no and shrugging his shoulders like, ""Sorry for ya"" kind of thing. That's when I ask for our waitress because she was very kind and I KNEW she would rememeber that I ordered medium, as she was the one who advised me to do so. Again, I can see him annoyed with me, as he's asking her what happened and he's just hoping she's going to prove me wrong.....except she doesn't. She tells him yes; I did order medium and that nobody at our table of 13 ordered hot, and that yes, it was Zipp's mistake. He was very unhappy to take the wings back and I could tell that he thought I was lying, and it was as if he thought I just wanted free wings. We still gave the waitress a good tip because it wasn't her fault that the manager was so awful, but we just couldn't believe that the manager was so, so rude.

Island Foods is not the best by any means, but it is decent. The beef patties are delicious, and so are the doubles, but the jerk chicken is not that great. Usually one would say big chunks of white meat are a good thing (if you're trying to eat healthy), but good jerk chicken normally consists of various cuts of the bird, giving it more texture and flavour. I found Island Foods' jerk rather boring. You definitely need that oxtail gravy and hot sauce for the rice as they are the only things giving it any flavour. Can't say I'm a fan of the chunks of cabbage mixed in there either. This was my fist time there in a long while, but if I recall, the roti is quite good. Service was very friendly and prompt.

I would come back in the summer to give their ice cream to try.

I like the decor in this place, which is very clean and simple and bright.

Also sometimes they tend to sell out of their more popular items (I went around 2 PM on a Sunday and they were out of their vanilla mille cake and something else.) I got their chocolate cake and it would definitely be well-received by a chocolate lover - it was very smooth and rich, and had these little crunchy pieces in it that added some extra texture. It was tasty, but didn't stand out to me as being particularly unique. I also got a sea salt and cappuccino cookie, and that I really enjoyed - the flavours were quite unique and the cookie was slightly chewy, which I liked.

As my friend hadn't yet arrived, I decided just to watch and wait at the hostess stand...try to assess the sitch.

I ordered the minestrone soup, grilled salmon filet, and tiramisu. I also had the house white wine.  Let me start off with the minestrone soup -- this was a very big disappointment. The soup had far too many vegetables and was too heavy. Other places serve very light minestrone soup, which I prefer. This one is only good if you really like spinach and carrots overpowering the flavor of your soup. However, the grilled salmon filet made up for that experience. It was absolutely delicious, perfectly soft, and the lemon cream sauce added the perfect flavor. It was also served with a side of alfredo linguine with mushrooms, which was a very light for an alfredo dish.  The wine and tiramisu were both nice, however, I definitely felt that it was a pricey menu.  But I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience in the private dining room, which was worth the splurge.",2017-04-08 04:42:01

There's not many great Italian restaurants in Vegas, so my boyfriend and I end up eating here at least once a month!! It's in a business park/strip mall type of thing but don't let the location fool you!! When you walk in, the ambiance is both modern and cozy. It's not super fancy, but it's nice.

You get complimentary bread basket with some chimichurri. It's ok. I'm not crazy about it, which works bc I always need to save room for the rest of the meal!!
We always get the same appetizers - The bruschetta and the calamari!! Both are delicious!! I always add a tiny bit of balsamic to the bruschetta then it's perfect. The calamari is absolutely delicious!! It's hard for us to ever try anything else because it's just so good!!

For my entree, I usually try to order something from the specials but when I can't decide on one, I usually resort to the Pollo Sorrentina, which is on their permanent menu. OMG - it is AMAZING!! It is a sauteed chicken breast in a white wine sauce, topped with prosciutto, fontina cheese, and mushrooms. It comes with a small portion of steamed veggies and roasted potatoes. For $16, it is a GREAT meal! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I never have room for dessert since I always leave here beyond stuffed, but my boyfriend always manages to make room for the tiramisu, which he claims is the best he's ever had in the 20+ years of eating tiramisu!! so I guess it must be good :)

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in search of a great italian dinner!!",2012-01-03 19:50:30

In many ways the quality of GTA Chinese Dim Sum is tops in Eastern Canada followed by Montreal.  Alternately, you'd have to go out west.

This is a no frills dim sum place and the food does not disappoint.  As in my previous reviews on dim sum the litmus test consists of three staples that a restaurant must not, cannot, and should not fail.  The holy trinity is Har Gow (shrimp dumpling), Sui Mai (pork dumpling), and Sticky Rice in lotus leaf.

In short, Rol San passes with flying colours as the flavours are on the mark as is the texture.

Keep in mind this is your typical plastic over the table, no nonsense Chinese restaurant.  If that turns you off then the place is not for you.  Otherwise, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.

Since we have an office here  I was able to try this place out and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. 

Service - from a technical point, the service was challenged at best. Slow, inconsistent, forgetful, disorganized. However I quickly overlooked this and give them a solid 4 star!  Why???? Because from the host/ hostesses at the entry to the server, wine guru and the manager, they know that they are staffing up and that the kinks are being addressed. Their attitudes and focus are 5 star and their attitude is fantastic. So in this regard I this gonna be great. 

Food - we all enjoyed it. The menu is your typical steak house fare with hamburgers, pasta,  salads, chicken and different steak options. I was excited to see prime rib in the menu also!  I used my special test which I grade all steak houses. I ordered a Filet Mignon Blue, which is both very rare and difficult to make tender and melt in your mouth. Here, they did an awesome job as it was very, very tender!  

My colleagues all enjoyed their steaks which was a Steak Oscar and a New York Strip. 

Beverages - great wine selection and I love the wine gurus who assist in the selection of the wines. The reds are laid out from light to heavy and this is an awesome way to choose wine for someone that is a novice like moi. 

Ambiance. - 5 star for sure. The entire feel is a bit of a hip and happening place. Everyone is enthusiastic and very attentive. Dressed to kill or fashionable, everyone looks ready to hit the nightclub. As a guest you can be casual or more upscale, I have seen everyone from dressy to shorts and flip flops. This is the best as it is not pretentious and your experience is personal. 


The patio- the outdoor seating is an amazing  addition and I was fortunate to enjoy it on a summer day where the humidity was low, a slight breeze and cool. The day before this it was hot and humid and wet. That would not have been fun. They do have heaters for the cooler months and I wonder how that would be. My experience was that it was just right!

Anise Tapas & Grill has a bit of an identity crisis, but if you're looking for a spot that offers up Tapas, Moroccan, Spanish, Interesting Egg Rolls, Mediterranean, and Israeli Kosher Items, then Anise may be an option for you. I didn't mind the variety, though it requires several visits to get a sense of the variety of flavors. The real identity dilemma is about the space and value. Anise offers a beautiful atmosphere that you pay for by way of over-priced items.

I had take-out from here once...felt rather underwhelmed, but was coerced back with a two-for-one offer. Altogether, I tried the following items:
Drunken Avocado Empanadillas
Duo Hummus
Atun Tartare
Moroccan Fish Tajine
Pargiot Skewer
Jambalaya Spaghetti
Truffle Wild Mushroom Pappardelle

There wasn't a lot of redemption with my 2nd visit. In fact, as I paid the bill my exact thoughts were, ""It's a good thing I'm not paying full price right now."" There was also nothing I had that would entice me to come back. To be fair, nothing was horrible either...just nothing good enough to cause me to return, even with an offer.

Despite it being in a small yet intimate theater, Vegas the Show does a wonderful job of taking you back to vintage Vegas. All the singers have fantastic voices and the dancers...wow! I must not forget to mention the live band accompanying the singers. The production starts and ends in the historic Neon boneyard because of course that's where all of Old Vegas now resides. I would say that the best part of the show was the end when they do a video montage of Vintage Vegas and the changes it has gone through all while David Villella performs Elton John's Rocket Man...phenomenal!

I highly recommend this show to anyone into classic Vegas & it's past performers. It was highly entertaining and engaging, from the twin tap dancers Sean & John to the magic acts of Joseph Gabriel. Overall, it was well executed for being a big production on a small stage. From the costumes to the choregraphed moves, it was definitely worth dedicating almost 2 hours to.

Just remember that this is still a buffet and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. If you're looking for high quality sushi then why are you at a buffet?",2010-03-14 22:46:01

The employee didn't even bother turning the cup upside-down like they normally do at other locations. I can't believe I spent $5 for something I didn't even bother eating. At first I thought it was only the top layer of ice cream, but it was the whole so called ""blizzard."" Definitely not coming here again and I can see why this place has such low reviews.

If you're looking for a hip, contemporary spot to grab a nice dinner before a night out in the town. Then this is your spot to grab your girls or fellas and come out for your not so usual loud, music bumping dinner to get yourself hyped to go paint the town red. Couples order room service or go to Scarpettas at Cosmo for the romantic feel. I highly recommend this place for some good eats with a group to set the mood for the night. Perhaps even, a great way to unwind from a long day at the convention with your mentors! Every STK has their own DJ in the mix to set the tone! 

I came here with a group of 8 for a friends birthday on a weekday. Ive always seen this place around however never really had the desire to come. Like I noted above its great for groups and definitely not your old fashion kind of steakhouse. I'm not sure what fell through the cracks with my experience but for our $1100 tab I expected a bit more. More customer superior customer service, more flavor even if it meant more $. It could've been the server who wasn't as enthusiastic and accommodating as the $160+ added on gratuity he was granted hence the size of our party. On to the more Yelp appropriate opinions, the food was mediocre. I never pass up Mac n Cheese with lobster from any almost any where but the cheese here was equivalent to box made Kraft Mac & Cheese and well I'm more of a Velveeta type of girl if we're talking box Mac & Cheese. It was gross and of course hardly any chucks of lobster. The steak was made to perfection and I wish I would've tried a couple different sauces or rubs for the lovely charge of $2 but passed it up. The Yukon mashed potatoes were ""basic"". The pot pie mushrooms were delicious. We order 5 appetizers and they all were bland. Steer away from the shrimp ceviche and beef tartare and beef carpaccio but do order the lobster tail and bite size oysters! Overall, it was just average! Maybe for another birthday or event I'll try it out again... Just maybe.

P.S. 
I heard the sweet potato donuts here with Nutella are out of this world. They were out last night so I can't confirm or deny it. I might have to come for that too and the bread was something to rave about.",2016-06-23 01:08:18

To start I had the lobster Mac and cheese.  It was so good!  The portion looks small but looks can be deceiving.  It was just enough.  The dish is very rich and creamy. Spruced up comfort food.  The chunks of lobster were just right and the drizzle of truffle oil was a perfect match to balance or add to the rich flavors.  
For my entree I had the crab cakes. Those are the largest crab cakes I have ever seen at a restaurant. They were perfectly seared with nice delicate flakes of lump crab meat within.  I could only eat one, that's how enormous they were.  Both served alongside a chickpea mash which was deliciously citrus and garlicky.  A nice long half of a grilled zucchini squash topped with micro greens was balancing on top of both crab cakes.  
Lastly, for dessert I chose the banana split.  I was so full by this course that I was unable to fully enjoy it as I could.  However, I stuffed down as much as I could because it was so good.  Banana bread topped bananas topped with a vanilla and a chocolate scoop of ice creams drizzled with chocolate fudge and passion fruit glaze topped with homemade whipped cream topped with a cherry all in a cute martini glass.

I rarely, if ever, choose to eat at Italian restaurants. Reason being, I eat far too much Italian food at home. BUT (!!!) -- I was really impressed with Lago. 

Service was pretty darn wonderful. The staff went out of their way to acommodate us. We had a pretty large group of about 16/17 --- I didn't count. I was too distracted with the lovely company and the wine I was drinking. They set us up in the Carriage House with the tables arranged in a big square. What a neat idea! We were all able to see each other and hold conversations with every person in attendance. Nice touch! I was also glad that I could personally thank our server and shake his hand at the end of the evening for putting up with us. 

The food --
Beef Carpaccio: Delicious. I was trying to restrain myself from piling each piece of beef into a pile and shoving it all into my mouth at once. 

Gnocchi: Lobster, truffle, sweet corn, basil and roasted tomatoes -- it was heavenly. I was surprised by the amount of lobster on the plate. Flavor explosion. The pasta was so delicate. I was never a fan of gnocchi. Now I'm a convert. 

Roasted Brussels Sprouts: Dare I say it? *gasp* They were better than Michael Symon's fried version.  (OMG, food nerds are going to be coming outta the Yelp woodwork to attack my shizz!!!) 

Goat Cheese Creme Brulee:  I usually order creme brulee anytime it's on a menu. I sorta have a thing for it. This one was one of my favorites. Any dessert that can do well with goat cheese as an ingredient gets a thumbs up from this girl. 

Overall, exceptional evening, in my opinion. Thank you Lago!

The reviews for this place have been all over the map, with some folks praising this place up to high heaven and others making this place sound nothing short of awful. Hence, I've always been a bit skittish about taking Sheila F. here on a date. However, after our plans to have dessert at Lolita got derailed tonight, we finally decided to hit up The Chocolate Bar.

This place is located in the Old Arcade downtown, which is a very beautiful and historic building. When I was younger, I used to go there and I remember it being very bustling and packed. Unfortunately, the facility seems to have slowed down a bit. In the future, I hope a few more big vendors and businesses move into the Old Arcade and revitalize it! 

We got a ""split"" of champagne and a piece of Kahlua Heath Bar Cheesecake. The split wasn't as big as advertised, but the champagne itself was good. The cheesecake was quite delicious--it came with a generous helping of whipped cream, a rose and strawberry garnish, and a mini eclair--and the presentation of all of the aforementioned items was very artistic.

Onto the service, which seems to be the bane of many reviewers' existence. For most of our visit, we were pleasantly surprised by the service--the server was friendly and the food came out quickly. However, right at the end, we experienced a slightly longer than usual delay in paying for our meal because our server (who was doubling as the bartender at the time because it was late at night) got into a long conversation with two people who appeared to be out-of-town travelers about Cleveland. (He should have told them to go on Yelp to find out what's good!) I didn't get too peeved with this, because interactions like that can make or break a traveler's view of a town, but I was slightly annoyed by the fact that all sorts of Chocolate Bar staff swarmed around me and didn't take my bill. There were TONS of staff there walking around--I honestly wonder what all of them do!  For the Chocolate Bar's sake, I hope they're a bit more attentive during peak hours when guests are rushing to get to productions at Playhouse Square, Hilarities, or Quicken Loans Arena on time.

Visiting a local brewery whenever I'm traveling is at the top of my list. Luckily I had my bud Kris U (of Yelp Toronto GTA fame) available to take me around to some breweries on a cold Toronto night. He brought me here last, and this ended up being my favorite.

No flights, but they have 4oz pours (only two at a time)...I got a few to taste the breadth and depth of their menu.

IPA - cloudy and juicy. I love these hazy, juice bombs and this was a delight.

Sour - with notes of melon and super juicy. Not traditionally something I'd go for, but the description won me over and I'm glad I ordered it.

Stout - chocolatey good! Thick, robust...and a nice way to round out this tasting.

Place was dimly lit and cozy. I can see this being a dope date spot. It's not huge, but they a good amount of seating. I believe the serve food too, but we were too late and they were no longer serving food.

I never really had high expectations when it comes to service at Canadian Tire. However this surpassed even my expectations from Lowe's.

The wait for someone to help us on paints was pretty quick. He dealt with someone ahead of me very expediently. 

James was pretty helpful and knowledgable as to what kind of paints to use for our new condo. He tried to make sure we aren't oversold on the paints and just get enough for what we need. He noted that he preferred to sell us less than being over as we won't be able to return it.

The salt and vinegar is AMAZING. Might I recommend mixing the hot Buffalo with the Blue Cheese for a nice chicken wing inspired bag. Also we had the Chicago which mixes caramel corn (the best I've had) with nacho and white cheddar. Obviously you can go the chocolate route. Maybe next time I'll try the Oreo one.

Food~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  

However if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  

Bruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  

Paninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! 

Service~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.

I like the street-food atmosphere - the storefront is basically right out on the sidewalk - you order through the window, pay, and your waffle gets passed back out to you when it's ready.  I ate my waffle standing on Yonge Street while I people-watched.

I had a chocolate dip waffle, which was $3.99 plus tax.  It is not really chocolate ""dipped"" - they actually pour chocolate sauce over the hot waffle before they give it to you.  At first I worried they might be using Hershey's syrup, but the chocolate turned out to be better than that.  The waffle was very hot, dense (as it should be), and crunchy on the outside. 

Wanda's also serves waffles with ice cream or with fruit (or both), but next time I will forgo that and try one of the maple waffles that some previous reviewers have mentioned.",2010-05-15 16:12:44
HpasPwSE_ZSaokPWm1bLPQ,QlRsVCCytArycuuKSyUBLg,9eu2lQMROTKdrPyGkwZLYw,4,3,1,1,"Soco is a brand new restaurant that is located on the first floor of the Delta Hotel. My friend and I happened to be in the area on New Year's Day, so we decided to try this place out for dinner. It was not very busy that evening, maybe because it was new/still relatively unknown, or maybe because most people were home nursing their hangovers from the night before or spending time with family. When we arrived, I first noticed that the place had a very distinct, woody/fresh paint kind of smell, since it really is still quite new.

They have a pretty small, moderately priced dinner menu, but there were a number of dishes that caught my eye. That night however, both my friend and I ended up ordering the same thing and both got the duck confit. The description on the menu said it came with root vegetables, duck sausage, fregola sarda pasta (looks kind of like couscous/risotto), and preserved plum. When our dinners actually arrived, the duck turned out to be just a regular duck leg rather than ""duck sausage."" Overall though, the dish was good. The duck meat was very soft, moist and juicy, and it was very interesting to eat with the slightly sweet/sour/tarte flavour of the thinly sliced plum. I also liked the pasta, as it was my first time trying it. It had a slightly doughier texture than couscous/risotto. Apparently it is supposed to have a sort of nutty flavour, but I couldn't really taste that because of the sauce in the dish. While I enjoyed the dish overall, I did find that it started to get a bit too salty during the last few bites. I still recommend trying it though, as it was quite good for the price of $23.

Out of curiosity, my friend and I also decided to take a look at their dessert menu, and I was so tempted by their desserts that I broke my new year's resolution on the first day of the new year and decided try one (I do it for Yelp, guys!) I got the pumpkin walnut cheesecake which was made with maple sour cream, blackberry preserve, and of course, walnuts. The cheesecake came out in a little dome shape and was presented very nicely. I think I was expecting a bit more variety in the flavours, what with the maple and the pumpkin, but I mostly just tasted pumpkin. It was quite good for a cheesecake, although there was this weird kind of gelatinous coating over the cake, so I wasn't a huge fan of that.

For me, Soco was a hit, and I would definitely return to try their other menu items. It's got kind of a cool atmosphere, and would be a good place to come for after-work drinks, lunch/dinner with friends, or even a casual date. It's dimly lit but the bar area is bright and colourful and they played fairly upbeat music while we were there. Definitely a cool, trendy kind of place to check out!",2015-01-04 18:58:17

L'Etoile was one of the first to focus on sustainable and locally produced food and it shows with the back of the menu listing exactly where every item originates from.   The chef and staff care very much about what they are preparing/serving and it shows.  It's obviously very pricey but there is a reason for that.

The food arrived my room about 20 minutes later and I was not disappointed - the reviews are correct, the food here is absolutely excellent. The chef comped me a free small sampler of charcuterie which was a nice touch. The steak was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth-nicest-I-have-ever-tasted. The beet & goat cheese salad was also nice.

To be honest, most are downright awful (Mitchell's cough cough).  But Habitat seems to try and break that mold.  You can't beat the beautiful views and there's definitely a classy feel to the place.  I felt out of place a bit among all the suits.  But you won't find me suiting up anytime soon, don't you worry!

They have a stellar lunch special called the ""express lunch.""  You order a soup or salad, sandwich and dessert for $16 (just soup/salad and sammie is $10).  I reeeeeally wanted to go for the dessert option, but since I'm trying to watch the sweets I stayed away.  I settled on the beet salad and butternut squash soup.  The beets were presented in a way I had never seen before.  It was probably a full beet and half (I'm very aware of how much beet they server since I'm a beet nerd) with goat cheese and lettuce and honey drizzled on top.  It was different, but good.  I really liked that you could add on a protein to the salad, so I opted for the ahi tuna.  It wasn't bad either, not the best I've had, but not bad.  The butternut squash soup was also good, but was missing the really creamy consistency I enjoy.  It was creamy, but just a tad off.  

I believe our waiter wanted to sit down and enjoy the meal with us, he was so present.  That kinda sets the stage for how attentive their service here is.  I mean, your glass gets below the halfway mark and they're there.  You order, give them your menu, blink and then your lunch is in front of you.  Seriously, that's some attentive service.

Side note: The water pitcher is a ""trademarked"" silver frog that an artist designed for them.  It's seriously adorable and you can buy one for the low price of $150 (I know, not low) but the proceeds go to Habitat for Humanity, which makes the purchase awesome!  You can also put your business card in for a free one!

Personally in my experience, I've never enjoyed any Indian food buffet I've ever tried. Starting off, our party of 3 found the service to be very inviting and gracious. They really had a family business vibe. The cook, which I assumed to be the dad or patriarch, personally helped to deliver food to the table. We ordered the sampler (non-vegetarian) platter for an app which consisted of 2 chicken samosas, 4 chicken pakoras, and 4 shrimp pakoras. Delicious! Do not let the description of the pakoras defer you from order it. ""deep fried fritters"" yet they do not taste oily and the batter is made from scratch! For entrees, we ordered the sag chicken, lamb vindaloo, and paneer masala. Overall we liked the sag chicken the most because we thought the vindaloo could have been spicier (we requested 8/10 spice level). The sag was requested to be 10/10 spice and still wasn't up to par but made up for it due to its delicious flavor. We ordered the garlic naan and the peshwari naan. Garlic naan was a hit with the whole table. The peshwari naan was still decent (had coconut shavings inside which we thought to be a bit odd). Everyone had leftovers which definitely was a welcomed surprise. We do not know when we will be back but I know we will be sometime soon.",2017-07-19 17:39:39

But the second and third time I've been here was pretty good.

Dinner seems to always have a wait, especially during peak hours (starting at 7pm til around 10pm). Even during lunch there's still some wait time (damn this place is popular).

Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber! 

The parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her. 

Our server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. 

For the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. 

Unfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect.

They also used to have the best lunch buffet in the city, but they stopped doing this about 5 years ago.

Butter Chicken is always my acid test for Indian food and Babur's Butter Chicken is absolutely the best I've had in Toronto. Its creamy, sweet--- but no too sweet-- with nuts, a great spice level and the chicken is always tender and juicy--It's what keeps me coming back here (and I used to go once a week about 10 years ago). I was also a fan of the Masala Beef and the Saag Paneer. 

I'm not sure if they still do it, but they used to start you off with complimentary papadams, these delicious spicy carrot bits with black mustard seeds, tamarind chutney and coriander chutney. All were delicious.

10 years ago, I would have given Babur 5 stars. Hands down. But in recent years, I've had some service issues and haven't gone back. The last time I was there I was on a strict diet avoiding grains and starches, so my friend and I declined the waiter's suggestion that we order rice with our curries. We didn't receive rice, but we were charged $5 for it anyway! I had to argue with the waiter, telling him that we hadn't ordered any rice and he waffled, saying that he'd have to take my credit card back, print up a new bill and refund the transaction so he could ring it through again without the rice. He pointed out that he was very busy and that this procedure would take him some time. We were meeting friends for a show and had to leave. I was pretty angry and haven't gone back since. Most of the time, I've found the service to be cool and stand-offish.

I might give them another try because the food is so great, but I have noticed that the portions have become much smaller over the years and I'm not a fan of the new decor. Seems like it's all about flash these days and less about the food. I'll write and update after I return.",2013-02-22 16:52:47

With the ""Quintessentially British"", it has to be pretty good, no?

Came here on Valentine's day for dinner, Apparently you can't order their normal omakase on the menu on Valentine's day, either you order the Valentine's day omakase or a la carte. My boyfriend and I went for the a la carte choice.

Aburi Flight ($36)
Aburi Sushi, aka hand torched nigiri. The set comes with Saba, Beef, botan Ebi, Salmon, and Hamachi, 2 pieces of each fish. This place is supposed to be well known for their aburi set (torched sushi), but i found this slightly disappointing, Usually sushi places marinate their fish slightly when it comes to aburi, but here there wasn't any additional flavor other than the raw fish being torched. The fish was fresh, but i suppose I was expecting a bit more flavor.

Tried 2 of their daily special menu items:
Black cod - this was really good. This was grilled nicely, loved the skin. The meat was so soft and tender, it almost melts in your mouth.
Braised pork - I thought this would be served like pork short ribs, but instead it was a giant piece of pork belly. Lots of fat along with the meat, not too much of my liking.

Ordered a la carte sushi:
Toro sushi, my favorite (market price)
Unagi sushi ($6 for 2 pieces)
Hamachi, yellow tail ($8 for 2 pieces)
Tai, sea bream ($7 for 2 pieces)
All the fish was really fresh - definitely enjoyed the nigri sushi.
They said they ran out of Ameabi (sweet shrimp), so instead they offered us to try the fresh live scallop sashimi. This was nice - you can taste the freshness. It came plated with the shell as well so the presentation was nice.

Unashiso Maki (8 pieces for $15)
This was a disappointment. Prior to coming I was hesitant about this place considering it is located in the Distillery District, I had a feeling the restaurant might not be as authentic. I thought otherwise while trying everything else until came this roll. I suppose the other explanation could be they don't specialize in rolls? The roll just had a lot of rice, with a small piece of unagi (bbq eel), and for $15 I would expect a better presentation on the roll itself.

Overall the food was great. Don't think I would come back as there are other better sushi options at this price.",2016-02-24 20:12:49

What we ordered..

Chicken tempura udon- My friend's order. She said it was not that great. The broth (which i tried) was lacking in flavor. Underseasoned I would say. Chicken tempura was 2 thins slices of chicken in tempura batter. No issues there.

Miso carbonara udon- What I ordered. In the reviews people had said you can taste the hint of miso. Unfortunately, i did not taste miso at all. Instead it was just drenched in alfredo sauce. I still had half a bowl of alfredo sauce in my bowl after finishing. Basically, this dish is more of just udon in alfredo. I don't recommend.

Parking lot is a ridiculous Zoo, even considering there's more parking out back, but tight quarters and lots of rude people make it a nightmare everytime.

The restaurant itself is very small, although much nicer since the renovations, than it used to be. 

Service is curt and efficient at best, rude and completely uninterested at worst.

But the food, the food is still fabulous.

Spectacular extra spicy chili-studded chicken pakora, served with spicy dip and even more tiny green chiles, are absolutely delicious and perfectly fried, so they are crispy on the outside, yet super moist and tender inside. Also great are the stir fried green beans and the chili chicken never fails to satisfy.

My other guilty pleasure is the sweet and sour shrimp over fried rice lunch special, which feature relatively small, but freshly battered and deep-fried, shrimp with pineapple, onion and bell pepper in an electric neon hot pink sweet and sour sauce. Served over a huge container of fried rice, and all for about $6 bucks, how can you complain about that?

That bargain lunch special and an order of chicken pakora gets a huge eater like me TWO full meals, or a moaning, aching, whiny afternoon if I foolishly try to tackle the whole thing, LOL

STILL a great place, in my book. ENJOY!",2018-09-14 20:23:37

Mostly good but a few bad ones.  I have to say that usually only read the really bad reviews so I can get a feel for what may be wrong.  I was especially interested in the ones that said the sesame chicken was not good since Ashley L. said that was her favorite.  
So I went and decided to let her lead.  They bring out the hot jasmine tea to poor into these little cups.  I must say that on a cold (well Arizona cold) day this was fantastic.  It was full of flavor and a nice start to the meal.  We both ordered the sesame chicken lunch combo and boy was I in for a treat.  
We started with egg drop soup.  This is not my normal favorite as I do not like tofu and it is usually unpleasant if I get a bite.  It is mostly the texture I don't like but the tofu was smooth and tasted like the broth and so I ate the whole bowl.  Then out came the lunch.  I was not expecting this much food.  I can see why some people were put off by the sesame chicken as it is not prepared the way it is everywhere else.  It felt so much lighter and had more flavor than I could imagine.  It was a piece of breaded chicken with a light sauce and green onions over it.  It was excellent.  Ashley L. is not a fan of chicken but loves this chicken and I can see why.  It was perfectly prepared with no fat globs anywhere.  It was moist and cooked to perfection.  This came with fried rice on the side.  The rice was well cooked with nice crunchy vegetables mixed in.  There were to fried wontons that were perfectly done and not too oily.  I don't like fried wontons usually because they make the mouth feel like is has been greased yuck.  These did not have that horrible side effect.  The egg roll was perfectly crisp without any of the guminess that can occur if not cooked properly.  Fresh delicious vegetable inside.  
Now to the service.  I don't know who our waiter was exactly because it felt like everyone was waiting on us.  It wasn't terribly busy but there was great teamwork.  Our tea never ran out no matter how fast we drank it they always filled it before we could finish it.  Our water glasses always had fresh water and ice and our plates were cleared promptly.  It was almost eerie how things would appear and disappear while we talked.  We never felt rushed to leave and even after the check was on the table we were checked on frequently.  
The price for both of us was $19 and was well worth the food and the service that we received.

The gnocchi was good, but the lobster ravioli was amazing! Stuffed with lots of fresh lobster chunks in a creamy alfredo sauce. Chef Marino also threw in some extra appetizers for us in the beginning for free which was an awesome touch. The tiramisu was a great end to the meal and it wasn't too sweet like other places.

You can tell that they need to do a lot of improvements. Popcorn ceilings from the 1950s, stained carpet, sink in the middle of the room, etc. We walked in around 1230 am and there was no one to be seen or heard. No note or anything just an empty space. We had just driven for 4 hours and we were tired with a little one. 15 minutes later the guy finally shows up. If you aren't going to be at the front desk then leave a note saying you will be back. It's just BAD customer service even if you are the only one working. Secondly, my husband asked for a room higher up and away from the elevators. He told us our room was at the end of the hallway. Wrong...it's 3 rooms from the elevator. Obviously, you don't even know the layout of the floors so that's just not cool. Thirdly, the king size bed is just a little bigger than a queen size bed and is so uncomfortable that it definitely needs to be changed out. Feeling the inner spring coils is not cool and it creaks like there's no tomorrow. Lastly, the smell of weed woke me up. This place needs to figure out a better air system because these air units suck. 

In conclusion, don't stay here. You can do much better than this place after paying $130 a night. Drive a little further to get a way better place.",2014-10-11 16:08:47

I don't want to tell anyone how to run their business. But if you are going to host a private party and remain open to the public, you may want to make sure your kitchen can handle the load.

If there is a band that I CAN'T miss, I'll drive to Flagstaff or Tucson to go see them.

I wish I could take it back when I said that security is friendly.  They're really not.  One of my friends has been kicked out more times than he's stayed through an entire show.  We're not talking about someone who picks fights with people.  If anything he's tipsy and having a good time.  They always find a way to kick him out.

Drinks and fees cost too much money.  Like I said before, I rather use it towards gas money to go to Flagstaff and drink for cheap at the Orpheium Theater.

The patdown to get in is a JOKE.  I actually wore PJ bottoms last night so I wouldn't get hassled.  The guy still opened my pack of cigarettes to smell and see if it smelled like pot.  REALLY?!  Come on!  I'm not 16 and I'm not stupid.  

Sadly, there is another show tonight that I really want to go to.  I have decided to skip it to stop supporting this place. I have certain standards in order for me to spend x amount of money on a fun night out.  This place does not deliver.

I've always thought there must be something in the water, but after reading the business section for many years you realize that the old adage about selling something in Peoria, IL is correct. Can you say test market? 

The greater Chicagoland area had Jimmy John's, Jersey Mikes, Pot Bellies, Quizno's, et cetera over ten years ago. But, if you wait long enough sometimes things come to you. Jimmy's John's for the most part is a college sub shop (started many years ago in Elgin).  Which makes sense, because if you wanted one of their subs up until now you needed to drive down to Tempe and ASU.  But, that doesn't mean they're making poor quality subs -- they're actually making GREAT subs!

Their sandwiches are fresh, they use quality meats and seem to have learned the art of self-humor in their marketing: ""Subs so fast, you'll freak!""  They actually merchandise this stuff!  Also, when you go, make sure you read their signage on the walls.   It's really very funny.

Great, great sandwiches -- Enjoy!

It's a crazy relationship. One minute I'm in love, the next I'm like ""What was I thinking?"" There's some items on the menu that are good, and others that need improvement. Even my friends and family members that have tried Shuseki feel the same- they don't hate it, but they don't love it either. Perhaps I'm just eating the wrong dishes.

Chicken Katsu Curry Rice- Pretty good. The rice is fluffy and sticky, the curry sauce is overflowing and flavorful. Not the best Japanese curry I've had in Vegas, but definitely in the top 5.
Shrimp Tempura Udon- The dish that I order the most often from Shuseki. You can't really go wrong with an udon soup dish on a cold night, the broth is delicious and really fills you up.
Takoyaki- Your standard Takyoaki with Japanese mayonnaise and fish flakes. Definitely fulfills my Takoyaki cravings whenever they occur.
Korokke(Croquette)- One of their better appetizers. Always crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. 

Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen- Not a fan of Shuseki's ramen. I've tried most of their ramen dishes, and the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen is the one that disappointed me the most. It's flavored with chili oil that separates itself from the broth, the broth itself is bland and watery, and ramen noodles overcooked. The bowl only looks huge, but it is mostly filled with soup rather than noodles and pork. 
Yaki Udon- Again, a dish that falls flat on flavor and content. Flavor is OK, tastes like something I could have made at home. I like my noodle dishes with more noodles than meat or vegetables. This one has more bean sprouts than noodles!
Sushi- Some rolls are better than others, but you don't really come to Shuseki for sushi. For the price that you're paying, you can find fresher/better quality fish at restaurants that do specialize in sushi. 

Service is decent for a Chinatown restaurant. It never truly gets crowded (meaning I've never seen more than half of the tables full), but when a few tables do come in at the same time, I've noticed that the one waiter or waitress on duty gets overwhelmed at times and rarely gets back-up.

Immediately after we were seated, the line-ups at the door started.  There were so many people here on a Saturday night!  There were mostly families with young kids here.  Thus, the place was a little loud and it looked like the servers' patience were stretched thin (when we paid the bill, the servers looked very frantic in serving new customers and taking care of orders.  It took a while before we were given our bill and a take-out box).

Sugar Marmalade is primarily a dessert place (you can see this in their menu where the first couple of pages are all devoted to so many different categories of Chinese desserts and drinks with Western influences and only a couple of pages in the back for Taiwanese appetizers and rice dishes).  Ironically enough, we didn't end up ordering any desserts here even though I was certainly curious about them.  However, I thought that the desserts were a bit overpriced...

As always, I like to order popcorn chicken!  The Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken here was $7.49 per portion and good thing that it actually arrived in a substantial portion!  It was served with a side of Thai sweet and spicy sauce too (interesting...).

I was actually quite impressed with their popcorn chicken!  It was salty enough for my taste and didn't have too much batter either.  The first couple of pieces were so delicious!  However, after we left it on the table for a while, I noticed that the latter pieces -- having been cooled down -- had a more obvious batter taste that was chunky.

K got a rice dish, the Chicken & Chinese Mushroom on Steamed Rice.  I was surprised to see this presented on a plate when it arrived.  It seemed more fitting that this type of dish be served in a bowl.  Anyway, the rice when mixed with the sauce was quite good as were the mushroom and chicken pieces.  There was nothing special about it but it was still good.",2017-06-28 03:07:58

I mean, seriously, Double Marshmallow Oreo (Rich chocolate custard loaded with Oreo cookie pieces and marshmallow creme)? Or, Butter Brickle (Specially blended butter pecan custard enhanced with all-time favorite chewy chunks of Heath Bar.)  Who could resist a special trip!?!

Culver's is known for their ButterBurgers, though. It's worth noting that unless you order a Deluxe you have to specify which of the toppings like mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce you want; otherwise, ya just get a buttered bun! They make a big deal about the meat being ""fresh, never frozen 100% US raised"" and cooked to order and they're pretty tasty, but this is a fast food burger, not what I like to refer to as a ""backyard burger."" So keep your expectations in check an you will be pleased.

The counter service has been good each time I've visited, but I have to give a shout out to my favorite, Luther, who broke it all down for me and, no doubt, made my first visit to the Metro location go smooth. 

It's worth noting they have items besides burgers, like salads and pot roast dinners. Although I haven't ventured there yet, I happen to be a fan of pork tenderloin sandwiches and am looking forward to giving the one at Culver's a try.

After coming back from a Charlotte football game, my girlfriends and I tried this place since we had heard good things. I wish I had checked out my trusty yelp before stepping in the door. It was a cold night and the bar was pretty packed. Luckily, we found a table by the window and squeezed in. The temperature inside was almost as cold. Our waitress wasn't mean, she was just bad. Clearly, they were understaffed. We literary had to wave her down anytime we needed anything. She didn't come to check our beer or water once during our hour and half visit. We left with all empty glasses and only received silverware after flagging down a bus boy.The bus boy brought out all our food and he was the most polite and helpful out of the entire staff- Thank you for being the only good part of this place. Our Margaritas weren't bad, but the chicken tacos were underwhelming. Some random pieces of chicken thrown atop of shredded melted cheese and hot sauce. I ordered the PERI PERI GRILLED CHICKEN PANINI, this was absolutely horrible. I thought about sending it back but was afraid I wouldn't  get a second order of anything since our waitress played a disappearing act.

I've passed by Crêpe Expectations quite a bit in the years that I've lived in this town. I finally decided that I should try it after seeing Guy Fieri taste some crepes on his show otherwise known as Triple D, which would make it my my second official show-inspired visit (most of the others having come before Guy visited/bantered/tasted/filmed). When my friend suggested that we stop by after we picked him up from the airport, I was pretty excited.

It was just before 11am on a Sunday, so it was packed. People were already sitting outside, and all of those tables were occupied by the time we left. We waited awkwardly for not more than ten minutes in the seats lining the hallway to the restrooms before the host waved us over to place our orders at the register. Bearded dude from the show was manning the register, but he ended up talking about my hoodie before I could get in a word about the TV segment. That's alright though - it's not super fresh in memory.

However, what was fresh was The Sonora ($9.50), which I'm pretty sure was also featured on the show. It's also popular with my Yelp friends, so I had to try it. The filling was indeed excellent, with a symphony of delicious carne asada, tomato salsa, guacamole, and jack cheese. The greens on the side are dressed to the point of almost being overwhelmingly acidic, but it completes the ubiquitous carne asada flavor if you portion it correctly. I would've liked for them to just throw in in the crepe. Perhaps they'll humor me if I request that next time.

I also tried a couple bites of my friend's The Monterey ($7.85), with bacon, scrambled eggs, red onion, serrano, and jack cheese. It's just breakfast in a crepe, and it's very balanced, not salty as you might fear, and barely any heat if it was indeed at all spicy. I did find it odd that a bowl of thinly sliced banana was served with this crepe though. It doesn't match the flavor profile at all, so I suppose it's just a nice complimentary dessert. Odd though.

Finally, we agreed on sharing an interesting sweet crepe, The Avalon ($7.75). It's a not-too-sweet affair chock-full of sauteed buttered pear, which the goat cheese and honey played really off of. The whipped cream was great and really enriched the crepe. I liked the candied walnuts too, but they were fairly sparse and didn't provide enough crunch overall to balance out the soft slices of pear. That texture became a drag after a few bites.

Aside from that, what really stopped me from going for the full five stars was the crepes. The crepe texture just dies next to all the wet ingredients, and two of the three crepes were torn when served. I'm sure it's not an uncommon occurrence with crepes, but it means that these crepes don't do much except serve as a relatively low-carb vehicle for the ingredients. I came in with expectations that the crepes would be a highlight, but they aren't.

That said, I will definitely return to Crêpe Expectations to try their other menu items. I like what they're doing with their flavors, and the portions are affordable if a bit modest compared to typical breakfast/lunch fare.",2016-01-17 21:06:02

He forgot drinks, food was served to us cold, didn't even bring the appetizer we ordered. If he tried any harder to ignore us, it would have been downright funny. 

The biggest turn off was the glass of water he served to one of my dinner guests which was rimmed with ANTS. It was almost like they dipped the rim of the glass into a whole pile of the dead ants before serving it. How he missed it, I'll never know. It was disgusting. Not an apology. Not a discount offered.

I was lucky enough to visit at soon as they open on a weekday since I had a day off when my parents were visiting. Arriving at opening on a weekday meant getting a parking spot in the lot right next door. Parking wasn't too expensive and I felt like my car was safe in the lot.

Inside we purchased tickets and I like that they offer a locals discount. The building is really interesting. It has a historical feeling and I like that this is the actual building where mob member trials were actually held. 

I incorrectly assumed before coming here that the museum would be all about the mob in Las Vegas. The museum actually talked about families in Cleveland, Chicago, New York, and other cities. It was cool that they talked about what was happening across the country, not just in Las Vegas.

There was so much to see. I think we spent a good two hours here and could have probably spent more. They gave a lot of information in an interesting way. One of the coolest parts of the museum for me was the courtroom where trials were held. Very cool to see.

Sometimes when I am feeling cheap, I will go to Green Panther. After my last experience at the St. Viateur location, it will be my last resort for vegan food in the Mile End.

Good : I only get the half pita Chic Kebab with no carrots and extra sauce. I usually get the half pita because it's $3 less than the full pita... the difference is 1 inch more of bread, but no extra filling. Get the sweet potatos if you get a chance, it's very flavorful! 

Bad : I've tried the Tempehtation (eh) and VégéBurger (meh) on separate occasions, which neither are outstanding, and yet I still go back because it's cheap food on the go. I usually order a side of sweet potatoes for an extra $3 when you order a pita and it's a pretty generous portion. However, at the St. Viateur location, they gave me 6 pieces of potatoes for a side.

So, we stopped into Vida. It was 6:30 on Sat night and surprisingly we were immediately seated. We opted for a high top in the bar area. We started with Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole. The Guac was very good. I liked how they put chopped tomatoes on top of it, and it was just the right spiciness. Then we decided to split the grilled salmon, grilled corn, and fried plantains. This was very good eats. Excellent flavor and not an overwhelming amount of food. Did I mention we split it? Some mexican places tend to give you so much food you can't eat it all, this portion size was pretty reasonable. By splitting, we ended up with a lite meal for both of us. The Margarita's were good as well, we stepped up one notch from the house version. Although, they weren't very strong. I like my Margrita's to pack and punch and these were definitely on the not strong side. It was a nice date night experience, as we prepared for a show at the Blumenthal Theater.  The only downside was the cost. It ended up being a pretty pricey meal considering we only had 1 entree, but the 5 Margrita's was a bill breaker.

GENIOUS! The wait time in the app said 45-1 hour. We arrived 50 minutes later and our table was ready. I overheard the hostess apologize as she told those in line without the app that they'd have a hour long wait. On a side note, this was actually not as bad as the other times we called- 2+ hour wait. So, the real question was would BRGR live up to the hype and extraordinary wait times? The answer - in short- No.

I started with a chocolate milkshake while hubs got a martini. The shake was thick and tasty. No complaints there. The food came out quickly, especially the kids meal. I ordered the Average Joe with white cheddar. I was looking for the basic burger so that I could really taste the flavor and quality of the meat. Hubs ordered a salmon burger and we split the BRGR fries which were described as being topped with parmesan and herbs. Being preggo, I had to order my burger well done. Regardless of the temp, my expectation at a restaurant that specializes in burgers is to have a well seasoned, juicy burger. What I ended up with was a dry, somewhat tasteless piece of meat. The fries were also decidedly average. The parm and herbs were lightly sprinkled on top and did not stick to the fries. On a positive note, the service was great. Overall, I am in no rush to get back to BRGR. Nothing stood out to me as being spectacular. Maybe the crazy toppings on some of the specialty burgers add the missing flavor element.

We asked to be seated outside and the waitress who walked us over was kind and let us pick the table we preferred. Our main waitress, Sophia, was on her third day at the job. She was kind, fun, and considerate. She was respectful and did her very best to provide suggestions and answer questions. The other waiters were very kind, too. The starter bread was awesome, especially the thin, crunchy triangular crackers. The food was good though it was a little cold and could have used more flavor. I got the Margherita flatbread while my friend got the Lasangna that came with a salad. Each of us paid roughly $15 for our meal.

I had made 10:15 reservations for 4 (according to open table that was the earliest they could seat a 4 top) and it worked out well because the show was over at 10. Although we became a party of 3, they easily accommodated us and we were seated directly beneath the antler chandelier. We all loved the rustic decor and the bourbon/whiskey wall behind the bar was very cool. We did not get a chance to go upstairs but I could see it somewhat and it looked mostly the same as the downstairs. We were greeted quickly, our drinks took longer than we'd have liked but the quality of the 2 cocktails quickly made up for that . We ordered a dogfishhead 60 minute, a manhattan, and a butcher sour (my drink of choice). The cocktail I enjoyed was nicely handcrafted and the manhattan was described as ""aces""-so this is an excellent place to grab a unique cocktail. The features they had last night looked delicious (a burger with pork belly, a hangar steak with frites, a squash tasting, and a pasta) however we were told that they were out of all of the features. The three of us started with the pig candy-""pork belly / apple kim chi / miso caramel / cilantro""-it was very tasty but not enough for three people so I only had a small bite and let the other 2 in my party eat most of it. As for entrees, the pappardelle (braised rabbit / carrots / tomato / celery / parmesan), the shepherd's pie (braised beef cheeks / creamed peas / carrots / bacon / potato foam), and the mac and cheese off of the small plate menu (taleggio / fontina / goat cheese / cheddar / parmesan). I did not try the pappardelle but that is what I would have ordered had I not ordered the mac and cheese. I was told it was well cooked with large noodles. I tried a bite of the shepherd's pie-the beef cheeks were excellent and the potato foam was like nothing I had tasted before. it was more of a deconstructed shepherd's pie with the potato foam covering the dish. The mac and cheese was off the charts yummy! It was very creamy and rich and was the perfect size to finish on my own. The top was toasted nicely and the crunchiness naturally meshed nicely with the creaminess of the cheese. It is rather hard to get reservations here but it was well worth it and I'd love to go back and try the Butcher's Bride cocktail and the pappardelle.

The bread basket sent me coupons for a long time, so while I was visiting my local Sunflower Market, I decided to take a peak in. Not going in for anything particular, just looking around.

Behind the counter is a GIANT oven, and the place smells yeasty of heaven. I am pretty sure this place is family owned since there was one single guy in there, with his new assistant to help customers.

I glanced at the bread and they had many kinds. Pre cut loafs of honey wheat bread, stone ground wheat bread, rosemary bread. They also had bakery bread (i'm not well adverse in the types of bread there are). I believe one was Spelt bread, and some other types, but I could NOT find just a plain ol French bread. I'm a sucker for French. Their cinnamon bread looked AMAZING, as did the banana bread. Dense and dark. I bet it's dreamy, but I didn't purchase it. I was more in the mood for something sweet.

My boyfriend decided to go with the brownie (1.75) and I picked up a pack of frosted sugar cookies (3pk). After our 6 dollar purchase we walked outside back into the heat to give them a try. I broke off a piece of sugar cookie, and it was very plain and mediocre. The frosting was hard, and left a waxy film on the roof of my mouth. My boyfriend however thought the frosting was ""too much"" and was too sweet for the cookie. The cookie itself I don't see classified as a ""sugar"" cookie. Very crumbley and plain.

The brownie my boyfriend got reminded me of dunkin heinz out of the box brownie mix but with less oil, less sugar, and more cakey. I dunno.. not impressed AT all. Needless to say we didn't finish these goodies. Didn't satisfy the sweet tooth.

If I do go back, I will try the banana bread and cinnamon bread. Maybe one of their muffins I saw sitting in the back. They gotta be good at BREAD, but cookies and brownies didn't do it for me.

I found the folks in the box office super friendly and nice... and the front door folks - checking bags and IDs were fairly polite.  I'm sure towards the end of the night, they probably get tired of dealing with folks that have ""over-indulged"" in the evening... but whats a concert without one of ""those guys/gals""??

Depending on the event, the outdoor space in the back was pretty cool (connecting with the Uptown Amphitheater).  And the bathroom space is meant for large crowds.

I am surprised at how many times I visit a steak house and am disappointed with how my steak is cooked. That certainly wasn't the case at Longhorn Westgate!

We were seated right away and greeted by our server Martha. We were hungry, so an order went in right away and just a few minutes later, food appeared on our table. We started with the Sweet chili Calamari. Wowwwww. The chili sauce was so good, my fiancée kept the leftover to put on his meal. The calamari were crisp on the outside, tender seafood on the inside. It was a good portion. As always, the bread was fresh and delicious.

The salads are great too. It's a nice mix of greens with plenty of toppings. My 8 oz Renegade was honestly the most perfect steak I've ever had in a restaurant. I don't like my steaks with much pink, but I went with Medium Well today. It was a good call and this steak was cooked exactly how a Medium Well should be. It had just a bit of pink, was nice and tender, hot throughout and well done enough for me. It wasn't over-seasoned so I could actually taste the quality beef. My baked potato was cooked properly and served with ample butter and sour cream.
He got the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken and broccoli and thought both were delicious. The chicken had a lot of great flavor- lots of melty cheese, crispy panko on top. 

We were both so pleased with our food and service and will definitely make this our go to steak spot!",2017-10-12 14:53:46
0zHffsNc4hhhW8rgHuW1Mw,f-eoW1jeCLNRXrx5E05kxg,Fwt0ia7H80q_mHLvrf1gzQ,4,1,0,0,"Really enjoyed this buffet by Imperial. This was my first time coming here. So i can say, i'm not a spoonfull buffet vigin anymore. For anyone reading this, that was pretty lame... 

Anyhoo. I came here to my birthday *yay happy birthday to me =)* and I got 50% off! For all the guests that had came with me they also got additional 15% off. It's a win win situation. Four of the guests that came with me were legible for senior discount, so  they got to pay the senior fee and on top 15%. Mind you that the birthday discounts are only good if you bring CASH. They will not accept credit card if you try to do it on your birthday or someone's birthday, so if anyone is planning on go on their birthday bring cash, and your ID to get that DISCOUNT! I really believe this promo, is very good deal. Also mind that the party limit on amount of people who comes with you on your birthday can be minimum 4 and maximum 10. 

Unfortunately, this promo does not work on Saturdays, which sucks because some people's birthday may land on that day and won't be able to use it. But I suppose it's because on Saturdays they are mad busy on a regular basis so they probably believe they will not be able to accommodate everyone. 

The interior is very modern and very bright. They have I believe 3 large open concept dining areas where all the customers sit and eat.  2 on the sides and one large area in the middle. They also have I think 2 private rooms? I can be wrong. Someone can confirm that if they go. The food there is pretty notch.  From a lot of other people's review this AYCE place is pretty good.  

This place has so much variety in food you simply cannot eat everything. I believe it will take someone two visits to eat everything, unless you have a huge appetite and maybe also perhaps if your fat then maybe ;) 

But yes, there's alot of variety, they got : 

-Sushi (sashimi, maki rolls) 
-Salad bar 
- Custom pad thai and pasta section ( made to order) 
- grilled meat section ( roast beef, chicken, fried chicken, pork and etc) 
- Comfort food section, ( pizza's, macoroni, mac salad, garlic brea, lobster mac n cheese, risotto)  
-Soups ( alot of different choices of soups) 
-Seafood,( crab legs, oysters, mussels, shrimp)
- A huge selection of dessert (donut machine (OMG so amazing), chocolate fountain, ice cream ,crepe, waffles, brownies, cakes, fruits, candy gummies and more) 

Only downside was some grilled meat's they had were very chewy and some was just pure fat.. So that part wasn't so good. They output a lot of meat therefore I can believe they do not have time to cut it carefully before distribution. Figured, it's AYCE. 

I probably missed out on a few things here just because like I mentioned the variety is so large it's hard to eat and try everything the first time you go. The quality of the food is very impressive for a AYCE restaurant. It's indeed above average and I may even say some things are equally as good if you were to go eat a 5 star restaurant. Out of alot of AYCE places, this is probably my most favorable pick. Imperial has been around for a long time and really knows the AYCE game. No offence to some other buffets but Imperial owns that plaza lol. 

I definitely need to go back to try out the other desserts that I wish I had got to try but unfortunately I was too over stuffed that I had to refrain myself from lying down in the car. And yes, when you lie down in the car after AYCE that's the sign that you had too much. And it's the worst feeling after trying to digest all that food. It's seriously a mission =) 

8.5/10 in my books. Really good buffet, food quality is very good, service is good too. Some of the cooks are very friendly as well. If you haven't tried this place before, it's a place definitely worth trying.",2015-01-18 17:33:37

I remember we would go to Pittsburgh to hang out, drink and then one day a friend said we've gotta go to Primanti's.  It's so good.  they put fires and slaw on the sandwiches.  HUH?!?!?  I despise soggy bread and the thought of runny slaw (like kfc) being on my sandwich grossed me out.  But after having multiple and probably 3 too many drinks, we ended up here.  Kielbasa double meat plz, no tomatoes.  
Well, the slaw is not runny, it's lightly dressed with vinegar and IDK what else.  I always take off about half of the French Fries and half of the slaw because they can be too much and I just eat them on the side.  
Overall, it is not the best sandwich Ive ever eaten but it is a pretty tasty sandwich, not just when I was tipsy :)

The restaurant is famous for both their burgers and sushi, especially the fusion of the two, and the name is? wait for it....""Bergushi""! 

Coming from an Asian background, never would I have thought sushi and burgers would go well together, so I had to give it a try!!!

I ordered their popular Bergushi-- ""Taste Explosion""! The plate had sushi rolls evenly spread out, topped with different sauces with a hint of pesto on top. The rolls looked like as if their were fried, but it's actually the tempura crust (which is deep-fried). 

First of all, the dish looked amazing, and as I put it in my mouth, the taste LITERALLY EXPLODED in my mouth. The burger meat with different veggies and a layer of bacon wrapped around by the tempura sushi rice, The beef, sushi rice, celery, carrots, onion, bacon, pesto, slice of tomato...etc, all come together and bust in your mouth!!

The negative straight up: Service was extremely slow. Our server was pleasant, but trying to be multiple places at once; communications with the bar weren't flowing well. I saw our beer flight sitting on the bar for over five minutes (I timed it) before our server went to fetch it.

However, there are bountiful positives. My husband loves craft beer and there's not much available on the west side, much less places that offer growler fills. We ordered the beer flight. My husband found them all drinkable and had to really debate which of his new favorites to get as a growler.

We were visiting mid-afternoon on Sunday and didn't need a full meal. We ordered the pretzel appetizer. Now, I'm a bread snob; I make all my bread at home. These are exceptionally good pretzel sticks--perfect chewy texture with proper pretzel salt on top. The cheese dip was what really made this awesome. It had real body and complex flavor--cheese and some kind of ale, and it was thick so it actually stayed on the pretzel bread. (Applebees serves nasty, watery cheese dip--bleh!)

To put this into perspective, I live in the downtown area. So getting out here is like a solid 20 - 25 minute drive for me. But oh-so-worth it!

For food I let Jen take care of the orders as she had more insight as to what to eat, here's the breakdown:

Spicy tofu with seafood, served in a boiling bowl of delicious broth. You can either get it mild or spicy.

Bim bim bap, served in a cast iron bowl infused with lots of vegetables and meat all mixed together with rice.

It's not a lounge, it's not a nightclub and it's barely a restaurant (the menu is sparse). 

The Venue:
It's situated right downtown and sadly most of these venues have to survive off the ""downtown tourists"" from the suburbs. My guess is that this place is aimed to give those (middle aged) people a sense of ""the big city"" and that it does. It strives to have a mature hip feel, the dinning room employs the newly popular community seating (i.e. you could find yourself sharing a bench/table with the couple right next to you), and they have a DJ playing trance music while you dine. They succeed in that regard. This does have an old skewl slightly upscale ""metro"" feel to it.

The Food: 
A very sparse menu, I had the carne pizza which had GREAT thin crust but lacked much flavor.

The service:
The service staff is where they REALLY fail. You can go to places like FEZ, Cibo, or Pallete and it's instantaneously clear that you are being served by PROFESSIONALS. Not so much here, quite the opposite actually. Our service was what I expect from a breakfast dinner or The Waffle House (the waitress was FAR to casual for a place like this, i.e. it was kinda a like ""so watcha want?"" kinda thing going on). And honestly, with the current unemployment rate, as well as the location and style of this place, it's completely unacceptable to me.

So if your looking for poor service in Downtown now you have three choices: Carly's, Breadfruit and now Hanny's

All-in-all ... I'd say that this place is yet another venue that regretfully caters to the occasional downtown tourist and adds very little to the sustainability of a REAL downtown (that Phoenix so lacks). It gets a ""meh"".",2008-12-06 18:49:19

I'm still optimistic about this place even though of my 3 times here I saw the servers flubbing up the orders (one of them being mine).

You will find fantastic decor with a modern flair and the old brick walls of the firehouse, with information on it's history prominently displayed from behind the front desk. I was promptly checked in and offered some delicious fruit and mint infused water when I arrived about five minutes early for my appointment. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for my stylist, I wasn't perturbed due to the chill vibe and great magazines that they had available. The session started with a head and neck massage, then moved into shampoo and deep conditioning (with hot towel wrapped around your locks), then concluded with a top-of-the-line haircut. The stylist that I had today, Andrew, was very personable and answered my questions about the med spa portion of the establishment. And I love my new 'do!

Upon my inquiry, Andrew led me upstairs where I met one of the owners (Lindsay) who showed me their face imagery machine and let me have my picture taken to judge me against others in my age group on the amount of wrinkles, sun damage, bacteria, etc that was on my picture. She then proceeded to walk me through some options of their services that could help out my problem areas - and didn't apply any pressure to buy anything, which pleasantly surprised me. 

There are four parking spaces in front of the renovated brick firehouse and many behind, so don't freak if you don't snag a prime spot.

The pate had a Eastern European influence. It was quite savory with a hint of nuttiness from the pistachios. 

For our main course, we shared the wild sea bass. It came with a delicious tomato vinaigrette. It had a wonderful array of flavors and a great balance between creaminess and lightness. I'd certainly recommend the dish if it's available.

The restaurant reminds me very much like a neighborhood restaurant.  There were many at the bar that would appear to be regulars enjoying the happy hour and games on television.  But other seating options offer a nice choice from a quiet booth to window seating that looks out toward the street.  Although too hot to open the doors, I am sure that they would open them during cooler times. 

Meals included the Sea Bass with Spinach Ravioli.  Very good.  Other reviews comment that it melts in your mouth and they are correct.  My friend had the Veal Sorrentino which looked amazing.  Desserts are limited.  We had the Tiramisu and Chocolate Chip Cannoli, but very good. 

Wine list is limited, but the selection is good and pricing is very reasonable by the bottle. 

It will be slightly pricier than your chain restaurant, but it offered a very nice experieince for an extended evening meal and conversation.  Amazingly, it was not very busy and we were able to enjoy an extended dinner and conversation without feeling that we needed to rush out.

You will note a lack of fancy frills in the energetically elegant room: clearly the focus is on the open kitchen, and more importantly, the food coming from it via the personal, attentive servers. Several menus will be offered, including a Cookbook Tasting which actually notes the pages from which these dishes were taken (a signed copy of Chef Mina's book can be added to your experience). The a la carte menu also includes many of Mina's signature tasting trios, presenting lamb, fish or beef in enticing variations. The only drawback to this arrangement is that you will likely see dishes from different menus that you'll want to try. Sometimes they can accomodate this, sometimes they can't.

If ordering by the dish, you would do well to start with the Michael Mina parfait: A strata of alderwood-smoked salmon, crème fraiche and Osetra caviar on a potato-shallot cake that is a mouth-filling mélange of salt, savory and creamy sweetness. A seasonal menu also offers a novel chilled seafood plate--far from your father's raw bar, this selection of uni, mussels, clams and laughing bird shrimp is a fanciful fresh festival. 

Seafood has always been a Mina specialty, and there are many such satisfying selections here. His signature Maine lobster pot pie serves the perfectly cooked crustacean with a rich black truffle cognac in pastry. Thai Snapper with sunchoke, bok choy, pineapple marmalade, kefir lime and a bacon vineagrette is a dance of earth and ocean in your mouth. The sea scallop with foie gras, phyllo-dusted Dover sole with crab mascarpone brandade, and miso-glazed sea bass are all rich pleasures as well.

From the land, the tasting trio of lamb with different mole sauces is a juicy, aromatic rondo while the Three Sisters plates pork with three fall vegetables. There is an equally inspired Surf & Turf as well.

Chef Mina has always stressed a certain level of autonomy for his restaurant's Executive Chefs; here, the recently appointed Marc St. Jacques is also able to express his creativity in some enticing preparations of his own. Master Sommelier Joe Phillips not only pours apropos pairings, but shares stories of the wine's sourcing. 

This is also the place to impress your vegetarian friends: MM offers a meat-free tasting menu with dishes like White Asparagus Veloute and Artichoke Souffle that look every bit as delectable as the standard menu--they will also adapt other dishes with aplomb. A cheese course, creative desserts and petit fours will end your evening exquisitely.",2010-01-10 02:12:06

The menu has also shrunk a bit and contain only the more popular items from before, but I was assured that their summer cold ramen noodles will still make an appearance (Whew! Those were my favorite). 

This location also has a mini shop selling drinks, desserts and snacks, but the shop is smaller as well. I can't help but think this little shop area would be much more useful as additional seating area, as I hardly see anyone buying anything from there. The items on sale are available elsewhere, so there really isn't any reason to be both a restaurant and a super mini convenience store at the same time.

For this visit, I ordered the Tokyo Shoyu Ramen, which my waitress said was her favourite. It is a more classic style of ramen and they do an admirable job at it. Personally, I found the broth just a tad too salty and did not finish off the soup like I usually do at my favourite ramen shop. I remember this being the case as well on their take of my favourite style of ramen - the tonkotsu style ramen, where their broth was just a tad too overwhleming. Having that said, I know that this saltiness level is perfect for others.

I think Ramen Raijin can definitely improve on their pricing, as there are some pretty competitive ramen places out there that either give more generous portions of toppings, or is a dollar or two cheaper. Expect to spend just under $20 after tax and tip for a bowl of ramen with 1 or 2 additional topping (usually egg and extra meat are my go-to's)

Despite being at a new location, the staff were seasoned enough both in the dining room and the kitchen such that food arrived quickly. I was also happy for them that it was packed on their opening night, so clearly they have a very dedicated following who loves what they do and offer.

Overall, Ramen Raijin is a fine place for a good bowl of ramen and I would recommend it.",2017-04-08 12:25:36

This has to be one of my favorite places to go, here on my second trip just using a day pass. Everything here is in clean good order and in abundance.

The variety and availability of different types of equipment is phenomenal. The staff here are super friendly and very professional and courteous even to just a day pass member like myself.

After a hard workout of a couple hours on excellent equipment, the final amenities like a steam room, a dry sauna,  full-size showers, plenty of towels and a large locker room are a blessing.

1.  They were open late on a weeknight, particularly a MONDAY, when 98% of downtown looks like 'I Am Legend'.

2.  Portions are generous.  I ordered Pad Thai for dinner that will persevere to be my lunch for tomorrow.  An order of egg rolls comes in fives.

3.  Prices are reasonable.  I was expecting elevated prices to coincide with downtown rent and Monday convenience.  Chicken Pad Thai was $11 and the egg rolls $5.  Not bad considering that translates to two meals.

4.  Use of space is charming.  Classier than an upscale dive like like House of Nanking, but you can wear flip-flops there.  Looks and feels very Feng Shui'd out, dressed in red and walnut.  

5.  Location is perfect, not only for my situation, but for other downtown denizens.  Its pretty much at Phoenix's 0,0, where all addresses radiate outward unto the gaping depths of the Valley starting from there. 

6.  Most importantly, the food was delicious.  The noodles were moist and heavy while the chicken was light and tender.  I ordered 'medium' spice, but after the dish I was wanting more of a burn.  There was also a shortage of scallions in the dish.  I downed the few present in two small bites.  The veggie egg rolls were tasty, crunchy, and flaky -- almost like a fried spring roll.  I was impressed by the use of pumpkin inside.  The accompanying sweet and sour sauce was much milder that what you typically get beside an eggroll and was a nice pairing.

Our perogies and drinks finally came, our friends nachos were nowhere to be found. The perogies were actually really delicious, creamy inside and nice crunchy fried onions and smoky bacon on top. Our other friends joined us...still no nachos. They ordered drinks and decided on food (a burger I think)...still...no nachos. We inquired again, hey we ordered nachos about 30 min ago... A waitress said she would look into it. Finally food arrived for our starving friends! The nachos although delicious (I tried), weren't likely worth the half hour wait.

After seeing the many comments about how expensive it was we were pleasantly surprised that the prices didn't seem out of whack with other places like this we have visited. We started with the sashimi appetizer for $15. The sashimi was good although it did seem the pieces were a little on the thin side. I had the filet mignon and scallops teppanyaki lunch for $19 and hubby had the shrimp and scallops teppanyaki lunch for $18. You do get a bowl of miso soup to start out with and it was good - as far as miso soup goes. We did not get a salad however. Not sure if they don't serve salads at all or if you just don't get them at lunch. The chef did the usual antics that occur during a teppanyaki dinner much to the delight of a little boy who was seated at the table with us. The food was fine - nothing to write home about but nothing wrong with it either.  Just average run-of-the-mill teppanyaki. Service was also fine - no complaints.

We got there late on a Monday evening at about quarter to eight.  We asked if they were still serving food, and we were told that the kitchen was cutting off orders at eight, and the restaurant closed at nine.  Having walked past many closed restaurants we were down with that.

My wife and I both had the ""Best of"" special which featured Putine, two differents types of smoked meat (one was pork foot), cole slaw, and a pickle.  I forgot to write down what the kids were eating in my notebook - poor me.

The smoked meat was A-freaking-Mazing.  Awesome is too tame of a word to describe it.  The meat was so good that my 2 year old child was fighting my wife to eat her smoked meat.  The smoked pork foot meat was the better of the two, but I could have eaten either for days.  The poutine was the second best poutine that we had during this trip to Quebec.

Charleston, near the Home Depot, but this was our first time to this one (my husband's very 1st time to any U Swirl). We were on this side of town. We also wanted to use one of our coupons from the Entertainment Book (several coupons). 

It's composed of two spaces so there is ample space inside. It's set up like the one on W. Charleston (longer), but just a smidge shorter. Bright green paint inside with some splashes of white, extra large prints of toppings on the walls, tables & chairs, and a long lounger seating area facing the tables & chairs (so if you're sitting here, you might feel like people are looking at you). There are napkins and two different cup sizes. We chose the sixteen ounce cups (the smaller of the two choices). The frozen yogurt flavors follow. The toppings follow. The areas were clean and each cubby hole was filled. So many choices; this is where it gets fun and you can get a little creative. The cashier is at the end, and you place your cup on the scale to get weighed (she gives you the spoons). Present your coupon before paying. Also, a tip jar is on the counter.

I got Island Banana, Reese's Peanut Butter (my favorite here- so good! I'm just getting this flavor next time), and Coconut. I usually get lots of fruit but I just got the strawberry. The others (mango, pineapple) looked a little mushy and in one solid form- don't usually see it like that. The neat thing about this frozen yogurt brand, is there are a nice variety of nuts (peanuts, walnuts, pecans), cereals (cap'n crunch, cinnamon toast crunch), waffle cone (mmm), mochi (love it- it's an asian thing), and candy (mini m & m's, snowcaps). Also, there is a good selection of the frozen yogurt flavors, and if you wanted, you could get the swirl (the one in the middle) of the two flavors together. The fat content is marked on each flavor, at the lower right. It's thirty six cents an ounce here- what a deal! For the both of us, minus the dollar off coupon, it was a little over $6.00.

What kind of restaurant owner lets their kids run wild through a restaurant on a Friday night??? 

We didn't have anyone come over and see us until we had been seated for over 5 minutes, which considering where our table was, we found to be kinda funny. The food was very blah, no flavor! I had a carnitas quesadilla and the only flavor that I could taste was the poblano peppers. My friend had shrimp tacos, she said that the shrimp was overcooked and lacked any sort of flavor. 

It was not a very pleasant experience, even not counting the food. The restaurant had music blasting the entire time, like it was some kind of club or something. Which I thought was funny because just about every table had kids or people over the age of 60 at it, definitely not people that enjoy loud music at a meal!

In the past year, I have had to inform the manager twice of homeless people fighting in the parking lot.

My main issue with not only this location, but Deseret Industries as a whole, is that selection is limited and over-priced. It seems as though when they get a donation, they don't sort through the items very well. I have seen shirts covered in Sharpie, toys covered in boogers, scrapbooks and gift wrap torn to shreds... and yet they still have no problem asking $10 for it.

Lastly, I don't care for the manager of this location. He is always walking around with his slicked-back hair and his walkie-talkie, acting like he's a big-shot CEO of a major corporation, talking down to employees/volunteers and customers. A while back ago I overheard him ""training"" a new employee/volunteer in which he stated, ""Young man, come here... now, I often get asked by so many people what the difference is between Deseret Industries and Walmart. And... pay attention... do you know what I tell them? I tell them... you should probably be writing this down... I tell them that Deseret Industries sells."" It took every ounce of my strength to hold back my laughter.

Another incident with this manager happened a few weeks ago. I was there on a Friday at around 6 pm. I was browsing when I heard the manager come on the loud speaker, ""Attention shoppers!! We will be closing in EXACTLY one hour at 7 pm and we ask that you please start forming a line to check out now, as it gets extremely busy!"" Ummm... what? Never mind the fact that he was basically asking us to leave an hour before closing, but I looked around and it was only me and two elderly people. Yeah... real busy. Fast forward ten minutes later, 6:10, and I'm still browsing, and he comes on the loud speaker once again, and ""reminds"" us to come to the cash register to ""beat the crowds"".

The winner here is the atmosphere, decor and the food. The appetizers (bag of chips and fried okra) were 3 stars. However, the open faced turkey sandwich with greens was a winner for a simple dish. The turkey portion was great with the delicious micro greens on top, a good balance of protein and tasty veggies that's not the typical lettuce, spinach, or arugula.

I couldn't wait to write this review for Alchemy, I was so impressed.  The service was impeccable (excellent kudos to our server Jean), the view was awesome (I can't wait to come here during the day so I can take in what is obvious a breathtaking view), and the food was too die for.

Lets start from the beginning.  My friend Jodi and I walk in to the Copperwynd Resort.  (We did lose our way at first and walked through the pool/gym/spa area.  Seeing this with the views make me - and my friend agreed -  want to stay for a spa weekend.  I think we are going to set this up soon!) Nestled in Fountain Hills, this place is a hidden gem.  I understand how the locals may want to keep this place a secret, but it needs to experienced by everyone. I understand this place was closed for a few months...but Alchemy is back!  Our charming hostess sat us in what seemed to be the best seat in the house.  We were by the window and, while it was dark, you can see the lights of what was just an amazing view.  

The wine list was extensive and it was tough to chose what I wanted to drink.  I chose what was a very delicious Riesling.  

Now, when you make your reservations to have the most amazing dining experience, please make sure that you request Jean (or John - I am assuming it is spelled Jean since he had the most endearing French accent - though one should never assume :)) to be your server.  He made the whole night an event.  He had the best sense of humor and was very attentive.  (And if he is unavailable, there was another server, Jenny who was also very helpful throughout the night) 

Now lets get to the food!  The manager did recommend to us that we needed to try the braised short rib crostini  to start.  Now I am one that will not eat onions....but as it was described to us...it was true:  This dish was a ""party in my mouth"".  The pork rib was cooked just right and it melted in my mouth with the goat cheese and grilled onions.  (I didn't realize that there were onions until afterwards.) 

Next my friend and I split the Iceberg Chopped Salad.  Now...this may be the strangest thing I may ever say...but this was the most delicious salad I ever had!  The lettuce was just like butter...with bacon, goat cheese (Jodi and I requested goat cheese in lieu of the bleu cheese since we are not fans) avocado (again - I don't eat avocados - but I didn't care!  It was THAT GOOD!) and the perfect buttermilk ranch dressing.  I was a fan!

Jodi ordered one of the specials of the night - the Dover Sole stuffed with blue crab.  I had the pan seared halibut with a creamy corn chowder.  We both raved about both dishes.  Cooked to perfection!  

While we were waiting for our desserts (where I was going to find room for this, I wasn't sure) Chef Paul came out to introduce himself.  A very charming man who definitely knew his stuff.  It was such a great added touch to an already memorable experience.  

Jean came out with our desserts.  Now we were in heaven!  The flourless chocolate cake was melt in my mouth scrumptious...but I had this thing for this white chocolate cake that was out of this world!!!  While I am proud that I didn't over stuff myself by finishing the cake...there is a part of me that wished I did.

From beginning to end, the experience at Alchemy was top notch!  Prices were very reasonable, the food and views are just to die for, and I can't stop talking about the best service I had received.  (Remember - Jean or Jenny!!!)

I can't wait to go back - especially for lunch to enjoy the views!  And you need to go there as well to check it out.  Don't worry about the drive....this place is worth it!",2012-01-04 06:17:43

I was greeted instantly at the bar and given a drink menu. I got a Skinny Margarita- very good. Their tequila selection alone takes up 2 of the 6 drink menu pages.

The menu selections were a little limited, in my opinion. I just wanted something quick, but if I came here for dinner I would want some more options. I went with the Lime Shrimp Salad. 

They brought out chips and salsa for me while I waited. The salsa was excellent, there was a little something extra in it, a rich bold flavor. I kept trying to figure out what it was but couldn't put my finger on it. The chips came out in a deep metal bowl with high sides- it kind of looked like a mixing bowl. I thought that was a little weird, like they ran out of bowls and just had to grab something quick.

My salad took a little bit longer than I would have expected a salad to take, but right when I was about to ask about it, it came out, so no big deal. Forgive the squealing but it was SO PRETTY, very nicely plated. I considered taking a phone picture of it for a moment, but then I was too hungry to wait. 

The salad was excellent- lettuce, mangoes, avocados, a very light cilantro dressing, and of course the shrimp, which were well-seasoned. 

I think the menu is slightly over-priced, but I guess that's to be expected for the location, but it's not outrageous. I probably won't be dropping by every day after work for $10 margaritas, but I'll be back for a nice dinner.",2010-10-07 06:49:50

A friend I've known forever was in town with his new wife and he suggested going here.  Craft beer on a hot evening?  I'm in!

We arrived on a Sunday evening around 7:30.  The place still had a fair number of people, but we were seated right away. There ended up being four of us altogether.  Three of us got beer:  the celestial gold, the IPA, and the dunkel.   My friends like the gold and IPA, and I thought the dunkel was very drinkable.

We were all over the map for our dinner selections:  my friend got 2 pierogi appetizers for his entree, his wife got a salad, my other friend who joined us got the fried polenta and a pierogi app, and I got the bison/mushroom meatloaf.

The Pittsburgh salad was exactly what you expected and what most area restaurants sell.  But my friend's wife is from Turkey and had never had this style of salad so she enjoyed it.  The rest of us used to this kind of salad can definitely skip it.

My friend's pierogies I got to sample.  One was a traditional potato and cheese stuffed pirogie the other was a special pierogie with a chipotle pepper stuffing and sauce which was excellent.  Both very solid and you could definitely get 2 apps and turn it into an entree.

My other friend's polenta I did not try but he said that it was very good.  It was in a goat cheese fondue sauce with assorted veggies that looked extraordinarily rich and kind of goopy.  

My meatloaf entree was perfection:  two thick slabs of meat, a generous scoop of homemade mashed potatoes with just enough gravy (it coated everything with maybe a tablespoon on the plate) and a side wilted greens sauteed in some olive oil.  

I opted out of dessert, but my friends ordered mango cheesecake, malted chocolate ice cream, and bread pudding a la mode.  The portions were very large and everyone said that they were good (but probably not spectacular).

Our waiter was very good, checking in on us occasionally, refilling water glasses, but was not in our faces.  

And considering how much food we got, the bill for the four of us--with tip--was under $125.

I'd recommend this place for dinner--especially Sunday, when so many restaurants are closed--to have a beer and a nosh and catch up with friends.",2012-07-16 14:09:27

The atmosphere is really cool - nice outdoor seating area, high tables, low tables, and a couple of booths tucked away.  The service was also very pleasant, with the waitress both attentive and friendly.

As for the food, I went for the bruschetta.  It's about $13 for four pieces, and I thought that it would be four small toast rounds.  Boy was I wrong - it's a meal in itself.  Each bruschetta is about the size of a hand and cut into four manageable strips.  I tried the tomato/mozzarella/basil (my usual standby), brie/apple/fig and ricotta/dates/pistachio.  Although I was afraid of the more ""adventurous"" ones, I wound up liking the ricotta and brie bruschetta even more than the tomato/mozzarella one, which totally held its own.  The quality of the food was great and the combinations were somewhat inventive but also worked really well together.

The past few months I've only been going to this location once a week on Wednesday for spinning or twice if I can make it for the additional Pilates and spinning class on Thursday.

I love how spacious the gym feels with separate yoga studio, group exercise room, spinning studio, circuit training and stretching area.  Lots of modern equipment with TV screens available and a large weight training area.  I don't usually use the equipment, but there never seemed to be a wait to use them because they have plenty.  They also have a juice bar and small food selection for your post workouts.

The women's changing room is a fairly good size with full-size lockers, but can get very busy at peak times between 5pm-7pm.  The renovations to the shower area with more shower stalls was much needed to accommodate more members, plus I like the stall doors concept rather than the curtains or glass walls that some locations have.

Staff over the past year have become more friendly and welcoming without giving the attitude of I don't want to work, but just chat with my colleagues.  The gym has always been kept well and the presence of cleaning staff are regularly visible.

One complaint, they need to invest in new towels since most of them seemed worn out and small.  I'm not a big person at all and I feel the towel barely covers my body.  Walking around naked is not an option because I am sure the other women wouldn't want to see me in my birthday suit.

I had a sky king suite that over looked some of the strip. When I entered the room, the lights came on, music played, and the drapes opened. I think I remember holding up my arms and saying I have arrived!
For a tech conference, this was the perfect room, it was totally geeked out, with touch screen panel that controlled everything. Even the TV had an entire side panel for any kind of video input you wanted to hook up. Even your IPOD could be hooked up to go over the in room speaker system.
I was warned about the fridgerator. It was all weight sensitive. So if you took something out, it kept track of it. It was crazy!
The architecture in the place is pretty crazy. But I enjoyed it.

My only complaint was it was VERY expensive to eat/drink/play here. No tables under 20$ a hand, mixed drinks STARTED @ 15$, bloody mary's ran 18$, a  beer was 8$!

I was hoping it would be more of a cafe where you could sit and hang out - to enjoy the ambiance but they only had a few stools and it didn't even seem to have a restroom. Majority of the patrons came, ordered to go, and left. Which is a bit of a shame because it's super cute and cozy in there. 

I did notice that they sell cold brewed Cartel coffee (awesome!) in addition to the bottled drinks in the cooler but no hot coffees. Also, I have to agree with the woman who posted about not having tap water available. Personally, I believe offering tap water is just a basic gesture of hospitality. 

Enough about what they *aren't* and into what they are - they are an awesome bakery to get some pretty amazing tasty cookies and cupcakes.  Seemed to have more cupcakes than cookies despite the name. Perfect for special occasions, gifts, or to really indulge your sweet tooth.

Not to sound too arrogant, but ever since my friend and I found out about this place, we've tried our best to spread it like a fabulous, delicious disease. I've introduced many a friend to this restaurant, who've in turn introduced their friends, etc. to the point where I'll often run into people I know when eating here.

Why is it so good? It's good because it doesn't try too hard. Manpuku doesn't sell itself on being a ""trendy"" restaurant capitalising on its Japaneseness. (Asian restaurants that play up their own Asianness as 'exotic' just ring warning bells!) Instead they try to be good at what they do, which is make delicious and cheap casual Japanese food not easily found at other Japanese restaurants in Toronto.

I'm too shy to make conversation with the employees but you do see many other regulars who will sit at the bar counter and chat with them.

Don't be surprised then, to come at a time when the place is very busy. The service is usually very good, with the owner and the more experienced waitresses usually being very reliable. Expect longer wait times and reminding them when it's really busy though. Only once recently did we get an obviously-new waitress (I'd never seen her before either), but it wasn't an inconvenience.

Almost all the food is good, I promise. This isn't fine dining, but it's great comfort food. They do a hearty udon soup that I haven't had anywhere else in Toronto. There are also other dishes that are fairly original or are just not common here, like hotate rice and shirauo rice. They also have natto, if that's your thing. I haven't had better takoyaki in Toronto for their price, either.

I was already in NoDa when a friend texted me that Free Range was opening at 5pm on July 3rd, 2015 so I was right there when they opened.  

The brewery is probably the smallest in Charlotte.  Unlike most breweries in CLT, the brewing equipment and the taproom share the same space and there is no real separation except for a sign on a chain.  Still this is a well planned space.  As you enter, the brewing equipment is on the left and the bar next. Table seating is on your right.  There is also a kids area just beyond the bar.  This is the first time I've seen a kids area at a brewery. Maybe this will keep them off of the bar seats?

Anyway, I sat at the bar, looked over the menu and started with the Oyster Stout which was good but not as good as the Bob's Pure Intentions Coffee brown ale which was amazing and what I stuck to for the rest of my stay.

The staff was great although a bit scattered at times. There were 6 people working behind the bar and they often ignored people sitting at the middle of the bar which is where I was  But thankfully I was siting near people who knew the owners and they would flag people down. I chalk this up to opening day chaos. 

This visit was worth the wait. And the best thing is this place is across the street from NoDa brewing....or at least what will become NoDa's second location very soon.

Some people say that the mark of great food is walking into a place where the majority of patrons reflect the food. Here, Chingu is  just that. A vanilla guy walking I to an authentic Korean BBQ joint can be a bit daunting. But no worries, as soon as we arrived, we we warming greeted and attended to hand and foot. Not only describing the food on the menu and various options which all looked awesome, but walking us through the preparation of the BBQ hot plate cooking process.

We started with ordering house made rice wine, which is kept in house for a maximum of two weeks to retain the optimal flavour, which is a fermented rice with a pungent kick. Very unique and delicious. We settled on the bulogi meat and BBQ ribs, prepared on the BBQ hot plate for about $40.00 for both, served with a choice of soup (we order a spicy seafood and tofu o share) and Kimchi on the side. Suffice it to say an ambulance of food for $75.00 all on with tip. 

Seeing my struggle, the lovely waitstaff came by multiple time to help with the preparation of the meat, which we made lettuce wraps which were phenomenal! What a lightly sweet and tangy BBQ flavour. We also mixed with rice and a delicate peanuty flavoured sauce. Lots of food! 

Like the other reviews, this is a.must try spot tucked away at Elgin Mills and Bayview. The same place as Little Caesars. If you want a truly authentic Korean BBQ experience, you just try Chingu. For a first timer like me, you will certainly get a lot of 'hand holding' if you need help with the heat of the BBQ. Everyone is incredibly nice and friendly, and a great option for a date night.

No line, walked straight to the cashier, and in...that had to have been record time for a buffet line! Lunch was on my friend so I don't even know how much it came out to nor did I bother to read how much. Probably wasnt interested as I could forsee myself never coming back anyway.

There are buffets you may try and know...just know...once you have your plate in hand and start doing the slow zombie walk as your eyes wait for something from the warmers to jump out at you...and nothing doesn't. So you forcefully tell yourself, just get something. And I did...

Everything aside from salads because I swear you almost can't go wrong with salads unless the dressing is gross or the salads are wilted...and buffets never screw up on salads...regressing here, okay...everything I had was bland, boring, and dry. That was me trying a dish from every country they offered. I even had a simple rye grilled cheese sandwich or something like that...and THAT was bland, boring, and dry. What the?! Service was typical of a buffet one so no comment. As long as we got our drinks refilled without asking, good enough.

So before I make this long and repetitive, unless you get your food comped here, or you don't want to leave the casino...then by all means. However, if you are coming here from elsewhere looking to eat at a buffet, I won't say DONT...but uhh....you know there are a lot of good places to eat out here.

It is kid friendly (but if you don't want the smoke smell since you do have to go through the casino then not so kid friendly) and stroller friendly.

Grilled sideribs -  Not bad, enjoyed the texture and flavour of the sauce. Ribs were not dry
Steamed black cod - Truffle oil was a nice touch to the cod
Taro fries - these were ok but didn't seem like it was freshly cooked as it didn't come out that hot

Service: Service was slow and not that attentive. Some of the dishes took a long time to come. While I'm sure the server was well-intentioned, we found it strange that she picked up the avocado shell from each of our plates and didn't bother to change the plates.

This is probably one of my new favorite spots downtown. I will be here frequently, and you all should too. They have a nightly happy hour from 8- close and it's got some pretty decent food and drinks on it. The ambiance is absolutely wonderful. It's like modern met nature and had public us as a baby. It's going to make a great study spot this semester. 

       The service is very attentive and accommodating. You order and pay at the counter and they deliver your food to you. Every question I asked had an answer. They understood and accommodated my vegan needs which was a huge plus in my book. The servers wear the coolest aprons I've ever seen. They are all custom and it's a detail I really appreciate. 

       The food... So I ordered the vegan coconut sweet potato soup. It was a large portion and so delicious. The texture was creamy and smooth. It really is on par with the vegan soups that WILD (RIP) had on their menu. The Pinot Gris was on happy hour and it was actually very good. It created a perfect balance of acidity with the sweetness of the soup. I also tried the carrot and beet salad that my friend ordered. It was seriously so delicious and fresh. The colors of the dish were bright and crisp. It had the perfect amount of crunch to balance the smoothness of the soup. Our friend also ordered the tuna melt. He loved it! It came with homemade potato chips. My boyfriend ordered some type of fish dish. He really seemed to enjoy that as well. 

     They have some crafty bottled beers and a variety of wines and champagnes to choose from. They also had a cocktail menu that we weren't aware of until the end that we can't wait to try. The desserts... They brought us out complimentary brookies that everyone went crazy for. I wasn't able to eat them because they weren't vegan, but they looked delicious. They also brought us out a bread pudding to try. Once again... The response was raving at the table and it was finished in no time. It also was not vegan, but everyone said they would order it again. Vegan desserts coming soon guys! 

    The general managers name was Lane. He was such a nice man. You can tell he genuinely cared about his staff and patrons. This detail really makes me wish I could give more than five stars. We can't wait to return to try more of their delicious food and drinks!",2015-06-08 21:14:04

Regardless of your dietary proclivities, Fresh is a great option for dining when you're with people who have a range of needs. (With the exception of hardcore Paleo dieters, as you won't find a scrap of meat or egg anywhere in this place.) 

Portions are gigantic. Every time I visit a Fresh location, I forget how filling the food is and end up ordering far too much food. I came here for brunch recently and ordered the pancake platter, which came with two GIGONORMOUS (and rather heavy) flapjacks, vegan sausage, and scrambled tofu. I could only eat half before wanting to pop open like an overinflated balloon. If you don't have a stomach the size of North Dakota, you may want to consider splitting your meal with a friend. 

Service isn't bad, but the ambience is a bit crowded; the tables are pushed super-close together to cram as many people inside as possible. As such, it does get rather noisy.

While I'm usually not big on the pickled vegetable concept, the seasonal vegetables pickled in sweet rice wine vinegar were admittedly good. They had just the right amount of vinegary saltiness to them and retained their crunch and vibrant color. They were a healthy sort of tasty and visually appetizing.

We also tried the tuna poke, which was a sashimi grade ahi tuna with seaweed salad and apple cucumber slaw with sweet soy and wonton chips. I love appetizers like these and it was indeed good at Umami. A flavorful, yet light way to welcome in the meal.

We of course tried the dumplings and the three sauces: soy vinegar, sweet, and spicy. These were quality. The skin/dough portion was pleasantly thinner than I was expecting and stuffed with much more delicious meat than I had anticipated. 

You definitely can't forget the steamed buns. You know they're good when Umami has a food cart dedicated just to these buns. The melt in your mouth pork belly is my personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with any. The bun itself is served warm and is oh so pillowy. And whether its oven roasted house cured pork belly, koren bbq beef, or fried tofu, they don't skimp on the filling. 

As my main course, I ordered the Umami mushroom arugula salad with shiitake, baby portabello and button mushrooms, red onions, cucumber, and cherry tomato. I also added smoked tofu and a garlic bomb, which is a puree of roasted and powdered garlic. Yep, it's a few full tablespoons worth of pure garlic nirvana. While the salad was smaller in terms of salads, I left satisfied thanks to the intense flavors of the dish.

And the food was also really spot on!!  The star that we ordered was the Hash, which comes with short ribs, a buttermilk biscuit, and an egg as you like it.  Holy moly, was this dish everything!!  The meat was silky and flavorful, the hash was stock full of potatoes, peppers and onions and it was topped off with an amazing sauce.  We talked about how delicious this meat would be in a taco, so perhaps they can make that happen sometime ;)

I had to dock 1 star because our waiter was hard to find at times, but it turns out that was because he was the only waiter for the morning, so that's understandable.  The bartender and host/manager had to cover here and there so that helped.

I definitely recommend checking this place out for brunch sometime!!",2017-02-09 22:05:10

Chicken entree comes with 2 choices for sides. They offer a good variety of side dishes to choose from: rice, potato, chickpea and different salad variety. I would say chicken is above average, nothing to rave about and not bad either.

The steak was better than I'd anticipated, was cooked just how I ordered it and done on a charcoal no less. Basic garden salad, but at least it was fresh. Passable mashed potatoes which were genuine and not from a mix.

We just got back and I must say the place is NOT for healthy eating, no way. We junk fooded ourselves and did the traditional nachos, chicken wings and a Sonoran Hot Dog! Massive calorie overload!, but who eats this every day? A basket of fries were also dropped off with the order, but I guess it pairs with the chicken wings. (When it comes to food, I'm a ""common sewer"" ha ha!) ***YAY nice thick steak fries, I loved that aspect, the shoestring fries sux!***

The decor is casual and fun, TVs everywere and bar looking for the most part. I was surprised how huge it is inside, the building looks smaller from the outside, but indoors there is plenty of seating. There is a guy making fresh tortillas in the back room and you can see the machine that makes the chips, pretty cool. The machine is made by a company called ""Lenin"". Hmmm? strange Russian heritage there somewheres.

Oh yeah, I thought this was funny. I see they have $2 Coronas in cans, so I order one. A few minutes later the waitress goes by and litterally drops the can off on the table. ""Here's your Corona"" as she skampers away. I'm like Whaaaaaaaat? No glass, no lime, not opened, just drop and go! Amazing! I did get some limes and a glass when she passed by again. Funny!

Overall good place and the nachos were not as bad as the previous EARLY reviews makes the place sound. Our traditional nachos didn't have canned cheese on it, although we did have to ask for a side of guacamole and sour cream after we noticed it was missing, but then again it might have been melted all together so that is why it looked it wasn't there. Just ask for some, the bussers are very helpful.

The burger was perfectly cooked, had a nice mix of shredded lettuce with mayo; topped with cheddar but didn't really taste the cheddar . The frittes ( i was told better than Bouchon ..really ? ) very salty and limp but a decent taste and the garlic aioli was packing some serious garlic punch but sorry people, Bouchon still rules the roost. 

The verts w/ lardons was to my liking - the smokiness of the LArdon complemented the verts. The mushrooms were very rich - no shortage of butter sponged by the shrooms - needed some herbs - maybe thyme or rosemary.

So basically if you are paying full price for admission then you are not doing your research on the many promotions that they offer. I have not paid full admission in years.

We love going during the $2 rides and game days and last year we donated six pairs of shoes on that day and got free admission for the wife, myself and son.

DO YOUR RESEARCH FOR ASF PROMOTIONS

We generally go at  the beginning of the day when the fair opens and stay until the sun goes down. The quality of people during the day is better and a course the lines are shorter for food, rides and games.

We are not afraid to be there at night there is just nothing to do that you can't do during the day. The concert line up sucks and I have been going to the fair since the 80's.

We always feel safe and we are white people. LOL.

There is plenty of security and police to give you the ""peace of mind"" but you can have all the police and security you want but if shit is going to go down its gonna go down just like last years teen brawl.

The food is very expensive but if you take into consideration how much the fair charges the vendors just to have the privilege of being able to set up at the fair you can see why food cost so much.

Based on information from the ASF website for vendors they charge a $2,000 guarantee plus 23% of gross sales or after taxes net whichever is greater.

No one says you have to buy food at the fair in fact your allowed to bring food in including drinks just no glass containers.

Bottom line, the fair is fun and the main reason we go is for my six year old son. A smile on his face is all that matters. Do your research and I guarantee you that you can have a great time at the fair and not having to spend your rent or mortgage payment to do it.",2015-03-19 00:44:05

Blinkers-the kind horses wear when racing- are also a good idea. Otherwise you'll find yourself ogling your fellow diners desserts, not wanting to wait for the next trip in to try them.

So pack a bag, drive over to SR, and don't leave until the COPS film crew arrives to forcibly remove you from the premises. That is, if you dont have access to a pickup and wheelbarrow.

I had a group of friends in town for a couple days and we were so happy with our dining experience here that we immediately booked a second visit during their short trip.

Let's get the décor out of the way, because I rarely if ever comment or care much about the ambiance of restaurants - but I love the décor and layout of the restaurant and ambiance here. It is cozy without being confined, intimate without being too loud, and just overall feels romantic. It's such a lovely place to be.

Service is also top notch in every way. With French restaurants, I am always scared of the staff being pretentious or even condescending. Here, the staff are incredibly well-trained and knowledgeable, and show attention to detail while not at all being overbearing or pretentious. The sommelier was wonderful to talk to about wines all throughout dinner, and engaged us with discussions on the various vineyards and regions that his pairing picks were from.

Finally, the best and most important part - food is great. I would describe Le Cirque as top-notch execution with sufficient innovation to keep things interesting. My personal favorites for appetizers were the yuzu hamachi with avocado, the poached egg ravioli with mushrooms, and the langoustines with caviar. For the big dish, I loved the rabbit tasting, duck, and dover sole.

Don't skip the desserts either. Between our two trips we tried every one on the menu and they were all great. My personal favorite was the yuzu, strawberries, and cream served in an ice bowl. Just decadent in every way.

After all the great reviews I read, I truly had high expectations. However, from the moment I walked in, till the moment I left, I waited for something good to come out of going here. 

The beautician who greeted me made a comment where I couldn't tell if it was a compliment or slap in the face ""wow, you have a lot of eyebrows"" - What the hell does that mean?? ANYWAY...

1) For starters, I arrived on time for my appointment with my little sister for a birthday mani/pedi. My beautician however, never arrived. And the other employees had to make due with the support they had. Which meant my sister had to wait a 45 minutes for her treatment to begin. 

The owners daughter handled my pedi- she did a great job and was thorough. Only downside was that she seemed very stand-offish and barely spoke to me. (she might have been upset that the worker never came in and she had to cover, but who knows)

2) UGH! The manicurist was way worse, not only did she insist on filing my nails even though I told her I did not want her to, but she filed them unevenly. She was rude and even when I accidently smudged a nail that she just finished painting she made it very clear that in her facial expression that I had annoyed her. Someone more professional might have said ""dont worry, I'll fix it"" or something to that affect.

3) The only reason this place gets two stars is because the gel design was really good. Thats all. But if you have to spend 2 1/2 hours at a salon with crappy people, it's not worth it at all.

La Palette serves high quality French cuisine and provides a great atmosphere to eat.  The restaurant is not too large and they decorate it with drapes and curtains at the entrance and use dim lighting to create a cozy, romantic ambiance.

La Palette offered a prix fixe combo with an appetizer, a main and a dessert so after debating on various adventurous options (many reviews kindly point out they serve horse meat and other interesting items) on their menu, we decided to go with the combo to try more varieties.

My love she ordered the 'Moules du jour' (mussels), chicken main course and creme brule.  I ordered escargot (snails), duck main course and chocolate mousse.

After a short wait, our appetizers came, along with some bread on the house.  I liked the escargot but found it slightly slimy (yeah snails are slimy).  I really like the mussels (moules du jour) they were delicious and the sauce was excellent.

The duck main dish was was also very good.  I got a nice large piece and it came in a thick, savoury sauce.  I also tried some chicken and it was also tasty.  

Finally.  The desserts came and they were both amazing.  I liked the creme brule a little bit more but both the creme brule and chocolate mousse were excellent.

The negative is that I know I called this location, and I must just assume that the number is forwarded if they don't pickup. The people in the store said this is not the case, and I could be wrong - but I doubt it.

The smoke taste was in every bite, the meat was quality and tasted fresh, the self serve condiment bar was a plus, the red cream soda was a nice surprise. The frys were frys, a little crispy and perfect. 

I will be back and I will get the 1/2lb with extra cheese. I am sure I will be re-rating to a 5 if the staff steps it up too.",2008-12-04 22:52:08

While we had made reservations for a nice steakhouse in Robinson, we were appalled by people in gym clothes and Pjs and had to move our fine dining aspirations to Legume. Best decision ever!! 

Parking is plenty - street, valet (validated) or metered lot. You can enjoy a great date night at Legume and hang out at Butterjoint (restaurant bar next door) after dinner if you wish.

Now it is difficult to review the dishes in a place that changes its menu very regularly as you may not see the same dishes that I ate and enjoyed, so I shall focus on the reasons you should dine at Legume. 

1) This place has been on Pittsburgh Magazine Best Restaurants for atleast 3 years
2) Service is amazing - polite staff, extremely helpful, recommendations are not based on priciest item on the list but that cater to what you want to eat, servers have a good idea of the food i.e. tried and tested, prompt yet not rushed.
3) Farm-to-table restaurant means you get dishes with fresh produce and which are different every time you go there (unless you go there everyday)
4) The food is not that expensive for fine dining
5) You can get the bartender at Butterjoint to whip up a custom drink for you
6) You have some vegetarian options that are just as good as the meat options
7) The Pâté and Crostini is a must try appetizer
8) Chocolate Truffle Cake will melt in your mouth
9) Portions are perfectly sized that will leave you full but not stuffed (assuming you eat 1 appetizer + 1 entree + 1/2 dessert)
10) Chef is a 2013 James Beard semi-finalist for Best Chef - Mid Atlantic (if that rocks your boat)",2014-04-01 06:27:55

As hubby silently rolled his eyes and urged me to rethink my decision while reluctantly  giving in to my wish to go to Primanti, we drove into a crowded parking lot.

Upon entering this sports type bar, the  loud environment with TVs everywhere didn't bode well with me for such a great experience.. I only came for the food, not the noise. Certainly not a place for conversation, but it appears a place for the Pittsburgh fans to hang out. 

  I tried the pastrami sandwich done the Primanti way, with Cole slow and fries on the sandwich. Loaded with Cole slaw and fries (not enough pastrami but they do have a double meat version if you are interested) I found the sandwich to be good, not great.

Today was less busy than I have seen it in the previous 2 times. 

Let me say I'm no expert on afghan food so I can't say how legit it tastes to the real deal. I can say that whatever you order, it will more than likely be fresh and made to order. I ordered the tandoori chicken dinner and it came within a 15 minute wait. You best come hungry if you're ordering the plate, because it's a lot of food. Everything taste fine for what it was (spiced meat, rice and salad). 

Keep in mind it is a fast food place with a terrible way to put your dishes near the swinging garbage door, especially when they are stacked high.

I've been told this is the best place for kebob in Toronto, but i wouldn't travel very far to go here but it is definitely a good choice in an area surrounded by fast food.",2011-08-25 17:25:37

They have a huge menu with many different types of foods for any of your picky friends. You're bound to find something you and your friends will enjoy! The awesome part for my friends and I is the Vegetarian and Vegan menu! Which makes choosing foods easy since I won't necessarily have to read all the ingrediants on the list if I order anything off that menu. 

We came here on a Tuesday which is Tequila and Taco Tuesdays! They have 2 for 1 shots of any of the Tequilla and 3 tacos for $6 or $7 depending on the type of meat you get. Not a bad deal! I was with a group of 10 people sooooo we decided to order food as a group and share. Basically we got the Nacho party platter, it was larger than anyone expected.....safe to say we didn't finish it, lol. I didn't get to try any of it, but everyone had their own favorite since it contained four different nachos they have. We ordered around 4-5 plates of the tacos and then the vegan nachos. 

I did try the vegan nachos and that was delicous! It had all my favorites, daiya cheese, beans, corn, mild salsa, guacamole, and fake meat =P that's all I can recall. It's enough to share between two people! 

Oh and we also got Chips & Salsa, but I requested hot salsa and I was disappointed when the hot salsa tasted like mild salsa to me. Even asked for extra habeneros but apparently they don't offer that. The waitress was kind enough to bring some other hot sauce which was good, but not spicy sooo that was a bust. 

Add a couple of rounds of drinks and we were all set! I think we stayed past closing time, but we weren't kicked out and they never said anything to us which was awesome! We didn't even realize otherwise we would have been out the door 10 minutes before closing. Props to them for letting us hang out longer without distrubing our fun!",2014-11-13 01:57:03

I like this fast food joint! It's in plaza right beside subway and a shawarma place in a commercial area.

Menu is simple, mostly Tikka Hut type street food.  Ordered a Chicken Tikka wrapped in Naan ($7.99) and a Paneer Tikka on white basmati rice ($9.99). Cooked on live charcoal!

Chicken Tikka was awesome! Portioned a bit smaller then a shawarma (since it's right next door).  Has that Indian spice flavour! Chicken was thick and tender (textured like breast).

The veggies they stuffed into the wrap deserves props! The cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, herbs were FINELY chopped!! As opposed to diced size, which says something about their prep work!

The paneer basmati rice was portioned nicely! Paneer blocks were big chunks! Again, props to the veggies. Could have used a bit more time on the grill.. Ordered it spicy.. wasn't enough heat for me.. but they cater to non-Indian clientele.. not say say there weren't Indian customers.

Our server was excellent , super friendly but she was one of only 2 servers working the shift. She said ' management' let the other servers go home. I guess they're running things as lean as possible. I would question the wisdom of this policy. With slightly brisker service we would have ordered more drinks etc, multiply a few drinks by a few tables and you surely make more profit than you would save by sending home a couple of servers an hour early. The manager here is clearly not seeing the bigger picture. 

Anyway the food; We started with Kobe Skewers and Edamame , both excellent . Kids had quesadilla and noodles with grilled chicken. Both veery good indeed. I had chicken pizza on Artisan Crust , very light and tasty. I would recommend but I don't know how they charge $2 extra for the crust .

Shio vs Shoyu - which one should you order?
My friend and I were set on trying the signature clam broth ramen, because that's what they are known for. I got the Intense Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen as that's supposed to be more flavourful (I got influenced by some of the reviewers saying the ramen is tasteless so I ordered the more 'intense' one) and my friend ordered the Shio. We both like the Shio more because you can taste the clam flavour more. You can still taste the clam in Shoyo but it's not as obvious because of the soy sauce. I am absolutely hooked with this light clam soup base and did I mention truffle oil? They add that in the ramen which makes it even more flavourful!! I also like the noodles they used which is more Soba-like and matches the light soup base well. Note that portion is a bit small and it doesn't come with an egg (you gotta add it).

Overall I loved the clam soup base and will definitely return to this restaurant!",2018-02-11 08:36:38

On the note of Mad House... this must mean other people really like it a lot cause it was super packed and just elbow to elbow.  

The food to me was very generic, instant mashed potatoes, canned corn, over cooked rice ect.  The food did not bring a wow factor to me.  I did enjoy the chocolate fountain and the fresh fruit.   The salad bar was nice also.  

It was extremely busy and hard to get in to the food. It was a little scary to walk with a plate of food because everyone was bumping into each other.  I did not see a drink soda fountain which was a down fall because you have to wait for the poor over welmed waitress that was loosing her mind with so many people to try to get to.  

The floors where messy due to it being so packed and it made the place look nasty.

When we walked in we were warmly greeted and the staff was really helpful at showing us around to see what they had to offer.  I wanted to see what they were all about prior to my two sisters flying in to Phoenix to figure out my dress and their dresses for the big day.

They had a lot of options as far as bridesmaids dresses, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for as far as style and feel. It seemed like it might be difficult to get everything figured out since I have bridesmaids living in three different states all over the U.S. and they wouldn't all be able to try the dresses on until they were already ordered - so this place didn't work out for my needs, but it was a great concept!

It was cute. We were seated and promptly given menus. I ordered a typical breakfast(scrambled eggs and pancakes, hash browns). My traveling partner ordered  steak, eggs, and hash browns.

The pancakes were equally eek and they felt like bricks hitting the bottom of my stomach, just heavy and tasteless no matter how mud I tried to make them edible, I just gave up.

I came here for a girlfriend's birthday. We are not fussy eaters so the birthday girl told the chef (Danny) to make what he felt like serving us; family style. Danny is an amazing person, hands down. Makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk into the resto. Greeted us with open arms (literally) and a huge smile. Love this guy. Love the staff. Amazing people.

Our first round consisted of Oysters of the day, Tuna and Tahini sashimi, salad with prosciutto. The bread and butter was amazing. Super fresh. The oysters were ok. I thought they were a tad dry, to be honest with you. Never had that happen to me. Tuna and Tahini sashimi was delicious.

For your second serving, we were presented with clams, lobster with mash, cauliflower in cream sauce and fried chicken. I'm not a fan of clams so we will pass right over that. The lobster with mash was very tasty but there was barely enough lobster for 4 people. Actually, there wasn't enough lobster for 4 people. The cauliflower wasn't anything to rave about but the fried chicken was quite good. I mean who doesn't like anything fried?

Finally, our last course included whole sea bream, mushroom risotto and 14 ox faux filet with potatoes. I'm not a risotto person but it was quite tasty and enjoyable. The whole fish and steak on the other hand was terrible. The fish smelled and tasted so fishy that I could not get my bite down. The steak was extremely fatty and although the glaze that was placed on top was delish, the steak itself wasn't anything to rave about.

Finally, the desserts. If I'm not mistaken, we tried a bit of everything but seeing as we never saw the menu, I have no idea what they usually serve (it was my first time). We had their home made Ferrero rocher, sponge toffee, home made marshmallow, their pancakes, homemade cookies and chocolate ganache tart. Their pancakes are a must try!!

It was lunch time and I was on the hunt for Barbecue. For some reason when I reached the car in the parking lot my first thought was Dickie's.  However, I really do like to keep things local and while Dickie's is a decent little chain, I thought it was time to go and try Kinfolk again.  When you go there, you go for the food. The ambiance is nice and all but it isn't what is bringing people in. What is bringing people in is the huge portions and reasonable prices. I ordered ""the pig"" (pulled pork sandwich) and I chose the corn on the cob as my side.  Before I even ordered the hot, fresh cornbread was already out at the table.  Unfortunately there was no whipped butter to go along, just the single serving packet that came with it, but the corn bread was still warm and soft and delicious.  After ordering the food, I got right up and filled up my mason jar with root beer from the fountain and then waited the 7 or 8 minutes for the food to come out.  I am going to admit right now that it has been some time since I thought about turning in my man card because of a meal, but there was no way I was able to finish the entire corn on the cob (which seemed to be crispy and fried which was something new for me) and the enormous pork sandwich that was served on a warm buttered bun and probably weighed in easily at over a pound.  I managed to eat most of the meat out of the sandwich and it was juicy and smoky but maybe slightly a little too chopped up for my liking however it was still amazing.  I did finish the corn (at least I finished my vegetables) and still have half a sandwich left for dinner.  Before I left, 3 of Scottsdale's men in blue all came in and ordered half a sandwich and fries. I am thinking that if these guys are all ordering the fries, there has to be something to them and I am going to have try them next time and definitely stick to just half a sandwich. Plus a half sandwich also saves me 2 bucks.  But I still got out of lunch today for 10 bucks which included the corn bread, the corn on the cob, the huge sandwich, unlimited fountain drinks from and with tax and tip so the deal is there.

The beef brisket burger was just alright.  The blue cheese was overpowering and my beef patty was not very juicy.  The proportion size was filling.  The frites were ok, nothing special.  Guess it would have been wiser to order something other than the burger at a place like this but I wasn't feeling anything else at the time.  

I tried my friend's braised beef short ribs over pappardelle which I also found to be just average.  The flavor was too one dimensional and I could see myself getting bored with the dish very quickly in favor of something else. 

For both dishes they used quality ingredients but it seemed like they did not know how to work the ingredients together very well.  

As for the ambiance, it was clean cut and modern but not too memorable in my opinion.  The service was good, the waiters and greeter were pleasant.

I will likely go again at some point to try their salads, namely the lobster and the crispy duck salads, both of which i've heard good things about.

When we got there, we were the only customers, which seemed very odd.  Our waiter was helpful, but he told us the menu was going through a transition and they would no longer be serving fish.  I also noticed our bill/receipt listed Mizan as the restaurant, not The Levant, so perhaps there are more changes coming?

The restaurant was beautiful - dark and intimate with Lebanese-inspired furniture.  We skipped an appetizer since most of the appetizers were also sides, and the entrees all came with two sides.  We ordered the lamb kabob with hummus and potato and the chicken kabob with falafel and mihammara.  

The food was delicious, but I'm still perplexed about why no one else was there.

Let me put it this way, you're in yorkville. You've got luxury shops all over so expect the price point to be somewhat inflated. IF you 're mind set is like that, you will absolutely be fine. 

How does the food taste? Well, it's okay. WE had the karate to start. It was crispy yet tender. The wagyu beef rice was good but a tad over seasoned. Not bad but I don't know if I would order it again. For dinner we ordered a whole bbq fish. It was also okay. I truly wanted it to stand out more instead. For dessert, we had one of my favourites of the night, mochi ice cream. Loved it.

I also enjoyed the Flight of the reishi. A lychee drink. We had 2 versions - one with alcohol and alcohol free version (just ask for it - its possible).  We had three of these.

I was having a hard enough time choosing a flavor when I noticed there was an additional case of flavors on the other side of the counter. How the heck was I going to choose without trying everything? For some reason I always feel guilty trying samples at these types of places.

I felt rushed and it had nothing to do with the great staff. Had to do with the 5+ person line that stayed constant the entire time we were at the parlor. I could feel them breathing down the back of my neck waiting for their fix.

I tried:
Avocado Jalapeno:
Sweet rich creamy avocado flavor. I've now tried this in ice cream and gellato form and I gotta say its an amazing flavor. At first I was disappointed because all I had was a sweet/fat/avocado flavor but then at the very last minute I caught the spice and very green/chlorophyll flavor from the jalapeno. In hindsight this was probably a bad choice for my first taste since its a stronger flavor. Think I fried the taste buds.

Honey Lavender:
Had I tried this first I probably would have enjoyed it more. I got the sweetness from the honey but the lavender was lost on me. Probably due to the avocado/jalapeno I tried before.

Irish Cream + Jameson:
By this point I was so lost as to what I actually wanted I went with the standby of asking the lady at the counter what her favor was. Expecting her to tell me everything she said nope.. avocado/jalapeno and ""Irish Cream/Jameson"" now the flavor tag only said Irish cream. My brain was trying to crunch what irish car bomb ice cream would be like. It was delicious caught both flavors and neither was overpowering.

They had peanut butter and coconut which would normally be what I would get but I felt I already stole enough counter time and went with the avocado/jalapeno and Irish cream/Jameson. Of course now I remember seeing a chocolate/Guinness which would have been perfect with the irish cream/Jameson that really would have been an ice cream irish car bomb. Next time!

I knew they had bacon brittle and there was no way I wasn't getting a bag of that. I would recommend eating this last because again its very strong and I think overpowered the taste buds and the rest of the ice cream lost some of its flavors after that. If your smart just have your ice cream BEFORE you even get the bacon brittle because there's no way you wont tare into it if its in your hands. I don't even think I made it to the register before I was into my bag.

This stuff was amazing. Large chunks of smokey bacon in perfectly caramelized sugar. Thank god for this new bacon craze because it really does make everything better.

Locally sourced all natural ingredients. Everything made in house from the brownie toppings to the whipped cream.Thanks a lot sweet republic.. you ruined all other ice cream for me. *shakes his fist*",2010-03-14 17:06:24

When planning this first date rendevous, I was at a loss as to what ""activity"" we should partake in. Again, as in part 1, I mentioned that James L. had never been to Nevada so I was stuck with the guy's job of putting together an iternerary. What to do, with a film major, in Vegas for the first time, if gambling, clubbing, shopping and sexapalooza aren't really too appealing? Of course there's always highschool date things such as, bowling, ice skating, mini golf, but, alas, that's not too appealing to me. I thought a drive-in theater would be a fun experience. I grew up going to them and he had never been to one, so the choice was made.

After getting more comfortable over Morroccan fare, James and I headed on over to the drive-in to see Unstoppable and Wall Street II. I'll admit, I love drive-ins and for $6.25 for THREE movies, going to a regular brick and mortar theater to see a first run movie is out of the question, for me. Even in this economy, it's cheap enough that nobody will have to ride in via the trunk (wink wink)

So we got there just in time to start watching Unstoppable at 7:30. We were too busy doing what people do at drive-ins (no, not sex or starting fights - we're not in The Outsiders) so I can't tell you what the first half of the movie was about. It was too cold to sit outside to watch the movie and the view from his tiny Pontiac coupe made watching (again, we're both fairly tall) the movies a bit difficult. Let it be known that there are no radio boxes so either bring a stereo with tons of batteries or, of course, use your car's stereo to listen to the movie. 

During intermission we headed off to the respective gender separate bathrooms which were, SURPRISE, ACTUALLY CLEAN! Wow. The running joke between my sister and me is to describe a place being ""as dirty as a drive-in theater bathroom."" Well, not this place. It was really decent. So James came back with nachos and a raspberry tea (gross, but unlike every other Southerner on the face of the planet, I hate sweetened teas, so pardon my disgust.) and we started watching Wall Street II. We left about an hour before it was over because, well, there were more pressing matters to attend to (again, not sex or starting fights ala The Outsiders.) 

I'd definitely go back here again with some (less sexy) friends along with a cooler full of food to enjoy a movie (or three!) out here again. Check it out!",2010-11-22 20:09:22

Even during the hustle and bustle of Queens Feast Restaurant Week we enjoyed a relaxing meal and interesting drinks.

Raw oysters for an appetizer was a great way to start before traditional shrimp and grits, but it was the chocolate pecan bread pudding that stole the show. A rectangular slice that was equally sweet and gooey, I definitely wanted a nap afterwards. My dining companion ordered the lemon tart for dessert and when the crust was too hard to even be cut through with a knife the server kindly brought us another order of the bread pudding, which had a bit of a different texture, as it was sliced from a new part of the pan, so the variety in experience was a welcome surprise!

Left Hand's milk stout on nitro pour is always a welcome option on a tap list and a good substitute for the Flying Dog oyster stout that was on the menu. Fun cocktails and true-to-Uptown experience.

I came here a couple days after they started their soft opening. Decor is very clean and minimalistic. 

The folks working there are Vietnamese and I can tell that they are very passionate about their food and business in general. 

We tried several things here after coming here twice:

Pho (3.5/5.0) - Their broth is clean with an overall sweeter taste. It comes down to preference but I prefer a more savoury broth. Not bad nonetheless and you won't come out feeling thirsty. I believe they are looking to offer a choice of fresh and dry noodle in the future as well. I find the noodles a bit on the softer side. I prefer some bounce and texture to the noodle.

Bun Rieu Cua (3.0/5.0) - I could taste the tomato and crab paste but it was quite subtle. Perhaps it may be due to the fact that it was only available for weekends and I requested it on a Monday. I do prefer the one at Bong Lua over this one as it is much more flavourful. 

Skewers (4.0/5.0) - The unique thing about this place is that they also focus on BBQ. My favourite was the pork belly which was super flavourful and juicy. Texture was also perfect. The beef ribs were also good too. It comes with a chilli fish sauce dip which adds another level of tastiness.

Grilled Porkchop and Chicken Rice (3.0/5.0) - The porkchop that they used was lean so after being grilled, it became fairly dry. Perhaps this could be much improved if they chose different cuts. Chicken was better but could have also been a bit more juicy. The fried egg was done very nicely. I like the egg they have used as it is on the orangey-yellow side.

Service was great overall and the people working there are definitely a friendly bunch. Apparently they have been in the restaurant business for quite some time. This place has a lot of potential to become one of the top Vietnamese restaurants in the area once they fine tune a few things.",2018-05-29 01:44:22

Our server was nice, but a bit on the snobbish side. When it was time to order drinks, he said he was very knowledgeable about wine, and if we told him what entrees we were thinking about ordering, he'd suggest something complimentary. Thank you very much, but you are assuming we aren't knowledgeable. Hmmm.  When we did order wine (before he took our entrée order), he acted a bit 'uppity', as if slighted that we didn't rely on his knowledge. Granted, this is just my perception and I'm willing to admit I might have read him wrong but his attitude rubbed me wrong.

The bustling kitchen produced mediocre food this visit. The place is always busy, but the mall is a goldmine, so a restaurant has to try to fail. Plus, it is very LOUD! Difficult to carry on a conversation, so if you want that, and the weather is nice, get a table outside. The décor is nice, rustic-like, but very trendy (and hipster). Additionally, the place is pretty pricey - but most Fox restaurants tend to be.

I you like pesto, order the Chicken Pesto Pasta and you'll get your pesto! Wow. Couldn't finish this green dish.  Heavy on the pesto, and very unattractive presentation. The Ricotta Gnocchi was good, but again, looked like a blob in the bowl. Spicy shrimp looked the best and of the three entrees, tasted the best (although not awesomely delicious.)

I found my group pretty quick and then after I settled in my seat, and got my date situated (my 8 month old grandson)  I looked around the joint, I like it, it has a nice opened feel, maybe a little hipster, but I dig it!

I knew before I got there what I wanted, I wanted The Bear, I had a taste of it awhile back and had been craving it since then! 

Let's stop for a minute and discuss the Bear, where did they come up with this idea? Who said let's make a hot dog, and then place it on naan bread, then top it with smoked Gouda, Bacon, Bbq Sauce, Peanut Butter and some Cracker Jacks for kicks! Whose idea was this, and who 2nd it?????  I know if I came to the table with this for my kids, they would think I was smoking something! Short Leash Dogs are geniuses!  

The Bear is amazing!!! My dog was a brat, and it was smothered in bbq sauce, peanut butter, Gouda cheese, BACON and yes even the cracker jacks and blanketed in Naan bread!! This is the most amazing hot dog I have had so far!  Just mind blowing how the combinations of everything blend together. Also my bear came with a nice little green salad, eating the salad made me feel less guilty about eating the dog haha got some healthy stuff with it! 

For the little guy I ordered the corn dog bites, though he only ate 1  1/2, he dug the corn meal crust of the dog, devoured that up quickly.  He has 6 teeth and knows how to use them. He wasn't a fan of the jalapeno cheese stuffed dog, but I can safely say, that's pretty banging dog!  Might have to try it out as a Moki, yes I think that's what I'll try next!

Spiced Pumpkin Cappuccino with Warm Gougere:
A frothy pumpkin soup with a small cheese pastry. Just a few sips and you're done. Great warm cappuccino and the gougere was tasty. 4/5

Escargots au Beurre d'Ail:
Burgundy snails in garlic herb butter with confit tomato, croutons and Parma prosciutto. One of my favorite things is escargot. Generous portion of garlicky buttery and slightly crisp escargot. I was dipping my bread in garlic butter after I was done with the escargot. 5/5

Hamachi:
Yellowtail marinated in citrus with avocado, heart of palm, cucumber and orange blossom smoke. The presentation was very nice. Orange blossom smoke coming from the bottom of the plate. The hamachi is fresh. 5/5

Filet de Loup de Mer:
Potato crusted Mediterranean sea bass with braised leeks and Pinot Noir reduction. One of Le Cirque's classic dishes. The crust was so light but slightly crisp. The Pinot Noir reduction was amazing with the fish. 5/5

Degustation de Porc Berkshire:
Pork chop, soy-glazed pork belly, butternut squash puree, truffled haricots tarbais, marjoram cider cream sauce and chestnut confit. The highlight of this dish was the pork belly - it was tender and melts in your mouth. 5/5

Petite Boule de Chocolate, Eclats de Noisette Caramelisee, Glace Chocolat Blanc:
Chocolate ball with praline mousse, hazelnut caramel crunch, white chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce. You get a ball of chocolate with gold leaf on top and your server will pour hot chocolate over the chocolate ball causing it to melt parts of it and exposing the hazelnut crunch and ice cream. 5/5

Foret Noir dans sa Boule de Sucre, Cerises Morello en Kirsch, Cacao Sorbet:
Black Forrest crumble in sugar sphere, cocoa sorbet and Morello cherries in Kirsch. This was my sister's choice for dessert since she likes black forest. The presentation was fantastic. You get a red ball made of sugar and inside it is all the goodies. The cherries were a bit too bitter and medicine-like for me so I didn't like this dessert but then again, this was not my choice. If you like black forest then you'd probably like this.

Petit Fours:
Chocolate with gold leaf, marshmallow, lemon blueberry and profiteroles. My favorites were the chocolate and the profiteroles. 4/5

Some advice for Black Angus wait staff:

As always, keeping my water glass from being empty and not assuming that we've come to your restaurant to make friends with wait staff are keys to a larger tip. Lastly, I am not an eating machine so wasting my time pushing appetizers and dessert always lowers the tip. We've come to your restaurant to eat, converse, and have a nice time without intrusions, more interruptions do not equal better service, especially when the place is practically empty and staff are easy to alert.

rkNHwsythOGQJtE2_UutUw,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,4,10,3,8,"Located at the far south end of what most people consider ""The Strip,"" a concealed attachment to Mandalay Bay, lofty price point and lack of gambling making it the sort of hotel inhabited by mostly well-heeled jetsetters, it seems safe to say that Four Seasons Las Vegas is not a place most tourists will seek out, yet for over a decade Charlie Palmer Steak has stood its ground despite no lack of nearby competition.

Styled as a classic American Steakhouse and one of five for the restaurateur behind Aureole, a location directly off the lobby and next to Veranda placing the deceptively intimate room in prime position for those arriving via Four Seasons valet or the Mandalay Bay staircase, it is immediately upon approach that guests are greeted by a hostess at the podium, her subtle manner of dress and waiters in suits a far cry from the short skirts and jeans worn elsewhere and largely mirrored by diners.

Elegant without being 'stuffy,' subdued lighting and linens mixed with leather, wood and patterned carpets creating a refined ambiance that is unfortunately subverted by overly loud pop-tunes and the gleam of sports television at the bar, it was shortly after seating at a rounded booth that a man approached offering Cocktails, the list of top-shelf classics enticing but set aside in favor of the Sommelier-suggested Wine Pairing.

Probably best-known by 'foodies' for the ""Cut of the Week"" Tasting menu, a three-course Prix-fixe that changes weekly and offers Salad, Beef, Sides, Wine and Dessert for just $58 per person, it was after perusing options that the decision was instead made to give the kitchen carte-blanche, Chefs Eduardo Lalo Saavedra and Tomas Espino rolling out a nine-course Dinner over the course of 130 minutes.

Not the sort of place for tableside theatrics or imaginative reinterpretation, Charlie Palmer's self-designated ""Progressive American"" cuisine instead focused on pristine ingredients treated with respect to yield great flavor, it was with a glass of Rose that house-baked Bread arrived prior to course one, the small cubes of Cornbread sweet, crumbly and addictive while others were soft and fluffy, the arrival of Chef-selected Sashimi unfortunately leaving little time to enjoy the sparkling Val de Mer as drapes of Yellowtail and Hamachi dressed lightly with Soy paired far better with a semi-sweet Riesling.

Making short work of the six slices of Fish with Chopsticks and finishing the Wine sip-for-bite, the pours requested as half-normal volume given limited tolerance, it was with golden 2015 Kracher Beerenauslese coating the palate that Chef Saavedra's Torchon of Foie Gras was spread on buttered Toast, the classic pairing expectedly working well as did White Grenache with Short Rib Ravioli, though the texture of the filling was a little dry and may have been better were the Meat shredded.

Progressing a little too quickly, the presentation of a Bibb Lettuce Salad with Beer that was declined in favor of unpleasantly sour Sauvignon Blanc providing an opportunity to slow the kitchen down by cutting Greens at a leisurely pace, it was shortly after the last bits of smoky Bacon were forked up that a generous slice of Ora King Salmon was joined by 2016 Talley Chardonnay, the smooth citrusy profile playing exceptionally well off the flaky Fish and also quite nicely off wilted Chard dressed in vibrant Vinaigrette.

Marking the final savory course with a serrated blade and Syrah, an off-menu array of Charlie Palmer Steak's Prime USDA Beef accompanied by two ounces of A5 Kagoshima Wagyu plus Root Vegetables, Mushrooms and Truffles one of the most beautiful and delicious Steak presentations in recent memory, it was as Coffee was offered that the Sommelier presented 2014 Dashe Late Harvest Zinfandel, the thick Purple Wine from Sonoma County creating a sort of Peanut Butter and Jelly combination with Charlie Palmer's ""Candy Bar"" though perhaps a bit too heavy for the Mango Panna Cotta that is virtually weightless but texturally pleasing in support of Sorbet and cooked Persimmon.

Unable to pass-up Apple Pie, the ten-minute baking time welcomed as Coffee was sipped at the end of a fairly heavy and fast meal, it should probably be unsurprising that Charlie Palmer Steak's version of the American classic is a beautiful rendition given the quality of his produce, but the true star of the show is actually the tangy Crème Fraiche Ice Cream that makes a fine dance partner for Brown Butter Streusel and Caramel.

****Easily seen as just another 'me too' Steakhouse in a city where every hotel has to have one, but in reality the sort of contemporary American restaurant where great ingredients are showcased in a manner that is accessible to a wide variety of customers at a price that is far more accessible than many, Charlie Palmer Steak has withstood the test of time for good reason and with Chef Saavedra at the helm there is no reason to think that is going to change anytime soon.",2018-01-21 17:52:38

I finally got to try the hype! I have heard about this place over and over again, and the last time I visited this plaza, it was closed for New Years! 

Anywho, my friends and I came on a Saturday night, around 11 PM, it was pretty packed! I ordered The Alley Trio Milk Tea, it cost about $5.50 + tax for a regular. 
The trio milk tea came with, a milk tea base, tapioca and a variety of fruit jellies. I usually get my drinks with no sugar and ice ~ that's how I like it, and it's usually sweet enough with the coat of sugar on the tapioca and jellies. My first reaction after taking a sip of the drink was, boy, there is no taste! The milk tea literally tastes like water ~ mind you, I had no ice to water it down! It tasted like water, with a hint of milk... to add to it, the assorted fruit jelly made the drink taste... very weird ~ if you like mixing fruits with milk, by all means, but for me, it did not taste so great!

Anyways, they have many more variety of drinks, but I will be hesitant on trying their milk teas after the very watery, tasteless milk tea that I got.

When I was done being my former self and wanted the same color as the model on the cover of Vogue, again, no problem. When I've handed her pictures I've pulled out of magazines and said, ""I want this blonde!"", she has handed the pictures back and said, ""You do understand that this model is a red-head, correct?""

So, she is helpful without being insulting....I would have said to me...look you eegit, you'll get the hair color you look best in and shut up about it....Explains why I'm not a stylist, though I have a lot of ideas.

Lee's Sandwiches will one day be an international phenomenon. Now I'm not on the bandwagon yet because of several key concepts, but I consider Lee's Sandwiches the Starbucks/McDonald of Vietnamese fast food. Not to say I'm against or for fast food chains, I simply respect success. Keep in mind how many people these chains employ and the salary and benefits they provide vs horribly ran, no customer service mom and pop places. 

Vietnamese food really have the potential to be as mainstream as say American, French, Italian, Mexican and Chinese cuisine. But sadly, what really holds it back is the concept. Most great Vietnamese chefs don't understand that style is as equally important as flavor profile. The rare greats that do understand, like the An family with the Crustacean (http://www.anfamily.com/Restaurants/crustacean_beverlyhills/displaypages/homepage.html) chain is simply killing it. 

So ask yourself this. Would any non-Yelpers (Westerners), or even Yelpers that's not adventurous , dare step foot in a place like Dakao, or Pho Hue Thai and order Banh Mi?

I think Lee's Sandwiches is fantastic for what this city needs. It's a slap in the face for all the local shops to kick it up a notch (mainly Decor and customer service). It's a wake up call to say that good food is no excuse for poor overall dining experience. 

In conclusion, this Lee's offers way too many choices for their own good. Less is more. Just look at Chipotle.",2011-03-21 05:40:08

The bubble tea is always delicious at Chatime and this place is no exception. The tapioca is very fresh and was sweet and chewy; just how I like it.

Note: their drinks with regular sugar are very sweet, probably to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. I generally like sweet drinks, but it was still way too sweet for me. I went with half sugar, and since the tapioca is already sweet, it was perfect.

Also, I highly recommend trying red bean as a topping if you want to try something new. I tried it for the first time here and I LOVED it. A new favourite.

The only thing that kind of bothered me during 1 visit here was how one of the workers behind the counter was yelling really loud for some reason, and was dropping the f-bomb multiple times in a screechy voice.

Older review

What a fun find.  The guy that was on the counter was so friendly and inviting. Nothing was to impossible for him tondo to make the eating experience great.  Great employee !!!!

I had the chunky steak pie along with a lamington. Others in out party had the steak and mushroom pie along with sausage rolls. 

The puff pastry was amazing. Some of the best I have ever tasted in a pie. There was no fatty feeling on the roof of your mouth after you ate. I found out that the puff pastry is made in house. 

The pie was tasty. My favourite pie. , mince meat ( hamburger) was all sold out...... Bummer 

The lamington was excellent as good as any you would find in Australia. It was made with a white cake base rather than a yellow...... White cake is so much better in a lamington.  

My only suggest would be to have the pies served at a hotter temperature. I know not is a fine line between just right and scalding hot   Slightly hotter would have been better.

Located on the 2nd floor, this small place does pack quite a punch.  Their chairs are actually stools but have a cutout at the bottom where you can slide your purse right in - genius! 

They have daily specials and since we were here on a Sunday it was their premium night specials.  The table ordered a few different items- horse meat sashimi, beef carpaccio, chicken skewers and some sort of burger (name I have forgotten).  These dishes are more tapas style than a full meal.  I had the skewers and the beef carpaccio.  They were good but after eating at Nana's earlier in the day...well it just can't compete.  The beef wasn't sliced as thin as carpaccio should be and was a bit tough for me.

The service was polite but they forgot to bring a few people's green tea and we had to ask twice.  It wasn't crowded but it was late Sunday night so maybe this is normal so we ordered and our food came out pretty fast.

I am increasingly finding their plates to be delicious - very full of ""wok air"", and very flavorful! Some dishes can be a hit or miss, but the sweet and sour pork, pepper pork steak, and some other classics are always on point.

Today we decided to come for lunch. We each ordered our own meal (three lunch sets plus a noodle soup in total; we got the Cantonese fried chow mein, salted fish and chicken fried rice, seafood Taiwanese fried rice noodle, and braised Taiwanese beef noodle soup), thinking that they would be smaller portions to accommodate for lunch. We were therefore pleasantly surprised to find that the sizes were humongous!! We honestly packed a full two boxes to go. That's how much food there was!

The Cantonese fried chow mein was perfectly crisp - the entire base was golden and crispy. The salted fish and chicken fried rice was delicious, and while other restaurants typically skimp out on the salted fish, Golden Moon added a lot! The beef noodle soup was also good, though I found the noodles too soft and overdone. The Taiwanese fried rice noodles, however, was slightly underseasoned. It would have benefited from more salt, and definitely tasted a lot better once I added some chili oil!

Now they hardly offer any which is why they get 3 stars from me.  They went from offering cycle classes twice a week down to once a week on a Tuesday which was fairly popular to moving it to a Monday to now none in evenings at all.

What I do like about this gym is it's never crowded even at what would be considered prime time at other facilities.  There is a steam room in the women's locker which I know some locations that is coed option.  It's always clean, people tend to put their dumbbells back in the proper place and the staff is friendly.

At the window I start my order and after every single item it was like he wanted me to stop ordering already.. I understand I had a large other but, am I bothering you with my spending money at your establishment? The order was repeated back and all seemed correct.

My order: a mini blizzard, a medium blizzard, and a large blizzard, also a root beer float, buster bar, large coke and a sundae.

Get to the window, pay.. Wait for my order and see 3 younger guys working. One actually making my order, the other who knows, and the one who took my order was literally dancing around in plain view. 

After a semi long wait I get my order and tell him I'm missing the large blizzard. Although he repeated it back some how he didn't add it to my order so no big deal I pay for it and wait for it to be made.

Get it and pull away when we notice the buster bar is missing as well!! So we go back thru and he seemed kind of irritated that HE had messed up my order twice now. Got my buster bar and before we even left the parking lot half my stuff was melted due to two screws ups and having to wait!! 

My main concern is with 3 people working and no one I front or behind me, why were they not more on top of this? Wasn't a complicated custom order either.

There's a ton of TVs inside and outside in the patio. A lot of tables to squeeze a bunch of sports fans and bar goers. 

I've only ordered appetizers and beer when watching sports. The wings and zingers are pretty tasty. The wings were a good size, hot and crispy. The loaded fries and nachos good too. It's pretty much you expect for bar food. The menu overall has a nice selection to fill everyone's desire. The beer menu changes often so feel free to try a new brew. 

During cold season there are heaters in the patio. A nice touch since we've only sat there the times we've been going. Some of my buddies like to smoke cigar so it's always to the patio we go. No smoking inside, but people come out to the patio to smoke. So think twice of where you want to sit. Patio also has a couple couches and fire pits if you wanna lounge. As usual with most bars/restaurants like this, it does get packed and loud during major sporting events.

Service has been good every time I've been here. Friendly and attentive. Especially to a our big group. We'll be back for another sports outting.",2014-02-06 08:10:46

The quality of the burger seemed fine, although for $10, fine doesn't seem to be enough. The regular French Fries were nice and crisp. The taste of the Burger doesn't come close to The Grind which I rate to be #1, followed closely by Deluxe. There wasn't that beefy goodness and charbroiled taste to this burger

I wanted to like this expensive burger as the location is terrific and the service, even on a slow afternoon, was quite wonderful. Unfortunately, it neither lived up to expectations or to its competitiors.

I set a goal for myself a few weeks ago and decided that when I achieved it, I'd treat myself to a mani and pedi. I mentioned this to my friend and she was telling me how she loves the South Blvd location of Polished. So I achieved my goal (go me!) and decided to treat myself at the business my friend recommended to me. 

I made an appt the day before. Easy enough. I came in and was greeted right away and told to pick out my polish. I was somewhat underwhelmed by the selection of colors. A lot of them were just multiple bottles of the same color and there wasn't too much variety. I was immediately seated in this throne type chair that was pretty cool. I didn't wait at all but I can't say if that was because I had an appt or because there wasn't a wait at that time. Kristy was waiting for me at the throne chair and ready to start on the pedicure. She offered me a drink and I went with my favorite, a mimosa (which was huge and very good). The pedicure was pretty good. I had recently hurt one toe pretty bad and she was careful with it, which I appreciated. The massage was kinda brief but relaxing nonetheless. 

Pleased with my pedicure, I moved to a different location for the manicure. The manicure is what keeps this place from getting 5 stars from me. I paid for my service before the manicure. I was disappointed that you can't add your tip to your card so I opted for the ATM located in the store. My service was $40 and I tipped 15%. I don't know if it was the fact that the place was becoming full of customers or that the employee wasn't pleased with my tip but she immediately seemed rushed. To be fair, she did refill my mimosa (holla!) but there was pretty much no hand/arm massage and she seemed in a hurry to paint my nails. That being said, the final product was good so I ain't mad about it. 

I'm a classic manicure girl. I mainly do my own nails at home but when I do get my nails done, I pretty much stick to basic polish (no gel) and maaaaaaaaaybe an accent color (livin la vida loca, y'all). Kristy told me that they don't do designs here because ""customers don't really ask for them"". Like I said, I'm okay with that because I don't really do designs but if you want designs, this may not be the place for you. 

I would definitely come back here but I would:
1. Bring my own cash (the ATM fee is minimal but still...)
2. Bring my own polish because their selection isn't wonderful (in my opinion)",2016-05-07 15:31:05

Anyhow, I fell in love with the Dilly Pickle Popcorn- Snookie would be jealous of our relationship!!!
Even if you don't like pickles I think you should give it a try. I appreciate that there are samples galore here. There are samples on the counter tops (too high for kids and short people though), on a table as you walk in and they let you try anything you want in a good sized little cup. The only popcorn not available to try when I was there was Miss Piggy (Chocolate popcorn with bacon) because it wasn't ready.
I like the Dirty Vegas option which is all their popcorn mixed in a bag for you. So, yes that's savory,spicy and sweet all mixed up- Pretty yummy and cool if you ask me!!!
I purchased a large bag of Dilly Pickle and Dirty Vegas and I'm happy with my purchase.
I thought Smores,Candy Apple and Marilyn Monroe were yummy too. Marilyn Monroe is supposed to be coconut flavored but my daughter tried that and it was good even though I don't like coconut flavored anything. The Candy Apple was neat because there were pieces of dried green apples in the mix. 
I really like the Tutti Fruity Mix that all popcorn places sell but the guy at the counter said that there were too many yucky unhealthy crap (perservatives and additives)  that go into the Multi color-Multi fruit flavored Tutti Fruity mix. So unless he finds a more healthier way to make it, he won't be making it. I appreciated his wanting to keep all the popcorn mixes as yummy but as healthy as possible.

I personally like my popcorn as light as possible, I'm not one to like popcorn covered in globs of caramel or chocolate but I do love fruity stuff. So I was inquiring about that and the guy (maybe one of the managers or owners) said that you need a substance like caramel or chocolate to help the dried fruit stick to the popcorn - Yeah, that makes sense....
Anyhow, the store is clean, the employees are nice and helpful, and the popcorn is tasty- Oh, and I can't forget - it's so close to home.
 
The only thing I didn't like was that the countertops were so darn high, right when I walked in here I noticed all the tall counter tops to cover up whatever the employees were doing. Guess, the don't want us to see them mix the popcorn....",2011-08-26 05:35:23

   Mac N Cheese Muffins - what else can you say..these are top notch and filling.
Brisket Sliders - great brisket, no fat and soft rolls with a tasty unknown BBQ sauce
Shepherd's Pie in a jar - another winner. The potatoes were so creamy (and colorful) and each bite was pretty wonderful with the slightly greasy meat and other ingredients just coming together in a good fashion.

However, something that hasn't happened before but happens now is their dress code expectations and their charge for men at the door. It is ridiculous. I came here on a Friday night and they charged the guys in my group $20 at the front door and turned away a friend of mine because of his attire. He was wearing jeans with dress shoes and a regular shirt with a dressy business jacket. They said it was because he had a shirt on? But that wasn't an issue when my friends and I used to come in the past weekends. This place is on and off, they'll enforce rules but at the same time let some rules slide depending on your appearance at the moment. I just came in last week with a group of friends and a guy came in with a fake ID but still ended up getting in. There's three lines to stand in: guys, girls, and reserved. They have line separators to divide the three lines but there are so much people cutting and passing through the security with ease to get in. Securities let them! Idk if it's because they know them or are friends with them but that's unfair, you got a line of people waiting and depending on how a girl looks or if a guy could slide in money to the security you could get in Gold Spike without waiting. Now that they charge at the door their drinks are pricey (expected, of course!) but my guy friends would buy two cups of drinks that'll already be $14... so $14 for two drinks + $20 at the door for men = $34 total, only one hour into arriving at Gold Spike. Totally not worth it. Also, parking is non-existent, you must be willing to walk far away to get free/ affordable parking or you must pay a lot to find a parking up close.

My husband ordered a Caesar salad. The salad was meh. There were tons of to-go salads in the display case and my husband figured that's what they were - to-go salads. Since we were sitting down and eating he thought they would make the salad fresh and bring it out on a plate. Nope. The employee grabbed a box and handed it to my husband. There wasn't a lot of salad in the large box and the crotons were soggy from being inside the box.

I had heard about this place before and while I was window shopping at the mall I came across Teavana. When I lived in Germany I used to drink this tea that was some sort of a vanilla flavored green tea but I couldn't find it here anywhere. So, when I found this store, I got really excited and walked up to the counter to ask about it. The lady behind the counter told me they didn't have vanilla flavored green tea, which made me a little sad. Then she told me that I could buy green tea and honeyboosh tea, well then I was happy again, even though she seemed really confused about me asking her to mix those teas for me. 

Then I asked what the prices were for the green tea and the honeyboosh, but she didn't tell me, instead she tried to talk me into buying the tin. Well, I told her that I just needed some tea and that I wasn't interested in the tin. So she scoops a little bit of the green tea in the little bag on the scale and tells me that we are at $28 and my jaw almost dropped. I asked if they had a cheaper green tea, but they didn't. At that point I was very disappointed and sad again. I don't know, maybe I'm a cheap a** but paying about $40 for only 4 oz of tea, no matter how good, just doesn't mix well with what I'm making right now. And believe me, I have traveled a lot and have had many good teas.

However their food was great. Price was average. We ordered a wakame salad, takoyaki, fresh tofu, beef and seafood hotpot, Toronto roll, and steamed pork belly with vegetables. 

Takoyaki, my all time favorite food, was a bit on the smaller side here. It was a bit too crunchy on the outside, and dark. However, it still tasted good.. So I'll let the color slide. 

Toronto roll had a BIT too much cream cheese. I love cream cheese but my friends dont. Even I would admit there was a bit too much and it overpowered the rest of the sushi. I still liked it though :)

The hotpot was good. For a two person portion it had a lot of things! Beef was pre seasoned so even without the broth, the beef was tender and seasoned to taste. This was probably my favorite dish there.

Steamed pork belly with vegetables. This was a DIY wrap-like item. They were very generous with the amounts of pork belly given. The vegetables and sauces that came with it were also very good. 

Overall, portions were generous and I would definitely come back.. We had a table of five and for JUST under 20$ after tax and tips, we were all very full. Just need to know what to order maybe. Great place, great food.. Service.. I've heard they always have different servers.",2015-05-13 13:21:54

When I'm craving the good stuff and am willing to sacrifice innocent animals for the purpose, I go for the goat biryani. Guessing by how frequently the place is packed with people, these dishes are perfectly representative. I also recommend the hummus appetizer if you're looking for some tasty to go with your numnum.

The big warning to take in if you go to this place is that if you aren't a leftovers person or won't be able to pack leftovers, you should really plan on sharing a meal. I tend to go here and eat until it hurts and still have enough for lunch the next day. I like to go and split an appetizer and plate with a friend, and I always leave more than full.

We sat right by the window's which were open to let a cool breeze in...but if you love booths, this restaurant sure has them.

This place is not bad but not as good as the hype it has been getting from some reviewers. The portions are a bit small and you do not get as much value for your money, if you ask me. It is authentic in preparation and taste. The problem I have with Japanese food is that the more you eat it. The more it tastes the same. The lunch specials they have is not really a good deal.

mZPDFrXaGA70r58xRKpGuw,_rhYsgWA03_D88d3xEGFvw,p5xDihlQc2geUQGjO7hyIw,4,4,1,4,"Grand opening is today, May 14, 2017!  Free gift to the first 100 people.  I came here around 7:15 AM and had no issues getting my gift.  The place is actually really small, but the layout is actually genius because it snakes around to the door on the other side, making for an in and out experience.

The sandwiches here are small and way pricier than California, I guess I've been lucky with the huge sandwiches there, but I get it, this is Arizona, so they have to account for transportation of goods etc.

Grand opening featured a dragon dance, ribbon cutting, and freebies such as buy a sandwich and receive a baguette or iced coffee for free. 

Lots of choices to choose from, like I said, the portions here are a lot smaller, so don't come expecting huge portions.  There's also a drive thru as well which is very convenient. 

Overall, there are possibly 6 tables and it's very small.  Prices are much higher, but the taste and quality is the same.  Finally, it's open!  Expect long lines and slow service as they work out the kinks, welcome to this side of town, Lee's.",2017-05-14 16:26:47
cSM1OOB0ji6_WsEkwQkejA,U5YQX_vMl_xQy8EQDqlNQQ,sYGRkA52n-2sI2rkDJfMqA,3,8,2,5,"Tip:  FREE admission on Wednesdays after 4pm.  However, parking still remains a flat-fee of $10.  Underground parking is more pleasant, especially on a not-so-warm day.  Direct access to museum from underground.

I'll freely admit that there's only so much ancient pottery, rugs, pieces of the Quran that I can handle, but I came more for the architecture which is, without any question, gorgeous!  I think it is better to go on a beautiful, sunny day when you can actually enjoy the grounds outside and trees will be green.  Infinity pools weren't up and running.

(Again, that might just be a personal preference, but it was difficult to enjoy the paved, outdoor space in overcast, windy conditions.  I reckon that the worst time to visit would be Winter, especially in this part of the city which is full of sharp turns and up/downhill driving.)

I found it a bit difficult to figure out where to start in the museum.  There were quite a few guards/volunteers standing in front of closed doors with frosted glass.  We had to ask people at the ticket booth as to where the start point was.

Main room on ground floor was more ""open concept"" with no real flow.  You just sort of meander and look at random items (bowls, pieces of scripture written in Arabic, incense holders, a carved door, fountain), some behind glass, some displayed out in the open.  I *think* it was ordered by country/chronologically.  However, since there's no straight-forward path, it's quite possible to see things out of order.

As per the other reviewers, there was a lack of description or real significance behind the artifacts...other than, ""Oh, that's old!""  I saw a handful of paintings and about a dozen or so hand-drawn artwork, the rest were random old items.

To access the second floor, you have to get your ticket scanned again, and go up in an elevator.  Seemed like a waste to me as the place isn't that big, I would've preferred going up an set of stairs, perhaps enjoying more of the architecture.

Aside from the lack of description, photos that were on iPads weren't rotated.  The iPads  accompanied old manuscripts/books that were behind glass.  Great idea, but difficult to enjoy when half the photos were sideways.  Why didn't anyone fix this? 

In short:  Beautiful architecture, optimally enjoyed on a nice day, lovely touches inside like the design over the windows, the stools spread throughout, calm, relaxing atmosphere, very fortunate that we live in a city with various cultural museums.  However, there didn't seem to be a flow, difficult to figure out where to go (little signage), some missing details, lotsa closed doors (unnecessary in museums) & there seemed to be some wasted space (huge coat-check area WITH people working it, empty courtyard area, pottery/lounge room) throughout.  

Personally, I wouldn't pay for admission, so I'm glad that I went for free!  :)  Parking should be free in the evenings as well, at least on Wednesday, just sayin'.",2016-03-31 04:11:33

It does get incredibly packed at times. 

A solid neighborhood bar where you can sit at the jukebox and pick the tunes you feel like head bopping to. I always end up putting something on like MGMT or Florence and the Machine, I get weird looks when a soulful jazzy soprano starts belting into the room.

A few points of constructive criticism that I observed: 
-Lost-n-found was a bit of a doozy.  Most volunteers/staff didn't know where it was unless you were nearby and no sign.  People there were super nice though.
-Would've been nicer to have been notified about the app and shuttle info earlier. Although they were answering questions via social, not all the questions were being attended to.  
-More water points would be nice or at least signs pointing you to them.  I only saw two during my exploration.  
-A bigger area for the 'learning' would be better.  Also would be helpful to have sound coming out of the screens showing the presentation for people who couldn't attend.  
-The VIP area was interesting but other than a few nice touches, I don't think it's worth getting over the general admission in it's current form.  I think things like expedited lines, some more swag and discounted merchandise/concessions would go a long way to making it feel more like a VIP experience.  
-Some of the music acts were timed weird like A-Trak & Galantis - both EDM artists that could have played at separate times.  I do get that at a fest, you're not going to see everyone you want to but I think helping to mix up the types of bands playing at the same time.  
-The balloons were kinda cool idea-wise...but man, they popped so easily and I saw so many people get it blown up in their face with glitter all over.  
-I loved a lot of the food and drinks but it was tough numbers-wise to try much.  The Container Park had the best deals ($7 for an awesome hot dog and beer was the best deal I saw) and I'd love to see more deals emulated throughout the rest of the vendors.  
-Not a complaint against the fest but Vegas needs to create a monorail or quick transportation service form the Strip to Downtown and back.  
-Finally, a weird complaint but would really really appreciate wristbands which you can actually loosen.  I initially did mine too tight and had to work at it for a while throughout the day to try and loosen up.  

That...came out longer than I expected.  But even with all of these points, there was a lot to love:  
+Loved the music line-up personally.  Even though the smaller stuff other than the headliners were mostly newcomers, they were a strong bunch if you heard any of them.  And the headliners were all terrific and lived up to what I expected (yes...even Kanye with his usual 'talk time'.)  Otherwise, there was a great variety from EDM (finally got to see Galantis and I was a happy camper) to Milky Chance to Vintage Trouble.  Even getting closer or out of the crowds weren't too bad as people were for the most part really nice and chill.  And the chefs were cool! Cat Cora for instance was nice enough to shake hands and take pics after her session. (Would love to have more samples though!)
+Speaking of nice people, the staff was super nice and the festival in itself was so positive.  Loved all the crazy art wherever you looked (my favorite is still the water slides on the rooftop) and the fact that you were really encouraged to take pictures (the photo scavenger hunt was terrific).  
+LiB allows you to explore Downtown which a lot of tourists forget about.  I've never been myself and it was fantastic to really see a different side of Vegas with a lot of personality and a lot of potential growth.  
+Enjoyed the shuttle system which was usually pretty easy to use, especially getting back.  Problems included traffic, distance and bad drivers which aren't the fault of the festival.  I stayed around the strip and it was easy to get to the Linq and find the shuttle.  
+The festival was quick to adapt...or at least it seemed like it.  Things that weren't apparent on the first day like signs for shuttles or signs for where the speakers were quickly were put up by the end of the first day or at the beginning of the second.  
+The food variety was pretty good although the quality/price was a little hit-or-miss (addressed above).  However, when it was good and especially in a great deal, I can't complain too much.  The best items I had were the pig wrap at Hearthstone and the crazy chef hot dog at the container park.

All-in-all, a terrific experience that I hope keeps on growing.",2014-10-28 01:20:43

The original's from LA,

Right off the strip.

And worth the trip.

The lines are long,

Is it the Slut or sandwiches?
Just take your pick.

The Slut is coddled egg,
On a potato puree.

It's scrambled with cheese.
The burger is awesome,
Make it a double, please.

We got there on a Thursday afternoon after the lunch rush. The server seemed very excited to have people who were ready to dine and drink wine. I can only imagine he was use to people rushing to get back to work. 

We had such a great experience and the food was amazing. We were there for several hours and just didn't want to leave. The ambiance was beautiful and we were able to enjoy the shaded patio.

-They didn't stop cheaters
-They didn't have categories for the subjects of the questions asked 
-They weren't organized so it took longer than it should have to get through all the questions

Issues I had with the service:
-The waitress got mixed up a lot. Didn't know which drinks went to whom and incorrectly billed some of my friends.
-Slow even though the place wasn't that packed when we started ordering.

We like to buy the apples, sweet potatoes (huge bag, usually on sale), ginger (fresher than Chinese supermarkets), Korean cold noodles + soup (from frozen aisle), lettuce (for kimchi) and so on. The items are usually really fresh, some can be quite pricey so it depends on what you buy here. They have a lot of things not limited to food such as kitchenware, slippers, hair dye, skincare, etc. 

On to the food section, there is a a food court area and bakery inside. They sometimes have the pork bone soup as their daily special for a good deal. The pork bone soup here is good. The meat is very tender! Although it tends to be on the saltier end. You order the food and receive an electronic device that beeps when your food is ready and you go pick it up. They also have prepackaged meals like kimbap, sushi, bentos, and such. Or they have self-serve dishes that they charge by weight. There is also a fried chicken area specifically for ordering Korean fried chicken. I usually get the bibimbap, you can choose between the hot stone or regular (basically cold but you get a bowl of warm rice). Hot stone is like a two difference or something. They recently changed up the side dishes so that it is self-serve, you have the kimchi radish and bean sprouts. 

Now for the bakery, I am a huge fan of cream. They sell different types of cream bread here so yes I am in heaven haha. I am a matcha fan so I like the matcha one, particularly the one with a layer of cake in it. It is a bit more on the pricey end depending on what type you get but it is a nice treat. They also sell cakes and bingsoo which I haven't tried. And lastly near the checkout of galleria, there is an area that sells taiyaki. I've tried it before and it is so good when freshly made ahh. Buttery goodness haha. Oh and they sell walnut cakes here (cake shaped like a walnut with walnut and red bean filling, pretty good).

Overall I love Korean food and the culture so I come back pretty frequently. In general the quality has been quite consistent. I highly recommend coming here. They have like a 10% discount for workers on Wednesdays which is good if you work nearby. They have a such a huge variety of meals to choose from after all.

Extra information:
*Specialize in Crepes
*Most of the pastry is made in-house
*Savory and Sweet Crepes
*Wifi for customers 

I decided to check out Cafe by Crepe it Up for coffee and dessert after my delicious lunch at Ginger (which is my ultimate spot for bowl of pho!). Cafe by Crepe it Up is a nice little coffee place on Church Street with big windows and bright lighting.

They sell lots of different items for such a small coffee shop varying from sweet & savory crepes, sandwiches, pastries, cookies, pie, hot beverages and coffee beans. It's always nice to see so much variety at coffee shops because sometimes you just crave something different and new. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice and house-made sandwiches that can be grilled for you if you wish. You can purchase Fair Trade Organic Coffee beans at Cafe by Crepe it Up for around $16.50/lb

Ordered: DARK ANGEL 5/5
*Hazelnut Chocolate Crepe wrapped around Vanilla Ice Cream Ball for $4.95
*As soon as you order at the front, they told me there would be 7 minute wait
*They make the crepe on the spot right after you put in the order
*Such a steal for what you get, the crepe is huge and it's only five dollars
*Crepe is thin and chewy, just like it's suppose to be (not doughy, like the one at Wandas)
*Ends are crispy with lots of rich hazelnut chocolate filling inside
*This was like heaven in my mouth, I could literally see angels flying around
*Only downside is that the icecream melts super fast cause it's wrapped in hot, fresh crepe
*It could get pretty messy to eat
*Perfect for Dessert (might be too much for 1 person, but you really don't want to share this)

Ordered: MOCHACCINO 3/5
*Huge mug of Americano with hint of chocolate for $4.25
*This is perfect for a cold day
*It wasn't too sweet but it had hint of chocolate aftertaste which I loved
*This was perfect with my Dark Angel crepe and complimented the chocolate filling very well
*If I had to compare it, it was kind of like watered down hot chocolate with bitter coffee taste

There were lots of students having lunch here, ordering their savory crepes which I can't wait to try next time I am there. The only down side is that they only have 1 person making the crepe so if the place is busy, your crepes will take long but it's def worth the wait. Also, their specials change everyday and they seeemed to have lots of regulars picking up coffee or sweet pastries from the shop.

Summary: I've been back to Cafe by Crepe it Up couple times after my first visit but had same thing ever single time I was there. Normally, I go for Savory crepes but Dark Angel is really that good. If you are ever on Church street, Cafe by Crepe is Up is def worth the visit.",2011-11-30 14:25:03

Patatas Bravas: Potato wedges that have somehow been infused with the pure essence of bacon. Likely fried with bacon fat, which gives it a unique flavor you won't find anywhere else. Served with an incredible tomato-based sauce that would make Mr. Heinz cry himself to sleep with feelings of inferiority.

Baked Goat Cheese: A classic that has been thoroughly Americanized, with great results. You get a big pile of soft, melty goat cheese in the middle of a plate of sweet and simple tomato sauce. Comes with light and fluffy garlic bread for dipping, making the whole thing a kind of ""deconstructed pizza"" with very high-quality ingredients.

Gazpacho/Cream of Tomato: Both are frequently offered as the soup of the day, and both are unbelievably good. As you're probably starting to notice, The Icon is really good with tomatoes. 

Steak/Lamb: The chef is a master at cooking red meat. Every time I order a dish like this, I get a juicy piece of meat that you can cut like butter. When you slice it open you will tear up and swear you have witnessed a new color - that unmistakable red/pink sear of perfection. The steak comes sitting on a bed of potatoes mashed to a consistency where it's almost a puree, but with little lumps of soft, melt-in-your-mouth chunks.

And anything with Manchego Cheese, such as the above mashed potatoes. I can only describe it as butter-flavored cheese. It transcends the boundaries between dairy products and adds this indescribable texture and flavor to everything it touches.


And some dishes to watch out for...

Tres Zetas: This soup is extremely bitter, flavored with nothing but a variety of mushrooms (and that includes the black broth the mushrooms came soaked in). Thus, my Russian girlfriend loved it. But for someone like me, who didn't grow up eating every kind of mushroom in the country, my palette just isn't prepared for it. It's an adventurous choice, and that comes with an inherent risk.

Spanish Tortilla: Tried this a couple times and it's hit-or-miss. It's a bunch of vegetables pressed together in a ""quiche,"" served with flatbread and an aioli that never fail to impress. But the quiche-thing itself seems to take some skill to make right. I got this overcooked once and it tasted like paper.",2010-11-27 10:59:25

Every dinner selection that I've ordered comes with a rose carved turnip and some selections, like the phenomenal sushi, comes with an edible flower.

I also enjoy their fresh spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce, although some less adventurous customers may be turned off by the transparency of the fresh roll's exterior. The Thai bubble tea was wonderful- very refreshing. No matter what sushi you order, it is wonderful and the presentation is outstanding. I ordered the Chicken Curry dish, which was very good! The ambiance of the place is nice with asian art and plants, an exotic fish tank and is dimly lit. The restaurant is not very big and has many tables, so on a busy night, one may feel slightly cramped or overwhelmed by the patrons voices carrying in the smaller room, but overall it is not too distracting.

There is no trace of the old Fitzgeralds (except for the parking garage, which is the only reminder of that shithole).  

The rooms are updated, comfortable, and reasonably priced.  The casino is fun, upbeat, and entertaining (referring to the dancing girls, obviously).

Kinjo was one of my go to sushi places, usually the one by Chinook, but if it just the hubs and I, we come to this locations. The reason this is complicated is, the server was wonderful and honest, but I'm disappointed in the fakeness. 

Being a celiac, eating is difficult. Sushi was always good, it's fish and rice. So I thought. I quickly found out that I need my own GF soy sauce, which is fine I have purchased it, as well, a lot of sushi places carry it now. After mentioning this the server questioned our whole order and what was mine, as a lot of their stuff isn't authentic and does contain gluten. 

I am not even able to have their salad, which is supposed to be a house made dressing. Their miso actually has gluten too. IMO Kinjo is like McDonald's of sushi. It's a fast food sushi, that doesn't have good quality, they want you in, and out.

HOWEVER.  I absolutely didn't see the hype in this place.  The chicken fingers were soft/tender which I love, but NO flavor.  Definitely lack of seasoning!  and SMALL!!!  So due to the size, they are OVER PRICED!  I did like the sauce but all in all who cares about the sauce if the main item isn't worth the price and lacks flavor.

I definitely have to say that the chicken fingers at Carl's Jr (although they are a bit pricey too) are the best around!

C1xKX_UQ1a4KVndMZwKySw,YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,uBBiD1XJk697Qcr84MIbKA,4,12,0,1,"WNW is officially open for the season as of March 28, 2015. The weekend prior, they hosted a video game and comic event where the 1st 100 people in line, in costume, got a free silver season pass. Which now means I will be here a lot as I scored one of those free season passes. As it's on the other side of town from me, I can't say I would've come here otherwise.

We went on the Sunday following opening day. I was expecting a massive crowd, given that it was Spring Break, it had just opened, and the high was in the 90s. But it was actually relatively quiet. Hooray! We easily parked and easily entered. (They will search your bag. And don't forget to bring your own towel.) 

We then proceeded to the locker area and dropped $8 on a small locker rental. You pay with a credit card at a self-serve machine. You then get wristbands with a bar code. You scan that barcode at a set of lockers and your assigned locker opens. You can access your locker as many times as needed throughout the day. I would strongly advice getting a locker and putting everything in it.

The park is rather small and is comprised mostly of concrete. I wish it had more landscaping and prettiness. I didn't experience any issues with bees or other insects. There are lounge chairs and tables spread all around. Lots of seating areas.

Not everything was open when we were there. Only one slide in the kiddie area was open. One regular slide was closed. And they were alternating between the lazy river and wave pool. But I guess that was due to crowd size and staff size. No biggie. Bonus: The tubes are free (no rental required) for the lazy river.

We started with the kiddie area so I could get warmed up to the idea of water slides (it'd been like 20 years since I'd been on one). We got drenched in water and went down a kiddie slide. It was fun! And the water was surprisingly warm.

We then proceeded to the bigger slides. At each slide, you have to wait in line to get a raft / tube at the bottom of the slide. You then proceed up the stairs with your raft / tube to the top of the ride. Note: The grabbing of rafts / tubes at the bottom is not policed and small children will cut in front of everyone.

When there are multiple slides up one set of stairs, there is a lack of directions. Which means the lines will get confusing and you will get cut in front of multiple times over. This is not a place to go if you are short on patience. Note: Parents do just let their kids run all over unsupervised. But it's not too too bad when it's not crazy crowded.

There are some rides with weight requirements. Lots of kids don't meet these on their own. The half pipe one is a prime example. You will then be motioned to and muttered at about splitting into different groups and riding with strangers. Even though they might be cute, small children, you should refuse this. I lost my turn in line this way when the other kid backed out and decided he didn't want to ride with me (my BF had already gone down with our raft and a small girl). So I was left with no raft and no ride. And I had to go back down the stairs, wait in a long line all over again to get a raft. And then wait in line all over again to get to the top of the ride. Lame. Lesson learned: Don't be nice.

The staff are seriously less than desirable. It's teens, they're in the sun all day, and they have to deal with little kids. And they're probably working for minimum wage. So I can't really blame them. But I encountered exactly one good staffer. Female at the top of the 3 slide ride (can't remember the name - green, blue, or orange slides). She was great. You knew what was going on, things were orderly, and things were safe. Every other ride, not so much.

On shoes: Water shoes are probably advisable. The concrete wasn't hot when we went, so we were fine in flip flops.And we just left them at the bottom of each ride and had no issues retrieving them. And it seems lots of people were doing this. I also saw some people holding their flip flops as they went down the rides. Personally, I was little too terrified (but having fun!) to not hold on to the handles the entire time.

The rides are all fun and not as scary as they might seem. I think the Royal Flush was my favorite. But all were good. And fun! And yeah, I think I screamed more than the little kids.

In sum, I had a total blast. We went on every ride we could and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. And that's as 30-something adults.

I actually went to the bar and ordered a drink before my drink got to the table. They took a long time turning on the heaters and a girl from my group moved them herself.

As an example, the small morsels of lamb in your curries should not take 32 chews to be able to swallow.  Yes, I counted last order, because, well, I can be bitchy and yet I also like to substantiate my reviews with evidence.  You are either attempting to dress mutton up as lamb or you are rushing the cooking process.   Pretty sure it is both and regardless, neither is acceptable. 

Further, are you using liquid smoke in your tandoori meats to give the illusion of being properly tandooried?  Whatever you are doing, it is terrible and synthetic tasting 

Last, you have changed your naans and yet you are trying to pass them off as authentic naan and are trying to tell me they are the same as always. I have never experienced authentic naan served in a perfect round circle reminiscent of a sandwich wrap, even more remarkable that we have ordered 12 naans over the last 4 orders and they are all exactly the same size and shape -magical.  How do you do it

Not to overstate the obvious, but we will not ever be ordering from you again unless you fix your kitchen and revert to your previous honestly and standards.

I read a lot actually, but I'm not very good at it. I'm a slooooow reader, and it takes me a lot of time to get through reading material. I tend to get bored or my mind starts drifting, and I begin thinking of other random things. It can be a bit frustrating when I keep getting side tracked, and have to read the same page 35 times. 

So that said, it's not reading that I like, it's knowledge, and thus, I love book stores. The smell, the vast amounts of information they hold, the general quiet environment. 

When I saw Half Priced Books Records and Magazines I felt compelled to stop in and check it out. It's a big store with many things to offer.

I'm moving to Phoenix soon so I stocked up on a bunch of AZ, Southwest US and Phoenix travel books. Could I get most of that info on the internet for free? Yeah probably, but I tend to collect books even if I never read them. I think it may be a sickness... 

I didn't wander the store long since I pretty much knew what I was looking for, but from what I did see, they have a good variety of books. I also glimpsed a Culture Club vinyl record for $3.99. I don't even own a record player. However, having a story where I tell people that I own a Culture Club LP seemed to have great allure. I somehow resisted the urge to buy it. Perhaps another day.

I enjoyed my stint at HPBR&M and will certainly go back. If I could make one recommendation it would be this; do some research on the prices of the books you're buying. Some of the books I found were a little older and probably a bit outdated so I passed on them. Although, the prices may be half off the publishers recommended price, you may actually get a better deal online for some books. 

I don't like choosing online companies over a brick and mortar store for many reasons, but when I was shopping, that thought crossed my mind a few times and so I feel the need to pass it on. 

All in all though, this place is definitely worth visiting.",2013-08-05 17:01:53

If Ruth's Chris had a rewards program, my family would have free steak for life.  That being said, I know what is expected here.  It's going to be stuffy and overpriced; you know that.  But your expectation is the food and service should make up for those little trips.

+1 and I are early 20s, cute lil' professional guys.  I understand we are a contrast to the older people in floor length furs, but we didn't come in off the street like a bunch of ruffians demanding cheese fries (although the ladies behind the host podium would have disagreed).  After being greeted with ""do you have a reservation"", we let them know we were early and would have a drink at the bar until our scheduled time was up.  Drinks were fine. Whatever.

We were taken to our table which was one of two placed right in front of the kitchen and that terrifying eagle.  They're kind of like the next to the bathroom booths.  When I asked our hostess if we could move to one of the few (3+) open tables that were actually in the dining room, she said she couldn't do that (I would normally freak out over this, but somehow that pales to the rest of the night).  Our waiters and helpers/runners were awesome.  They weren't nearly as personable as you'd expect, but they didn't act like we were confused and didn't mean to be there.

Now here, judging by the other reviews, I should rave about the food.  That is absolutely not going to happen.  This is also going to be much more harsh than it should be as I was expecting (what I suppose is) way too much.  Way harsh, T. Oops.

Because I don't do seafood, we ordered the fries ""to share"" .. The portion you receive of the truffle fries is sad.  If Burgatory's truffle fries are a 10, these may get a 4.  We both ordered our double priced Caesar salads and were given small plates of yellow iceberg.  I can't tell you how sad this was.  A few shavings of asiago I was able to find saved my sanity that night. For our main courses, I ordered the chicken that makes more an hour than I do, and +1 got the strip steak.  He said it was ""good,"" but was not impressed in the slightest.  My chicken tasted like I did nothing but threw a chicken in the oven and then cut it in half and served it to you with some blackened cooked shriveling yellow carrots.  It was sad.  So sad we didn't even get dessert.  I just wanted to get out of there.  The only decent sustenance I received was 200% marked up glass of Riesling.

If you are thinking of going here, it won't be the worst.  Clearly, people enjoy it.  But if you are one of those people that may have expectations for anything ever or don't happen to have some extra change from your hedge fund to waste, keep walking until you hit Ruth's Chris or something that isn't going to make you cry into your fifty dollar piece of meat (at least that would season it).",2015-02-16 21:09:25

This place has the best bibimbap in the city if you ask me. Fresh ingredients, and many options for bibimbap.

Depending on where you sit flagging down a server can be difficult. I don't really mind. If being pampered by a nice server is critical for your dining experience, I would say don't visit an Asian place to begin with.

CRAB SOUP ( picture): the crab soup was mainly broth with very little crab meat, however, the broth tasted like a base to a crab chowder... I would have liked it more if I could get more/ bigger chunks of crab.  Very delicious otherwise!

POPPER DIP ( picture): this appetizer was the reverse to the jalapeño poppers.  You received a cheese dip with bits of jalapeño throughout. The cheese was just the right heat to it. It had a combination of cheeses that made it yummier than your average cheese and jalapeño dip.  It was served with pretzel bits and green peppers for dipping.

I told her what I was looking for and she performed a skin analyses to find out my perfect make-up shade.  Then she showed me products that carry my shade.  Next we discussed which ones would be best for me.

Next she proceeded to apply the two foundations that I wanted to try on my face.  I told her it still made my skin look dry.  She proceeded to ask me a lot of questions about my skincare.  I told her everything and she informed me that the clinique moisturizer (the yellow one) really isn't a moisturizer.  She told me what to exchange my brand new moisturizer for and then addressed my issue with my dry skin.

She performed a three step cleansing process and showed me these great pads to use that exfoliate your skin.  After cleansing and exfoliating process, she explained why I should be using a make-up primer.  We used the primer on my skin before the foundation and it made a huge difference.  My skin looked smooth and gorgeous again.

I bought both the primer and the exfoliator.  As soon as my current face wash runs out I will try the one she used on my face.

I am so grateful that she spent over an hour with me.  She taught me a lot about my skin and how to take care of it.  She also showed me how to quickly fill in my eye-brows.  Before it would take me 10 minutes to do.

I had an appointment on Friday, July 7, at 8:30am. The airbag was to be replaced. I asked them to also look at my air conditioner because it worked great until it got up over 105 degrees, then it didn't blow very cold. I also asked that the breaks be checked because I heard squeaking. Javier said my brake fluid and coolant needed to be flushed and refilled. I said OK. It was agreed that he would contact me with an estimate before any work was done. 

I was contacted a little after 11:00am. I was told how much the brake fluid flush and radiator flush would cost. I was also told that I needed to repair the air conditioner, get a new power steering pump, pay for a power steering flush, and replace the transmission fluid. I was told that the air conditioner was completely out of Freon, that it was empty. This made me immediately suspicious of all of the claimed repairs. I wondered how my air conditioner could be working so well (except in very high temperatures) if there was zero Freon in the car when I dropped it off. I didn't think that was possible and wanted to check it out.

 At that time, I said only replace the air bag and fix the brakes, since I was concerned about driving with bad brakes. I was told that they had already drained my brake fluid and the radiator fluid, so I had to pay for those things. Rather than argue, I just said OK. I wasn't sure if they were lying about the Freon or not, so I just said I would wait for the other things until I got another estimate. I didn't want to make an accusation when I didn't know enough about cars to know if that was possible. While driving home, I noticed my air conditioning no longer even blew cool air which made me think that someone there had drained all of the Freon out of the car in an attempt to get me to pay a higher bill. I later saw on their own paper work that the mechanic stated he had evacuated the Freon from my car.

When I got home I went on several websites where people can ask about car repairs. I told what happened and asked if it was possible for my air conditioning to work well except with temperatures over 105 degrees and the car be totally out of Freon. I explained everything that happened. The people on the sites told me that it was impossible to have been working well if the car was out of Freon. I was told never to go back there because they had emptied the Freon from the car. I'm very disappointed about what occurred. I also noticed that comments attributed to me were placed on the paper work I was given at the end which I never said. I think my comments were altered to help justify the extra expenses.

It says, ""Customer states brakes are making a grinding noise,"" which isn't what I said. I had said they squeak when I press on them. I think the statement was changed to justify needing to work on the rotors, too, instead of just changing out the brake pads. The other comment was, ""Customer states A/C is blowing cold enough once the car has been running for a while,"" when my actual words were that it works great until the temperature is up over 105 degrees. I asked if that could mean the car needs more Freon.

On Tuesday, July 11, 2017 I went to a friend recommended repair shop to check on the air conditioner and the power steering pump. There was nothing wrong with my air conditioner. The mechanic stated that all of my Freon had been removed from the car which is, of course, what I suspected and later read. He also checked the power steering pump. He stated there was nothing wrong with it. It wasn't leaking. The mechanic replaced the missing Freon, and the car has run great since then.

I emailed the company on 7/9/2017 and 7/11/2017.  A Bryan did call and leave a message which I repeatedly returned. I was always told he was unavailable. On Friday, I was told he wouldn't return until Monday. None of my calls were ever returned.",2017-07-18 18:03:50

We ordered the sashimi platter, the Ichi Roll and the Eel Cucumber roll, and there were no complaints! $13.95 for a good sized platter of sashimi is a hell of a deal. I rarely order sashimi because most places want $15 for 5 or 6 pieces of mediocre fish. For $14 I got 6-8 pieces of 4 different types of fish: yellowtail, salmon, tuna and a marinated fish that tasted almost like Hawaiian poke, but I couldn't tell you what it was. It was damn good though. The fish was fresh and flavourful. 

The Ichi Roll has spicy tuna, crab and seabass, topped with tempura flakes. It was cool, light and refreshing. Perfect for a warm day! 

For the eel and cucumber roll, I actually subbed out the cucumber for avocado, and I'd absolutely recommend the swap! Get it with eel sauce and tempura flakes, for crunch, and it's amazing.

No, I don't mean a place that Jude Law escorts me to a room where Johnny Depp is slicing up pieces of aromatic French Cheese to place gently into my mouth only after Matthew McConaughey has finished drawing my lavender-infused bath.  I do mean, however, the restaurant Utopia on cool College St., where you get any kind of burger - veggie, beef, chicken, or lamb - with any kind of topping and condiment you want.  Utopia also has a reasonably priced and abundant selection of burritos -from beef to tuna -, quesadillas, and salads and they are all delicious.  The restaurant is quite small and even though they have a year round patio in the back there are a lot of burger craving hipsters out there and therefore there is, for the most part, always a wait.

This is the place where I first fell in love with Moscato. I can't say enough about their Moscato except that it is delicious!

Their bruschettas are very tasty and hands down the best I've ever had. They get creative with their toppings and there's something to please palettes of all kinds. If I had to narrow down my top 4 favorites, I would choose: the apple, brie, and honey; fig, marscapone, and pistachio; the mozzarella, basil, and tomato; and finally the prosciutto and fig.

Downside - parking can be tough since this place is usually hopping. But they offer valet at a staggering price of $3. That's right - 3 bucks. Not too bad to have someone park your car 20 feet away.

I made the decision Friday night that I wanted seafood, and Sea Level is my closest place. Made a Yelp reservation for 2 at 7:30, and we parked in the labyrinth of the Hearst Tower deck (which they validate, regardless of event parking!!). Show up, and turns out we didn't need a reservation! The Lady and I were seated in the patio, but most of it touches Hearst Plaza which doesn't have the traffic or construction noises. Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions, and we both started out with a drink. The Lady got the Meow Mule and I ordered the Smokey Old Fashioned, which was perfectly smoked in every sip. 

To start, we got two Oyster Steamed Buns, which have a fried oyster for a good crunch. For our entrees, we knew we wanted fresh, so we splurged a little and got two of the fresh catch entrees; one Triggerfish, and one Snapper. As soon as these came out, we could tell how much work was put into the plates. The Triggerfish was sweet and tasted of crab (because, as our server explained, that's what it feeds off of) and the snapper had crispy skin and flaky flesh, just perfectly cooked. Each were served with it's own side dish, the Trigger wish a creole rice and slaw mixture, and the Snapper with a southern succotash that was stellar. 

The menu changes daily, which means that they always provide the freshest catch. Prices are definitely a nice occasion with entrees hovering around the $30 range (and then you got drinks and apps and yada yada), but if you know that walking in, you're good. Unless you go for the oyster happy hour, then you can get out cheap :)",2017-08-29 17:09:53

We had a custom pizza to share which had sausages, pepperoni, mushrooms and garlic on thin crust. The pizza was greasy probably because of the thick cut pepperonis that were in there. The mushrooms were the highlight of the pizza for me. They were delicious!

346 is all about experimentation! They continually craft fine products due to this exploratory nature. The down side is that they have a small variety of pastries and gelatos that are constantly changing so your favorites might not always be in. The upside is that there are some pretty great options that find their way out of the kitchen! Where else will you try truffle croissants one day and ghost chili croissants the next? 4 star pastries and 5 star gelato!...4 strong stars in general!

On any given day there will be 10 - 12 different gelato/ice cream/sorbet flavors to choose from. If you want a specific gelato or sorbet special orders from their ever-growing catalogue of flavors can be made with a 3 pint minimum...or custom designed flavors can be done with a 3 quart minimum. Many of their flavors can also be duplicated into macaroons. Since their gelato case is rather small this are pretty cool options. Some of my favorite flavors are listed below, but check out their website for a full list of catalogue flavors:
Madagascar Vanilla Bean
Valrhona Guajana 70% 
Szechuan Chocolate 
Roasted White Chocolate 
Espresso Caramel
Toasted Almond
Passion Fruit and Vanilla
Crème Brulee
Pecan Streusel
Mascarpone and Chocolate
Vanilla Honey 
Lychee 

Sorbet:
Lemon and Thyme
Passion Fruit
Yuzu
White and Green Tea Fusion
Honey Cardamom
Grapefruit-Jalapeno


All of the gelato flavors are not technically gelatos. 346 doesn't really adhere to conventional standards for gelato vs. ice cream. They see it as a spectrum and create recipes with texture in mind to get the best outcome possible. Consistently exceptional!
Their pastries aren't quite as strong as their frozen creations in my opinion. They are still quite good, but not as outstanding as the frozen case. The selection is thankfully growing every time we come back, but is still on the small side. Additionally, they don't seem to approach the pastries with the same creative abandonment that they do with their frozen treats. I recently very excited to try a ghost pepper croissant...the flavor was great, but the use of ghost pepper was peculiar...it wasn't very hot at all as ghost pepper items go. You can regularly find cookies, tarts, macaroons and basque cakes (LOVED the pastry cream-filled), but come early for their lovely croissants...in fact come early or call to reserve any specific item you want because the supply is usually on the short side of demand...a good issue for this small, literal, mom & pop place to have!

Additionally they offer several novelty toppings like torched house-made marshmallows and liquid nitrogen frozen mousse. These are cool to experience, and the marshmallows seem to be a hit with marshmallow fans, but I can pass on the frozen mousse. 

Others have said it's a little pricey here. Everything is relative. It may be a little on the high side for Vegas, but it certainly isn't over-priced...and it is a little cheaper than what we face in larger cities with great food scenes.",2015-04-15 19:15:01

Anyways.... went here for a lunch meeting suggestion.  Place was pretty busy, we didn't have to wait to get a table but it looked packed all the way back at lunch time on a friday.  Good deco. Clean. Very busy mill ave vibe. Lots biz lunch meetings going on and yet it remained a good volume in there to have a meeting and hear everything fine still.

Ordered food and got it out on the table fast.... no I mean like FAAAAST!  I didn't time it but it couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes MAX.  Like FAST.  Okay you get it I know.  Service was very friendly as well.

Hard to explain but the food was light... most mexican food you walk out feeling like you have a bowling ball in your gut... Not here... It didn't seem greasy like most places and everything up to the tomatoes were very fresh and crisp.  They used Asadero cheese on top, which is super good, not many places use it anymore.  Not the Gringo cheese you get like at macayos or anything.  The rice was really good and flavorful too.

To view the flip side of this review... I wasn't a big fan of the chips and salsa. Chips seemed semi-fresh but really thick, I like a lighter tortilla.  The salsa was just a red sauce.... tomato sauce with some heat... no chunks...  It seems to go with the ""light"" theme I mentioned earlier but I ended up not eating much of it at all - just wasn't my thing.  I like fresh tomatillos onion etc etc....

If we could do half reviews this would be a 3.5.  I gave them the shove to 4 because Restaurant Mexico is kind of a downtown Tempe staple - they've been around a long time and that's gotta count for something in this town.",2010-08-21 23:24:04

Again, she was fabulous the problem was just the ratio of tables to staff. 

I've eaten here several times and typically love the food, but this past time the tacos were definitely too oily. There was liquid all over the plate which made the tacos soggy and unappetizing.

They use organic bean sprout which is so unique!!

At first bite I can tell the differences with other regular pho taste which is not intense and not deep enough flavour but later I could feel and taste how great it is.

Service was good and kind.

And they have open kitchen.

Also they have one of the most clean and hygenic washroom!!

Disappointing. The Mexican corn which was way over priced and tasted like canned corn and the chipotle mayo they used was terrible... Zero seasoning, no lime, the mayo was overpowering. I'm Black and I can make better Mexican corn. This place is not even close to authentic. Another waitress started waiting on us at this point.

We warned them that the Las Vegas concept of deli is like the Statue of Liberty at New York/New York - all smoke and mirrors and totally fake, but they were brave and hungry.

We got there at about 8:30 pm, early enough for all the food still to be available, but too late for it not to be dried out.

The Pluses: 
-  the homemade potato knish is fabulous, and full of caramelized onions.  And they have deli mustard to accompany it, though at a different counter.

-  the Douwe Egberts coffee machine spits out dark roast coffee, latte, cappuccino, and a few other choices.

-  the cheesecake is fairly good, but wouldn't give Cheesecake Factory any competition.

The Minuses:
-  the corned beef was dry, rubbery, and tasteless

-  the mussels tasted weird, in a spit-it-out kind of way

-  the shrimp, described as ""walnut shrimp"" on the card, had no walnuts, but were sickeningly sweet

-  the pastrami tray, which was half-full, consisted of the tiny bits that fall off the pastrami when you cut it.  There wasn't a single bit that could be called a SLICE.  If I were hankering for a pastrami sandwich, I would have been wearing it instead of eating it.

The other foods that were part of the NY Deli ""experience,"" such as the potato pancakes, gefilte fish, herring in cream sauce, matzo ball soup, and the like, are all things that I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.  But the others pronounced them ""okay,"" but not great.

0PjE4znmMj8eMPGqLw37Zw,BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,RdwHiTJzpCU4Q8pgsJhiKg,4,2,0,0,"I went here recently with my parents.  We had the Lumpiang Shanghai (Spring Rolls) ($7.99), a whole fried chicken ($14.99) and a large Garlic Rice ($3.99).  We wanted the Crab Fried Rice ($9.99), but they said it wasn't available that day (we went on a Tuesday.  Maybe it's only available on the weekends?  I don't know).  We also had a Halo-Halo ($5.99) and a Buko Pandan ($4.99) for dessert.  Yeah, I know, our meal was completely devoid of vegetables, but none of the veggie dishes looked that appetizing.

Anyway, so the Lumpiang Shanghai came in a basket made of fried spring roll wrappers - a neat idea.  The spring rolls are tiny, but you get quite a few of them.  They were delicious and flavourful.  I'm not sure what spices are in them, but they taste different than Chinese spring rolls.  They came with a nice sweet and sour dipping sauce.

The Garlic Rice was 5 large scoops of rice with bits of fried garlic in it.  Very garlicky, but tasty.  The fried chicken was good, but not spectacular.  I have to admit that I was expecting more from a place that is famous for its friend chicken.  It was a bit oily and there is no breading.  I think they just rub it with some spices and fry the entire chicken whole.  The chicken was moist, but not all that flavourful.  Although it tastes really good with the ""Banana Ketchup"" which incidentally doesn't have any tomatoes in it, so it's really a banana sauce (although it's red and looks like ketchup).  

The Buko Pandan was the most delicious part of the meal.  It was chunks of pandan flavoured jello, coconut, and tapioca in a rich cream sauce, topped with a scoop of coconut ice cream and toasted rice flakes.  So rich and creamy and heavenly.  You have to try this if you go to Max's.  

I was actually looking forward to the Halo-Halo most during this visit and while it was good, it was overshadowed by the Buko Pandan.  The Halo-Halo was a typical mix of palm seeds, coco de nata, macapuno strings, red beans, a piece of flan, a scoop of taro ice cream and toasted rice flakes, all on top of shaved ice mixed with coconut milk.  It is very colourful and comes in a big glass with a paper umbrella in it.  It was less sweet than the Buko Pandan, but still good.

The server we had was very friendly and efficient.  He even offered to take a picture of us (with our own camera of course), which I thought was nice of him.  We weren't even taking pictures, he just randomly asked us if we wanted him to take a picture of us.  Some might find this strange, but I thought it was nice.  So I pulled out my phone and he took 2 pictures of us.  

This was my second experience with Filipino food (my first being at the now defunct Manila Hut in Ottawa), and I'm looking forward to trying more of this cuisine.  

I think I want to try the Crispy Pata (deep fried pork hock) next time.  I've heard so much about it, and other people in the restaurant were having it, and I was going to try it but felt intimidated by the size and artery-cloggingness of it all.  

Casual dining atmosphere.  Lots of parking, as it is in a strip mall.  If you've never had Filipino food before, I think this is a great place to start.  There are lots of pictures and descriptions (something that was severely lacking at Manila Hut, which is why I did not have a positive opinion of Filipino food after my first experience.  Had my first experience with Filipino food been at Max's it wouldn't have taken me 7 years to try Filipino food again!).",2013-11-16 23:04:21

So cool in fact, that I suggested Twenty Highland Tavern to some friends of mine when we had a girls night out.  We went on a weeknight and despite an appealing looking menu and atmosphere, the service and food were a big letdown.

At the table, we had a kale salad, the pretzel bites, a couple of sushi rolls, and the Chinese chicken.  We asked for a couple of things not on the menu (ie: low sodium soy sauce and a virgin cocktail for my super pregnant friend), but they couldn't accommodate either request.  I found this disappointing, especially because here we were sitting in a huge Whole Foods Market - you'd think they could run to the appropriate aisle and get what they needed to make their customers happy.  Guess not.

The food (which took forever to arrive) was underwhelming.  My friend had to send back her sushi roll because the way the tuna was cut made it so difficult to chew, it was inedible.

That artificial sweet taste with a hint of lighter fluid after taste. I looked at it and wished I walked the extra few feet to go to fat Tuesday's. Plus, they charge 5 bucks for each extra shot, so my $17 margarita was $27!! And I watched her pour the bicardi into the margarita, it wasn't nearly two shots. The girl didn't even know what rum was.

We ordered an app, lunch, and dessert. For the appetizer we had the toast n jam n cheese. It was small but enough to satisfy 2 people. It tasted great and the sweet onion jam is to die for!

Winestore offers a variety of wines that you may or may not find in grocery stores.  What I like about this concept is that they'll let me try any wine if I'm unsure before I buy it.  Today I bought two wines but I ordered them online.  Walked in and they were sitting there waiting for me.  I recently bought a wine captain (not a fridge...totally different) and I need to fill it with wines that I can save and wine that I can drink.

I had their $3 mimosa which was so heavy on the OJ and not even a nice pour in the wine glass. I also got a bucket of bud light which was $25. $25 for a bucket really?....

Just cleaning.  And the place looked it.  Sparkling clean throughout.  I hope her boss knows how diligent she is about making the place look and smell clean.  Now to the food. 
The way it works is that you go to the counter, order, pay and when it is ready they bring it to you.  We had the small platters which come with one side and pita.  Hubby had the greek chicken with the Greek salad.  I had the chicken souvlaki with french fries.  The greek chicken was chopped up chicken which made it a bit dry.  The Greek salad was good as were the pitas which accompanied each platter.  The chicken souvlaki was more like a shish-kabob, nice and juicy,  so mine was the better of the two dishes.  We also got a small side of yogurt which is traditional to Greek cuisine.  
The young lady was friendly, the place was clean and the pricing was fair.  I would choose the chicken souvlaki over the greek chicken anytime.

Usually, when you get something with sea salt on it, it's just sprinkled on the top but this had the topping PLUS sea salt mixed in. It made for a ridiculously salty cookie, especially after having the heavy, sweet cupcake. It was also on the drier, and smaller, side. Definitely not worth over $2.

Therefore, I dreaded both recent visits to this Sonora Quest Lab location more than you know.  But I did go, twice, and I survived!

Sonora Quest Laboratories seems to dominate the Valley when it comes to blood tests prescribed by doctors.  You are given paperwork that shows what tests you need done and a sheet of paper that has SQL locations all over the Valley.  This one happens to be most convenient to where I live, so this is where I've gone, twice, recently... 

The first time I went was on a weekday afternoon.  I was one of only a couple of people in there and the experience was not as bad as I anticipated because of Ronnie, the lovely lady who took my blood and talked to me throughout the process.  She had a soft touch, got my vein on the first try, and didn't make me feel bad that here I was, a grown adult, looking away from the needle as tears rolled down my face.

The next visit was early this morning, a Friday... I walked in and the place was packed!  You would think they were giving away something for free!  There was barely a seat free in the waiting room.  My jaw dropped when I walked in and the lady working at the front told me not to worry, the wait wouldn't be more than 30 - 40 minutes.  She was right on.  This time around, a woman named Jennifer took my blood.  She found my vein on the first time also... thank goodness!

If you are given paperwork from your doctor that shows you need to get your blood tested, this location will get the job done - and get it done as efficiently and pain-free as possible.  Still, as much as the folks at SQL are friendly and seem to be doing a good job, I hope I don't have to return for a very long time... no offense, Ronnie and Jennifer!",2010-01-09 02:18:43

I opted for Hawaiian (don't judge, it's delicious), but every option looked just as good. And did i mention that it's only $3.75 a slice? Standard, but given the quality, you're getting way more than you paid for.

Olive Garden has become the brunt of many jokes over the years and even had a clever and hilarious skit done on Mad TV years ago. The main complaint I have heard time and time again is that the food is not ""authentic."" No comments about the food being bad or bland, just that its not ""authentic."" Ok I will agree that the food may not be ""authentic"" from my perspective of what Italian food should be. My grandfather was 100% Italian and I ate much of his Italian food growing up. That is what I consider ""authentic"" Italian food to be. Here's the thing though... I have never been to Italy and I am sure that most of the people complaining about OG's authenticity havn't been either. So who are we to know that its not authentic in some area of Italy? I am fairly sure its not and you can bet that when I do visit Italy inside and out (which will hopefully be in the next year), I will be yelping another review on the OG just to say if it is indeed ""authentic.""
One thing I can vouch for with Olive Garden is that most of the items I have tried there are delicious and their bread-sticks are like crack! Sure sure, laugh and knock me as much as you want but I know that everyone that has had OG likes at least one thing. You can slam OG but you have either liked their bread-sticks, soup, salad, or some kind of entree. Anyways, to address the point I am trying to make: a good restaurant (chain or not) should have good food and I can say that Olive Garden does have good food. Their soups are delicious (try the chicken gnocchi or the zuppa Tuscana), the bread-sticks are light, airy and buttery with the right amount of garlic flavor, and although the salad is nothing special vegi wise, the dressing is one of the better Italian dressings out there and is very refreshing. For entrees, they make the one of the best eggplant Parmesans and fettuccine Alfredos I have ever had, the stuffed chicken Marsala is unique but delicious, and their seafood portifino is rich and creamy with a generous amount of perfectly cooked seafood. The desserts are equally as delicious, my favs being the apple crostada and the black tie mousse cake. 
The service has always been decent although you may get an occasional slow waiter. However, I can say that most times I walk away satisfied with the overall experience. The price and value is terrific too. Come on, how many other ""Italian"" places you know of where you can get bread, salad/ soup, and big bowl of pasta for less then 15.00? Not very many, that's for sure!
My only complaints: Too family friendly and sometimes there are screaming kids, however, with a few bowls of  delicious soup and pasta, I can sometimes manage to drown it out. Also, years ago, I ordered nothing but their cannelloni al forno (pasta tubes filled with meat and topped with cheese, Alfredo and marinara sauce). My precious dish was taken away from me and replaced with ""three meat ravioli"" which was close so I kept getting that. Then that was removed from the menu. I started getting ""classics"" after that that I was sure would not be removed from the menu like eggplant parm. But for dessert, I fell in love with their chocolate molten cake with vanilla cream and strawberries. Guess what happened? Yep, it was taken away from me  :(  I have also heard numerous complaints about how a special one month will be terrific but a month later, its no longer available and is never to be seen again. I wish the OG would stop replacing good meal items and also bring back some of the popular past specials so people can enjoy them again. I also wish that one of those specials will be the cannalloni al forno. If that was the case, I would go there for a month straight and order it. OG, stop changing out good menu items.

In this latest dining experience at the Rea Road location, I have to say that it was disappointing from start to finish.  We arrived at the restaurant at 5:30 pm on a Saturday night, and our options were either at the bar or the outside patio (otherwise, a TWO-hour wait!).  This particular location of Firebirds tend to be very popular...and seating has always been a problem.  In any case, we opted for the patio, which turned out to be quite ""rough"".  It was just NOT a pleasant ambiance at all, with awkward placement of tables (too close to the door, in our case)...and we were completely surrounded by loud toddlers and kids from all the adjacent tables.  Then came the menu options.  Both my husband and I have always liked the quality of the foods served here, and the service was fine on the most part, but it seemed to me that their menu options have shrunk since our last visit.  In any case, I opted for one of their salads and soup...and there came my second disappointment.  The soup of my choice, Clam Chowder, was not available.  I was not happy with the  2 choices for their available soups, so I went with one of their sides - mashed potatoes.  While it tasted OK, it was fairly bland, with not much seasoning, barely any toppings nor any gravy.  Basically, THE only thing I enjoyed during this dining experience was their salad (Love their Shrimp & Strawberry Salad).  My husband enjoyed his battered Fish Tacos as well (though somewhat skimpy on the Fries).  Still, we were both disappointed with the overall dining experience.  We both agreed that the Firebirds at South Park was MUCH more accommodating, more pleasant overall...and not as much fanfare getting a table either! Yes, they do serve good (but not great) food here, but I honestly feel that they are highly over-rated, especially in this Rea Road location.

I hate being so harsh, but this place sucked. This place sucked more than having to turn down girl scouts selling cookies because I'd already purchased them. This place sucked more than a Burger King Hot dog. Let's begin with where it all starts. The door. The decor did not match. It's a RuPaul drag race situation, a bit confused and the carpet not matching the drapes kinda situation. The Chips, well I don't know how but they were dry,....does that make sense. I think I prefer a greasier chip. These were like crispy oven baked in texture, though they were fried?! The Salsa, two kinds. Watery and pasty. The watery one was the standard, this was bland and tasted semi metallic, like it was canned tomato, cheap canned tomato...not Tutti Rossa. The second was also standard, a pasty, thick very bland with a spice no heavier than Taco Bells Hot sauce. Gringo town, here we go. Yes, ok then. I know that Chips and Salsa are free, well, generally. I could not eat them if i did not like them...very true! BUT, salsa kinda sets the stage because I'll be using it for the rest of the night and I don't want it to suck. Here's the Gwylo run down. Tacos, Cheese Crisp, Pollo Fundido, Bean Burrito fried and enchilada style, Chili Relleno. Honestly, they were all terrible. The Beans are really bad, not that the food was cooked wrong or was not fresh, because it was...I just did not like their recipes. The beans were an off putting, loose (Weird) brown. The Crisp was very, very oily and not very crispy. Yada, yada. One of the worst though, and I shit you not, was the Enchilada sauce. The Red Enchilada sauce. I think..um, this is the M & P brand from food city. It's chalky and dry, very salty with an earthy, dirt kinda taste followed up with a tinge of steel. It taste like it, Im pretty sure it's M & P...I know this because I used the M & P brand on a Pork Shoulder in a pinch for unexpected guests and I used it. It sucked when I made it too. 
 I't would and would not surprise me if this place makes it. It's in a high rent area and they need to contimually pack people in to keep it operating. The good news is Mexican food is very popular, most people have bland buds and it's sophisticated looking enough that may make certain crowds crown the place acceptable. The bad news, food just sucks and AZ has some of the best Mexican food in the country. My server was very good, the place was very clean. FLLLUUURRRRP! Bummer. I kid you not, and I know this is soup-uh cliche...but Taco Bell food has more flavor. FLAVOR...not quality. Don't get it confused Yelp Nazis.",2016-03-07 22:12:49

When you walk in you see mostly just the bar and couches and coffee tables full of people drinking, eating, and being merry. I was slightly intimidated being a party of 1 since it looked like all the tables were communal. I was delighted when the host turned a corner to another room that looked more like a typical dining room. I love the decor, the style, the bathrooms, all lovely. Rustic, industrial, modern, comfy. Lively and energetic ambiance without being too loud. Casual, but nice. I feel like I could return with my kids. 5 stars for ambiance.

Service was great. Hosts were really friendly, servers were attentive. Food runners were a little more attentive than my actual server, but she was still very nice. 4.5 stars for service.

The menu was creative. A modern twist on southern/american favorites. I came for the Restaurant Week menu which was 3 courses. I chose the fried green tomato blt, blue plate special, and ended with creme brulee. The runner actually brought out deviled eggs first, but when I notified him I had ordered the blt he left the eggs so I could have both. Deviled eggs were good but a little much for me. A little salty, herbs a bit overpowering. Just not my thing. The BLT was very good. It was my first time having fried green tomatoes, which I loved. The pork belly was delicious. The spread that was on top of the tomato was, again, a little much for me. Nice flavor, but too intense for me. The main course was the blue plate special, which was fried chicken, biscuit, spiced watermelon. The spiced watermelon was interesting, a great palate cleanser. The biscuit was delicious! The fried chicken was nice and crispy, but once again, very seasoned which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just not ""my"" thing. I ordered a side of the gravy they serve with biscuits and gravy which was creamy, rich, and meaty. If it hadn't had rosemary in it I would have really loved it. It seems like chefs love to use rosemary here in Vegas because it grows EVERYWHERE. But that's the very reason why I don't like it much anymore; I smell it every time I walk through my front yard. Enough of that tangent. 3 stars for food.

Here's what I loved: The Arnold Palmer and the Creme Brulee!!! 
I know you're thinking, Arnold Palmer? She's impressed with iced tea and lemonade? Yes, I'm off the sauce currently so I really love when restaurants create delicious non-alcoholic beverages. This is one of the best drinks I've ever had. I'd return just for the Arnold Palmer. Oh, and the creme brûlée. Again, you're thinking, creek brûlée? What is this, 1990? But their take on it is absolutely delicious. 5 stars for dessert and drinks. By the way, their drink menu looked pretty amazing. If their cocktails are made with the same care as the iced tea and lemonade, you should give this place a try.

All in all I had an enjoyable lunch. I might return and give them another shot.",2017-06-28 10:42:51

The food was tasty, but a bit disappointing. The menu is not very large and of traditional American inspiration (syrup and rib-eye, eg). It feels very Pittsburgh in a way: large portion that fills you more than fulfill. The two dishes we tried were a bit dry. It's not exactly cheap, so for that price I expected something a bit better.

On the other hand, they have some beer from east end brewery. So, you can forgive a lot. 

I may be back for lunch.

Update: I have now been there a few times for lunch. I'd say that it is a good 4 stars for lunch. Nice pizzas, nice burgers, reasonable price, quickly served, great location for lunch. In fact, it has become my favorite place for lunch in Oakland. So, 4 stars instead of three. Still, unlikely I'll go there for dinner, though.",2012-03-01 17:34:30

Hue Thai has lots of variety of food.  And a lot of it is pretty good, too.  The problem here is the price.  They used to be really cheap; a good value and inexpensive food.  But since their popularity grew, they started to increase their prices significantly!  The banh mi is still good, though in comparison to other places (Pho Thanh Huong) the size is way too small, and the price way too high.  The pho is good too.  Another plus is the fact that the food comes out almost instantaneously.  They have big TVs on the walls and always have nice music.  There's good and bad here.

  Another drawback is that it's either cash, or spend more than $20 to pay by credit.  This is a completely ridiculous rule that has now caused them to lose a customer forever.  I know very well the rationale behind it, and I know I should feel thankful that they now accept credit cards at all, when they didn't for so many years, but it really set my friend off today, especially since we were trying very hard to save money by sharing and so forth.  Our total check was $10, but we had to spend $20 to pay because we only had credit.  He vowed never to come back.  For my part, I might, but only when someone else suggests it.

Walked past PACKED bars/restaurants in Fashion Square (Kona/Yard/Z Tejas) that obviously are much bigger hits than this. 

One bartender for bar and bar area by patio (Zach). Very slow service. He's not fast or efficient and needs which compounds the problem. I also put this on management for either the staffing and/or layout of bars, point of sale terminals (which he spends way too much time doing). Doesn't clean off bar, every customer needs something constantly.

It's not clear on beer list what beers are served in a pint glass or a tulip.

Pet peeve - no beer prices on menu. Why? Because they're very pricey. 

Bartender said reverse happy hour starts at 10:30pm but menu says 9:30pm 7 days a week. Need to give accurate info (He had to check the computer to see). It does start at 9:30pm.

Coors Light pint is $4 on HH? And only one other beer on HH? Lame! Plus, way too much head on the beer pours.

They do have a lot of HH food options. Brussels sprouts good. Kale salad was small and had almost nothing but Kale on it, despite menu description.

Wasting a HUGE TV behind the bar with music videos.  The other two are showing a replay of an NFL game. Meanwhile there's a Cubs Dodgers MLB game being played (But not shown on any TVs here). Boo. 

Who I think was the manager (only one wearing white shirt) was surly in response to a simple/friendly question and answered while he kept walking away from us. Front bartender Chris was not friendly.

As it gets closer to closing time (midnight) you will start to see more hustle by the staff than you've seen all night - they are all just dying to close up shop, and make it very obvious to anyone left after 11pm (which is not many). Guess we all just can't wait to leave.

They have entrees that the chef prepares according to what he feels like cooking (so neat)! I had the salmon with rice pilaf and carrots in a delectable sauce! It was so delicious and I ate every last bit of it! We also had some bruschetta which was AMAZING!

I ordered the kyoukka ramen with original fat and mild spice. I enjoyed the broth which was rich and full of flavour with the fat pieces in it. The mild spice was a small dallop of chili oil and it gave the ramen that extra spice that balanced out the oiliness feeling of the broth. 
The ramen had 1 slice of chicken and 1 slice of pork. The meat was flavourful and not dry but the slices were on the smaller side.
Not a big fan of the noodles that they had as they were not as chewy as I wanted for my ramen. 

The ramen had decent portion size ($11), enough to fill me up but it still left me with room to eat afterwards. The restaurant is small with limited seatings so it was more tight between each tables. 
Overall, this is a good ramen place to come to when you're in the area. The broth would be the main reason why I would come back to eat.",2016-11-10 22:10:54

I hate the dim sum places that serve by cart. By the time the cart arrives at your table, the food is cold since it's probably been around the whole restaurant TWICE and has been left out too long.

My friend and I ordered the two chicken tender combo (upgraded fries to be loaded) and the BBQ chicken sandwich.  Our bill totaled around $25, which is ridiculous.  Our food was good, but not $25 good.  The chicken is juicy and flavorful, but my tenders were a little chewy.  The fries are pretty good, but not really worth the $2 upgrade for loaded fries.  If you care, the bacon they use is much better quality than fast food restaurants!  Probably could have used more cheese, though.

The sandwich has their fried chicken, cheese, bacon, and sauce- pretty standard.  The bun is super soft, which I think rounds out the sandwich and makes up for the price (around eight bucks).  I added just a little more BBQ sauce because I like a messy BBQ sandwich.  This is what I would order if I returned.

We got pork dumplings, I didn't like how there was ginger mixed in with the pork but still overall delicious. I ordered the VOLCAN (spice level 1: medium) and the portion was ALOT. It was way more than their normal bowls, which also reflects this difference in the price ($12 vs $9). The volcan came with chicken broth and karage chicken as well, egg, onions and a garlic miso base. I thought the broth was okay, it wasn't my favourite broth. I prefer something more creamy like the broth at yokata yakabai on drolet ave or atelier asie in Chinatown mtl. The volcan also came with FAT noodles which I did not know, I usually prefer the smaller skinny noodles. My bf ordered the pork spicy tonkotsu & his review is similar to mine. We weren't a huge fan of the broth but his noodles were skinny and we both loved it. Overall I would return to this place, but I wouldn't order the volcan or tonkotsu again, would probably try their shoyu (soy based chicken broth)!

Came back here on a Friday night, and saw around 5 Asian families, 2 families with elders. Good sign since many Asian elders are really hard to impress (mine at least). 

Service is just stellar. The waiter was very attentative and it shows he's passionate about his job. He recommended an alternative fish to give us freshness instead of a frozen fish. Our waiter also had a kid of his own, so he got along well with our coworker's twin babies. Lastly, he showed us how to pull the last remaining meat from the tail of the lobster without destroying it. It was super tender and just orgasmic. 

Lobster, sea bass, beef and mushroom with oyster sauce, and steamed cod was all great. Only issue was the fried tofu needing a sauce since it was like just eating french fries. I recommend the sweet and sour sauce.

Upon arriving, we were greeted by the hostess who was very friendly.  She and another hostess debated on where to seat us - and the 1st hostess suggested a low top since my guest was quite short.  I'm glad she noticed. :)  

Our server approached shortly after, and I am so mad I forgot her name, but she was courteous, friendly and knew her stuff.  We started off with the calamari and the bbq bacon wrapped prawns.  Both were delicious and the prawns were quite large and meaty.  Ashley, the event coordinator also stopped by to introduce herself - she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu. 

For entrees, I ordered the pork cubano - I have to admit, this was my least favorite dish of the 3 that we ordered.  There were 2 types of meat in there and one of them was just not hitting my taste buds right. I actually couldn't finish it.  The fries that came with it were delicious though.  Perfectly crunchy.  Another person at our table ordered the filet mignon over mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The filet was perfectly cooked at medium rare and tasted divine.  The texture was great.  And the 3rd person at our table had the salmon risotto - that was hands down, the favorite of the table.  It was creamy and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I'd definitely order that dish again.  

For dessert, though full, our server suggested the blackberry cobbler with a scoop of ice cream on top.  It was great and the 3 of us shared it.  Without the sweetness of the ice cream, it would have been a bit tart, but with the ice cream, made it perfect. 

Overall, our experience was wonderful.  Extremely friendly staff, food presentation was impressive and food was great (minus the cubano...sorry!).

To add to the authenticity, the menu is in both Spanish and English, and they have Spanish music playing over the radio.
My hsuband and I both got the Super Burrito - his in carne asada, mine in chicken, and they were good. The Super Burrito comes with beans, meat, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. The meat was good, but the highlights for me were the fresh, chewy tortilla, and the pinto beans. They tasted like the ones your friend's nana would always be making in the kitchen back in middle school. (if you had friends like mine). Price was around $6.50 for a super burrito and a few chips. Note that despite the name, the burrito is not huge Chipotle size.

While service is good, and we like the Friday and Saturday night bands playing, there are a few things that are starting to bother us about CKs.

The only food items we really enjoy are the fries, the wings, and the zucchini. We've tried different burgers, sandwiches, and a couple entrees and it's just boring and bland, or the portions are too small for what you're charged. The burgers are pretty good size but their sandwiches aren't and regardless of which you get they seem to gyp you on fries. Last night my sandwich came with 4 big fries and about 6 or 7 little skimpy fries. My boyfriend ordered the hatch chili burger which we were told was an open-faced burger. While that's fine, they didn't give him the top bun. Generally an open-faced sandwich means both the top and bottom pieces of bread are laid on the plate and all the other messy ingredients are poured over top and you eat it with a fork and knife. CKs only gave him the bottom bun. When I looked over and saw that he had barely eaten half of it and I knew he didn't like it. This man tears through a good burger. He said it was really bland. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all. He was also gyped on fries. We've noticed this happens every time we order burgers or sandwiches. The same seems to be happening with their appetizers. The first few times we came here we would always order the zucchini and the wings. They used to fill the $8 basket of zucchini up, now it's barely enough for us to share. The zucchini is so freaking good but it's no where near worth $8 or ordering it anymore.

Lastly we're getting a little tired of waiting for the bands to play at 9:30pm. We really enjoy the music but with our very early work schedules we're used to going to bed quite early so on weekends we're ready for bed by 9:30pm. Lame for us, I know, but there are many other bars or restaurants where the music starts at 8pm or even 7pm. Also, their website isn't accurate anymore on who's playing. We went last night because the website said Broken Toys was playing and we really enjoyed them last time. However it was a different band who never introduced themselves and who weren't as good. Sad...

While we still like CKs, we most likely would eat dinner else where and just come for a couple drinks and some music...if we're willing to stay up.",2014-04-20 15:33:39

I heard about this place through word-of-mouth.  I was specifically told to ask for Ian Counts.  He does a heck of a job.  I've never left disappointed.  Everyone working there is extremely pleasant and they're all very laid-back.  Beer, coffee, wine, soda -- it's all there for your enjoyment while you get trimmed and styled.  Local art on display adds to the fun feel of the joint.  The stylists offer product and styling suggestions.  They also use the products firsthand.

Occasionally they host special events, such as art crawls, etc.  Some are even in conjunction with their neighbor, Pint Central.  The side of the building was recently tagged with the infamous Charlotte #BartArt as well.  It's definitely a great place to checkout.  I find it relaxing, and always feel refreshed and refined after having sat in the barber's chair.

Best of all my mom (who by the way is super picky when it comes to Mexican food) loved it!!! We had tacos al pastor and tripas. Both were bomb!! I also order a small caramelo (cheese and carne asada flour quesadilla). It was good but for my taste, carne asada was a bit salty.  They have a salsa bar with different kind of salsas, pickled carrots, cabbage, onions and limes. I tried the red and toasted chile sauces. Both lack flavor and heat. I usually love the pickled carrots but this ones had no flavor. They didn't even tasted like carrots. We also order a carne asada and bean burrito to go for my wife. Well she didn't like it so much but because they were very skimpy with the beans. She liked the carne tho.

Take my three star review with a grain of salt, as it's hard for me to get into high end organic diners, which this is.

Pros:
Great ambiance; as far as the decor goes its really comfortable and cozy

Great service; our waiter was so friendly, but not overbearing.  A great mix of friendly and distant.

They make everything there - smoke their own bacon, make their own english muffins, even make their own ketchup.  It's a cool idea, and mostly successful

I had the eggs benedict, and it was cooked perfectly,  Eggs were great, and the hollandaise avoided being overly rich.

Hesitations:
A bit on the pricey side...but that comes from them making everything there.  Most brunch things were around 12 dollars, which isn't unreasonable considering they make everything there.  It is expensive enough to keep me from going too often.

Cons:
The coffee was 2.50! That's crazy talk.  

The ""salad"" that came as a side for my meal was just huge pieces of lettuce with a light lemony dressing which may have just been spillage from the hollandaise sauce.  It was more of a lettuce side than a salad side.  I should've opted for the potatoes.",2011-04-22 20:12:51

The service department is a joke, I have dealt with Greg, the ""service manager"", & I have had to take my car back 4 times within the last 6 months because they did not fix what they said they did. & these are things covered under a warranty that I have paid for. Every time the car has been brought in Greg says what was fixed in addition to other things that needed to be replaced under warranty & then says a list of other things that needs to be fixed (not under warranty) ranging from $500-$1100, I'm assuming that if you don't agree to allow them to fix these other things that they just don't fix anything at all. 

On one occasion when my transmission pan was supposed to be fixed, I went to get my tires rotated at another shop & the guy working on my car said it was still leaking, took it back to Greg & it was supposedly fixed. Took my car in for a oil change at a different shop & they said my transmission pan was STILL leaking!! 

Just took my car back for another oil change & they said the oil pan was leaking, took it in to Greg & he says they replaced it, guess what?!!! Took it back to the shop to ask them if it looked liked it was fixed & NOPE!! Looks the same!! 

UPDATE:
Greg texted me to let me know that he seen my review & that they did not replace it they resealed it. What's the point of paying for an extended warranty when all they do is reseal instead of replace??!! Let's just put a band aid on it until the warranty is no good & now you have to pay out of pocket for it!! Livid!

When I moved to Calgary 4 years ago, I stayed with a family friend who lived in Calgary but worked further up north.  In the 2 months I stayed at his place, I saw him twice.  It was a nice place, in Kensington, free, but lacking a fully functional kitchen.  Due to incomplete renovations, it wasn't an option to eat at home.  So, for 2 months, I frequented several establishments in Kensington for my dietary needs.  Peppino was a frequent stop.

Peppino has a wide variety of sandwiches, daily pasta specials, some cold pasta dishes, deserts, and a lot of Italian foods and coffees (it doubles as a small Italian grocery).  I've tried most of their sandwiches, but since moving out of Kensington I usually enjoy the Crantastic Turkey on my return visits.  All their sandwiches are available on white or whole wheat, and while classified as sandwiches, they are essentially subs that are prepared on sub bread.

Another favourite of mine is the Surprise.  Basically, they will throw anything they feel like on your sub.  It's always delicious.  They also have a great selection of sandwiches that do not contain pork, which is important for me as my fiance doesn't eat pork and I rarely indulge myself.  All sandwiches are prepared fresh in front of you, and like a real Italian place should, they don't wear gloves when preparing your food (which is good, because we should occasionally invite germs into our bodies, otherwise we become ill-equipped to fight the bigger badder ones).  But this might not be your thing, you mysophobe you.

The service at Peppino is great.  Always polite, cheerful, and never too busy that you have to wait forever.  Even during a lunch rush, they are fast and efficient.  I've seen lines out the door move quickly, so don't be intimidated if it's busy.  If you haven't gone, go, and if you have, where is your review?",2009-10-16 20:51:43

Stevie's specializes in New York style pizza, which you can order either by the slice or as a whole pie. They also offer your usual calzones, salads, wings, and pretty much everything that you'd expect at a place like this. Sadly, there are similar pizza places found on every block that aren't really all too different than what's found here.

My girlfriend and I stopped by for a couple of pepperoni slices, as well as six of their garlic knots. Prices are definitely reasonable, so that you should make most people happy. And the food itself was by no means awful, it's just kind of underwhelming.

In comparison to what I've had recently, they seem to be just running through the motions. Crust is standard, sauce and cheese were present, although not really stood out to me as having, as another reviewer put it, a ""bold flavor."" Realistically, pizza of this caliber is very easy to duplicate.

My rating hovers somewhere in the 2-3-star range. There's nothing overtly wrong with the food, but this isn't quite what I find myself craving when it comes to New York-style pizza.

As there are no cheesecake factories in Michigan, my friend insisted on going to Cheesecake factory. I've never been that huge of a fan of the place- I mean, it's just a restaurant (always reminds me of Chicago's Grand Lux Cafe) with cheesecake. Meh?

-Roasted Pear and blue cheese pizette: pretty good with the spinach leaves on top. It was kinda strange with the pecans? but still, pretty good.
-Crabcake bites- Mmmm. I was surprised at how well these were cooked. Usually crabcakes are dry-ish when they're deep fried, but these crabcakes were tender and just plain good.
- Fried macaroni cheese balls- it sounds strange, but omg, so amazing. The deep fried balls explode with cheese, as the mac n cheese is hidden inside the deep friedness. Oh man, so so so good. This was my favorite of the night.

For dessert, we ordered the kahlua cheesecake. OMG, SO SO SO GOOD! I'm usually am not a fan at all of cheesecake, but the cheesecake mousse mixed with chocolate and kahlua was amazing. And so rich. We took it home to finish.

I had never really noticed or heard of Saigon before last week. Now, I'm telling everyone I know how great it is. Let me start out by saying that this is primarily a Vietnamese restaurant, but they have a large selection of traditional Chinese dishes as well. Their Vietnamese 'bun' options are actually very similar to pho, and not a 'bun' at all. There are just some things us outsiders don't understand. 

I was craving Chinese, so that's the cuisine I stuck with this time around. And boy, Saigon does Chinese better than a lot of other actual Chinese restaurants I've been to in Charlotte. I started with the egg drop soup, which is very flavorful and had a nice consistency. Not that thin, watery kind you find at many places. For my entree I went with the [extremely basic in the best way] General Tso's chicken. First of all, let me commend them for actually not up charging for fried rice. YOU DA REAL MVP. Secondly, the portion was huge. I made two meals of of this dish. Lastly, it was incredible. You could tell the chicken was freshly breaded and they used premium cuts of poultry. It wasn't the standard thick & crispy fried chicken you find in general tso's sauce ... it was breaded the way sweet & sour chicken typically is, and I am here for it. 

This is definitely going to be one of my go-to places when I'm craving any sort of Chinese noms. 

Pro-Tip --- they've got a plethora of bubble teas. The good kind. You're welcome.",2018-04-04 17:45:22

Kirin Patisserie is a newly opened cafe and dessert shop brought to you by the folks from Tendou Matcha. I was a big fan of their soft serve so I was looking forward to see how this place is. However given the items that I tried, I must say it was a bit underwhelming:

Mont Blanc ($7.50) - A chestnut based tart. The top layer had a nice chestnut flavour and it wasn't too sweet either. However, the chestnut layer was a bit dry and crusty. Most likely because it had been left out for quite some time. 

Tarte Tiramisu ($7.75) - They use the same tart base as the Mont Blanc except there is chocolate cake inside the tart. It was not bad but would have liked the coffee liquor flavour to be more pronounced. 

Choux a la Creme ($4.75) - The texture of the cream was nice but matcha flavour was not too prominent. Others may find this to be bland with a hint of matcha bitterness from the after taste. 

For the price of the tarts, I expected a higher level of quality. If they are trying to emulate Duo Patisserie (which is at the same price level) then they have a long ways to go as their pastries are not near their level. Also it would be nice if they had a short description written below each item on their tags rather than just the name and price. It will provide more context and appeal to the customers.

The person that was taking orders was quite welcoming and approachable. She was able to provide feedback and recommendations quickly as well.

They are having a soft opening from 3/10 - 3/19 and there will be limited quantities of pastries available. Unfortunately their soft serve machine was out of service so we did not get to try it.

They will have new items rotating thru their menu as well so I will be on the lookout for that. Hopefully there will be some improvements down the road.",2018-03-16 02:19:03

Their menu changes daily depending on ingredients the chef can get his hands on.  The chef is from Maine originally and thus is a stickler to high quality seafood; the restaurant actually gets all their seafood shipped directly from the suppliers instead of through distributers.

I've tried their duck confit and pate as appetizers.  I was originally surprised to see duck confit listed, as it's not a dish I have run across in Pittsburgh ever (if you know where I can get it, let me know!).  Both appetizers are definitely worth having again.

I've tried their lamb chops; perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium rare.  Their cassoulet is rich and hearty and perfect for the cold winter months.  The proteins they use are sausage, pork, and duck confit along with the beans of course.  The flavors were rich, but it was a tad too salty for me, and my palate already prefers the food I eat to be heavily seasoned.

They do take reservations now, so that's always a good thing.  They're also BYOB ($4 corkage).  And every now and then they have special events for special occasions, so definitely be on the lookout for those as well.",2010-03-15 06:48:49

It was like a scene from a movie and the ambiance was perfect. I think this would be a great spot for drinks (they mentioned they might add a live band which would be an added bonus!)

For the food: the best way for me to describe the food is that it's different. It's not your average southern fried chicken joint, they put a twist on everything. 
Also, we tried some of the unusual items that I've never heard of before, we wanted to be adventurous! 


Here is what we ordered:

Quail egg- very good quail (my first time trying that) but it was a little weird nibbling on the bone, it's much smaller that a chicken (obviously) but the meat was tender and juicy.

Pork Croquette- I have to admit, when I saw it come out, I was a little uneasy about it. This is probably the most unusual item I have ever ordered. I only took a small bite and could not stomach the rest. My friend tried more of it and described it as sort of creamy and rich. 

The pork belly BLT - a fried green tomato, house made jam with pimento cheese, pork belly and topped with frisée. This was my second favorite item! It all came together so well and the pork belly was like a thick cut piece of bacon, this is definitely worth ordering.

Watermelon and feta- my most favorite item. They grilled the feta cheese so it was still warm and the watermelon was cold. It was a perfect combination that sent my taste buds into a frenzy! Only 3 pieces came on a plate, so of course we ordered more.

Mango salad- the pecans were smoked, but I think candied pecans would have been better. The salad really missed here and flavors were very underwhelming. 

Deviled eggs: the presentation is the most impressive part! They look so neat with their tiny little layers leading up to the peak. Unfortunately, I thought they were dry and lacked flavor. They didn't seem fresh, it tasted like they had been in the fridge for some time.

All in all, I probably won't be back for the food, but if I am in the area, I might stop by for a drink and some music considering the atmosphere is delightful.",2015-02-02 17:05:25

Being that we did not want to sit and eat at the overly crowded bar at Comme Ca, we walked over to Holsteins. We had to wait for a seat here too so I was really freakin hungry when we sat down. 

One bummer about this experience was they did not bring out any complimentary popcorn. *womp womp*

Other than that our server was very nice and helpful. He knew the menu well. BUT. My friend and I knew we were getting the Billionaire Burger because we HAD to have a burger with foie gras in it. Yep. This burger comes with a big chunk of grilled foie gras right in the burger. It has Kobe beef with frisee, port-onion marmalade and truffle mayonnaise. DANG. If you don't feel like hitting the high-roller tables after this burger something is wrong with you. I also added some cheese to mine. 

We also split the ""Snickers, Please!"" dessert, which was decent, but I would suggest going with one of their bomboozled milkshakes and have it WITH your burger instead.

I ended up having the chili Mac hot dog with a veggie dog. It was $9 and I had it with a side of fries. I shared it with my partner, and it gave our stomachs enough to be full for 3-4 hours. So why the three stars? For a $9 hot dog - I expected more. The veg chili was okay, the Mac n cheese was good, the pita or as they call it...naan was probably not homemade, AND the veggie dog was for sure store bought (Smart Dog).

The waitress was a bit concerned that we didn't want seasoning (they offer a seasoning option, sea salt, soy sauce or miso paste) but we usually find most  ramen to be on the salty side so we passed. Once we got our ramen and tasted it we realized why she insisted on seasoning, she explained that they do not add any salt or seasoning to their soup bases so we asked for some soy sauce on the side. With the soy sauce, the soup was better however it now tasted strongly of soy sauce so I'm not sure what the best choice would have been, maybe the miso option would have been best but that's a $2 up-charge. 

We also had the karaage don which was delicious. The chicken was crispy and flavourful and the rice was seasoned nicely. 

While the flavour was not as rich or pronounced as other ramen places, it still hit the spot, the meat and toppings were good and I'd go back to try the chicken base which is supposedly what they are more known for.  

The service was good and the restaurant is clean with communal style bench seats and long wooden tables, also some booths on the sides. Prices are on par with other ramen places, same with appetizers.

The prices are very affordable, less than $6 for a chicken roti and about $6.50-$7 for a boneless chicken roti or boneless goat roti. There are also other Trinidadian staples like currant rolls, doubles, stewed oxtail with rice, tamarind balls, etc but I l didn't try anything else besides the rotis and doubles.

The rotis here remind me so much of home, I had the boneless chicken and boneless goat, both were great. The boneless goat roti is in a darker curry sauce as a result of more geera in the curry while the boneless chicken is more yellow. The rotis here are ""saucier"" than rotis I have had at most places back in Trinidad or anywhere else in Toronto, so it maybe messy to eat at a park (I was going to take my food to go to eat this at High Park but seeing the amount of sauce deterred me).  The pieces of meat are tender but not dry or fatty. The boneless chicken roti is made with only breast meat, so the fact that it was not dry was impressive. The dalpourie which is the wrap was thin enough and nicely cooked (I like rotis that have that ""poxy"" look derived from a nice hot  cooking plate).

Overall, I really loved the roti, the only complaints I have are (1) that the roti does not automatically come with channa, you have to pay extra, all rotis come with curry potatoes though, (2) that they close at 8pm on most days and 9pm on Fridays, that is kind of early but maybe I am just a night owl.

Overall, I think this maybe my new favorite place in Toronto for Trinidadian Roti, my hubby likes here too but prefer Ali's Roti shop, I disagree since I like the dalpourie at Island Foods more. My ranking for Trinidadian Rotis in Toronto right now are: (1) Island Foods, (2) Ali's Roti (3) Caribbean Roti Palace (rotis here are kinda dry)",2013-07-13 02:06:32

We've been to the location on Eastern twice and had good pizza and service both times. I figure since they're franchises, the food at least would be consistent. I was so wrong!

We were seated very quickly and our server came over promptly. I told her to bring all the food out as soon as it's done and she said she understands because the kids will start to go crazy if sitting there for too long. We started off with a caprese salad but when it came out, the tomatoes were pinkish white, not red. When you're serving a salad with only 3 ingredients, every one of them needs to be perfect. The kids didn't want to eat his very adult salad so we asked for bread as well as a dish for the balsamic and olive oil. 15 minutes later, still no bread so we flag down the server and she finally brings it out to us. The dish never came. 

15 minutes later, our pizza comes out. We ordered a red pizza with spicy pepperoni and mushroom. The middle was wet, not crispy like the Grimaldis on Eastern. The cheese was chewy, so you had to just chew and eventually swallow it whole because it won't separate. My 4 year old who loves pizza said that it was terrible because the cheese keeps falling off of his floppy wet pizza. 

When we finished, we wanted to order the cookies and cream cheesecake but nobody looked at us for a very long time. After looking around, we realized that there was only one server, one manager, and three busboys for 15+ tables. It was ridiculous!! We sat there for so long that we decided not to get dessert and when we flagged somebody down, I just gave them my card without seeing the receipt because I didn't want to wait for them to pick up my card. When I got home and checked my bank account, I had two pending charges of the same amount from Grimaldis. 

If we eat at Grimaldis again, we are making the drive to Henderson. This locations seems like it wants to save money by under staffing and picking sub-par ingredients.",2011-05-28 01:07:44

It wasn't that the food was bad, it was actually good. What killed the experience for me was the horrifically bad service and the ridiculously loud music.

I arrived at Holsteins at about 9:15pm on a Monday night, walked up to the hostess desk, and after being ignored for a few minutes was ""greeted"" by the snottiest hostess in the whole world. After some exasperated sighing and excessive eye-rolling I was told that they were full, the waiting list was full, and they wouldn't even take my name for the waiting list until after 9:30. Boom, that was it....and then she walked away. We were aghast! WTF? Oh, GAME ON! So, I walked 3 feet away, pulled out my phone, and looked at Opentable.com. Oh hey, look at that...there are reservations available for Holsteins...now. I promptly made a reservation for 4, pushed send, got my confirmation, and walked the 3 feet back to the hostess desk. Phone in hand and with a gigantic smile on my face I greeted the snotty hostess and said I had a reservation. She once again grunted and rolled her eyes saying, ""oh, are YOU Carrie?"" After I happily confirmed that I was indeed Carrie...THE Carrie with the 9:30pm Opentable reservation Snotty Hostess said, ""I saw that you JUST made the reservation. (Eyes rolling up a storm) There is a long waiting list, but because you JUST made a reservation I will put your name at the top of the list. But just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table."" I honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. It would serve Holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.

Here is what we ordered:

Bam-boozled ""shakes"" all $11.00

Drunken Monkey
Frozen Grasshopper
Cereal Bowl
Black Cow

They were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. FYI, the Black Cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.

Burgers:

Gold Standard $17.50 - 
Longhorn $16.00
Steakhouse burger $16.50

All the burgers were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. I have indeed ""experienced better."" They are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to sweet potato fries. Sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. Additionally we ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes which were also mediocre.

Our server was fine, but not fantastic. The music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. Overall our experience was a less than stellar one. The experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. There are way too many other restaurants in Las Vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. I will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (I kid!

People in my office used to order from here all the time. At least 4 or 5 times each week - sometimes several deliveries in one day. And we considered it one of the best delivery options we had.
Then orders started getting messed up. More often then they were right. More people here refuse to order from Rosati's than are welcome to take the risk - knowing it's more than likely they won't get what they ordered or how they ordered it.
About six months ago, I ordered for three of us - and there were several issues. When I called, a woman claiming to be the manager offered me a $10.00 credit.
When I called for the next delivery and tried to get the credit, there was no record of it.
My last straw was last Monday. I thought I was brilliant by ordering online - where I could specify anything specific and it was all in clear print - no chance to mess up, right?  HA! I ordered a an Italian beef sandwich with peppers, onions and light mozzarella; a small Greek salad and a brownie for me. Also got cheese sticks with marinara for one coworker and the ""duo"" (shown on the menu as fried mushrooms and zucchini) with ranch for another.
Delivery came in one hour, 15 minutes. Everything was lukewarm, including the salad. The cheese sticks were barely edible. The duo came with cauliflower instead of zucchini (would not have been ordered at all if cauliflower had been advertised) and the ranch was missing. The mushrooms were referred to as glue by the coworker who ate one, and threw away the rest. My sandwich was OK. Not great, but OK. And the salad was fine - after I put it in the fridge for a few hours. I'd love to tell you about the brownie - but it wasn't with the order.
I called and spoke with a gal who claimed to be the manager. She offered me a credit, or she could send a driver back with the ranch, some zucchini and my brownie. No luck with the last credit I was offered - and I really didn't want to wait another hour for ranch (no longer needed, as the food it was requested for was thrown away) and my brownie. I asked those items be refunded to my credit card.
I was told the owners would call me the next day.
That was over a week ago.
Rosati's on Thomas - I am sad to say you have worked your way onto my DO NOT CALL list. My coworkers were right. I was wrong. Enjoy my money - you won't be seeing any more of it. And I can't think of anyone from my office who disagrees at this point.",2013-04-11 01:34:20

They also have really great looking desserts in a case in the front, which we haven't tried, but that seem to be pretty popular. If Bubba's would step up their game with the sides, it would be a really awesome place!",2016-05-07 19:00:00

Hands down the best fried chicken I have had.  We started with the cheese and charcuterie platter and that would have been enough food for the two of us. It had 3 cheeses a yellow cheddar a white cheddar and a blue cheese with two types of prosciutto and a meat spread.  The blue cheese was a little to serious for me (hints of horse hoof).  Other than that our platter was wonderful.  Our waitress (Lazetta) was very friendly and helpful. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and she was extremely happy.  I tried a bite of the waffle with the bourbon sauce and it was awesome.  I ordered the house chicken with a side of grits. I have never had a better tasting fried chicken in my life. The grits were cooked perfectly and were topped with cheddar cheese.  I liked them but I would have liked them better with a softer whiter cheese.  It is definitely a place that I will return to .,2018-03-15 21:34:45

Azteca fills the void between a generic Arizona Mexican fast food place and a sit down restaurant. You order at a counter, but the food gets delivered to you. The food is on a plate with a garnish, but the plate is disposable. 

The menu has all of the items one would expect, tacos, burritos, flautas, tortas etc. The one unique part you might notice stems from the ""& bakery"" part of the name. On the wall there are shelves full of fresh Mexican baked goods, like cookies.

I opted for a Chilie Rellno burrito $4.25. Like all meals this includes a small carboard tray of corn chips while you wait. The only salsas are the traditional red and green sauce, they were good but nothing special. The burrito was quite good, inside a nicely warm and toasted tortilla was a fresh chillie rich cheese and smooth beans, all garnished with lettuce and cheese on the side.

Located in a nice neighborhood, although somewhat hidden, this place has a really cool atmosphere and friendly service.  Trendy music playing, it's a very inviting and ""warm"" place to eat!

I ordered the Thai beef jerky and one of the specials, salmon curry.  The Thai jerky was pretty good.  It came with a sauce that looked much more exotic than it tasted.  The sauce was rather bland.  That was ok though because the jerky itself had a nice roasted flavor.  It wasn't too chewy either!  

The salmon with curry was a slight disappointment for me.  I ordered it a 4/4 on the heat level, and it came out rather mild.  The taste of the curry, which was a panang style curry with moderate thickness to it, was rather bland.  A tad sweet, and thick, not offensive in any way, but bland.  The salmon was a nice big portion for $16, and tasted pretty good although a touch dry.  It came with American broccoli, which usually pairs well with this style of curry.  That was probably my favorite part of the meal.  They also give you a big portion of rice, so sharing would be an easy thing to do here.

Overall, this Thai restaurant is a good one if you don't like your Thai food too spicy or too flavorful.  For me though, I am not sure I can find a reason to go back.",2014-04-20 00:17:57

After attending the Wind Up gallery opening, Stevey and I were tired and looking for a quick something to do before retiring for the night (did I mention we were wearing flannel pjs and preparing for Judge Wapner?). I kept thinking of how Mike W. had helpfully offered his review of SOMETHING to do in Mesa. But every time I passed Sun Devils, I thought ""This shit is a trap. That place actually looks sketchy. No way it is nice inside."" 

I was wrong.

Entering the space, I noticed two hot hipster dudes and a huge looming tower of Fat Tire specials-what? And I zoomed in on the neon sign letting us know that there was a cellar. I was scard. I thought of Pulp Fiction. I love Stevey (and my ass). Is this shit a trap?

If a trap is actually a poor wine and beer lovers secret garden paradise, then YES.

Delicious beer cheap and on tap? Dove chocolates for yummers? A tub of orphan beers for a buck fiddy each that the bartender nicely opens for you as you settle your fat (unharmed) ass into.

On the way out, I noticed a hip lady I knew settling at a table with a hottie-we waved at each other and shared ""the look"" the ""oh yes- now you know the secret"". Well, I am sharing it without shame. 

There are plenty of tastings (including a CHAMPAGNE one) to sample their wares. I mean, would I recommend driving totally out of your way to come here? No. But should you totally stop by here after Mesa Arts or Wind Up? God, YES, you moron.

     An intriguing menu:  Mushroom, Goat Cheese and Spinach Strudel ($10); Bricked Fired Poached Tilapia with Sage Butter, served with Coconut and Shrimp Risotto ($23);
Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce ($13).

     An intriguing venue: A tiny place with old world decor - red walls, chandeliers, lots of empty wine bottles on the ledge behind the banquette, and a cute little patio with an amusing statue of a centurion outside the wrought iron fence.

     So what more could you ask? Regrettably, lots...

     We were four, for lunch. Ken and I arrived first and ordered an appetizer of Stuffed Mushrooms wrapped in Prosciutto ($8). It did not arrive until well after our friends, Leon and Sena came in. They wanted to try the Strudel, but were told it wasn't available. Our mushrooms were three of the ugliest lumpy things I've seen in a long time. They had been cooked in the pizza oven which pretty much incinerated the ham and dried out the mushrooms However, with enough of the accompanying Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce spooned over them, they were fairly tasty. Sena got a panini of eggplant in tomato sauce. The eggplant was almost raw, so it was chewy and bitter. Ken ordered Mussels in a Mustard Sauce ($10) served with Endless Bread. The jar of mustard had never found the sauce. Leon asked for a hamburger with ketchup. He was told that no ketchup was served in the restaurant because it would interfere with the bold flavors of the food. I would applaud this as a policy had there been any bold flavors. Ken quipped that most of the food seemed to have its roots in Britannia. My Espana Pizza ($14) had a nice amount of manchengo and mozzarella cheeses, but was pretty low on the chorizo topping.The crust was something of a disaster - burnt on the edges and flabby in the center.

     Service was poor.. With only two other customers in the restaurant, there was no excuse for ice tea glasses that were not refilled until we pointed it out, dishes that were not cleared from the table to make way for new ones, a long wait for Ken's entree to be served after the other three had arrived, and the lack of a bowl to put his mussel shells in. The restaurant also had a general air of sloppiness about it. I don't believe that chef/owner Eric Osburn was in the house while we were there, at least I hope he wasn't. But he needs to be more aware of what's going on when he isn't present.

Where to begin? So a former colleague and I, who no longer work in the same place, decided to dine here for lunch last Friday. I had never tried this spot, much less for lunch, so I figured it would be a great place to guinea pig for future outings, since we both still work in the area. What a mistake! 

What happened? Saturday I came down with a horrific cold. I was practically bed-ridden for the first day and can't even remember the last time I had been so sick. By sheer coincidence, my former colleague ALSO took ill over the weekend, at the same time, with the same symptoms. The only thing we had in common was that we ate lunch at this restaurant the day before and there's no way that we both got sick with the same thing, at the same time, by pure chance, especially since we don't even work together anymore.

My suspicion? Someone working in the kitchen was sick with the same thing and, though they had no business working, they did so anyways and got two of their customers horribly sick. I suffered like a dog and it ruined my entire weekend, all because I trusted this place with my health. What a joke.

And no, the server and the manager were not sickly, and we were the first people to sit at our table after the restaurant opened for lunch, so I'm going to stick to my guns that it was someone who prepared our food. It's just absolutely disgusting that management would let a sicko work the kitchen and infect their customers with a really nasty strain of of the cold or flu or whatever the hell it was they passed on to us both.

Outside of being a quick option after a late night out and needing some grease to sober up, the quality of pizza in these establishments generally leaves to be desired which is too bad because the concept is a worthy and useful one. Being able to grab a great quick slice of pizza while walking around is a great addition to one's neighbourhood. Over the past few months, there was indications that within St-Henri, a pizzeria was coming and bringing by-the-slice with it. On its own, not necessarily that exciting but when I heard that Tony Campanelli, owner of the wonderful cafe/store of the same name, was doing it.... well now you have my attention. Adamo opened up a couple of weeks ago so I passed by a couple of times to see how the pizza stacks up.

Adamo is a pretty simple place - a walk-up counter with drinks and pizzas ready to grab, a little bar to eat at there if you wish and the open kitchen behind for all to see the magic at work. The boxes of tomatoes and bags of flour add a nice rustic touch in the front of the room and the addition of the TV and the foosball table make the space have a more communal feel despite the lack of seating space. The pizzeria already feels like part of the St-Henri community after only a few weeks. Part of that is Tony's presence. Every time I have been, the place is busy and people are chatting with Tony and the rest of his friendly staff. You always get a nice hello and small talk from the staff. You don't feel like you just need to order and get out as fast as possible. That is greatly appreciated.

Pizza-wise, Adamo does what you would call New York-style pizza - as thin as possible and not too overloaded with ingredients. The individual slices are huge - the kind of slices that you fold in half to properly eat with one hand. The key there however is that despite being folded in half, the pizza holds up on its own, no limp crust here. Adamo nails that perfectly so far. The crust isn't too tight either which is nice. At the moment, there are 3 options - Mozzarella, Pepperoni and Basil - with one Pesto special available at times. Having tried all four, they are all solid. The base tomato sauce has a nice tang to it, the pepperoni has a nice kick, the cheeses are all gooey and plentiful and the pesto was very fresh. My one complaint would be that the basil pizza didn't really have enough basil on it.

Adamo is the best by-the-slice joint you can find in Montreal right now. Tony and company do it right all the way around so far and add to what is a great strip of Notre-Dame in St-Henri just by the Park. I needed a good pizza place not too far away from my new place.... and Adamo will do very nicely thank you.

The first time we went, we ordered the nachos and the meatball sliders.  I had a Bulleit on the rocks, and he had a pear slider. The bartender had to re-ask me three times for what I had ordered, but at least, I know I was getting the right drink.  Well, I wished that I would have confirmed the food as well because how meatball sliders turned into some kind of Asian shredded chicken sliders.  So we just said forget it and ate them.  In reading that the bartenders are knowledgeable I decided to ask for a sazerac, which was met with a blank look. I just said forget to myself and asked what he would recommend for a whiskey or bourbon cocktail.  Well, it was a whiskey and ginger.  I said sure and got well whiskey and ginger ale. Not sure why I wasn't asked what kind of whiskey but forget it.  It was like drinking in college.

On the second visit, we figured it was late, and we wanted to grab a quick bite.  I thought maybe we caught them on an off night on the last one.  Well, this time the bar wasn't busy, so we figure let's try those meatball sliders.  We were there during happy hour, but guess what?  The kitchen was closed.  Why you would have a happy hour food special and then have your kitchen closed is beyond me.  Now, this time around I loved the bartender.  Janda was great!  She and the decor are the sole reasons I'm rating this three stars.

With that said, there are better bars in the area, so unless we feel like giving this place a 3rd shot, I wouldn't go back.",2017-05-26 21:04:35

Food was okay, I have not been to Italy but I am sure that they have more flavor than this place on their streets. I was not impressed by their hottest hot sauce.

In some ways, it embodies a European sensibility--the communal dining, small menu, limited drink menu, rustic decor, and the uber-gracious hostess (who went out of her way to save a table for our large party when I called ahead) are all reminiscent of places I've been in Europe where dining is about simple flavors, good wine, and great conversation. Unfortunately, the portion size and unimpressive flavors of the tapas didn't quite live up to my expectations. After all, great atmosphere and sangria should enhance the food, not mask the fact that it's really overpriced and not that flavorful. 

Before you jump on me and tell me that tapas are supposed to be small portions, let me just go ahead and explain that I grew up in California where small plates restaurants are par for the course. I have absolutely no problem paying good money for a small plate that is really flavorful and is large enough for 2-3 people to get several bites of the dish. However, the plates at Lola were so small that in some cases, even after ordering 3 plates of a dish, someone in our party of 9 didn't even get one bite! The most laughable example was the gambas dish. The plate came with 4-5 tiny shrimp for $10 bucks or so! For $2 per shrimp (not even prawn!), we just gave up trying to order enough for everyone to have a solidly sized portion. The asparagus dish was similarly amusing - one $8 plate contained about 8 baby asparagus stalks. And when I say baby, I mean it. These suckers were like pinky sized!

I would have had a little more patience for the portion sizes (which already made me want to go down a burger after we left) if the flavors were brighter and more memorable, but that aspect of our meal was also a letdown. The daily special (bruschetta-like pieces of bread with caramelized onions, honey, and goat cheese) was very enjoyable and I thought the filet was tender (although kind of bland), but the pork tenderloin, gambas, and eggplant were completely uninspired. I thought the eggplant tasted like soggy eggplant parmesan and failed to see what made it Spanish. The tortilla espanola was the best dish by far but still fell a little short compared to the one at Sol y Sombra. 

Lest you think our experience at Lola was horrible, I want to remind you that I loved the cozy, rustic environment and that the hostess made the experience of showing up with a party of 9 at a place with communal seating a bit less stressful. Furthermore, I thought that the red sangria was really good (strong without being too sweet) and the pitcher was a pretty generous size for the price. I just can't get too thrilled about a place where the food--the crowning glory of any great European restaurant--isn't that flavorful and isn't generously enough portioned to allow everyone in the group to really share in the flavor experience. If I'm craving tapas in the future, I will head straight to Sol y Sombra or check out Imagine Spain, which I hear is worth the drive.",2008-12-14 22:57:15

Pros: It's cheap, about $4 for a burger. The quality of the meet is good, and the cooking crew knows what it's doing. The onion rings are also excellent -- actual rings of onions, no bits and pieces.

Cons: 1) Dingy, dirty, dark. I don't mind the rough and simple setup, but it would be nice if they cleaned all the drips and spots off the condiment bar from time to time. Finding tomato slices in the mustard is not pleasant. Garbage overflowing the barrels is also a problem. 2) The french fries are sub-par. They're undercooked, barely crispy.

We started off with a burrata caprese. I love that slightly boogery cheese and theirs is good. Plus that the tomatoes are small cherry tomatoes that have been roasted. 

For pizza, we got half the Big Apple. You can get either NY style thin round or a square which is a bit thicker like a pan pizza (not quite as thick as deepdish). We got the square and it was a crispy delicious crust. I love that the meats had a light sear but that the sausage slices got crispy good. My problem with most thicker pizzas is not enough sauce and their ratio was ideal and the marinara is solid. I'm a sucker for fresh basil and I love that they put ribbons of that on top. 

Service was constant, but unobtrusive. We were checked on, drinks filled and boxes and check didn't need to be asked for, but given when we looked done.

But after several visits, I'm sad to report I'll probably still need to be making those treks. 

First, don't be fooled by the sign that advertises it as a ""Korean house"". Despite the window signage, it's a Chinese diner that has 75% HK diner food. Fine. I like HK diners, but is it any good? After eating here 3x in the week it's been open, I can honestly say: meh.

Let's start with the good: nice modern decor, big tv flat screens, lots of tables, etc. The menu is extensive with familiar items of traditional HK cafes, as well as some ""Korean - style dishes"". I also like how the booths have USB power outlets so you can charge your devices.

Now the bad: I tried their sizzling steak and chicken combo and it's generous to say it was underwhelming.  First, the soup was supposedly a seafood bisque - it would be more accurate to call it Brown water with cornstarch to thicken it. No amount of salt or pepper could ressurect any sort of flavor.  The steak and chicken were fine but then the complimentary ice cream was melted upon delivery.  Wtf?

On a later visit I tried the bbq pork and egg with rice. Very standard for HK diners: slices of bbq pork laid over rice with a fried egg right? Not here. I got a BBQ pork omlette, which was fine, but a kind of surprising take on a classic. 

And in all time there, service has been abysmal. I'm use to Chinese level service trust me, but I practically have to beg them to get a refill on my tea, check on the status of my dish, or bring me the bill. They're not busy either! They just aren't trained to care.

My final conclusion? This place has a lot of potential. The food is fine and the prices aren't bad...unless they serve melted ice cream again.

Luckily, I also got a red velvet cupcake again which allowed this  establishment to remain a 4 star place just for the sheer glory of that cupcake, but come on people! There needs to be some quality control or something, because that sandwich was just sad.",2013-07-15 03:16:29

We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation and ended up sitting at the ""community table"" - long hightop table with bar stools to seat about 20 total.  This worked well for us, there is no place to wait (inside or out) if you are waiting for a table.  This is a cozy little place but the place was hopping and this was midweek no less.  Really glad to see such a full house for a brand new place.  This is the location of the former Jade Place on Hayden Road, right next door to TCBY Yogurt (another favorite of mine).

We all loved everything that was ordered and there was NOTHING left but the plates when we were done.  Salmon (perfectly cooked and seasoned) served some kind of tartar sauce on the side & asparagas, shrimp po-boy w/ tangy slaw, highly acclaimed gumbo (yumbo gumbo!!), club salad and fall off the bone BBQ ribs.  Thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  Service was prompt and pleasant.  What more could you ask for?  Dessert you say?  Yes, but we were too full for key lime pie.  Maybe next time.  We will be back for more sampling for sure.

UPDATE 3/27/13 - We've been back here a few times since that original visit and still give this place high marks.  Most recently we stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday.  Was hoping for patio seating but nothing available so we ate inside.  Guess what? - the food tastes the same wherever you are - it's all great.  I tried the portobello mushroom sandwich with grilled asparagas.  The sandwich was served on focaccia bread, cut into 4 little portions.  Fabulous and filling, I took half home and devoured later.  I really like the feel of this place - good music, comfortable seating, relaxed atmosphere.

She told us happy hour started at 2PM and was pretty outgoing, which is always a good thing. 

Drinks not during happy hour however, are pricey. $7-10 a drink. Food was $12-17 ish, smaller portions, shrimp tacos were not that good. Hard to eat, messy. The rice was really salty too. My friend's shrimp quesadilla was awful to me, she didn't mind it but I think she was just being nice.

I grab the 4 taco plate for $6 bucks with the mix of Al Pastore and Carnitas and it was excellent. Normally I don't do soda but the glass bottle Coke was calling my name and man it just set the meal off right. 

After eating we picked up some key items needed for an impromptu get-together the next day which included Al Pastore meat and Carne in which the butcher provides the marinade for both items. We also picked up a few sides, some fresh produce and plenty of limes along with the lime squeezer for the small limes which I've been looking for for quite some time.

Order the Smoked Marlin or Chicken Mole Tacos or a Quesa and enjoy the salsa bar.

Long Story -

You will be razzle dazzled by the ENORMOUS selection of salsas for you to try on the salsa bar. I think we were told seventeen but it might have been twenty. I tried the unusual creamy pecan salsa and a grilled vegetable salsa and whole lot of others that were very interesting.

One of the specialties of the house are the hand made Quesas. The Quesa was described as a quesadilla but seemed very different to me as I would describe it as a Mexican GINACOTTI or fried Calzone. We shared an all vegetable one stuffed with an assortment of vegetables including spinach and cheeses. It was very tasty and I like anybody would enjoy it. 

Out of the four tacos we tried the Smoked Marlin Taco and the Chicken Mole Taco were the best and the ones I'd recommend. The Smoked Marlin really tasted like Fish Tacos I had in Mexico. They were full flavored and dimensional with layers of cilantro and the right amount of smokiness and spice and that just right crunch. The Mole sauce from the chicken tacos was very well made and heavily coated the tender tasty dark meat chicken and was very good. 

Nothing was wrong with the beef or pork tacos but they seemed very average after the Smoked Marlin and the Chicken Mole.

The Quesa and the tacos were a very generous portion and more than we expected. I didn't think two tacos a person and a shared quesa would be that much food but it was.

Best tacos I had so far in Glendale.

Slight update 8-21-17

The first time I had was the Tsing Tao Peach.  What a combination!  You can really distinctively taste the peach mix with the Tsing Tao (which is a Chinese beer btw).  It's sweet, refreshing (perfect for the summer) and you can a little tipsy from it.

Other flavors I recommend include the Green Tea Whisky, Makegolli, Viet Milk Tea, HK Style Milk Tea, Seasame (THE BEST!).

You can order 1 or 2 flavors.  If it's your first time, definitely do more variety so you can know which ones you like.  If you're with a few friends, get a wide variety and share!

They also provide sampling if you're not sure how it will taste like (very nice and friendly staff).  You can also buy a tube home if you definitely know you want more of this delicious stuff!

I've been here quite a few times and the service and food are very consistent (except that one time they gave me an XL instead of the S I ordered - but hey, no extra charge!).

One of my boys from Chicago was feeling like heading out for sushi one night and suggested that we should come here, because he had been to their location in Chicago.  I didn't know what to expect other than he said it was waaay better quality food than Sushi Roku @ the W ... And he was not joking! The quality of food was much better here, and there was a lot more options! 

Since we didn't have any reservations and arrived fairly late - we sat @ the bar in the lounge area, and the bartender/server who took care of us rocked the house!  We ended up sharing/sampling several different things based on recommendations from the bartender.

THE FOOD:  Miso soup was def of high quality!! The scallops were amazing ...so light and delicious! The sushi was fantastic and that says a lot coming from someone who isn't a big sushi fan.  My fav was the Wagyu beef sampler we got, which was half traditional Japanese and half Australian cut - it was toooo die for out of this world - the best most tender perfectly cooked pieces of fine red meat I have ever had!! 

THE SAKI:  awesome, especially since our server recommended something that went well with our food choices.

The food, drinks, atmosphere, and service are all absolutely on point here!!  

But, this place is fairly expensive for the portion sizes, but keep in mind this is more of a gourmet type sushi experience - this is not the place that the average person can afford to frequent on a regular basis.  It's more of a special occasion type spot for most ... For that reason I have only been here a few times, and I deeply cherish the experiences I have had here ... It was the first time I had Wagyu beef and once you try it you will understand why it's sooooo pricey, but equally sooooo worth it once a year or so!! ;) 

I can't even think of one thing to criticize this place about ... They get it here.  Roka Akor is truly a fine Japanese style dining experience ... I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! ;)",2017-05-14 09:39:54

Yes, it was Valentines Day; but my wife and I have been together for 15 years and neither of us like to do Valentines dinner out for the obvious reasons (crowds, long waits, mediocre food, etc...).  We would rather enjoy each others company and have a good time just being together.

I have been going to Gallagher's on Fridays with a group of friends for lunch.  I have enjoyed my lunches.  So far, the service and all the food I have tried has been very good.  

So anyway, we walk in and grab a booth.  The server comes over, introduces herself and tells us she will be taking care of us this evening (standard for most places).  We ordered a couple of iced teas and checked out the menu.  

We ordered our meals and an appetizer that was on happy hour special.  This was about the last time we saw our server (other than her walking by and looking at the table).  The manager (I'm guessing on this, he could even be the owner...) delivered our appetizer, our meals, refilled our tea, checked to see how we were doing, etc...

Our server wasn't overloaded w/ tables, and the place was not packed (we went early, about 5PM), but it seems that we were an annoyance to her and not a table of customers that she was supposed to be ""taking care of"".  

She did show back up when we had finished our meals and asked if we wanted desert.  We declined because we were full.  She brought the check, I put my card in the folder for her to run.  When she returned the folder, she just set it on the table while walking by; no ""thanks"", no ""see you soon"", no ""go to hell"", nothing.

I won't put the server's name on here because I don't want to embarrass her.  I understand it was Valentine's day and maybe she didn't want to be there, or maybe it was because we were not drinking alcohol.  I don't know...

My wife and I are pretty easy, we don't ask for a bunch of substitutions, we're not needy.  Just bring us what we order, fill our glasses when they're empty, and check on us once in a while.  Do those things and you will earn yourself a nice tip (I usually tip about 25% up to 40%).  

I will also say that we had dinner on Friday night at the Gallagher's on Carefree Highway.  The food there was also very good, and the service was great (and they were busier than the Union Hills store was on Saturday).  Our server checked up on us a couple of times, the manager came by to check on us, even the young gentleman busing the tables wished us a good night.

There aren't too many tables in this restaurant and the atmosphere is really nice, very open and clean.  Upon being seated, we were greeted and our server was very nice and helpful.

The Hubs loved his, as did my Grandma and the grits, which I tried, were unique, creamy, and very flavorful. Grandma got the root beer float for dessert and loved it.  The Hubs and I shared a banana split, which I thought was just OK, the strawberry ice cream was my favorite part.

The decor is similar to the Baldwin location, but the spacing seems better due to the different floor plan.  My group of 4 didn't have to wait at all on Saturday night at 8pm.  This could be because not a lot of people know about this new location yet, or that there is just so many food alternatives in the Annex area to bother waiting. 

The pricing of the menu seems to be a bit cheaper than the Baldwin store, this location one even gives you the choice of thin or thick noodles that many of the rival Ramen places now offer too.  FYI - the thick is the regularly served Kinton noodles at Baldwin.  The Ramen is also similar to the original location, which is great!  The broth is thick and tasty yet not overly salty.

We had the pool view, which was nice. I really love the smell of Aria it has that sweet perfume smell. Rooms were clean, bed sheets nicely done, and restrooms was very clean.

The beverage bar is an awesome include - how cool is the all you can drink beer/wine/cider at lunch and dinner?!?

I had been before and was reluctant because I hadn't been that impressed with on my prior visit and I also didn't want to have another AYCE adventure to contend with.

We came here on a Saturday afternoon at lunch and the restaurant was not crowded at all. We were greeted warmly and taken to our table. Our server approached us quickly for our drink orders and gave us a rundown of the layout of the restaurant and all their offerings. We quickly headed to the salad bar while our waiter went to get our drinks. The salad offerings were slim. There weren't a lot of fresh veggies, but I enjoyed the mashed potatoes and kale, although it lacked a little flavor. 

On to the meat. The servers came out regularly and our server made sure that all the meats we wanted made their way out of the kitchen to us. I enjoyed that personal touch quite a bit. The meats were pretty good. My favorites were the pork, sausage and my fella really enjoyed the sirloin. I found it to be quite good as well. There wasn't as much selection as other Brazillian steakhouses we've been to, but the food was pretty good and we had an excellent meal. 

I would have given this place 3 stars for food, but I rounded up based on the great service we received. Our server was friendly and incredibly attentive. He never let the ball drop despite having to man the entire restaurant himself.",2012-12-05 03:49:26

I popped in for lunch today with three former coworkers. It's been a bit rainy and cold, so grabbing a seat was a bit of a challenge. We snatched up the open seats at the bar, and had a delicious little lunch.

My meal consisted of a shared portion of tots (complete with dipping sauces: jalapeno, chipotle, fry, ranch, ketchup, and hot) and a couple of their sliders (venison and buffalo). 

One thing to note, is on their exotic menu, they have rabbit. I really wanted to try this, but it was unavailable today. Next time! I'd also like to try their Mac n Cheese. Lot's of different options.

Since I have become a healthier eater since moving to Scottsdale, I think that I would share the Mac and Cheese with a good person.

While we were sitting at the bar, the manager (maybe the owner) made simple conversation with us. Gave us his opinion on some of the menu items, and was a nice guy. Didn't come off as a douche, or as a salesman. Came off as a friend at the bar. The way it should be.

All around, a great experience. Solid place for good food.

That is why, now that I am  older, I asked my boyfriend to splurge on some fine dining. Well, not only fine dining but AAA 5 diamond dining. 

I like ordering prix fixe menus (I splurged on the $145 menu) because it gives me a chance to sample the general style of the restaurant and chef without giving me too much of a headache. I was not disappointed in the least because the food was so tasty, fresh, tender, perfectly cooked to my liking, etc. 
The food was excellent. There was nothing that I didn't like. Here is a list of some things that were on the 9-course prix fixe menu for the day I went (it changes daily):
-Lobster salad 
-Sauteed Fois Gras with Macerated Fruit and Hazelnuts (YUM !!!!)
-Colorado rack of Lamb with Tender Vegetables and Lobster Jus

I was feeling adventurous and decided to hone my wine-aficionado tastes by adding wine parings to my meal (an additional $65). The best idea I've had this week. Chateau Gravas Saternes, I have found you as my new love :D

The service was prompt and helpful, yet not as attentive as other places I have been to. There is a spectacular view of the Bellagio water fountain show out of the windows.

The reason why I didn't rate this place a five, however, is that the tables are way too close to others, making it difficult to walk and just noisy in general. There were actually many large groups at this restaurant, and though I was happy that everyone was having a good time, it took away from the classiness of this place.

The line was pretty long, but it goes fast. The employees weren't rude, but they weren't overly friendly either. Just enough to get them by. 

So here's why I don't eat here ever...
1. The food gets cold fast. With all the lettuce, salsa or sour cream you pile on your food, no wonder everything you eat is cold after a few bites. 
2. The quality of meat they use was really crappy. The steak was really chewy and you could see the veins. 
3. They are super stingy with portions. I've eaten at this location a few times and have ordered different things. This last visit, the chick put 4 small pieces of steak in my taco. Another time I ordered a bowl and I only got a little scoop of rice even when I didn't have any beans. 
4. The flavors are pretty bland. If you don't drench your food in salsa or cheese or sour cream, you really can't taste much. I don't eat sour cream or cheese since it's extra calories I don't need to be eating. So it looks like I'm stuck with boring food. 
5. Their tortillas suck. They get hard and break so all your meat and stuff fall everywhere and you need a fork to finish eating your tacos. 

Anyway, to everyone that swears by this place, to each his own. But for me, I'll just stay away.",2014-06-28 04:07:09

By the end of the night, we're a bit sluggish but we want a quick snack before we call it a night. They only have a couple options for happy hour ($2 off select appetizers/sides) so we went with the truffle mac n cheese and the dry rubbed wings. The truffle mac n cheese was delicious! It honestly kinda tasted like the Krafts mac n cheese but I still couldn't get enough of it (or maybe it was the drunchies, not sure). You can never go wrong with truffle in mac n cheese so it was just a tasty dish.

The dry rubbed wings on the other hand were... not so great. I don't know what specific flavor ""dry rubbed"" tastes like but the wings definitely didn't taste like that at all. I found myself dipping it in the ranch sauce because I just needed flavor from somewhere and the wings themselves were not giving it to me.

For me, this is a place where I'd go for only the appetizers and sides during happy hour. I don't see this restaurant as a ""must go for dinner when you're in Vegas"" type establishment but it's still a decent place.",2018-04-16 05:24:58

I have always wanted to check out Grinders since right down the road from my house. My roommates have been there once and told me it was solid. Cheese pizza was on the menu so figure talk about the perfect timing. My first impression was kind of interesting set up cause really not much personality in the interior design. They do have one big widescreen hangs above the open kitchen area (if dine in can easily see anywhere), couple stand up chairs or lounge area (great spot if want see them do there magic making some pies, calzones, or whatever else on the menu), they had stand up refrigerator that they keep all the drinks (there nor fountain drinks it all by the can or bottle), and decent amount of seating for small restaurant. 

The cheese pizza got the large size to go. It was pretty good. Honest not much that goes into cheese pizza or ways that can mess it up. I have had bad ones just fyi. At Grinders the cheese pizza was solid. The crust was nice. It more think crust style pizza. The price you definitely get value for the size. 

The service was nothing but five stars. The gentlemen that took my order was friendly, positive vibes, and attentive. They also have free can of soda or drink that comes with check in. I found it little odd that he was like make good review..yay. It almost like they were not going honor the yelp check only if I do a review.

X09nma1Zb1CRccsyPWfAFw,BpROHEIsGBpCKUJrjAYZxA,SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg,5,1,0,0,"Going back through my recorded stays, I count seven over the past 1.5 years (one more coming in May!). It may not meet Malcolm Gladwell's 10k hour rule, but having spent nearly a month total on this property, I think I am at least somewhat qualified to offer a somewhat authoritative review of the place.

So, Aria. I love you. I really do. Why else would I come back so often? Why else would I shun your slightly prettier Mandarin neighbor? Well, the comp'd rooms, great casino, and spectacular dining do help.

Casino: Really, not gonna do much better on the non-kitschy higher end. I've spent far too many hours at the roulette table to count. I play for the fun and socializing (as non-poker/bj gambling should generally be approached) and there is not a more fun place among the higher end properties. I've taken spins with all kinds of characters from the shadowy to the overly exuberant - fun times through and through. I credit the Aria for creating this vibe and the croupiers and dealers (namely Mariya and some dude from Louisiana - Dave?) for enhancing these incredible times.

Hotel: Rooms are a huge draw. Keeping with the non-kitsch vibe, they are well-appointed and finished with all the essential features you'd expect from a five-star hotel. I usually get comp'd the standard or strip view rooms and see no good reason for paying hundreds+ for upgrades. The rooms are relatively spartan by non-gaming luxury hotel standards (see Mandarin), but this is by design as no casino wants guests feeling too comfortable in the rooms. The main draw of these rooms is that they are ""smart"", with bedside tablets the star of the show allowing guests to do everything from close the shades to order room service.

Pool: Did a cabana at the main pool on one stay and was mostly satisfied. Pretty sure the F+B for two came out over the cabana cost. It was a nice experience and would do it on occasion. They also have the more private Sky pool as well as a dayclub.

Restaurants: The collection of restaurants is hard to beat on the upper-mid to high-end price point and experience. I'll get some individual reviews up, but the one criticism I have is a lack of more casual and affordable choices. Yes, there is a small burger joint and a pizza place, but there still seems to be a hole in the true mid-tier dining option even at a luxury property (see Cosmo)

Parking/Bellman: Top notch. As with most places in Las Vegas, these guys and gals are often the standouts when it comes to service. Please show your appreciation.

Spa/Salon: Have done everything from eyebrow service to full hair and color. These ladies know what they are doing. While not a personal experience, my travel partner absolutely LOVES the barber on site: ""Luba is the best barber in the word. Do a shave.""

Gym: B+? Not exactly what you'd expect in terms of size from such a large, high-end property, but it has everything you need and is clean so that counts for something.

Concierge: Used a couple of times and was always satisfied with results - few dinner reservations and even recommendations on a place that does body piercing. The coolest part about the concierge is that you can text them. Now, this is not an overt case of shunning human interaction; rather, it goes along with their tech-driven ethos. Plus, the line at the concierge desk is often kinda long.

Rewards Program: I currently have Platinum status but probably won't after cycle end in October. Free valet, ""platinum experience"" at other MGM properties (think free entry to an exhibit), complimentary room upgrades (think mountain to strip view), extra points when gambling, priority room reservations, etc, etc, etc. Honestly, it's fine, but don't spend just to get status. Members can get various status levels (Pearl, Gold, Platinum) without gambling, as any MGM spend counts toward acquiring the necessary tier credits to advance.

Comps: Marketing: usually offered 2-4 nights at Aria and other MGM properties once every few months. Offers often include F+B credit which is just enough to ""cover"" the ever-bloating resort fee which you still have to pay even on comp offers. Casino comps are a little harder to come by as they are solely based on play. Given the type of money a property like Aria attracts, most people aren't going to be able to squeeze out more than a night or two. I was able to get free Killers concert tickets and one night comp'd, so I was happy with that.

Service: MGM is a huge publicly listed company, so it is not as personal of an experience as you'll get at some downtown or off-strip casinos. The staff is generally accommodating and friendly despite the clear corporate air, but there are times where the whole ""hands are tied"" excuse comes out in situations where staff at a smaller property could more easily accommodate.

Bottom Line: Aria, as long as you keep calling, I will continue to come, even if it means shunning the more robust offers from your MGM kin.",2018-04-04 17:27:56

I recently had some time to kill while waiting for an event to start here at the Mandalay Bay, this lounge sounded perfect to kill some time, plus find a snack and a drink! 

Orchids are an amazing and intriguingly beautiful flower. They symbolize prosperity and glory for many Asian cultures, but it's the beauty that draws my attention. It's all in the name behind my reasoning for stopping at this lounge. Orchids hold a special symbolism that grabs my fancy. 

As I approached the counter to take a gander at the menu I was not even given recognition by the ladies behind the counter. I thought this was highly unprofessional, but hey I was checking out their menu! Not a good way to greet the customer. Not at all! Well listen up it gets better! I allowed the ladies to finish their conversation, since I was not in any hurry today! If I was I would of left, period and given my business to some other establishment that would at least recognize my existence. 

When I finally was able to place my order it was smooth, but the employees kept talking and talking away. There talking does not bother me; in fact I love to watch a well oiled machine work together. That was not present here. The ladies behind the counter were neglecting their customers and talking about their lives and forgetting that they were at work. When I placed the order I had to repeat what I wanted at least three times. You might think I have the patience of Jobe, but not so! The visit here coincides when I was grieving the loss of my late husband. My mind was elsewhere, but it's just fine now!

When I got done with the order process the ladies put the order in a bag to go. I assume they do this for all of the customers since I was not asked if it was for here or to go! I ended up ordering a banana nut muffin and a chocolate croissant. To keep up my strength I eat a lot of fruit and veggies, a banana was my only fruit option I had that too. The ladies handed me the bag and I was off to my comfortable chair, but after getting settled I realized they gave my the wrong muffin and forgot the banana. I had to go back and explain this. It was exhausting, since I was given a look that intimated me by one of the ladies that served me. You know it I'm sure! I hate being accused of something, so I was polite and asked them to fix it. After talking to the other cashier they gave me the muffin I wanted and the banana. I do not want drama from those that take my order, so this experience I did not need. It happened so here it is in print. The reason for three stars is the awful experience that I had to go through. If the bar had not been open to make the Vodka Tonic it would of been lower; alcohol quelled that beast that rose due to the ignorance of the employees. 

After all the drama and I finally was able to sit and enjoy what I ordered it was smooth sailing. The banana nut muffin was amazing just the right balance between the nut and fruit! The chocolate croissant was acceptable, needed more chocolate but that's beside the point. The banana was delicious and hit the spot. 

The Orchid is convenient to the front of the Mandalay and has some of the best views while enjoying drinks or a small morsel. The prices reflect that of it being a tourist draw. Price was not my concern this trip. When I looked at the receipt for the food items I almost fell off my chair at the bananas price. Prepare yourself: ready the banana was $5.00. Damn right, for all the drama to enjoy it too! Way overpriced! Keep this in mind when ordering here. 

I would return here again but would air on the side of caution. Bring your own bananas, or you may not get it! He he lol! The drinks are made well although, but it's Vegas. What bar on the strip does not prepare good drinks? Right! When as a customer if I am treated where you don't matter it makes me feel unappreciated, so if I visit again it's still hard to answer this. Would I recommend? On a last resort, or only for the bar!

I must say, the restaurant itself was very cleaned when I walked in. I liked the look and the layout of the restaurants. The servers and cooks were very nice people, my boyfriend and I were well-welcomed. 
I got the combination (chicken, beef and shrimp) friend rice as an entree and three Chinese spring rolls as an appetizer. The spring rolls were freshly prepared and were delicious! What really got me was my entree! It was cooked to perfection in my opinion. With a few dash of soy sauce and some chili sauce, my entree was completed! 
My boyfriend ordered an entree of the kung pao chicken which was also tasty as described. The food if great! I love it! And the prices aren't too bad, that's a plus!

I would not have minded until I heard Whitney Houston's ""How would I know"".  I might be getting older but not that old.  We dressed up a bit and felt comfortable, but we noticed a few older couples from Iowa in their sweatshirts and jeans (they stood out in not a good way).

We ordered the $40 seafood platter that had 2 oysters, 2 prawns, 2 tuna & I think yellowtail. DELICIOUS! I enjoyed a White Orchid & a Cherry Cobler drink & my honey had the Cucumber drink (reminded me of being at a spa).

We ordered the 2lb lobster ($75 MP) & I had the Filet Medallion 7oz that was wonderful at $29 & my fiance had the 10oz Filet at $44.

The show has an 11 piece band that is quite good.  The 6 featured singers do a fantastic job singing the songs most of the audience knows so well.

The dancers are very good.  Girls in showgirl regalia bring back the days of a different Las Vegas when several casinos had showrooms with showgirls dressed and dancing to live bands, a time almost gone on the Strip.  The two tap dancers are incredibly talented.  

Put all of this together and you end up with a very enjoyable show that runs about 80 minutes.  The show is in the Saxe Theatre in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.  

I had a discounted ticket for the show.  The website says tickets run in the $90 range.  I'd recommend looking for a deal at a ticket outlet.

Nice lady who sits at the front very friendly asked me a few questions and rang me up! She already saw that I had my check-in for YELP ready! $7.77 please awesome! No problem. What I loved most about this place was they weren't pushy at all about offering any other kind of services. I can't tell you how many horror stories I've heard where people go in for one thing and then come out paying for extra stuff they never asked to be repaired!

Hour Hour - They have a menu for happy hour that includes drink specials for each day of the week such as $5 Martinis or vodka specials. They also have a food menu with appetizers like their garlic fries, seared ahi tuna, fish tacos and flat breads ranging anywhere from $4-$7. There are plenty of TVs to catch games however I've not witnessed volume for them. Happy hour is daily from 3pm-6:30pm and all day on Saturdays! They also offer it again for the late hours of 10pm - close. *only available in bar area (bar, booths, and high tops included)

Lunch - They do not offer a lunch special or half portions during lunch but it is a great place for business lunches. During the lunch hour it is mostly workplace professionals throughout the dinning and bar area. 

Dinner - Full menu offered including drinks. Reservations are not required nor usually needed. They can easily accommodate small and large groups. 

Group & Private Events - I've utilized their private room for two work events now l with group sizes ranging from 15-30. They provide a menu upon booking to order catering style. In the past we've done sliders, bruschetta, salad, pizzas and risotto appetizers bites. The room can be set up with long or round tables to accommodate the room along with linens.

Atmosphere is charming; they were playing 90s pop and hip-hop, fun classic group dancing songs, the lighting was nice.

Cons:
It was SO HOT. I learned about the no A/C deal the hard way.I drank quite a bit, but felt nothing at the end of the night, probably because I was sweating it all out.

However, as some others have stated, they have just become too big and corporate like for my taste.  In California there are lots of drive thru Starbucks so I kind of got spoiled getting coffee on my way to work or after dropping my daughter off at school.  When I moved to Arizona, I did not find the drive thru Starbucks to be the norm, rather I had to search to find one.  I did find one that was on my to work but the line was always super long.  So I did a search......and, behold, I found Dutch Brothers. 

On my first visit I was greeted enthusiastically by Heidi.  I told her it was my first visit and asked what she would reccomend.  She said her favorite was the Kahula Kicker.  I said, ""I'll give it a try"" and she promptly whipped one up for me.  She also gave me some stickers, two coupons, and a stamp card....buy 10, get one free!  Jackpot!  Starbucks doesn't do that, now do they?  That Kahula Kicker was very tasty too.  I'm not a fan of bitter coffee.  I like a smoother taste and yes, I like flavors in my coffee.  I could never drink it black.  Bleh!  Ducth Brothers coffee is smooth and I don't know how they do it, but it tastes creamy and that's a skinny Kahula Kicker too! That was just my first visit.....it's been two weeks now and I have to fight myself NOT to stop by on the way to work for my coffee.

The ingredients in the pho were alright I guess, they were pretty good, but the broth kind of killed the whole bowl.

The bun was absolutely terrible.  I don't know how they could have called it bun.  It tasted like spaghetti with candied pork and a bit of vegetables.  Not only that it was oily as hell,  I couldn't even help finish it at the end because the oil was so unpleasant.

If you look at the rest of the menu you can definitely tell that this place is totally influenced by chinese cuisine as there are sections that are just plain chinese noodles (ie. wonton noodle soup).

The food is spot on and service was great....SHort of it, for those not wanting to read the whole review - big patties that are juicy on a great bun.  No flat burgers!!!! So to break down

Atmosphere:  Chill, open and good outdoor seating.  The Cow mural is pretty rad in the background..  Bar is open to both inside and outside.  Hostess was not impressive, but then again it is the hostess ( sorry girls/boys its true)  I care more about the server

Server: Fantastic, I would have hired to anything customer service related, offered suggestions and even recommended something and had the chef make.

Food: menu straight forward burgers nothing funny.  The zucchini fries are great as well as there general fries.  I had the Zin burger and added mushrooms and switched out manchego to havarti.  Matthew had the breakfast burger which had a fried egg and avocado.  They offer shakes that sound great, but with a huge burger and fried I did pass.

The sole waiter was the Thai woman's husband who met her when he was abroad in the military back in the day, a grizzly old white guy who told horrible jokes.  The restaurant did very well despite the sometimes spotty closing hours.  Needless to say, my expectations for Thai food are very high.

I've been searching around different cities trying to find Thai food as good as the food from my first experience and have been disappointed until I tried Thai E-San.  I don't know what it is, but there's something special about the aftertaste at Thai E-San that sticks with you.  This is excellent Thai food.

We had the 3-star spicy Pa-Naeng Curry with Duck and the Red Curry with Shrimp.  Both were spectacular and had the perfect combination of spice and flavor.  Portions were big enough for at least two meals or for two people to share, which is how Thai food should be - it often taste even better the second day.  Although we did take-out, the service was very friendly, and the smell... the smell inside this restaurant made me want to sit down and just sniff.

I've definitely found my new Thai place.",2015-04-02 17:59:04

We've recently moved into Las Vegas and had dinner at this hotel's coffee shop a few weeks ago and was very impressed.  So, being a steak lover, I wanted to check this restaurant out.  We didn't realize it was so upscale (the casino is very casual) and were out shopping nearby, so it was a last minute idea to eat there.  We walked in just after 5pm on Sat, only a couple of table were occupied, so not having a reservation didn't seem to be an issue and we were seated right away.  The waiter explained the menu well and took our orders.  While waiting for our appetizers and bread to be served, the hostess seated a party of four right next to us (in what was basically an empty restaurant) -- the people had a small DOG with them.  I immediately looked at the hostess and said this would be a problem for me, and one of the 4 people quickly said ""it's a service dog"" (looked like a household pet to me).  I got up and said to my girlfriend, their table and the hostess ""We'll go to another restaurant"" -- no attempt was made to have us stay.  I've been eating in these types of restaurants for decades and never had dinner sitting next to a dog before anywhere (even at fast food places), it's too bad because I was hoping for a great, memorable meal -- of course at $80 a person, it should be great.",2014-12-01 01:08:54

On Saturday, I went up to spend the day with my favourite uptown family.  It was pre-decided that we would do peking duck night.  I obviously left restaurant choice to them, for a couple of reasons.  The first is because they are Taiwanese, and the second is because I trust them.  There's also the added buffer that the lady of the family feels the same way about Chinatown as I do, that is to say, we approach it with EXTREME caution, although in her case, she wouldn't approach at all.  

They took me to Chung King behind Pacific Mall in Market Village.  It's fairly unnoticeable, but for the line of people waiting.  We had reservations obviously, because the family knows to how to plan.  I love planners.

It seems this is the place to go for authentic Mandarin and Szechuan food, and more importantly, this is the place to get roasted duck.  As we sat at our table, I noted that server after server walked out with a duck, took it to a table where they were happily dismissed with a happy nod, wave or word.  He or she then promptly disappeared only to return with same duck, chopped up.  With each duck I saw, the more room I made in my stomach.  This was the first time I had peking duck where they bring the crispy little quacker out for me to see before I eat. 

We also ordered the Szechuan Beef - thin strip of crispy chewy beef with a kick - and the Birds Nest. Now I thought the latter was greasy seafood and broccoli in a deep fried chowmein bowl.  I would be wrong.  See, I come from a lone line of people who don't particularly like Chinese food (crazy right).  So if and when we ate it, it was usually mainstream and mainstream birds nest is just that.  My friend gasped when I told her and she simply said, ""that would be wrong"".  

It is actually a crispy bowl made out of deep fried potato shreds.  Huh?  The seafood and vegetable medley inside is garlicky, not greasy, and said medley includes bamboo, water chestnuts, carrots, etc.  Right sounds much more delicious now doesn't it.

It was a proper birds nest, and proper tastes good. 

We also had duck two ways (there is a third way - soup - but we decided to skip it).  The first option is the most common way to have peking duck.  The skin and slivers of meat are cut up and served with crêpes, hoisin, cucumbers, and scallions.  The second is also a wrap.  The rest of the meat from the ducks is diced and fried and served with lettuce cups.

Our duck was perfect - crispy, silky, meaty, fatty but not oily. 

It's about $40 for duck two-ways.  I'm pretty sure I could have eaten both ways by myself.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda...",2011-09-26 15:23:25

The waitresses were very nice and very accommodating in splitting bills, which sometimes doesn't happen at Chinese restaurants, so that was greatly appreciated.  

So for food/wait staff - I'd give it a 4/5.

However, I need to take it down by 0.5 star because the entrees came out very sporadically.  Out of 7 entrees we ordered, I think it took 45 minutes from the first to last dish, which is way too long.   I also have to take it down by another 0.5 star because it is 4.99 for a pot of tea and they don't refill it. For that price, it should be refilled.

Can i grab any beer i want in the fridge? Is there an upcharge for drinking it there?  Luckily, the dude i asked was cool and i didn't feel like a d-bag for too long. In my dream, it might have a larger space and comfier seating.

Additional awesomeness includes the fact that you can just get the beer from the fridge and they'll open it and provide a glass with no additional charge. The price of drinking at home, away from home. Also, an outdoor patio. 

Thai curried shitake and vegetable soup was wonderful and a large was like $3.29 ish. Don't pass it up if you like Thai flavor with a tad of spice.

Walked past Ferraro's, figured we'd give them a shot. Typically not a fan of Italian food, because, like Mexican food, it's basterdized and dumbed-down considerably in the interest of ignorance and economics. Very rarely do you find a place that actually makes authentic, no holds barred cuisine.

This is one of those places. It's a real old-school genuine Italian restaurant. Lot's of dark wood, low lighting, a menu with names I can't read and some very apropos live music in the bar area. If you're into wine, the list is phone book thick. We flipped through it just for fun, but seemed like lots of depth.

Absolutely outstanding service. Our waiter, Mike (who looked like a close cousin of Vin Diesel), was a true pro. He, along with his support staff in the dining room, were great. Drinks never ran dry, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and everyone seemed happy to be there. We do not have service this attentive and friendly very often.

Pretty big menu, much more than what I initially perused on their website. Daily specials sounded solid, and Mike was able to make some suggestions for me. Girlfriend had an outstanding ribeye, perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. I had some really great tortellini; very rich, great flavor and texture, perfect size portion. You can really tell that the pasta is made everyday in house. Best pasta dish I've had in years.

What sets a Pukka apart from the gang is that it showcases that Indian  food, albeit a bit bastardized, can be cooked with finesse . At most other Indian places the cooking very much follows the  'Wham bham, thank you Ma'am' school of thought!

It's a small bistro, and very popular with the locals so reservations are highly recommended. It's quite cramped and gets very loud very fast.

We started with vegetable fritters and monk fish. The fritters were crisp to a fault, a bit too crisp, but because of the carom seeds set themselves apart from the fritters I've had at other Indian places.

The monk fish was very tender but the sambal was way too acidic for my taste and imho overpowered the fish.

The fiddle heads with paneer was a refreshingly unique pairing and it tasted very home cooked. In hindsight the crunch of the ginger was actually quite ok. Biting into the cardamom shells wasn't pleasant on the other hand.

We also got the boatman's curry which definitely felt like going through an ocean of curry, deliciously yet subtly coconutty. The pieces of fish in the curry were ample and worth fishing for!

The rice was delcious: fluffy and slightly scented with rose water and saffron.

They turned an unassuming, regular house on Willy St. into a stylish, modern, roomy restaurant. I felt really good being in the restaurant. As the owner described - they wanted you to feel like you're not in Madison anymore.

Cocktails: The cocktail craze has caught on and it seems like every restaurant is upping their game, with the unfortunate side effect of driving up drink prices.Their cocktail menu is diverse and creative with prices ($6-7) that are fair. I only tried two, and they both were yummy. The sake seems fairly solid, but I don't know what I'm talking about.

Food: Overall very good. The taco-style bbq pork buns were neat and tasty. The pickled veggies were good, but a small portion. The dumplings were top notch. The sauces were decent, could use a bit more pow. The ramen needs some work - I know they can do better. Mix in's and more diverse flavors would be a good start. The green tea brulee was a pleasant surprise.

Overall - I can't wait to go again. The owners seem passionate and have some good ideas for improving, like a patio for summer and a late night pork-only menu (sorry veggies!).",2011-03-20 22:05:25

Despite returning home from a late lunch given we were in the area so decided to give this homage to Canadiana our support ;)

What we had 
Mussels 
Pigeon Pie 
Okanagan Pinot

Overall food, ambience, value, service: 3.5/5

The dishes were nice but didn't feel compelled to try anymore. As others have pointed out given it is Canadiana the paucity of options for Canadian wines by the glass is strange. But a cursory glance seemed to indicate the same trend for bottles as well. I believe the truly hidden gem that is Hart House Gallery Grill (haunt of Queen's Parkers & UofT top brass) in Toronto has at least an equally interesting selection of Cdn inspired dishes and vino :)

Came here before clubbing at Marquee just to satisfied that ""I need to put some food in my stomach so, I don't pass out drunk at the club"" needs.

This is a spot where it's best to come in big groups so, you can pretty much samps everything on the menu. Ordered appetizers: lobster corndogs, truffle mac & cheese, street tacos, urth burger, and the kalbi and kim chee quesadillas.

The street tacos had to be my favorite. There was duck in there (I love duck!). There was foie gras (Who doesn't love foie gras!?). Reminded me a lot of the Kogi food truck out in LA.
The lobster corndogs were interesting. Not a seafood kinda gal but, it tasted like butter because of the lobster and yet, kinda weird cuz it's in a corndog kind of batter.
Truffle mac and cheese was amazing. I think there was shrimp in there cuz it tasted of seafood. A friend ordered it so, I got to samps some. The weird part of this dish was it came with a small sandwich. I'm not sure what kinda of sandwich but, when I say ""small,"" - I mean, small....like, ""one bite and you're done with your sandwich small.""
The kalbi and kim chee quesadillas were pretty good but, seemed too salty. I'm not sure why.

I ordered the Shio Ramen. Unlike Kinton, you don't get to choose how heavy your soup base was, but they made it just right. It's much lighter than Kinton's soup. The black oil they added gave the ramen an unusual charcoal taste which I quickly grew to enjoy. The portions are fitting for a small girl like myself.

We also ordered the fried chicken which was just average. There were 2 pieces served on a small plate (with a piece of lemon). The skin was kind of crispy, but that's about it.

Over the weekend, I opened my water bill & it was 5 times the amount of what it usually is for this time of the year; almost $500!!! So I knew there was a problem.  I scheduled service through my home warranty company & Ideal services is the company they subcontract out to.  So the technician comes over and it was explained to him that there was probably a leak somewhere, due to the water bill and the arrow on our meter spinning like crazy (with no water running).  The technician does his thing and claims there is a leak somewhere in an underground pipe running from the street, along our driveway & under the garage.

He explained that our warranty did not cover what needed to be done (i.e. Digging up the rock or slab to fix the broken pipe).  The technician said he could still fix the problem even if not covered for approximately $2800-$3200 (holy crap!!!).  So, I was a little skeptical because this is my 3rd warranty company because the others were crap & untrustworthy.  

Going with my gut, I called for another plumber to come over for a second opinion.  Within 5 minutes, the plumber located the problem... It was a running toilet upstairs in the spare bedroom.  The toilet has been broken & I heard water draining there the last couple of days, so this made sense.  $70 later, he fixed the toilet and, thereby, fixed the problem.  I looked at the meter and the arrow stopped spinning.  

Thank goodness I got a second opinion.  I could have told the first technician to go ahead with tearing up my property to locate the 'alleged' water leak by my driveway.  Unbelievable!!!! And that would still have left the problem of the toilet.  I couldn't imagine this guy doing this to an elderly person who doesn't know any better.  I almost threw $3000 down the toilet!!!

Getting up to the top of the Stratosphere can be hassle free when you go grab a drink at Level 107. This is a cool little cocktail lounge that has some of the best views you can find anywhere. Being at the Stratosphere has its pros and cons. The major pro obviously being you have a stunning view of Las Vegas. The major con being you are still at the Stratosphere. While they have ""renovated"" the Stratosphere, it hasn't fixed the crowds that it attracts, nor the neighborhood that surrounds it. It also doesn't change the fact that it is in a bit of an awkward place between the main strip and downtown Vegas. But, all things considered, Level 107 lounge is a huge bonus and a reason to visit the Stratosphere.
We had a few drinks that were very good and enjoyed the views. We took a look at the menu but had already eaten so decided to stick to drinks. The menu was nice and had some good options for a small lounge. The bartenders were friendly and talked to us while making our drinks.
The one downfall for me was the kind of awkward layout of the lounge due to its location. Obviously in a building like that, there is only so much space you have to work with so I understand the challenge there.
From reading other reviews it seems I need to try the chocolate martini the next time I'm there. I will be using this as another awesome place to take people visiting from out of town!",2012-03-31 06:15:20

It was pretty empty inside. A guy comes and delivers water and then we wait. And wait. And wait. Finally about 10 minutes later our waitress comes by with straws and asks if we're ready to order. 

J's order - Monte Cristo 
C's order - a kids slider
Mine - buffalo chicken sandwich
App - Holy Pierogi

Now never having pierogis before, i can't say if these were good or not. But first impression, not ordering again.  Pretty much bland mashed potatoes in a dumping.

The Monte Cristo was greasy and very cloying. No balance of sweet and savory. Like ordering diabetes for dinner. J ended up only eating half of a half and was done. The manager did replace it with a hot pastrami, which J said was excellent and he should have ordered originally.

The kids slider - the waitress didn't ask what type of slider and C was automatically given the Jewish slider. He ate the slice of brisket off the slider and the fries. 

My buffalo chicken sandwich. Not as described on the menu. A piece of grilled chicken, not fried, so huge that it was 2x the size of the bun. The chicken must have had sauce dumped over it because it was so sopping wet the bottom bun disintegrated into a mushy mess before I even took a bite. And the blue cheese was missing. I ended up eating a few bites and had had enough. 

Service at the table was lack luster. Took 20 minutes to get the check. And the manager seemed irritated that we didn't like the food. 

Oh and apparently dinner time is the perfect time for doing maintenance in the restroom. Going to take C to the potty, i had to ask the 2 workers to leave. Then returning later to use the facilities myself, i again had to ask them to leave. So forget trying to wash your hands properly. Unless i wanted to hopscotch over the materials/supplies.

I will say the counter/bakery guy was outstanding. His customer service - A+
Counter purchases - 
Cheesecake - Fabulous. Nice texture and not overly sweet
Alligator - Fantastic. If a bear claw and baklava had a baby, it would be an alligator!",2015-04-29 03:45:05

As I'm walking back home for dinner I smell fried chicken.  Wait, this is NOT your regular KFC, it has Chinese characters written all over it.  It reads ""big big Chicken rib"" umm ok, chicken usually not known for their ribs. So I went in to see what they have.

Looking over the menu, I ended up order the original fried chicken breast! And oh my, they aren't kidding. This break is large! I can easily put both my hands together and it's not as big as the piece of chicken breast.  

It was super fresh! You can get it with no spice or mild, medium or hot. If you are into chicken, you gotta try it out. The spices on it is blend'ish, but it's refreshing from the salty KFCs out there!

amRw-ptSmvGuDDZxO-LNuQ,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg,5,3,2,3,"Full review in the blog, simply not enough room to express my praises here:

...how do you begin to describe a meal at Kai - the only Forbes 5-Diamond restaurant in Arizona and perhaps the only ""fine dining exploration of Native American Culture"" in the world?  Would it be easiest to discuss it as a ""resort restaurant"" where the meal is begun with an offering of citrus selections for the water and silverware is presented temperature appropriate?  Would it make sense to talk about the culinary pedigree of head Chef Michael O'Dowd and his heavy reliance on refined French technique to display the beauty of rarely utilized locally farmed ingredients?  Or perhaps I should start off in the manner that a meal at Kai begins - with a lengthy and informative story about the location, tribe, and inspirations of the meal that will follow.  In reality I think any of the above would be appropriate, but in the end I think the best way to begin is in the mindset of a ""destination"" meal because from start to finish that is precisely what Kai is.

The second course of my meal at Kai would prove to be the single best thing I ate during my visit to the desert - a plate where nearly everything screamed ""heavy and overly complicated"" but a dish where each element added something to the whole with the resultant product even greater than the sum of its parts.  Entitled ""Escargot, Truffles, Wild Mushrooms & Caramel Goat Cheese"" this lovely presentation arrived with a piece of slightly sweetened Native ""French Toast"" at one end and a stew of Burgundy snails, Oregon truffles, and pork belly nuggets at the other.  Teaming with notes of Meyer lemon and black garlic nage plus the sweet acidity of blis vinegar the dish was finally topped tableside with a slowly melting frozen Truffle Crema and dots of Tarragon Oil and Chive Oil that added an aromatic tinge both earthy and herbal that rose to the palate and sinuses melding all the flavors into a truly magnificent dish.

Another highlight reel dish and served at the size of its full a la carte portion the ""Prairie Squab & Spiced Cornmeal Dusted Sweetbreads"" would be quite the generous offering.  Beginning first with the scarlet squab featuring a flawless sear and the hockey-puck sized sweetbread, crispy on the outside and creamy within, both of the proteins on this plate would prove exemplary.  Moving next to the accoutrements - beneath the squab a round of truffled Iberico Lomo Gratinee Potatoes plus Wilted Summer Chard Leaves and under the thymus a dollop of stone fruit & grape Chutney with Truffle Croutons -one sweet and one savory once again, and both complimentary to their respective proteins without being overwhelming.

mMy final dessert would arrive in the hands of a back-server along with a warning of ""be careful, this is very hot"" and indeed it was, the Mexican Chocolate Souffle's ramekin radiating a palpable heat at easily a two foot distance.  Large, tall, proper, and aromatic with notes of cocoa and ""Kai's Sweetened Dry Mole Spices"" the soufflé was subsequently punctured tableside with the addition of a thick and smoky Wattleseed Anglaise and without hesitation I can say that although non-traditional in texture the flavor was outstanding...a sweet meets savory brownie with notes of cinnamon, cumin, pepper, and clove punctuating the chocolate and melding with the Anglaise.  Like the cheesecake this is the sort of dessert I imagined when I requested its addition to my menu and I'd encourage any and all to do the same.

No stranger to fine dining whether stateside or in Paris I will simply state that although some may not appreciate ""resort"" restaurants or the somewhat longwinded ostentatiousness of Kai's presentations there is not a doubt in my mind that this is a restaurant deserving of its 5-star accolades and the sort of restaurant that would invariably garner at least two if not three Michelin Stars if the Red Guide ever came to town.  A refined experience with an exquisitely talented chef preparing ingredients both common and unique in ways that are novel even to the experience diner Kai is not just a restaurant, but truly the exploration of native and local flavors that it sets out to be.",2011-10-28 02:33:40

They get pissed if you work out with anyone because there is no ""personal training"" (I guess talking to my brother every once in a while at the gym is personal training)........unless of course you buy it from them. 

The sauna only worked about half the time.

The music was freaking horrible and so damn loud.

I paid cash in advance for a year so I wouldn't have to give them cc info but even that was a joke.

I SHOULD have written this review right after our date....but better late than never, huh? Anywho.......we ordered a great Mt Veeder wine....nothing better than Napa Cabernet on a first date, right? Our waitress was fantastic, and made some great recommendations, like the Boss and Blackened Tuna Rolls. Both were excellent! This is where I noticed the connection to Cowfish....sushi rolls but not quite ordinary sushi rolls.....We got the Mongolian beef as well. Not quite as good as PF Changs MB but very tasty.

No first date would be complete without flowers, and Michelle was blown away by them. I mean, guys don't bring flowers on first dates anymore? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? Well I DO! So there!

Anyway, a really great vibe here and I can see why it's so popular in this area! When I'm back up this way I will definitely stop back to try their many other dishes!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",2015-04-29 00:40:33

Not only were they delish they were a great price too!  $8.50 for half a dozen is a pretty good price to me :) I got there at 9:45 on a Saturday and unfortunately all the donuts I have been wanting to try (that I have seen on social media) were all gone.  I live in downtown Cleveland so it's a little bit of a drive for me so I guess I'll have to set an alarm super early next time!  
The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because none of the donuts are labeled.  It was super busy in there and the girl working seemed annoyed with me because I had to ask what flavor each donut was.  I actually felt like I didn't even get donuts I really wanted because of this.  I felt rushed and frustrated so I just hurried up and picked 6 because I felt so uncomfortable and didn't want to hold up the line.  
I really hope they start to label the donuts here because if so this place would be 5 stars in my book!",2017-04-19 22:11:50

I ordered a 2 meat combo...pulled pork and hot link. Now I will give credit where credit is due....the meat and flavor was good....the sauce was good too..had a little kick to it.

Love this Trader Joe's almost as much as I loved the one I shopped in Green Valley, just off of Coronado and Eastern, I believe?

The store is pretty neat and organized, but I have noticed they have a tendency to move things around in the frozen food section and that tends to become a little annoying. The vegetarian selection here is pretty decent and the prices can't be beat. A lot cheaper than you'd find in a traditional grocery store. 

The staff here is awesome. Always asking if I need any help as I shop and the checkers are always friendly. Sparking up a conversation and recommending products. Yeah, all Trader Joe's do that, I know, but I like it. And it always seems like I meet a new checker that's vegetarian, so that makes the food conversations that much more enjoyable.

Based on Yelp reviews, my SO and I went out for our first Italian restaurant dinner that wasn't wood-fired pizza in YEARS. 
Sure, I order italian style food at French restaurants, but a honest-to-goodness Italian resto hasn't been of interest. I can make pasta at home any day. 
The service was 10 star worthy, making sure every detail was perfect, despite our ""wine by the glass"" type of night vs the huge table of big-tipping Italian men. 
For starters, I got a half portion of gnocci in gargonzola sauce and the toothiness was perfect. There is not a doubt that it was made within the day.  
The specials of the evening were a whole fish, deboned table-side or a poached fish. So as not to offend the non-fish eater, I got the poached whitefish.  My French is good enough to know that Beurre Blanc sauce and what the fish was poached in means butter! 
Between that and the amazing bread basket with butter I probably ate a whole stick.

The museum is located downtown, a block off of Fremont street near The Grand hotel. Parking is VERY scarce so we parked in the huge lot at Main Street Station which is very close by and only $5 (they will validate if you grab a meal).  

The day we went the museum was really, really crowded, so it was a little difficult to spend a lot of time looking at all of the displays. However, the displays themselves are extremely well put together and very interesting and informative. This is a really nicely put together and maintained museum. The tour is self guided and you can pay a little extra for an audio tour.  Oh, and since it's Vegas, you can buy a drink and carry it with you through the tour. 

You'll learn all about the Mob and organized crime from bootlegging in the early 1900's to outlaw biker gangs today. They cover it all and that was a nice surprise because for some reason I expected to only hear about the Vegas mob, and that's not the case. 

The tour takes a few hours if you really want to read and look at everything on all three floors of the building. But if you're in a hurry, or don't like crowds, you can skim and do it quicker. Regardless, it's a good time and well worth the price.",2017-02-19 19:23:31

There was a total of 7 of us, including Mr. Riches.  The tasting menu consisted of a 6 course meal with some highs and some lows.

The Lows:
- The Sea Bass was very dry and rubbery.  Nobody at the table who had it enjoyed it.  When the waiter asked how it was, one diner said, ""I'll be honest with you. It's not very good.""  The waiter just didn't say anything as he cleared the plate.
- The Caviar - I'm not a huge fan of smoked salmon.  This dish is probably just a personal preference issue

The Highs:
- The kobe steak was the best part of the meal.  Well flavored and cooked great.
- The Lobster Pot Pie had a lot of lobster and was delicious.

I was also quite surprised that there was not any amuse buche with the meal.  Nor, were there any small chocolates or jellies at  the end.

You order by the pound of what you'd like and they only offer seasonal catches. I believe it was the lobster and/or crawfish that wasn't in stock because theyre not in season right now so they didn't have it. I also believe the prices change depending which time of the season they're caught in too. The 3 that are seasonal prices are Dungeness Crab, Lobster, and Crawfish.

They have about 6 flavours; Szechuan, Cajun, Garlic Butter, Curry, Lemon Pepper, and the Good Catch House Blend. You can also choose how spicy you'd like it ranging from Mild, Medium, Mad, and Suicide. The Garlic Butter however comes by default not spicy. You can also add sides like potatoes, corn, okra, brussel sprouts and more. 

My friend ordered a pound of shrimp for $13 in Cajun Medium spice. There ws a decent amount of flavour I have to admit but I would've preferred to order Szechuan or Lemon Pepper for the shrimp. The Medium spicy was barely spicy for mr but maybe that's because I have high spice tolerance? Definately next time will order the Mad or Suicide Spicy.

Everything comes with a metal pail, a plastic bib, high quality plastic gloves and lots of napkins!

I ordered the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries (extra $) which I thought was heavenly. The sauce paired with the crispy and savoury crab topped with mango salsa was out of this world. I tried really hard to not inhale this sandwich and to savour the orgasmic flavours as much as I could. The sweet potato fries were so crispy and delicately sweet and the refreshingly sour salad tied everything together like a harmonious symphony.

The cheese was thin crust and maybe the winner of the night for just a solid, good, perfectly cooked pie! The Sicilian was very good as well, with a good deep dish dough and miniature pepperonis! You can get a large variety of pizza styles here ranging from Chicago deep dish, to New York thin crust, and more creative gourmet styles! My one knock on this place is that it is way over priced! In Vegas where there are a few great pizza joints, with Vegas style prices, this place definitely hits the high mark with our three pies and sodas topping the $100 plateau! This southern gentleman enjoyed his meal, loved the decor of the restaurant, loved the proximity to Fremont, but probably wouldn't come back due to the extreme prices! At the same time I certainly would encourage you to try it out as it is a tasty pie!",2015-08-31 13:57:00

We came here last night for Winterlicious. We were seated right away in a nice spot. A server came by to pour two of our waters and left. She didn't come back until our third guest arrived. After he had his water poured, we didn't see the server come to our table for about 15 minutes. It was fine - we were all in deep conversation but just a little surprised that you wouldn't follow up for that long. I would at least check in to see if the table was ready etc. Didn't get that.

When she came back we asked her what she recommended for the appetizer. She seemed kind of confused and asked us what we wanted to know. Thought that was funny, we obviously want her recommendation on what's good. Anyways she said she liked the hamachi poke or the pork bao. Our group ordered both. Friend had the bao - pork was a little dry but the flavour was there. The hamachi poke - had a lot of sesame oil. It was good but the tuna just wasn't there for me. Not overly impressed.

Our main dish, friend ordered the snapper - he said was it was good. My other friend and I ordered the fried chicken and ribs. I thought this dish was nice looking and very full. The fries and chipotle mayo were delicious but I wasn't overly impressed with the ribs and fried chicken itself. I thought the fried chicken lacked flavour surprisingly hence why I gave this restaurant 3/5.

The desserts were great. We each tried the carrot cake, dulce de leche ice cream with caramel corn and apple crisp. The apple crisp was our favourite. It was nice and crisp and the  vanilla ice cream paired well with it. Can't go wrong with vanilla ice cream and apple pie :)

I'd like to give this restaurant another try since it seems like the average rating is pretty good but I'm not sure I will based on this experience. The ambiance is really nice which wants to pull me back. Maybe it was a one off because of Winterlicious, but I expected more.",2016-02-12 14:16:09

I have never shown up for any special event, only for the curry, pad thai and stuffed wings (of which i have had much better) .. but the little older man that sits at the the karaoke stage and sings Lionel Richie and Commodore's covers .. in Thai... is a nice touch ; ]

My mood is sour since my entire post got deleted in one button, seriously what is wrong? The guy manning the coat check area should be an actor, and I mean in A+ films.

I think I was very lucky or that Nota Bene was THAT GOOD. The clam chowder was a surprise since it didn't come out chunky and thick - on the contrary it's super smooth and presents like a broth. Even though we are drinking something that isn't pureed, all the flavours are present and it was excellent. The entree was HEAVEN. The table beside us ordered the same dish and devoured everything, leaving only bits behind. This is SERIOUSLY one of the best pastas I've had (the bolognese, which I don't see on the menu anymore!). Super moist pasta (not to mention smooth and thin), sauce is on point, the meat was super yummy, and it was damn filling. I can't describe to you how amazing this dish was. Go ahead, order it and disagree with me. I was quite worried that the dessert would disappoint but holy cow it surpassed my expectations. The crunchiness of the apple crumble - YES! Most Winterlicious meals leave me regretting I ever spent $45 or whatever but Nota Bene won me over.

Today, after working nights all week, my husband finally got to take a look at his truck and had found that Moonlight Car Wash had broken the sun shade! 

I was really upset because I have only ever driven his truck 3 times, (including taking it to the carwash) in the 3 years that we've had it - so I don't know much about the truck - and I just wish they would have told me! I was really mad. WAY mad. It's a good thing that I had a cooling down period because I was stunned with how unprofessional a business could be; break something and then just sweep it under the rug; um NO.

Anyway, my husband and I returned to Moonlight today to let the owner know what had happened at his carwash and also how the wax job was swirly and there was still wax just hanging on in certain places that it shouldn't be. Immediately we were taken care of. The young man who directed me through the carwash in the first place spoke with the manager and we worked out something that both parties could be pleased with.

They re-buffed my husbands truck and re-wiped it down so NOW, it REALLY SHINES. I was mad that they hadn't told me upfront about the damage to the sunshade but the fact that they jumped on the problem and just fixed it, redeemed them in my eyes.

To my surprise, this place was packed with neighborhood peeps standing in line for their coffee and breakfast sandwiches/pastries.  I decided to join in on the fun.

The good thing about long lines is that it gives you plenty of time to figure out what you want to order.  I decided on a ham, egg and cheese on a croissant.  The sandwich was huge and yes, I ate the whole thing.  It was really good, but I am pretty sure they are using imitation eggs and I would have preferred real eggs.  I ordered a regular coffee, which was good and did the job.  I sipped on my beverage while I waited a whopping 15 minutes for my food.  They warned me when I got to the register, so it wasn't a shock when I decided to place my order.

Here's what I'm ordering next time.  For sure, I'm getting one of their pastries.  They looked amazing and there was this blueberry treat that someone was eating at the table next to me...I was so close to just tearing off a piece to try, but thanks self control.

The last time we visited this location our experience wasn't that great (2 stars). This time it improved greatly. The dining room, although packed thanks to many families from C's school was clean. I saw 2 employees moving about inside and outside cleaning tables. Nice. The line was long but as with every time I've visited any Chipotle, it moves fast enough.
C ordered his usual, Steak Burrito with nothing in it but cheese. The burrito came out much bigger than last time which was good to see. C said the burrito was very tasty and he only found a couple pieces of meat which he thought were a bit ""grissly"" There was still a really good portion of beef and a nice handful size pile of cheese. As C's burrito was being prepared I asked the guy behind the glass about the whole ""Steak 3 Pointer"" thing. He told me that since this burrito really has nothing on it but the meat and cheese, it costs less than a regular steak burrito, $5.75, and they call it a ""Steak 3 Pointer"". Ah, thanks for the clarification.
I ordered the Barbacoa bowl. Yummy seasoned beef which was tender and juicy. Then I added fresh shredded cheese, fresh tomato salsa, roasted chile-corn salsa, lettuce and sour cream. All this on top of a nice pile of brown rice. Winner winner Barbacoa bowl dinner.
Because this was a fundraiser, C and I also ordered some chips and Guacamole ($3.25). Certainly not the best deal in town but the guac tasted good and the chips were not overly salty so pretty good all around.

The newest parts of the zoo were nice. I mainly went to see the new tiger exhibit. I saw two tigers, which at the time were mostly stationary. But there is a very spacious area for the tigers including it looked like an overhead walkway for the tigers. 

Perhaps more than that I liked the giraffe area. There is a very cool observation platform that put my 6' tall self basically eye to eye with the giraffes. For $2 you can get some lettuce to feed them. 

The final highlight was the elephant enclosure. I was a bit disappointed with the thickness of the landscaping separating the enclosure and the viewing areas. I vaguely remember there being less of it pre-remodel. In any event the area was nicely done and a large improvement over the former space. 

All in all I was left hoping for a bit more value out of the experience. I definitely think there is room for progress with the space available to the zoo. Perhaps a combination of more exhibits, more signage and more value added experiences will make the zoo even better in the future. For what it's worth, at various exhibits there were zookeepers with skeletons and other hands on exhibits on carts that might have interested kids. 

The zoo was very clean. The landscaping and exhibits were well maintained. There were tram routes to get you to the far flung areas of the zoo, including from the parking lot. There was an (over) abundance of fast food type places to get food throughout the zoo and plenty of seating. 

I want to revisit and try the Inside Tracks behind the scenes experience ($50) and see if that adds any value for the adult visitor.

As for the separate rainforest, the space is very small. You can walk through in under an hour for sure.

It's also a good place to get takeout if you don't feel like cooking.  The burgers are always good, and the quesadilla is really good if ordered without the sweet BBQ sauce.

I recently discovered the basement area of this Great Dane location. It has a really cool atmosphere...kind of has a Prohibition era feel to it.  It's a nice place to sit and have drinks, and the bartender was very friendly and helpful.

SpVl8t2sTWucPYH4XxriXQ,pNzFq2QcLNV_zBRkemeRsg,Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ,2,1,1,0,"I used to love this place.  Their happy hour was fabulous (half price apps!) and the shrimp scampi pizza was scrum-diddly.  I would come in for a sandwich at lunch.  All of my favorite things dishes have been altered or removed on the new menu, which is just bad luck on my end of course.  I totally respect the Green/organic and GF direction, but I feel that the changes were a bit too drastic, leaving my mainstream palate feeling alienated.

Came in for the new happy hour, was truly bummed out, since it used to be so good.  Could have understood the narrowing of options, and offering five dollar plates instead of full sizes at half-price, but the new recipes tasted plain awful, and I felt a bit screwed.

First: meatball sliders, served with avocado, Roma tomato, and a basil leaf I believe.  Sounds good, right?  In reality, a real bitch-kitty to consume.  Flimsy bread that disintegrated under the weight of a whole, lukewarm, dry, and practically flavorless meatball, combined with a *wedge* of avocado  - turned what is meant to be a finger food into a fork and knife affair.  The whole thing just fell apart after the first bite, and was tasteless to boot.

Pesto bread: the pesto soaked in to the bread in an unattractive way and was (again) bland, cheese was rubbery in the extreme.  And again on the GF bread, with no apparent options for something else.  I'm sure that it tastes awesome to someone who shits liquid for days after eating the regular stuff, I respect that.  But for me, blech.  Just give the option, please, don't force feed me the compressed crumbs bread.  Had I known better, I would have ordered it on foccacia.  Wish I had been given the choice on the happy hour menu.

Then, the stuffed peppers.  Wish I had known they were SO spicy and SO acidic, my palate was blown out with the first bite, glad it didn't precede anything else, or I wouldn't have tasted the rest of the meal.

Thankfully, the salads are still YUM and would be what I order if I ever return, since I am not a big pasta fan.  My favorite pizza, the shrimp scampi, is now neopolitan style.  Meh, no thanks.  And in my mourning, I don't want to try any others.  ;) Fickle, I know.

Decor is looking a bit matronly at this location.  I always remember the Flagstaff location being much brighter, airier.  This one feels...lackluster.      They obviously had to make some sacrifices in layout due to the size of the space, and as mentioned elsewhere, it feels a bit odd, even dowdy.

The feeling emanates from the staff as well.  All skilled, polite, and hardworking, don't get me wrong, but not lively at all.  Service is efficient, but not engaging, at least not for me.  GM is nice and gets the job done well, but always seems stressed.  

One thing that put me off on my last visit - I mentioned my disappointment at the disappearance of the chalk-board happy hour, including $5 martini Thursdays, and my server's tone was borderline rude in replying.  She treated me like a rube, which I don't appreciate.  They had a good value for the guest and they took it away, probably because it wasn't making them any money, I get that and respect their change in direction.  But don't be rude to a semi-regular who is inquiring nicely.  Just smile and shrug, point out the new stuff, don't act like I am a chinz for asking.

I guess this just isn't my kind of place anymore.  The happy hour was really what brought me back and it is boring and flavorless now.  The organic thing is awesome, guys, but it still has to taste good!  

They are catering to a niche market, I hope this suburb can support the location.  I love local businesses and hope they succeed.  Good luck and farewell, Picazzo's.",2011-08-25 04:05:47

While I'm quite sure that NOBODY in this place is from my political side of the aisle, this IS a cool place to enjoy some beer or wine on the patio, and enjoy a deli sandwich (during the day anyway).

As ""the Wineguy,"" I was shocked to see many Oregon Pinot Noirs, some ""boutique"" Zinfandels, and even a Beaujolais Blanc! Not exactly a common wine....but apparently it is in the COMMON market!

Now for those of you in my age bracket (yes I'm old), this is how Coke USED to make their product....with CANE sugar! Now they use High Fructose Corn Syrup which while not bad (and CERTAINLY better than that sweet a$$ Pepsi), pure cane sugar ROCKS! So I bought both and there IS a taste difference!

I'm generally not a fan of sweet and salty mixed and have even had other maple bacon donuts previously that I wasn't a fan of, but this one was great! The bacon was already sweet with brown sugar, and the maple syrup wasn't too overpoweringly sweet on top of that, so everything worked together well. I'm also not a fan of yeast donuts, but these weren't too soft and airy like some yeast iterations, and were quite tasty.

I have frequented many festivals and LIB is by far my favorite for multiple reasons: great music, amazing art, loads of tasty food, in an out privileges, and multiple bathroom locations. Yup bathroom locations made this list. This can sometimes be often overlooked, but it is an important must have for festivals. 

If you haven't been to Life Is Beautiful is takes place all over downtown Las Vegas. From Fremont Street all the way past the old Western Hotel and Atomic Bar & Liquor Store. This also includes Container Park which closes for the weekend and is only accessible once you're inside the festival grounds. Throughout the streets there are multiple art displays, interactive features, and around every corner there's either a food spot or beer vendor. Although food and drinks tended to be a little on the pricey side, with the awesome in and out privileges, you could go to any one of the many bars or restaurants that surround the venue and not have to pay top dollar for a grilled cheese or Heineken. 

Parking was never a factor and the grounds themselves never felt crowded, that ""cattle herding"" felling never came over me once. The grounds were mapped out perfectly with multiple pathways leading to the same destinations. Along most of these paths were giant painted wall murals or pieces of 3-D Art that stopped you in your tracks and made for sweet photo ops. As corny as this sounds, I think these pieces of art and the constant reminder that, ""You Are Beautiful"" kept everyone in high sprits with smiles and random high fives. The, ""bro-factor"" was kept at bay and I never once witnessed a fight or festival goers acting like over-privileged jerk offs.

The music was on point and every band seemed to be feeding off the ""beautiful"" vibe that the crowd was putting out. Every band I stayed to watch gave nothing but praise to the Vegas crowds. Some of my personal favorites of the weekend were Alt-J and The Arctic Monkeys. I hate to say this but, Outkast was pretty boring (I'm probably going to get some hate on that comment). Artist I'm bummed I missed were Phantogram, Broken Bells, and Girl Talk.

I heard the Chef stages in Container Park were amazing, but sadly I never had a chance to check them out; there was just simply too many things to do. That might be my one beef... Too many fun things to do or at least try to do over the course of three days.

The half and half wings were my favorite. Both flavors were equally good. The wings are ginormous and had a thick, flavorful, crispy coating. The spicy wings were barely spicy, and I have a pretty low heat tolerance. I also recommend the choiang brocolli, which also says spicy on the menu but is not at all.

The crispy pork belly was ok, just VERY crispy, almost to the point where it was hard to chew. It comes with a really good sauce and I'd recommend ordering the bao buns to go with it. 

The ambiance is pretty modern/rustic which I enjoyed a lot. The food is expensive though, definitely more than I was expecting.",2017-01-03 16:28:36
GN0YeKVJbMSVvuvqQ1Tg3Q,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,w4a6TuFWArSc29dB51rPNA,3,3,1,3,"I'm not a drinker and as such I don't go to bars - ever.  After a long day checking out the CIA's BFA exhibit with my little sister we decided to hit the West Side Market and after picking up some cupcakes from Grandma Freda's decided that some proper food would be ideal before digging into the cupcakes (for the sake of full disclosure I'll admit I ate the Red Velvet before dinner.)  Having heard great things about Michael Nowak's inventive cuisine and high end ingredients I'll admit I was curious about Bar Cento before even going to Cleveland for the day and the fact that they had an extensive list of unique beers certainly appealed to my sister.

Entering the surprisingly larger front-patio area we were greeted by a friendly hostess who asked us whether we would prefer the (loud!) outside area or the more subdued interior - given the fact that techno-esque music blared outside and I heard Pearl Jam's Black playing inside we opted for the indoors -  a great choice as we were treated to Zeppelin, the Doors, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam throughout our meal.   

Comfortably seated at a small table near the bar we browsed the menu (myself the food and my sister the beer) and chatted while our quirky server buzzed around the restaurant replacing silverware on tables, placing bread baskets with olive oil (which we notably never received,) and pushing beer/alcohol orders - thankfully my sister ordered a beer or I fear we'd have been pressured to order drinks throughout the meal.  Receiving her beer my sister noted it was quite good - to me it tasted like beer.  Ordering two pizzas we sat and chatted while watching the cooks in the open kitchen spin dough, chop vegetables, and assemble the pies.

No more than 15 minutes passed before we were brought our well cooked thin-and-crispy pizzas, ideally prepared with just a little bit of char on the edge.  The first option, Apple and Prosciutto Pizza with Gorgonzola and red wine was a great blend of sweet and savory with wonderfully sweet and tender skinless apples contrasting eloquently against the somewhat crisp and amply salty prosciutto.  Adding a layer of creaminess a small amount of un-salty gorgonzola was added to the dish along with a slight bit of bitterness coming from the merlot.  Hints of chives and possibly coriander also crept though with bites towards the center and as a whole this was as good, if not better than the Brie pizza at Spagio in Columbus - with a much better crust.

The second pizza, Sunnyside Pizza with eggs, provolone, pancetta, and lots of black pepper lived up to its name - IE, it tasted like a lot of Black Pepper - and maybe some eggs.  A noted fan of all things featuring a yolk I had very much looked forward to trying this pizza but unfortunately any nuance or subtlety was entirely eliminated by the incredible degree of over seasoning.   Salty Pancetta, the tongue/mouth-feel of yolk, and pepper pepper pepper.  I will admit I appreciated the crispy and perfect crust of this pie, but otherwise a piece of bread with olive oil (which we weren't given) topped with black pepper would have been nearly on par.
After our meal we were offered desserts (ironically, Jeni's Ice Creams) but instead opted to eat our cupcakes from Grandma Freda's while listening to some Nirvana.  

All told I must admit I was modestly impressed with Bar Cento and the prices were certainly manageable compared to the vastly overpriced and overhyped Lola - I'd like to go back at some point for the chicken and gnocchi.  According to my sister, the alcohol list was quite extensive and affordable, so perhaps for beers and bites the place would be better and I bet it would also be a good place to catch a Cavs game - certainly better than average ""bar food"" and a setting/scene better than the average ""dive bar.""",2009-05-22 20:46:36

We had popped in last week after the movies but they were closing in ten minutes so we decided to give it a try when we had more time.  Let me start by saying, WOW.  I enjoy Mediterranean food immensely and have had it in many restaurants and Kabob-Je did not disappoint.  We were warmly greeted and sat quickly.  We went over the menu.  I admit, I had anticipated eating here so I had looked at their menu online earlier. We started with the Hummus and Falafel appetizers.  They came out very fast.  They both were served with a large, freshly baked piece of pita.  The falafel was very good and the menu claimed it to be vegan which is good to know.  It was served with many accompaniments; tahini, lettuce, diced tomato, diced radish, fresh parsley and mint leaves.  The Hummus was probably the best I have ever had.  It was extremely smooth and creamy.  Without asking our server brought us more freshly baked pita. It was so fresh it was still pillowed with steam!  Our entrees came next. My partner ordered the Shrimp Kabobs and I had the Scallop Kabobs. Both were served with generous portions of grilled vegetables (squash, zucchini, onion) and yellow basmati rice topped with dried fruit. It was a sensational meal, some of which we brought home to finish later.  I watched the other tables to see what other dishes looked enticing.

Since our friends wanted to try it out, we decided to go back. It was not at all busy when we went & were told we could sit at any table. We really wanted to sit outside but were warned that there's a golf course behind the restaurant, thus there is a mosquito problem.

We grabbed a table & our waiter came to greet us & take our drink order right away. I thought it was disgusting that he acknowledged that there was a mosquito squashed on the page of the menu but gave it to me anyway. I think that it wouldn't have taken much effort to go grab another menu. It was his first day I guess.

We got the Oatmeal Stout beer & the pink Moscato for drinks and the bistro burger & the salmon cakes for our meal. Both of the food dishes were good. The bistro burger was large & filling and the side of fries was also tasty. I think for the price we paid for the salmon cakes, it would've been nice to get an actual side instead of just the spring greens.

We ended up walking quite far from St. Catherine and Peel because we were just wandering around and ended up seeing a big block of Asian restaurants including Chinese, Japanese and Korean food. 

We saw a quite few soup dumping places but decided on this one because of the overall reviews plus the price ($7.99 to $8.99 for 10 dumplings).  This is a great price because usually the soup dumplings are $5.99 for 6.  We had two orders of soup dumplings, I believe one was beef and the other was chicken.  Since I don't eat meat that often anymore, I may not be the best connoisseur for this, but my DC loved both of them as they were full of juice and flavour but not too salty.  There was a lot of natural meat flavour and the wrapping wasn't too starchy. 

We also ordered the wonton soup which was great.  The great thing about this place is that it's roomy, they have an open kitchen and the service is okay.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, very casual with dark colors.  We had the chef pick our menu since one of our group members was friends /w the executive chef.  We tried about 10 dishes total and most of them were really good.  Oysters/Shrimp cocktail very fresh.  Salmon tartare yummy.  Poached egg salad /w lardons - really loved how the egg broke and egg yolk spewed into the salad and sauce, perfect combo.  Bone marrow with oxtail jam - bone marrow was very weird tasting.. some people described it as having the taste of bleach..hmmm oxtail jam was very scrumptious.  Escargot baked in puff pastry was very garlicky good.  Flat bread pizza was meh.  Fried skate with green beans and capers was just okay.  A lot of people loved it but I felt like the fish was very basic and nothing special.  Moules Frites - Mussels were fresh and great in their cream sauce.  French Fries were average - can't compare to Bouchon.  The Beef Bourguignon was pretty good actually - beef was very tender on the potato puree was very nicely prepared.  I would order this as a normal entree normally.  

The piece de resistance was their tomahawk steak for two.   The thing is huge and tastes great but came too late as everyone was super full to enjoy it.  It's a Saturday night special and would be awesome if it had came earlier actually.  Very tender meat and nicely garnished with garlic butter (see my picture).  

Dessert consisted of Apple Tart Tanin with vanilla bean ice cream, Chocolate Pot du Crème, and Profiteroles (cream puffs).  All three desserts were good but the cream puffs were unanimously voted best tasting.

The cookies themselves are very tasteful. As for the ice cream, I have only tried 3-4 flavors at this point and have always been very satisfied. Every scoop is flavor-filled and very rich.

1. San Tan wanted $35,000 and change for their Ford Fusion (yes it had all the bells including leather. I just couldn't see paying $10,000.00 more for a Fusion than a Prius with virtually the same options.

2. The sales manager ""Joe"" was pushy, manipulative, and used high pressure tactics in an attempt to close me on other cars and / or a much higher payment. I never could get a straight answer on how much the car cost and instead was hammered on the payment. The other thing that scared me was the fact that they wanted to give me only $2800.00 at the outset for my trade when I knew full well that it was worth at least $5,000.00 at the auction and was further verified by Kelly Blue Book. I later sold my trade to an individual for $5500.00 cash. 

3. I got repeated calls from these guys trying to get me back into the dealership and every time they kept bumping the trade value of my car up...if they wanted my business they should have given me the best deal up front rather than playing games with me.

4. They made me feel like they were trying to ""play"" me.

***Oh and Sam Cumbo mentioned in the other review STILL WORKS THERE! 

Anyway I just bought from Big Two Toyota (around the corner from them) and they gave me a great deal for less than Edmunds said I should have paid. I was treated like solid gold and got 48 months interest free! 

Stay away from San Tan Ford.  If you want a sure enough deal go see Chris Davis at Big Two Toyota Scion in the internet fleet department. He's honest, professional, and sells cars the way they are supposed to be sold. Here is his phone number: (480)287-3191",2009-05-23 04:13:32

I had the sss scallop poke bowl with pineapple slaw, crab salad, seaweed salad, all the crispy toppings, nori, tobiko, soba and greens. With so much going on, I really didn't know what to expect. The result was sensational! It really combined everything that I like eating and made it into a taste bud bonanza. My only comment would be that next time I'd like a bit less sauce. The sauce really pulled everything together with a bit of a kick.

Hubs had the salmon and tuna burrito roll. That was a tad underwhelming for me though. The texture of the rice with 'squishy' nori and all the ingredients didn't pull together as well for me. I'd definitely try the combo in a bowl though next time to see if that works any better.

The atmosphere is casual and cafeteria like. The staff are super helpful and friendly. It wasn't busy when we dropped by so they were able to spend a lot of time explaining the options to us.

Lobster Salad
Hamachi Salad
Rolled Seabass (we both had that)
Chocolate ball with Hazelnut middle
Red Velvet with creamy cheese

My boyfriend and myself have over 30 years in resturant and customer service experience and I always take a moment to compliment great service, however this time  I was so incredibly disappointed that I felt it was necessary to speak out about how not only was the food FAIR but the lack of customer service was borderline pathetic.  

The hummus had no flavor, and the pitas were about the same. When we placed our orders, they were out of the three dishes we had inquired about. After about 20 minutes my boyfriend's meal came out and it was cold, I then sat there for 7-10 minutes awaiting for my salad wondering why it was taking forever and as to why you would bring out one meal and not the other with zero explanation. I have had mint salad at other middle eastern restaurants however this was not so amazing, and should really be served as a side dish and not a meal, especially being $9.00 I also asked for chicken to be added which consisted for an additional $4.00 (4 pieces).

The guy who took our order was too busy in conversation with everyone else and never once checked on us, although he was sure to make eye contact with me about 5 times. Eventually, the gal who was working (Brittany) stopped over to fill drinks and see if we needed anything...she was the only positive thing about this experience. 

I expressed my concerns to Brittany who went to tell the owner that we were not happy with the experience and all she can say was sorry sorry sorry and never offered to make things right,  and pushed for us to have ""a little dessert to go""...which I did not want. I wanted my ""meal"" comped which would have been the right thing to do, aside from the apology and to leave. 

The guy who originally took our order came over to apologize and did nothing but give me a list of excuses on why he may have dropped the ball... in which I called him out on, this guy really should look into another profession because customer service was not his strong suit tonight. 

Bottom line, I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are many middle eastern restaurants ASU who have superior service and much better food.",2012-09-12 06:39:06

We were so excited when we found Med Fresh!   The best dish is not even advertised on their menu board - Iskendar.  Crispy pita bread topped with beef doner meat.  A tomato sauce is poured over the top and topped with garlic butter. Dollops of yogurt sauce completes this dish.  It is out of this world!!!!  We have had this in Turkey and it is more delicious than I remembered.  A real treat is the homeade baklava.  

The chicken kabobs are lemony and moist.  The plate comes with rice pilaf, yummy salad, hummus, pickle and pita bread.  I usually split it with my daughter because it is so big.  The chicken doner is a nice treat either on a bed of rice or as a pita wrap.  Salads are generous in size and we love the dressing.  The ingredients are fresh and healthy.  The restaurant is always clean and the owners are very nice and welcoming.  Prices are reasonable especially for the amount of food you get.  The chai (tea) is delightful.

I will often opt for a few of the apps for a meal instead of an actual entree. My all time fave is the house made Pate with a blueberry coulis. I love their Pate, give it a try. The Buffalo Shrimp are also very good as is the Calamari, Caesar Salad and Cobb Salad.

For a main, try the Burgers, the Curries, Fish and Chips and the Ploughman's Lunch. I have not yet had a meal from the Abbot that I didnt like.

I have waited for this day for a whole year, ever since rumours started popping up that I may be rescued from my grocery-shopping misery. I never thought I would see this day during my lifetime, considering the slow construction of the place until just three weeks ago!

They really hyped up the opening and were greeted by a line up of store-goers, spectacle-watchers, and gift card-snatchers running from Church St all the way past Yonge & College. The inside is GINORMOUS, like so big that if you lose your toddler there... Yikes, you are in hell of a lot of trouble.

I really approve of their extremely accessible wide wide aisles. You could probably fit 4 shopping carts/scooters/wheelchairs or 15 little babies sitting side by side. Prices seemed decent. I saw a lot of yellow sale tags. But for those in the area who are actually trying to go here for some groceries, you may have to wait a little while longer. Right now it is just a zoo for people trying to get in on the exciting action. I really sincerely hope that they'll have downtime soon because otherwise it is just a small-grocery-store-nightmare repeated x 5 billion and really high ceilings.

I'm always skeptical when a restaurant has 5 stars with over 50 reviews, but I came to Garden Grill with an open mind.  And man, this place is very good.  Plant-based ingredients, terrific dishes, and surprisingly large portions.  The meal had a hangover cure feel to it as the sandwiches were full of heavy ingredients and sauce and bread, but still terrific.  The California Burrito ($12) was the size of a large Chipotle, full of beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, plant-based steak, cheese, and french fries.  I could have done without the french fries and cheese but the rest of the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The hot sauce was awesome as well; don't forget to get extra.  The buffalo chicken sandwich ($10) had  a little too much sauce, but the meat itself was so flavorful that I'll give the sauce overload a pass. Add the great coleslaw on the sandwich and we have a winner. 

The prices are of a sit down brunch spot overall but the portions are big and service was great and quick. The bread greatly underperformed in my opinion on the sandwich as well as the tortilla for the burrito, which is the main reason I'm knocking Garden Grill down from a 5 star experience.  I do really like that they park specifically at Farmer's Market which show the spot's freshness.  I would come here often if they opened a storefront.  Here's to hoping.",2017-05-13 22:56:27

I ended up just renting the harness and used my own shoes. Saved me $3 :) 

After finding it, it was.... well not what I was expecting lol nothing like the little fun ones you see around town. It's way more intense rock climbing. If your planning on bringing kids under 12 years old, I really don't recommend it. It's more for a little older kids.

What I didn't like is you have to harness your own kids to climb the rocks. You have one end and your kids have the other end. It's a little dangerous, that's why I don't recommend younger kids. 

After leaving here I was very tired lol Man, I admire the people that enjoy rock climbing because it's no joke. It's not as easy as you think it is. Don't think I'll be coming back.

So we went in and Putumayo music was playing in the background. It's a series that features music from all over the world - from Arab to Cuban to Indian to African - put together by these creative artists from France. It's just the right type of ambiance you may need if ever you plan a tea party at home or just decide to chill by the balcony sipping some tea. 

My favorite Teavana flavor is a white tea mix - Youthberry Wild Orange Blossom. They give out samples of these right in front of the store so be sure to grab some if you pass by. Not only does it taste good, but it also garners a lot of benefits for the health conscious with elements that help increase metabolism, it also contains a lot of antioxidants  (catechins) that sweep up free radicals (they're the insiduous rats that wreak havoc in your body damaging DNA), promotes healthy skin, teeth and gums etc. 

And if you happen to be around the mall during closing time like we did, try your luck at this.

Although it is the cheapest in town for AYCE sushi, I am just not impressed with the selection. Many rave about the appetizers, & I have found that although the kimchi fried rice is good, I don't want to eat fried rice when I am eating sushi... it just doesn't make sense to me.
Many of the rolls are made with nothing but fillers (i.e. avocado, cream cheese, crab mix) & no real substance.. aaaaand on top of that, the fish is no where near fresh. Their hamachi was YELLOW. Disgusting! 
Oh, I also asked for my unagi to be crispy, expecting that it would be baked, but instead, they seared it with the torch! Yuck, again. 
Their service is not the worst, but not the best. The lone male server, who I believe to be the manager, is the only one who was actually tending to us. Once he went on break, my bf & I were stuck waving someone fown.every time we needed something!

It doesn't work.  A Chilean sea bass is destroyed.  It's subtle oily flavor hammered by a fiery chili paste.  Marinated Cornish hens with garlic so overpowering that only it's shape and mouth feel let you know what is.  Just the opposite, using rib steak in the drunken noodles robs the dish of the beefy flavor and  sinewy, fatty texture that a humble cut of beef would bring.  

Thankfully there are more traditional dishes that really shine.  

The Pla Tod Yum Ta Krai (fried whole tilapia with lemongrass salad, dried shrimp and cashew nuts) is excellent.  The flesh of the fish, overcooked and rubbery near the skin just as it should be.  The slight muddy flavor enhanced by the dried shrimp, perfumed by lemongrass and brightened by a lime, chili, and fish sauce drizzle.

Lo-Ba (braised then fried pig ear, tongue, and heart served with fresh cucumber and ""sauce"") sounds disgusting.  It's well worth the try.  Trust.

Too adventurous, the Moo Hong (Braised pork belly with black soy, palm sugar, and black pepper) or the Pou nim pad prik Thai (fried soft shell crab with soy, garlic, black pepper and green onion) both make for good eats.

Most vendors proudly offered samples and  I even noticed a sign for wine-tasting. They also took debit, though I'm sure cash is preferred. 

I love that parking is validated though the process has thrown some for a loop. Park. Shop up to 90 minutes, RIGHT BEFORE YOU LEAVE - (and before your 90min is up) Validate using the machine across from the sushi joint by the door. You will then have 20 minutes from that moment to drive through the exit gate. It definitely is a little process but it is so worth it.

However, my friend invited some of us to stop by here Friday to celebrate her just-received and hard-earned master's degree from ASU. So I went. We ate in the oyster bar area. The place is really cute. Sure, it looks kind of corporate, but in a nice way. It's definitely the kind of place I would want to stop by for drinks with my friends. The wine list was OK, and they had some nice sake and martinis. Our waitress was great and really friendly. 
The seafood platter they ordered smelled good.. and everyone who ate it said it was tasty.
It's definitely a bit pricey, but if the seafood is really that fresh, I guess it's worth it. 
I'll probably bring my parents here when they visit and then I'll try something off the menu. The choices (aside from the sushi and seafood platters) range from pricey things like $20+  for the trout or the macadamia-nut crusted halibut to $12 tuna melts.

They do participate in delivermefood.com's service (a third party restaurant delivery service), but there are order minimums that depending where you want it delivered may be hard to meet when just getting lunch for one. I couldn't meet the $30 minimum for my neighborhood so I called in an order. I was impressed that I was given just a 10-15 minute wait time when I called at noon. 

I ordered the Shawarma Plate on Hummus. It was served (see photo) in a rectangle to go container. It was completely filled with hummus and then layered with thin and small chopped pieces of well done beef. It was wonderfully flavoured with onion and parsley. I was given three full sized soft circle pitas with it - way more than I needed, but one is great to have so you can mop up all the left over hummous with it. Even with taking hummous with each forkful of meat there was so much left at the end to dip the pita in. 

Wonderful filling lunch! If you've not tried Nate's definitely make a visit soon. They only take cash, but there are two banks on the same block as them.

There were about 15 upstairs staring at us, about 5 at the bar, and 15 or so more servers just chillin around the restaurant.  Somehow, with all these people, they managed to completely ignore us for most of our meal.  Making a typical 45 minute to 1 hour dinner experience turn into a 2 hour ordeal.

The decor of this place is beautiful.  Cool, clean, and modern.  The music fluctuates from being too loud and inappropriate for the setting to being perfect with an eclectic but well blended mix. 

The pizza is decent, but very appetizer-ish.  It is cracker thin, which turns a lot of people off, but I actually like it.  The onion strings are to die for when they aren't completely grease laden.  That's an off and on thing, not really consistent.  I don't like their sandwiches.  They are unimaginative and bland.  There really isn't a lot to choose from on the menu.

It was the service that was somewhat off.  I decided before I went to try the signature tasting menu--four courses with choices in each section.  

First course was a choice of a salad or Castilian soup.  I ordered the soup.  My server came back in a short time to tell me they no longer have that soup, and she showed me a menu from which I could choose from three different dishes.  I opted for the Lobster gazpacho.  The server then said, ""You know that's cold, don't you?""  Do I look that much like a rube? (that's rhetorical!)  The gazpacho was excellent.  Great tomato flavor and there were several pieces of tasty lobster.

Course two was the creamy risotto with wild mushrooms and manchego cheese.  The risotto was very flavorful and very enjoyable!

For the third course, I chose the Crispy chicken breast roulada with sautéed potatoes, pork chorizo, and roasted red pepper.  Very tasty!

Finally, I was allowed to order anything off their dessert menu rather than choose from the two choices on the tasting menu.  I chose the molten chocolate cake, with orange jelly and blood orange sorbet.  I didn't taste any orange jelly.  The sorbet was sitting on top of some chopped mango.  The cake and the sorbet were very tasty.  It's nice they allow you to choose any dessert because they're all the same price.

As for the service, aside from the question about gazpacho mentioned above, I was enjoying the risotto and was not yet finished with it when the server brought the chicken roulada and placed it along side the risotto.  It's not like the place was crowded and they were moving the guests out quickly.  Shouldn't a server check before they bring out a dish like this?  My iced tea was not refilled until it was time to order dessert.  It should have been much sooner.  I wonder why a tapas place like this bothers with a tasting menu. 

The dinner was good but it wasn't something that caused me to think that I had to return to this restaurant.  There are too many other places.",2012-05-29 16:17:56

It is not exactly on Wellesley but it is very easy to find. When on Yonge, turn west onto Wellesley and you'll see a large 24-hour store called RABBA on the north side. You should see a Ramen Raijin sign telling you to turn into the small side street. Essentially Ramen Raijin is on the back side of RABBA. 

The space has changed. The kitchen looks bigger. The dining area consists of a huge long table, with side tables as well as single seats at a bar. There is now also a small area like a convenience store selling bento boxes and Japanese snacks like mochi ice cream! Service is the same, very friendly and perhaps the waitresses are too eager to take your order (which is way better than not being attended to). 

The food is the same, same price as before and same quality. Others have mentioned that the price is quite steep and I agree. You don't get a lot of toppings for the price and additional toppings will cost you at least $1.75 which is pretty crazy. But I think the quality is excellent. The noodles have been perfect for me everytime. The soup is piping hot and very rich. 
I like to order the Gyokai Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen which is very flavourful, fatty and not overly salty. I order a smaller portion of noodles because the broth is very heavy (price = $10.50 for small and without egg). The only toppings were one slice of cha-shu, bean sprouts, green onion, nori and canola. Ramen Raijin is my #2 ramen shop in d/t Toronto with Ramen Isshin being #1.

There were 8 of us for a business lunch.  4 of us are larger than normal men.  We were placed at one of the round tables that may have fit 8 smaller people comfortably but we were all uncomfortable at this table as there was no room to move once we were seated.

The should say something when they give your drink orders that it's going to be a while until you see a refill.  Eventually everyone received a refill except for me.   What's so hard about refilling unsweetened iced tea?  

On the meal, i asked for a side green salad without the pecans that came with it.  I watched the server write this down so something got screwed between typing it into the ordering system and the preparer because the salad came out with pecans on it.  I'm allergic to pecans but I picked them out anyway the best i could.  I should have sent it back.

At this point I'm still waiting for a refill on my tea as the rest of my table gets refills on their drinks.  

Finally the meal comes out and I am able to snag another server to refill my tea.  

I ordered a pasta dish.  Well the penne pasta was undercooked.  At this point I feel I'm a customer at Hell's Kitchen.  So I drink my tea.  Wrong move.  

The server came around to check refills on drinks and was noting everyone.. Twice I had to tell her to refill mine as she missed it the first time she marked it down on her mental list.

Finally a refill.  But it was gone in no time.  Do I dare ask for another one?

I have since come to realize I really like Asian spicy, I do not like Mexican spicy.  So I'm a food racist.

Our first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken.  The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy.  The orange sauce was amazing.  It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there.  We still order this every time.  The lemon chicken is nice.  A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken.  Another good bet.

Since then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Holy Crap!  You have never tasted how good prawns can be until you eat the Honey Walnut Prawns.  The lovely little crustaceans are served on a bed of shredded cabbage.  They are smothered in a sweet and tangy mayo sauce (I know it sounds kind of gross, but trust me and try it).  Then sprinkled all over the top are this wickedly good honey glazed walnuts.

The Positives:
The restaurant has an incredible range of tequilas that are delicious on their own or mixed in any one of their lip smacking margaritas. Grande Guacamole comes in a traditional stone mortar which they then prepare in front of you with fresh avocados, lime juice, tomato, and onion. I do love my guac, but Is it worth $10? I'm not so sure about that. 

The staff are also friendly and fun to talk to. Your food comes out promptly and cooked well. You even have the option to get it to go! 

Lighting is dark and atmosphere reminds me of a lounge where you go for happy hour. They have an upstairs area, a larger seating area, and a bar with surrounding high top tables. Colors are vibrant and I'm assuming are intended to evoke the ""life"" the restaurant bears as its name. 

The Cons:
Many of the menu items will cost you more than $15... even $20 for 5 pieces of shrimp, ""yea but they're five really good pieces"" the waitress assures me. And even if the tacos are cheaper, they're not the best items this place offers. The skirt steak and enchiladas have potential and of course their plantains are the best in Charlotte. I wasn't impressed by any of the other sides and I think that the pineapple coleslaw needs work. 

What they have mastered however, is the flavors in each dish. I'm not Mexican (even if i might look like it), but it all tastes and looks authentic to me. And by Mexican, I mean they use cilantro haha :P

I just think there's something missing from this restaurant that would make it a 5, but its not terrible enough to be a 3. You'll have a good time and eat some nice food, but you'll forget it the day after tomorrow :/

While it may have not have lived up to the expectations my prejudgments had given it, Nacho Daddy has several endearing qualities.

The food orders served here are all huge. Double check your appetite before ordering. The mountain of Vegan nachos we ordered filled me up for most of the day. At first their menu prices seem steep, ($15.99 for some nachos??) yet the amount they give you reflects the cost.

Speaking of that mountain... I appreciate that they have several Vegan options here. I just don't feel that melting some Daiya onto tortilla chips is really ""nachos"" to me. Sure it had all the other toppings, including a pile of guacamole and a sausage type crumble. I just need my nachos to be ""saucy"". These weren't doing it for me. A for effort. D for execution.

The Tex-Mex burrito while big in stature, was small on taste. It was pretty much filled with unseasoned rice. We took it back to the hotel with us, but never finished it. I'm not normally one to waste food, so that pretty much sums up this burrito.

Any place that serves a gigantic plate of Vegan nachos is a friend of mine. The beer specials don't hurt their cause either. $10 for a 22oz bomber of Rogue Voodoo Donuts Pretzel Raspberry Stout was a steal considering you can't find it for less at most stores. I went with the Highwater Campfire Stout instead, which was also a pretty good deal. They also have plenty of beers on tap, and a whole page dedicated to various flavors of margaritas. While I didn't partake in the bottomless Bloody Mary bar for $16, they seem to pour the vodka using a heavy hand from the few cups I observed being filled.

Perhaps their newer downtown Vegas location would be more convenient for you, yet don't pass up an opportunity to check out the original. Daddy Nacho knows how to pick his staff. Any of the ladies employed here could work down the street at Twin Peaks if they so desired. The bartender was very good at her job, interacting with customers and pouring drinks.

The buttery crust was the right level of crispiness and the mozzarella was gooey and perfectly melted.

You get tasty food and extremely attractive high school/college girls feeding you. You know if you like that then you'll like it here. Some days the girls are rude and the sandwiches sloppy but trust me you'll just keep on coming back!!! Bumper stickers everywhere that piss most democrats off. Some republicans too lol. The bathroom sucks and depending on the girl's day/mood it's for employees only haha. 

This place is a gem and I'd defend it in a heartbeat. Not only because the food is good but because this place HAS a soul. You can just feel it when you walk in and I mean that for a majority of the customers and the girls. 

As far as Bill.. he's gone now... forever will he hold a special place in our hearts and if it weren't for him you wouldn't have this little shit hole. We love you. Thank you for some of the best memories of my life, the girls lives and the customers. May you rest in peace.",2018-04-05 05:16:02

We went inside and were seated immediately.  As soon as I sat down, I felt a little anxiety.  They do a bustling take out business but their waiting area is very tiny and it was right next to our table.  It felt like people were on top of us the whole time.  Every time you would lift your head, someone was there or looking your way.  A little bit uncomfortable.  If there is a next time, hopefully we will sit someone against the wall or something.  Anyways..........placed our order for Diet Cokes and actually used the Yelp check-in app in order to score us 2 free egg rolls!  We decided to go with Mongolian Beef and Orange Peel Chicken.  Here is how everything tasted...............

Egg Rolls-  Best part of the meal, by far!  There were 2 of them and you could tell they were homemade and they tasted great.  They are served with a little sweet and sour sauce with a pinch of hot mustard.  The egg rolls and sauce were delicious.  They were hot, fresh, crispy and hearty for being such small things.  I would definitely get them again and maybe even a few orders of them  in addition to the free one you get from the Yelp app. 

Mongolian Beef-  This was presented nicely with a ton of onions and beef.  I am spoiled though and am used to certain kinds of Chinese food (Golden Chopsticks in National City rings a bell).  I dug in to this and it tasted ok.  The meat was a little tough though and could have been seasoned just a bit more.  Not bad in any way, just nothing compared to other places that I have had Mongolian Beef before.  Portion size seemed just a bit skimp too.  Overall, it was just ok.

Orange Peel Chicken-  Once again, I am used to certain things when it comes to Chinese food and this was totally different.  Their Orange Chicken is basically a breaded chicken breast cut up into strips a la chicken katsu.  It was covered in a sweet tasting sauce that was just ok.  The breading on the chicken fell off pretty easily which was kind of annoying.  Once again, the portion was a tad skimp.

White Rice-  Rice was ok.  They give you a huge container of it at least.

Overall, everything was just alright.  We ate all the food presented to us and didn't have any leftovers (rare with Chinese food...it boils down to the kind of skimp portions though) and were not totally stuffed to the brim.  Service, while friendly, was a tad slow.  Will I come back?  Eh...possibly.  My wife doesn't eat Chinese food other than Pick Up Stix and PF Changs, so I will probably be rolling solo if I do come back.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing stood out as super delicious either.  A-OK about sums it up....maybe even on the low end of A-OK.  Total bill for everything including tip was around $30.00.  Fair enough I guess.",2014-11-30 07:36:27

Tonight, was one of the saddest eating experiences of my life.  I took like 9 bites and just couldn't eat anymore because I disliked it so much.  I got the tonkotsu shoyo.   Just something about the broth tasted so bad to me.  Like something in my brain telling me that I shouldn't be eating it.   But every other review seems to think it's fantastic.  The meat in it was okay.   And I'm sure their noodles are prepared correctly but they were too hard for my taste.

Food...good
People...nice
Service...uneven at best

I ordered a TUNBRÖDSRULLE which is advertised as the king of Swedish street food.  I saw Tony Bourdain eat one of these things on TV once and I put it on my list of things to do.  First, you should note this is certainly the only place in AZ where you can get a TUNBRÖDSRULLE and quite possibly the only place you can get one for several hundred miles in any direction.  So if nothing else they have the market cornered on TUNBRÖDSRULLE.

So you ask...what's a TUNBRÖDSRULLE?  Well, it's served with mashed potatoes, one or two sausages, salad, tomatoes and räksallad (shrimp salad) all wrapped in a soft thin tortilla bread and covered with a thousand island like sauce.  For the most part it tastes about like it sounds.  It wasn't bad, but to be sure its one more thing checked off my bucket list.  As a side note, if there was shrimp salad in the thing I couldn't detect it.  

Also ordered  the Jagar Schnitzle with fried potatoes.  It was actually quite good.

On an aside, I forgot how much Scandinavian food uses dill.  I'll be belching this meal for quite a while.

Overall a place I'd do again although I've sworn off TUNBRÖDSRULLE and will probably be a little more mindful of my dill intake in the future.

I had been waiting for a good time to get over and try out Seoul, and finally made the time with some friends on Saturday night. I repeat, wow. Nothing could have prepared me for the deliciousness that awaited. 

My fiancee and I arrived around 7:45 to put our names on the list. We milled around the bar area and checked out the menu while waiting on the other two in our party. A couple of TVs in the dining room were playing college football games, and the two TVs at the bar were playing Korean (I presume) music videos with the audio coming thru the house speakers. The place was packed, which is obviously a good sign, and we were finally seated around 8:15.

While still waiting on friends we placed an order for the pimento corn cheese. A healthy scoop of the pimento corn cheese is served with what I can only describe as a potato chip that has the texture of a cheese puff... or a cheese puff in the shape of a potato chip. Anyway, so good. The sweetness of the corn was a great complement to the pimento cheese.

Once everyone arrived, we essentially just ordered everything on the menu. I personally got the pulled pork which had great flavor and the lightly drizzled sauce added a nice zing to the dish. I would highly recommend the Ramen Mac 'n' Cheese, a creamy mac 'n' cheese dish with ramen noodles serving as the pasta. I also tried the crispy park belly (meh), sriracha cracklins (great flavor with the sriracha powder, but I've never cared for cracklins), and the sweet potato birds nest (essentially stringy fried sweet potato rolled up into the shape of a bird's nest).

The service was excellent, especially given how busy they were. Our waiter (Jude I believe his name was [Hey Jude {great song |I digress|}]) took great care of us even though it was our first time, we were indecisive, and had SO many questions.

Everyone I know who spends any time in Forest Hill used to speak volumes of this place of how good the service and food is at this place.
I happened to find myself in the area and went to have a meal.

The server seemed pleasant enough but wasn't very good at checking on us: our waters and coffee always needed a prompt to refill and he seemed far more interested in a young lady at another table to remember we're paying customers. He needed to be asked to take a beverage order in the first place.

The food wasn't great. We were told that a Mediterranean platter had grilled eggplant, chopped vegetables, hummus, and egg. I'd pictured an eggplant sliced in half, fresh grilled and slathered in tehini. Instead, little bits of different veggies, a couple sliced hard-boiled eggs, a few small slices of pre-prepared eggplant, and tasteless (pimiento-stuffed!) olives adorned the plate with a small bowl of hummus. Very disappointing and overpriced.
A shwarma plate that was supposed to come with a salad and hummus came with neither. Sumac overpowered fluffy rice that accompanied a half-plate of meat that had clearly been sitting for a while: it was cold and the fat solidified. I watched the spit in the back, it seemed meat was being cut when it was nearly overdone rather than to order. Clearly missed was both the ability to turn down the heat to keep the shwarma from overcooking when it's quiet and to serve meat at a safe temperature.
On the plus side, the salad we did get was tasty and fresh.

The pho broth was a little on the weak side, but definitely beefy. The meat was good, though a little less red than desired, but plentiful.

The bean sprouts were day old and the lettuce in the fresh rolls was rather green an wilted.

The grilled pork was very tasty though and they obliged me and made the fresh rolls with grilled pork. 

80% of the tables had Asian people sitting at them, though this place is a buffet restaurant at some point in the week. I was concerned that the front door says the place to go for Vietnamese and Chinese food, but they did a decent enough job with their Pho today.

So I went back a few more times and it was consistent...I'm happy with it here. It is the best in the world? No. Is it confusing that no one in the restaurant seemed to have Vietnamese food and everyone was eating what looked like Chinese food? Yes...do I really care?

No!

And most importantly, I really enjoy their food. I've now sampled a bunch, and although some dishes stand out more than others, everything is at least very good.

I like that they use fresh, good quality ingredients, and I like their no-fuss preparation of the food.

Times are hard, I'm at the point where I can't think of many positive things about the future and most of my future plans don't extend beyond getting thru the week. 

Present tense, I spend most of my time looking for more ways to make money than the 3 stooges did with all the odd jobs, schemes, etc. Applying has just become something that makes everyone doubt one's strongest abilities. And thanks to the internet, I now have to worry about personal information and credit theft and automated, untraceable scams offering me more income if I ""spend a little money to make a lot of money.""

So that leaves the past. We can always find things that were great before, especially before the ""big change."" Even though locations have changed, I've always found San Gennaro's at least consistent in it's offerings every year I went. 

Every year, I say I want to go to Clark County Fair. And every year, I had work, didn't have money, or didn't have a way to get out far north of town where it often is located. So in valley festivals became the staple I counted on. 

I saw San Gennaro's as where I literally feasted 1-2 times a year. I ate more here than I did on Thanksgiving and X-mas, 2 holidays I was used to working instead of celebrating. 

Most festivals have similar components that people complain about every year, yet I didn't see attendances decreasing any. In fact, I'd say it's easily one of the top 10 events of the year I talked with friends about going to. There are many things that cost a lot and yet we go once or twice a year to ""reward"" or ""indulge"" ourselves. 

Most of these things I understand. Vendor booths are for whoever wants to pay them for the most part. Those booths have things from the miracle seen on tv products to hot tubs, to things you don't know why they're being sold. Usually, we checked out all the booths and ate. 

And before leaving, if something passed all my mental reasoning we'd go back and check something out one more time. Booths bargain more at the end of the night/ festival. 

The rides we know can be dangerous from the shoddy maintenance and wear, but we go on at least a few rides no matter how much the tickets are. And as a former ride mechanic, I have gone on rides, knowing there were ""extra parts"" still laying around the base of the ride. The scariest thing a man can see besides a kick in the crotch is a butter knife in a tool box. Dance with death.

There are a lot of things for kids to do, most cost money. The biggest moral dilemma I still think is neat is the live fish ping pong ball toss. It's cool kids can win fish as pets, they're simple(r) to take care of if they are healthy to begin with. As far as pets go, it's least traumatic when a goldfish passes away than a larger pet.

Most importantly, out of most yearly events, I think there's an issue of safety that's taken for granted. The Feast is always well lit, there is adequate police presence. I never saw fights break out in the midway that decreased the popularity of my hometown fair. 

Food is more of a focus than alcohol and team rivalry, or music that fans believe they need to be on hallucinogens to enjoy. I believe those are the biggest factor of public nuisances. I believe a full belly keeps people happy and non combative.

It's why I always thought of San Gennaro's feast as one of the most consistent festivals year after year for families, everyone.",2011-08-26 16:34:25

I had a pho, and it was yummy enough, with plenty of veg and tidbits to nom on.

During the summer's I usually order differently (you know, because of the heat?) So, here's the down low and this is what I think you should get too.

For appetizers, we started off with a little bit of off menu item:
Salt and pepper shrimp. This dish is just like every salt and pepper dish. A little salty and a little bit of kick with the pepper, it's delicious with any alcoholic beverage.

Mixed in with that we ordered our usual:
Calamari. Yes, my tip on calamari is still up and that is one dish I always get when I come here.

Finally, on to the Main Course. Since its summer, I order Bún. It's vermicelli, the thin noodles that's usually in the pho, but without the soup. If you see the type of pho I usually get (pho dác bîet) I substitute pho for bún. So this dish has basically everything on it plus the vermicelli noodles and other assortments of deliciousness.

The waitress was really nice, she had our sandwich cut into half and served in two plates with dressings on the side. The fries came in a bucket, enough for three of us.

If I had to rate the food on a standalone basis, then it's a 3.  If I include the beer selection and atmosphere, then this place easily moves up to a 4.  In terms of food, I've tried a few things now like the sausage, fries, and fried chicken and everything was adequate.  This is not the best place for dinner but the menu options are good enough for nibblers as you work through the beer menu.

Now onto the important stuff...Beer!  This place offers a very well though out beer list that zeroes in on quality. I think Bellwoods is a decent brewer and they always present some nice tap selections.  I find their stouts/porters are pretty well done, but their IPAs and saisons are less consistent but never seem to be below average.  I really do love their European and Quebec offerings.  Some of them get pricey but it's great to find a place that offers some of the highest quality imports along side their own local brews. I've tried some European beers which I could not find anywhere else in the city so it's always nice to open up your ""beer horizons"".  The list seems to keep changing in offerings but not in terms of breadth & quality, so keep up the good work!

As others have noted, this place can get very busy.  I personally like coming here on the early side before dinner or on the late side and I usually get in.

1. Last night we tried their Ricotta with fig which was meh... at the end of the day Ricotta is a bland and tasteless cheese that you have to dress or mixed with something for it to be palatable. Not my number one go to cheese dish.

2. Sausage Pizza - basically a mish mash  of everything for great color and instagram pictures however the flavors were not cohesive. PIzza crust was great, perfectly thin and crunchy where it counts. 

3. Next I had their clam tagliattelle the clam broth was delicious with lots of dill flavor. But the downside is, it was if as they had asked their distributer for the smallest unsellable clams to use for the dish. Tagliatelle texture was a bit sad and over done. 

4. Tiramisu - pretty good, nothing special

This was a second attempt at getting a table here. First time gave them my number after being added to the wait list. they called almost 3 hrs later saying they had a table for 3, but we had gone elsewhere to eat thank god. 

Pros :
-great food, platter looks appealing, made from scratch according to staff
-some dips are fantastic, falafels were great 
-place looks really cute inside
-enjoyed the honey cardamon differ 

Cons:
- took over an hr for food to appear on the table
- it's made from scratch was the reason given, and with all due to respect to maha and the kitchen staff. I cook from scratch, my mother cooks from scratch. We can pull together delicious food in half an hr for two ppl AT LEAST. I think the whole point of going to a great restaurant is that pros are going to present amazing dishes in a reasonable time.
-it was so crowded since its so small, it was cold since they wouldn't close the door as people waited and talked and let the cold air in as it rained. Couldn't take any photos due to the hordes of people, and that was a real bummer since it was a special outing for me and guest. 
- they don't take reservations which is mind boggling since obviously this place should be reservation only so that you're guaranteed to get a table and they can plan on how to prepare food in a timely manner based on the seating schedule. 
-due to time delay with food delivery, as we got hungrier and saw one table at a time served and felt our interest piqued by another dish we didn't order, we wanted to order other stuff. We may even have wanted to order more while we ate. But we were kindly told  at these later times that we cannot order more food because it would take another hour after the our first order was delivered eventually. They literally dissuaded people from ordering food at their restaurant. Obviously I'm not returning again to wait this long so while I'm here I wanted to order more stuff but instead the kitchen was as per usual too behind on orders. 
-ordered the mind blowing chicken sandwich, and it was ok and not mind blowing. Needed more acid, but I enjoyed the herbs and veggies and bread. 
-soup had been been blended to have zero texture and was not super hot when we got it. 

Verdict: not worth it 
Food was good but not earth shattering, and based on principle a daytime non-alcohol serving restaurant is obliged to be able to prepare food on time. And let people order more food at staggered times. And have the foresight to let people know that they have such a long waiting list they shouldn't wait for a table for 3 hours because it won't work out. It was frustrating and not pleasant sitting there crammed in a small resto with people, feeling hungry and wondering why they couldn't even manage giving us an app. Toronto has a plethora of fantastic eats.

When I've eaten at Ho Su, I've tried the bento boxes, the sushi/sashimi, and the bulgogi. In terms of flavor, everything was pretty good. 

The bento box was your standard bento box, but they do give you the tiny dishes in the beginning- something that not all sushi joints do. I just really enjoy the tiny soy beans that are in some type of sweet savory sauce. Not sure what it is, but it's like crack drizzled all over soy beans... YUMMY.

I've also tried the sushi/sashimi love boats. Fish was pretty fresh to me. One thing that I am very critical of is the salmon. I find that a lot of places cheap out on the cut of salmon that they give you. At Ho Su, I've never had a cheap cut of salmon. The salmon is always very pink and bright for the most part- no white parts= salmon belly= fat=the cheap stuff.

Bulgogi was good as well. Don't have much to say about it.

The place can get pretty cramped because it is a small restaurant, but it's still pretty good. Prices are also great for the quantity that you get. I can't finish the bulgogi, even if I were to share it with my boyfriend, but it's still so cheap. Gotta love cheap eats!",2013-03-19 19:20:17

Hubby tried the chicken pho and I a grilled pork chop atop pork fried rice.  The latter dish was the recommendation of the waiter (John) when I told him that I wanted pork but nothing with a sweet sauce. 
The pho came with the usual accompaniments: basil, jalapeños, lemon, and bean sprouts.  Hubby had ask them NOT to put noodles in and John suggested they add veggies instead. (Don't you hate a man that watches his figure?)  
He let me taste the broth and I thought it was incredibly delicious.  He thought the chicken was overcooked, but I reminded him that it was chicken breast and thinly sliced so the longer it's in the hot broth the more cooked it gets.  AND  what restaurant is going to chance serving barely cooked chicken? He cleaned his bowl and next time he wants to try the rare beef PHO.  My dish consisted of a very thin pork chop over a bed of fried rice--a real huge portion of rice.  The pork chop was not dry and had a char-like flavor.  The rice was NOT greasy and tasty.

The restaurant is conveniently located in a plaza with many other stores, so there is plenty of parking. The interior is clean and modern with the a dark wooden decor. According to one of the waitresses, the restaurant at this location has been a work in progress for a year.

The restaurant has the same menu as all the other Asian Legend restaurants. We ordered the xiao long bao with ground pork, the pan-fried crispy pancake with egg, beef brisket noodle soup, and green beans with dried shrimp. The xiao long bao was tasty as usual. The soup inside was not overly hot. The pancake was also good. We've tried it without the egg at other locations and didn't notice much of a difference except that the non-egg version is obviously crispier. The beef brisket noodle soup was tasty as well. The soup is spicy, as indicated on the menu, and adds a nice flavor to both the noodles as well as the beef. The green beans were tasty as well, but I thought the dried shrimp was too salty.

The opening of Asian Legend in the Maple area is a welcome change as there is a lack of good Chinese food in the area. We'll definitely be back.",2015-06-10 03:51:54

I had a crabload of crab to make the best of the $33.99, and the warm crab is so much better than the frozen cra(p) at many buffets. Even having to crack open the crab yourself isn't a problem, and it could be an advantage if you wanna slow down your pace.

I have no idea why the Yelp reviews that I read didn't mention the strange utensil that they provide to crack the crab, but yeah... it's actually pretty cool once you figure out that you have to find the soft parts of the shells (crack toward the wide sides, not the hard corners). Oh, and make sure the pointy end goes in.

More importantly.. . rum raisin gelato! Most of the other flavors that I tried were great (mango, chocolate chip, strawberry, peanut butter), but rum raisin has always been my favorite. The stuff at this buffet has like 5x the raisins as Haagen Dazs. Heck, pretty much all of the gelato here is way better than any ice cream and most desserts at Vegas buffets. I just wish I had a chance to try the coffee flavor before it ran out, but I guess I'll live... or come back.

Wine was decent and beer was fine according to tablemates. Orange juice was way too sweet, so ask them to give you half a glass or something so you can pour your drinking water into it until it's no longer orange sugar water. I enjoy sweet things, but not like this...

Other things to try: roast beef tri-tip (pink-er = tender-er), korean BBQ (flavor might be smeared on but texture is good), osso bucco (broken-down marrow and cartilage somehow are awesome)

Stuff to skip: sushi (looks like crap compared to real sushi buffets), anything starchy (too filling), anything you'd find at a fast food place (pizza, fries, much of the Asian area... looking at you)

Menu is simple but different.  A blend of Italian and Spanish offering lots of tapas and pastas.  Lunch menu is different than dinner as dinner offers tapas which are not for lunch.  A very good bar that has an active happy hour and lots of drink specials most every day.

There is another room off to the side where we have had dinner with our son's family of 5 so with us the 7 of us had a larger table and excellent service.  So if you have a large party, ask for this separate room.

They make a Bolognese sauce that really makes the lasagna and other pasta dishes sing.  Rich and meaty it is a treat.  Wife loves Bolognese and with their beet and goat cheese salad she sings.  I love the braised short ribs that are so tender and rich that you are challenged to get it all down.  Not that you don't want to, but the decadence of the dish overwhelmed me.

Our server (the owners daughter I believe) was my dream server. Super clear, efficient, on the ball and knowledgeable, all without being annoying in the least. As soon as I inquired about their gluten free options she immediately asked if I could have soy sauce or not - a telltale sign she knew what celiac was vs. trendy gluten free fad dieters and I knew I was in safe hands. 

Without missing a beat she listed off all the menu items that were celiac safe gluten free and which could be modified to accommodate my restrictions. So many options! I could eat most of the menu and for once didn't feel like I was stuck ordering the most boring menu item due my dietary restrictions.

Even when I asked if my Laksa could be made without the chicken she immediately told me it was also made with chicken stock as that might affect my choice - something few servers would do (I feel like so many servers have no friggin clue what's in the dishes they serve which makes no sense to me..).

Our dishes came out in perfect timing, were described to us while being put down, were beautifully plated and mine was always handed to me with a mention that it was gf and celiac safe. SO AMAZING. I cannot applaud this level of service enough. Our water was always full, our plates and utensils changed for each dish, and our server checked on us just the right amount without being too in our faces or too absent. THIS is how all restaurant service should be.

The food was really really good but there were some dishes that fell just a tad short. I also felt the prices were pretty high based on the quantity of food but the quality was always there. Anyways - a small flaw doesn't take away from the amazing service (seriously - she should go train other restaurants how to properly operate - she was outstanding) and the great vibe of the place (it's beautiful and cozy inside!). 

For our table of four, all the shared plates, 4 cocktails and 1 dessert came to approx. $200 before tip. As I mentioned, it is a little costly considering the portion size (we were satisfied but not super full) but the overall experience was perfect. Also need to remember we are on the Ossington strip so most restos are a little pricey. Anyways,I would rather have a great night out and not be stuffed than get huge portions in a shabby place with crappy service any day. Plus, sometimes you gotta treat yourself!

We had a wonderful night here and will definitely be back! (i'm thinking tasting menu for bday dinner..?!)

Pros 

- I went with a full rack of pork ribs and they were GREAT! Also... HUUUGE! Succulent, fall off the bone goodness that filled me far more than I expected it to. The BBQ sauce was excellent. Did I mention it was HUGE? You gotta try this!

- We ordered a large portion of the battered pickles and they were very good! And as a Yelper, you get 50% off when you check-in... so hey... THANK YOU YELP!

- Service was efficient and friendly. Our waitress was very accommodating and on point.


Cons 

- The appetizer pulled pork sliders were very underwhelming. I don't know if it was the pull pork or it was the buns but all in all, it left all of us wanting and comparing it to the delicious fried pickles, the difference was night and day.

- I ordered an alcoholic drink (root beer float) and while it was very good, it was also small. For its price, ($8.50) I didn't think I got great value off this. I would have ordered 2-3 drinks if they were more moderately priced.

I did see some empty spots behind the cone, but the person said it was full. Maybe it's for the VIP or something.

Upon entry, the process was fast. They'll ask to see ID if you want to drink alcohol and then they'll give you a wristband. Next move over to the next table where they will check your ticket. It's a quick scan off your phone. And then you're in.

The inside the venue itself is pretty nice spacious and clean. Not too sure what all the negative reviews were about. Restroom is located on the right side. The restroom for the men was pretty clean and well-maintained. No issues here.

Once you get into the main area they have the general admission which is pretty much on the floor. They do have the mezzanine or top second level floor, but you have to pay more for those ticket. Maybe it's because you get to sit down and have a small table. But if you're going to a concert, why would you sit up on the second floor?

Stage is pretty big. the lights in sound system are on point. I saw Boyce Avenue here. Good show overall.

There appears to be quite a lot of shows that are coming through this venue. Would recommend checking this place out if you do have an artist that is coming here.

In conclusion, if you can split the cost of the parking, which is $10. Then it should be no issues here. All the negative reviews might be outdated or something. And the staff that were working when I went were nice.

I loved the atmosphere, it was nice without being over the top. We ordered sake for the table. My husband and I had never had sake but we loved it! I can't remember which one we ordered but it was the recommendation of our server, it was an unfiltered option. 
We ordered the basil rolls for an appetizer, some with tofu and others with shrimp for the table and they were delicious. The sauce really made them. Tangy and spicy but nothing over the top, a medium spice. 
We all tried ordering various dishes so we could each sample them. I ordered the vegetable delight with tofu and a medium spice and was in love. Now that I have eaten there I would easily go to a higher spice because I like spicy food. The medium was really mild to me. 
I also sampled the green curry which was really good. I had never had curry before but I really enjoyed it and the flavor was also subtly sweet to me. 
We ordered a round of desserts for the table: the chocolate cake, fried banana with coconut ice cream and green tea ice cream.

Late night Special Review: 
For you late night diners like me, you appreciate places that open late. Here's a tip, After 10pm ask for the Lunch Menu. Its a special they have after 10pm you can order anything off the lunch menu, which is exactly like the dinner menu except for half the price. Dinner entree's range from $12-15 but off the lunch menu after 10pm everything's about $7.50.

Food:
So if your eating Chinese its always accustom to share, My friend Yuhi & I after an intense work out decided to ruin it by eating greasy Chinese food (Why not LOL). 

Egg Plant and Tofu: 
Super hearty, the fried tofu was crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside. The eqq plant was juicy and soft. Glad the skin of the eqq plant didn't feel like plastic. It practically melted in your mouth.

Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs:
I'm a die heart fan of Chinese pork ribs, not just any old sweet and sour pork. I special ordered it as pork ribs. The cooked pork with the in bone ribs adds a smokey flavor the the sweet and sour and just brings the flavors together in a sticky sweet and sour sauce. They garnish the place with big chunks of green pepper. onions and with a twist pineapples.

The decor of this place is very interesting and nicely decorated to fit the theme of the culture. The waiter was helpful and made sure to answer any questions that we might have.

I ordered a large jjajangmyun and wow was it a large portion! I'd say it's a good amount to feed two people for $9! It tastes as good as it looks too! I was also given two side dishes of kimchi and another plate of onions and yellow daikon.

We were there only an hour and ended up not even buying a drink since we had drinks on the way, what I liked about this place was the multi-level and the dance floor was the largest of the three clubs we hit that night.  I didn't feel as smooshed.  Still no sitting unless you buy a table, but although we did not buy one, my understanding is you can get bottles/tables a little cheaper here than the newer ""fancier"" clubs.

As for the music and the people, I pretty much thought it was exactly the same as what I had just seen & heard at 1OAK.  We danced until they said it was time for us to leave and had a good time here.  If I want to hit a club when I'm back in Vegas, I'm likely to return here.",2013-10-03 19:16:06

The smoothie bowls are my favourite because it bridges the gap between hunger and fullness. It's also a good snack alternative; better than smoothie I guess.

And hey, what's up with the 15% tip option when we are clearly not getting a table service? Having 15 as the lowest tipping option is - for the lack of a ​better word - a ripoff​. I typically tip 15 - 20% at a table service, but this is not one of those. 

The portions are not the greatest and the juices are ok. So what would people come here? I don't know actually. With so many bowl options for your meals and a gazillion smoothie places around, Calii doesn't stand out. 

I will agree that the prices are in the higher range, and I would have been ok with that if they were that good. They aren't. A smoothie is a smoothie is a smoothie. This chain would love to the differentiate itself, but rather unsuccessfully.",2018-08-05 01:18:53

We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was 3/4 empty.  Then, after ordering, I was presented with a Baby Spinach Salad without any dressing on it at all.  The Buttermilk Biscuit Croutons were very good, but the dish just did not come together as a whole.

The fairly large shrimp in a Shrimp Cocktail were meaty and cold, but not that tasty.  And the Horsey Sauce accompanying this app was just too mild.  When my entrée at length arrived, its diminutive appearance was quite underwhelming: two small fillets of Pan Seared Trout with Cilantro Rice, cut carrots, and Sweet & Sour Cabbage that was not juicy and neither particularly sweet nor sour.  The trout tasted better than it looked, but it was just average in quality.  

Service was very inattentive, and there was a long break between preliminaries and delivery of the entrees.  Seating was comfortable, but the whole vibe was more that of a coffee shop than a casino's featured restaurant.  It would be pretentious to call what was served to my party of four ""fine dining.""  

Reportedly a new executive chef is now in the kitchen, and some new menu items are already being phased in.  But I highly doubt that I will be back.  Even at a special January promotion price of 50% off for locals with a Downtown Grand My Points player's card, I did not feel that I got good value for my money.

First, the atmosphere is inviting and fun! We walked in to see a giant stuffed animal-looking bear beast who had ribbons tied from his head, and bells around his waist dancing around the place. (Turned out he was Kurent- there to chase winter away. I can get behind that mission!!). There was a polka band that was riffing some Jimmy Buffet tunes, and people all over the place! Kids running around and dancing on the dance floor, rows and rows of tables filled with people and all of them with smiling faces! 

Second, the food: we had the Feast and loved it all! There was plenty to go around for everyone, with leftovers to take home. My favorites were the paprikash and Brussels sprouts (amazing!!). Cookies at the end were quite tasty, too.

Third, there was a great beer selection. This makes my husband very happy. They also have a full bar, which makes me  :) 

Fourth, the band stops their music to sing happy birthday if you submit a name of a birthday boy or girl. Ours was a birthday celebration, so we did that and the kids loved it!! 

Fifth, the service is friendly and speedy. Everyone was so great.  We danced, we laughed, we sang, we ate, and we were so merry! What more could you ask for in a night out with friends?

My only negative about the whole experience is that I wished I'd found out about Sterle's sooner! We will be back, and until then are looking forward to it!",2017-03-04 12:57:18

Walking in you'll find a great relaxed atmosphere with plenty of high top seating at the bar, tables and chairs for groups and a massive bean bag to kick back on while playing the first generation Nintendo. Darts and shuffleboard are also offered to challenge your mates.

The Big surprise to this business is out the back, and the window to see where all the beer to made. This is awesome! A must see.


Bad Beat has a great selection of beers that are bold and exciting to truly entertain your taste buds. I enjoyed a awesome flight that had
The Daily Grind - Pale Ale
Ace in the Hole - Basil Pale Ale
Ante Up - Amber Ale
Hoppy Times - IPA
Gunshot - Dry Irish Stout

The other couple we were with are BIG Brazilian BBQ fans and they were really into it, I'm not as big of a fan and wouldn't have chosen it myself, but I was outnumbered as my husband likes these types of establishments as well. However, I did end up enjoying myself a lot more than I thought I would.

We went to Tix4Tonight and got a coupon that basically took off $18 a person for the all you can eat meal...so we paid $3 to get $18 off, a savings of $15 total. That made me feel better as I certainly didn't think I would eat almost $50 worth of meat, so I would definitely suggest doing this deal at Tix4Tonight.

All 4 of us got the all you can eat which includes a salad bar of various offerings like cheese bread rolls (OMG those were REALLY good!), garlic mushrooms, pasta salads, rice, mashed potatoes, etc. It was a nice showing and I enjoyed many of the things offered there. 

They also have ""drink specials"" where you can pay $20 for unlimited beer and wine, $25 for unlimited beer, wine, and sangria, or $30 for unlimited beer, wine, sangria, and caipirhinas. I opted for the $25 and the other 3 opted for the $30. The caipirhina gal pushes a cart around in circles just re-filling as many as she possibly can. She will mix and match any flavors you want using syrups. Real caipirhinas typically used muddled fruit for flavors and not syrups, but since these were all you could drink and she needed to make a lot fast, they cheated and used syrup. This didn't detract TOO much, but for a caipirhina purist, it could be an issue. The service was excellent on all levels all night. We were never without drinks (which made the extra money mostly worth it), meats, or fresh plates. 

The food itself was also good. They had a pretty big choice of different meats that they come around with on skewers cutting you off as much or little as you want. Almost everything we had was very good. Some of the meats come out more or less cooked and you can ask for the ""part"" you want. I myself like my meat well done so I asked for some of the beef well done and they actually went back and cooked me my own plate of well-done beef....nice touch.

While I wasn't thrilled to go here originally I did enjoy myself and my meal. I would not be opposed to going back if others in my group really wanted to go. I just feel like for $35 dollars (or $48 if you pay full price) you have to eat and love A LOT OF MEAT and I'm not a huge ""steak off a stick"" person LOL, but there are lots of people who are and I think if you're that kinda person, you'd love it! :-)",2016-01-17 20:04:38

Trash - a little better this year, I could actually see workers picking up trash, though they seemed to disappear at night.

Culinary - nice representation of local spots. Expected a little more ""famous chef"" spots though. 
The VIP culinary demo area was a little weird. I kinda felt bad for the folks doing the demo there, there just wasn't enough people interested in the VIP area.

Art - Banksy! Art Motel! And some weird circus thingy in the Art Motel.

VIP - I expected more from the VIP area. It was lined with grass, and there was a bar. That's about it. No good views compared with GA, no special perks. Not to mention the people in the Hyde Out kept throwing their drinks at us. Not worth it. 

Music - I enjoyed Death Cab for Cutie, Stevie Wonder, Edward Sharpe, Glass Animals.. When I heard about Insomniac and the Troubadour Stage, all I could think was ""plz don't make this into EDC!"" Thankfully, they contained it to just that stage.

Learning - I didn't stay too long for some of the speakers, but I liked The Venue and the fact that they even have this TEDx-ish thing at the festival. However, like other's have said, they should have given Bill Nye a different venue/area to speak at. It just couldn't accommodate all the people there waiting to see him.

I don't think I'll be going to next year's unless there's a super crazy musician/band I wanted to see.",2015-10-08 03:04:14

They did do it for me afterall, but i wish now they didn't.  They have no business being in the breakfast business. I paid 12 for bfast, incl soup.  I'd say that's pricey, but after they forgot my bacon, they put together a bunch of pieces left over. I had to ask them,  why are you giving me bacon bits? But they just let me take that to the table.

The waitress was really friendly she greeted me promptly and asked what she could get me as if I was a regular. I asked if they still did hot wings and she said why of course 12 for $5. So I ordered them and a cold draft and set back to watch the NFL game in progress. 

The game didn't go my way but the wings came out just perfect as they always have! Hot & crispy with just enough sauce to give them a little bite and not loose the crispiness of the big juicy wings. 

The beer was cold and the shoot of Tequila I had was ample to say the least. Only they don't stock my friend Jose' ...What's up with that so I had some off brand I never heard of call Tres Amigos. It was chilled to the right temperature and slid down easy.

I had no idea LGO was a small group of restaurants originally started in Phoenix. After many, many excellent Misfit meals I decided to eat my way through each of their unique dining experiences back to the original which I believe is LGO Grocery. 

Here, my favorite Kale salad with the awesome grapes sits in a plastic container to go for only $7.50. It doesn't look happy, so I snag one along with an ahi sandwich to share. Eating here could be an adventure, but we missed the lunch rush. Choices are the floor of the grocery, (bad idea), the restaurant which isn't open yet or the 96 degree beautiful day. Hmmm.....the empty restaurant seems logical. Here, I find china, silverware, drinks, glasses, ice, etc and I'm able to correct the presentation of the wonderful kale salad which makes it taste much better! 

The ahi sandwich is a first---I've never seen in in the Pasadena LGO (a completely different concept), or the Luggage Room (also in Pasadena).

LGO Grocery also sells Italian recipe authentic homemade gelato. Incredible! Oh, and did I mention there's a coffee bar with great coffees and a knowledgeable barista! 

Wow, the only thing I missed was the cookies, but the raspberry and espresso gelatos were wonderful as was the entire experience.

As for the store, cute stuff, nice food items and an excellent wine selection. There was a lot of rare Northwest Pinot Noirs, Red Blend and other favorites. Apparently, free corkage during happy hour, too!

Now, I understand the genesis of Misfit and next stop is Chelsea's Kitchen.

So, when my friend told me she wanted a bowling birthday party, I was excited to plan it.  
I was worried that it would be tough to reserve lanes on a Saturday night, but AMF was extremely accommodating.  They allowed me to reserve the 4 lanes we needed in advance with a credit card, no problem.  That way, when the group showed up, our lanes would be together and everyone could pay their own way.  For $5 per game, it was affordable and fun!  We ate before, but I saw several people eating pizza, pretzels, and popcorn from the food stand, and of course, there is a full bar as well!  

We had the lanes from 8 - 10 which worked out perfect.  We brought in a cake and they had no problem with that; they even allowed us to store it in their freezer until we were ready to light the candles, and they supplied us with a knife!

****At 10:00, the bowling alley goes into 'extreme' mode, and it's party time!  The lights dim, the music blares, and big screens come down showing extreme sports while you bowl.  Next time, we'll have to experience that!

I highly recommend changing up your evening activity with a night of bowling every now and then... it's guaranteed fun, and there's no better place than AMF Bowling to do so!",2007-12-11 00:42:01

It was pretty much light and day, and considering this one was an ""Active"" (smaller) and the Trop and Decatur location is a sport, it's a shame how badly managed/used the other one is. Honestly, the people patronizing this club also just seem to be cleaner and more respectful themselves. You know what I mean - not every gym has the same type of crowd. This may be because it's location means that it is used mainly by IRS workers and others that work nearby, as it is not nearly as busy as the centralized clubs.

That being said, it's location is not exactly convenient, and the club itself lacks some machinery and some weights because it is a smaller location. It also lacks much of amenities that you get at the larger locations like a pool or basketball court. However, it is worth noting that  even the locker rooms here are much nicer, with a distinct lack of easy to crack open lockers.

Also note that you can get a 2 hour validation for parking here - necessary because of the $3/halfhour fee in their parking garage.

The bundt cakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes are particularly  (wait for it)..... moist. I wasn't familiar until about a year ago and man oh man, they have since become a fave. The first time I purchased a larger bundt cake for our department celebration and ever lick, every bite was gone. Even those claiming to be on a diet or who didn't like sweets couldn't help but to indulge in this delectable dessert. The time after that I grabbed a dozen of their bundtinis and they're but as good as the full size thing only, they're bite size. I could have eaten at least 6 of them if I didn't have to share. This time we decided to order a bundtlette for each employee in their preference of flavor.

The order consisted of 18 bundtlettes. They are fairly priced at less than $5 per bundlers. I was able to order 4 of one type, 4 of another, 3 of another and a few single selections. The staff member saw the order and wanted to ensure I wasn't celebrating something particular in case I wanted to have the cakes decorated. I thought it was very nice of her to take the time to follow up. Another part of this order was I had been waiting on others to submit their flavor request and didn't get the order in until about 24 hours ahead of time. I was a bit concerned that because I wasn't able to submit the online order longer than 24 hrs ahead that the earliest available was going to cause for alarm. My meeting was scheduled for 11:30 am, and the earliest pick up time was the 11:30-11:45 time block. Well, I decided to go for a stretch and called around 10:10 am and low and behold, they were ready!

I was uber excited and headed right over. They had packed them into a fancy bag for easier carrying and just made my morning. The icing is delicious, you can request extra icing because well, because it's just that good.

We ordered a couple of milkshakes: Brown Cow Float, Oreo, Drunken Monkey, and Campfire Smores. My favorite was the Oreo. The Brown Cow had chocolate pop rocks which made it very unique. It's pricey at ~$11 but they do give you a cup and a half, which makes it feel like a little better deal.

First, let me state that the people were all very friendly and welcoming, and even though I had no appointment on a Friday afternoon, I was seated very quickly.  The atmosphere was pleasant and conditions seemed clean.

My problem is that I am used to a quality pedicure that takes my tough teacher-life beating (on my feet all day, every day, often in sandals). I try to maintain my feet between visits, but delight in a good soak, callous removal and massage.  Even with all the wear and tear, my polish and designs easily last three weeks.  Not so with this pedicure.  I did absolutely nothing different, and within a week, my polish showed wear.  I wasn't offered a design, though I would have paid for one, and my feet felt rough about three days after this visit.  The treatments were okay, and the technician was pleasant; however, the ""massage"" portion of the pedicure (I got the deluxe.) was rather mundane - and that is what I live for on a Friday afternoon after a l-o-n-g week.

My second issue was with face and brow waxing,  I won't go into detail, but my rather thick brows now have to grow out in order to reshape them, some areas were still too thick, and the face waxing  has not lasted long at all.  I attribute some of the inefficiency to the fact that the table for the esthetic procedures was against a wall and the technician had to work from one side.  I also wondered if I had gotten a less-experienced person by default, since it seemed some of the other technicians were with those who appeared to be ""regulars"".

While the cost was not astronomical, it was still higher than I have been paying the past three years for quite a bit better results. 

I am sure this is just a fluke, given the other great reviews; perhaps one day I'll give Riley's another try.",2015-10-24 00:45:30

In defense of hype there are a lot of folks here from the Midwest and Culver's brings back a piece of their past.  I know there are things that if they showed up here from Santa Barbara I would feel the same way.

Friday lunch the place was packed.  There are 3 registers, all in use and the drive through.  I ordered the $4.99 special (double cheese butter burger, fries and a soft drink) and a 2 scoop custard ($2.69?).  They had not had the software loaded to handle the special so they were not advertising it.  The counter person had to find a manager to explain what the special was and how to handle it then had to come back at the end to key in a code with her card.  I asked for everything except mustard, what I got was mayo and onions.  There was a bottleneck at the soda machine which was dispensing ice at about 3 cubes a minute.  I managed to find a seat and about 8 minutes later my food arrived (you place a number on your table and they find you).  The burger was well done to the point of being crunchy around the edges.  The crinkle cut fries were pretty good. 

My order taker asked if I wanted desert after the meal.  This seemed like a good idea so I agreed.  After I finished my meal I went to go get my desert.  I first had to work backwards through the soda backup then, approaching from the other direction, I had to catch the attention of a server between orders.  This while getting stared down by the 20 or so folks standing in line.  I handed in my slip and was given a new number and went back to my table.  I think I would take my chances on the custard softening if I was to eat there during a lunch or dinner rush again, it adds too much time to a lunch run. 

Strawberry cheesecake frozen custard.  That was the flavor of the day.  It came close to rivaling Cold Stone in overall taste quality and for considerably less money.

All the employees I came in contact with were pleasant and helpful.  The new restaurant is of course spotless.  They could have done better designing with how they handle backups at the soda machine and more than a few folks in line, having he line snake into the eating area creates a bit of a bottle neck.  Quite a few booths and tables, many of which can be reconfigured, inside.  There is a good size misted outdoor seating area.",2009-10-21 16:23:30

Many people also interpret art differently than others, so my review is based on the way I review restaurants and services. I based my review on the ambiance of the location, organization of the event, and number of exhibits.I have already given praise to the location, now let's get to the nitty-gritty. If you do decide to visit this festival on weekends, take public transportation, parking in this area is very expensive and hard to come by (even with several pay parking lots). If you are planning to grab something to eat at one of the many great restaurants in the DS, make reservations ahead as wait times without reservations will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours.  As for the festival, there are some very colourful and entertaining exhibits, and I would suggest picking up one of the free maps that are given out at the main entrance. The maps are very good and also give descriptions of the exhibits.  You can see all the exhibits within about 2 hours. I would however, like to see more exhibits (maybe organizers can try and push for more exhibitors in the future.) If you come to this show with an open mind, and want to take in the ambiance of the Distillery District and all its own attractions and take in the light festival as well, chances are you you will be very happy, but if you come here exclusively to just see the events, chances are you would be very happy, but if this event were being held anywhere else other than the DS, I would probably give it a 3 to 3.5 rating.",2018-01-22 19:42:59

Especially the younger ones who don't know and need more hands-on help from parents. The place is too small for what it has, and needs to be more conducive to learning.

Even then it sometimes was spotty service and it was always from the same server. Black hair, really bubbly and friendly which makes her scattered with no priorities except to chat and have fun. 

She's the reason why we always check sauces as it normally isn't always there. I've gotten salad without a dressing or fries without ranch sauce. If we deal with someone else, there's usually not as much issue. 

After last night, screw this place. 

Called in the order and it usually takes 10-15 minutes. The BF gets there soon after to pick it up and lets that server know he's here for a pick up. She goes to the back and says it's a few minutes. He tries to get her several times. It took forever to get the food and when the BF pays and she brings him the food, he asks for sauces that wasn't given. The girl goes off then to drop off a drink, but then goes to chat with some people, and off elsewhere, gets people their checks, etc. before going to just grab the BF some ranch, malt vinegar and tartar sauce. At this point the BF has already been waiting 30minutes plus on a order that was called in 50 minutes ago so he was quite miffed that this lady has no concept of priorities. When a customer is needing to leave, then don't hold them hostage! He sat for a few minutes too many for some sauce.

58 minutes for food. When we open the food- it was cold and soggy. I didn't get tartar sauce for my fish and chips. I live two blocks from this place so it didn't get cold on a travel home. It's the reason why we pick up here- the proximity should get us hot food. 

The food was done probably the timeframe they said, but that lady didn't go get the food and wandered around chatting up people.

We had no intentions of going out to eat but we got sort of hungry and it happened to be close by. We've walked by a handful of time while stopping in the wine and spirits next door but never really think to try it.

I'm not a huge wing person so I lucked out when I saw they had boneless wings. They have about 30-40 wing flavors if I had to estimate. All of which sounded delicious. Being that it was our first time we wanted to go somewhat basic just to scope it out. I've had terrible buffalo sauces so believe it or not that alone can give me all the information I need to know about a place. We got one order of buffalo mild and one of the honey bbq. 

Our wings came out covered in sauce which was already a great sign. I hate food that isn't saucy enough. Sauce gives food flavor so let's not be stingy. We absolutely loved the buffalo wings. I will say for a mild buffalo it had some heat so depending on you heat tolerance be mindful of that. The bbq however wasn't my favorite. It was very bland in my opinion and the sauce was thick. Almost ""goopy"" if that's even a word. 

In addition to the wings we got a order of Mac n cheese bites and spicy fried pickles. The Mac n cheese bites were every bit as amazing as I expected. The fried pickles however were not. Far too much breading on them and they weren't spicy at all. All the breading took away from the taste of the pickle.


All in all I would recommend Wiggy's to someone who enjoys wings. The actual wings looked a lot better than the boneless.

euIvgjs9VjIKicYVuVJACQ,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,fQwB9Z98YEhkJit7c3z51A,3,4,0,2,"The Carbon Bar (TCB), is the newest venture from the same owners as Nota Bene.  Quality food is what these two restaurant have in common;  Nota Bene serves up haute cuisine and TCB serves up ""haute""  Southern cuisine with a more casual and fun vibe.

The restaurant is located at Queen + Church; it has housed Electric Circus and was also once a Disney rehearsal studio.  Remnants from its predecessors take form of a neon light beaming the word Electric and some Donald Duck figurines as well as sound boards, which serve as wall décor where the washrooms are located.  

The overall look and feel of the place is that of a vintage diner, with burgundy colored booth seats that fill the open space.  The open kitchen draws much attention as does the bar which are at opposite extremes of the restaurant.  If you raise your head slightly, you'll see an elevated platform/balcony that is reminiscent of where the banker sits à la ""Deal or No Deal"" - that's where the 30-seater private dining area is.  Plenty of privacy.


Executive chef David Lee is seen mentoring his staff hands-on while the abundance of serving staff trickle in and out of the kitchen like a colony of ants.

IMG_2101 (480x640)The wine list by the glass is regrettably short, but solid.  Wine by the bottle comes in three tier pricing ($39, $59 and $79).  There's a good mix of import versus domestic.  There are also currently 8 beers on tap.    We opt for the cocktail list and decide on two Carbon originals (nice juxtaposition of words here) - the Deal Closer ($14), a tequila-infused concoction with campari, cardamom and ginger beer  and the Risk and Reward ($14), a mix of spiced rum, Aperol + Amaro Montenegro.


We opt for the Crisp Chicken Skins ($6) for the same reason why I love chicken wings - the fat is in the skin which = flavor!  These dehydrated crisps unfortunately do not have the same allure and are pretty bland on their own.  Thank God for the sweet chili vinegar?  Not so much - it too does not provide the flavor boost I so desperately wanted either.

Redemption is found in this Cabrito Papusa ($13), tender goat meat stuffed in a masa tortilla,
with tomatillo salsa + guajillo date jus.  The masa tortilla knocked it out of the park as it was crispy and light (almost reminiscent of the texture of a deep-fried taro dumpling you get at dim sum).  One of my favorite dishes of the night.

The kitchen then sends out the Hamachi ($14) on the house, a tartare with clementine, pear, kombucha vinegar and little Peruvian red peppers (Gandules) which add a splash of color to brighten up the whole dish.  The sweetness from the fruits and peppers are a great contrast, both texturally and flavor-wise.

For mains we opt for the Pork Ribs ($18) - the simplest test of whether or not you need to try anything else from the pit.  The pink smoke ring seems promising, and the texture is spot on (albeit being greasy).  Flavor-wise however, the ribs are lacking and the overly tangy sauce doesn't come to the rescue.

From the à la carte sides we order the signature TCB Slaw ($6) topped with corn nuts which was genius!  Not overly dressed and very refreshing.  We also order the ""Hot Mess"" ($11), a sweet potato topped with cheese curds, crema, chopped brisket and pickled jalapeno - the rather bland crema overwhelms most of the flavor and my mind starts wandering to thoughts of a loaded baked potato.

The kitchen again, sends out another dish, this time, a sample of the Goat Ribs ($18), which are usually only available on Fridays.  The goat ribs just look intimidating, garnering fears of meat sweats to ensue but no worries, but it's just the sheer size of the bones that carry on the illusion.  Once you bite into it, it kind of makes you wish that the illusion was fake as it is extremely tender and juicy and for me, even better than the pork ribs.

We then feast on the Oak Fired Octopus ($21), a gumbo unlike any other.  While most gumbos I've encountered are a brownish bowl often imperceptible and slimy, you can see  the chunks of lobster sausage, and hominy corn.  And the okra isn't slimy at all.  Definitely a winner.

We muster up the stomach space for dessert and decide to forego the ice-cream themed goodies for the Banana Toffee Cream Pie ($12) which feeds 2.  I love bananas, but this pie just fell short of expectations.  The cream to banana ratio was largely skewed and if there was any toffee in the pie it was drowned out in the bubble bath of cream that covered the pie.  It should've been more aptly labelled - cream pie.

Not comparing apples to oranges, I enjoyed TCB much better than Nota Bene.  I can just let down my hair and have fun here and the menu is much more exciting!",2014-01-17 20:03:41

Totally realizing we're being difficult, we apologized a bunch and the staff was cool about it. We had the special which is AMAZING! On mon tues they have a bruscetta board and any bottle of house wine for 20 bucks! 20 BUCKS! The board alone is 15. This is a fantastic deal! They also have gluten free bread which was great for Boston. We also got the Bounty which had a ton of fresh veggies (cauliflower, brussels, carrots, radishes) that were grilled and an almond hummus and some spicy almonds. Really great. Alaska got a mixed green salad with pears, grapes and crunchy leaks and a poppy seed dressing. She loved it! Two girls opted to get another glass ($9 each)but didnt realize that we could take the rest of the bottle home and the bruschetta! The bartender really went above and beyond to do this. We asked her after she brought the for the 2 glasses and she'd originally said no but made it happen eventually. My only complaint was the gf bruschetta was soft and my bread tasted a little stale and it was super loud. There really is no reason to have music up that high.

They are members of the range and are able to frequent this location with their monthly subscription. Truly appreciated them bringing me along with them to try this range out. This range will let you try out different weapons with a paid membership which is awesome for those who want to experience/practice with firearms before purchasing a new one. The guy at the register was not my favorite. No personality whatsoever, had longer hair, but unfortunately I didn't catch his name. I think it was GARBAGE that they limited my friends and I to 45 minutes in the range. These people pay every single month and were basically told that other walk in customers were more important, so they had to limit their time. What is the point of a subscription then? They need to work on a better system because a 45 minute time restriction for paid members is ridiculous. This place kind of seems like a tourist trap due to its' location in the vicinity of the strip, so beware.

Seriously THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I personally experienced was the humbling realization that I can't even handle ""mild"" spice. I cried a little bit. Inside and out. Yet, it didn't stop me because the food was so good anyway. 

Go in knowing this place is going to be a mess. The establishment itself is pretty nice and they do a good filtration job not to make it smell like a sea food market to my surprise. But you are given a dorky looking bib for a simple reason... you're going to need it.

We got ourselves a full pound of shrimp, an order of potatoes, and three orders of corn on the cob paired with two blue moons to drink and cups of water to drink on. It costed us barely $40. That was not a bad night. 

Now, for the recommendation... get ""The Whole Shebang"" flavoring. It is nearly impossible not to be satisfied with your choice. It was FANTASTIC. The potatoes we weren't all that excited about. They were just potatoes. But the corn on the cob saturated in that flavor was to die for. The shrimp comes in that natural state where you have to physically peel all the shell off yourself but it is amazing none the less.  So so good. You can choose your grade of spice between 1-4. I chose a #2 (mild) and I was hurting. Granted, I'm accountably a bag of wuss. So find out for yourself, don't take my word for it. 

If you're of age, get a beer with it. It pairs really well with the experience and takes some of the fire away from your mouth, which was a nice saving grace. 

I will end note this with the fact that we went on a Monday in the early evening (around 6pm or so), and there was not much of a line at all but I have left this place several attempts because the line is SUPER long and they don't take reservations over the phone. It's kind of a first come first serve kind of thing. Which on one end, I get. But from a guest perspective... come on lol. Consider it. It will make most of your guests very happy, I promise.

Their hiring process must include a Plinko Board. 

Bottom Line First: Buffalo Wild Wings has boring food that apparently takes 12 minutes per wing to prepare, a crap beer selection, which is way over prices,  and customer service training comparable to the Nevada Highway Patrol. 

If you like wings, don't eat here.
If you like your friends and family, don't bring them here.

My next Yelp! List will be PLACES THAT ARE BETTER THAN BUFFALO WILD WINGS.

I have been to this Buffalo Wild Wings about 20 times in the last few years. My friends in the area love it, so we go frequently. Every time we visit this location, everything goes wrong. 

I came here for a friend's birthday party and I kept my mouth shut while in the restaurant as to not create a scene. 

Our table waited 50 minutes for the wrong food to come out twice. I ordered to go, as I had to leave the party for work. I even paid when I ordered. Our server, shorted my  change and still stressed that gratuity was not included in my total. I didn't make a big deal over it. Every time she came over, she said that mine should be right out. I wanted to cancel it, but again, did not want to make a scene.

I pointed out a bag that had been sitting by the register for 20 minutes. It turns out that this WAS my order. She had it remade, which made me really uncomfortable. 

She tried to make a joke out of it, not understanding how difficult it is for me to not be mean sometimes. She did not offer to refund the food cost or offer anything additional either, she just said ""well you have somewhere to be, so get out of here.""

The food, which I had to eat on my rushed drive was spilled all over the bag and was not hot. The napkins in the bag were soaked from the spilled sauce. It was the typical, half-assed Buffalo Wild Wing garbage food with no veggie sides.

We arrived at 4:45 to beat the rush but I didn't anticipate the senior citizen rush that had started at 4:30, so it was crowded.  We waited about 10 min in line for food but I was prepared with my order and cash so it went smoothly enough.  The dining room was PACKED no lie.  There were a few open tables but only in corners upstairs where you couldn't see the organist, so what would be the point?  We finally found 3 people sitting at an 8 person table near the stage who were nice enough to share with my son and me.  Honestly, all the people there seemed really nice; they were mostly older and smiled and laughed at my son when he was being his exuberant self during the music.  I was pretty astonished at how well he behaved.

It took about 20 min after we sat down for our food to be ready - small pizza, basket of fried zucchini, mushrooms, and mozzarella, and small salad.  I thought the food was good, not amazing but better than some of the other posters made it sound.  The salad bar was very basic and definitely the low point of our meal, but at $2.99 not a huge deal.  My son enjoyed his pizza, so if he eats - I'm happy.

The organist was fantastic!  Some of the songs he played were that Dancing Cats song with the puppets (my son was mesmerized), theme from Star Wars (my fave), A Wonderful World, some kind of Choo Choo train song, Abba, etc.  There was also a set of patriotic songs played for soldiers in the audience which I thought was cool.

Service was good, very friendly and nice.

The biggest cons were the size and the temperature. I got there early so I was able to secure a spot at the bar but outside of that, there were three small table for maybe four, and a group of eight sitting together and that's all there was room for.

This is a nice drinking place especially if you come after 9pm for their Sapporo special ($3 for a Pint). It's an Izakaya which the servers greets the customers in Japanese when entering or leaving the place. The place is dimly lit and music is played at a level in which you can still carry a conversation with people without screaming at them. There are Bar rows or booths where you can sit. 

Along with our beverages, we ordered their Tuna Plate, 12 pcs. Salmon Sashimi and the fried calamari. I think their food is above average as there's nothing extraordinary about it but is not the worst you ever had neither. However, even with their specials, prices are a bit high with the amount of food that you get. However, you do get a complimentary dish and yesterday we got a Green Bean Tempura. 

The service was very good. Attentive and quick even though the place was packed. Also, the servers did well in explaining the dishes to us. 

Overall, it was a good experience and will be back for their drinks specials.

In my personal opinion in a diner as empty as this one was on a Saturday Night 8/9/14 at 9pm how could splitting a check for majority couples be that much of an inconvenience?! I did not nor will I ever understand why an establishment could be so unreasonable.

All their energy and efforts go into making a flavorful, juicy, fat burger. The fat content in this burger is superb -although I don't know the actual percentage of fat. Just know that the burger juice will run down your arm. 

The burgers are dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions (ask for grilled), pickles, relish, and mustard. For an additional cost, you can add-on eggs, cheese, bacon, onion rings, or chili. While most fast-food establishments only offer beef burgers, Fatburger has always had turkey burgers on the menu too. They've even included vegetarian patties and glutten-free buns.

The burger sizes range from small to XXXL. For some reason, the small fat is no longer on the drive-thru menu - but it's still available. 

The sides range from onion rings to skinny fries to fat fries and even chili cheese fries. I personally think it's silly for anyone to come to FATburger and get SKINNY fries. My go-to are the fat fries or the onion rings. There's also hand-scooped shakes, but they are not my favorites. Plus, the burger and fries alone will keep you pretty satisfied.

When we arrived the line moved quickly because there were several people spaced out along the entrance doing separate jobs. First came the pat down, then the ID checks for those who want to drink and finally the ticket scanning. I think this made everything move faster because the people at the front reminded patrons to have the tickets out and ready several times before they were needed.

As soon as you enter there is a bar on the right with a large selection and typical painful venue prices. Then there is a path all the way around the stage that the bouncers kept clear the whole night. I would love if bars did this! Whenever I wanted to move to another area (bar, bathroom, outside) I had minimal crowd swimming to do before I was free and clear to move about the open walkway. We spent our time at the raised deck in the back. View was a little removed but it meant we could see over everyone's head which I thought was better.

The only two downsides were that cleared the outside area abruptly before the night ended. We had gone out to cool off for a moment and then were sent almost immediately back inside in a brisk manner. The second downside was that even though there were several bars service was slow.

The pork belly is nice and tender and the gyoza tastes standard. I have to say these eggs are 5/6ths done which might be the way they do it but I prefer a runny yolk.
The ramen is unique and not like other broths at the other chains. The clam broth is prominent and when mixed with the onions and truffle paste, you can an indescribable umami taste. It's interesting because I believe ramen broth is usually pork bone or chicken stock.

This Friday's is quite different than most.  Gone are the red & white striped awnings and, in their place, are rows of Dbacks and other baseball memorabilia lining the walls.   If you are a baseball fan, you will love this place simply because of the decor.  If that wasn't enough, you get to enjoy the signs and sounds of a major league baseball game (81 days of the year) and the field itself for every other day.  All in all, a pretty nice setup.

This Friday's does tend to be priced a bit higher than others in the area.  The service is also much slower.  Also, if you are watching the Dbacks play, you may lose your appetite.",2008-12-16 16:19:04

The chicken wasn't very memorable.

The udon, made in house.  Thick, glutinous, toothsome, springy, slippery, neutral flavored noodles in a dried fish based broth.  Gentle umame from the natural glutamates of konbu add a hint of smokiness, soy sauce the requisite salinity.  A sprinkle of green onion and tempura flakes.  Kake udon.  Done.

Definitely a good bowl of udon but at $7?   70% higher than expensive Hawaii and nearly double typical Japan prices.  Still, cheap eats by anyone's standards.

Variations sampled included a kakuni (tender but over braised pork in sweetened soy sauce), duck (simply seasoned, cooked medium well with properly rendered fat), and beef (thinly shaved, hint of soy, overcooked)  udon.  Adding the small amount of protein makes for a more complete meal but the hot broth rapidly overcooks the proteins.  If meat is what you need, order them as a starter and a basic kake udon.  The broth is the same and the proteins will be properly cooked without adding an oil slick to the broth.
 
That said, neither the duck, kakuni, or beef tataki are that special though no complaints.

Cold udon, emphasizes the texture of the udon, a very good, somewhat citrusy dipping sauce.  Refreshing.  

The piece de resistance, uni cream udon with extra uni.  Orgasmic!  Heavy cream flavored with smashed uni, envelopes the udon.   The pile is topped by a shisho, more whole uni and ikura.   Warm, creamy, oceanic in all the right ways.  The cold topping adds a fresh boost of oceanic brininess.  Whoops!  Ahhhhh.... TMI.

The chicken salad had a ton of chicken and not a lot of lettuce. The quality of the chicken was great and very flavorful. All in all, good dish. 

The beef on the taco and burrito needed some seasoning. It was kind of bland. The portions of all the dishes were very good. The taco was the size of a Taco Bell taco, but was $2. 

I saw the meats go on the grill raw which made me happy. It wasn't sitting there all day! 

It was $13 for the 3 items so that's not too bad considering the portions. We will try different dishes, but so far it wasn't anything ""out of this world"". It's nice they have a drive thru and it's open 24 hours.

zzryaRmYDGBH1JzmjRgQKQ,fhNSa1szPhXYvtcGzPXLiw,hTdJAjSZtHWwqqh5cCeAfA,4,0,0,0,"It had been quite some time since I ate at any Red Lobster restaurant however when there was a special deal on Red Flag Deals and from what we were told a brand new menu with four new entrée combos, then a visit to this long time establishment was definitely warranted.  We decided to go there on a weeknight thinking that it would be quieter however when we got there around 6:30pm and without reservations, we were surprised at the amount of people standing at the door waiting to get in.  The place was packed and there were people actually leaving because they were told that the wait was going to be 45 minutes long.  We were fortunate however because despite getting the same message, we were given a table within ten minutes of waiting. 

Scanning their brand new menu, we decided to go with a few of their new combos including the Ultimate Feast, Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops and the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake.  We also got ourselves a Red Lobster Signature Pizza and the Lobster Crab and Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms.

I personally had the Ultimate Feast myself which consisted of an Atlantic coast lobster tail, snow crab legs, garlic shrimp scampi and Walt's Favorite Shrimp.  The lobster tail was made to perfection.  With its juicy buttery sauce to dip it in, the lobster tail was succulent from the first bite to its last. The lobster meat literally fell right off the shell and was tender all the way through.  The crab legs were perfectly steamed.  As an added bonus, not only was there plenty of meat in the crab legs itself, but there was plenty of meat near the body where are the crab legs were held together.  The garlic shrimp was my personal favorite although it was probably quite fattening to the average person.  The shrimp was immersed in hot melted garlic butter sauce and there were about 8 pieces of wonderful tasty shrimps inside its bowl.  The shrimps were all fresh and nicely de-shelled from head to tail.  Lastly Walt's Favorite shrimp was actually shrimp placed in deep fried batter and served to us hot and crunchy.  The shrimp was great and I certainly had no complaints with them.  Personally I would have loved it had they fried in coconut beer batter.  That to me is my all time favorite with deep fried shrimp. 

The Wood Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops were all grilled to perfection.  The scallops were nice and tender and had a good bounce to them.  All the seafood was cooked to perfection and there was plenty of rice and broccoli to go with the seafood.  There was again a small bowl of melted butter that went well with the seafood.  This was a wonderful entrée especially for those who didn't want an all-seafood plate. 

 The Bar Harbor Lobster Bake was probably one of the most filling entrées on the menu and if you are super hungry, this was one entrée that one should go and order.  The seafood on top consisted off lobster tail, shrimps, scallops and mussels and this was placed on top of a large amount of linguini on the bottom.  Watching our friend eat it was exhausting as there was a lot of seafood and pasta to consume.  Needless to say, not all of it was eaten and what was left over was doggied-bag home that evening. 

The Lobster Crab and Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms were a combination of broccoli, rice and cheese stuffed inside the mushrooms. The mushrooms were then immersed in white Cheddar cheese and baked to a nice golden brown color.  The cheesy flavored mushrooms were fantastic.  The cheesy mixture was quite similar to ones that were used by other restaurants where seafoods like escargots and mussels were mixed with similar cheesy sauces.  Despite the amount of stuffing inside the mushrooms and the amount of cheese on the outside, one did not feel bloated or stuffed after eating this dish, which is good considering the amount of seafood one would have to consume later in the evening.   

The Red Lobster Signature Pizza was a thinly crusted pizza topped with lobster meat, melted cheese, fresh tomatoes and sweet basil.  Texture and appearance wise it appeared to be just a simple pepperoni pizza except the pepperoni was substituted with lobster meat.  I personally enjoyed the novelty however I would prefer pizza with the pepperoni.  The lobster didn't really provide any extra taste to the pizza and with the lack of pepperoni in it, it almost made the pizza somewhat bland.  If you are a huge fan of thin crusted pizzas, then this pizza is for you as the bottom was almost paper thin. 


Overall, it was certainly a night not to count one's calories or cholesterol.  The food was really good right to the very last bite.  My own thinking was that even though I have not stepped in a Red Lobster in quite sometime, most of the food that was presented was something I had seen and eaten before.  Still, the food was great and it was good to get reacquainted with a great restaurant.",2017-02-20 23:04:38

They have a few tables for dine-in but I gather that many of their customers actually order take-out -- it must be so convenient for those living in the nearby apartments to grab a quick afternoon or late-night snack here.

We ordered the Original Large Fried Chicken in Salt and Pepper seasoning.  We also ordered a serving of their Popcorn Chicken (my favourite) and a serving of their Fried King Oyster Mushrooms.

It did take about ten minutes for our order to be ready.  It's nice that they prepared it fresh, I guess.

The Original Large Fried Chicken cutlet wasn't as large as I remembered it to be when I had it in Hong Kong (and when I had it in Hong Kong, it was actually the smaller version of the Large size too).  K was also underwhelmed with the size too.  It was still crispy though when we ate it.  It was the same taste-wise as I remembered with the crispy battered skin falling away from the chicken breast meat, which was moist and very tender.  When I ate it in my hands, it almost felt like I was eating a chicken skin-chicken meat-chicken skin sandwich.  XD  I still enjoyed it though because the chicken meat was moist and tender.

Oh, when we got to the end part of the chicken, we realized that it wasn't a pure piece of chicken breast; there were actually bones!  They had squished the chicken so that you could see the rib cage and bones too.  This was definitely different from the pure chicken meat cutlet that I had had in Hong Kong.

The Popcorn Chicken serving cost $6.99 and for that price, I thought that there were very few pieces inside the paper packet. :/  Taste-wise, it was delicious.  The Popcorn Chicken morsels were crispy too and seasoned heavier than the large piece of fried chicken.  I really enjoyed this and the Popcorn Chicken was definitely to my liking.  )I get very particular about Popcorn Chicken. :))  But when it comes to the price, I can't see myself ordering this again for so few pieces.

The Fried King Oyster Mushrooms were $4.99 for one serving and also didn't contain that many pieces.  I really enjoyed the taste too!  The Fried King Oyster Mushrooms were cut into chunky pieces that weren't too battered but full of seasoning.  Yummy!",2017-10-27 17:40:40

You will find me here most weeekdays with my laptop enjoying the free WIFI and some yummy food. This place tends to confuse people, so here is the deal. La Grande Orange is owned by the ever so easy on the eyes Craig DeMarco. He also owns Postino Wine Cafe (2 locations), La Grande Orange Pizzeria and Radio Milano in the valley in addition to a few in California.

First of all the Grocery or LGO is not really a Grocery. It is a self-serve restaurant featuring Breakfast and Lunch all day. In addition they sell lots of Wine, Specialty Grocery items and lots of stuff you never knew you needed. Once you get your food you may sit outside or at the few inside tables or you may also sit in the Pizzeria side till 4pm. This is where it gets fuzzy. On Fridays you can also order Pizza in the Grocery starting at noon  and eat it in the Pizzeria until 4pm. At 4pm they start full service and then you have to be seated and are waited on. Confusing to newbies, but it works. 

This place is full of regulars. Mostly business types, Self Employed or others than can take a 2-3 hour lunch. They have WIFI and so people come and get some work done while having a bite and there are always several tables with casual meetings or get togethers. It is a comfortable inviting place once you know the drill. My only beef is they don't serve Breakfast Alcoholic drinks like Bloody Marys or Mimosas, but I would never leave if they did, so all is well, Try their Havana Latte, Croque Madame, San Danielle Special Sandwich, any Salad...

I ate here last night with a group of 6 friends.  We had a reservation and were seated at the first table near the entrance. We started with a round of drinks.  I had the Oh So Gingerly which pairs ginger with Maker's Mark.  They were all great, though took perhaps 20 minutes to arrive.  We shared a few appetizers, which were delicious, often served with sauces that complemented them quite well, though one plate failed to appear (and did not until we asked about it later, finally coming with our dinners).  We continued to eat, wondering if we could get water refills, seeing managers and servers walk by over and over without stopping.  

Finally, 1.5 hours in, appetizers long gone, we were able to place our dinner orders.  When the dishes arrived, I confirmed with the man distributing the plates that mine was what I had ordered - ""Mee Goreng?"" and he said that it was.  Several bites in, my friend and I realized that we were eating each other's meals.  Again, everything was delicious, but we always seemed to need to flag someone down to proceed to the next stage of the meal.  Of course, being rushed is no fun either, and to be fair, we were a group of friends enjoying each other's company and not in any particular hurry, but it became quite frustrating. At one point we wondered if our server had finished for the night, because we did not see him for so long. 

The dessert menu, too, is full of a variety of tasty things impeccably presented.  All our selections were enjoyed.  Our check came with an 18% gratuity added, and it was nice to not to have to think about how to tip for the good food we'd had, and the spotty service.  There is a lot of potential here, and hopefully the staff will refine their approach.

P. S. This is petty, but I also can't trust any place that does their menu in Comic Sans.",2010-01-09 19:39:30

Ok, so I like it here.  Free wifi, cute layout, indoor and outdoor seating.  Seating is limited, in the sense that its a lot of two tops or a few 4 tops, but nothing for a larger group, like lets say a random study group or whatnot.

They serve pastries, and I purchased one.  The girl at the counter said that the WIFI was free, but they wanted you to make a purchase, which is a reasonable request.  The drinks, in comparison, are priced more at a starbucks level, from staring at the menu.  prepare to spend $4 on a mocha, and $2.50-$4 on a pastry.  

It is quiet in here, no music. But, some people need that, and if I was studying, I would want it quiet in here as well.  

This seems like a great little spot.  I have not tried the coffee, yet, but its SO much better then getting starbucks!  The girl who helped me behind the counter seemed to know her stuff.   I like that in a good coffee shop-staff who know thier stuff!

What I do NOT like about this place is the lack of bathrooms.  There is one bathroom, but you have to physically cut through the ""backroom area"" which is ugly and unkept looking.  Its kind of like back in the old days when you were a kid and had to cut through the stock room at the grocery store to get to the bathrooms. I was not impressed with the bathroom situation, and even though the bathroom was clean, I didn't like the fact that I felt like I was using a staff bathroom.  Not cool.

Well, at least it's a good workout for me!

Our first foray in teaching me a little bit of control over the ball occurred at the Lakewood Park tennis courts.  Four courts available with artificial surface.  There was another pair playing when we arrived on a blustery afternoon, but I can imagine that when the weather warms up a bit that there will be people waiting to get on a court.

The rest of the park looks well used (in a good way!), there was a ton of kids in the skateboard park when we were playing and a lot of little ones in the playground when we arrived.  The pool looks like it's a great size and I'm sure the lifeguards will be kept busy with children in the summer....although the amount of children is one of the reasons I probably won't be taking a dip in the (yellow) pool water  ;o)

Without seeing the reviews on the internet, I probably would have never given this place a chance. Very clean setting on the inside with very friendly staff. They had a pretty good menu that had dishes outside of Sweet N Sour Chicken. They actually had some more authentic style dishes including Chow Fun, Mapo Tofu and various seafood dishes. We tried a pretty basic lineup of Mongolian Beef and Emperors Chicken. If you know anything about Chinese food, you're probably familiar with the ""smokey, grilled"" taste that you get from the wok. The beef had this taste. It was authentic. 

Check in with Yelp and they'll give you a free half order of Crab Puffs (5) which were amazing by the way. Such a simple and common dish, but this place had one of the best I've had. 

If you're into vegetables, they have some pretty good selections. They're pretty pricey though (not uncommon at Chinese restaurants). We ordered the seasonal Sauteed Chinese Vegetables; market price was about 10 bucks.

If you want to spend a leg and an arm, you should definitely check out Chubby Cattle! It's clean, new and the ""restaurant"" that everyone is talking about these days. Unfortunately, we had a mixed review about this place. First of all, we didn't order a dish and another server delivered it to our desk and got frustrated when we said it wasn't ours. Our original server came to check on us and he apologized profusely for the mistake. The other server just walked away with attitude and mumbled something in Chinese back to the kitchen. I wasn't uncomfortable with that. 

Again, this is a Asian restaurant so I knew I had to expect sometime of stereotypical service, right? After we got our broth, my partner's heater didn't turn on and struggled to heat up for at least 15-20 minutes. No, I'm seriously not exaggerating. I felt so bad because he had to wait for his soup to boil. He couldn't use mines because he didn't like spicy. Poor guy. 

For our main dishes, we got the beef and lamb combo for each of us and a bowl of mushrooms to share. We sat across from the conveyer belt too and it was fun to pick and choose bowls to eat. This was awesome since I grabbed a lot of the seafood dishes from here, which were amazing by the way!

I loved it!! The ponzu sauce for the cold noodle was very citrus and just right. I'm wondering if they are making the homemade ponzu at their place instead of using the sauce from the bottle :) The hint of sesame oil was really blended into the dish and I was happy with the amount of the vegetables that they served with the noodle. 

The chashu is a popular topping for the ramen, but I wanted to try with my rice this time. The chashu bowl comes with several piece of fried pork, chopped dried seaweed, and chopped green onion on top of rice. It was sooooo good!  I think I am sometimes very superstitions.

   This is an upscale modern Mexican restaurant, nice hip marble top bar and some very nice original art pieces throughout the restaurant. A nice patio area with rattan furniture and giant parasols for a nice outdoor dining experience.

  Sat at the bar and service was decent. This time I got the espada (swordfish) tacos and the ceviche mixto, both items were on the miniature size but the flavors were grande! not enough to fill me up but just enough to be satisfied. Can't wait to try so many other options on the menu that sounded very promising. 

  Back to value..It is kind of odd sitting at the bar at a Mexican restaurant order some drinks and not being offered chips and salsa, and even though cheap food shouldn't be expected here, with prices being a little bit over the comfort zone for tacos throwing in some complimentary chips and salsa shouldn't kill you, but skimping might, besides no restaurant ever in the history of Mexican restaurants ever charged extra for salsa! That's like the taco law, free salsa for all tacos.

Last week, actually back up... a few additional weeks prior to that when my sister and I were in the area, I had seen Hot Beans but wasn't feeling like it was a burrito-or-Mexican-inspired-food kinda day, you know it has to be that kind of day where you feel like eating what you are about to. 

So last week I went in and bought myself a black bean burrito with guacamole... no. 1: 10 bucks for a burrito... what an incredible price, for the size you get! I haven't been to Chipotle on Yonge since they've opened, to recall what their price point was like, to have somewhat of a comparison. But Hot Beans is incomparable to Chipotle because Hot Beans is vegan and therefore rules and to a large extent may induce drooling! (remember the old saying, when something rules, the other thing drools? Well, this place happily contains both ruling and drooling!) 

Also, no. 2: I am part South American and avocados are, try to have them be, a staple in my diet. And a solidly ripe avocado is extremely important to me. Thus following, this place delivered on a satisfying lunch because their guacamole is made of fresh, RIPE avocados. No. 3: The service was exceptionally fast, could've been a little friendlier, but I wasn't in that mood that day so not a lot of chit-chat was exactly what I needed! Thank you to the young man on the other side of the counter for that!

I will most likely be returning to try more of their delicious menu items and I am in absolute anticipation until then.

I love the architecture that dates back to Confederation. I could spend all night exploring the different rooms and studying the intricacies of the banister carvings. But clearly this isn't a review site for architecture but for FOOD!

While the wait on a Saturday night (the only night they do not take reservations) was a bit long, the wait was between 1 hour 15 minutes - 1 hour 30 minutes, honestly it was 7:15pm on a Saturday night, I expected this. We got a little pager (fyi it doesn't work outside) and went to the bar, which was equally rammed and got a drink. We managed to snag the window seat, located between the first and second flight of stairs. Had our drink and proceeded to wait. 

Approximately 25 minutes into our wait a nice lady came up to us with a platter of sample appetizers and I got to try the most delicious crab mixture on a crispy flat bread...YUM! Ok so now that my thirst and a bit of my hunger was quenched, another server came along and asked if we wanted to order appetizers, in any other case I would have totally said yes but I was waiting as my hunger had been temporarily satisfied.

By a little after 8pm, we were seated. Not a bad guesstimation hostess lady friend. Our server named Kevin, who bore a striking resemblance to our lovely CM Vivek, quickly came by and greeted us and took our water preference. Honestly, I can't say anything bad about this server, he was prompt and came and checked on us at the perfect times, although there was one somewhat long stretch in which I didn't see him at all, but I'm just nit picking now because I didn't require his service. What really sealed it in for me was at one point, my partner and I were in an intense part of a conversation (don't worry it wasn't arguing) but he took note of this and decided that it would be better if he didn't interrupt on this particular moment...5 STAR RATING FOR KEVIN!!!!

What can I say about the food, it was Keg-tastic. Prime rib was cooked to perfection, I ordered rare and was informed by wonderful Kevin that it may come medium rare as they may not have that cut but it came rare and it was delicious! I asked for my veggies to be simply blanched as I did not enjoy having garlic or butter on them and they came naked! 

Now let's get to the best part and the main reason that I decided to come to the Keg. The BILLY MINER PIE!!!!!!!!!!!! I seriously come here just to have dessert. The mocha ice cream atop of an oreo cookie crumb crust, drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce with almond shavings..... *DROOOOOOOOLLL* I enjoyed this dessert so much that my neighbour said, ""Excuse me, but what is that you are eating?!"" with the most curious look on his face. People might've have thought that I achieved Moksha or something! I never have to look at the dessert menu at the Keg, I actually don't even know what else they serve but I don't care, because the Billy Miner Pie seriously satisfies every one of my cravings.

Thank you Keg Mansion for scaring the crap out of me, we decided to read about how it was haunted while waiting and for providing me with wonderful stories to tell another day.",2010-11-23 00:41:04

But I gotta say, I've been here twice - with a good enough span of time in between both times, and I've been disappointed twice now.

This was close to closing time, but still before, and though normally I would not want to keep people, I figured a small business such as JP Pancake could use the patronage.

At any rate - the last time I went, I ordered french toast - and what I got, I could have made better myself at home. Two tiny, flat pieces of toast, with hardly any flavor and forget presentation. Service was poor as the people waiting and cooking were unattentive and slow - not just to us but in terms of cleaning the tables of patrons who had already left. We walked in and it was litterally, find a table that wasn't strewn with dirty plates and glasses. It was not a pleasant site. And, just as we had been turned away the previous time we had attempted to visit this establishment, we watched them turn away an elderly man about 15 minutes to close.

It was just a bummer - I'm not sure who enjoys this place when literally right down the street is a fantastic breakfast place over and Hayden and Via de Ventura.

The buns are pretty standard but toasted, at least, which is nice.  I tried one of the regular burgers just to be sure, and it confirmed that it's really the special sauce that masks the burger's shortfalls and turns it into something that is pretty decent.  The Potato Teezers side was pretty good--very cheesy with just a little bit of jalapeno kick in each stick.

I tried Swensons based on an argument with a friend while we were chowing down on my beloved Cook-Out burgers in North Carolina (at about 3:00am on Saint Patrick's Day to fully set the scene).  The burgers at Swensons are a long way from that rarefied air in my opinion, and I would put them also behind In-n-Out, Five Guys, and Culver's among the national/regional chains I've tried.  Still, the Galley Boy at Swensons is a decent enough special sauce burger, and it's fun to watch the runners zip back and forth from the kitchen to the cars in the parking lot.  Now excuse me while I try to clean the crumbs out of my car.",2012-04-01 04:47:27

Since they were known for their meatloaf - I ordered that. The mashed potatoes that came with the meatloaf tasted sour as if it was sitting out and went bad or if they used old milk/sour cream. We also got two kids meal for $9.99 each for some prepackaged burger patties. Mac N Cheese was not cheesy at all.

I ordered the #6 Combination Plate (which is as follows: grilled chicken burrito with pico de gallo, beans, guacamole, cheese smothered with Hatch Chile sauce and topped with sour cream) with only rice and my date got the #6 Combination Plate (which is: three Carne Asada tacos with onion, cilantro, tomatillo salsa) with rice and beans.

While we were waiting for our food, we enjoyed some free chips and salsa from their complimentary chips and salsa bar for dine-in customers. They had three types of salsa - a pico de gallo style, a green chile one, and a hot salsa. All were equally delicious ... the hot salsa definitely had a big kick to it and the other two salsas were really flavorful.

As far as the food goes, the burrito was really really big ... way bigger than I had expected it was going to be. I had ordered it smothered in the green chile sauce, which I thought was just okay but the chicken, beans, guacamole, and sour cream made for a delicious combination. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried a bite of the Carne Asada tacos and they were really good as well - they had the perfect amount of onions & cilantro to compliment but not overpower the meat.

Also, the price was definitely right. I paid $8  and some change for my giant meal, half of which was leftover. We'll be back.",2014-11-13 02:41:43

At the time of this writing, I can't say I disagree. Descendant's are the best pan/square deep-dish pizzas I've had.

The shop resembles a ghetto/run-down living room with a pattern-tiled ceiling and muted wallpaper with paint marks, various artwork equally covered in marks/paint, clean wooden tables and bar stools, and two-tiered bar seating at the windows---a very interesting vibe.

Their menu features several composed combinations of toppings for pies available in small and large (8x10"", 10x14"" respectively). For two people I recommend one large. We ordered two larges with the intent of doggy-bagging for tomorrow. They also have a good selection of soda, ciders, and beers. 

We ordered an off-menu feature recommended by our server, the Berese, and the Electric Avenue, which from the sounds of the description seems to be a twist on the Hawaiian. After a considerable but still reasonable wait, out came two very handsome rectangular pies. From the golden caramelized cheese crusts, across the rich toppings, to the topmost shredded cheese and ripped herbs and drizzle, they were a sight that compelled me to dive in without thought of possibly obliterating the roof of my mouth. The crust has a pleasingly substantial chew and the crispy edges made me covet the corner pieces as one would for a pan of brownies. The vodka sauce of the Berese was delicious and paired perfectly with what seem to be a fennel and lamb mince or sausage. The Electric Avenue featuring jerk chicken and pineapple was a match made in heaven for my girlfriend, temporarily causing her to forget her hate for green onions. We wolfed down as much as the physical constraints of our stomachs allowed, and packed the rest for home.

Needless to say, we look forward to coming back for future seasonal/off-menu creations. Highly recommended.",2017-12-30 05:28:24

Second, food is all about flavor, and because the sauce at Fired Pie has no flavor it kills the whole pizza (just like MOD Pizza). 

It's a good deal: I walked by a guy eating a pizza that was so loaded with toppings there's no way they made any money on this guy; I guess it evens itself out. 

Rarely am I able to point in the direction of someone doing the exact same thing better but in this case Fired Pie executives should eat a pizza at Pizza Sudio. It's the same pizza, same deal, only with flavor.

We were offered the romance package - 2 tickets for a VIP gondola ride at the Venetian and a free dinner worth over $150 dollars! In reality, this meant a $17 shared gondola ride and dinner at a terrible restaurant whose food had no flavor.

Back to the hook, they tell you when you sign up that you will get a free breakfast/lunch buffet when you arrive and it will take 2-3 hours and not to eat anything. Since the hubby and I had no plans, we signed up for the 9:45am presentation. We get to the desk at 9:15am the next morning. We're placed in a taxi and driven 10-15 mins off the strip. We sign in and wait and wait for our assigned sale person to take us, along with others into a room where we sit through a 1.5 hour or so presentation.

When i let the sales guy know that we were not interested in buying a timeshare... he started getting an attitude. I told him straight up that we will not be buying and I didnt want to waste his time and we had plans at 1pm. He would not let us go early and was a jerk about us not trying to buy. When we started getting tired, the sales guy tried to say you need to listen to what im saying. The price started at $19k, after we said no, it went down to $15k, then when we said no again... it went down to $10k. The merry go round they send you on is a joke. First its the sales guy, then the sales manager, than the ppl who is suppose to get you your gift, then the ppl who actually get you your gift.

Overall the entire process was draining. We were there from 9:30am until 1:30pm. And their ""courtesy shuttle"" wouldn't even drop us off at our hotel.

Vibe, service, and food... Shall We?

Vibe: 
It's a pretty small set up in all honesty. There were about 6 tables but the set ups are limited from 2 to 4 chairs. This place is probably not that great for big groups but it's definitely cozy. 

Service:
The service was excellent! Everyone was nice and helpful. Most importantly... They were quick, efficient, and friendly. Absolutely in love with the service.

Now for the most important part...

Food:
The food was pretty good I gotta say. I tried the katsu, lobster balls, and karage. The karage was good and seasoned well. The Katsu was pretty crunchy which I love and breading didn't fall off. Now, I've never had lobster balls before so I wasn't prepared for what it was. I automatically thought it'd be pretty similar to takoyaki but it was pretty dense. The taste was good though. The curry was nice and flavorful but I have to honest I wish that they put a bit more.

I recently went to Catch (AFTER RENOVATIONS) and boy does it look different from what I remembered. Catch is now separate from the hotel and has an updated, modern decor. For some of you who don't know, Catch is comprised of their Oyster Bar which is now on the main floor for a more casual dining experience; and a Fine Dining restaurant portion upstairs. 

My friend and I decided to have dinner at their Oyster Bar which had a relaxed, modern feel to it with navy blue and warm hues of brown all around. There are booths all along the left side when you walk in, and a lovely open kitchen. There is also a little area close to the front where you can sit and watch them shuck your oysters.

Our server was patient, which I appreciated because I can be so indecisive. She was friendly and asked us if we had any questions on the menu. After comparing menus with the Fine Dining restaurant upstairs, the Oyster Bar may be more feasible (around $25+ for a main) - with a choice of oysters, mussels, seafood soups and salads, pasta, shrimp, risotto, and daily specials.  They have more expensive items such as 1.25 lbs Atlantic lobster, King crab, and steak. Beers at $8 a pint, and wine by the glass at $10+.

First up, we ordered their House Made West Coast Dungeness Crab Cakes with a chili aioli ($20). It came with three, no bigger than a ping pong sized crab cakes that had a crispy exterior. They were over-seasoned and the texture was off-putting since it was chewy and tough to eat. On the bright side there was a decent amount of crab and very little filler. The chili aioli had a light pleasant, lemony taste to it. 

We went on a Tuesday and had their daily special of $2 tempura prawns which was a pretty good deal. The prawn was fairly large - but was thickly coated in batter (kind of a mix of tempura and something else) and rolled around in deep fried noodles or something. It looked like a fried hairy prawn. Despite that, it was seasoned well, super crunchy, not oily, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. It came with the chili aoili. 

I couldn't leave here without trying their oysters and at $3.50/each, $18 (half a dozen) and $36 (dozen) I was expecting a mouth orgasm. Alas, like most oysters in Calgary, I was disappointed. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. They came with freshly grated horse radish, a thin chipotle cocktail sauce of some sort, and another vinegar-like sauce. I would have preferred just a lemon and tabasco, but the sauce enhanced the flavors of the oysters in a way. We had a dozen of various East and West oysters. I personally didn't enjoy the East Coast oysters as much, which had a salty, grimy, fishy after taste to them that I didn't enjoy. I like my oysters with a smoother finish.

For my main dish I ordered their oven baked line caught Alaskan Sable Fish ($23) that came with the Chef's daily selection of sides. I think this is an amazing deal compared to what you would get at a chain restaurant in terms of quality. Today it came with a butternut squash puree, barley, and bok choi. When it came out, the presentation was exquisite! Picture perfect. The fish had a really strong miso paste on top which was terrible and took away from the natural taste of the fish. Other than that, the rest of the dish was divine. The fish was cooked perfectly - super moist, flaked easily with a fork, and melted like butter in my mouth. Their butternut squash puree was my second favourite thing on the dish. Had a bright orange colour, and the texture was silky, rich, and creamy. Overall, the dish is fantastic and I highly suggest you get this fish. Either that, or cod is another fantastic choice for a white fish. Skip the salmon!

Overall, Catch's Oyster Bar (not sure of their Fine Dining menu) is a hit! The mood is perfect for a date or dinner with friends, and the food is pretty good. Yes... It is pricey, but the quality of the fish and the preparation and care that goes into the dish makes up for it. Sure there were some lows in my meal (like the crab cakes) but Catch Oyster Bar is definitely worth a visit!",2012-01-04 06:55:42

At $11.95 maybe a little more expensive than usual for a buffet but it's in North Scottsdale so not completely unexpected either. Nice interior and even looks like the patio could be a pleasant dining experience when there's nice weather, surprising considering that the restaurant is located in a fairly bland, out of the way strip mall.

The food was very tasty and will certainly sate your desire for Indian. Comparatively, it was middle of the road as far as the Indian food I've had--not the best but not the worst. But if you love Indian food like I do, you won't be disappointed. The lunch buffet has a lot of the standard dishes: chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, aloo matter, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, etc. Tikka masala is usually my favorite but theirs was just ok.

I've been spoiled by this hotel, for future Vegas trips I'll be expecting rooms as nice as this one. 

This is one of the newer hotels in Vegas, situated near the Cosmopolitan and Mandarin Oriental hotels and Crystals shopping complex. It offers the 21st century equivalent of classy, different from the Bellagio. Check-in was hassle-free and straightforward. Upon going up to our rooms, the room was clean.

Stayed here twice on standard rooms. Instantly I was hooked on the touch panel on the center screen, which basically controlled everything except the bathroom (that would be kinda creepy if it did) and call room service. You could even review your bill and check out, which is one of the best perks about this place. 

Beds were very comfortable, with the exception of snoring I had a good two nights sleep. TV was in HD and contained most of the common channels, so I was able to catch a bit of my favorite show being aired. LOVED the overall design of the rooms, gives a new meaning to contemporary and classy, from the mirrors to the drawers. If you get a room of the view, the windows are big enough to peer down at the Strip below, especially with all the lights at night. 

Bathrooms were just simply GORGEOUS. Toilet and shower/bath had its own compartments. Glass is opaque on both doors.

Service is pretty good. We had a wonderful housekeeper who brought us plenty of shampoo and shower gel, and still kept an upbeat attitude when we forgot to ask for towels initially and asked him again.",2011-12-02 20:24:33

When choosing a flavor for your bag of crustaseans or friends, ""the whole shebang"" is a must. It's a blend of lemon, garlic and cajun..YUM. Trust me, you'll never go back to one flavor once you've had that. 

When my friends and I visited, the snow crab legs were the best (I'm not a huge fan of crawfish and the shrimp was good, but boring). Even their cajun fries were fun and the wings weren't too bad either (my fiancé doesn't like shellfish very much). Oh, and you have the ability to choose your level of heat on all items.

It has to be dry aged in a special cooler in order for the meat to be tasty, and not just growing bacteria.

My husband and I came on Valentine's Day and were pretty excited based on the pics and fellow Yelp reviews...we will not be back. 

The wait was expected 30-40 minutes in our opinion was actually really really good considering the day and the area. 

We were seated at the bar as the hostess asked if it was ok, which we were fine with, give a table to a family or someone under 21. No biggie.

My husband opted for the 'build your own' Bloody Mary bar and i opted for the house/bartender makes it for me Bloody Mary, it would have to be just as good if not better than his, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Ok so the hubs makes his own drink and I literally wait 20 minutes for mine. Not kidding. Then finally when she brings me my drink she then takes our order....which doesn't come out for nearly 45 minutes. No apologies, no eye contact, no how's your drink, you haven't touched but I see you sipping off of your man's.

Ok so what was wrong with it? You know when the mix isn't stirred/shaken and the good stuff is all at the bottom? Yeah, I didn't get the good stuff or the garnishes. 

Kudos to the blond bartender working the other side of the bar who checked on her waiting patrons and offered to comp a drink if they would like another while they waited. I wish you were our waitress because service is half of a review. 

Our food was mediocre. I had the chicken and waffles which had absolutely no flavor...the hubs had the Boring Bennie and the biscuit instead of the English muffin was actually genius.

All in all the wait For food and poor service is what this review comes down too.

Years ago, there was a mexican restaurant (was very dark inside- I liked it, but hubby didn't, but it's been closed for a few years now. Only a few vacant spaces for lease. Good amount of parking, unless it's super busy at Trader Joe's (avoid on the 1st/15th). 

Situated on the left- side corner of the shopping center (from Decatur),  loved and very popular Trader Joe's (one of the busiest locations)- we pretty much go here on a weekly basis. Senior shuttles come in the late afternoon on weekdays (2 pm- 3 pm). Other customers frequent this store right after work or after the gym. Best time for us to shop: sunday morning- has the smallest crowd.

Situated kitty-corner from Trader Joe's, is Dotty's Bar- seems to be a popular place, and situated in many strip centers, all throughout the city.

Mochicko Chicken- new place I wanna try; featuring chicken fingers and chicken bowls, most under $9.99- sauces (50 cents), drinks (two sizes) and sides (tender, grilled chicken, fried egg, rice, fries, asian slaw, stiry fry veggies, hawaiian sweet roll).

Amena Bakery- middle-eastern?

Amber Unicorn Books-  a used book store (seems like there are just a few of these around now)

Fabric Store- looks like a specialty fabric store, especially for quilting 

Medical Supply

Beauty Salon- Cynthia's

Nails (another beauty salon)

Situated on the other corner (facing Decatur), US Bank- we stop by the drive-thru ATM sometimes; I think that the branch office hours are weekdays only.",2014-09-25 21:15:01

The inside of this place is actually quite small and sits maybe about 30 people or so in the main dining area when full.  There aren't too many decorations so to speak of with wooden tables, blank chairs, some up-lighting and then a TV that was showing portions of the menu but got ""stuck"" while we were there.

This last time that I was there my fiance and I ended up splitting an order of Goi Cuon which is a summer roll with shrimp and pork belly.  Then for my entree I had the con tam bo nuong bi op la which was the broken rice with beef, shredded pork and a fried egg while my fiance went with some shrimp pho.  The summer roll came out first with a sort of sweet and sour sauce and looked really good.  You could actually see the large shrimp through the fairly transparent roll.  It tasted really good too as it was nice and light and paired perfectly with the sweet and spicy sauce.  The only part of it that I didn't really care for was the pork belly but I didn't think that it really affected the flavor at all.  After we finished our appetizer the entrees were delivered.  While my meal was not exactly what I was expecting, it ended up being really good.  The beef was my favorite part of the dish and had some really good flavor.  I also enjoyed breaking the fried egg over the rice to give the rice some richness. My only complaint about our whole time here was the slowness in service.  The place was completely full and it took awhile for us to get both waited on and then for us to pay our bill.

The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  While the service was slower than I would have liked, my fiance and I both enjoyed the food that we got.",2014-09-26 00:09:30

The prices have gone up over the years but are still not overboard. I agree with others saying that the water can be, at times dusty. But I usually drink the tea with dinner anyway.

Wong's is never backed up out the door so you can get in any day, even on Valentine's which has turned into a silly tradition with me and the wife. And the service is always friendly.

Food quality was waaaaaaaay off. They were even off on our table, giving our wings to the group beside us. 

We ordered a lot of food and none of it was even what I'd consider average except for the wings, which as mentioned earlier, we had to ask the table beside us for when one of the waitresses dropped them off and left them there despite that table telling her the wings weren't theirs... So, besides the average wings, we had:
- Tofu taco = disgusting with soggy/wet tofu and a cold, store-bought flour tortilla 
- Bulgogi sausage = nothing special, a little tough and dry
- Pulled pork = a little soggy, no distinct flavor unless you doused it in the spicy hoisin sauce 
- Ramen Mac = also disgusting, giant pile of plain ramen noodles dumped in a paper boat (so, the ramen at the bottom stuck to the paper) with a gross cheese sauce carelessly pooled on top; we had to mix it up ourselves to coat all the noodles 
- Potato swirl = not as awful as the rest but desperately needed seasoning 
- Sriracha cracklings = Ok but should really be  billed as an app, not a side 

Our server offered no help or explanation of the menu, even when asked. I had to prod him to explain what the fruit punch and egg nog beers were all about. We had various servers all night long, and no one ever checked in or asked what we thought of the food. This despite them clearing trays with half-eaten items.  

We were one wing in to our apps when our dinner order appeared. There wasn't even enough room at the table to put the tray down so the sever just awkwardly stood there, staring at us until we cleared a few things away ourselves so he could drop the tray.

Wonderful flavor and great mac salad to boot.  I really enjoyed the won ton and the saimin noodles in my soup.  The rest was a little too salty for me, but good noodles alone are worth it for me and besides, others might not think too much of the sodium.  The broth flavor is very traditional Hawaiian flavor and even has seaweed in it, kamaboko, sweet egg, green onion and ham plus char shiu.  Sadly, they were out of the Hawaii-imported fried saimin.  The friendly lady there said they get shipped in every Thursday and the person who took the order had been out the previous week.  Next time fo sure!

I would've chose to go inside but dt is only available. So we ordered a king Caesar wrap, a chicken baja flatbread, a beach bum smoothie and a half turkey sandwich. So first of all, it took 5 minutes for us to order. The person greeted right away, but I have no idea what the hell he was saying. He spoke so fast and then I tried to order, but he didn't respond. So a minute or two pass by & I keep saying ""Hello?"" Then he finally takes our order for the flatbread and wrap and then stops responding.... We keep saying ""hello"" again and then another minute later he finally responds again. And he responds confused saying ""ooookay..."" Like, why was he so confused? 

So, we pull up to the window and he goes, ""So what was your order?""
I repeat everything again.
""So did you still want the wrap and flatbread or just the smoothie?""
Yes we want all the food we ordered.
""Oh okay shoot hold on let me fix that""

Like, when did I ever cancel the flatbread and wrap? Lol. Then I ask for the smoothie to be charged on one credit card, and the other 2 items on the other card. He closes the window, then runs everything on one card for some reason. Opens the window again, stares at the cards like it's something foreign then says, ""sorry hold on you want what?"" I tell him again, then he closes the window and calls someone else over to help him redo the transaction. 
I also hand him my friends lvac card for a discount, and he was very confused. He stares at that stupidly too. I respond, it's for the gym discount? Then he closed the window and doesn't ask about it again.
*Everything so far took 10 minutes already.*
10 minutes later, we finally get our food. I had to ask for the stamp card back. He forgot he even had it I guess. 

We get home and look at our receipt and he didn't even give us the discount. My flatbread was okay, kind of dry and barely had any sauce in it. The smoothie was good and the sandwich, but my friends Caesar wrap was very sloppy and had old lettuce in it! I can't believe how horrible of a visit we had.

But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi ""joint"" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.",2012-04-29 07:36:51

Their hours are Sunday-Thursday 11:30am to 11pm. Friday-Saturday 11:30am-1am.

I won't comment on the food that much. I obviously did not expect a Tremont dining experience. However, I will say that the baket potatoes were cooked well, mac n cheese was tasty enough, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries. My family members enjoyed the chicken and chicken pot pie.

Impromptu gathering last night of 5 people, and we had great food and fantastic wait staff.  The host is charismatic, charming and super nice!  He offered to give us a taste of any wine from the wine list before committing to a bottle.  When I was making a reservation for the impromptu birthday celebration I asked about bringing in my own cake and they said that was perfectly fine, but that there would be a cake plating fee, which I agreed to.  After paying the bill and coming home, I realized they did not apply the cake service fee -- I call that AMAZING customer service here in Toronto!

Both were incredibly tasty and I'm not even typically fond of mock meats. In that sense I'd pick ChuChai over Yuan any day.

The stinker with this place is that the service was seriously compromised. To be fair, we made our reservation super last minute for the end of service on a Friday night. When we arrived the host was wringing his hands telling us that a group of 30 was about to arrive. Oh boy. Service was super sporadic throughout the evening and we never received one of our plates. When we mentioned it to the server they weren't particularly phased and began to slam the kitchen staff. We were hoping to order another round of drinks, maybe even a coffee, but were very quickly ushered out once our dessert plate was cleared.

We walked away from ChuChai still kinda hungry. I don't know if that's a attributable to the food or just the fact that we didn't get a third of what we ordered. I'd maybe venture back on a quiet night.",2016-03-07 15:25:53

Really, the only selling point was the prices (big meal for under $10). I found the tempura to be heavy and greasy and the sushi to be meh. 
Recently went back to give them another chance, but this time tried the Korean part of the menu. I had the vegetarian bibimbap that comes in a hot pot. Delicious! Also, nice that they serve the red sauce in a separate dish so that you can control the spicy-ness. Plus, if you order from the Korean dishes, you get all those free side dishes:) 
So, my opinion of Hosu has improved and I would recommend trying some of their Korean dishes (and going somewhere else down the street if you want Japanese).",2010-07-08 14:25:48

The portions aren't that huge,they aren't the most flexible when it comes to substitutions . That being said I actually enjoyed the food here . My mom and brother came here last year and he was underwhelmed about the chicken. I thought it was nicely seasoned and it went well in my dish. I ordered the biscuit and gravy over chicken plate(forgot the actual name of the dish) it was really good and flavorful. The gravy was so creamy and really went good over the biscuits. I didn't understand the jalapeño garnish but I digress. My mom ordered the shrimp and grits. Now I'll admit I'm no grits fan,just don't care for the texture of them. I tasted some of her dish and it was like the best creamiest thing ever. She said the ham was really good. She got it last time she came and kept raving about it. There was something different about these grits . I'm still not a fan lol but I would order the grits dish here. The place is a bit pricey it's in between the Venetian and Palazzo after all lol. But the meal did hit the spot! Now my favorite part was the biscuits. They are so fluffy and they have like a sweet crust that's very faint on top which just makes it awesome especially with the butter spread on. The waiter was cool as well,forgot his name but it was a black man. He made us laugh when he said the waters include,Evian,bottled and Nevada tap . We got the Nevada tap. The ambiance is nice too.

HQUuPYWyteD4BxY20zdReA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,13KW8P5n1jAxxHB7Bl_obg,2,5,2,0,"Well, I had an experience very similar to reviewer Kelly C.'s. In a nutshell, the food was a joke, service was spotty, menu was inconsistent and the owner was a douche.

Here's the long story:

The wife and I drove by this place a week ago and were intrigued by the name and the Scandinavian cuisine, so we decided we'd go. We looked online at the menu choices, things seemed interesting but we didn't memorize it or anything. Well, we should have, as their table menus (printed on regular 8.5x11 paper) had very little description of all the oddly-named Scandinavian dishes; so, we had to trouble the waitress to describe them.

After all that, we ordered. I got some weird-named dish which was basically shepherd's pie and the wife ordered gravlax (kinda like salmon sheets). After ordering, I had forgotten if I had asked the waitress for the beef in my pie (the other choice is pork) so I got up and chased her down. She told me ""No problem, the kitchen's running behind so yours hasn't been started yet and I'll tell them."" Well, as you probably guessed I was served the one with pork despite waiting 30+ minutes for it to come out. Not only that, they gave us the wrong sides so I had to wait while the poor waitress went to the back to get the correct ones to even tell her of the pork deal.

I'm not some baby who can't eat pork, I simply ordered beef and wanted beef. When she got back, she apologized and picked up the plate and went to the owner to ask what to do. Said owner had been schmoozing people who were clearly the ""bottle wine buying type"" the entire time we were there. I saw her whisper in the waitress's ear, and the waitress came back and said ""I'm sorry, this is my fault but we're out of beef for this dish today and I should have told you that. I'll buy you dessert of your choice."" Well, that's great and I'm glad the waitress was nice but I don't think that is her responsibility. I also don't buy that they were out of beef; could be wrong, but come on. By this time, I was impatient and hungry so I just said ""Okay"" and ate my food.

To the food: More B.S. Not only did I get pork I didn't order, but the insult was that it was just some school cafeteria-like boneless fatless pork patty. You'd think some real scandinavian kitchen would have some kind of slow-cooked, fat dripping off delicious pork. The gravlax, which we were told was given some kind of salt dry rub had absolutely no flavor. It was just raw salmon, big deal. The only highlight here was the fermented sides like the beet and horseradish and the sauerkraut, but for a pork patty smothered with boring mashed potatoes and a weak plate of gravlax we still paid almost 50 bucks and that's *with* the free dessert (which was apparently pretty good, according to my wife- it was the citron fromage)

The owner is apparently Polish, so on that note I'm not sure what qualifies her to make a Scandinavian/Canadian restaurant; but I guess the results of this visit show that she is not qualified. Save the trip here, you can make most of this stuff at home way easier and much more cheaply with better ingredients.",2014-01-18 18:46:57

The windows were completely fogged up as well, so one can expect adequate heating inside.

The cafe takes reservations. As a customer, I guess it could be convenient to be able to guarantee myself some seats for whatever occasion, but it looks like it gets really busy during meal time, with lines going out the door as time passed.

The interior is brightly lit and the floor-plan is designed spaciously, with a wide path down the room lined with tables on the sides. As you head towards the back, you'll turn a corner and see an ATM before hitting the washrooms. Being cash-only, having that ATM does help I suppose. While the cafe isn't too big - seating for maybe 25 people - the washrooms are a bit small.

It is an open kitchen, so you can see them preparing all of the foods and desserts. If you're sitting beside the kitchen as I was, you could probably even sneak in some pictures of other people's dishes as they're put out waiting to be served if you wanted to fill out your menu collections without actually ordering all of them...

Menu comes with several dessert options such as waffles, mille-feuille, and cheesecake. Lots of lattes and teas to choose from. There are also meal items like sandwiches, salads, and baked potatoes.

Sitting beside the kitchen, I can see that dishes are prepared at a steady rate. However, given the number of people working in the kitchen and the number of orders coming through, expect to wait 5-10 mins during busy hours.

I ordered a baked potato with smoked salmon and caviar for whatever reason, mainly because I usually don't see an entire section dedicated to a potato. It was a good potato, with plenty of toppings. I think the flavors work well.

The waffles looked pretty good and came out in huge portions, so maybe I'll try a waffle next time.",2017-01-16 05:12:29

Island Fish & Chips was what I ordered. Served straight from the fryer (these were HOT) and presented in an actual bucket, I received a large piece of beer-battered cod that was placed on a mound of fries (not the thick cut) -- mound being the appropriate word. At first glance, I thought there were enough fries  to fill the entire bucket, but there's a sheet of paper that helps keep the food in place. When it comes to fish & chips, the cod wasn't the largest that I've eaten, but it's still a big piece. Crunchy and deep fried, I can't complain much; it was tasty. Fries were also crunchy and the fish didn't make them soggy. 

One last thing I'd like to mention: this is one of the cheapest fish & chips that I've eaten in Las Vegas. For $12.95 I received a large portion of food; whereas, other restaurants I've been to charge between $15-$20.

My order came out, let's start with the burrito, the tortilla was cold the meat had good flavor, but it was just carne & beans, that's it , no pico de gallo no guac, it was wrapped in a aluminum colored wrapping and came in a container with beans and rice, but the wrapped burrito was placed directly into the beans, so now that's a mess.

The large bones delivered to our table rendered their marrow easily, though it was upstaged by the orange marmalade and tomato jam that came with it. Even a tomato salad in February was successful thanks to golf ball-sized heirloom tomatoes and homemade ricotta.

I was told Ice Box is a good hike for a hot day. Which... is somewhat true but since about half of the hike is in direct sunlight and not in the 'ice box canyon,' I would say pick a day that's not a high of 103... :D It's pretty toasty until you're 'IN, IN' the canyon which is shaded and yes, significantly cooler. Also, by the time June hits, the waterfall has dried up. Check it out early Spring during ice melt. I'm sure there will be water there. 

This is not quite a challenging as Turtle Head but there's quite a bit of scrambling so it's more difficult and a bit longer than say Calico Tanks. Some heavy vegetation in some areas so you'll need to get low and duck under brush and things. There were quite a few kids when we went so it's manageable. I would say this is an easy-moderate hike--leaning toward easy. There are a couple different ways you can head into the canyon but they will all lead to the the same place. I'm convinced one is more shaded than the other. You'll eventually reach a huge, fallen tree. Just past this tree is the dried up waterfall (hopefully actually waterfall when you go).

After you order what meats/fish you would like, you are served a savory broth soup with mushrooms, a salad of green leaf lettuce pre-dressed with a tasty dressing and then Nick (or your chef) chops up and sautés an assortment of vegetables, along with freshly prepared egg-fried rice. (He cracks the egg right there, who wouldn't get a kick out of that?) All of the items (vegetables, rice and the cooked meats or shrimp) are plated by your chef, steaming hot, right onto your plate. Lets not forget the onion tower he lights on fire and chops up - altogether its a fun experience for all ages and delicious too. I highly recommend it.",2013-10-27 16:36:31

During the evening I came in for the first time, our party was immediately greeted and were given a quick summary of what was offered on the menu...a menu with a very wide selection. We were seated at the outside patio on a pleasant February, Saturday evening, which surprises me was not more greatly used at the time. We were surrounded by empty tables in the patio with candles lit up at the center and stringed lights strewn across the perimeter of the patio area. Although, you could see all the activity by the movie theater, you could feel a sense of separation from it with the lights and plants setting up a wall between the patio and the movie theater. The interior of the restaurant felt high-end casual.

It was very late in the evening, so I had no interest in a big meal. I ordered a large hot chocolate and a chocolate eclair. My companions followed suit with the hot chocolate. I guess I came up with a great idea! One of my companions selected a tiramisu while the other selected one of the specials of the night: a seafood calzone. My chocolate eclair wasn't quite what I expected. It was a chocolate eclair sliced into a pie shape. Same went with the tiramisu. My chocolate eclair was alright. It wasn't quite as sweet as I wanted it. I tried the tiramisu and it wasn't as sweet as I would have expected either. The hot chocolate was what I needed for late that night and it went well with the chocolate eclair. I didn't try the seafood calzone, but it was large and it looked tempting.

I'd never been here for dinner before, only for Dim Sum. I definitely think their dim sum is better than dinner (and likely cheaper for the same or more food). I wasn't feeling very creative and went for comfort food, so sweet and sour chicken for me. 

The portion was sizable and had a good amount of peppers and onions with it. It was flavorful and probably the best sweet and sour chicken ever. My dining companion had lemon chicken, and finished most of it. I also really like their tea. The portions are large enough that even though we were both starving, we would have had enough for lunch the next day. I didn't get enough rice, but I'm sure if we could have found our waiter, he would have brought more (another bummer about not getting dim sum - there are always TONS of employees). A weird note: the tvs were all silent with Spanish subtitles. I wasn't watching tv, but it was weird.

Now onto the bad. I really struggled with whether this deserved one or two stars. I'm giving it two because I've had so many good experiences here in the past. So we're winding up our meal and the person I was with went to the restroom. He noticed an employee wearing an apron walk out of a stall after flushing, texting, and walk past the sinks. No washing of hands. YUCK. I was glad that we had eaten already but that is just disgusting. As soon as my partner came back, the waiter asked if we wanted to to containers. Um, no thank you. If I wasn't done eating, after I heard this I was. When we left (after paying), we told the woman at the register about what happened and she was just like, ""Meh. Okay. Sorry about that"".

However, because I think when it comes to buffets they are about as good as you can get in  regards to bang for your buck. The French Market Buffet along with the Garden Buffet at South Point are my two go to buffets for the price, especially when eating with the family. I will clarify though, we RARELY eat the buffet because it is not always worth it when you aren't meat eaters. That being said - the French Market provides more veggie options than many other higher priced buffets at similar casinos, and they have a lot more seasonal fresh fruit than some strip buffets. 
We happened to go for dinner on Saturday after seeing a movie. It was about  6pm, there was no line, and we paid about $30 (including tip) which is about the same as we'd pay at another restaurant. I usually stick to Chinese and Mexican with the addition of fruit and veggies, and this night was no different. Everything seemed pretty fresh,  except for some roasted potatoes. The fruit (mostly melons) was fresh and juicy. As always the desserts were good.I think the secret to buffets is as Anton mentions - eat in courses. That is definitely the way.  What you really must know about this buffet, and any of the non-strip buffets is that the food is not the best you'd find, but not bad at all. Don't expect the best Vegas chef's but you will get a meal here that rivals the restaurants in this and other local casinos. 
On this particular occasion our service sucked, but that really was the worst we'd ever had at the this buffet. Since we don't eat the buffets often, it probably won't be until we have family in town to go back, but they are always satisfied, and so are we.",2010-07-13 03:41:43

The reason we went to Milestones was for their steaks. We were told they were out of steaks. I ordered the chicken club. I was then told they were out of the bread but could put it on a burger bun. My boyfriend ordered the burger. Food was dismal. Burger bun was too big for sandwich.
The apps were disappointing. We got the popcorn shrimp. It's a brown bag (looks cheap) with popcorn, then 6 little shrimps on top. Let's be real here, how much does popcorn cost? Next to nothing. They could of at least seasoned it. The fries as an app we wouldn't of ordered had we known we'd be getting the burgers with fries. 
We agreed we could of gone to an actual burger place (The Works) for better burgers & service.

The hot wings are decent at best, Munch's breakfast which is similar to a breakfast hash was not bad but not that good and I also ordered Joe's San Francisco special, which was definitely the best dish I had their.

Fruits and Veggies - They seem to be always fresh, so good job non-obese people! (Yeah, stereotypes....weee)

I wasn't really a fan of the cajun fries, but again, that's probably just me as I see many other reviewers love them.

We also got oyster sliders and seafood fried rice, which were also good and flavourful.
I wanted to try the lobster roll, but they ended up forgetting our order. That's okay though, we were pretty full by then anyway (and had leftover rice).

I met friends here for brunch one lazy Saturday and we had to wait about 20 minutes or so for a table, we sat at the bar and since it was almost noon, had a cocktail - they have a good specliaty list. The drink was good.

Once seated we placed an order for each of us (eggs, bacon etc) and then some french toast for the table, since all of us wanted to try that. 

My impressions:

1) Coffee cups are too small. If you are going to have coffee mugs that small, leave a carafe at the table, so we can re-pour. The coffee itself was really good quality though. I wonder if the small cups are to slow us down on drinking it all.

2) Service is very slow, but not unpleasant. They just seemed a bit confused sometimes.

3) All the food was well prepared and tasty.

4) Good ambience and cute set up.

They have a killer view of Uptown - and the roof top bar is the best.

I do have to mention that the server forgot to put in our french toast order till much later and so we had to wait for it, it didn't come out with the other items as requested.",2015-04-01 21:28:42

After grabbing one or two 32 ounce G&T's, after walking in the sheer magnitude of the showroom is evident...or so you think.

When that curtain rises and things begin to happen and it is then you ask yourself if your eyes are playing hell with you.  It is then that you realize just how big this production is.

Not wanting to give anything away I will say that the spectacle of stunt performances, special effects, music, costumes and the ohhhhh so impressive multi functioning, rotating, shape shifting monster of a stage is pretty damn incredible.

I am a simple man with a very simple brain, so at times I became lost and confused in the plot.  Not the show's fault but my own.

Just a word of warning...THEY SECURE THE RESTROOMS AT THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE.  Do not drink 64 oz. of Gin with a splash of tonic or YOU will PAY!

iqumP3QWSqyh0SOlnhmL9A,AwyM03qzhwgyskBruurWQw,tjAeaGdxf7I4xN9M7wGJNQ,4,7,4,5,"Pizza today is a tale of two cities- the one ordered en masse for speedy consumption by hungry hordes, the other on a smaller scale, as a chance for food artisans to show their chops, for everything from the crust to the mix of toppings showcased on top.  Pure Pizza, with its focus on locally-sourced ingredients, is new to town but quickly showing great promise amongst the artisan crowd.  

Tucked into the 7th Street Market, Pure resembles little more than a food vendor at your local indoor mall, in that there is a counter and a series of glass guards separating you from the ""kitchen.""  A menu board overhead describes the offerings and options available.  Seating is basic and plentiful in the middle of the market.

A quick look at the menu reveals a number of different pizzas and salads.  Pizzas come in 3 different sizes and in your choice of 2 different crusts- a basic white and a sprouted wheat/ancient grain.  Salads come in a choice of either a large or a small serving.

On my visit, the wife and I opted for a fresh arugula salad with goat cheese and a chorizo pizza on the sprouted wheat crust.  The salad was uber-fresh and bright with flavors.  With a lively lemon vinaigrette, it was like spring in bowl.  One minor quibble- the dressing was so cold the oils were semisolid, so we had to bring that up to temp a bit before pouring it over the salad.

The pizza, though, was brought out fresh from the oven and was worth the trip alone.  The crust had a great combination of crackling on the outside combined with a light and chewy interior.  That's no easy task with whole grains, but they have pulled it off well.  Choirzo was spicy and the cheese was a great contrast to it.  My favorite part?  The pepper-infused honey they give you to dip your crust into.  Unqiue and a great contrast to the savoriness of the pie.  Given that ingredients are farm-to-fork, it just adds to the experience to know you are eating seasonal and local foods that support area farmers.  

Though we were stuffed, it was not hard to look up at the menu and imagine some of the other pizzas being equally good.  Everything from a classic margarita to a T-rex for the meat lovers sounded very good and will be worth a future visit.  Even breakfast is not out of the question as they have a smaller menu with 3 different pizzas there- each combining a egg on top of a pizza with as assortment of other ingredients.  Sounds tempting to me.

Given that Pure is right next to a bakery and with an artisnal coffee shop just across the way, you can get you fill and quench your foodie cravings all in one spot.  Combine that with 2 hour validated parking in uptown and you have a winner.

Pure is a welcome addition to the 7th Street Market and they fulfill a unqiue and developing niche in the pizza market.  Not a place to take the family when it's time for a quick dinner out, but a great spot for enjoying locally-sourced food prepared with skill and care.  Pure Pizza is so far pure goodness.",2012-04-30 14:28:04

We were seated promptly and a server stopped by to say hello and asked us to give him a few minutes. No problem, it was busy. My friend ordered the Fire-Grilled Pineapple Salsa Salmon and I ordered the Braised Beef Skillet with a salad on the side, no cucumbers.

Our orders arrived and there was a big piece of cucumber in my salad. Good thing I'm not allergic to it, I just don't like cucumbers. My friend enjoyed her salmon and thought the portion was just right. My beef skillet, however, I don't think lived up to its advertising. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't as tender as it should/could have been and it could have used a little more seasoning.

We finished our meal with a couple of mini desserts that weren't bad.

Saturday 7pm - great vibe, not too crowded - mostly families hanging out. We had a drink a the bar while our teen boys played a game of pool. Bartender kept us entertained with the story behind Gold Spike's renovation.

Saturday 10:30pm - ID at the door (21+ only), lots more security, lots more people - crowd was mixed but probably early 30ish.

Sunday 1pm - popped in for another drink to watch some of the game. $7 for a Hoegaarden? Definitely fewer people but pretty chill. Still lots of security about - which is a good thing downtown.

food prices were cheap, in my eyes. staff was standing around talking to each other the whole time, while WILLY WONKA was played continuously, looped, on some tv screens scattered around.
nobody said good-bye or thanks on our way out, we had to ""cut"" through a group of staff to leave..........one odd note, a server sat a rack of clean glasses on the floor to stock a service cart.....just gross.....if this is what they do when we're looking, what's going on behind the scenes?

Now that's something i could get used to! :)

The rooms have this grand entrance when you walk in:  EVERYTHING turns on!  All the lights, the TV, and curtains are all on and open.  Fancy!  The technology in this room can be a bit challenging.. and sometimes the iPad next to the bed lags.  It would've been nice to have an outlet next to the bed to charge my phone.

It has a romantic feel so I'd definitely recommend this place as a couples getaway destination (my king room can fit 2 people comfortably, 4 would be pushing it!)  Personally for me?  It feels so far away from everything happening in Vegas.  It's not as busy as the other casinos, and there's really nowhere to really just grab a bite - everything is sit down.

The neat thing is there's an AV panel in the room - so you can connect your iPod/iPhone, HDMI, USB, and audio stuff - the catch?  You have to have your own cables (or you can open the weighed box on the counter they'll probably charge you like $50! lol).  So, bring your cables from home if you want to hear your own music - this was a huge disappointment for me because I have so much music on my phone and couldn't play it.

I was at Sushi Inn for dinner this past weekend with two of my girlfriends and I ordered my lovable spicy tuna, along with their dynamic roll (similar to the dynamite roll you find at other sushi houses) and plain but yummy salmon maki.

Other faves I must suggest at Sushi Inn:

- Seaweed Salad (Seasoned with sesame oil and it always green and crunchy)

- Nabeyaki Udon (A delicious and amazing noodle dish with veggies and seafood, perfect for people who are not into sushi but love other types of Japanese food)

- SUSHI .... my faves are this place are the spicy tuna or spicy salmon, unagi (BBQ eel) and their HUGE futo maki roll which would please any vegetarian's tastebuds


Overall, Sushi Inn is a great stop which is inexpensive and casual. The only thing I shall warn you about is that you will wait for a bit for a table at prime dinner hours on a weekend!",2009-05-26 05:36:34

These are the hazards of living here.  I say this because it's really evident by some of the attitudes in some of these reviews, and, quite frankly, as someone who lives and works down the street (both less than 2 blocks) from Grabba Green, it's embarrassing.  If you had a bad experience, fine rate it low, but the whole world is not out to get you - get a grip.

I gave Grabba Green 5 stars, because for what they're doing, they're great at it.  I go here for a juice or smoothie each morning, and 90 percent of the time for lunch 'boxes'.  The staff is really nice, they move quick, and they listen - which is really important.  My juices are always exactly what I expect, as I've juiced a lot at home.  It's nice to not have the mess or constant trips to the grocery store, though!  There is also a wide selection of what you can add to your juice or smoothies, which I love.

The meals are a great value.  10 bucks for organic and whole foods, that give you great nutrition? um, yes.  I've always done a 'create my own' so I cannot personally attest to any of those that are recommended on the menu.  I can say that my own combinations were tasty and well cooked.  I also love that they have many different low fat sauces to pick from that are full of flavor.  It shows that the person who designed the menu put a lot of thought into it.

Grabba Green is a juice bar, with nutritional food.  If you're not someone making an effort to eat better (like whole grains and food rich with nutrients) it may just not be the place for you.  As someone who is actively trying to eat healthier, it's lovely to have it around.  Lastly, as to the cleanliness, it's always been clean when I go in.  

The only improvements I can suggest are that sometimes the morning employees look like they just rolled out of bed, but the blonde woman who usually works mornings, and appears to be the 'lead',  is always pleasant, well put together, and kind.  I'd also like to see them open at 7 AM during the week so I can ensure I get my juice every morning!",2013-09-04 19:43:14

I'm African on my dad's side, so growing up I never was able to eat authentic African food unless I was visiting my family in Texas. Living here in AZ there aren't many African restaurants as all, so this place really fills that demand. 

So here's my review:
Consistent! This is the key word when describing this place, the food and service is always consistent. I had it for the first time four years ago and fell in love, still till this day the food is just as amazing!!! I'll keep this short but I will leave on this note... if you're looking for quality, authentic  African food, look no further!
I'm Cameroonian and the owner of this gem is Nigerian, but since our countries are so close together there are very few differences in our food. If you really want to explore African cuisine, this is a great place to start.

The sausage had great flavors, but had a stingy portion control on them of only four pieces. For a dollar or more the portion was doubled. Ended the meal with the Jack Daniels sauced bread pudding. Great flavors and was very delicious. Friendly customer service with a smile. Overall good experience!",2014-10-12 13:56:31

Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good. 

It's really not fair to Le Cirque that this was our dinner the night after a magical time at Guy Savoy (GS), but that's how the cookie crumbled. 

The gaudy interior took me back to Joël Robuchon and made me long for the clean and modern space of GS:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#Pz6MCvMoqe20cjiEN61ICA

We elected the full Degustation Menu and each got different things to maximize the number of dished to try. At $135pp plus $88 to share a wine pairing, Le Cirque really sticks it to you, which I'm fine with if the food is great. 

In short, we were not impressed by much and some of the food was just bad. The service was stuffy, borderline arrogant at times, and without stealth. Pretty much the opposite of GS. 

It wasn't all bad though, the poached egg with caviar ($15 extra) was very nice. The veggies were cooked right and the paprika crostini was a delight;

Went for brunch on a Sunday and our group was seated fairly quickly. The clean and beautiful decor captured my eye. There was a bridal shower going on next to our table and they were taken care of nicely by the servers.

Our waitress and waiter were attentive and friendly. Started off with bread and butter, would have liked some oil and vinegar because that makes me think Italian. After looking at their menu for 15 minutes, because I couldn't decide from all the amazing choices, I ordered the Tuscany Harvest Salad. Came with grilled chicken,  mushrooms, bacon, almonds, Gorgonzola cheese, apples, dried cranberries, crispy lavoush, and Tuscan dressing. It was DELICIOUS! 

I still had room for dessert and their dessert platter had a nice variety so I went with the BRIO's Famous Cheesecake which was creamy and topped with caramalized sugar and creme anglaise. Every bite I took made me fall in love all over again. 

Their brunch menu has some great choices and I would not mind returning to this place or hosting a dinner party. Good choice, glad we yelped it. It's located in a town center so parking can be a pain but there are plenty of shops to walk around in.",2012-05-31 14:41:43

My daughter decided she wanted the A/C instead of enjoying a warm, pre-summer evening on the patio. Thankfully the A/C wasn't too cold. Chilly but not arctic (a plus in my book). 

Service was prompt, friendly and helpful. We ordered hot wings for an appetizer and they were an equal mix of wings and drumsticks yay for us!! The hot was tingly hot and just right! 

Our main dish was the 12"" thin crust Meatless Pizza with spinach, tomatoes, red onion, bell peppers, cheese and sauce. It also includes mushroom but hellllllll no, not on my pizza. 

It was cut into tiny squares which was a pleasant surprise. We throughly enjoyed. Every. Last. Bite. It was more than enough for two people and was just right.

This was our first and definitely last visit with these Bros.  We came in for a late lunch.  It was somewhat busy, but not that busy, and yet chaos ensued as the hostess seated some people, ignored others (like us), then seated some more out of order, and oh, you twos just standing there need a table too (um, no, we just like to walk into places and stare at others as they eat).  Eventually we are directed to a dirty table and wonder if we are supposed to order at a counter or a server comes to the table.  In hindsight, I am glad that it was dirty because I saw a bucket of dirty water on a bar stool where the hostess would repeatedly dip an old towel into and wipe down tables. 

The menu is primarily sandwiches, fries, soup and chili.  The big deal is that they put fries and slaw on top of your sandwich, and it looks like a monster sized sandwich.  As we continue wondering about the ordering process, a very bored looking young man comes over and takes our order.  I chose the Ragin Cajun chicken sandwich, and my husband chose the Pastrami and a side of fries.  

The first items to arrive at the table are the diet cokes.  The menu does not offer a range of sizes, so we figure, it's a standard size or a large.  Wrong.  It's a child's size drink except there is no lid.  I guess spills not a worry here because that bucket of dirty water is ready to go.  And also no straw, but I spyed some on the bar so I helped myself.  Next the fries came out.  They looked like fresh cut fries, and we munched on those as we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more for our sandwiches to come out.  My husband said fries were soggy, and I said they are fresh like Inn N Out.  I was wrong.  Please forgive me Inn N Out, I was just delirious with hunger, they are nothing like yours!  Sandwiches kept whizzing past us, and no kidding, everyone around us had theirs, even people who ordered after us.  I think bored young man went home or found something less boring to do than wait on us.  Finally, sandwiches come out, and they do this weird thing where they barely cover them in paper and just plop them down on the table, no plate of any kind.  My sandwich looks pretty good, but taste wise, there's nothin Ragin about that Cajun.  Fries in sandwich and those we ordered on the side, extremely lacking salt, and as my husband said, soggy.  Slaw on sandwich is just cabbage in vinegar which is fine with me because it's healthier, but again it lacked seasoning.  I ended up pulling chicken out of sandwich and just eating that alone.

In fact, a few Yelpers were so excited that they posted positive reviews of this place before the restaurant opened- not cool!

This review is based on the three times I have been there.  The first time I went I ordered the pastor taco, shrimp taco and a chicken enchilada.  While the tacos were flavorful and not too spicy, the chicken enchilada was kind of a mess.  The entire enchilada needed to be cooked more.

On the second occasion, I had the Super Nachos.  There was nothing super about the Super Nachos except I had a super stomachache after I ate them.

I returned today and decided to go with the tacos again.  As today was Taco Tuesday, Los Taquitos was offering chicken, carnitas and el pastor tacos for just $1.00 a taco.  The chicken taco I ordered was very tasty but the two other tacos were actually kind of nasty.  Today the el pastor taco was incredibly spicy while the other day it was mild..

Consistency is important and hopefully Los Taquitos will figure it out.  It also would be nice if they had more salsas available or some sort of salsa bar to liven the tacos up.",2016-06-01 10:03:58

I try to stay as healthy as possible when lunching throughout the week because I know that when the weekend hits I'll be taking down some calorie inflating meals.

I first started ordering the salads. I would get the garden salad stocked full of tomato, cucumber, peppers, roasted chicken and an egg. Protein ""loco"" or ""loca"" cuz I'm a chick! The chicken is very tender and juicy, the egg when added to the salad is sunny side fried? A little strange but doable. Now the greens I have a problem with! Romain would make such a difference. They get the standard mixed greens but at times it can be pretty bitter. Too much ""octopus"" lettuce that is hard to chew. The last time I ordered the salad was greasy from the egg and I can't get it anymore.

One of the reasons we order from Spaks is because the Dr. at  my practice is super strict about her diet and enjoys the vegan friendly choices. Faux pepperoni, cheese, wings, and seitan. I've tried them all and they are scrumptious! Now when we order I get the seitan melt. Not the salad option that I prefer but until I can get some Romain it will do. Ok it's better than ""it will do"" Soft buttery bread with all the veggie fixings I require. I think I just feel guilty because of the high carb count in the bread. 

The pizza is also well made, one of the best in Pitt. Of course the most outstanding item on the menu is the seitan wings, spicy and crunchy just how I like them!",2011-03-21 16:12:39

It was still open at 11 p.m. which is rare for anything popular in this sleepy town. It was pretty busy and people were eating at the benches in the front. We ordered two grilled cheese, fries, mozz sticks and a plain and cherry limeade(which i guess is their signature drink). The menu is different from traditional fast food and is more like Steak n Shake. They have dogs, chili fries, and frozen drinks to add to the usual burgers, etc.

The grilled cheese was fluffy, not flat or greasy like Denny's makes it. I like flat and greasy, just look at my old girlfriends. The fries were bland but limp. I like limp, which McDonald's seems to have forgotten how to make. The mozz sticks were tasty and at $3 an order, about half what they would cost at a bar. The limeades were refreshing, but not something i would call my signature drink. Admittedly, i couldn't appreciate the whole experience without getting a dog or a burger, so some might like the food more than i.

Service was fast and on roller skates(in case you really need that kind of pitiful novelty during your meal). The location at Snow and Broadview is central to a lot of suburbia, but there is nothing else to do around there.

It is quite upsetting when restaurants do that. Because when you see something appealing to yourself, that kind of mindsets you on these dishes (particularly if you already had them and want to repeat the experience). When restaurants change the menu frequently some of them say on the web that it's just a sample of what you can see, but not the exect menu of the day. Some post the exect menu at the day of serving it. But at least a patron knows what to expect.

Arriving one late snowy afternoon for lunch, I was surprised at the relaxed, dark wooden decor that would otherwise belong in a chic restaurant like Moxies or Milestones.  It had more of a lounge seating that doesn't reflect the name on its signage, Cafe Mirage.  

Having been informed that this place is under brand new management, I was invited to try this place out from my usual spots of Joon's or Nome Izakaya across the street!  

We were warmly greeted at the door by the hostess, who showed us promptly to our table. A gentleman working on the laptop in the corner near the entrance took great interests in how and where the hostess was taking us to, of whom I can only assume was the manager or the new owner. He had multiple copies of the menus nearby and didn't wear the restaurant's uniform.

Anyway, upon seating in their very comfortable dark cushioned seating, our waitress took our drink orders. I had a Stella while the others in my group ordered beer as well.  Quickly glancing at the menu, it was very similar to Moxie's or Milestones, maybe even Pickle Barrel.  However, the presentation more elegant and was packed with photos of the foods, savouring our appetites of what would be a great meal to come.   The dessert section at the back of the menu featured a huge plate of waffles and two different kinds of ice cream drizzled with chocolate syrup and strawberry syrup, topped with whip cream.

Today, the pastas section won me over as I ordered something seldom seen at most non-Italian restaurants: spaghetti bolognese. The others in my group ordered the NY Steak, and the all day breakfast featuring 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes with toasts and fruit medley.

After 10-15 minutes, our food came.  During the wait, our waters were filled up without asking, our waitress came around and asked if we wanted more beer as well.

I was delighted with how my spaghetti bolognese came in what must be the coolest pasta plate/bowl hybrid I've ever seen. It looked very fancy like it belonged in a much higher end restaurant.   I was all too eager to bite into the pasta.

The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was not too thick nor too watery, it was just right. There were ample ground beef in the sauce, just like it should be bursting with flavor. It tasted better than any spaghetti bolognese I've had in a long time. There was also a wedge of garlic bread that came with the spaghetti.  Did I mention that portions were bigger than meets the eye? For around $17 for this dish, you get more than your money's worth!  I really enjoyed the sauce, subtle hints of tomatoes, garlic, chive danced around with the marinated ground beef in a medley of flavor!   

Alas, I could not finish my lunch and had to take it away.  

A quick survey of my friends whom were with me and they too enjoyed their meals and thought the portions were more than they expected.  

One of them ordered the dessert I briefly mentioned earlier in my review.  I fell into temptation and had to try it and my goodness, by the end I was ready to blow at the seams.  Two large full slices of waffles, a few scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, topped with syrups and strawberries...  We tried and tried and finally was able to finish it. 

Throughout the meal we noticed that the place was getting more and more busier, surprising as it was a Sunday afternoon around 3-4pm.  A lot of people seem to come here for the desserts at this time, something I would find out later that this place is known for.

Despite being grand at desserts, their regular food menu offerings weren't too bad at all.

I'll definitely be back to try their other foods like their salmon, or eggs benedict as they also do brunch. We left satisfied with Mirage, and would definitely consider coming back, having had a great experience on our visit.

We ordered the calamari and the blue crab and artichoke dip as starters. The blue crab and artichoke was delicious,  the whole table fought over the little bit left on the plate. 

Two out of five of us ordered the California chicken! The chicken was so tender just melts in my mouth, and goes perfectly with the sweet potato fries.. i know not everybody loves sweet potato fries like me but they were just the perfect match.

There are better places for dim sum, even in the downtown core, at pretty much the same prices. No, they don't all have giant red signs, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. I felt like I was eating gelatinized rice flour with a little bit of shrimp for the shrimp rice rolls.. and aside from that i don't remember much (and nothing being especially good, either).

I fell in love with this super modern, family oriented, indoor out door seating Italian restaurant when my favorite unfiltered dame introduced me to North Italia in Scottsdale!  

The vibe is welcoming and the fresh made daily pasta & pizza dough is delicious!

Our overall service was pretty consistent considering their recent grand opening! 

FOOD
Crisp Calamari $13 I highly recommend North's golden brown calamari paired with arugula and lemon of course. Grand portion size for the price. 
Tortellini $17 This vegetarian friendly main dish was smaller than I anticipated but filling considering the additional food ordered. 
Daily Pizza (Potato Spinach) $14 ""SURPRISINGLY SPICY"" (our server failed to mention this helpful tip before ordering). I totally forgive our server for the mild burst of flames we exhaled because she was super sweet & truthfully I'm about that zesty spice life. My first potato pizza ever and I was pleased. 
Dirty Almond Chai $5.00 This latte was refreshing & filthy at the same time. I enjoyed every sip! 

Helpful Tip: DON'T SKIP DESSERT!!!
Dessert was ""on the house"" compliments of management (very generous goodwill gesture) but I honestly would have paid double for the Tiramisu & Budino! They are both that savory & sweet!! For a nominal fee of $7 each; just do it and thank me later! Capiche?

It was strawberry/vanilla white cake with a strawberry-flavoured buttercrème frosting. It was alright tasting - but definitely not worth the $2.56 price. The cake was smaller than other places I've tried and both the cake and the frosting had a greasy, heavy feeling. I love butter as much as the next person but this had way too much. I prefer a light, fluffy cake. 

Later, I tried bits of my friend's selection and the chocolate varieties were way lighter and tastier. The vanilla cupcake had the same heavy, greasy feel as the strawberry.

With its proximity to the theater district and abundance of free parking, we often plan to hit up a new spot in Asia Town before catching a show at the theater.

Wonton Gourmet was great!  Friendly, prompt service, and excellent food!  We had the wonton soup to start, and then for entrees we ordered the Szechwan Chicken and Beef with Chinese Eggplant.  The beef dish was a little spicy, but both were excellent!

The atmosphere was your standard Chinese restaurant with one unusual feature: the large-screen TV in the back of the restaurant that was playing a Chinese variety show, which I can only describe as a variation on America's Got Talent in Mandarin.  Everyone else in the restaurant was watching with rapt attention, so we tuned in, and it turned out to be entertaining!

Most entrees were $10 or less, and we enjoyed eating the leftovers for three days.  You could really do well to share a small appetizer and an entree.

I will say that the menus were a little confusing for this first-timer: there were three separate food menus, and by the time we left, I still couldn't figure out how they were organized, but they also have helpful huge color photos on the walls that correspond to the numbers on the menu, so that helped, too.

With every item she asked ""is that it"" NO, we would like to continue ordering if possible..... read back the order and somehow we had a chicken chimi at the top of the list. had to revise that for a 3rd time.

It's been a long time since I've had a good butter chicken roti, and this may be one of the best. People always rave about nearby Island Foods (a different cuisine, I know) but Mother India blows it out of the water. It's not even a contest.

I got it ""mild/medium"" and my friend got ""medium/spicy"" and both were spiced accurately to our preference.

To me what makes or breaks a butter chicken dish is the quality of the sauce -- and their makhani sauce is fantastic. It's rich, creamy, and I was savouring every bite. If it was a few bucks cheaper, I'd be here more often.

Update: I went back and upped it to ""medium"" which was still good, but I'll stick with ""mild/medium"". If you prefer to taste the flavours without being overwhelmed by spice, I think it's a good spice level. Everyone is different though!

Oh, and I've been told this thing has a ton of calories... but with the sauce being as rich and creamy as it is, I guess I'm not surprised. Haha.",2017-09-10 02:11:58

My gel manicures and fancy ""fades"" are a hit with my friends and they last at minimum three weeks.  I give her 5 stars! She is the only reason I've returned though, as the salon is messy and unkept.  There's too much stuff everywhere, there's messy personal items in client spaces, used towels, water bottles, trash, and there is little evidence that tools are cleaned. I hate to say that but I'd be a regular more often if they really cleaned the salon up. If you go, book with Jenny!",2015-09-26 03:31:06

The car lot was very organized and having their own section. It ranged from luxury, trucks, suv, sedans etc.

You want a true hidden gem in the city? Look no further than Solstice.

Tucked away in the back of a strip mall adjacent to another mall is a place that I'd been jonesing to visit for quite some time. Knew of Jean Paul and the rest of the team, covered it in stories, the usual. When I heard that the Taste of Clarkson event was running through August, I knew I needed to make it a priority to have dinner here. Four of my friends joined me on this epic endeavor and we were blown away by the quality of the food and service.

Everyone went for the 3-course $30 prix-fixe promotion, with came with a choice of appetizers (salad, watermelon gazpacho or grilled octopus), mains (California strip steak, steelhead trout or seafood paella) and dessert (let's just disregard the other options - we all went for the cheesecake).

I was glad I'd made a reservation, because the place was hopping when I got there. We found ourselves seated very quickly, and our server was generally prompt and on-the-ball when it came to asking us if we needed anything.

Everything was delicious across the board. I wish I'd taken a photo of the octopus, but I was so hungry I just dove in then and there. Polished the whole plate off. I'm uncertain if I've had octopus in the past, but what I tried was bursting with flavor in every bite. Great presentation as well.

The steak was the star of the show, and it was incredible. Nice, meaty portions with a great selection of seasonal vegetables, including white radish and carrots. Found myself sitting back to savor every bite. You know a meal is good when five people all shut up at once and spend several minutes chewing away in culinary bliss.

We ended the night off with the ""Canada 150 cheese cake jar"", a somewhat-smaller portion of layered strawberries and a kind of undone cheesecake base. It was a perfect capper to the meal, though I wished the portion size had been just a touch bigger. It's a moot point, though.

I'm kicking myself when I realize I didn't visit before now. I need to go back again!",2017-07-09 15:47:00
